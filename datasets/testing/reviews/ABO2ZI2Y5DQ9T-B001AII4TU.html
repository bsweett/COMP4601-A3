<meta name="summary" content="Funny with Good Jokes, But No Biting Satire of the Original"></head><body><p>There is nothing wrong with "Shrek the Third." And nothing special either. That's what I thought after watching the film, which is certainly entertaining thanks to the wonderful voice cast and funny gags, but the funny part does not include the wicked and clever humor of the first "Shrek" film.<br /><br />Perhaps its weak story and unmemorable new characters ought to be blamed. Well, to be honest, the idea of a young, spoiled boy `Artie' who is brought from a high school by Shrek to be the king of "Far, Far Away" is not as interesting as Prince Charming, now second-rate actor playing himself on stage, returning as villain to take over the kingdom. The third "Shrek" tries to incorporate the first plot into the second while the latter has much more potential as the background story for side-splitting comedy.<br /><br />And we are told that Shrek is going to be a father, and through the unlikely friendship with rebellious Artie the green ogre learns to be one. That is not a bad idea, I admit, but at the same time it shows that "Shrek," both its characters and story, are now getting closer to the world and its values (Disney, for instance) which the original "Shrek" was poking fun at so effectively.<br /><br />In fact, funny as they are, the jokes in "Shrek the Third" have become more like familiar types that can be seen elsewhere. They borrow bits from "King Arthur" story (including retired Merlin, voiced by Eric Idle), bits from "losers" of the fables (such as Captain Hook), bits from "princesses" of famous tales (like Cinderella), but the film's script fails to develop any of these ideas.<br /><br />"Shrek the Third" is not a bad film. It is just average. But "average" is not something that we expect from Shrek and these lovable characters.</p></body></html>

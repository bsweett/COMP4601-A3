Robert Zemeckis does a masterful job of combining Spielberg-era special-effects magic with a script that conjures up ever giddier heights of hilarity. Just when you think it can't get any funnier or cleverer, Zemeckis ups the ante. Helping him do so are the brilliant cast, led by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Fox's performance can only be described as a cross between the young Mickey Rooney and the young Bob Hope, and I can think of no higher praise. As for Lloyd, only Gene Wilder in the modern cinematic era can match Lloyd's sublime comic derangement. It's too bad, then, that the sequels fall so short of the standard set by the original. Back to the Future II--depicting the chaos done to posterity when Biff steals the time-traveling DeLorean for a joy ride--matches the original in cleverness and perfection of structure, but it's so mean-spirited that it's hard to watch. Considering the constant pummeling Marty McFly takes in this installment, only people who hate Michael J. Fox could really enjoy it!  Back to the Future III, which sends Marty and Doc Brown back to the Wild West, recaptures the original's sweetness, but unlike the first two has plot holes you can drive a stagecoach through. I might watch the sequels occasionally, but only to remind myself how much better the original is.</p></body></html>

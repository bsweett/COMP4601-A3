<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film of All-Time!"></head><body><p>The incomparable Jimmy Stewart stars as everyman George Bailey, an adventurous dreamer in his youth who feels repeatedly held-down and shackled by a small-town life that he cannot seem to escape throughout his adult years. A group of angels look down on George as he grows from boyhood to adulthood and experiences wonderful moments brought about by seeming defeats and sidetracks from his own hopes and dreams. When we finally catch up with George in modern-day (the late nineteen-forties), a sudden moment of desperation on Christmas Eve has driven him to thoughts of suicide. Convinced that the world would be better off if he'd never been born, the angel Clarence comes to George to show him otherwise by introducing him to a bleak world that never knew him and all the good that he has done.<br /><br />Directed by Hollywood fave Frank Capra in 1946, "It's a Wonderful Life" was forgotten soon after its initial release despite being nominated for multiple Oscars. However, an amazing thing happened when the film fell into public domain decades later. Repeat viewings on television gradually made the film a Christmas tradition and one of the most beloved films of all time. To this day, I personally consider it to be the best film ever made (though it is not my absolute favorite film or even favorite Christmas film, but definitely among them). "It's a Wonderful Life" has it all. So many moments of this movie are pure magic caught on film, sometimes even by accident! The performances are fantastic, the passion of the telephone scene is something you'll never forget, and the ending is sure to leave you in tears!<br /><br />"It's a Wonderful Life" has been released several times on DVD. I still have one of the earliest versions myself, if not THE earliest. Mine is the Silver Screen Classics release by Artisan, and it's quite satisfactory. The double-sided disc holds the film on side A and 3 extra features on side B. The features are the theatrical trailer, a Making Of documentary hosted by Tom Bosley, and "A Personal Remembrance" hosted by Frank Capra, Jr., which features interviews with Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. Whichever version of the DVD you get though, be sure to get one, because this film is an annual must-watch at the very least! And, if you like this one, look for "The Bishop's Wife" (1947) and "Miracle on 34th Street" (1947) if you want to have the three best classic Christmas films ever! Actually, I need to pick up those other two myself!</p></body></html>

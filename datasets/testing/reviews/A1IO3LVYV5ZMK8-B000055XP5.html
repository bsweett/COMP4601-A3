<meta name="summary" content="X-TRAORDINARY"></head><body><p>Just when I thought comic adaption was a dead genre, X-MEN by Bryan Singer of the Usual Suspects fame has scripted a movie packed full of stupendous CG graphics and more importantly an enchanting allegory to life.<p>The clash between Magneto and Professor X and the human intensity in the action-packed drama captivates, because of a tight script and a well-ensembled cast boasting credible acts from Anna Paquin as Rogue and the enigmatic Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. It dissects a human drama between the difference of a mutant and ordinary, of race and segregation, and it makes the audience feel for the idiosynacractic ways that the mutants handle their grief of being ostracized. Professor X is suitably diginified; Ian McKellen as Magneto is embittered.<p>The fluid CG graphics add a sparkle to the action scenes where you see Wolverine and Storm wielding their power against Toad and Mystique and Bryan Singer has impressively incorporate so many characters in one show and yet able to make each and every hero alive. The only thing you blame is - there isn't deep characterization for every one of them, but that's understandable. <p>It's such fun and nostalgia to see your heroes and heroines battle out,criticizing the accuracy of the portrayal. But in the end - you realize the impact of X-MEN's popularity is the grandeur of the solid human dissection between good and evil.</p></body></html>

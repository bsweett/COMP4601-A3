<meta name="summary" content="Jaws Universal 100th Anniversary on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>Okay, here we have a film released in 1975 that scared the pants off of me and made me jump out of my seat, completely blowing my cool in front of a 1st date.  Amazed that she hung around for a 2nd date.  I have the previously released Jaws on Standard Def with DTS 5.1 audio which I thought was pretty decent.<br /><br />I guess I didn't know what I was missing and though it went against my frugal nature, I paid full pop for this new Blu Ray release.  The video transfer to Blu Ray is just about the best you can or will find anywhere and is completely demo worthy.  The details in each frame, the coloration of the entire movie are totally outstanding.  Even the extra which documents the reproduction of Jaws onto Blu Ray was interesting and informative.  Deleted scenes, outtakes, making of and many more extras are included.  A DVD SD copy is included which I haven't viewed and probably will not though I am sure the color correction and clarity are probably amazing for Standard Def fans.<br /><br />The audio is now DTS 7.1 and though some might disagree,  I would not say that the audio is demo worthy for anything other than excellent clarity and a broad soundstage across the front 3 channels.  Except for the underwater scenes and a few other foley effects, the rear surrounds are not really used very much as discreet channels.  The chaos on the beach could have easily used the rear channels some more,  Never the less, Universal wanted to stay true to the original release and I understand why the rears were not employed very often.  I am just saying that if I want to show off the audio section of my home theater, I would not use this release.  My home theater is fairly esoteric and hi end and audio is something I am always aware of.<br /><br />In some ways, Universal has cut its own throat.  If they can reproduce such an old movie resulting in a film better seen on this release than they saw originally in the theaters, then there is no excuse for such sloppy releases of old movies that are being  transferred to Blu Ray.  Universal.....if you can do it here, you can do it for any of your films.<br /><br />A great release, a must release.<br />Hopefully, this review has been helpful, and if so, click on that help button so I know I am on the right track.</p></body></html>

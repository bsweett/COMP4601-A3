<meta name="summary" content="Harold and Kumar Show the Audience A Good Time"></head><body><p>I HATED "Dude, Where's My Car?", so when I learned that its director was making a movie called "Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle", you can understand that I just rolled my eyes at the thought.  However, the newspapers and web sites gave it good reviews, so I started to warm up to the concept of seeing it.  When I did, I was pleasantly surprised not only at the humor, but at the intelligence of the film (the humor was what I was expecting, but I actually found it funny).<br /><br />Harold Lee (John Cho) is a Junior Investment Banker while his best friend and roommate Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) is (not) trying to get into med school.  Harold is a little uptight and repressed, while Kumar is very easygoing.  The two also enjoy marijuana.  So one night, the pair gets high and gets the munchies, and they decide to go to White Castle.  Along the way, they run into nearly every imaginable setback (flat tire, getting lost, stolen car), as well as some unimaginable ones (Harold gets knocked out while riding a cheetah).  They also encounter a bevy of interesting people along the way.  At Princeton, Harold runs into an Asian girl who has a crush on him named Cindy Kim (Siu Ta), who refers to him as a "Twinkie" (yellow on the outside, white on the inside).  Meanwhile, Kumar meets a "business hippie" (Dov Tiefenbach) and two very hot girls who make a game out... well I'll let you find out.  They meet Freakshow (Christopher Meloni), a hideous mechanic who says that, while he fixes their car, Harold and Kumar are welcome to sleep with his supermodel wife.  There are a group of racist bullies as well as racist cops, Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser, I mean himself) and finally, Harold's love interest, Maria Quesa Dilla (Paula Garc&eacute;s).<br /><br />One of the great intellectual points lies in the title and plot: why are they going to White Castle of all places?  It contains the word white.  Even though the pair are ethnic, and are often attacked for their minority status, they are white inside.  They live in the American melting pot, and they are no different from the people who give them a hard time.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, this movie is actually very entertaining.  If gross-out humor isn't your thing, you should avoid it, otherwise, go for it.  It's extreme dude!!!</p></body></html>

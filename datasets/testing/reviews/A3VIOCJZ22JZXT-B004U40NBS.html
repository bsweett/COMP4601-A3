The film is brilliant and was able to have me feeling extreme sympathy for an unprepared young woman one minute and then to be jumping out of my seat at her dark hallucinations and then feeling mystified as to how much of what we are seeing is reality and how much is in the mind of our poor deranged young ballerina. Any film that keeps me bouncing back and forth between reality and hallucination for two hours without becoming trite is certainly well made and strategized.<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky does an exceptional job with this psychological thriller that reminded me of the breakdown experienced by the surgeon played by Jeremy Irons in Dead Ringers. Natalie Portman is beyond exceptional as she plays Nina, a ballerina who has exceptional skills but who has been infantilized for so long by her overbearing mother, played by Barbara Hersey, that she has no survival skills. This is actually a key to understanding the film for a young woman who lives in a completely controlled world of stuffed animals and princess bedspreads is not prepared for the pressures of competition or for stretching herself artistically to achieve expressive goals. It is the ability to play both the White and Black swans that the artistic director, played by Vincent Cassel, is challenging Nina to achieve. Competition, especially from an attractive unorthodox dancer Lily, played by Mila Kunis, is too much for Nina to navigate. As Nina decompensates and becomes increasingly obsessive and compulsive, she has considerable struggles to control the darker side of her nature that she is allowing to emerge to portray the Black Swan. Portman is brilliant as she sways from reality to hallucination and from one dark influence to another.<br /><br />There is a final reason I was highly impressed with this film. Darren Aronofsky decided to use much of the music from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake as background music throughout non-ballet scenes. The music is full of suspense and tension and it was brilliant to use so much of the original ballet score throughout the film. Overall , this film gets an A+.</p></body></html>

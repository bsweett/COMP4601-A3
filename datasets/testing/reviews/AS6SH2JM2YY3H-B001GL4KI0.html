<meta name="summary" content="Exciting without being gory; unique battle scenes; Ultraviolet is one cool customer!"></head><body><p>Milla Jovovich is Ultraviolet, a "hemophage" infected human who is stronger and faster than everybody else, including other Hemophages (those infected with the hemophage virus).  A government official is charged with eliminating her kind from the face of the Earth, and he is most successful.<br /><br />There are extraordinary scenes in this movie, including the gravity-defying motorcycle chase, the internally stored weapons, and the use of exploding glass-like "shields" instead of blood to signify the destruction of a human guard/soldier.<br /><br />I watched the "Unrated, Extended Cut," and there was nothing I could see (not having seen the original) that would make me think that the rating was spooky (using the formula, "unrated" = more body parts or uncovered bodies).<br /><br />Like in the film it is often compared to (Aeon Flux), the story line took a while to understand.  Understanding that science fiction allows for violations of physical laws, what I really didn't understand was why these Hemophages had technologies so far beyond the humans, and the humans didn't even seem to be interested in obtaining these technologies (for example, the gravity defying feats).<br /><br />All in all, Ultraviolet was much more entertaining than I had expected from the poor reviews I had read in the newspaper.  You gotta love the genre...</p></body></html>

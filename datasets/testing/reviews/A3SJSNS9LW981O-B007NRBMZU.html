<meta name="summary" content="Intriguing, dark, but good ending"></head><body><p>After reading the viewer reviews about this movie, I'm convinced that those attracted to despair, futility, and ruination have a love affair with this adventure. Pedaphiles, doggie killers, baby bombers... it's all a bit much! Some complained about the perceived "upbeat" end of the film, although I didn't see the ending as upbeat at all.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert... Having the main character sacrifice the one relationship that meant the most to him...his true love, his childhood sweetheart... this is "upbeat?" Instead, it's bittersweet... he realizes that her life would be better if she wasn't close to him. Thus, this "good" ending has a sad twist, especially when he sees his true love on the street, but forces himself to keep walking away from her.<br /><br />If the ending had him "reconnect" with his lost love, that would had been inconsistent with the rest of the film. But the sacrifice of this time traveling protagonist, as kept in the film, fits well.<br /><br />The Director's cut has Kutcher's character strangle himself as a fetus? Please! I thought "Twelve Monkeys" was a depressing time travel film. If they kept this ending, Prozac could had officially sponsored the plunge into despair.</p></body></html>

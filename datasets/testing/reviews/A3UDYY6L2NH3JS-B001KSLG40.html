<meta name="summary" content="Not easy to be alive when Venus is radiating life into death"></head><body><p>A classic that will have many babies. The situation is simple and we all know it : a few normal people attacked by recently not yet buried corpses that have been revived in the brain. Living dead in a word. But this classic goes beyond this simple anecdote. It tries to explain - a sign that we are before the horror wave that will come soon - the phenomenon with some kind of radiation from Venus. But the main interest is the study of the reactions of people in front of such a situation. Fear of course. Self-protection and survival even if you have to kill your next door neighbor. Absolute egotism. Among them a black man who has some natural authority but who will have to kill all his fellow survivors because either they turn against him out of fear or they turn into living dead after having been killed in a way or another. The second interest is the organization society puts up to solve the crisis : a general posse that can ? kill ? (but how can we kill living dead who are already dead ?) at will and to the finish. And the finish will be to kill a live man because there is little difference between a living dead and a live man when both are on the other side, in front of your gunbarrel, and irony of irony, ..., but you have to see it. The moral of the story is that humanity is not very brilliant when it is confronted with a crisis in their own midst, coming from inside their ring.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

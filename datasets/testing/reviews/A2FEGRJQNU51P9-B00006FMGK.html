I've seen about half of the movies, and used to watch Deep Space Nine and an occasional episode of Voyager.  But, when a Star Trek movie comes out, there is enough interest in me to want to give it a chance.  So, when Nemesis came out on DVD I rented it and gave it a spin.  I was disappointed.<p>Near the beginning of the movie there is an attack on the Romulan Senate killing everyone.  We shift to the crew of the Enterprise where Riker (Jonathon Frakes) is getting married to Troi (Marina Sirtis).  Picard (Patrick Stewart) gives a nice best man speech.  When this is concluded and everyone is back on the Enterprise, Picard gets a message from Captain Janeway (from Star Trek Voyager) to engage in a diplomatic mission to Romulan.  On the way to Romulan they discover an odd signal coming from another planet and the Enterprise stops to investigate.  The signal is a disassembled android that appears to be an earlier version of Data (Brent Spiner) named B-4 (clever, yes?).  The Enterprise continues on to Romulan and upon arrival they learn that the situation has changed.  There is a new power, and it stems from a Remen uprising.  The new power is a man named Shinzon (Tom Hardy).  He is a human (not Remen), but was raised among the Remens.  He is also a clone of Picard.  <p>This throws all sorts of possibilities for the rest of the film, and the diplomatic mission has changed completely because of the new circumstances.  There are scenes of action and some of fairly good.  Some parts of the movie were interesting, but as a whole it felt like the movie failed on some level.  As I said, I'm not a Trekkie, so I can't speak for how the movie fits into the larger picture of the Star Trek universe, but as a movie Nemesis just wasn't that good.  I wish that I could give more of a positive review, but the movie was not that interesting or compelling.  I cannot recommend Star Trek: Nemesis.  If you are a fan of Star Trek and absolutely must see everything with the Star Trek name on it, then rent with with no expectations and you might be pleased.  If you are only looking for a decent science fiction movie, look elsewhere.  The quality is not here.</p></body></html>

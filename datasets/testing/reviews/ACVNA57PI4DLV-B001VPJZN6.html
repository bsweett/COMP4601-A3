<meta name="summary" content="Prequel definitively better than the sequel"></head><body><p>If sequels are traditionally worst than the original, prequels are less obvious. While Star Wars seems to show that they can be as terrible, a comparaison between Hannibal and Red Dragon is definitively a point in favour of prequels. <p>In Red Dragon, Hannibal says "a rational society would have killed me, or put me to some use". This is not only an interesting sentiment, but also a reflection of his character in movies - either stop using his character, or put him to some use. The movie Hannibal didn't get that. Red Dragon does, and that's one of the things it gets right. <p>Another thing it gets right is serial killers - or in this case, one serial killer, Red Dragon, who has killed two families and will kill more unless Agent Graham, the man who got Hannibal in prison (as told during the delicious opening scenes), gets on the case. Having established a patient-doctor relationship with Hannibal, who is a top-rate psychologist, Graham appeals to him again to help him solve this case. But Hannibal has an agenda of his own as well. <p>Red Dragon is trying a bit too hard to psych people. It has a number of false alerts (as well as an ending which serves absolutely no purpose) and a trivial character (the reporter, who serves as little more than foil). It could have been more, but as a portrayal of serial killers, Hannibal Lector, and interesting mysteries, it's right on the dot.</p></body></html>

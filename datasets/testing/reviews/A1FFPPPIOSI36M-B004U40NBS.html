<meta name="summary" content="What's the big deal?"></head><body><p>From my neanderthal pespective, I attentively watched this movie and felt "much ado about nothing".<br /><br />I was expecting more because of the ridiculous hype of this movie. What I have learned is that intense director, Darren Aronofsky, makes little, indie-resembling personal movies and then they get widespread acclaim ( I also thought "The Wrestler" was overrated). This was a passable piece of eccentric entertainment yet the premise of the story was not that compelling. The simple premise can almost be adapted into a play.<br /><br />Natalie Portman plays a [way over dedicated] ballerina where she has the talent to portray the angelic aspect of the role in "Swan Lake" but is missing the "soul" to play the emotional aspect of the role. Her overbearing mother, Barbera Hershey completely embarrassing herself playing a modern day Piper Laurie's charactor from "Carrie", developing rival, Mila Kunis, and passionate/perverted director all pull on her as she unravels.<br /><br />Portman's performance is interesting...if I was a 12 year old girl. The interaction is too catty for a viewer that doesn't understand the nuances of ballet to have empathy towards what is going on. This in ot only a "chick" flick but a "chick flick" for a drama queen.</p></body></html>

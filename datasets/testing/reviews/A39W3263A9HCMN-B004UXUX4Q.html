<meta name="summary" content="Honestly, it's mind blowing how overrated this movie is"></head><body><p>Look guys, I did get the movie...it's just, I didn't like it. Alright, I'm not sure if I'm putting it the right way. I liked lots about it, but I also disliked lots about it.<br /><br />Actually, I'm not sure if "lots" is the right word either. This is one maddening film.<br /><br />First off, I am more then familiar than Alex Payne. After all he did do my favourite movie of 2005, Sideways. However I absolutely hated About Schmidt. I thought it was boring tripe, but I decided to put that aside and watch it on the strength of Sideways alone. And boy, was I dead wrong.<br /><br />The film follows a real estate agent in Hawaii, Matt King, whose wife has ended up in a bad accident that has thrust her into a near death state. With the tragedy affecting his already broken family, he reunites with his bitchy teenage daughter, who spends the movie with some douchebag I couldn't for the life of me care about. She reveals that his wife had an affair with a rival agent of his, which leads him to seek him out to confront him face to face, and seal the deal on a piece of land he owns.<br /><br />First off, I liked Clooney. He was the film, and without him I would have been bored outright. He's the one thing keeping it watchable. Oh, and it was shot beautifully too.<br /><br />But... The film just bored me.<br /><br />First off, it's SO PREDICTABLE. I predicted the whole thing with the land and how Matt would decide he wanted to keep the land instead of selling it. I predicted how he'd fall for Speer's wife. I predicted that Speer had a wife and kids too. Seriously, how did you not see it coming?<br /><br />The characters were boring as hell. The only memorable one was Beau Bridges and he was only in the film for 6 minutes. Speer was so clich&eacute;d in terms of development.<br /><br />Oh, and worst of all- it was so full of clich&eacute;s. You can tell how it's going to end from the opening scene, and you can essentially think to yourself "I think this is going to happen" and -gasp- it does!<br /><br />But, it is prettily shot. I guess that's all that's needed to constitute Oscar bait nowadays. This isn't a bad film but it has every right to be, and the fact that it is up against The Artist for best picture is just laughable, because The Artist really does deserve the award. Don't kid yourself. This film is really forgettable.</p></body></html>

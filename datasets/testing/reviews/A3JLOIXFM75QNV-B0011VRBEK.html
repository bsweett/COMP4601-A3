<meta name="summary" content="A twisted tale of revenge"></head><body><p>To describe any part of this film would be to ruin it, so I will only say that it is not something that you see every day. This is not your average and straightforward tale of revenge. It is brutal, shocking and so twisted, that it would certainly turn some people off if they knew what they were getting in to.<br /><br />I suppose what I can say is it revolves around a man, who without warning or explanation, is held prisoner for 12 years and just as suddenly-he is let go. From then he has 5 days to find out why this happened to him. That is all you need to know.<br /><br />Visually, the film looks very cool. It is bold in color, sometimes grainy and always interesting. I found the subtitles easy to follow, which I was glad of as some films, it just goes by way too quickly. The plot was easy enough to follow, even though you really don't know much of what is going on. Only in those last tense minutes do you get the sense of what you are witnessing.<br /><br />Though I liked this film very much, looking back, I have to say that the plot is almost too elaborate for the big reveal ending. I can't go into depth here since I don't wish to spoil anything, but after I finished viewing it, I just thought that it just seemed a bit over the top. Also, I have no idea why this is sometimes labeled as a horror film- it is not. It is very adult however, with plently of violence and sexual content. I found this to be more of a drama than anything, especially after the end. People will have varying opinions regarding this film, though if you have an open mind and like a great mystery, you may enjoy Oldboy.</p></body></html>

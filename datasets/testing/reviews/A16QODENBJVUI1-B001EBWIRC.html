<meta name="summary" content="Gets better with each viewing - A great, great classic"></head><body><p>The mark of a truly great film is that it not only holds up with each reviewing, but actually gets better and more impressive.  While it is always exhilarating to enjoy the plot the first time through, once you know what is going to happen, you get to focus on other, smaller things that may have escaped you before.  For instance, notice that each scene begins with either a camera or a character in motion.  You don't just get a cut to the inside of a room, but a cut to a character entering a room.  This gives the film as a whole a very active, energetic feel, as if the whole picture were alive.  It puts you, the viewer, in the middle of the action, instead of merely passively sitting back and watching the scenes unfold before you.  Subtleties like this help make this one of the truly great films Hollywood produced.<p>Humphrey Bogart was not an A-list actor when this film came out.  He was afterwards.  Earlier in 1941 he had surprised Hollywood by excelling in a lead role in HIGH SIERRA, so his success in THE MALTESE FALCON was not a complete surprise.  From this point onwards, Warners and other studios always were on the lookout for the next film for him to star in.  Before, he got roles by default.  Note:  many think he got the lead in CASABLANCA by default, but in fact Warners had him cast in the role from the beginning, but spread some false information about who was to star in it (e.g., Ronald Reagan) in order to build suspense as to who would star.  But CASABLANCA was intended as a Bogart vehicle from the start, thanks to THE MALTESE FALCON.<p>Apart from the magnificent direction by John Huston (shown in such details as the active camera mentioned above), there are two major reasons this film succeeds so well.  First, many point to this film as one of the very few that is as good as the novel upon which it is based.  The reason for this in this case is the fact that John Huston stuck as close to the novel as was possible in Hays Office Hollywood (i.e., he had to tone certain things down to pass the Code, like Joel Cairo's homosexuality, which was far more commented upon in the novel).  Most of the best scenes are taken word-for-word from the novel, such as the "Fat Man's" great conversation with Sam Spade.  Dashiell Hammett had a genius for hard-hitting dialog, and Huston wisely decided to leave it alone.  Huston was brilliant at transparently adapting Hammett's novel with as little tinkering as possible.<p>The third great reason for the film's success is the virtually perfect cast.  Although Bogart wasn't the first choice for the film, it is now impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  The movie, in fact, made stars of many of the principles involved.  Mary Astor had her career revived, Sydney Greenstreet immediately became one of the leading character actors in Hollywood, Elisha Wood Jr. became a familiar face in film, and Peter Lorre, who had made a long string of films in England and the US (including the Mr. Moto movies) since leaving Germany upon the Nazis rise to power, became a much more prominent figure in American film.  Huston himself was one of the more prominent directors in Hollywood for the rest of his career, thanks to his great success in this, his first film.<p>A final note:  the film is remarkable for its cinematography, and is rightfully considered one of the first film noirs for its use of light and shadow.  Interestingly, the person in charge of photography, Arthur Edeson, had been the cinematographer on the 1936 William Dieterle's SATAN MET A LADY, the second film version of Hammett's novel, the film (Huston's being the third).  I'm not aware if his previous experience added to the quality of the film, but it is a fascinating coincidence.</p></body></html>

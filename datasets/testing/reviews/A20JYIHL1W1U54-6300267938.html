<meta name="summary" content="Real Cowboys"></head><body><p>In THE COWBOYS John Wayne as Wil Andersen has to resort to using boys to mount his cattle drive. He takes these boys and makes men out of them and then cowboys. This is an interesting film and goes against John Wayne's somewhat stereotypical and programmer type films he was making near the end of his career. Wayne plays this rancher convincingly. The premise of the story is intriguing and its outcome takes several twists before its conclusion. The intervention of Bruce Dern as a very evil villain on cattle drive and his demise is shocking. These boys learn about being men but perhaps learn a cruel lesson along the way. John William's rousing score is a highlight.</p></body></html>

Forty years ago, in 1966, a 16-year-old girl disappeared without a trace from a large, wealthy Swedish family. A recently-disgraced journalist (Daniel Craig) is approached by the girl's uncle (Christopher Plummer) to look into the case. The case is complex because though the girl's relatives all live on a small island, some are reclusive ex-Nazis and the rest are not talking to each other. Meanwhile, back in the city, Lisbeth Salander -- a young  punk girl, tattooed and pierced -- is undergoing her own difficulties with the social welfare system. She is anti-social, lesbian and tough, but a heck of a hacker and researcher. The movie takes off when she (played by an Oscar-worthy Rooney Mara) and Craig team up to crack the case.<br /><br />The film is dark, edgy and very rough. Shot in monochromes, it exudes a sense of cold and isolation that matches the spirit of its characters. The plot contains very frank depictions of sexual abuse and rape, and the dialog is rough as well. This makes the characters, especially Lisbeth's, very real and multi-faceted. Lisbeth is one of the darkest heroines to emerge from a fiction writer's pen. She is small and fragile, with nearly translucent skin and an air of fatalism. Yet she is strong and resourceful, capable of outwitting her victimizers with a (perhaps) put-on madness that nears psychotic levels. Not a young lady to be tampered with.<br /><br />Great film, even if the Plummers and Craigs can't match Mara's soul-seared intensity.</p></body></html>

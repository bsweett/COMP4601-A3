These events are seen through the eyes of Judah Ben-Hur, the title character whose interaction with the unrest and confusion of these times becomes a sumptuous and highly emotional human drama from which I was unable to hold back tears. The movie's grand scale and moving storytelling, under the superb direction of William Wyler, are just the icing on this multi-faceted an breathtaking view of the time of Jesus. <p>Our main character, Judah Ben-Hur, is deeply unsettled by the intent of the Romans to take over the small town of Judea and convert its Jewish citizens into Roman citizens, which would mean their swearing of allegiance and worship to the Emporer of Rome. His unrest is further complicated by his friendship with the tribune of the Roman Army, Messala, whom he has known since childhood. Messala hopes he can rely on Judah's support, and that his friend's influence will make for an easier transition, while the armies of the Roman empire begin filling up the city. <p>Through sheer fate, an accident involving Judah and the new governor lands he and his family, his mother Mirriam and sister Tirzah, in the Roman prison, where Messala, who was earlier spurned by Judah in his request for support, sentences Judah to the galleys, with fates unknown for his family. Judah is forced to leave behind his family, his home, and a budding romance with his former servant Hester, with whom he visited before his arrest. His experiences in the galleys will lead him to become the adopted son of a council, a formidable rival against his nemesis in a grueling chariot race, and a strong and bold man whose devotion to his family and his love for Esther will drive him to survive any situation. <p>The fictional aspect of this story is set against the life of Christ, which begins the movie in a glorious opening depicting His birth. We are given a small glimpse of the Three Wisemen, who will appear later in the film to interact with Judah in his return to Judea. Judah will also come to see Christ face-to-face on numerous occasions, providing us a small glimpse of the power He held over people and the good deeds he gave unto them. On a small side note, I particularly liked the way in which Christ's is never seen, adding an air of mystery to a man whose life is enshrouded in it. <p>The history and the fiction never outweigh one another, but instead have a special way of working with one another so that we become enamored by both. Judah's experiences with Christ will further lead to his will to survive, and his segue from hardened feelings of hatred for his enemies to love for all those around him. The inevitable crucifiction, which comes in the last half hour, is a mesmerizing experience which will show the death of Christ as well as the cleansing of the world's impurities through the healing of Judah's mother and sister, who were stricken with leprocy while in prison. And the Roman empire is seen a magnificent light, especially once Judah is accepted into their circles when he saves the council's life. <p>Human depth and emotion is also very important to this epic, and it achieves this aspect in every way possible. The relationship between Judah and his family is intensified by his fight to survive in hopes that he might, one day, be able to free them again. Once stricken with the shamed disease, the two women decide never to see him again, allowing him to think them dead. Their decision is utterly gutwrenching, so don't try holding back tears. The romance between Judah and Esther shows not only their love but their hardships and troubles, which makes it all the more convincing and enticing to watch. The interaction between Judah and Messala is intense and provides much of the movie's conflicts, and we must question why Messala would do such things to an old friend. We can relate to these characters on many levels, which allows us to identify with the movie itself. <p>Director William Wyler sought out to make an epic out of this story, and his success in achieving this goal is spectacular and marvelous to look at. The movie's 300 grand and ominous set designs contribute to the vast and perplexing beauty of this period in time, while luxurious costumes, which were reported to be in excess of over 100,000 outfits for 8,000 extras, are meticulous and exact in detail and authenticity. The need for action is also present, which is met with a splendid sequence aboard a Roman sea vessel, which leads to a water battle, and the ever-popular chariot race which set a new standard in movie special effects in its day. To this day, this scene is intense and overflows with suspense, even when watched more than once. Music is also important, overflowing with sadness and uplifting chords which all sweep us into the movie's high-level emotion. <p>The cast is extremely likeable and easy on the eyes, while giving us performances that breach the limits of human depth. Charlton Heston, who played Moses in another Biblical epic, really outdoes himself here with this role, bringing out all of Judah Ben-Hur's emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. Here is a very complex character whose interactions with his surroundings change his life in new and unforeseen ways, perhaps the most complex movie character in history. His nemesis, Messala, is played masterfully by Stephen Boyd, who makes Messala a perfectly crafty, pompous and deceptive enemy to match Judah. Esther is portrayed by Haya Harareet, who is subtly enticing, allowing her deep wisdom and powerful insight into Judah's actions and mind to shine through her intense physical beauty. Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell are Mirriam and Tirzah, on whom a major portion of the emotional depth relies on. Their performances are extremely moving and deep, as is the rest of this fabulous ensemble cast. <p>Being one of the most incredible epics ever put to the screen, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; defies all the obstacles and comes out unflawed. The story has everything going for it, and it meets all its goals through its dramatic storytelling, its powerhouse performances and epic scale and grandeur. I love movies like this, which continue to impress after multiple viewings, while also reaching for the heart and giving it a nice emotional tug. Judah is a hero for the ages, embodying everything we want in a character whose survival we wish for.</p></body></html>

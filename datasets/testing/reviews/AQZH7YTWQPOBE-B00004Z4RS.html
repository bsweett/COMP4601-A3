<meta name="summary" content="Comic book movie done right"></head><body><p>I was never a fan of the X-Men comic books, but X-Men is probably the best action hero/comic book movie out there. Unlike many other such movies, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICLRIO">Fantastic Four [Blu-ray</a>], which are simply an excuse to have a bunch of action scenes and special effects, X-Men actually has a well-developed plot, good acting, as well as impressive special effects. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan as the two main mutants make the movie, are fantastic add emotional depth, but X-Men also includes a strong supporting cast, including Hugh Jackman and Hallie Berri. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by X-Men. Definitely worth checking out, even if you're not usually into this type of movie.</p></body></html>

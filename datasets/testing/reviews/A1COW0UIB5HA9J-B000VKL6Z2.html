<meta name="summary" content="A nice revamp of the John Carpenter classic!"></head><body><p>Sixteen years ago, a young boy named Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) has a dysfunctional family. His stepfather Ronnie (William Forsythe) is a drunk redneck who kind of abuses the young boy, he has a sexy stripper mother Debroah (Sherri Moon Zombie), a stepsister named Judith (Hanna Hall) and a baby sister named Laurie. He has gotten into rotten and horrific behaviors including killing animals and even killed a few school bullies that picked on him, he did however murdered his big sister with her boyfriend and Ronnie creating one of Haddonfield's most brutal crimes ever. He is convicted guilty of murder in the first degree and is under psychiatric care with daily care from child psychologist Dr. Sam Loomis (Michael Mcdowell), years later as he has grown up as a hulking mute man (Tyler Mane) Michael hides his face in various masks. He escapes from the mental ward to find his long lost little sister Laurie Strode (Scout-Taylor Compton) as he kills people in his way for now Dr. Loomis must try to stop him from killing anyone.<br /><br />Enjoyable revamp of the Halloween franchise that started with the 1978 slasher landmark from John Carpenter. Fans cried blasphemy when they heard this was gonna be remade but Rob Zombie who is a hardcore fan of the original and whom helmed the underrated "House of 1000 Corpses" and the brilliant "Devil's Rejects" went to save the franchise after it became a joke of itself no thanks to "Halloween Resurrection" with Busta Rhymes ruining the film. Although he had no intention to make a full remake like the horrible "Psycho" remake from 1998 he wanted to make a prequel and a reinvention of the original movie that honors John Carpenter's masterpiece. The film does co-star Ken Foree, Sid Haig, Brad Douriff, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Danielle Harris, Dee Wallace Stone, Clint Howard, Udo Kier, and Sybil Danning as this film does give an interesting extended history of Michael Myers and how he had a dysfunctional family. I know some fans of the original Halloween are kind of disgusted with the new Myers being a "Married with Children" kind of trashy family. There is some brutal gory violence making this the goriest Halloween movie since "Halloween 2" in 1981, though it does miss out on the original bloodless scares that made the original movie a classic this one goes for bloody action like some of the Halloween sequels. Though it is very entertaining but can never replace the original classic as that was not the intention that Rob Zombie did for he just wanted to re-establish the franchise.<br /><br />This 2-Disc collector's Edition blu-ray offers stunning picture and sound with the unrated director's cut of the film with more character development and violence that were cut out to avoid an NC-17 rating. The extras include Audio commentary, a 2 hour documentary that goes behind the scenes of this reimagining, featurettes, deleted scenes and alternate ending with select commentary, Screen tests, interviews, BD-Live and Trailer.</p></body></html>

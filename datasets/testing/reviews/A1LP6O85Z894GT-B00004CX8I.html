<meta name="summary" content="My favorite film of all time"></head><body><p>This is my favorite movie of all time. I'm not saying it is the greatest ever made- there are many more titles that could easily vie for that title. Unlike many other classic works of cinematic art, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST doesn't break ground in its camera work or composition. There are very few memorable shots visually or technically speaking. However, director Forman knows what to do: he gets out of the way and lets his actors tell the captivating story filled with sacrifice and rough grace. The story's universal theme of the individual courageously fighting for identity against "the machine" inspires while entertaining. A feat few contemporary movies successfully pull off. <p>CUCKOO'S NEST is an actor's movie. The ensemble work here by Nicholson, Fletcher, Lloyd, Redfield, Lassick, Sampson, Devito and the rest is among the finest ever captured. Not a false note plays in any of the performances. These actors fully inhabit the skins of these characters and therefore, create three dimensional people that connect spiritually and fully to the audience's empathy.<p>The script is air tight as it oscillates between comedy and tragedy. This occurs often not only in the same scene but in the same take. The film compliments the novel nicely (but exist in completely different spheres), although much of the books surreal symbolism is lost in favor of a clear linear narrative. The film also shifts the point of view from Chief's (in the novel) to McMurphy.  Many of my favorite lines in film history are in this movie. "Least I tried, G*******t, least I did that!" is a motto that has guided my life.<p>When viewed with its near twin COOL HAND LUKE (my third favorite film of all time), one can see the possibly dated, but no less intriguing subtext of the criminal/prisoner as savior. Many souls are saved as a direct result of McMurphy's (and Luke's) ultimate sacrifice.<p>The film is entertaining, enlightening and reflective without the slightest hint of pretension.<p>A brief note about this special edition two disc DVD: the behind the scenes material only briefly mentions author Ken Kesey. There is no footage of him weighing in with his experiences writing the original novel. This is criminal.  I know the late Kesey disowned this film and I don't blame him considering the experience he had. However the producers and screenwriter virtually ignore the brilliant Oregonian who wrote one of America's greatest novels.<br /><br />With each viewing (I've seen the film probably 30+ times) it appears as fresh and beautiful as the first. A definite 10 out of 10 must own contemporary classic.</p></body></html>

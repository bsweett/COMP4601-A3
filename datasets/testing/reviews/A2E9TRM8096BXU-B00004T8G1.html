<meta name="summary" content="Beware the Fog...literally."></head><body><p>"The Fog" is a fairly typical representative of a John Carpenter movie. It certainly has its moments, yet it leaves the viewer with an unmistakable feeling of "what might have been." In this sense it reminds me a bit of Michael Mann's 1985 version of F. Paul Wilson's "The Keep", another fascinating yet flawed horror movie which I watch over and over again in the vain hopes of discovering that it is actually good.<br /><br />Stripped to the bone, "The Fog" is the story of a small New England fishing town which is about to celebrate its centennial (or bicentennial....or anniversary of some type). On the eve of this occasion the local priest, a drunken sot played by Hal Holbrook, discovers that the town - like all horror movie small towns - has a terrible secret linked to its founding. This discovery coincides with the appearance of a nasty fog off the coast which tends to leave dead people in its wake, and is moving towards the town. Various characters in the town, including a local beer-guzzler (Tom Atkins) a nubile hitch-hiker (Jamie Lee Curtis) a radio deejay (Adrienne Barbeau) and so on, are all isolated by the fog and soon discover what is inside it, and how it is related to the "terrible secret", an old sin for which the modern-day townsfolk mist pay.<br /><br />As you can see, while the idea is not exactly new it is pretty cool, and when I popped "The Fog" into my ancient DVD player recently I did so after a hiatus of many years, with the hope that my earlier judgement on the film was wrong. In this I was disappointed. Like "The Keep", "The Fog" never gets any better; unlike "The Keep" it actually gets worse.<br /><br />On paper this should not have happened. Besides Carpenter, who was coming off well-received efforts like "Assault on Precinct 13" and "Halloween" there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original "Halloween" crew. Besides Carptenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, there is also the girl who played Annie (Michael's first onscreen victim), as well as the guy who played the Sheriff in both H and H-2. Replacing the ubiquitous Donald Pleasance is Hal Halbrook, and the venerable John Houseman makes an appearance in the film's opening as a creepy, storytellin' sea captain. Even Janet Leigh is involved, as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a Fog victim. Ironically, tis is part of the film's problem, and it has many.<br /><br />First off, there are far too many characters. The film is cluttered with them and for some reason Carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses. Most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot, and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end. We needed more killings, not less.<br /><br />Second, the performances. This movie has good actors, but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid. The worst of it is ladeled onto Adrienne Barbeau, who gets to repeat idiocies like, "My son is trapped! Trapped by the fog!" and "Look out, into the darkness....and beware of the fog!" Gag.<br /><br />Third, the villain(s). Carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film, but he never delivers on it: there is no real payoff. This is because he couldn't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was IN the fog was the actual "baddie" of the film. The result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges. "The Fog" might as well be a run o' the mill flood - faceless and impersonal.<br /><br />The movie does have its moments -- the creepy opening, the moments of atmospheric horror at sea, and the excellent cinematography, which is used to particular effect on the creepy fog-dwellers. But in the end these fail to outweigh the movie's many flaws.<br /><br />As of today, I still regard Carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there. On the one hand he gave us P-13, Halloween, Escape from New York, and The Thing, all classics (cult or otherwise). On the other hand he also gave us crap like Prince of Darkness and the unwatchable Ghosts of Mars. In between there are the fun but flawed outings like They Live and In the Mouth of Madness. I would like to say that The Fog falls in this last category, but I really can't. It just isn't very good, and that's the sad fact of it. Bottom line? Beware The Fog.</p></body></html>

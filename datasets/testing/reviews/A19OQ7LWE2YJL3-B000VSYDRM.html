Each image made me conjure in my mind the smell. What a completely original film. The main character made me feel sympathy and hate him at the same time. Rickman was outstanding portraying the feelings of a protective father demonstrating a love for his daughter that was painful to watch because he is so worried about what will happen to her. He did a wonderful job capturing the protectiveness, vulnerability, and strength of a loving father. The main actor, playing Henri, was outstanding.<br />I was surprised to see Dustin Hoffman as the italian perfumer. His accent was really bad and he kept pulling me out of the movie to Dustin Hoffman the way he'd go in and out of accent. His voice was distracting. Other than that he was good portraying the has-been perfumer, silly and desperate at the same time.<br />What a beautiful unique bit of film art. Not enough artistry is scene in film today, it's mostly about making millions of megabucks. But this movie was something that had you riveted from the opening scene in the fish market. Weird, but so well done, appreciated for its weirdness.  There was so much visual beauty. It had me wondering whose scent Henri loved the most, which girl, was it that first with the fruits?! Cool film. Also recommended: Black Snake Moan - another well-done film which can be appreciated for its artistry, acting, music, etc.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than the first one"></head><body><p>While it still retains many of the elements that continue to make of the series a children's classic, I liked the second installment more than the "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" movie. The beginning was a little repetitive in some ways (Harry's family, the train departure, etc.) but past that, the movie took on a life of its own and became very enjoyable, with a whole plot woven around the existence of a terrible hidden Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts. Some elements I found to be rather interesting were the uninvited house-elf (Dobby) and Dumbledore's beautiful Phoenix bird. Obviously deserved praise for the ingenious characters and their surroundings belongs to J.K. Rawling, the author of the books, but the movie in itself is capable to deliver a whole world of effects that blend very well into the brilliant story. With Mexican-born Alfonso Cuaron directing the next installment, the Potter movies promise to only get better with time, quite an accomplishment for sequels.</p></body></html>

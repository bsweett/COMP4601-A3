Ironic, because the lead role of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a hired gun.  He travels for 322 days a year firing people on behalf of downsizing companies.<br /><br />Clooney is wonderful in this role.  He is cool, calm and manages to remain detached from the raw emotions that can be provoked as part of the process of "letting people go".  Yet, for all his skill, he is marked for downsizing himself as a young woman in the office develops the idea of firing people online.  Instantly, travel and associated costs are eliminated.  But, so too is Bingham's very life style.  He lives for the life on the road and its privileges and anonymity.  He dreads having to return to his "home town" of Omaha.  Here, he keeps only a very modest apartment.  After all, nine days in ten sees him travelling.<br /><br />In his travels, Bingham comes across Alex (Vera Farmiga) who seems in a strange way to be his soul mate.  Ah, but there is more than meets the eye with Alex.  She has her own secrets which, in due course, are stumbled upon by Bingham.<br /><br />"Up in the Air" is a surprisingly good film.  It is deeper that I might have thought.  It is also funny and touching.  Perhaps George Clooney has been type cast.  This is a shame.  He is a very good actor and this role suits him admirably.</p></body></html>

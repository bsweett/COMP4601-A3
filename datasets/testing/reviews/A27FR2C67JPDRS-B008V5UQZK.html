This is the best romantic comedy I've seen in a good while.  The story centers around a young woman (played very sweetly by Nia Vardalos) who meets Mr. Right after making a change in her plain and uneventful life.  The chance she takes pays off and she wins the heart of a handsome professor (John Corbett of "Northern Exposure and recently "Sex in the City) that leads to a wedding proposal.  A good majority of the film follows the couple as she introduces him to the her huge Greek clan and he to his rather sedated parents.  Lanie Kazan and Michael Constantine are superb as her parents and Andrea Martin, as Aunt Voula, is a riot.  The chemistry between Vardalos and Corbett is real and very touching.  The crowd I saw the movie with was as obviously as tickled as I was...we laughed ALL the way through!  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  I guarantee you'll love it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Subtlety is the key..."></head><body><p>This film has all the essential qualities of a classic ghost story. It really comes down to the fact that if a ghost story is told well, it will scare you. ~The Others~ is extremely well made, each scene is crafted to ensure it evokes a particular mood or feeling in the most subtle ways. Director Alejandro Amenaber, (Open your Eyes) is a Spanish craftsman who has a gift for telling a story with subtlety, nothing is ever apparent, but is hinted at through the visuals and clues in the dialogue. Personally, the in-your-face horror stories do nothing for me. I find Eddie Krugger, for example, hilarious. What is horrifying, for me, is subtle irrational behaviour. Grace (Nicole Kidman) at the opening of the film instructs the servants to ensure they close and lock every door in the house as they move through them. As she believes the sunlight is dangerous to her two children, she is absolutely adamant that the light must be contained. Suddenly our normal sensibilities are reversed, the light is the enemy and the darkness must be secured at any cost. I find this sort of thing more disturbing than 'Jason' rising from the depths and decapitating a few unlucky teenagers. Subtlety is the key for a good ghost story.<p>Nicole Kidman is a versatile actor who possesses a huge range. She has shown that she can play just about any character and play it with believability. In this film her neurotic behaviour is honest to the point of irritability. She is also an attractive and elegant woman and a pleasure to view on the big screen. Her performance in this film is quite good, but Fionnula Flanagan as the head housekeeper stole the show. Her expressions throughout the film would constantly put me off balance - the characters intentions are never clear until the end. She plays a veneer of kindness with a hint of evil bubbling just under the surface. Again, this was a subtle performance which created a huge impact. In fact, all the performances from the cast, particularly the children, were first rate.<p>This is a good film to have in your collection because it can be seen more than once, as there are subtle aspects in the story that will be missed on a single viewing. The mark of a good ghost story or any tale is its light touch and unexpected twist. This film has both.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sport Films' Move Into the Twenty-First Century"></head><body><p>I really fell in love with this one. With the advent of instant global communication and the wealth of information that's available at the speed of thought today, the focus of our collective interest in sports has shifted and deepened. While the contests will always be the main focus, rightly, there's also a sweeping undercurrent of interest in the games behind the games. Player swaps, contract negotiations, deep statistical analysis; these are as formidable an arsenal for the modern team as a bat and glove, and it's about time Hollywood made the effort to examine that fundamental shift. Moneyball does it exceptionally well, delving into the theories and risks behind this new way of thinking without going too far into the realm of obsessive over-explanation. As the team's roster and strategies begin to change shape and coalesce, the film shifts into something larger than a mere underdog sports story, interpersonal drama or heady mathematical essay. It's all of those things and more, with an ambitiously large toolbox and the confident knowledge of how to most efficiently use each implement: an evolution of sports-themed material on film. It's the rare film that non-fans can enjoy just as much as season ticket holders, and a justified candidate for the Oscars' top honor.</p></body></html>

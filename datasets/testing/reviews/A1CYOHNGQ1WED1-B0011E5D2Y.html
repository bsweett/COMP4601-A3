<meta name="summary" content="A funny comedy for a change"></head><body><p>Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play friends and business partners that spend their summers crashing weddings so they can find an attractive female guest and sleep with them. They have characters and scenarios for themselves for each wedding and a long list of rules for how to properly crash a wedding and not get caught. Things change when they crash the wedding of one of the daughters of the secretary of the treasury played by Christopher Walken. Wilson falls hard for another daughter played by Rachel McAdams. Vaughn meanwhile slips away with yet another daughter, sleeps with her and then finds out too late that she's nuts. They get invited back to the family home for the weekend and accept because Wilson is trying to woo McAdams away from her lout of a fiancee.<br /><br />Wedding Crashers has some very funny scenes. Wilson and Vaughn work well together as friends and their interactions and banter at the weddings are fluid. The movie bogs down some with Wilson trying to win McAdams and everyone in the treasury secretary's family having a quirk to deal with. The ending also drags but overall this was a funny comedy.</p></body></html>

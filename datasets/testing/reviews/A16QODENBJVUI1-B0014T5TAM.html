<meta name="summary" content="A not quite perfect film with many perfect moments"></head><body><p>Warning!  Minor spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I'm going to attempt a relatively spoiler free review.  There are numerous minor and a couple of major twists in the film and I believe potential viewers would be best served by seeing this as ignorant as possible of what transpires.  I have not read Ian McEwan's novel (in fact, I very much regret that I have never read any of his novels, though he has long been on my "List," the ever-expanding titles of books that I intend to read at some point), so I can't say how closely the film does or does not hew to the book.<br /><br />This is not as a whole a great film, but it unquestionably has many extraordinary moments.  It certainly is a very ambitious film and while it doesn't always succeed in its ambitions, it does often enough to make seeing it an unforgettable experience.  The film begins very, very slowly and twenty-five minutes into it I found myself almost completely uninterested in what was happening.  There was also some confusion about precisely who various characters were.  This does gradually get straightened out and after the first half hour the film definitely picks up dramatically in pace.<br /><br />From beginning to end I had trouble with the erratic placement of scenes within the narrative.  We often see scenes acted out twice in a row from different perspectives.  Once we jump back several years with little context provided.  I'm sure this is meant to be very cinematic, but the decision not to be linear in the narrative is sometimes confusing, and I'm not sure that there is a huge pay off.  This, however, along with the slowness at the beginning of the film, are about the only negatives I have with the film.<br /><br />The positives for the film are numerous and significant.  This is an extraordinarily beautiful film.  From beginning to end every scene looks perfect.  Occasionally the beauty seems an end unto itself.  Take the astonishing long scene shot on what is supposed to be the Dunkirk beach.  This is a very long shot apparently done in a single shot that is absolutely epic in scope.  I'm pretty certain that it was not, in fact, done in a single take.  There were probably a couple of wipes that allowed them to splice different takes.  My reason for saying this is that the scene was just too complex and gargantuan for anyone to have accomplished it in a single take.  The very long take that begins Orson Welles's A TOUCH OF EVIL was under far more controlled and simple circumstances.  The final minutes of Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST was complex, but it also featured a couple of cuts.  There is a very long single-shot scene in Joss Whedon's SERENITY, but that scene is simplicity itself compared to the Dunkirk shot.  But here is my question:  does the Dunkirk scene, as glorious as it was, really achieve anything narratively?  It is just this gorgeous piece of bric-a-brac stuck in the middle of the film.  Mind you, I'm delighted that they put it in there.  It was a fascinating scene to watch.  But I'm not sure that it made ATONEMENT a better movie.  Contrast this with the very long single-shot scene from the end of CHILDREN OF MEN or the even longer car chase scene earlier in the same film, both of which made the movie much better and contributed to the overall tone of the film.<br /><br />The acting is marvelous and it could signal Keira Knightley moving to more adult roles and the beginning of a star career for James McAvoy.  I also loved many among the supporting cast.  All three of the actors playing Briony at various ages -- Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave -- were amazing.  But of the three, Ronan was perhaps the most astonishing.  I was not aware until afterward that she had received an Oscar nomination for her role as the 13-year-old Briony, but it was richly deserved.  I also learned that she is going to be starring in the Peter Jackson film THE LOVELY BONES as the young murdered girl who narrates the story (no spoiler there -- you learn it at the outset), which has tremendously increased my interest in the film.  And everyone in all the other supporting roles was equally as excellent.  My only regret was that Brenda Blethyn, who has to go on any short list of the world's greatest actors, had such a small role.<br /><br />All in all, while the film began very slowly and I think had some questionable issues surrounding narrative structure was all in all a remarkably good film.  If I were a member of the Academy it wouldn't get my vote for Best Picture, but it certainly has my respect.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="When good liberals go bad: "Death Wish" for the 21st century"></head><body><p>Jodie Foster's Erica Bain is the host of a smug, NPR-type radio program.  She lives in New York, which she bills as the "safest large city in the world."  After her boyfriend is killed and she is beaten almost to death while walking in the park at night (New York's still not *that* safe!), she and a new friend, Mr. Nine-millimeter,* embark on a voyage of self discovery, and together they explode the myth that it's only conservatives who love gunning down the bad guys.<br /><br />Like her predecessor Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey, Ms Bain's killing spree is tasteful and politically correct.  She kills a properly diverse group of thugs, pervs, wife-beaters and drug-runners.  Also like "Death Wish," we know our lead character is really a good person at heart, because of the emotional trauma she goes through after gunning down each criminal.  The Brave One is definitely a worthy update to the classic original.<br /><br />*  Ripped off from Pulp Fiction.</p></body></html>

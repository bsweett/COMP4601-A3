<meta name="summary" content="Robocop Jr."></head><body><p>I rented Iron Man on DVD yesterday, and I had a chance to check it out last night. I had high expectations for this film---I expected more, a lot more, a hell of a lot more. Okay, it was a summer movie. Critics raved so much over Iron Man that I couldn't wait to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />My first gripe against Iron Man was the time it took to get to the action: about 40 minutes. There was too much exposition before the actual fireworks, and those fireworks were over in a blink. My second gripe against Iron Man was its conflict: weapons save lives, and weapons take lives. I wasn't expecting a brain-f**k, but I was expecting something more sophisticated. My third gripe against Iron Man was Gwyneth Paltrow. She's out of this world, and I would like to have seen more of her.<br /><br />On the plus side, Robert Downey Jr. invests more personality in a superhero than I am used to seeing. He plays the cold arrogant billionaire role with ease. Downey plays billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who's the antithesis of everything heroic. Tony grew up as a child prodigy. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, he built his first engine. At age seventeen, he graduated from MIT. And as CEO of the largest and wealthiest defense contractor in the world, Tony Stark has zero morals. He gambles, he drinks, he's irresponsible, and he's a womanizer.<br /><br />Tony pitches a new missile system, the Jericho, to the military in Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. There, a band of terrorists hijack Tony's Humvee. The terrorists overwhelm Tony's military entourage. The confrontation is furious and swift. Hours later, Tony awakens in a dark cave. His body is wet with sweat and blood, his clothes are torn, and he has a huge plug--an electromagnet--protruding out of his chest. This magnet keeps him alive by pulling the shrapnel embedded his chest away from his heart. Earlier, during the terrorist siege, an exploding bomb splintered and planted those splinters in Tony's chest.<br /><br />The terrorists torture Tony; they dunk his head underwater. Then they show him why they kidnapped him in the first place. They lead him out of the dark cave and into the light. Tony sees an enormous cache of stockpiled weapons--weapons manufactured by his company. The terrorists stockpile these weapons to use against American soldiers. Now the terrorists want Tony's help: they want Tony to build the Jericho missile system for them to use against American soldiers. The terrorists promise to release Tony if he cooperates. But Tony has other ideas. He builds an armored battle-suit equipped with flame-throwers. He escapes.<br /><br />Back home in the U.S., the press mobs Tony. He's sober.  He saw terrorists use his weapons to kill American soldiers; now, he wants to shut down the weapons development division of his company. He wants to use his company to make the world a better place. Tony's plans embitter his guardian and vice president Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who has his sights set on selling the Jericho missile system to the U.S. government. The action starts from this point of the movie.<br /><br />Like Batman, Iron Man has no natural powers; this implies that some heroes are made. The exterior insulation of Tony Stark's vanity and ego are the perfect counterpoint to Iron Man's cold titanium shell. Overall, Iron Man's a solid movie. It's worth buying, though it's not as good as Verhoeven's Robocop.<br /><br />Author of Gotta Be Down!</p></body></html>

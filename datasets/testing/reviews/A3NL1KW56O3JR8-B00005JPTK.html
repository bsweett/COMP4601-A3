<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>For all the hype, I had expected more. Actually, IAL is essentially a remake of "Omega Man" with Charleston Heston. I swear, it's almost the same movie but with better special effects. The premise is cool but I think they could have done a lot more with the plot. Very predictable and chiche. It's all special effects and little substance. I'd give it 2.5 stars, if I could.<br /><br />Weak and disappointing. Don't buy this movie; wait for it to come out on T.V.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></body></html>

Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career as "Forrest Gump." The director, Robert Zemeckis was creative and brilliant with his vision. It's about a slow-minded man who did everything. Ran away from bullies, fought in Vietnam, got shot in the but-tocks, met the president, played ping-pong, ran some more (this time around the country) and ate shrimp. Yes, what a life. And then he finally got Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) and had a little Forrest. You could tell by a person's shoes what kind of a life they had. If you look at my shoes, you'll see dirt and dog stuff all over them. What does that mean?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thank You For Making Me Laugh: This Is a Killer Satire"></head><body><p>Jason Reitman makes an impressive debut as director with this entertaining comedy `Thank You For Smoking,' which is more satirical than any of the comedies his father Ivan Reitman made. Despite the film's plot about one Nick Naylor, ace spokesperson for the tobacco industry, `Thank You For Smoking' refuses to take sides while keeping us hugely entertained with its dialogues.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart delivers a superb performance as Nick Naylor, a chief spokesman and lobbyist for tobacco industry, who in his `spin' mode can easily manipulate the opinions of the suspicious audiences on TV show. Nick is also a good father to his son Joey (Cameron Bright), before whom Nick tries to be a role model. Today Nick thinks of a brilliant idea of production placement - how about showing Hollywood stars smoking in a spaceship? - he flies to California with his son, meets a suave movie producer wearing kimono (Rob Lowe), and in his free time delivers a package to an ailing old man (Sam Elliott) who is about to sue the tobacco company.<br /><br />The satire is funny, but its target changes frequently. It could be tobacco industry (why not), but also could be those politicians (represented by William H. Macy's senator) who seems very hostile to Nick, and Nick himself. Sometimes the story goes too far, which includes a brief episode of abduction, but it is most effective when it shows Nick's darkly funny conversations with his friends, lobbyists for alcohol and guns (Mari Bello and David Koechner, calling themselves MOD Squad) over their lunch.<br /><br />Other cast includes Robert Duvall, Adam Brody, Kim Dickens, J. K. Simmons, and Katie Holmes. The acting is unanimously good, but the film belongs to Eckhart's Nick Naylor, or his art of spin.<br /><br />The film may lack the thought-provoking ideas about the on-going social issues. Still what you see in `Thank You For Smoking' is always amusing, clever, and even absurdly funny, and is never boring.</p></body></html>

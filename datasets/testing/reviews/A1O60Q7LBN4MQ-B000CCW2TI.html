<meta name="summary" content="A good suspense film"></head><body><p>Because of her job, a woman is being forced to make a call to set up an assassination against her will on a plane. The best part of this movie is when they land. Then it becomes very tense! To me, it seemed more like a very well done made-for-TV movie than a theatrical release. I do recommend this but you may want to wait until it comes on TV.</p></body></html>

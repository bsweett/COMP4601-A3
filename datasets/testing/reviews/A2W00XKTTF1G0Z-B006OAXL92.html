<meta name="summary" content="Hugo is Martin Scorcese's Warmest Film!"></head><body><p>MOVIE NOTE #12: HUGO Based on the book by Brian Selznick's novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret, this film was incredibly enchanting and warm hearted for me. Paramount Pictures's film Hugo, was Co-Produced by Johnny Depp and the director Martin Scorcese (the `Godfather' director himself) - this is Scorcese's first film that didn't involve, the mob, gangsters or guns - this is actually a family film with a very big heart.<br /><br />Rated PG, for he subject matter - it tells the late 1930's tale of a young boy, HUGO (played convincingly by Asa Butterfield of `Nanny McPhee', `Wolfman' & the `Merlin' TV show) who loses his father and takes the place of his uncle (Played by the convincing Ray Winston of `Indiana Jones', &' Percy Jackson and the Olympians') - to do the task of keeping ALL the MANY clocks and their mechanisms working in the world famous and huge Paris railway station. His father, lovingly played by Jude Law (`Sherlock Holmes', `Aviator' & `Alfie'), finds an Automoton (Clock-work Android) that apparently has a special ability that after his fathers death, Hugo goes on his journey of discovery.<br /><br />The whole time Hugo is literally mentally tortured, teased, taunted and abused by one of Academy Award Winner - Sir Ben Kingsly's (`Gandhi', `Schindler's List' & `Prince of Persia') most amazing and heartfelt performances ever. He plays film maker and innovator George M&eacute;li&egrave;s, most noted for the silent film `A Trip To The Moon' - where an oversized bullet takes travelers to the moon and shoots the moon in the eye! `Hugo' although very visual in nature and making full use of the 3D process has beautiful imagery, soft warm tones and a very visual dynamic with all the clock, clock workings and cogs of the machines that tell time in Paris. Not to mention another incredible musical score by Howard Shore (`Lord of the Rings', `Phillidelphia' & `Ed Wood')<br /><br />Young Hugo also has one other problem - he is continuously being chased by the railways Inspector played by the impressive comedic talents of Sarah Baron Cohen (`Sweeney Todd, `Borat' & `Madagascar') who he himself has a malfunction mechanism attached to his leg to help him walk. He and his dog (with his witty smirks) torment Hugo and then unexpectedly gets help from Georges granddaughter - Isabelle (Played by Chloe Grace Moretz of "Kick Ass' & "Diary of a Wimpy Kid') they find their way to know the real story behind her Grandfather and his Father's `message'.<br /> The film is amazingly entertaining and might be a little slow for the younger crowd - but it has amazing performances, visuals and great `not in your face' 3D effects. It's also a great period film too with many details and intricacies.<br /><br />The film also has some impressive performances `sprinkled' throughout by the Bookstore owner played by Christopher Lee (`Star Wars: The Phantom Menace', `Lord of the Rings'), the Inspectors love interest played by Emily Mortimer (`Shutter Island', `Cars 2' & `The Pink Panther' 2008), a `blooming' love romance played ever so gently by Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour (From the Harry Potter films) and the most heartfelt and magical performance of Helen McCrory (the Harry Potter Films, `The Queen' & `Doctor Who') who plays George M&eacute;li&egrave;s's sympathetic and loving wife.<br /><br /> This was refreshing 2 hours and 7 minute film and although the pace is slower that your average shoot-em-up....you really feel apart of Hugo's life. I gotta read the book now!</p></body></html>

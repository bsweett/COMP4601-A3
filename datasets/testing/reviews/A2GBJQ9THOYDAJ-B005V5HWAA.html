<meta name="summary" content="Nice vehicle for the return of Kevin Costner"></head><body><p>This is the best thing Kevin Costner has done in some time and he's entirely believeable as Earl Brooks, Portland's Businessman of the Year, and very experienced serial killer. It's an addiction with him, one he's been able to control for two years by going to AA meetings (and praying a lot), but now he's fallen off the wagon. And even though he takes extreme precautions -- and has remained free because of them -- now someone has seen him. In exchange for keeping his secret, "Mr. Smith" wants to ride along on Brooks's next homicidal outing. What really makes the film, though, is William Hurt as Earl's alter ego. (Superego? "Dark Passenger," in the Dexter sense?) Hurt gives us a marvelous insight on how Earl's mind works, and is sort of a foil for what the viewer wants to know. Demi Moore, as the independently wealthy detective trying to track down the serial killer while also being involved in a messy, greedy divorce, is much less good. She's also -- the third thread -- involved in trying to locate a previous killer she had captured and sent to prison, which doesn't actually have anything to do with Brooks. And I was sure Brooks was going to arrange that particular psychopath's death, but no; he has a different target in mind. Then there's yet another sub-plot involving Earl's daughter, a college freshman, who has quit school and come home pregnant, and who may have murdered another student in her dorm. Or may not have. Her father thinks she did, and goes to some lengths to protect her. But his certainly (which he sees as her inheriting his "murder" gene) may be only in his own mind. There are some plot holes here and there -- we all know that obtaining the camera's memory stick doesn't mean having "all the copies," and there was a lot of traceable blood left on the ground and on the shovel at the cemetery -- but this is generally a very well written, well acted, and thought-provoking film. And there are apparently going to be sequels, so I'll be waiting for them.</p></body></html>

You will literally be thinking about the many themes this film covers for days to come after seeing it. While events never truly repeat themselves from era to era, there are certain experiences that remain constant. Such experiences echo throughout time but take on a new shape with each succeeding generation. <p>"The Hours" features three story arcs: the first is set in the 1940's and features author Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), the second is set in the 1950's and features housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), and the last is set in 2001 and features modern woman Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep). All three women project strong facades to the outer world although each of them is suffering inside. The pressures of conforming to the role of nurturer expected of them continuously clashes with the cultural and social liberation they so desperately crave. There is sadness, despair, and guilt in all of these women's lives and the cold indifference in which their male companions regard their suffering forces them to seek support physically and spiritually in other women. <p>&quot;The Hours&quot; does not directly link the three separate arcs together in any conventional narrative. The three stories exist to illustrate how events throughout time rhyme with each other rather than truly repeat themselves. This film provides unique, but indirect, insights into the female experience through nuance and metaphor. It will therefore prove disorienting to those used to more straightforward styles of storytelling. However, those interested in sampling something different will be rewarded with an emotionally powerful viewing experience. The cast is astonishing with Kidman, Moore, and Streep all showing why they are considered three of the best actresses working today. The supporting cast of Stephen Dillane, John C. Reilly, Allison Janney, Claire Danes, Ed Harris have enough talent themselves to headline their own film but distinguish themselves well in strong supporting performances. Mention must also be made of Philip Glass' musical score which works to accentuate the strong emotional states of the film's various characters. All in all, "The Hours" is an impressive feat of filmmaking that will not easily fade from memory.</p></body></html>

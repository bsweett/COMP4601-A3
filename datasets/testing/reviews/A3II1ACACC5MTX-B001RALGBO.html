<meta name="summary" content="A convenient half-truth"></head><body><p>I like to feel that I am balanced in my scorn of cod-science. For some reason, some people have taken offence to my review of "State of Fear", the Michael Crichton stinker. Ok, TDAT takes some pretty sound scientific principles and drives a bus through them to get a plot out of it. Lets be fair, no one is going to say "oh My God, I`m going to be crushed by that rapidly advancing glacier if I stay routed to this spot for the next couple of thousand years", so I can allow them their scientific whimsies for dramatic purposes. But I was able to ignore the science (and as an environmental scientist who does this stuff every day, if I can do it, so can you) enough to enjoy the film for what it is, an Independence Day type of disaster movie, and to be fair, probably more plausible than being invaded by aliens (which is kind of disappointing as I recently enjoyed a screening of "V-The Mini-series" on Sci-Fi Channel recently).<br /><br />On the science front, I would place it as equivalent to cloning dinosaurs from extinct DNA, sounds sorta pseudo science possible, but actually we are unlikely to be over-run by velociraptors on our way to do the Christmas shopping next year. And if you are, like TDAT's tidal waves, a simple revolving door should keep you safe.<br /><br />One thing I hope isn't true is that the makers of the film were asked to speak to Congressional Hearings on Climate Change. I don't think the film sets out to be "An Inconvenient Truth" with special effects, just a popcorn enhancing flick.  I like to think of it as more "a convenient half truth".<br /><br />(PS - If someone else has used that, sorry, I didn't read all 700 reviews.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MY FAVORITE FILM OF ALL TIME"></head><body><p>I reviewed PULP FICTION a few months ago, but decided to review it again, to simply state that I absolutely love it. It seems way too perfect to be made by humans...it almost seems as if God himself came down and put it all together. If you are a true film fan, you should have this, no exceptions. If you like movies even the smallest bit, you will love this to death.<p>The price for this movie is nothing...I would've payed ANYTHING for this. Quentin Tarantino is a complete genius and has a way of making the audiences LOVE his films. Both PULP FICTION and RESERVOIR DOGS have both won their way into my heart, seeming like they're my brothers. Every single minute of PULP FICTION is true movie pleasure. The characters are so complex along with the story. The script is practically required reading at film school now-a-days.<p>The writing, along with every thing else, is brilliant, a complete achievement. Critics and movie-lovers alike all hail this movie as "A True Masterpiece" and is on many top 10 films lists.<p>Every single thing in this movie is polished down to every little detail. When I watch PULP FICTION, it's more than just watching a movie...it's a whole event, a unique and wonderful experience. The whole film jumps out of the screen at you. If there's one movie you should set time aside to watch and invite your friends over to watch, it's PULP FICTION. It seems as if you're in the movie. I LOVE IT! Well, that's about all I have to say...<p>PULP FICTION is a complete American Movie Masterpiece.</p></body></html>

This film definitely did that for me:  it is fast, scary, and for the most part just realistic enough.  A few scenes are over the top, but not many.  Spy action films can also be very fun in that they keep you guessing as to what is really going on, with clues, sudden choices, and shocking revelations.  This filkeeps you guessing more or less to the very end, changing the viewer's mind not once, but twice or even three times in what may be a record.  Good guys become bad guys and vice versa, but multiple times!  Even some (admittedly crude) politics come into it.  Of course, there is also a question of style, that is, how cool the characters are, how sexy.  Here again, Jolie proves herself a gifted, charismatic screen presence, one of the greatest woman character actors at the moment as well as a star.  She is sleek, strong, and sinuous, exuding both sensuality and hard concentration.  These elements work in this film eminently well.<br /><br />However, at the deeper level, that of emotional identification with the character, the film is weaker.  Sure, Salt has connections with her past and present that make themselves felt, but I did not empathize much with her mission and plight.  To be sure, that isn't required in an action film, but it is in the very best of the genre.  The supreme masterpiece that does this is the Bourne Trilogy, which reached a new level of realistic action with an emotional overlay.  Bourne sets a new standard that the new James Bond series accomplishes with some success for an old character, but Salt doesn't quite reach it - yet.<br /><br />Recommended.  I hope it becomes a series, because its potential is high and with a better script, we can expect much more.</p></body></html>

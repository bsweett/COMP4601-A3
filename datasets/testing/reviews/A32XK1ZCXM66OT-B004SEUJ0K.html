<meta name="summary" content="Still an great movie, however......"></head><body><p>I did enjoyed this movie. It still delivered with all the themes of the X-men comic book. Basically, the plot of the movie is a very simple and direct one. When a medical company comes out with a cure that can supress the mutant gene peramently in mutants. It divides the mutant population. Some mutants want the cure, while others join up with Magneto to try and  stop the company from making it. While others team up with the X-men to try and help them stop Magneto. There's also a subplot to this film. When Jean Grey is found alive, the X-men discover that Jean Grey has become very powerful and dangerous to herself and to her teamates. The X-men are face with a tough decision, on how to stop her. All in all, this is a great movie. (However, I did find this movie hard to watch. Due to the fact, there was some graphic scenes. So, if you have children. I would advise that you don't let them watch this movie).</p></body></html>

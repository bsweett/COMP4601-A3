<meta name="summary" content="Great Restored Feature (The Version You've Never Seen DVD review)"></head><body><p>I have few fonder memories of viewing a feature film in a theater than those recorded when I attended a screening of this widely promoted, extended version of The Exorcist during an unseasonably cold September evening nine years ago. Not all of my enjoyment was derived from the film itself. Now, it was a thrill to watch a film that I'd grown up with (which predated me by six years) on the big screen and to finally see numerous exciting and poignant scenes (that I'd read at least twice before in William Peter Blatty's brilliant novel) realized by the comfortably familiar cast. However, my attention was frequently split between the film and an audience around me that grew increasingly, uncomfortably tense as it progressed. In particular, a teenage boy and his mother were seated before me. It's possible that these two were Good Catholics, present to see a famous, Vatican-approved motion picture of faith and redemption; also, that the son might have pestered his mom to take him to see a bit of horror history; most likely, that the mother had seen it ages ago, had long forgotten the most explicit portions and perhaps subscribed to the idiotic popular fallacy that mainstream movies nowadays are harsher than they were thirty-odd years ago. Shoulders rose and tightened as that notion was quickly dispelled, but only when adorable Linda Blair messily introduced a crucifix to her hymen did Mother Dearest mutter, "Oh, for Christ's sake!" and slap a hand over her son's virgin eyes. Behind them, I sported an ear-to-ear grin. Veteran character actor Barton Heyman wasn't even back on his feet before three couples exited the theater. A few more followed even before the great Max von Sydow appeared to attend to the movie's ultimate confrontation.<br /><br />Not for the last time, I was reminded of the increasingly lightweight culture in which I'm living.<br /><br />Well, never mind - it's been on DVD for a good long while and watching it again evokes these memories, which are very different than those associated with my worn old VHS copy. It's easier on the eyes and ears, too: the digitally remastered picture and sound are first-rate. Of that beautiful Technicolor, hues and contrast are as striking as ever. More demanding than most, the 1979 six-channel Dolby Stereo mix is satisfactorily conveyed in two soundtracks - a Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and mono-compatible 2.0. The 5.1 track sounds fantastic on any good sound system and while the 2.0 track is slightly muddled, it's better suited to TV speakers or cheap headphones. Bold, white English and French subtitles are included, and are merely adequate; take note that the English subs were certainly not designed for the deaf or hard of hearing.<br /><br />Ever since this version was re-released to theaters, its primary selling point has been eleven minutes of footage deleted from the original theatrical cut, very little of which had ever been seen by the general public. Restored to impressive effect, this material was edited in congruity with the artful subtlety of the original feature. Scenes containing or consisting wholly of restored footage are helpfully asterisked in the comprehensive forty-eight-scene selection menu. Less than a dozen scenes were spruced up with CGI effects, but Friedkin was careful not to take the tasteless, revisionist route through which a certain bearded man-child filmmaker stupidly, contemporaneously trudged, so these touches are minor, serving only to enhance the footage in question. My single gripe concerns the excessive use of an otherwise unobjectionable cue composed especially for this release by Steve Boddacker - an ominous, minimalist drone that newly scored a number of scenes. This was such a mistake: the quiet tension during the announcement of Burke Dennings' death and especially the first conversation between Fr. Karras and Lt. Kinderman was what made them so disquieting, while this music only reminds us that it's there. It doesn't ruin these scenes - the performances are too good to permit that - but it is a persistent distraction. Attentive fans might notice that the Casablanca reference voiced by Kinderman and Dyer at the film's very end was omitted, even though the scene is available in its entirety as a special feature in the 25th Anniversary Special Edition. The exhaustive behind-the-scenes documentary, The Fear of God is also exclusive to that edition.<br /><br />If you're looking for a commentary track that provides a dramatic, insightful and slightly pretentious summary of every scene, William Friedkin's is definitely what you want. However, it really wasn't what I wanted. Friedkin has a great voice for this kind of presentation, but I don't need somebody to tell me about what I can see and hear for myself. He also explains a couple of subtle, symbolic elements that I hadn't noticed and shares a few (too few) amazing bits of trivia, most of which are related to the shoot in Sinjar, Iraq. I certainly don't expect Friedkin's memory of a film that he directed over a quarter-century before to be perfect, but I wanted more of that: details about the production, the actors, the effects and locations. If his memory is limited, why didn't Warner ask screenwriter/producer Blatty to record it with him? Lord knows, he's never at a loss for something to say about any of his projects. During Karras's dream, Friedkin explains that it wasn't in the novel and that he "added" it to the film. While he certainly added significant imagery to it, he's either lying or grossly mistaken - in the novel, that dream is mentioned in brief and significant detail.<br /><br />In lieu of the The Fear of God documentary or much revealing information in the commentary track, four text commentaries explain Blatty's inspiration for the original story, Friedkin's rejection of Blatty's first screenplay and their disputes over numerous deleted scenes, the infamous "spider walk" sequence and some other bits of trivia. This is hardly as enjoyable or revealing as the documentary, but it's better than nothing.<br /><br />Four TV spots, two radio spots and two theatrical trailers promoting the re-release are included, most of which are quite good and especially better than the leaden 1973 trailer.<br /><br />On the whole, this really is superior to the 1973 cut, but the original theatrical release is still worth seeing, and available in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEGC">The Complete Anthology box set</a>. If you just want to own one version and haven't seen both, torrent the original and rent this on Netflix; if you prefer the original, that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079073804X">25th Anniversary edition</a> is always floating around, and quite affordable besides...</p></body></html>

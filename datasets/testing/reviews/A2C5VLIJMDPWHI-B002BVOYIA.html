I had no idea of the situation in Africa within this movie until now, and I am totally crushed by the sick and twisted acts of prejudice that can happen from outsiders (Belgia).  Wow.  I understand that there was hardship before between the two but when leaving people of the same country in charge, I would've hoped things would've ceased. I understand that people have built up hate from being the "lesser" when the Belgia were there, but turning on their own people does not help the situation. I do understand their anger though.  Mistrust can make people do funny things.  I find it even worse that the same people who started differentiating between the two are the people who were too cowardly to go back.  I am not surprised.  I think this may make lots of people in America uncomfortable from visualizing what can happen if the minority becomes the majority and withholds anger from predudice and racism in the past.  Fortunately, I doubt this will happen.  I cried so hard at the end of this movie that you would've thought I knew the people personally, and I am absolutely not a cryer.  Phenomenal movie.  Excellent cast.  I could care less about an award, the meaning of the movie should be held at the top of the ladder regardless.</p></body></html>

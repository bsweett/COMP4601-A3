When they merge, they bring together one phenomenal trilogy.<br />  The first and best installment in the Indiana Jones series is Raiders of the Lost Arc.  Ford really made an icon out of the action hero.  The action was wonderful.  The plot was very very good, and the acting was great.  It is one of the greatest films of all time.  A definate five star film<br />  The second and probably least impressive of the three is the Temple of Doom.  Too bad Marion, couldn't have been the Jones girl in this film, but Kate Capshaw played a really good role.  The effects were not as impressive as the first, and the plot was a little harder to believe, but it ultimately wasn't dissappointing.  3 Stars.<br />  The Last Crusade is the third installment into the trilogy.  It was definately better than the sequel, but still didn't equal up to the first installment.  Sean Connery was wonderful, who better play Ford's dad.  The effects were better.  And what better than to bring the Holy Grail into the trilogy.  Four stars.</p></body></html>

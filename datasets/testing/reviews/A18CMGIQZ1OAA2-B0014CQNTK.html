After having sex for the first time in a chair juno finds herself pregnant and being an assertive little thing get in her mind she's gonna do right by the baby and not only put the baby up for adoption but find parents she sees fit.  She looks in the Penny Saver and this is the story that goes on from that.  Its not a sugar coated story of teen pregnancy but its not a depressing one either.  It simply approaches a sensitive topic with humor and along with a great soundtrack and a great cast including Jennifer Garner and Ellen Page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great movie turned bad"></head><body><p>Just to let you know, this movie is one of my personal favorite ghost movies. That said, I feel I need to tell you some details about this terrible DVD. The packaging is fine, nothing great, but it works. The picture and sound quality are good and make it a good cinematic experience. However, the menu is complete trash, the extras are EXTREMELY embarassing, and to play the movie you actually have to click on scene selections and click on the first chapter because there is no PLAY button! What's the problem here? As I recall, this film is on AFI's top 100 funniest movies ever made, so don't you think they could make a better DVD than this garbage? I am so sick and tired of these movie companies getting away with selling us trash.<p>This double sided disk is no good. Pick what format you want the first time you watch it, and stick with that side the whole time...because if you switch each time, both sides get scratched! Personally, I think fullscreen is for idiots who think they're getting the whole picture when they're not. You people put no actual thought into making DVDs, you just slap some crap together and think its fine. No, it's not fine! Clean up your acts!</p></body></html>

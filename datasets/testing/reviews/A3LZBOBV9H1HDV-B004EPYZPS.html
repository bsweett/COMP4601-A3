<meta name="summary" content=""Super 8" is brilliant!"></head><body><p>"Super 8" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In the summer of 1979, a group of friends in a small Ohio town witness a catastrophic train crash while making a super 8 movie and soon suspect that it was not an accident. Shortly after, unusual disappearances and inexplicable events begin to take place in town, and the local Deputy tries to uncover the truth - something more terrifying than any of them could have imagined.<br /><br />The cast led by Kyle Chandler (as Jackson Lamb) & Elle Fanning (as Alice Dainard) is excellent. The story, screenplay & directing by J.J. Abrams (who also produced) is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Michael Giacchino is excellent. The cinematography by Larry Fong is excellent. The film editing by Maryann Brandon & Mary Jo Markey is excellent. The casting by Alyssa Weisberg & April Webster is excellent. The production design by Martin Whist is excellent. The art direction by David Scott & Domenic Silvestri is excellent. The set decoration by Fainche MacCarthy is excellent. The costume design by Ha Nguyen is excellent. The visual effects by ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) are brilliant. The creature design by Neville Page is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliant film that superbly harkens back to Steven Spielberg classics, like "E.T" & "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind", ironically, Spielberg produced this film. This is a well-crafted original story that keeps you entertained and on the edge of your seat while your heart races at a faster rate. This is J.J. Abrams' best film of his career, so far. This is also the best movie of the summer and of the year, so far.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="In Another World Where Things Aren't What They Seem."></head><body><p>This modernistic movie was based on the animated MTV series and a video game about an emotionless female assassin.  In 2011, life on earth was eradicated by some explosive device and the surviving group formed the perfect society called Bregna, ruled over by the Goodchild regime.  The dessident organization out to defeat this was a group who dressed in funky black clothes and used gymnastics and acrobatics to get around the security systems.<br /><br />Charlize Theron who won an Oscar for playing a real-life 'Monster,' now with a figure like Cyd Charisse, leads the way to the doom of the Goodchilds.  She feels like she is in a gilded cage but has dreams of memories she does not understand.  She said that she had a life once, but now all she has is a mission.  We must show the way.  She agrees to go to the Citadel where they will have their revenge and we will all have victory.  There, in the forum, she confronts Trevor, played by Marton Csokas, and acts like a female John Wilkes Booth until he calls her Catherine which rings a bell.  Nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />Be careful what you wish for!  Trevor showed her what it felt like to be a person instead of an unfeeling thing.  He told her, "We both are still alive for a reason.  Everything changed when I saw you."  Both were clones of the originals and the doctor over the lab told her, "I knew you were important, so I saved your DNA."  In a war, people on all sides die.  There would have to be consequences to their indiscreet actions.  He is betrayed by his brother, Orrin, who declared that what he did was treason.<br /><br />Suddenly, the situation has changed and has become more complicated.  He'd told her, "You had your chance, so you know where to find me."  Clones, they realize, are just like ghosts.  I needed to protect you; you are an idea I kept alive.  She agrees, "I remembered you."  After their escape, she patched him together again.  We watch a slaughter down among the cherry blossoms and Orrin is defeated.  It's the end results that count in this case, not how pretty the path is getting there.  Aeon climbs aboard the cloning lab in the flying saucer with the gold trailers floating underneath and sets the explosives to destroy it.  After all, we are meant to live only once, but with hope.  The use of the heligraph of the 400-year-old doctor was very effective.  It was a good diversion from the cold weather and Christmas crowds and music.  It was a nice interlude into fantasy and sci fi at its best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding!"></head><body><p>I just got up from watching this outstanding movie. Here we have a young woman who believes she had a child, 9 year old Sam, but who is told that the child only exists in her mind.<br /><br />Even her husband tells her that, but she cannot let go of the belief that he truly lived, and was killed in a plane crash with a group of other children.<br /><br />  This movie was a real pull on the mind.  You knew what she was feeling was true or there would be no storyline, yet could everyone in her world be in on the  evil of making her believe Sam never existed?  Interesting! And to find out it was forces not of this world was really entertaining.<br /><br /> I loved some of the scenes when the characters were pulled out of this world, it was great, just where did they go anyway? And having a happy ending for mom and child was the cream on the cake.  Of course, one can't help but wonder what happened to all the other children that were 'forgotten.' All in all I think this movie was very good and I believe you will enjoy watching it.</p></body></html>

I can honestly say that, for the most part, we were not let down.  `Waitress' is a delightfully funny little film that's got layers of meaning and warmth that line the sarcasm and humor beautifully.  There are moments where it seems a little overdone in my opinion, and Keri Russell's performance (while wonder in a complete sense) seems to lack a little in moments.  The script though is what really makes this movie what it is, and the late Adrienne Shelly concocted one of the most entertaining scripts of the year.  It's witty, charming, serious, connected and complete.<br /><br />`Waitress' follows the pregnancy of young Jenna, a local pie maker who hates her life in its entirety.  She's married to a jerk of a man who watches her every move and demands all her time and attention.  Her friends Becky and Dawn don't have half the life she has yet they wouldn't trade shoes with her, not ever.  When Jenna finds out that she is pregnant she is devastated.  It's just one more thing holding her back, keeping her in this town that she loathes with a man she regrets in every way.<br /><br />Jenna decides to keep the baby.  She respects its right to live even though she feels no affection for it and so she starts seeing a doctor.  Her hormones mixed with the overwhelming hinge of regret bring her to fall into an affair with her married doctor and gradually her outlook begins to change.  She has found a small slice of happiness and even though she knows that what she is doing is ultimately wrong she can't stop because it's the only thing she has to hold on to, the only thing that will keep her sane throughout this whole ordeal.<br /><br />This little film is filled with delightful performances by the entire supporting cast.  Nathan Fillion comes off a bit awkward in the beginning but as Jenna's relationship grows with Dr. Pomatter he becomes a more fleshed out and understandable.  Jeremy Sisto is insanely crazy as Jenna's husband Earl and Lew Temple and Eddie Jemison do well to bring life to their small roles as love interests of Jenna's friends.  Keri Russell gives a sweetly endearing performance that is, like I said, wonderful when looking at the complete picture.  My wife in particular loved her blunt delivery of her lines and feelings.  I felt that she was a bit too blunt at times which made it hard to crack her hard exterior and find the real woman on the inside.  There are a few scenes where she nails it, and overall she is wonderful, but there are some areas where I wish she would have worked at it a little better.<br /><br />This movie, in my humble opinion, belongs to two people, Cheryl Hines and Andy Griffith, both of whom steal every scene with their impeccable humor and delivery.  Cheryl Hines is delightfully sarcastic as Becky and Andy Griffith gives one of my favorite supporting performances of the year.  He understands Joe and this works in his, and our, favor.  Adrienne Shelly not only wrote and directed this film but also stars as Dawn, Jenna's gawky friend.  She does a great job of balancing the humor with real emotion.  The tragedy surrounding this film and her untimely death was terrible to hear about, and after seeing this film my wife was actually brought to tears when I told her about Shelly's death.<br /><br />`Waitress' is not a film that will disappoint.  It will make you smile, make you cry and make you fall in love frame by frame.  It's a sweet balance between the comic and the dramatic portions of life that we all come across.  Sit back and enjoy.</p></body></html>

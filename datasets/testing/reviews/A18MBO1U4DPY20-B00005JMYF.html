There's not much to write about here. Ben Stiller is somehow amusing  in his MCP mad man way and I thought there were a few average funny scenes.Mind you, I'll watch any Ben Stiller movie that comes out. However when it comes to purchasing , I dont think this movie is really worth owning.Thats all.Sadly there's not much of Dodgeball in it. I was enjoying the game but I wish there were more minutes devouted to it.</p></body></html>

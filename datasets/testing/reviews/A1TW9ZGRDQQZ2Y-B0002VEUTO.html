This is the easily Vin Diesel's best role as it was playing the same character in "Pitch Black." The story is a little too detailed for this type of film, but it actually makes the film seem more for us people with an IQ of at least 100, which is much better than seeing a pure brainless Sci-Fi affair. There is some comedy (Diesel has some great one-liners) and the Special Effects are very good. The 100 Million dollar price tag on this film obviously went to Vin Diesel and the SFX. I was worried the PG-13 would detract from the enjoyment I had of actually seeing a little gore like in "Pitch Black," but the action scenes were full of so much energy and Diesel's powerful movements that I did not miss all the blood and guts that really were not needed in this movie. So in short, grab a few of your friends and head to see this Sci-Fi/Action Adventure while it is still on the Big Screen!</p></body></html>

Critics ripped it to shreds saying that it was too sappy and sweet.  Humbug.  This is the most classic film of all time and if you haven't seen this yet then you haven't really had Christmas.  Yes, yes I know they show it 500,000 times every Christmas but that's because people love it so.  I'm glad that Jimmy Stewart lived long enough to see it become so loved by movie watchers around the world.<br /><br />In case you've been living on Mars for the past hundred years, it's the story of George Bailey (James Stewart) who wants to build great buildings and travel the world.  He feels left out as all his friends go on to college while he helps his father at the family business.  Just when he's all set to finally go to college his father dies and he has to stay on at the Bailey Building and Loan.  A few years later his brother comes home but has just gotten married and received a job offer even though he was supposed to be coming home to take over the business so George could finally travel.  No such luck.<br /><br />Finally George realizes that he's not going anywhere and he's married with four kids.  One day his uncle misplaces $8,000.00 bucks and George is threatened with jail time.  He loses all hope and decides it would be better if he had never been born and plans to commit suicide but an angel shows him what would have happend if he had not been born. The angel convinces him that he should not throw away God's greatest gift.  It turns out that he helped so many people (including saving the life of his only brother) none of them would have made it without his help.  Because he saved his brother, his brother was able to save the lives of many of his comrads in the army.  Because of that, his brother won the Congressional Medal of Honor.  But George learns that if he had not been there to save his brother, every man on that army transport would have died because his brother would not have been there to save them.  Because he helped so many along the way, they in turn help him when he's in the darkest pit of his life.<br /><br />This may be the most spoofed movie of all time.  Saturday Night Live spoofed it more than once and so did Married with Children just to name a couple of shows.  Perhaps even more spoofed is the ever popular Scrooge.<br /><br />It's a Wonderful Life is a Timeless classic.  It applies itself to any year, any day, any country, any family, any race.  "One life touches so many others."  Ain't that the truth.  Don't pass this by.  Please watch this with your children.  It is still as heart warming as ever.  You can even take it back to Mars with you when you leave!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Director's Cut: A whole different movie"></head><body><p>Being as my experience with director's cuts involved moving scenes about, adding a few deleted scenes, and/or changing the ending (even Ridley Scott's director's cut of Blade Runner did little more than remove the ending and the voiceover), I was vastly surprised to find out that this movie had been so thoroughly butchered for a theatrical run that the "director's cut" comes out to be a whole movie in itself rather than "oh hey, he says an extra line different from the movie".<br /><br />While the extended cut adds only about 45 minutes of film, it feels like it adds a whole new half to the movie, which makes it seem for the first time like the theatrical cut was actually "half" of a movie.<br /><br />Spoilers might follow.<br /><br />A lot of new scenes include minor tidbits for entertainment, while the majority of it has further explanation, exposition, and even a full subplot that had been not quite masterfully cut from the theatrical version.<br /><br />- The whole dealy involving the priest Balian kills is explained, as it's revealed the Priest is Balian's half-brother, the legitimate son of their mother, who had Balian as a bastard.<br /><br />- It's revealed that Balian had fought in wars before, and thus had a reason for putting up such a strategic defense of Jerusalem---there is even a scene of him discussing the tactics in properly fortifying a city like Jerusalem with King Baldwin IV<br /><br />- Godfrey is shown to be the brother of the village lord where Balian lives, and the lord is the one who sends the attack raid on Godfrey.<br /><br />- Salah ad-Din beheads Reynald, which is considered more historically accurate.<br /><br />- A whole entire sub-plot is re-inserted regarding Baldwin V---Sibylla's son.  After Baldwin IV's death, Sibylla crowns her son King, only to discover after accidentally spilling hot wax on his hand that like his uncle, he has leprosy.  Rather than suffer the backlash of the people on knowledge that she has birthed a leper, and that she may lose her power for it, she kills her son with poison to spare him the leprosy and herself the loss of power.<br /><br />- Emotionally devastated by killing her son, Sibylla's actions afterwards are more recognizable and understandable beyond "she's an idiot".  Guy de Lusignon knows about the affair she's had with Balian, and uses this against her to get himself crowned King of Jerusalem after Baldwin V dies.<br /><br />To add benefits to this set is a vast collection of documentaries focused on all aspects of making the film from pre-production to post-production, working with actors from well-known Orlando Bloom, to newcomer-to-American-audiences Ghassan Massoud as Salah ad-Din, to even acknowledging the bad reviews the theatrical film received, which prompted the release of the director's cut.</p></body></html>

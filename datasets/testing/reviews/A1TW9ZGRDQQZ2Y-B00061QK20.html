<meta name="summary" content="Very Good, but Not a Great Film Liked I Had Hoped For!"></head><body><p>Just got back from seeing this film in a sold out theater. I must admit, at least half of the audience seemed to dislike the movie a great deal (especially the guys). The fight scenes aren't really that great and most consist of flying around and close-ups of the actor's faces. The fight between Jet Li and Donnie Yen towards the start of the film being the exception, which was pretty good. The visuals are what make the movie work. No, not visual effects, but the colors and locations really have an impact and grasp your attention throughout the short 95 minute running time. Jet Li is pretty good, but really doesn't do a whole lot in terms of fighting and Zhang Ziyi is very pretty (the girl from "Crouching Tiger") as always. The story is actually pretty good and follows the plot layering that was used in "The Usual Suspects," where you hear a bunch of stories that are untrue until the truth is finally revealed at the end. I think it's worth seeing if you like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," and if not at least see it once it hits Dvd. You gotta see "Fist of Legend" for some true Jet Li butt-kickin, beccause you won't get it in this film.</p></body></html>

I like "thriller," but in last 25+ years most horror films have been "slasher" - blood, guts, and gore - instead of good, honest, edge of your seat psychological thriller.  1408, however, successfully returns the thriller genre to the big screen.<br /><br />1408 pulls you in quickly and keeps on going.  The pacing is just right.  The intensity of this film is excellently timed, bringing you to your edge of your seat, and then releasing you.  This rollercoaster effect actually increases the "thrill" of the thriller; you do not get numb and disconnected from constant slashing and bashing, fright and horror.<br /><br />The performances are terrific.  John Cusak is great as always. Samuel Jackson is riveting and appropriately spooky.  The little girl, Jasmine Jessica Anthony, is extremely talented.  The rest of the supporting cast does a similarly nice job.<br /><br />As I said, there is very blood, guts, and gore in this film; it is a true thriller.  It is the LACK of said blood, guts, and gore that gives this film its psychological edge, and prevents it from becoming a slash `em up film.<br /><br />I recommend this film.  For a good, old fashioned, yet up to date thriller, 1408 is the movie to see.</p></body></html>

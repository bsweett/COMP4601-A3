<meta name="summary" content="One of the Most Visually Stunning Comic Book Movies ever made"></head><body><p>Walk down the right back alley and you can find anything in Sin City, the tagline of Frank Miller's entertaining B&W/Color action packed triumph. One of the most violent movies I've ever, but a breathtaking amazing experience, I saw it in the theater and I've never seen any movie like it before. It was very different. A thrilling and electrifying story of detectives, hookers, crooks and others in a dark city who get a dose of their medicine. An allstar cast including Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Benico Del Toro, Brittany Murphy and Mickey Rourke. If like action and good comic book story telling, then this one of the best ever made. It's like a dark Dick Tracy. experience the adreline rush and the excitement of this must see and own comic book triumph.</p></body></html>

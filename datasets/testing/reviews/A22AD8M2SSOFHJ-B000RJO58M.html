<meta name="summary" content="Funny but slow..."></head><body><p>One of my favorite movies is Shaun of the Dead.  That being said I expected more of the same with this movie.  After watching the movie it wasn't the same.  The physical comedy I enjoyed so much is not evident early on.  The comedy and banter is dry early on.  The action is rather lacking for the first hour.  Then when the movie heats up it really becomes a lot of fun.<br /><br />This movie is different and for those expecting an American type action movie you better turn away.  Hot Fuzz features a lot and I mean a lot of dry English humor.  It's good but don't expect any real laugh til your sides hurt moments.  Hot Fuzz is rather enjoyable if you approach it with an open mind.  The same main characters for Shaun of the Dead are here and the on screen chemistry is good.  This movie is almost unusual to be stranger than Shaun of the Dead.<br /><br />In the end I really liked this movie.  The acting is very good and action scenes are funny and intense.  The sound quality on my home theatre was very good and that helped add to the movie.  For any fan of Shaun of the Dead this is definately a must watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Has No Relevance In Our Political Times But It Does Thrill"></head><body><p>MOVIE: If you were to go to The American Film Institute's website you would see that the original Manchurian Candidate sits at number 67 for the best 100 movies in the last 100 years. The only question that strikes me here is why fix something if it's not broken? The original is a political thriller about the communism scare during the Cold War. The reason it's a classic is that the movie's plot delt with the possibilty that an outside evil could be controlling us, and the film also was telling the audience that communism is a government that will hypnotize you and your life, it was a message from the film makers. This new version uses the same idea of &quot;control&quot; except that instead of pointing at communism it's pointing at the idea that we live in a corrupt world, that our government is corrupt. Okay. . .I'm pretty sure that idea has been presented before, and in reality our government is corrupt in some ways and we know that. The movie does show us an almost fictional way of how the government is being controlled and that can raise questions like &quot;does the executive branch really have the most power or are they influenced enormously by others?&quot; While the answer to that question may be simple it also may be complex. The problem with the movie here is that the issues raised in the movie are way too fictional and far out to have any reference to our daily lives. Microchips implanted in our nation's leaders' brains is something that someone would say &quot;yeah right!&quot; to. The original delt with communism, a very real threat at the time. While the new modern version has the similar formula of the original movie, the main ingredient has been changed and the flavor just doesn't seem right.<br /><br /> ACTING: This is a movie where if they had mediocre actors then the movie would have been considered an insult to John Frankenheimer. Denzel Washington gives a very convincing performance and it adds to the effect of the movie. Meryl Streep pulls off the role of the evil mother, but I still find Angela Lansbury's performance much better. The acting was top notch overall and all that emotion was needed to keep the audience entertained. Jonathan Demme also added to the tense atmosphere by using a lot of close-ups for character shots. Everytime an actor is delivering an emotional line the camera is always focused with the chin at the bottom of the screen and the top of the head at the top of the screen. This forces the audience to focus in the actors' eyes to really get the emotion, but just the fact of having to force emotion to the audience shows that remaking a classic wasn't easy.<br /><br /> BOTTOM LINE: What if someone said that Hollywood was going to remake Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, or Ben-Hur . . . exactly! This modern version is no match for the original classic, and even though the original may have lost its touch due to the passing of communistic fears it still holds the values that make it way better than this modern tale.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Redemptive Elvis Mummy Picture"></head><body><p>I bought this movie, because the premise seemed so totally outlandish to me I just had to know what secrets it held. This is one of my favorite movies in a long time. It is definitely my favorite horror movie to date. I won't give away too much of the plot, as it is so delicious you need to watch it unfold in front of you with no preconceptions. Suffice it to say that Elvis is still alive and living in a nursing home in Texas with JFK. Due to a quirky turn of fate the two of them team up and battle an Egyptian mummy in an amazing battle of wits that is metaphorically a battle of good versus evil. There are many unusual twists and turns in the plot, but I was greatly heartened by the ending.<p>Bruce Campbell is Elvis in the movie. When I say he is Elvis, I mean he IS Elvis. He is wonderful as the elderly crabby Elvis and makes the film the success it is. The other lead role, that of President Kennedy (who is alive, but has a sandbag placed in part of his head) is played by the gifted Ossie Davis, a wonderful actor, who, if you don't know, is black (They dyed me this color!) These two become friends at the depressing nursing home, where they are patronized by the staff incessantly. <p>Perhaps I should have titled the review &quot;Elvis and JFK Battle a Mummy Texas Style,&quot; but this really is mostly a story of redemption. Eventually Elvis and JFK realize that they are the only ones able to conquer the mummy and it gives them a reason to live, and in the end, redemption. This brings up my very favorite point about this film. It is wonderful seeing two elderly heroes in this movie. In a society where so many of our elderly are invisible and the entire culture is youth-obsessed it was a brilliant masterstroke to show the value of our elders by making them the heroes. In real life Bruce Campbell is not elderly (he had lots of makeup), but Ossie Davis really is 83, and still looks great. <p>There are many moments of humor in the film, my favorite of which is when Elvis and JFK discover hieroglyphics written on a bathroom stall wall that JFK translates as &quot;Pharaoh gobbles donkey goobers; Cleopatra does the nasty.&quot; There are also bizarre fight scenes, such as when Elvis takes on the giant flying scarab beetle with some karate moves and a bedpan. There are other cool effects such as when the mummy 'speaks' in amusing hieroglyphics and the stars move to spell out a message to Elvis in the end. The mummy himself is very well done, and very creepy. This movie has something for everyone, and I recommend it highly. If I could change one thing it would be a bit of the sporadically bad language, although it is basically used to reinforce the crankiness of the two title characters.<p>The extras on the DVD are compendious, and well worth watching. There are commentary tracks (including one by Elvis!), and 'making of' type documentaries, which you need to watch. It is fabulous that they made such an original and worthwhile movie on such a low budget. I will watch for more from Don Coscarelli and the other makers of this mind-altering film.<p>Bravo!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DEATH WISH BUTLER!"></head><body><p>What do you get when you take the disturbed genius from Seven, the sadistically brutal revenge from Man on Fire, the attack and subsequent vigilante justice from the awesome Death Wish Collection, and the structure crashing desire for anarchy from Fight Club? The product is the immensely enjoyable action thriller Law Abiding Citizen.<br /><br />When wealthy engineer Gerard Butler sees his family murdered as he lay helpless on the ground, anguish and pain rule his life. His lawyer, assistant DA Jamie Foxx, is a slick winner known for an extraordinarily high conviction percentage. Against his wishes, Foxx brokers a deal in exchange for testimony from one of the criminals. Predictably, the scumbag goes free early, and Butler is beside himself with disbelief when he sees his lawyer talking to the rat. Rather than go all "Time to Kill" on everyone, Butler decides to let the pot simmer deep inside. Fast forward ten years, and Foxx - now one step away from being the DA - must deal with a rich and vengeful Butler who has boiled over with rage at his misgivings with the U.S. legal system.<br /><br />This is one of those movies perfect for viewers who shut their brains off, or for those who must question everything. For the former, there is nonstop action, plotting, and awesome revenge that rivals the best vigilante justice ever seen. Butler is perfectly calculating, displaying what a resourceful person can do with no other true goal in life but to exact revenge and pain upon those who have caused harm. For the latter, it's an introspective look at crime, prosecution, and justice. Regardless of aspects that may be a little difficult to believe - but not quite Armageddon unbelievable - it definitely causes a viewer to evaluate the justice system flaws...while enjoying the Butler's wisecracks and richly deserved revenge that every family member who has suffered through something like the actions of this movie's killers.<br /><br />From top to bottom this is a very entertaining movie. It's not all explosions and shock scenes, nor is it a snoozefest. With great directing and acting, a concept with which most people can support, and a clever ending that is fair considering the protagonist dichotomy, it's easy to root for each side of justice, and each character's goal. And if that is possible, then the point being made in this film is successful. I highly recommend this film.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

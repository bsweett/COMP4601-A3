No.  But the Punisher did a good job of being exactly what it wanted to be:  A solid action movie.<br /><br />I think the problem lies in with the character itself.  In the late 80's and early 90's the Punisher was one of Marvel's top characters.  He starred in three of his own monthly titles.  A rare honor that previously had been reserved only for Spiderman and the X-men. Yet still, he was a realatively unknown character to the general populace.<br /><br />The Punisher is an anti-hero and I think the violence perhaps put critics off thinking maybe he was a vigilante in the vein of Batman.<br /><br />The plot is well known.  Frank Castle is a just retired FBI operative.  In his last bust the son of a Miami mobster, Howard Saint. (played well by John Travolta) is killed and he seeks revenge by Killing Castles entire family at a reunion in Puerto Rico.<br /><br />Castle survives his wounds and then seeks out first to destroy Saint's organization and then Saint and his cronies themselves.<br /><br />Thomas Jane I thought did a good job in understating his role.  The Punisher is NOT a fun guy.  He's a bit morose and very intense.  Jane was able to display both of these characteristics very well as the grieving husband and father an the hell-bent for revenge Punisher.<br /><br />Travolta's character and his henchmen are pretty two-dimensional and standard villains but that's ok.  We really don't want to see much development with guys we know are going to end up dead anyway, do we?<br /><br />I was glad to see the film-makers did not give into the urge and have Castle go the romantic route with neighbor Rebecca Romijn Stamos.  The comic character would never let himself get emotionally involved with anyone.<br /><br />The action sequences are done quite well.  My only beef would be perhaps it is a bit too comic-bookish with some of the villians such as the singing hitman from Memphis, and the big Russian played by pro wrestler Kevin Nash.<br /><br />I think these comic-type villians detracted a bit from the edginess of the movie.<br /><br />The DVD has some great extras including commentary, making of doumantery, features on the stunts and even a punisher mini-comic.</p></body></html>

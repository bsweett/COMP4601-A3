<meta name="summary" content="Female Urban Legend Of Marvel Comics"></head><body><p>This is a spin-off from 'Daredevil' as a combination of fantasy and science fiction, with a female "urban legend" of comics who is a lost soul with no place to go, nowhere to turn. That's as close as this movie gets to real life.  As I recall, 'Daredevil' in his red leather outfit donned his disguise to help mankind in his mission to avenge his father's death. In this production of Regency Pictures using Marvel Comics, the female protagonist in her skimpy red outfit is a high paid killer with an analytical mind who seeks to avenge the murder of her mother. Thus, the tables are turned.<br /><br />In this allegory of the ancient war between good and evil, he chose the good, she the evil. She was told by her teacher, a member of the group HAND, that some lessons can't be taught; you must live them to be understood. He is convinced that she is poisoned by hate but has a 'pure' heart.  Terence Stamp made a good leader named aptly 'Stick' who is a holdover from "Daredevil' where he taught the hero how to fight. Here, he does the same for Elektra and later young Abby Miller.  Mark Miller was played by Goran Visnjic of ER fame, a dead-ringer for the young, handsome Robert Downey, Jr., whose star has faded. He was the only character seemingly human. His daugher, 13-yr-old Abby, has a criminal mind and believes the adage that nobody tells the truth about themselves.<br /><br />All humans make mistakes, but these demonic comic-book characters were not human. I have the theory that this movie is not totally fantasy: there are such demons among us in plain sight.  Apparently raised from the dead in 'Daredevil,' she does the same for Abby. She had become emotionally involved with Mark and saw in rebellious Abby the 'young girl she once was.' She knew firsthand that life was not always going to be a bowl of cherries, nor would it turn out to be a bowl of sour grapes either.<br /><br />There are some unusual special effects, and the machinegun violence and weird confrontations were a little much. Tatoo was all snakes, just one of the demonic assassins sent by the Council of the HAND to finish the job Elekta chose not to do and find the 'treasure.' He almost demolished what he was sent to do.  Location shots at a monastery (indoor and outdoors) were lavish. Everything was foreign to me, since I've never read this genre of comic books (I debate the connotation 'comic' in this type of violent illustrated media.) and I was shaken to the core. The director did his job well, as did the actors, but I doubt I will attend this type of production again. To me, comic means something to make you laugh and feel good. This film had the opposite effect.</p></body></html>

Tony Stark is a Mcgyverish, haunted James Bond. If you can picture that blend, great, if not, think highly intelligent and handy with whatever is lying around playboy who has a bit of a heart change after facing death and barely cheating it.<br /><br />From a female point of view, the machines, effects and equipment were cool and not overly technical to the point I lost interest. Techie geeks may have issues with the details, so read a techie focused review if you fit that category. The film clipped along at a fast, tense pace. Plenty of humor, a little love, sarcasm and some skin are tossed in.<br /><br />The language is pretty clean. I either missed some or was caught up enough into the story that it didn't grate against my ears. Downey plays an anti/super-hero like he was born to play it. The film felt comic booky with sharp visuals and colors, and should appeal to the lovers of the comic book films. Bridges gets kudos for his portrayal, as well.<br /><br />Sensitive parents may want to take note of the playboy Stark who has a quick, not too subtle romp with a female reporter. Iron Man is not as squeaky clean as the traditional superhero films (think Peter Parker). Violence isn't gory as much as shoot-em-up. Kids in danger might be frightening for some children and a scene in the car with soldiers is sad and might bother some who have soldiers currently serving.</p></body></html>

As in most trilogies the second movie is often dark and does not reveal all the answers. Look at The Empire Strikes Back, Back to the Future 2, Temple of Doom, Two Towers, or most second films in trilogies.<p><p>Here we find Neo is torn by a personal conflict about Trinity and a vision he has of what will happen to her. When he meets various programmers he begins to understand the complexities and consequences of the programs on the matrix. When he finally meets the creator of the matrix he must decide if he will save the people of Zion or Trinity.<p><p>Any fan of SciFi movies should enjoy this movie. The character development may not be as deep as the first movie but the story development is the key here and takes some close examination to follow.<p><p>I think the movie did a good job of preparing us for the final conflict that will take place in the third movie being released November 11th. The DVD has sharp picture and sound and a number of extras including commentary, documentary and more.</p></body></html>

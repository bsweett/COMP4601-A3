<meta name="summary" content=""Admiral! There be whales here!" A delightfully fresh, offbeat, and grand adventure!"></head><body><p>After the death of Spock and Kirk's son (not to mention the demise of the Enterprise), the tone of the Star Trek films was growing dark. And so, it was definitely time to "lighten up!" It was no wonder that movie goers packed the theatres to see "The Voyage Home", which became the most successful Trek film (so far). It's a film which reaches a wide audience with the message: you don't have to be familiar with all the Trek trappings to enjoy it.<br /><br />Opening with the appearance of a mysterious alien probe--and Kirk & crew preparing to depart Vulcan in their newly-acquired Klingon ship to face the consequences of their actions back on Earth--the probe's transmissions are so overwhelming that any vessel approaching is rendered instantly powerless (and helpless). Once arriving at Earth, the probe "innocently" begins to ionize the atmosphere as it attempts to communicate. But with whom? Spock concludes that the messages are not meant for man, but for whales. And since whales no longer exist in the 23rd century, the crew must risk time travel to find whales in the past and bring them to their own time to respond to the probe before it destroys Earth. (Got all that, so far?)<br /><br />What begins as a serious story turns into a lighthearted "fish-out-of-water" (pardon the pun!) farce once the crew clashes with 20th-century culture, circa 1986, San Francisco. Kirk & Spock soon clash themselves with a whale biologist, Dr. Gillian Taylor, played with feistiness & likability by Catherine Hicks. Hicks blends humor, exasperation, and flirtation in her scenes with Kirk & Spock, as she tries frustratingly to figure out who these odd men are, and why they're so interested in her whales, George & Gracie.<br /><br />As Leonard Nimoy did with "The Search for Spock", he allows each crew member to have some great moments: imagine Checkov wandering the streets of Frisco asking about the "nuclear wessels?" Or McCoy & Scotty tempting a plastics manufacturer with the recipe for transparent aluminum in exchange for materials to build a whale tank? Or Spock administering the Vulcan nerve pinch to an unruly punk rocker on a bus?<br /><br />Nimoy surpasses his previous directorial effort with this one, so fresh & original in its storyline that it's hard to resist. With a strong ecological message at the center---when "man destroys other creatures, he's destroying his future"---Nimoy manages to deliver that message without making it seem heavy-handed.<br /><br />And the Bird of Prey is such a fascinating ship that the absence of the Enterprise was hardly missed. The Bird of Prey is an impressive creation, with the out-stretched neck of a vulture and wings which can move in a "defensive" posture when going in for the kill.<br /><br />As mentioned, there are several subplots happening as each "team" tries to accomplish their task. However, the delightful subplot of Spock attempting to get back in touch with his human side by way of "guesses" and "colorful metaphors" is quite amusing.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best of the series; it belongs next to "The Wrath of Khan" as a fun & satisfying adventure.</p></body></html>

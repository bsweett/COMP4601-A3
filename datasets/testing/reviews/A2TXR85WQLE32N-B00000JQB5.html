<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Renewed"></head><body><p>1999's "The Mummy" is a well-done throw-back to an earlier age of movie-making with its monsters, heroes, and damsels in distress.  The 1932 horror classic featuring Boris Karloff gets a thrilling remake with a strong cast headed by Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Voslo, and John Hannah, much enhanced by the latest in computer-generated imagery.<br /><br />The movie opens with the story of Imhotep (a nicely menacing Arnold Voslo), an Egyptian priest caught by the Pharoah violating one of his concubines.  Imhotep's murder of the Pharoah draws him the horrible living death of entombment in a coffin full of flesh-eating bugs, at Hamanatra, the City of the Dead.<br /><br />The story flashes forward to a French Foreign Legion unit under attack by Arab raiders at the same location a few millenia later. The leader of the Legionaires, an American named Rick O'Connell (played with suitable swagger by Brendan Fraser) survives the massacre and escapes across the desert.<br /><br />The story jumps now to a museum in Cairo, where Evie (played with equal parts brains and klutziness by Rachel Weisz), a female Egyptologist, is researching the mysteries of the now legendary Hamanatra.  Her never-do-well, cowardly, but likeable brother Jonathan (John Hannah) surfaces with an artifact that is the key to the mystery.  The two decide to find the City of the Dead.<br /><br />Rachel hires Rick to guide them across the desert, after first rescuing him from the hangman's noose in a Cairo jail.  The three, accompanied by Rick's erstwhile jailer, travel by river steamer and camel, racing a competing team of archeologists and tracked by a mysterious group of avengers who seek to prevent them from reaching Hamanatra.  At Hamanatra, our heroes uncover the "Book of the Dead" and accidentally resurrect Imhotep.  The stage is set for a wild series of adventures, as Rick, Evie, and Jonathan are pursued back to Cairo by Imhotep, then must follow him back to Hamanatra to rescue Evie.<br /><br />The movie manages to be a nice combination of thrilling action broken up by moments of comedy.  Much of the story is a tongue-in-cheek homage to earlier adventure classics.  If the dialogue is sometimes cliched, the action steps along quickly enough to avoid boring the viewer.  The sets are authentic looking, and the movie score nicely accents the action.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as first rate entertainment.  This DVD version has some nice extra features on the special effects and Egyptology 101.</p></body></html>

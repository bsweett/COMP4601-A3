It has a creative storyline, though the level and frequency of events seem unrealistic.  It still fits the production.  It explores one day in the life of two revengeful men who meet in a freeway after their cars crash one another.  Once Ben Affleck's character says "better luck next time", the thrills begin and don't end until the movie's end.  Samuel L. Jackson wonderfully plays his nemesis.  The other issues involved, including attempted adultry, alcoholism, child care, etc., are expressed wonderfully by every actor.  "Changing Lanes" is a great movie for those who like unique and unpredictable plots.</p></body></html>

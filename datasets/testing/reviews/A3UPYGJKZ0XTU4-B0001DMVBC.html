<meta name="summary" content="Flawless, Affecting Personal Drama."></head><body><p>Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly) is a recovering addict whose home is repossessed for nonpayment of taxes. Massoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley) is a proud Iranian immigrant, once a colonel in the Shah's army, who now struggles to provide a respectable lifestyle for his family. When Behrani purchases Kathy's repossessed home at auction with the intention of reselling it for a profit, he thinks that providence has finally found him. He will be able to own his own home and send his son to college. But the house was improperly seized by the County, and Kathy, who is without any place to live, desperately wants it back. The house is the only thing in her life that Kathy has to cling to. And the house represents a small amount of much-needed prosperity for the Behrani family. This conflict of needs is made worse by Lester (Ron Eldard), a corrupt police officer whom Kathy unwisely relies on in her time of need.<p>"House of Sand and Fog" is based upon the novel of the same name by Andre DuBus III. The film has been flawlessly directed by Vadim Perelman, who also co-wrote the screenplay. This is Perelman's first feature film. He has previously been a commercial director. I must say that this is the strongest debut by a director that I have ever seen. "House of Sand and Fog" is straight drama. The story is a personal one of realistic behavior under unfortunate circumstances. We watch as tragedy unfolds when two people, who are both right in their claim, claim the same thing, and emotions run high. Ben Kingsley is wonderful as the proud and determined Behrani, who has nevertheless been made so vulnerable by leaving behind his life's accomplishments and moving to a foreign country where he has nothing. Kathy is remarkably unsympathetic for a person who has obviously been wronged. But she eventually becomes more sympathetic as she develops some perspective on her situation. Casting Jennifer Connelly in this role meant that the character would be less trashy than in the book. But I think that was a wise decision, considering that Kathy has trouble getting the audience's sympathy as it is. And Jennifer Connelly does a wonderful job here. It is her best work to date. This should establish her as a true acting talent and put rumors that she is just a pretty face to rest. Ron Eldard is also fantastic in his supporting role as Lester, a thoroughly repulsive man, but not an easy one to make believable. Shohreh Aghdashloo is utterly affecting as Massoud Behrani's wife, Nadi, a caring and vivacious woman whose displacement has left her filled with sadness and fear. <p>"House of Sand and Fog" has a slow, contemplative, but even pace. And it's a certain type of film. It exhibits emotions, drama and tragedy on a personal scale. Those who prefer more action or a larger canvas will not like it. But Vadim Perelman has created a masterpiece of personal drama. The performances are outstanding. The cinematography is exquisitely evocative. "House of Sand and Fog" is as good as a film of this type gets. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

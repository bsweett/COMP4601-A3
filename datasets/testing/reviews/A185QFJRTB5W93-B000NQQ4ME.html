However, when people rave about how brutal and violent a movie is, I expect brutal violence.  This film was neither brutal nor violent, considering the context.  It was extremely reserved compared to what it could have been.  I applaud Gibson's dedication to reality and using the original dialect, however, this tactic detracts from being able to adequately develop characters.  This is a film that should have been 90 minutes or 3 hours.  As it was, it should have been 90 minutes of action/drama.  I would have preferred a film that was 3 hours long that presented characters that I actually cared about.  How can I care whether a guy gets his heart cut out, if I don't even know anything about that character?  This film could have been so much more.  I was disappointed.</p></body></html>

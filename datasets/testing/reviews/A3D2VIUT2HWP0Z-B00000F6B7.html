<meta name="summary" content="Montalban: Master of His Domain"></head><body><p>Ever Since I saw the press for this, I have been meaning to get the version here.As for the rating, if this is the Directors cut, then there is no way this should be PG-13;Personally I would like to see more options in these genres for unrated( especially when Adults make the principle purchase).That having been said, I still think that this film is very family friendly, even more so than most news casts.<br />I suspect that most people buying this will know the story, however some may not know that some edits were made, and this cut restores some.Anyways, the film has the most amazingly great audio and video.In 5.1 this film is superb.from start to finish this is a great ride.Wether you have never seen this film before, or if you are wanting the collectors cut, this is a gem.<br />THE DVD.<br />The Commentary.I am always ambivalent about Nicholas Meyers' commentary, however here he has come as close as he seems able to come to a balanced commentary, that is... informative and entertaining.The Second disc extras are great...a bit conflicting ( Shatner now compared to Shatner in 82 with his Attitude about the plot points), and the coverage of the Star Trek Universe... well, I guess Hard Core Trekkies wedge in some-how, and I could care less about that part of the bonus, but thankfully the WRATH OF KHAN is overall a great collection. Hopefully I can complete my set of these DVDs before  the series sells out.</p></body></html>

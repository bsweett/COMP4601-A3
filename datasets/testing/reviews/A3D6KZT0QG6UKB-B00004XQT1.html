<meta name="summary" content="Now I want to read that book"></head><body><p>This was the book that I avoided because it was politically correct to avoid it and as much as I tried to avoid that whole mindset, I was a college student. I also was left unimpressed with Ellis' second &quot;die yuppie scum&quot; novel Rules of Attraction.<p>But after this movie, I gotta go and read it. It's such an evil parody of the vacant yuppie moron, that I couldn't help but love the movie. Work for a Web design startup company with a CFO, CEO, COO or whatever who doesn't know anything and jsut thought that Web design would be a great way to supplement some of the losses from his telemarketing businesses, and you too will love the nastiness heaped upon yuppies by Brett Easton Ellis.<p>A time capsule to when yuppies were considered cool, this young Republican does the things that yuppies do -- obsess over clothing, business cards, restaurant reservations while killing off homeless people and women on a weekly basis. And while Ivan Boesky and Milliken killed people by screwing up their paychecks or funding Contra rebels, Patrick Bateman takes a more hands-on approach.<p>The funniest part of the movie is the music. Huey Lewis, Whitney Houston and the rest of the superficial music is used for maximum effect with Bale giving long lectures on the importance of this music as if it really has any depth. The kill scene to the tune of Seu-seu-sudio cracks me up every time I think of it.<p>At times the movie gets a little too long and repeats the same jokes (how many people have to be killed due to nicer business cards) but it moves along and you forgive it even if it might be about 20 minutes too long.<p>Funny movie, violence is not too terrible, and it's a great way to laugh at yuppies. What's not to recommend?</p></body></html>

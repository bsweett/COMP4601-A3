Because this film has all the trademarks of yet another hackneyed job by Goldsman. He doesn't have a clue how to find grey areas in his characters. They're either good or bad. That's it. He hasn't seen a cinematic cliche he doesn't embrace. That's what's wrong with Ron Howard's film, "Cinderella Man." Apparently, boxer James J. Braddock's life was nothing but a series of cliches. That this film remains partially interesting is due to Russell Crowe's uncanny ability to disappear into a character and Paul Giamatti's sensationally terrfic performance as Braddock trainer, Joe Gould.</p></body></html>

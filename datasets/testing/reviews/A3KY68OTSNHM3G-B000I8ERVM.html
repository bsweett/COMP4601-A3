<meta name="summary" content="A Chilling Movie Based on a True Story"></head><body><p>This frightening and gripping tale is based on a true story of a German student who, in the 1970s, died during an attempted exorcism.  The two German priests who attempted the exorcism were accuded of negligent homicide.  This film is based on the life of a young college student, Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter).  Suffering from horrifying hallucinations and bone-rigid seizures, it was believed that Emily was suffering from some sort of psychosis and epilepsy.  However, the family soon places Emily in the care of their parish priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson).  He has a totally different explanation for Emily's behavior; he believes that she has been possessed by the devil and he plans an exorcism to rid Emily of her demons.<br /><br />However, the exorcism goes terribly awry, and Emily dies during it.  Soon, Father Moore is arrested and accused of negligent homicide.  Scrambling for alternatives, Father Moore's parish hires defense lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) to defend Father Moore.  A up-and-comer in her law firm, she just won a high-profile case before accepting the defense of Father Moore.  One more big victory and she will become a senior partner in her firm.<br /><br />Serving as prosecutor for the trial is Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a church-goer and Sunday School Teacher who believes that religious beliefs are not above the law and intends to prosecute to its fullest extent.  After rejecting a plea deal of reckless endangerment which would have carried a six month jail sentence from the prosecution, the two sides go to trial.<br /><br />The trial is loaded with scientific explanations and religious theories about the cause of Emily's death.  From psychosis and epilepsy to demon possession, many theories are presented by both the prosecution and the defense.  Which side will the jury believe?  Will Father Moore be found guilty or innocent?<br /><br />I found this movie to be extremely exciting to watch.  The trial scenes are riveting, and the cut-away scenes showing Emily fighting her condition are the high points of the movie.  The acting is first-rate.  Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott, and especially Jennifer Carpenter as the torn and troubled Emily are all excellent in their roles.  If you remember seeing "The Exorcist", this movie will scare you even more.  I highly recommend this movie.  The courtroom drama will draw you in, and the exorcism and possession scenes will keep you glued to the screen throughout.  Watch this true story and see how possession, scientific theory, and exorcism meet head-on in a clash of beliefs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Ultimate in Alien Terror."></head><body><p>Director John Carpenter's favorite film as a kid was Howard Hawks "The Thing". After the success of Halloween, and The Fog, big studios wanted him. Universal studios gave him a ton of money to remake his favorite film, not only does he update it, he blows you away with visuals and fx that has never been seen at the time. Too bad this film was released the same time as the family oriented E.T., it would have done better, but that stupid candy eating creature had the whole world's attention. I am not knocking E.T., but this is an adult film, made to scare you to death. It delivers. The fx is incrdible, the then 22 year old Rob Bottin, (fx genious), is fantastic. The defibrillation scene is my personal best. UNBELIEVABLE STUFF. Kurt Russell plays his part to the best. Guessing who is and isn't infected keeps you on the edge of the seat. Ennio Morricone's score, (synthesizer), is brilliant and downright spooky. This is one creepy and eyepoping film, Carpenter is God in the Horror genre. Flip the lights off, grab a loved one and be prepared to be astonished, I was.</p></body></html>

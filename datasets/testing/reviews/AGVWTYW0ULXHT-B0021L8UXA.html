<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining but predictable zombie-type thriller, with decent performances, a few clever scenes, but unclever dialogue"></head><body><p>This relatively small-scale remake of George Romero's low-budget thriller manages to deliver a few thrills, here and there, but never manages to do much that is truly inventive or original, and certainly never manages to convince me that a remake of the ultra low-budget original was necessary.  When the local drunk goes crazy with a gun at the local ballpark, and an ordinary man goes bonkers and burns his house down with the family locked inside, the local sheriff begins to suspect a pattern.  When a downed airplane is discovered in the local water supply, he figures out, connecting the dots perhaps too quickly to leave us in suspense, there must have been some kind of contaminant aboard.  Of course we know already the military's involved because from the first scene we have been shown that every significant "crazy" event has been monitored by satellite and other military surveillance.  The first thing that bugged me about the remake is that what's happening is so easily explained, early on, as the result of a military experiment gone awry.  Of course we don't yet know the details, but the thrill of discovery is denied us.  (I don't consider that a spoiler, since the premise of the film is familiar, and I'm only saying that the film gives away too much too soon - in a way, I'm saying the film itself spoiled a lot of what could have been interesting about it, too early on.)<br /><br />For example, one intriguing element the film touches upon but never develops, is that the "craziness" alluded to in the title might in some instances just be an extreme version of the (perhaps) ordinarily bizarre and slightly psychopathic behavior of small-town disorderliness, the kind of minor illegality and extremism that a sane sheriff would know well enough to overlook for the most part.  (For a more original film that explores the possibility that small town extremism and psychopathia might border upon each other, see the very cool Canadian zombie flick <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TZS5G0">Pontypool</a>).  Drunken disorderliness turned vicious, for example, or the local poachers, who take advantage of the chaos to hunt some unconventional "game."  The cool thing about the premise is that these aren't zombies - they're not dead and they're not mindless - but the virus turns them into psychopathic versions of themselves, themselves without a conscience and with an impulse to hurt.  This version didn't explore or exploit that dimension as much as it could have.  I think it would have been much more effective to keep things unexplained and play up this element a bit longer, so that for a day or two you let Tim Olyphant as sheriff actually try to figure this out and let Radha Mitchell as his wife and local doctor come up with theories until they're over their heads and the escalation of ordinary people's everyday quirks into violence can no longer be explained away.  Only then would reinforcements come and only then would it become clear what they're dealing with and only then would it become clear that the military was aware.  I liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010X745K">The Mist</a> better, where the local craziness was the focus at first and only late in the game did the larger stakes become clear.<br /><br />The performances were satisfactory, but the lines they spoke tended to be the product of mostly uninspired writing.  They said the obvious things, or voiced the emotional content of scenes that should have (and usually were) already been carried by the acting and the editing.  The one character who really stood out for me was that of Joe Anderson, the Deputy who easily upstaged Tim Olyphant in every scene they shared, especially as the situation went from bad to much worse.  I'd never seen him in anything before, but after this I'm convinced he could easily carry a film and will look for his future work.  The editing and look was fine, and the filmmakers had obviously seen a lot of horror films and borrowed liberally from the most intense moments (e.g. a guy drags a pitchfork that you know he's going to use to inflict violence, and the sound itself is both grating and horrifying - and which is, depending on how you look at it, a pretty direct steal from or homage to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B1UO7G">Blood Simple</a>). On the other hand, there are a few fresh images here that had my heart pumping and my eyes intrigued - a scene in a car wash comes to mind, that was richly executed.  The ending was utterly predictable.  My wife predicted it about ten minutes into the film.  Still, it's not bad and could have been much worse.  Not bad, but not likely to attain classic status.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Suspenseful thriller,one of Pollacks best"></head><body><p>The Interpreter(released Apr/05)stars Nicole Kidman as the titled interpreter Silvia Broome,Sean Penn as secret service agent Tobin Kellar,along with a nice supporting cast.The film pulls you in from the start and Pollack is on game,revealing plot elements like pieces in a puzzle;with a very pleasing but different end result.<br />The film opens in Matobo,a fictional African country,full of strife and internal violence,run by its dictator Edmond Zuwanie(Earl Cameron).Three people drive up to an old stadium,in disrepair, for a rendezvous;one is a black interpreter,one is Kidman's brother Simon and one is a friend of Simon and Kidman's,Phillippe,a photgrapher,who arranged the meeting.Phillippe stays behind in the vehicle as the other two enter the stadium.They find three young boys playing soccer and one of them leads the two men under the stadium to view several dead bodies,from a recent massacre.After a few moments the boy yells to the men that someone is coming.As they rush out they are confronted with the boys who now are armed.The two men are shot dead.Phillippe hears the shots,as one of Zuwanie's men drive up.Phillippe hides,then flees the country.<br />Back in the States we start to follow the life of interpreter Kidman,who works at the UN.One day an evacuation is called in the building,and all personnel leave.Kidman,who forgot her satchel,returns to her office to retrieve it and hears some chatter on her headphones.It is a conversation about the killing of the teacher(Zuwanie),who is coming to speak at the UN.As she listens the lights in her room come on and she frantically switches them off,but the voices appear to know she is there and she flees.The next day she reports what she heard and secret service man Penn and company show up.In short time he/they doubt her story and she goes through a battery of testing and interrogation.They cannot shake her story,as she is adamant about what she heard and its intent.We learn Kidman is originally from Motabo and her sister and parents were killed there,years before.She took up arms briefly with her brother,but left after killing a young boy,who was about to kill her.<br />As the film progresses,Kidman is being followed and fears for her life.In fact an intruder enters her apartment,taking a mask,then appearing on the outside fire escape and running off.That man leaves behind a trace of hair and a Motaboan killer,the same one seen outside the stadium where her brother got killed,appears and snuffs out his underling for his sloppiness.Kidman knows of a  rival of Zuwanies in New York,Kuman-Kuman(George Harris).She meets him on a bus,accusing him of much of the violence in her home country.He denies the charges and says he will see what he can find out about her brother.In the meantime,the Motabaon killer has come on board with a satchel in hand,along with one secret service agent following Kidman and another following the killer.It's a cozy set up until Penn asks his men via radio ear buds,whether the man is carrying anything.Penn and his associates have found the killers victim and some explosives.When the killer gets off it first appears that he has taken everything with him.Penn tells his men to get off,Kidman and one agent do,as a woman finds what she says is a lunch bag the killer left behind.In seconds the bus blows up,killing many aboard,including the agent and Kuman-Kuman and his entourage,along with others on the street.<br />The day of Zuwanies speech comes and Kidman is taking a shower,at least that is what Penn thinks;as he and his colleagues have been sitting across the street monitoring her room and activities.However she leaves the shower water running and escapes out the bathroom window.She goes to the UN and waits in a safe room,the place in which she figures Zuwanie will be taken to,if anything should happen.The scene switches to the UN where all precautions have been taken inside and out,as Penn suspects this is going to be a suicide bomber,and the bomb,he thinks,is already in the UN.As Zuwanie stands before the UN giving his speech a hitman has entered the sound control booth and he is putting together a rifle.Penns hunch was wrong but when he spies a hole cut in the booth glass,pieces of the puzzle come together in his head and in short order, is quickly climbing the stairs.I won`t reveal the ending as such,but it brings together alot of the puzzle that Pollock has laid out before us through the films progression.The ending is bittersweet also,but a fitting one.<br />Pollock himself appears a few times in this film as Penn`s boss and did a great job(not the first time he`s appeared in films,either his own or someone elses).After that shooting takes place in the opening scenes Pollock has our attention straight away.From then on we switch to the States and the puzzle and its pieces are laid out bit by bit, building on one another.Pollock weaves a compelling tale and the climax is quite the culmination of layers of many elements.Smart,well presented and edited,this is definitely one of my favourite Pollock films.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include deleted scenes,an alternate ending,three featurettes and a short on Pollock discussing widescreen vs Pan and Scan.The latter I watched and it should be mandatory viewing for all movie goers and watchers,especially the home bound crowd.It also should be mandatory viewing for ANYONE involved in the distribution of movies,in any capacity.<br />All in all an excellent and engrossing tale about African corruption and violence,coming to US soil and its ultimate consequences.Pollock,along with his two main stars do a bang up job throughout.4-4 1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

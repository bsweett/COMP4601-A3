<meta name="summary" content="A Thrill A Second!"></head><body><p>This will be another classic movie done by Steven Speilberg. Jones is approached by federal government representatives to help locate the Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis (Hitler) are also looking for the Ark. Jones starts  out on his mission in search of the prize. He goes through several near  death scenarios before ending up in the desert. There the Ark is found by  Jones and his small crew. They are in turn captured by the Nazis. All of  this leads up to the exciting ending. The Nazis get the final shock opf  their lives when they open up the  Ark. A very good ending to a very good  movie. This movie is very picturesque with the use of the desert scenes.  Like I said before a classic.</p></body></html>

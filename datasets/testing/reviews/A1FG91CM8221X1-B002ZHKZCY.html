This sequel to "The Bourne Identity" has Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) out to clear his name and save his own life after being framed for the murder of two CIA operatives in Berlin. Racing across India, Berlin and Moscow, Bourne does battle with a murderous assassin (Karl Urban, unrecognizable from his turn as the noble warrior Eomer in "The Lord of the Rings") and two squabbling CIA division chiefs (Joan Allen, Brian Cox). There are car chases, shootings and stunts galore, and Greengrass doesn't miss a trick in keeping the film moving at breakneck speed. Damon, all traces of his "Good Will Hunting" baby fat gone, is a thoroughly believable action hero, and the rest of the cast--particularly Allen and Cox--is quite fine. Like a ride on a particularly slick rollercoaster, "The Bourne Supremacy" is a fine way to pass the time on a lazy summer day.</p></body></html>

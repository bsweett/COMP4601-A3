<meta name="summary" content="One day over and over with Andie MacDowell?"></head><body><p>Life could be MUCH worse.  Embittered weatherman Murray takes on small town Pennsylvania, covering groundhog day with his new boss MacDowell and creepy camera-guy Chris Elliot (in one of his few understated and enjoyable roles).  This comedy came in under the radar-it was not a big hit, but it has the stars and script that should have made it one.  Bill Murray is PERFECT for this part, and any collection of his classic film lines, from GHOSTBUSTERS and CADDYSHACK thru the present would have to include at least a couple of the following from this film:<p>&quot;I'm guessing March 22nd.&quot;<br />&quot;I'd love to stay and talk...but I'm not going to.&quot;<br />&quot;I'm BOTH!  I'm a celebrity in an emergency!&quot;<br />&quot;Yeah, they're hicks Rita.&quot;<br />&quot;Morons!  Your bus is leaving.&quot;<br />&quot;Well what if there IS NO TOMORROW!?  THERE WASN'T TODAY!  Hello?&quot;<p>I can't say much for the special edition treatment-there isn't really anything here to speak of.  Commentary is nice, but it's obvious that not too much time or effort was put into this.  The film looks good and sounds good and that's all I really care about.  If you have passed over this film year after year in the video store-try it.  It takes a hardened man and redeems him by the end!  Very uplifting and funny.</p></body></html>

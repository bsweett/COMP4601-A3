<meta name="summary" content="A twisted plot is not the only problem"></head><body><p>The style and the camera movement of the movie is very good. However, the plot is nigh incomprehensible. The main character keeps get flashbacks and has a miracously ability to put all the pieces together with the small pieces of information. I kept thinking, "Yes, but how in the world did he figure out where ...?" Some mysteries like the "Big Sleep" can overcome incomprehensible plots, but these mysteries need a strong lead like Bogart. Unfortunately, Hartnett does not carry the film. He's ok, but he can't carry all the deadweight of the plot. Swank seems to be channeling both Bette Davis and Harlowe at the same time. Johanssen has a very strange character.<br /><br />The movie was disappointing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GORGEOUS TRANSFER!!! HDTV AT ITS BEST!!!"></head><body><p>Is this what we were all waiting for??<br /><br />YES!!!<br /><br />Incredible image. Crisp. Rich. Full of detail. Incredible contrast. Amazing colors. This is exactly what HDTV is all about.<br /><br />HD-DVD really got me. I was once a Blu-ray supporter, but now I've got to admit. HD-DVD is simply doing what it was suposed to do: DELIVER!<br /><br />This HD-DVD have all the extras we find on the regular DVD. How great can it get? Shame on Blu-ray!<br /><br />Just give me more HD-DVD movies! I can't get enough of it.</p></body></html>

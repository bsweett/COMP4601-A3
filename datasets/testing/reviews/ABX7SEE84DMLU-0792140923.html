<meta name="summary" content="Run, Forrest, Run"></head><body><p>The movie is about the legitimate and profound power of optimism, persistence and character.  Those themes are timeless and probably expressed better in this film than any other of the last twenty years.<br /><br />On first and on last viewing, though, I was disconcerted by the "run, Forrest, run" motif.  The moral message seemed to be that there are circumstances where we should just run from adversity.  This is first shown where a truckload of young men are chasing teenage Forrest in Alabama, throwing rocks, etc.  Robin Wright shouts at him to run, and, since she's the one who tells him to run, he runs.<br /><br />Of course, Forrest's running later leads to repeated heroism.  But I was still a little thrown off by this, because we're not always supposed to run, are we?<br /><br />Well, you never know exactly what you're going to get.  I guess sometimes the wisest thing to do is run rather than stand and get killed.<br /><br />If Forrest were now in Iraq instead of Viet Nam, what would he do?</p></body></html>

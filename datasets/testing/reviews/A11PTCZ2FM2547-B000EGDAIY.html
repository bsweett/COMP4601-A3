<meta name="summary" content="Effectively Creepy"></head><body><p>Horror movies are effective when they're not so. . .horrifying.  Show me a Hamburger Helper gore-fest and I'll get downright bored; there's only so many ways to skin a cat (pardon the pun), plus the viewer, after awhile, becomes completely desensitized to all the blood 'n guts.  There's something to be said about things that go bump in the night; if a scary flick is to be effective, there needs to be suspense, a little campy creepiness, and a fleeting glimpse of a monster screaming, "Boo!"<br /><br />Enter THE GRUDGE, director Takashi Shimizu's American remake of his Japanese thriller, "Ju-on."  I thoroughly enjoyed this yarn precisely because Shimizu didn't try to gross his audience out; instead, we catch glimpses and haunting images of three demons who terrorize a house. . .and anyone who dares to enter it.  Accordingly, actual violence is kept to a minimum; shots of ghosts only last long enough to tweak the "ick" nerve, and the viewer never, ever, witnesses a victim endure a long, agonizing death.<br /><br />And that, folks, makes for effective horror.<br /><br />The mostly American cast is adequate, yet not memorable.  Sarah Michelle Gellar as an American nurse-in-training abroad in Tokyo--and subsequently tormented by messy ghouls--is okay, although she often seems aloof and disinterested.  Other American actors include Bill Pullman, who gets this movie rolling right along.  The ending, like most horror flicks, is pretty lame, yet THE GRUDGE works effectively via creepiness--not chainsaws.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

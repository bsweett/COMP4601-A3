It doesn't waste it's time with long stretches of dialogue.  It cuts right to the action.  It doesn't linger on, at only 90 minutes.  I liked the medusa scenes and especially the creature battle at the conclusion. If you liked the original, you'll certainly like this version too.  I noticed the actor Pete Postlethwaite looks like he's plays Perseus's father. He puts in a good performance that grounds the movie.<br /><br />The extras present a few good cut scenes that were good but would have otherwise dragged down the film.  If you can buy it for under $10, it's well worth it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If you have the name Sarah Connor, RUN!"></head><body><p>Tripping, dude in real life is pumping iron and winning Mr. Universe awards, beating out that Ferrigno guy that played the Hulk.  Then he plays this cyborg dude that comes to Earth to kill off a lady whose son will lead a future revolution against the Robots.  Yeah I know you are thinking dang, Bill Gates was probably in on this!  No, he was not but Linda Hamilton rox yo world as Sara Connor, now you can spell that Sarah Conner or Sara Connor or whatever, I don't care.  What I do care about is that this film really opens the eyes to a bad dude.  This dude has red eyes and he gave a whole new attitude in 1984 when he had one ripped out, shrugged and simply donned some blades.  Yeah black leather jackets as well.  Oh man and then he just starts ripping up this police station!<br /><br />Well c'mon, not very realistic.  Sure you can have cyborgs come here and do stuff, they do all the time but usually they are just in Vegas playing the odds while on a stopover from Venus.  Okay the worst part is this...a waitress from Los Angeles suddenly becomes the cops main concern?  Yeah right that did not happen in the whole O.J. deal now did it?  Real life this lady would not have made it and by the time the cops even had gotten hot on the trail, the Terminator would have been jumping around time warps so much his head would be spinning!<br /><br />Classic Sci-Fi starring Arnie, who is now a Guv-nah but still pumps iron.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well-done, but a bit slow."></head><body><p>Summary:<br />Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an ex-beauty queen with three children, two ex-husbands, no job, and no job skills. The movie begins with Erin flubbing a job interview and getting in an accident. She hires Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to sue the other driver. When Ed loses the case Erin demands he give her a job. He does and when she takes a personal interest in a pro bono case that turns out to be a major civil suite, Ed and Erin push it through to victory landing a multi-million dollar settlement against Pacific Gas and Electric. Though Erin isn't a legal expert, she is a people person and it's through her efforts that the case is really won.<p>My Comments:<br />The movie isn't particularly quick, suspenseful, or exciting, but it is remarkably well-produced. The cinematography is great; some of the scenes are even shot in Hinkley, CA, giving the movie a very authentic feel. Ed, Erin, and George (Aaron Eckhart) - the three main actors - are great and well-portrayed.<p>I felt like I was left not knowing what turns out with George, Erin's boyfriend, and there is only one scene of Erin informing people of the court's decision. Too much time was spent on Erin collecting plaintiffs in Hinkley and not enough on her relationship with George and her kids, unless, of course, she really was incredibly neglectful of her family and friends.<p>I'm doing my best to not comment on the story itself, because it is a true story, but I couldn't help but see Erin as an annoying pain. Perhaps that means Julia Roberts did a good job, nevertheless, I wouldn't mind avoiding someone as caustic as Erin was portrayed in my personal life.<p>Overall, the movie is entertaining and well done with just a few flaws. If you like Julia Roberts or legal films, you'll probably enjoy this film. Otherwise, you might find it a bit boring.</p></body></html>

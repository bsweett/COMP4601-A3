With dark/downtrodden sets, many camera angles, and a whole lot of action, this movie keeps you in suspense.  With a pseudo-historical basis, this movie is set in old london, where 2 young magicians lives start off as friends, but by a "Knot it time" they are split apart and apposed to each other until the end.  It is a very original movie, I have not seen anyting based around a subject like this before, or at least recently.  Check this movie out if you like films like Batman Begins, American Psycho, The Machienist, ect...all of which starred Christian Bale.  Again, casting was excellent in this film with Bale, Jackman, Caine, Johansen, Hall, and Perabo.  Also the very improtant spot of Nikola Tesla was filled by DAVID BOWIE, which was a great role for him, and his dark, proper, and mysterious character.  Check this movie out, well worth the price of admission.</p></body></html>

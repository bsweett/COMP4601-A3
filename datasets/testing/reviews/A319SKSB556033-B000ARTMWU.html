<meta name="summary" content="Recycled clich&eacute;s in a somewhat entertaining order"></head><body><p>High Tension offers nothing new to the slasher movie genre. It's nothing more than a succession of set-pieces manipulated to provoke maximum dread from the audience. Everything you've seen before, but the relentless gore, superb photography and eerie, minimalist atmosphere make it a decent time-waster and probably one to share with all your pals.<br /><br />Marie and Alex are 2 college girls vacationing at Alex's parents house in the country. Marie is given her own room and seems comfortable sleeping on her lonesome despite feeling a little unnerved by the isolation of the farmhouse. Not long after nightfall a stranger in grubby cover-alls pulls up in his rust-bucket van/tank and sets about murdering Alex's dad, mum and brother. He kidnap's Alex and plans to rape, torture and kill her but Marie is hot on his heels. Can she rescue her in time.<br /><br />For most of the running time this film works purely on eager energy but in the last act, when the director has wrung out everything he can from the clich&eacute;-ridden script he chucks in a stupid, ridiculous plot twist that completely contradicts everything established in the opening act. Yes, there are clues and hints that limply tie it together but it still doesn't add up to sense.<br /><br />I saw Wolf Creek recently and found it rather dull. Upon reading a lot of reviews of it I was made aware of many people comparing it to High Tension, which is what made me check it out in the first place. Yes, the films are very similar but High Tension is surely the best of the 2, no matter how dumb it gets at the end.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with badly dubbed in English DD 5.1 sound. Watch it in French with the subs on.</p></body></html>

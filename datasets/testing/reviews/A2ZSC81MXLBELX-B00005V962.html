I didnt even want to watch it at first, but my son bought it and I was looking for something I hadn't seen yet, so okay okay let's give a try.<br />What a ride! I really liked it! Danny Ocean played by George Clooney had a fresh new look and the story had a fresh new take. The basic idea was the same as the original, a parolee and his 11 buddies(including the likes of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Don Cheadle) all with special talents that are put to use to do the unthinkable... rob 3 of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas, which by all the experts is considered virtually impossible. In this new version though, we are much more technologicaly advanced in the tools of this trade, so it's more like a comedic Mission Impossible.<br />All 3 Casinos they want to rob are all owned by the same man (Andy Garcia), who (Uh Oh the plot thickens here) happens to be dating Ocean's ex-wife(Julia Roberts). So did Danny Ocean engineer this elaborate heist just for the $150 million they stood to gain or did he have other motives? You decide!<br />The cast also includes Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck,Scott Caan, and for those who still need a touch of nostalgia we get Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould in the mix. The whole cast does a really good job of bringing their own take on these characters, and Director Steven Soderbergh(Erin Brochovich, Traffic) has given a new stylish look at this story.<br />The DVD was enjoyable to watch, The widescreen, the sound,(Dolbly Dig 5.1) picture, all were exceptional. The cinematography has to be seen to be appreciated. For those in need of Special Features you get some pretty good ones. Commentary from the stars and the Director, Behind the Scenes Making of the Movie,and Theatrical Trailers.<br />So I was debating on 3 stars or 4 ( I would've gone 3 1/2 if I could've) I went with 3 because like "Mr. Toad"s Wild Ride" at Disneyland it was alot of fun but I Probably wont go back on again right away. If you havn't seen it I suggest renting it first.  It should be seen at least once though, even if you think a "remake" of this film can't be good. And by the way If you have not seen the original check it out, it stands the test of time.<br />have fun..Laurie</p></body></html>

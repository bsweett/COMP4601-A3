<meta name="summary" content="How to make a typical epic feature"></head><body><p>To make an epic feature, first you need a historical character.  Choose a king, or a tyrant, and be prepared to show him as both beloved of the people, and disliked for his mistakes, usually the mistakes that come from the Shakespearian tragic hero conceit of having too much pride (hubris) or being too driven on a certain goal that he neglects other important aspects of rulership.<br /><br />Secondly, you need beautiful people to fill predominant roles.  Choose someone like Colin Farrell, since he's popular, and Angelina Jolie for a seductress.  Choose Jared Leto to be a pretty boy and Rosario Dawson for the historical character's wife.  Then fill all of the extras and back-up roles with ugly fat men and maybe the occassional ethnic woman or two.<br /><br />About the dialog, there are three types: first... there's the dramatic whisper...which you put pauses in between each clause... and then inflex the voice down at the end; secondlythere'sthesomewhatloudbutfastpacedmediumdialog that ends with each word carefully accented; THIRDLY EVERYONE MUST YELL AT EACHOTHER IMPORTANTLY!  Important scenes should contain transitions between all three types.<br /><br />No epic feature should ever be less than 2 hours and 15 minutes long.  Include long marches and sand-and-sandal imagery.  Have slow, whispery dialog speeches that last ten minutes.  Include epic battle scenes that contain about a thousand aerial shots of armies clashing cross-cut with close-ups of people screaming with the occassional sudden cut of two bodies running into each other and falling down.<br /><br />And the most important thing you need to do to make a typical epic feature: at any point it seems the story might be able to end, make something happen just to make quite clear to the audience that the end is never, ever coming.<br /><br />Those are the rules Oliver Stone adhered to in order to put some meat, so to speak, on his analysis of the conquerer Alexander the Great.  I can see what he wanted to do... too bad he left all the important stuff to a five minute battle about two and half hours into the film.  The rest of it was just kind of filler space,  with the only seemingly inherent interest being the homosexuality.  I think he put that in there just so that people'd have something to talk about before the climactic battle at the end.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></body></html>

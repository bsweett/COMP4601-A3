<meta name="summary" content="A RIVITING AND THOUGHT PROVOKING WAR FILM!"></head><body><p>Not since 'Platoon' has another war picture put the viewer inside a soldiers head and in the heart of the action. 'The Hurt Locker' is more about the man inside the uniform than just another patriotic war piece. Jeremy Renner who I have only seen in a few films does a fantastic job as an adrenaline junkie bomb disarmer who's taste for deadly excitement has more than one of his squad a little nervous. This could have been a ridiculous "Hollywood" film, but instead becomes a psychological study of what it takes to do this kind of thing on a daily basis.<br /><br />This is one of the best war films I've seen in a long time and is well worth your time. 'The Hurt Locker' delivers in spades!</p></body></html>

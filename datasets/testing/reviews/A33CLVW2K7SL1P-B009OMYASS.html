Hostel seems like a paragon compared to Cabin Fever.<br /><br />The story by now is well known. Three randy young men - two from the U.S. and one from Iceland - are traveling together. Well, actually, *two* randy young men are traveling with a third young man who just lost his girlfriend and, although young men in general want to get it on all the time (so the film would have us believe) he is, at first, less interested in sex and more hurt by his recent loss.<br /><br />The friends hear of a place in Slovakia where beautiful girls will do anything that men want them to - especially Americans. This, of course, begins a trek from Amsterdam to the city in Slovakia that holds such promise. This isn't remotely believable, unless we assume all three characters to be idiots. Travel hundreds of miles for something they're likely to get (sex) where they are? Let's not forget that they're in Amsterdam, not Mayberry (Andy Griffith Show).<br /><br />But they do, for what would the movie be without said trip?<br /><br />They arrive in a very war beaten town (that would have made me leave immediately - it was creepy and devoid of life), and take up lodging in a co-ed hotel. Lucky for them, their roommates are attracted to them, and they end up getting it on together. Unlucky for them, these girls are Sirens.<br /><br />Oli (the Icelander) is the first to disappear, and the other friends are first confused, and then puzzled when they receive a photo from his cell phone depicting Oli and another girl with largely lifeless looks on their face.<br /><br />Josh (Harry from Dumb and Dumberer) is the next to disappear, and instead of mystery, we are taken directly to where the action is, so to speak. Josh finds himself securely handcuffed to a chair, and a man with little to no remorse (who wanted to be a surgeon but wasn't allowed to) begins to torture him. Without the blink of an eye, or a hint of hesitation, this man (someone the boys oddly encountered on a train - unbelievable) takes a rather long and large drillbit, and drills a hole in his leg, then his chest, etc. etc.<br /><br />Flash back to Jay (Friday Night Lights), who survived the "Siren song" only because he passed out in a janitor's closet after being drugged instead of the bathroom. His survival leads us into a house of horrors as revolting as anything we've ever seen. To Roth's credit, there are "rules" or regulations here. It isn't just a chop shop. It's art that people pay to see, and people pay to see Americans more than any others. That's a nice slap in our face, and perhaps a deserved one, seeing as we are generally disliked the world over at this point in our history.<br /><br />What happens after Jay enters the chop shop is, again, believable within the parameters of the world Roth has created, and the ending is very satisfying.<br /><br />There is another Hostel in the making. This film cost 4.5m to make, and grossed 47m in the U.S., also doing well in the international market. To gross 10x what it cost to make the film means it was a success, so Hostel II isn't much of a surprise. It will be interesting to see how well Roth does this time around - if he's learned as much as he did from the making of Cabin Fever, and if Hostel II is that much better than Hostel.</p></body></html>

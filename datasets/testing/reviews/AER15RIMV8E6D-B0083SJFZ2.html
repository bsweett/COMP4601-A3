<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Epic!!!"></head><body><p>I thought this was a very decent remake and great tribute to the 1981 classic. I loved the special effects, the action, and the suspense. Some things are different than the original, but it still has the same basic storyline. The human son of Zeus, Perseus loses his family because of Hades. When Hades threatens the city of Argos by releasing the Kraken, Perseus and his team decides to seek the Stygian Witches in hopes of figuring out a way to kill the Kraken. Along the way, they must deal with giant scorpions, befriend a race of Djinn, and try kill Medusa. If you love epics and Greek mythology, you will love CLASH OF THE TITANS!!!</p></body></html>

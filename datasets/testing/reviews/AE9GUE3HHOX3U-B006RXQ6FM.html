Her character is similar to the character she played in "The Devil Wears Prada" given they are both total beotches.  There was alot of symbolism in this film with the lights going on and off and the constant interuptions that took place whenever they were discussing something serious.  I can't figure out what they meant but I know they meant something. Technically,  I loved the way Doubt was filmed and I liked the colours they used, the cinematography was excellent. I also enjoyed the costumes.  Story wise, there were alot of unanswered questions throughout the film but I guess it was intentional considering the subject matter of the film, "doubt".  I didn't really like the ending of the film, I wanted to find out if Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character really did have inappropriate relations with Donald.  He sort of skirted around the issue and never really admitted to anything but i guess this was also intentional for the sake of suspense and mystery.  I thought the film should have been longer and a bit more detail oriented with some of the characters.  The very last scene when Sister Alyosious says she has "doubts", I didn't fully understand what she meant.  Does she have doubts about the father, does she have doubts about her faith and God?  I guess I'm the type of person who wants some things spelled out for me.</p></body></html>

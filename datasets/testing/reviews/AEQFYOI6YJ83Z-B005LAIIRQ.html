<meta name="summary" content="A surprisingly deep, unnverving thriller."></head><body><p>If Hollywood has taught us anything, it's that you want Liam Neeson on your side in a tough situation.  The man can do anything: travel halfway across the world to rescue his daughter; train a Jedi master, a Sith lord, AND Batman; even lead a Scottish revolution.  What, you may be thinking, could a plane crash possibly do to Mr. Neeson?  Ruffle his hair?<br /><br />Indeed, Neeson and his fellow actors walk away from the plane crash...into the jaws of some very hungry, very demonic wolves.  Sound improbable?  It is.  And that's part of the fun.  Because THE GREY isn't an action film.  It was marketed as such, and as you can judge from many of the reviews, this was the viewpoint a lot of people took when watching it.  But THE GREY is more of an existential survivalist film.  These wolves aren't really wolves--they don't look like wolves, they don't behave like wolves.  The plane crash, beautiful though it is on film, isn't very realistic.  The fact that Neeson's character just happens to be a man paid to kill wolves?  Yeah.<br /><br />But Joe Carnahan does what most filmmakers wouldn't dare: he uses the absurdity to tell a bigger, more meaningful story.  Years from now, when people are debating whether or not Carnahan is a good filmmaker, the "pro" side will put forth THE GREY as their proof.  It is beautifully shot--the wolves are achingly rendered, shadowy creatures whose minimal appearance reflects the overall ambiguity of the film.  (Their attacks are effectively brutal while presenting a minimum level of gore.)  The afore-mentioned crash is stunning, and the various small action sequences are tightly drawn.  This is truly a film to be watched--the special effects, combined with the cinematography, and the actors' rugged appearances, makes it hard for one's eyes to wander.<br /><br />THE GREY isn't without its flaws.  It's slow in spots, and has a few weaker moments--hence the 4 stars.  But when it hits, it hits true, making it that rare film that defies expectations, bends genre conventions, and becomes something truly different.  An accidental hit, you might like to call it--or possibly the proof that there is a great filmmaker lurking within Joe Carnahan's imagination.</p></body></html>

Watching the surprisingly realistic computer animation, it raises the question, "Why don't we make ALL our superhero movies this way?"  Let's face it, the special effects in "live-action" films are just as computer-generated as these.  Watch the way Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) creates an ice-slide.  Will Iceman (of the X-Men) ever be able to do something similar in a live-action film.  The whole look of the film is terrific - capturing the feel, the architecture, and the look of golden-era comic books.  Personally, I usually find computer-generated humans to be a bit creepy, but this film is successful because it eschews realism in favor or caricature for its characters.<br /><br />The story is as funny as any animated feature I've seen: superheroes are forced to retire and adjust to civilian life.  Of course, that can't last forever and The Incredibles come out of hiding.  The funniest character turns out to be a fashion designer who answers the question, "Where do superheroes get their costumes from?"<br /><br />The film is much more grown-up than one would expect - especially about violence.  Elastigirl tells her children:  "You know those cartoons you used to watch on Saturday morning?  This isn't like that.  These people won't show restraint just because you are children - they will kill you if they get the chance."  It is because of the seriousness of some of the violence that this picture isn't suitable for the very little.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I AM LEGEND on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>I have owned the two disc Special Edition which is in Standard Def for some time.  It includes a Digital Copy which tells you to insert the 2nd disc into your PC, select Digital Copy from the menu and enter an authorization code included inside the cover.  Maybe this doesn't work on Macs but I don't get a Digital Copy menu when I insert the disc into my Mac Pro.  Maybe someone can advise me on how to do this properly other than by ripping it with Handbrake or some similar software,<br /><br />Okay, got that request out of the way so here is the Blu Ray review which only focuses on the quality of the Blu Ray transfer, both audio and video.  No acting critiques, plot summaries or evaluations of the practicality of this event occurring or CGI effects. (The male lion doesn't quite make it IMHO)  Not sure which I like better, the theatrical or alternate release, both put a different spin on things and both are fine.<br /><br />The Standard Def version was really quite good, the Blu Ray's audio tops it for clarity if not directionality and making full use of your complete sound system.  The original audio editing was top notch.  There is a definite improvement with the Blu Ray which contains both the theatrical and alternate releases of the film but since the regular DVD was as good as it was in the audio editing, the improvement does not make for a night and day comparison.  It is lossless audio and that is about the best you're going to get it.  The opening scenes really envelope you in the sight and sounds of the stricken city.<br /><br />The video transfer is equally excellent with sharp contrast and wonderful color saturation when appropriate.  The dark scenes looked a touch crushed in the blacks to me but detail was still there, no question about it.  I saw no grain even in the darkest of scenes.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thanks.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty disappointing"></head><body><p>The nothingness of this film was painful. It had amazing promise that just fell flat. The actors were good, except the woman who played Wahlberg's wife was pretty miscast. The storyline and plot were close to  horrible.  No believable scientific explanations, a vague message of a warning, but really a lot of ambivalence and lack of passion. I was offended at the portrayal of those who lived out in the lonely countryside first as killers and then as insane wicked people. Very narrow-minded view and negative toward people who live in the country. The film neither inspires us nor frightens us. Four of us adults were watching and very often we were laughing out loud when I believe we were supposed to be frightened or horrified. The blah ending was the biggest disappointment of all.</p></body></html>

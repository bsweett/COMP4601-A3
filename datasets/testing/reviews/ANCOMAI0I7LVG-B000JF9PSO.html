Not even five years had passed since the tragic events of 9/11 took place before Greengrass started filming his tribute to the brave souls aboard United 93.  The horrific events were not only still fresh in the minds of the American public but the subject was sore indeed.  Greengrass was either going to succeed in bringing the American public together in their praise and admiration of his film or he was going to send them running from the theaters in aggravation and frustration and thus risked becoming the director labeled as the one who failed to do justice to such a grave subject.<br /><br />I think we can all agree that Greengrass succeeded marvelously here.<br /><br />`United 93' is a beautifully honest rendering of the tragic day known as 9/11.  Taking an honest look into not only the lives of the `victims' aboard the plane but also the hijackers and the befuddled men and women on the ground, `United 93' is able to reach into the pit of its audiences soul and extract a real connection to the events taking place on the screen.<br /><br />The film opens with a calm and eerie depiction of the four men responsible for this tragedy preparing themselves for their `mission'.  It's the perfect way to open the film for it automatically lets us know who these men our.  What I appreciate about what Greengrass does here is that, instead of shooting for the obvious and making this film all about how `evil' and `sadistic' these hijackers were he goes for the more intellectual route by showing us how `human' they were.  They honestly thought they were doing gods will.  It doesn't excuse their horrific actions, and of course neither does this film, but Greengrass successfully creates human `villains' for us.<br /><br />As effective as the opening is, it's the ending that will really stay with you.  As much as we know how this story ends we find ourselves anticipating the passengers to `save the day' so-to-speak and so when the film abruptly ends we are left heartbroken all over again, as if we are hearing about these events for the first time.<br /><br />Another aspect of `United 93' that is so masterful is the way Greengrass is able to depict the sudden and effortless decline into confusion and frustration, especially when concerning the men and women still on the ground.  As we are led through the events unfolding before the air traffic controllers we are instantly placed in their shoes and this overwhelming feeling of panic and desperation is etched across our bodies.  We feel tense; we feel scared; we feel alone.  By capturing this feeling Greengrass is able to keep the intensity high throughout the entire film, never losing the mood of the film.<br /><br />The performances by the cast of unknowns are fantastic; utterly flawless.  By casting real life airline employees he was able to capture a true human nature to the reactions of the crew as well as the passengers.  Also, but casting no-name actors he was able to capture the raw realism of the events.  There are no recognizable faces here so there is no way we can be taken out of the film so-to-speak.  This way we are always thinking about the people being portrayed and not the actor doing the portraying.<br /><br />I think when speaking of the acting one must point out the brilliance of the four actors portraying the hijackers.  Khalid Abdalla, Lewis Alsamari, Omar Berdouni and Jamie Harding all attacked these roles with fearlessness and confidence.  It was a brave thing, taking on the roles of men who are so loathed, feared and detested in America, but the manage to make these men real and human and thus utterly blew me away.  Ben Sliney has also received a lot of attention and praise for his performance (he played himself).  I must also mention him and his masterful performance; truly grounded and natural.<br /><br />In the end though, this film belongs to Paul Greengrass.  His direction of this film is flawless (that Oscar should have been his).  His tribute is so honorable.  That word seems appropriate for this film; honorable.  It handles the events, not with sugarcoated delicacy but with emotional resonance and realistic humanity.  The film is gritty and raw and abrasive but in a way that captures the heart of the people involved.<br /><br />`United 93' is one of the most controversial films around, and truly one of the most difficult to sit through; but it is a masterpiece of modern film making and is a film that everyone should experience at least once.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Docu a must for Polanski admirers"></head><body><p>No one who cares about Roman Polanski's work should miss this DVD's taut documentary about "The Pianist" and its director.  Billed as a making-of featurette, "A Story of Survival" transcends that reliably lightweight genre on the power of Polanski's words and vivid recollections. <p>The director tells his personal story clear-eyed, almost matter-of-factly, but with heart. As he speaks, images from Nazi camera crews are intercut with nearly identical clips from "The Pianist," showing how the director used WWII film archives to ensure authenticity of the movie. The making-of includes recent footage of the real-life Wladyslaw Szpilman playing a Chopin nocturne (the pianist died in 2000). <p>Polanski says he chose the autobiography of Polish musician Szpilman because it was written right after the war, when the memories were fresh. The book's detail of the Nazi occupation was "vividly true to me, a child of the same period," Polanski says.  <p>"The Pianist" looks fine, up to major studio standards. Audio is generally OK, in DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1, with a fairly tame mix that makes little use of the rear sound stage. Center-speaker dialog is noticeably muffled at times. The DVD opens with the studio's usual ads for upcoming films, particularly obtrusive given this film's subject matter and tone.</p></body></html>

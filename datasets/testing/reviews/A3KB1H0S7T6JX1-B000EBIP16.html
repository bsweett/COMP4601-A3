Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" of Narnia prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia, brings to the screen the story of four siblings, two boys and two girls, who get sent off to the countryside in an effort to get away from the war that is raging in the major cities. There they discover a secret portal in the form of a wardrobe that grants them entry into the magical kingdom of Narnia.  What they find on the other side is yet another war, only this one involves creatures found in myth...<br /><br />The acting is about average with the exception of Tilda Swinton, who just like in the movie Constantine (starring Keanu Reeves), carries out her performance very well.<br /><br />In addition, Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan was a great addition and was rather soothing.  The special effects were also very good.<br /><br />The movie definitely focuses on a much younger crowd than the Lord of the Rings, and let's be serious here, there is no comparison; LOR is a masterpiece!  This is not.<br /><br />As for the Adam and Eve part... No comment.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's a pretty good movie for kids, while an ok movie for most adults, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.</p></body></html>

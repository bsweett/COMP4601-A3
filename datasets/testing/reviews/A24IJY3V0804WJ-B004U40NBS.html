<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining but okay"></head><body><p>In `Black Swan' Darren Aronofsky depicts the pain a ballerina has to endure to successfully rise to the top of the profession, a similar theme which he had explored earlier in the film ` The Wrestler', this includes little food consumption, lot of body aches and of course sometimes bleeding toenails. Natalie Portman is the ballet dancer who is selected by the director as she embodies the character of the white swan that is innocence but he wants her to play the role of the black swan as well, of deception and intrigue. As she channels her psyche for the black swan, Portman finds that the black swan is taking over her entire persona. Acting by all the leads and supporting cast members was exemplary, Natalie Portman is truly a great actress and Mila Kunis is a revelation. Winona Ryder is surprisingly in form. The movie gathered so many accolades but I found it enjoyable but not great. Three stars. 3/30/2011</p></body></html>

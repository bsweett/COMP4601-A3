<meta name="summary" content="Terrific Ghost Movie"></head><body><p>THE ORPHANAGE is a terrific ghost movie.<br /><br />Not only does it have plenty of moments that will make you jump in your seat, and I can assure you that I did several times, but it also contains a very intelligent, human story that makes you care about the people involved.<br /><br />The exquisitely photographed Spanish-language picture (with English subtitles) was directed by J.A. Bayona and co-produced by Guillermo Del Toro.  The filmmakers describe it as "a Peter Pan-like story from the mother's point-of-view".<br /><br />Belen Rueda, in an award-worthy performance, stars as "Laura," a wife and mother, who with her family buys the seaside house that was once the orphanage where she was raised.  They have no sooner moved into the mansion when her son starts seeing "invisible friends," and shortly after that, he disappears.  Laura's husband (Fernando Cayo) thinks the boy was kidnapped, but Laura is positive that he was taken by the ghostly children in the house.<br /><br />Geraldine Chaplin has a strong cameo role as a medium.<br /><br />Leave the lights on for this one.<br /><br />?

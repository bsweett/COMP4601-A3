So you're not missing anything at all. The art book is high quality and probably the best bonus content i've yet to see in deluxe edition offerings. The only complaint is perhaps the disc mounts? they are just cheap gooey gunk hubs that you have to squash the discs back onto, and it's just sad that the edition is marred by such a detail. It's like going all out and giving the best collection, then getting super cheap on how the most important part of the package(the discs) are mounted and taken care of. It's manageable, but could have been handled better.</p></body></html>

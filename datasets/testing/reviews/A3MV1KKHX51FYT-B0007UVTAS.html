Thunder crashes. Suddenly Johnny is attacked by a stranger! The stranger chases Barbara until she takes refuge in the house. What is happening? Where are these monsters coming from? The monsters are afraid of fire. Can they barricade the house? The dialogue tells about what is happening. A radio station tells about the mass murders by ordinary looking people. Everyone must stay home and lock their doors! They have food, a radio, a rifle and bullets. Will they be safe?<br /><br />The survivors argue about the safest place in the house. TV brings the latest word - those who died recently are coming back to life and devouring live humans! Is there a solution to this problem? Dead bodies must be burned immediately. They have a plan to escape. But things don't work according to plan. Daylight brings the police and militia to shoot the zombies. There is an ironic ending to this story.<br /><br />This was a surprise hit in March 1968. It resonated with the fear of strange forces attacking America. Do the zombies symbolize a nuclear attack? What makes these films popular with audiences?</p></body></html>

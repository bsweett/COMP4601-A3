<meta name="summary" content="The best Sci-Fi film you've never seen"></head><body><p>I don't think anyone went to see this at the theatres, which is a shame. It is one of the most intelligent, engrossing Science Fiction films to come out in recent years. The film's visual style is stunning and the acting is first rate. The story, about a man searching for his lost identity who begins to unravel a conspiracy involving everyone in the city where he lives, is very well presented. I recommend this movie to anyone, not just Sci-Fi fans.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful depiction of youthful idealism in blossom"></head><body><p>'Che' Guevara, probably one of the most iconic political figures in modern Latin American history, was born on 14 June 1928 in Rosario, Argentina, into a relatively upper-middle class family. His father was a construction engineer. He was the first of five children. At the age of two he develops a severe asthmatic condition prompting his family to move to the drier climate of Alta Gracia, Cordoba. In 1948 he Enrolls in the University of Buenos Aires to study medicine, and becomes interested in leprosy. His asthma disqualifies him for military service. He qualifies as a doctor in 1953, specializing in dermatology.<br /><br />In 1951, he takes off on a motorcycle journey with his good friend, Alberto Granado. They travel from Buenos Aires, down the coast of Argentina, through the Andes into Chile, and then north into Peru, Columbia and Venezuela. The diary Che kept during this time has been published as: The Motorcycle Diaries: A Journey Around South America and the film recounts this trip. The movie is a boy's own story, an unapologetic road movie that, at times, tends to be overly didactic, but in the end, is somewhat involving.<br /><br />The film opens with Ernesto (played with veracity by the boyishly handsome Gael Garcia Bernal) living with his family in Buenos Aries. He's is an idealistic medical student, and an optimistic romantic who is more devoted to Garcia Lorca, Pablo Neruda and Incan culture than to reading Karl Marx. He has a good friendship with the effusive and demonstrative Alberto (Rodrigo de la Serna) who has just graduated university as a biochemist. Together, these young, privileged, budding rebels with a cause embark on their seven-month journey aboard a 1939 Norton 500. Their aim is to reach a Peruvian leprosarium in time for Granado's 30th birthday<br /><br />They meet many obstacles and have many adventures along the way: They dine with a wealthy family, the home of Guevara's aristocratic girlfriend Chichina (M&iacute;a Maestro). They lose their tent in high winds and are forced to rely on the goodwill of farmers for shelter and food.  In one small town, Ernesto and Alberto seek repairs for their motorcycle, and Ernesto's magnetism attracts the attention of the mechanic's wife, forcing them to leave town suddenly. Forced to hitch hike when the bike gives out, they traipse though deserts and the snow-covered Andes where they encounter a married Indian couple on the road in search of work and food. As they travel further into the middle of the continent they witness the exploitation of native workers.<br /><br />Geography and the spirit of the land are of paramount importance in The Motorcycle Diaries, and the two young men travel just because they can. The breathtaking scenery is the real star of the film, especially of Machu Picchu with streams of fog falling and rising amidst the ruins. The snow-covered Andes, a Chilean desert, and a Peruvian river that Ernesto swims across in the film's climax are physical destinations to be reached and crossed as well as stages in Ernesto's spiritual and psychological growth.<br /><br />Granado is portrayed as a loud and obnoxious freeloader but with a heart of gold, and he's incredibly loyal to his friend. Ernesto is the good, heroic doctor who administers comfort to the dying with a soft, and gentle whisper. But the film tends to be like a series of pretty postcards with poor people, and it offers little in political insight into what really made Che Guevara into a formidable Marxist rebel.

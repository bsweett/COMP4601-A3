Things, however, are not what they seem in the Garden of Eden...<br /><br />Terry O'Quinn, Josh Holloway, Dominic Monaghan, Evangeline Lilly, Naveen Andrews and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, tears, not to mention scares.  Lost does a great job of describing people's personalities, secrets and the problems they face.  It's all about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />The setting, the plot (and subplots), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Lost is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cool Movie That Gives A More Human Element To The Predators"></head><body><p>Before this film even existed I was never familiar that there was a whole universe of Alien vs Predator type stuff like comics, games etc so I was quite shocked that they made this movie and felt it would simply be another vs movie much like Freddy vs Jason. In a way it became what I expected it to be but with a little more on top, it was disappointing yet enjoyable at the same time. The major tag line for the movie was "Whoever wins, We lose" which when you watch this film you come to learn that actually that's not strictly true. The story is about a team of Archeologists who discover that there may be an ancient Aztec temple 2,000 feet under the Antarctic ice and they want to go on an expedition to explore this temple, however they find themselves in the middle of an even greater problem, a war between Alien species.<br /><br />This wasn't a reflection of what you would expect from a typical Alien or Predator movie as there is very little blood and guts and little genuine horror. We are given, however, a more human look at the Predators as we come to learn that them being on our planet is simply a hunt and they don't injure or maim those who are un-armed. To those familiar with the comics or graphic novels of the AVP series this may be a regular thing to see but to those who are just familiar with both sets of movies, this is a surprising dimension to be given to the Predators.<br /><br />Paul W.S. Anderson received a lot of criticism for this movie and to some it may be rightly so but to me I feel it's unfounded as I saw this to be a very good and entertaining movie that most everyone should own.</p></body></html>

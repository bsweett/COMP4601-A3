<meta name="summary" content="An excellent remake"></head><body><p>A remake of a Swedish horror film, a boy is being picked on by bullies at school and he encounters a young girl who just moved in next door. She is not really a girl, but a vampire who has befriended the boy. The girl needs blood to stay alive, creating a need for the man she travels with to take the lives of local residents. This is a very effective horror film that does not deluge the viewer with violence, but engrosses the moviegoer in the developing relationship at the film's core, and the fate of the schoolyard bullies of whom the boy is fearful.Very similar to the original, which is also good.</p></body></html>

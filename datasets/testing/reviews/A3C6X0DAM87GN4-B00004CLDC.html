<meta name="summary" content="At Least We Know Pesci's No Clown!"></head><body><p>Claimed by many as one of the greatest films of all time! The grestest movie of the 90's! And, one of Martin Scorses's best films to date! I have to say, I'm inclined to agree with ALL three statements. Martin Scorsese is one of the few filmmakers who has a true &quot;ear&quot; for dialogue. His movies have characters that are &quot;real&quot;. You know that the way the characters are portrayed in the film, is probably the way the &quot;real life&quot; characters act and speak. But this is something that has always been said about Scorsese. His talent for making characters that seem &quot;real&quot;. The screenplay written by Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese himslef, is truly Oscar worthy. The acting by Robert De Niro (&quot;Jimmy&quot; Conway), Ray Liotta (Henry Hill), Joe Pesci (We should all know by now, he won an Oscar for this role playing Tommy DeVito) Lorraine Bracco (Karen Hill), and Paul Sorvino (&quot;Paulie&quot; Cicero) is amazing to watch! Every detail about this film is perfect. This is a movie all movie fans have to watch. There really isn't to much more I can say that hasn't already been said by other reviewers. Just buy this movie, sit back and enjoy a film you'll never forget.</p></body></html>

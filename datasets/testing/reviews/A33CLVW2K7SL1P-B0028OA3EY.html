The movie itself was anything but a delight, as it didn't pass my "must make sense" meter.<br /><br />I like to watch films that would be classified as fantasy (and this would) with people who don't intrinsically understand fantasy. What I mean is that if a little green man pops up behind a tree and does something magical, the person I'm watching the film with should understand what the little green man's purpose is at some point prior to the conclusion of the film. If they don't, then I think the movie or story failed to establish itself appropriately. One friend of mine, who is a scientist, reads the books that win Pulitzers, yet loved the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films. To me, his assessment of whether the filmmakers did what they needed to do to make fantasy reality is a good one. That said, I've disagreed with him more than once, and the word idiot has surfaced. When it did, that never went well with us. &lt;grin><br /><br />That said, I believe that fantasy needs to make sense. But, you say, it's fantasy! It doesn't need to make sense!<br /><br />Not so.<br /><br />More than any other genre, fantasy has to make sense, because it has more to prove. You question this? Think on Gollum.<br /><br />Here we have Lex Luthor, taking a crystal from the Fortress of Solitude and encasing it a hand-made cylinder of Kryptonite (what a guess!), and launching it into the ocean, using it to try to create a continent that somehow - magically perhaps? - creates a habitable continent that will not only destroy all of the United States with the exception of the western states (YIKES...is Bryan Singer really a friend of Ann Coulter?) but will have its own mapped states - for indeed, the continent as Lex showed it looked a bit like Australia, chopped up into "regions".<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />As to the miscasts, Lois Lane looked more like a porcelain doll, and her son - and I feel horrible for saying this - just couldn't be a product of his parents, regardless of what angle they're playing. Lex Luthor was a brainless wimp who resorted to stupid bully tactics when faced with a "kryptonited" Superman. For someone smart enough to encase a crystal in kryptonite, he certainly showed himself for a fool. His thugs - well, some of his thugs didn't even have muscles. One appeared in a movie that served as a White Castle commercial.<br /><br />My guess is that since Gene Hackman played Lex Luthor in the 70s, they wanted another good actor to play Lex Luthor. The problem with that line of thinking is that when they tried to pick a good actor in the 21st century, they settled on an average actor: Kevin Spacey.<br /><br />One who wasn't miscast, but also wasn't given much material: Parker Posey. She's always a delight in whatever she does. I just saw her in "For Your Consideration", and she took what she was given and did a terrific job with it. Here, she did the same. Again - she wasn't given much.<br /><br />Even though I felt this was a disaster of a film, I'd like to see another. Certainly not from the same production team or screenwriters, but there is something in Superman's "mythology" to mine: "The Death of Superman". In the early 1990s, Superman faced a foe capable of astonishing destruction, and that series of comics sold more for DC than any other. The sequence needs to be brought to the screen, and I believe Brandon Routh is the right Superman to play the part. With CGI where it is (again, think Gollum or anything from The Lord of the Rings that wasn't human), the timing is right.<br /><br />Let's see it.<br /><br />And let's have the studios give Brandon Routh another chance with better material. He did a terrific job with what he was given.</p></body></html>

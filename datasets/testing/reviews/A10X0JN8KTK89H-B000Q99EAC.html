<meta name="summary" content="Graceful conclusions to characters are rare. - 3.5 stars"></head><body><p>With the first Rocky film, we are introduced to a decidedly American character.  A true blue collar hero who inspires the quiet majority is certainly a great accomplishment.  Sylvester Stallone merely looks outside at the real world and reflects in his film the squalor and the near-squalor surrounding and pressuring his main character.  We watch as he struggles to be the right man for a woman.  He struggles with his dreams and feelings of inadequacy, and through it all, we connect with him emotionally and we subsequently celebrate his victories.<br /><br />The second film is essentially a director's extension to the first film, and it continues and concludes much more storyline than Stallone probably intended.  Stallone is so complete with the first Rocky movies that the third, fourth, and fifth movies have nowhere believable to begin, and it's painful to watch Stallone brutalize a character that he worked so hard to build.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is interesting to me because it shows how poor and unnecessary the third, fourth, and fifth Rocky films really are.  There's no need for Rocky to overcome the overly racial-ized Clubber Lang in Rocky III, or the Cold War Russian in Rocky IV.  By far the worst of the series, Rocky V nearly obliterates everything human about Rocky Balboa, turning him into a selfish jerk; he's always self-centered, but only in Rocky V does he make that unsympathetic turn into selfishness.<br /><br />But with this final chapter, Stallone has attempted to own the mistakes of his Rocky series as well as finally write a conclusion worthy of the character he created 30 years ago.  Yes, the older Rocky lectures to us in clich&eacute;s and he tells us "something [we] already know," but he does it in a manner that is believable and insightful within the context of the character.  Stallone has rendered a good sense of desperation and pain for his older Rocky.  It's likely Stallone himself is going through these very same feelings as he ages and looks back at some mistakes and missteps in his career as well as the moments of greatness.<br /><br />My uncle is 50 years old and in fantastic shape.  After seeing the film with his kids, he thought the film didn't have enough action and that it was more about thinking and feeling than the Rocky he knows.  His description of the film is accurate, but I'm not sure what else one can expect from Stallone.  Stallone is 60 years old and in great, great shape for his age.  He gives as good a physical display as possible in this final film, and he does not appear broken or apologetic because of his age.  There are few movies out there that actually respect the aging and the elderly.  Stallone has found a way.<br /><br />It's also great to see Rocky continue to learn and not settle on old prejudices.  This struggle may be even more difficult than the physical challenges of the film.  Stallone displays a matured tenderness in a Platonic relationship with a younger woman that I wasn't expecting, and I appreciated the gesture.  Stallone seems to have touched on nearly everything in the Rocky world, tying up loose ends, finishing things.  Rocky Balboa could easily have been the conclusion to a trilogy instead of a disclaimer about what Stallone meant to say.<br /><br />In the end, the film works for me.  Despite being sentimental, I actually believed Stallone's older Rocky, mostly because it's clear that Stallone believes what he's saying and doing in this film.  Better late than never.</p></body></html>

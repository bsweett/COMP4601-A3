<meta name="summary" content="I Heart Jones!"></head><body><p>This film features one of the greatest scenes of all time starring one of the greatest actors of all times...Jones the cat!<p>Jonesy is adorable, yet so devious! I'm sure Sigourney Weaver was equally impressed with his plethora of feline talents. <p>Who can forget Jones leading Harry Dean Stanton to his death and then looking expressionless into the camera as we hear Stanton screaming in mortal pain! Sly, lil devil that Jonesy is! Or how about that fabulous scene where we see Jones emote great fear as the Alien stares at him in his futuristic cat carrier! <p>I'm no one to fantasize too much, but I like to believe Jones tipped off the Alien as to the location of Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright, thus sparing his own life in return. <p>In Aliens we saw the return of Jones, only this time with a different cat...and we could tell! This faux-Jones let loose with a half-hearted hiss, but the fans knew he was nothing but a cheap knock-off!</p></body></html>

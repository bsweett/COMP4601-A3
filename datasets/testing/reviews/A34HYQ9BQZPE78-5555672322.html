<meta name="summary" content="Happy Friday the 13th! A day where nothing happens to me when I walk under ladders!"></head><body><p>"Friday the 13th - Part 3" is one of my favorite parts of the series. Whether or not you see this in 3-D, this is a great slasher film. From the pranks and antics of Shelly to the rather goofy but entertaining hippie couple, the way cool but troublesome biker gang to Vera's death (that one was a doozy!), this movie delivers the goods. Also, this is the first "Friday the 13th" where Jason puts on the iconic hockey mask! Bloody chills and late-night thrills are flying like daggers your way on...Friday the 13th! So don't miss out on a classic slasher film, check this out as soon as you can! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

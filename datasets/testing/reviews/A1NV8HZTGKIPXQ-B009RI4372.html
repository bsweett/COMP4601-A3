A week or two ago, it was the first and third "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" films, and now this 1983 classic from Sam Raimi. I hope the second film is on the way!. This was my first real viewing of the film that I remember. I saw it in bits and pieces some years back, dug it, but didn't remember much of the film as a whole. Boy, I've been missing out!. The movie is unabashedly filled with splattering guts and grue, and any horror fan will relish in the film's over the top gore. Is this the same guy that did "Spider-Man"?. The always great Bruce Campbell heads up the small cast as Ash(Ashley), who goes along on a little outing in the woods with three other friends. Only one gets out alive. They come to a creepy old cabin, and things pretty much go downhill from there. They find odd things including a book made of human skin and a recording from a previous tenant. Before you know it, our little group has resurrected an ancient evil, and they won't be getting out alive. Soon, the demonic forces start to take over the gang, until Ash can put a bloody and gory stop to it. Raimi sets the right tone and delivers his chills and thrills in a nice, organic fashion. Looking back on these older films, one appreciates them more when comparing them to modern ones with fancy effects and CGI. Raimi doesn't skimp on the awesomeness of the idea, and let's it all rip in bloody good fun. The only thing that was skimpy in the film were the characters. With the exception of Ash, The three other friends were mainly decoration to be taken down in the most awful of ways. The setting itself was wonderful, and brilliantly shot by Raimi. Let's face it, the woods are scary. The woods at night are downright terrifying. Raimi uses wonderful skill to make the most of the wooded areas and making them not only sinister, but making them feel as if they were really alive. Some of the make-up and gore effects get chintzy here and there, but most of the time they are a gorehounds delight. What can you expect here?. Impalements, dismemberment, chainsaws, shovels, and so on. It remains to be seen if Raimi will ever return to his low budget horror film ways. It would be too bad if he didn't because he was one of the masters.</p></body></html>

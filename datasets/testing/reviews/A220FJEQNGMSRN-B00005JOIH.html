<meta name="summary" content="More psychological thriller than political thriller"></head><body><p>Months after the hype and debate, Munich stands up well to re-examination. The London sequences still look like they were shot in Hungary and the film's avoidance of the Lillehammer incident, and indeed the fact that its protagonists never truly cross the line in any of their actions tends to make it far more partisan than its makers believe. But the strengths far outweigh the flaws. Easily the best of this year's Best Picture nominees, it goes to great lengths to humanize its targets, and does so without the kind of speechifying that constantly stopped Black Sunday in its tracks. Despite the effort, it still ends up less about the moral quagmire of the Arab-Israeli conflict and more a film about the dehumanising effect on the film's righteous killers as skirted issues of moral doubt give way to the very paranoia they earlier joked about. Not that the politics aren't raised - Black September retaliation for the killings leads one of the squad to comment "We're in dialogue" while the much-criticized staircase scene does at least remain true to the characters by having THEIR dialogue limited to their own equally narrow perceptions - but the film's real ambiguity is more psychological than political or even moral. Even when the hunters become the hunted and the possibility that they're informers are also informing on them, the film avoids black and white answers: while two Israelis are definitely killed by a team hunting the assassination squad, a third is much more doubtful.<br /><br />It's a fine piece of filmmaking, too, despite the odd mis-step, never feeling its 164-minute length and throwing in some excellent moments of tension as the inexperienced killers botch their way through their hit list. The period reconstruction is generally excellent (it has the look of Frankenheimer's French Connection II had it been shot in Scope, and makes equally good use of French actors), there's the Devil in the details (beds catching fire after being machine-gunned, the ever-changing kitchens in the showroom window that Avner looks longingly at as his home life becomes a faded memory, the glimpse of the twin towers in the final scene) and the characters genuinely look like they inhabit that era - indeed, Mathieu Almaric's murky underworld figure even looks like a younger Roman Polanski circa The Tenant.<br /><br />It also showcases the perfect choice for the new James Bond - though since Eric Bana wasn't interested, Daniel Craig turned out to be an excellent alternative, here giving delivering a convincingly blokeish 70s Afrikaaner. But despite mostly strong ensemble performances, it's really Bana's show, and he responds with an impressively intelligently physical performance - first seen clenching and unclenching his fist as he watches TV coverage of the massacre, desperate to do something, posture ramrod straight when he accepts the mission but ultimately shrinking within himself as it takes its psychological toll. Spielberg's best in years, and his first film with a decent ending in more than a decade, it deserved a better reception than it found. It also deserved a better DVDrelease than the current single-disc edition that replaced the extremely limited 2-disc pressing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What a "Lifetime Channel" movie would look like if George Clooney starred in it."></head><body><p>This review is of the Standard DVD version of the film.<br /><br />While this film by Alexander Payne ("Sideways", "About Schmidt") garnered LOTS of Academy Awards nomination - and some Oscars too - I wouldn't consider it in a class with the other nominees like "Hugo" or "The Artist". This is a "family relationship" drama, pure and simple. And we have the dying, cheating wife to add some emotion to the story. (No, I'm not doing a spoiler alert here. The trailer tells you she was having an affair and she goes into a non-reversible coma in the film's first five minutes.).<br /><br />The star of the movie is George Clooney, plain and simple. And he gives a great performance - though you'll still see him as "handsome actor George Clooney playing a role". Young actress Amara Miller, as the nine-year old Scottie nearly upstages Clooney in some scenes. The film is a great promotional ad for visiting Hawaii (and a geography - and history - lesson) as Clooney and his two daughters hop the islands searching out his wife's lover.<br /><br />I certainly enjoyed the film - and so will you. Just don't expect to have a life-changing experience. And, oh yes, bring tissues. You'll need them.<br /><br />There are well over 100 reviews here already - nearly all about the theater version of the film so you can read as many as you want. This review is focusing on the Standard DVD.<br /><br />There are four bonuses on the Standard DVD: "Everybody Loves George" (7 min) where the cast talks about working with Clooney, "Working with Alexander Payne" (13 min) where everyone - including Clooney - talks about the director, "Hawaiian Style" (16 minutes) which covers modern Hawaiian culture and the films "theatrical Trailer"<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Vampirical, sexy, bloody and just good fun"></head><body><p>This is a 'genre' film, so please let's ignore those who either don't 'get' the genre, or think vampires need to be cloaked and have luciferian haircuts.<br /><br />The genre isn't known for it's complicated plots or Mills & Boon romance elements, and U:E doesn't provide either; though it does provide romance--which is always a nice counterweight to the blood and gore and hoarse, overwrought vampirical (and, in this instance, werewolfish) pronouncements and somewhat stilted dialogue. Plus there always seems to be the need for lengthy exposition and explanation. Actually there shouldn't be, but this is a sequel and there may be those who didn't see the original. I don't know how that's possible, but what the heck! The convoluted expositional material, though some attempt was made to wave it into the action, and the way in which the background really, really could have been less twisted and long-winded, is the reason why I didn't this any more points--despite Kate Beckinsale in latex (and out of it: very daring!), just about the best vampire killer since Jessica Biehl in Blade 3.<br /><br />So what, it's all about violence and sex? You bet. That's the essence of the genre and its antecedents.<br /><br />U:E delivers all of that. It wasn't 'tense' as such, because you saw the action a mile coming, but I, for one, didn't mind. I enjoyed it more than the Blade movies, possibly because of Kate Latex, but I'd like to claim it was because of the helicopter in it. And nobody would believe me. Tut, tut.<br /><br />Just sit back an enjoy it. It all ends of a positive note, though I'm kind of wondering just exactly WHAT these people eat and how much. They're not vegetarians, and hearty Russian peasant-food doesn't seem to cut it either. I wonder if the writer had a bad experience in Russia--with food that is. I got the impression there was an in-joke somewhere.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and Kate rocks and kicks serious b. To think that she played Hero and Emma in some distant past... Oh, well, this is probably better for her anyway. Exercise is good for you. Never mind 'character' roles, which are over-rated anyway.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP</p></body></html>

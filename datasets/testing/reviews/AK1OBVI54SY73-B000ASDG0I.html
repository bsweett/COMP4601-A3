<meta name="summary" content="Giving Two Highly Paid Sex Idols Guns...Not As Good As It Sounds"></head><body><p>I decided why not let's see how well Brangelina do together on film that has sparked so much controversy off- stage. I don't see it honestly. These two did not in this film feel compatiable at all. I tried to see it, but I didn't. They just did not look like a belivable couple on- screen. They seemed like two over- hyped sex idols placed together in a film so critics can call it sexy as well as full of action and get a bunch of worshippers of these sex idols to come see the movie. And it works so well too, that's why they did it for they knew Pitt and Jolie had many worshippers.<br /><br />Yet honestly this movie was not good. It wasn't the most awful movie I had ever seen, and in the ending it did get somewhat better, but not enough. The beginning of the movie was drop dead boring, and again Brangelina did not to me make a belivable couple. I kept seeing nothing but two sex idols trying to look like the ultimate couple and it doesn't work honestly for me. Then shocker they're both liars and have secretive jobs where they use guns. The movie could have made it more interesting but they didn't. Like I said the ending got better- (especially when Brad and Angelina drop their guns and start fighting that is the only really good part of the movie)- but by then I was so bored of the lame jokes they made throughout the movie and all of a sudden they showing this great love for each other that seemed so forced that the movie couldn't be saved. If you cannot believe the relationship, and that is what the whole movie is centered on, then the movie is weak. And this movie is. I had good expectations for at least Pitt to carry out the movie well, as he usually does...but I don't know Pitt failed in this movie to me...too bad maybe next film Brad.<br /><br />But yeah I wanted to write this review to warn the readers that even though the plot sounds exciting- two highly paid sex idols given guns is not as good as it sounds. Just keep that in mind.</p></body></html>

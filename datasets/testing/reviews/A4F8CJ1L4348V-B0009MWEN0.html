<meta name="summary" content="Great story and Great movie!!!"></head><body><p>I loved this movie. This was a mixture of fantasy and science fiction in a very good way. I am a fan of Casper Van Dien and he is cast very well in this role. It was a bonus that we did get to see his bare tush. I did like the special effects of this movie and the sub story that was also included in this movie. I am not going to compare it to the book and I do think it is wrong to compare a movie to the book anyway. Every artist has a different concept of what the "scenary and story" should be and how it should be presented. I thought that this was a different story to it's genre and for it's time, it did an excellent job at that. I do recommend anyone seeing this movie that is a science fiction fan or wants to see something a little different.</p></body></html>

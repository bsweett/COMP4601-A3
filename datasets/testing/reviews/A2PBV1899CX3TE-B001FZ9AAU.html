Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect choice to play bad boy/genius/arms merchant Tony Stark. He could almost be playing himself, except for the arms merchant part. It is great to see Robert Downey Jr. clean and sober after his well publicized bout with drugs. But his checkered past gives him just the edge to play the jaded Stark:<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Virginia 'Pepper' Potts: [walking in on Stark's robots trying to get him out of the Iron Man suit] What is going on here?<br />Tony Stark: Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.<br />Virginia 'Pepper' Potts: Are those bullet holes?<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />According to an interview, Downey got off the drugs after an epiphany involving a cheeseburger from Burger King. An interesting parallel developed in Iron Man where Tony Stark was captured in a foreign land, then when he escaped and got back on US soil, the first thing he craved was a cheeseburger. Product placement? Perhaps, but what could be more American? Someone said after Elvis died that it was as if there would suddenly be no more cheeseburgers. Of course, Tony Stark and Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) also love pizza from New York. One more thing, there is a really clever reference to the game 'Operation' a generational touchstone familiar to those of Stark's generation, but one that went right over the heads of the young Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow).<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. did a lot of ad libs, and his quick quips and clever comebacks added quite a lot to Iron Man:<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Christine Everheart: Mr. Stark! Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?<br />Hogan: [whispers to Stark] She's cute.<br />Tony Stark: [whispers to Hogan] She's alright?<br />[turns around]<br />Tony Stark: Hi!<br />Christine Everheart: Hi.<br />Tony Stark: Yeah. Okay, go.<br />Christine Everheart: You've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?<br />Tony Stark: Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.<br />Christine Everheart: And what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?<br />Tony Stark: That's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?<br />Christine Everheart: Brown, actually.<br />Tony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got. I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.<br />Christine Everheart: Rehearse that much?<br />Tony Stark: Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.<br />Christine Everheart: I can see that.<br />Tony Stark: I'd like to show you firsthand.<br />=================================================<br /><br />Jon Favreau did a great job of directing. Like I said, it works on many levels, much to his credit. He's come a long way since 'Swingers' but I noticed right away his obvious talent. He proved he could do a movie with a small budget, but Wow, look what he can do with a huge budget! This film reminds me a little bit of Transformers, what with the special effects and giant robotic battles, but that film also had compelling human characters to give meaning to all the sound and fury. The teenage traumas and dramas of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) made it all signify something, which was quite a feat, considering it was a movie based on toys. 'Iron Man,' thanks to clever direction by Favreau and the personality of Downey Jr. managed a similar feat. In the tsunami of Super Hero/comic book blockbusters, it really stands out. Favreau really 'got it' that as much as machines and technology fascinate us, it is still the human element that finally connects. In 'Iron Man' there are plenty of examples of machines becoming more human--and vice versa. The whole Tony Stark with a mechanical heart, and then when he puts on the Iron Man suit? Or how about the other way around, when he talks to his machines as if they were people? There is a robotic arm that follows him around, eager to do his bidding. When he chastises it for being over zealous, it droops in despair that is so human and familiar.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, that reminds me. When Tony Stark is working with his machines and computers he is listening to "Institutionalized" by Suicidal Tendencies. Pepper Potts comes in and turns it down and he yells at her as if she were his mom. There is some cool music in 'Iron Man' but you keep waiting to hear the Black Sabbath tunage of the same name. Finally, as the credits roll, we get to hear that fabulous riff. Though just an instrumental version, it sounds fresh and I wondered if it was rerecorded for the film. Whether it is a new or old version, according to the credits, it is performed by Black Sabbath. After holding back and teasing us with it, Jon Favreau finally lets us hear it, and it sounds great.<br /><br />Jon Favreau ...

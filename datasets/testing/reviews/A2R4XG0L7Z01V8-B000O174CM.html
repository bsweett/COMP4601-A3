(I do own Grease one and two, Sound Of Music etc - I am that sad.) I was actually warned before hand that the characters actually start SINGING their lines to each other, but I figured, every musical does that at some point - against a backing track. But no, there's no backing track at the some point, and it's simply stupid for them to start singing their lines.<br /><br />Basically, there's no story. It's trying to work a story around the songs, basing the story around the story of the Supremes, and also possibly Destiny's Child if you look closely enough. There's absolutely no point to Eddie Murphy's character, he has become a paraody of himself, and was pretty much playing Donkey the entire role.<br /><br />Beyonce lost approximately 20lbs to play this role, which was absolutely unnecessary since she had a gorgeous figure as it was. She thankfully, doesn't go too skinny, which could have been possible, but yet I don't think they would have told Jennifer Hudson to lose weight somehow!<br /><br />The film does start to go somewhere towards the end, for their final show, and just before Deena gets fed up with her life, and records the brilliant song "Listen". The lyrics meant a lot to me when I heard it on her album, but the lryics mean so much more in the film. It's really the only part of the movie that works.<br /><br />I would warn everybody to avoid this movie as much as possible. There's no point to it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You Can Call Him "Blondie".....Just Don't Get In His Way!"></head><body><p>There's $200,000 in gold buried in a secret place.The Man with No Name, or "Blondie" as he is so affectionaly called in this one(Eastwood), "Tuco"(Eli Wallach) and "Angel Eyes"(Lee Van Cleef)are all intent they they will be the one to walk away with it.Not even a little thing like the Civil War will keep them from their quest!<br /><br />This is the third and final film of the "Fistful of Dollars" trilogy. It reunites Eastwood, Van Cleef(as a different character in this one), Director Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone with another great "Spaghetti" Western and marvelous score to go with it.In this one there is also the addition of Eli Wallach who steals the show as  "The Ugly".<br /><br />"Blondie" and "Tuco" are already partners of sorts. They have a scheme going where the "Wanted" Tuco, who has a price on his head that is ever growing, is captured and brought in to hang. Blondie, always at the last second and with his sure shot, shoots the hangman's noose, the two escape and split the rewards.When these two part ways(and are done torturing each other)they each discover the other has a piece of the puzzle needed to find the gold!They must reunite to chase their prize.But Uh-oh... there is a third though who is also real interested in this gold. It is the very "Bad" "Angel Eyes". He discovers their secret, and will use any means neccessary to retrieve the information and secure the loot for himself.So the three form a sort of unholy alliance, make their way through scorching deserts, Civil War battles, and betrayals to get this buried treasure. Who will be the last man standing? Who will get rich? Well You Know.......<br /><br />It's a wonderfully filmed western that has everthing needed to keep you invovled. The camera shots and angles are incredible,Morricone has once again added a score that is a part of the story itself. There is lots of action, some terrific explosions,humor, and a great script.Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach will draw you in to their characters and keep you there until the final frame! It's a Western lover's Western! Oh and you will find the answer to the question I left my review of "For a Few Dollars More" with,  "Where did Clint get that wonderful pancho?"(This film is actually a prequel)<br /><br />Five stars to the film. It's fabulous. I can't go with that for the entire package though. The DVD(MGM) looks great. The picture is the best I've ever seen it. It is sharp and clear.The "Technicolor"looks good. It is presented in the original theatrical widescreen. You can see all the action in all the edges. I was a bit dissapointed with the sound though.Although, not bad in the Dolby Digital, it did not seem like an improvement on the Vhs. It seemed low and the dubbing was off quite a bit. It just doesn't seem to come up to par with other films (on DVD) of this age in that department. That's my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.(Sometimes I wish we could add a Half a star)There is some excellent extra footage in the special features sections. It is of deleted scenes that are still in Italian only. I enjoyed viewing those. There are also some production notes, you can view it in French or Spanish and there are also subtitiles if needed.<br /><br />Even with the little problem of the sound, I still love this DVD and hope someday an even better one will come along.If you're a big fan of this trilogy, Eastwood, Leone,or a good western, it's a must have in any form DVD or VHS!<br /><br />Eastwood fans, you can find this trilogy in a set along with many other Eastwood films packaged together - for action/adventure/thriller check out:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000094J9Q">The Gauntlet/True Crime</a><br /><br />Eli Wallach fans - don't forget:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059TFW">The Magnificent Seven (Special Edition)</a>(see my review for film and dvd details<br /><br />So Saddle up with Blondie..he's sooo "GOOD!" and enjoy..Laurie<br /><br />also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731959">Absolute Power</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGOG">True Crime</a></p></body></html>

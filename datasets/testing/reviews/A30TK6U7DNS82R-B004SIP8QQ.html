<meta name="summary" content="Waiting for the Ultimate Edition"></head><body><p>While waiting for the inevitable ultimate edition of this title together with Part I, in some kind of souped up "Bill Saga," this DVD transfer does just fine.  It's worth it just to see the expressions of doubt, fear, pain and triumph cross Uma Thurman's face.  The deleted scene is also worth th cost of the DVD, so there you go, it's the kind of extra I wasn't expecting with this apparent time-serving placeholder, so good for QT.  Mexican-American actors may protest QT's use of the Anglo (former) heart throb Michael Parks to play the Mexican capo, but Parks delivers a performance that outdoes his playing of a very different role in KILL BILL VOL 1.  I showed this DVD to three ftiends who had never seen part I, and none of them complained that they couldn't understand it.  It is number one, a simple story when stripped of its excrescences, and number two, hypnotic from the first majestic downbeat on the soundtrack.<br /><br />The DVD looks and sounds great all the way through to the improbable and happy ending.  Of course, we have a feeling there will be trouble ahead when the little daughter of Vivica Fox grows up to brandish a weapon raised in vengeance.  Those of you who have read Cornell Woolrich's novels THE BRIDE WORE BLACK or THE BLACK ANGEL will have experienced this richness of story-telling before, but for the rest of us, KILL BILL is a novel idea, beautifully executed by a gang of pros.</p></body></html>

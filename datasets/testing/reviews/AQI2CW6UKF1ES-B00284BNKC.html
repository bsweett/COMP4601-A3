<meta name="summary" content="A powerhouse with thrills and chills"></head><body><p>I read about it on the back of Scary Movie 2, so I read up on it, and herd it was a movie about 4 drug addicts with a scary message, so I decided to buy it.  <p>I was really hoping to see a good movie, with messagaes shoved down my throat, well the movie was outstanding, and the messages were sure tough to swallow.  <p>Ellen Burstien did a fabulas performance as Sara Goldfarb, a old woman on diet pills;  Jared Leto did a great job as well, as Sara's son Harry, who was just a plain drug addict; Jennifer Connelly did a good job of playing Harry's girlfriend, Marion, who had money, but no attention, so she's on drugs; and Marlon Waynes, at his more serious, less funny roles, does very good job of playing Tyrone, just like Harry, a plain drug addict.  <p>That's pretty much all I'm gonna say about the movie, well at the end, that's where the big messages come in.  But to those who really want a more clear enjoyable reason to say no to drugs, then this is it.  I dunno if it will work or not, but it did for me.<p>peace</p></body></html>

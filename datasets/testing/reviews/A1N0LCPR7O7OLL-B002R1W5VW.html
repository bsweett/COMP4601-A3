<meta name="summary" content="I LOVED THIS MOVIE!"></head><body><p>Highly entertaining film has one of Nic Cage's best performances to date.  Very well directed by Ridley Scott.  Sam Rockwell gives an astoundingly good comedic performance and Alison Lohman gives a terrific performance as Cage's &quot;daughter.&quot;  The cinematography is so strong I can't even tell you.  Look for Bruce Mcgill in a key supporting role.  The soundtrack is to die for...Sinatra, Sinatra, Sinatra and one of Hans Zimmer's best scores.  This is easily one of my favorite films of 2003.</p></body></html>

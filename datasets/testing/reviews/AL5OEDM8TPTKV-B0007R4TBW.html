And who knew he had within him the directing skills to pull off such a powerfully quiet performance and movie. Garden State takes off with a vision of quirkiness, and lands nearly perfectly on its two feet at the end.<br /><br />Braff, who wrote, directed, and starred in this movie, plays Andrew Largeman, a one time California actor who's forced to return to his childhood home after the untimely death of his mother. Landing in New Jersey, zombie-like Largeman is placed in the middle of his many issues, having at once to begin to deal with them. In the mix, Natalie Portman plays Samantha, a seemingly bizarre girl who's the most refreshing wind in Largeman's stale life. They meet, and a fairly predictable story ensues.<br /><br />However, the beauty of this script lies not in the story, but the quiet craziness that Braff inhabits in the movie. Nearly every scene revels in something bizarre, be it a shirt that matches wallpaper, or Samantha's hamster-loving house. Never once is this quirkiness exploited, but unfolds as naturally as Braff's performance as Largeman. You can trust Braff's unpredictability throughout the movie, because it's rich and gentle at the same time. There are too many moments in this film that are memorable, and visually stunning.<br /><br />It's only the ending of the film, which I shall not reveal, that somewhat betrays the rest of the tone of the film. Sure I was pleased with it, but it all in all felt somewhat false and forced on us. Many people I'm sure love the ending, but I wasn't convinced with it. That being said, it wasn't enough to ruin any part of the rest of this film.<br /><br />If this is the world that Braff inhabits in his imagination, the world is in store for more beauty from him in the near future. In the meantime, sit back, relax, and enjoy spending time with the oddness of New Jersey in Garden State.</p></body></html>

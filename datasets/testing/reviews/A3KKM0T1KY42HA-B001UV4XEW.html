<meta name="summary" content="Oh What a Night"></head><body><p>Maybe I had a hype-hangover leading up to my viewing of The Hangover. Because I expected one of the best comedies ever based on all of the reviews that I had read. What I got what a really good comedy...not great...but really good.<br /><br />The Hangover has plenty of laugh out loud and "oh-my-God" moments. I'm a true sucker for slapstick and The Hangover has its fair share of that too. The story is just silly--deliberately so--with 4 guys "accidentally" taking a date rape drug combined with mucho alcohol, and instead of the 4 of 'em falling flat on their faces immediately, they basically sleepwalk into some unbelievable, but hilarious escapades that none of them remember in the morning...including losing one of their buddies.<br /><br />So the next day, the "unlost boys" spend their time backtracking to find the lost boy only to discover the zany stuff that they had been into the night before with mostly hilarious results. The acting is great by a bunch of guys that I really didn't recognize prior to seeing this movie, and I'd still need to check the credits today to tell you a single one of their names. Jeffery Tambor makes an appearance as does Heather Graham, but their small parts are far overshadowed by the three guys looking for their buddy.<br /><br />There are some very memorable moments in this movie that almost had me giving it 4 stars instead of three. But then I thought about the company of 4 star movies that I'd be putting The Hangover into and it just didn't compute. So by all means, see The Hangover. It's funny! Just try not to be jaded in advance by all of the reviews that suggest the movie is some kind of classic.</p></body></html>

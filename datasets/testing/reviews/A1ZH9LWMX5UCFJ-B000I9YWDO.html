<meta name="summary" content="Awesome movie!"></head><body><p><p>This movie has to be one of the top 5 funniest movies of all time!! It is (simplistically) the story of three guys stuck in 'cubicle' jobs and the lengths they will go to get out of them. Peter, Zamir, and Michael (Bolton!) are stuck at Initech, until a hypnosis gone awry makes Peter, basically, do nothing. When the company bring in efficiency experts, he starts telling the truth about his deadend job (and TPS reports) and actually gets promoted, while his friends, who are busting their humps, get laid off. Good eventually triumphs over evil and it's all good.<br /><p>The movie is full of great characters, from the mumbling Milton (the movie is based this character, created by the same guy who made Beavis and Butthead); to the annoying boss, Lumberg; the sweet girlfriend (played by Jennifer Aniston); and, of course, the hero, Peter Gibbons (played by Ron Livingston).<br /><p>This movie is kind of an extreme version of the comic strip Dilbert, like what he would do if he actually listened to Dogbert. Buy it, you will laugh your buns off!</p></body></html>

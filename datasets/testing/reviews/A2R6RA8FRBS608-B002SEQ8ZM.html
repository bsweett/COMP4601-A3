<meta name="summary" content="a scary animated thriller--and I admit I had to watch it with the lights on !!!"></head><body><p>Coraline is a fine example of stop-motion animation at its finest; and one side of this DVD even has the feature length film in 3-D! The voiceovers are perfect and the animation is flawless; the story is quite captivating, too. I was fascinated by the plot and it never bored me. The musical score enhances the film, too.<br /><br />When the film starts, we meet young Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) and her parents who are so busy writing for a gardening catalog that they have no time for Coraline. Coraline's angst is even stronger because they just moved away from their old neighborhood into a dilapidated old building called the "Pink Palace Apartments;" Coraline has no friends here. She does meet Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey, Jr.), a quirky young boy, although they don't hit it off too well at the very start. There are the downstairs neighbors Miss April Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Miriam Forcible (Dawn French), two eccentrics who provide light comic relief from the scarier parts of the plot; and there's Mr. Sergei Alexander Bobinsky (Ian McShane), the upstairs neighbor who worked as a circus performer in his younger days. There's also the neighborhood cat who sometimes tags along after Wybie.<br /><br />Even with these new neighbors, things are pretty dull for Coraline; but things change when one day she discovers a door behind an armoire. Coraline begs her mother to open the door but they discover nothing but a wall of bricks! Coraline's mother brushes it off; but Coraline remains curious. She eventually discovers that the bricks hide a tunnel to another world just like hers--only much better. Her "other parents" are very affectionate and they anticipate Coraline's every whim; they spend time with her and she has lots of fun--there's even a circus act with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible that lets Coraline get in on the act! She's having a ball and she simply returns automatically to her real home after she goes to sleep in her "other" home.<br /><br />But the third time Coraline goes to her "other" parents and her "other" home, things start to get creepy real fast. Coraline's "other" mother and father want to sew buttons into her eyes and keep her there for good! Coraline also discovers the souls of three children whose lives have been eaten up and destroyed by the "other" mother; now Coraline finally realizes what her "other" parents want from her. Coraline's "other" parents undergo just a slight change of appearance, too.<br /><br />The plot can go anywhere from here. Coraline eventually gets back to her real home, but I won't tell you much about that so as not to ruin it for you. But what does Coraline do when she discovers that her "other" mother has taken and trapped her real parents? Can Coraline get her real parents back from this incredibly wicked "other" mother? Will the talking cat from the "other" world help Coraline or hinder her? Will Wybie help Coraline--and, if so, how? No spoilers here--watch and find out!<br /><br />The DVD has an optional running commentary with director Henry Selick and composer Bruno Coulais. In addition, one side of the DVD has a 3-D version of this film.<br /><br />Coraline impresses me as a very good thriller that has outstanding stop-motion animation. People who enjoy thrillers, animated films, and pictures that use science fiction and fantasy to further the plot would do well to add this DVD to their collections.</p></body></html>

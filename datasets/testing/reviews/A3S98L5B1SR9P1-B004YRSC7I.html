Nevertheless, it's been a hit via DVD sales. The film is set up in such a way that you are the protagonist suffering from not remembering what happened last. The sequences are brilliant. I was very sad when Chris Nolan didn't win for Best Original Screenplay for the Academy Awards. The story is original, engaging and thought provoking.</p></body></html>

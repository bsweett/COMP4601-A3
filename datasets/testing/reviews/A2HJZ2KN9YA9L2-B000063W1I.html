First they said that the only way to get the original edit of E.T. was to shell out [some hefty cash].  (I wonder how many people decided not to bother because of the prohibitive cost?)<br />The decision to have both editions available in one set at a lower price was announced only a week before the DVD was released.  <p>The packaging of the lower priced DVD is also pathetic.  It looks fine facing out in the store, with the clear plastic window on the moon-colored disc, but there is no title on the spine.  Also the cardboard trees over the cardboard window is already starting to peel away on my package.  Remove the security labels with care, as this can also damage the cardboard package.<p>This is E.T.  The highest grossing film of all time between 1982 & 1997.  A beloved film by critics & audiences alike.  Universal should have given it more respect.<p>I admit I have yet to watch the special edition.  I hesitate to tarnish the memory of the original, which still moves and engages me.</p></body></html>

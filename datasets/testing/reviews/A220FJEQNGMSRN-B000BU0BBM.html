After all, hadn't the film sat on the shelf for a year because Gilliam and the Weinsteins were arguing over the ending? Hadn't Harvey fired the cinematographer and (quite rightly in my opinion) insisted that Samantha Morton not be cast over Gilliam's wishes? And wasn't the film suddenly rushed out on the market as part of the mass dumping of other troubled Miramax/Dimension titles when the real-life Grim Brothers were making their lucrative slash-and-burn exit from Disney? How could it possibly be any good?<br /><br />The big surprise is that it actually is. While the bad reviews all seemed to focus on how this almost certainly wasn't Gilliam's vision of the film because of all the problems (as if he's known for untroubled shoots) and went to town on it, I found it surprisingly entertaining and even more surprisingly well-constructed. The screenplay is often genuinely witty and imaginative, the much-derided look of the film and its special effects are both perfectly right for the film in their sense of studio/storybook reality, Dario Marianelli's score is beautifully effective and the film itself is a lot of fun despite Heath Ledger's typical mumbling losing some of the funnier lines. Pitched somewhere between George Pal and Time Bandits, it sees a well paired Matt Damon and Ledger (mumbling aside) scamming their way from village to village vanquishing theatrically faked demons and witches until they find themselves up against the real thing in the form of Monica Belluci's immortal child-snatching queen ("She's 500 years old and the years have not been kind, I'm telling you!"). There's never much doubt about the outcome, and Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare's comic relief in the Terry Thomas-Peter Sellers roles is clumsily overplayed, but if you're willing to go along with it and take it for what it is rather than what it should be, it's a lot of fun. All in all Gilliam's most satisfying film since 12 Monkeys. I loved it.<br /><br />Gilliam's commentary avoids being too specific about the production problems while the two featurettes are typical promotional love-ins, but there's a good selection of deleted scenes, including an excellent battle with a living tree that's more exciting than anything in the picture proper.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Actually good horror movie that will make you jump"></head><body><p>This remake of Halloween by Rob Zombie actually is a good horror flick.  It made me jump in a couple of scenes.  For all that bad mouth it yes its a remake hollywood sometimes runs out of ideas. Though if you keep an open mind then you might end up liking the movie.  As for myself I enjoy the movie just seem a little long.  I thought maybe should have been maybe an hour and half not the two hours it ended up being.  But I will try seeing the sequal and then make up my mind about whole remakes Zombie is doing.  But if you love your horror movies and have an open mind to possiblity have liking this movie then watch it and see if you end up enjoying it.  Most of my horror movies I have just for the blood and gore not for the plot lines.</p></body></html>

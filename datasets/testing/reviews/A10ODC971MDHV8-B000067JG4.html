The daisy-fresh Andrews is simply terrific, whether she's acting or singing, and the songs--"Do Re Mi," "Climb Every Mountain," and "My Favorite Things"--have become part of our cultural heritage. Adapted from the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway play, the film might be a bit schmaltzy at moments, but in all, it remains utterly irresistible. The hills are still alive--and your singing pipes will be too--with the wondrous "Sound of Music."</p></body></html>

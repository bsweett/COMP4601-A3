<meta name="summary" content="Deliverance II; the really bad sequel"></head><body><p>I can't understand why people actually think this is a good movie.<br /><br />Let's start with the story first which is pretty straighforward. Group of young people get lost in the Virginia woods and get slaughtered off one by one thanks to some inbred mountain men. There's a great X-files episode about that too.<br /><br />Of course a few make it to the end. When I saw the first 15 minutes I had to think of "Deliverance" all the time and was  surprised to see that one of the persons actually referred to that movie.<br /><br />The acting is superficial and just not exciting enough. The mountain men are scary so that worked and the other make-up is not bad though not realistic. It always surprises me that in some movies the women still have the same lipstick after two days in the wilderness. Where did they get it?<br /><br />The camerawork is sometimes unbelievable. Unbelievable in the sense that you think to yourself: why?? There are some shots from underneath the passenger seat looking up at the driver, totally too much. There is also some random black and white in between, another thing I just don't get.<br /><br />Please go and see "Deliverance" or read a good book, this is 75 minutes of your life that could have been spend more wisely.</p></body></html>

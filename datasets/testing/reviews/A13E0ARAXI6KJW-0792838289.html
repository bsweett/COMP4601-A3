<meta name="summary" content="A Satanic Lansbury Dominates a Prescient, Still Mesmerizing Masterwork"></head><body><p>For those who only know Angela Lansbury from her Disney connection and her twelve years as TV's Jessica Fletcher, her bold, brilliant turn as the Machiavellian Mrs. Iselin, a role alarmingly slated for Lucille Ball, will startle you. It's a powerhouse performance in a velvet glove, and she is but one of the fascinating characters in John Frankenheimer's prescient, off-balance 1962 masterwork. Obviously a scathing indictment of McCarthyism which has reached mythic proportions, this taut political thriller initially revolves around a platoon brainwashed by Soviet and Chinese officials after their capture in Korea. The plot then settles on two of the soldiers - one is Raymond Shaw, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, whose mother craves power for her Joe McCarthy-like senator husband; the other is Captain Bennett Marco who is haunted by jarring nightmares about the interrogations and a nagging feeling about Shaw. Their storylines eventually merge but not before several unpredictable turns that leads to a breathtaking last half-hour.<br /><br />The writing by veteran scribe George Axelrod (based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel) is shrewd without ever tipping the story's surprising denouement. Of all people, Frank Sinatra plays Marco with often dynamic conviction, though I think he plays the role a bit more heroically and less ambiguously than he should have. Laurence Harvey, on the other hand, plays Shaw, the film's most difficult role, effectively teetering on the cusp of insanity throughout. But hands down, the movie belongs to Lansbury. Whether belittling her buffoonish husband or icily explaining her motivation for attaining power to her son, she refuses to chew scenery and lets the sharp dialogue spew right out of her pouty mouth.<br /><br />Smaller roles are filled interestingly though not entirely successfully. Janet Leigh has a smallish part as Marco's love interest, the best part of which is her seductive pick-up scene on the train. As Iselin, James Gregory captures the bluster and innate naivet&eacute; of a character about to be devoured by his far sharper wife. The stunning Leslie Parrish, an actress who never fulfilled her initial promise, plays Shaw's beloved Josey with a Monroe-like combination of innocence and sensuality. I just wish there was more complexity to Leigh's and Parrish's characters. There are a couple of casting errors - comic character actor John McGiver overdoing it as Iselin's liberal nemesis, Senator Jordan, and Henry Silva, made up as a Korean, as Shaw's manservant Chunjin, who has a wild kung fu fight with Sinatra.<br /><br />Frankenheimer paces the film beautifully and Lionel Lindon's cinematography tightens the close-ups of the characters as the action escalates. The 2004 Special Edition DVD has several extras though none all that outstanding. Frankenheimer's commentary is unfortunately sparse but interesting when he does speak. There is an eight-minute three-way conversation between Sinatra, Frankenheimer and Axelrod filmed in 1988 - too short but interesting, especially for the insight provided on why the film was pulled from circulation after JFK's assassination a year after it was released.  Two rather perfunctory featurettes are included - one focused on Lansbury with the actress participating, and the other on Frankenheimer but only with commentary from director William Friedkin. Regardless, the film is a must-see for anyone.</p></body></html>

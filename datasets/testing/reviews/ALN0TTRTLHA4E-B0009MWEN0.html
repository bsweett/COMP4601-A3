It was part an action adventure with parallels to the  Guadacanal Campaign and also a political tract. The political ideas in the book were something which upset leftist commentators. Effectively they involved absolute unquestioning obedience by military personnel and a notion that government should only be run by people who had served in the armed forces. Ironically these values of course brought Japan to the brink of oblivion. <p>The film is rather unusual in a number of ways. The book was largely concerned with portraying a future society so that most of the narrative involved was the main characters training and his conflict with his parents. The war itself was very high tech and the enemy a race of insects also shared the sort of technology used by humans. <p>The film is sort of satirical in a strange way. It approaches the values of the future society in a sceptical way. The heroes wear Nazi uniforms and the experiments carried out on the aliens are inhuman. News reports are used to convey information and they resemble those of a totalitarian government. Critics have cottoned on and some of them have suggested that the film raises the question about who are the baddies as if it was some massive insight. <p>The other strange thing is that the alien enemy is shown to have no technology at all. Their troops do not have weapons and they move about the starts by flinging eggs to distant planets. All this makes no sense at all. One of the scenes in the film recounts how a large city on the earth was destroyed by the aliens pushing a meteor into a collision path with earth. However if there was no technology how would they know where earth was let alone push large boulders in that direction. The reality is probably that it would have been difficult to animate the aliens so that they could carry weapons so that the plot of the book was altered accordingly.<p>Despite the plot holes, the improbabilities and the question marks about whether you are barracking for the new Reich, the film is in its own way entertaining.</p></body></html>

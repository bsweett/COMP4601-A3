As he builds his empire, an honest and persistant cop (Russell Crowe)sets out to catch him.  As Lucas's money and power increase, Crowe closes in on his operation.  This is a compelling and well-done movie which shows the hypocrisy of a gangster, living an orderly family life, while other people's children die from the drugs that he distributes.  Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe play the fascinating cat-and-mouse game of two men who are both very good at what they do, and they provide a very good evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

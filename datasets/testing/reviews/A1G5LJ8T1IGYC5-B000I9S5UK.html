<meta name="summary" content="A NOBLE ATTEMPT AT REMAKING THE 1976 JOHN CARPENTER CLASSIC"></head><body><p>ON THE NIGHT OF NEW YEAR'S EVE, A PRECINCT THAT'S ON THE VERGE OF BEING CLOSED DOWN IS SUDDENLY UNDER ATTACK BY AN ARMY OF CORRUPT COPS [IN THE ORIGINAL, IT WAS A GANG]. BEING THAT THE COPS INSIDE ARE TOTALLY OUTNUMBERED, THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GET HELP FROM THE PRISONERS THEY'RE ASSIGNED TO LOCK UP FOR THE NIGHT. THOUGH NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL VERSION, THIS REMAKE IS QUITE A GOOD FUN ACTION FLICK. ETHAN HAWKE AND LAURENCE FISHBURNE ULTIMATELY STEAL THE SHOW IN THIS MOVIE. IF YOU WANT A FAST, FURIOUS SHOOT EM UP, GO RENT THIS MOVIE.</p></body></html>

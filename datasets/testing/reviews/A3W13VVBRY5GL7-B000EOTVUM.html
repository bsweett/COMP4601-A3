<meta name="summary" content="Highly entertaining, very effective horror"></head><body><p>Kristy, Ben and Liz are three fast friends (he's Australian, they're British tourists) who decide that yes, of course it's a good idea to drive a beat-up old station wagon halfway across the Australian desert to see Wolf Creek crater, one of the most impressive meteoric craters in the world. Along with their inevitable auto breakdown comes rescue in the shape of friendly-yet-strange Mick Taylor, a bushwhacker with plenty of auto parts and a slightly aggressive desire to assist them in their hour of need.<br /><br />The most noticable thing about the first segment of 'Wolf Creek' is the slowness of the pace - this movie does take quite a while (some forty minutes) before the real subject matter is dealt with, but thanks to the quality of the acting and the really excellent, fresh direction, this long build-up doesn't drag.<br /><br />As Kirsty and Liz, Kestie Morassi and Cassandra MaGrath turn in likeable and convincing performances as two backpackers in search of fun, and don't really suffer from the 'civilian-turned-superwoman' syndrome of so many contemporary horror movies. Nathan Phillips as Ben gives a similarly decent turn in his role, and, while his part is considerably smaller, it's no less pivotal to the movie. John Jarratt as Mick Taylor is excellent; he's a malevolent and realistic version of Freddy Krugger, and the superb contrast between placidity and violence that Jarratt portrays make this one of the tightest, most effective movie villains for many years.<br /><br />Direction is gorgeous - using a very dark, washed-out palette, Greg McLean builds on his previous directorial success with award-winning short 'ICQ' by creating a visual atmosphere that's both incredibly strong and very, very subtle. The intense melancholia of the daytime scenes is nicely balanced with the artfully-shot violence and the whole piece comes off as very polished and very, very convincing.<br /><br />The fact that this is a movie based on a true story does help its rating, though - were this simply a standalone horror movie, it would be a solid three-star effort. This isn't the fault of the actors or the director, who all do superb jobs. Rather, in terms of content, not a whole lot happens here that's particularly memorable. Once the movie is over you still find yourself waiting for the real punch and muscle behind the picture; sadly, this never arrives. The ending is great, and totally unexpected for a film in this genre, but there is an overall sense of something missing from it.<br /><br />Still, while you're in the middle of it, 'Wolf Creek' is certainly a gripping and worthwhile film.<br /><br />Recommended highly for rental.</p></body></html>

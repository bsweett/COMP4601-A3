<meta name="summary" content="TROY Teems With High Adventure!"></head><body><p>I don't really care for historically accurate storylines. I watch a movie for its own merits. Good casting. Great action sequences. Solid storytelling. Beautiful locales.<br /><br />And TROY delivers all of this and more.<br /><br />From beginning to end, TROY takes you on a rollor-coaster ride full of huge battle sequences, (some of the very best ever seen on the silver screen, in fact!), and Brad Pitt actually looks convincing here. The Hulk's Eric Bana is utterly fantastic in here. When he and Brad Pitt battle it out, it is classic, vintage fighting the likes of Kill Bill's Quentin Tarintino would salivate for.<br /><br />This is by far director Wolfgang Peterson's finest film to date. One of the very best in this genre. The DVD is great, and looks awesome on my 65-inch Hi-Def TV.</p></body></html>

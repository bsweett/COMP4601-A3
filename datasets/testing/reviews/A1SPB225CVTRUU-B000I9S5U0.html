<meta name="summary" content="The Feel Good Boxing Movie of the Year!"></head><body><p>Cinderella Man is definitely more of a feel good boxing film compared to last year's Million Dollar Baby, despite there are numerous heavy-duty tearjearking moments. Well, the first half  of the film was quite depressing, and I was instantly reminded of Angela's Ashes and In America. Ultimately, this is a good biopic and it's trying to show a man who must endure hardship and physical pain so that he can raise his kids and wife. This film is not strictly about boxing, but it's more about family value and the importance of keeping ones promises and never surrendor to the challenges of life or the opponents in the boxing ring in this case. The film concentrated on intense and gripping boxing scenes in the second half, and it's a violent and brutal experience for Russell Crowe and viewers who aren't fans of boxing to begin with.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is brilliant as Jim Braddock, a New Jersey heavy weight professional boxer, who at the top of his career during the Great Depression era was forced to retire because his injury and poor performance at his last match. Without a career, he had to take a job at the mill in order to feed his three kids and wife Mae(Renee Zellweger). When he couldn't keep up with the bills, his wife had to send the kids to her relatives homes, because the electricity was out, and it was winter time. Jim had no choice but to get welfare, and when he was still short, he had to go to his former associates to ask for change. This was quite a tearjerking moment, and Crowe was mesmerizing. At this point, Zellweger also gets to have a breakdown as a result of desperation.<br /><br />Later on, Jim's manager Joe(Paul Giamatti) managed to get him one more fight. He won the match, and eventually regain his contract. Despite the worry and discouragement from Mae to return to the ring, he was determined to improve their lives by being a boxer.<br /><br />Jim's coworker buddy Mike is played by Paddy Considine who happens to be the star of In America, and he's great at doing an American accent considered he's from the UK. Other supporting roles featured Craig Bierko as Max Baer(Jim's ultimate opponent who had beaten two men to death in the ring), and  Davinci's Quest's Nicholas Campbell played Sporty Lewis.<br /><br />I think Paul Giamatti really stole quite a few scenes, and his performance could put him in the best supporting actor's cateogory. Renee Zellweger had limited screentime, and her role is underwritten that she didn't have to show off much range like Crowe's character. Russell Crowe excels throughout the tender moments as well as the brutal fight scenes. I wonder why this film is released at this time of the year, when it's nowhere near Oscar season, considered that it's got numerous nomination potentials.</p></body></html>

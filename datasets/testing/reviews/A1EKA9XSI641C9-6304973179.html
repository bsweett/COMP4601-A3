Everyone of the main 8 characters does a good job of acting (even Sonny Landham who I recently learned was a porn star).  The special effects will still stand up today against modern action pictures.  The movie quality is pretty good, but I don't really have any good sound systems to test it with.  The documentary on disc 2 is a little sub-par of what I would expect.  I'd rather see something more in depth like on the quadrilogy discs, those are documentaries.  The deleted scene + outtakes are pretty interesting along with the test footage and other featurettes.  What I find most puzzeling is that there isn't a single trailer for this movie, just a quadrilogy trailer.  Everyone should see this movie, and if you like it, than this DVD is great for you.  If you don't like the movie I have pitty on you.</p></body></html>

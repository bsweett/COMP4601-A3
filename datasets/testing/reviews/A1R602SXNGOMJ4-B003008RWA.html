<meta name="summary" content="Happy to be Canadian!"></head><body><p>I've seen all of Michael Moore's movies and I've read all of his books but none have touched me in the way that Sicko has.  First off, I want to say that I am so thankful that I'm Canadian.  I could not imagine getting sick in the US and not being able to pay for my healthcare or fight with an insurance company in what seems like a lose-lose battle.<br />I work in the Emergency Department of a hospital, actually I work in the ER at one of the hospitals featured in the movie.  This movie actually brought me to tears when I saw how people were treated and forced to make decisions they shouldn't have to make.<br />It was disturbing to see a 79 year old man who is forced to work just so he can pay for medication for both himself and his wife.  Or the man who accidentally cut off two of his fingers and had to make a decision which finger to save because he couldn't afford both.  People shouldn't have to make those kinds of decisions.  Care "doesn't depend on your premiums, it depends on your needs," the film reports. You don't have to check your health security at the door, or mortgage your future when at your most sick and vulnerable.  I can only hope this movie wakes some people up, especially those flag waving people who keep on repeating slogans like "greatest country in the world" etc.  You can demand for universal health care, and you can vote for it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another Kubrick Classic."></head><body><p>Was the book better than the movie?  WHO CARES!  This movie's got JACK!  Seriously, one of the most psychotic performances in screen history.  Nicholson WILL scare you, and if he doesn't Kubrick will, with his  collection of whacked out special effects and sound effects.  Shelley  Duvall was perfectly cast as the dullard wife in this movie and the kid,  &quot;Danny&quot; gives a chilling performance.  This may not be the same  as adaptation as King's, but one thing is for sure, the Shining will scare  the pants off of you.</p></body></html>

I usually really like Sandra Bullock  In fact I bought the film because she was in it.  But it was big disappointment.  The sound was poor, so I put on the subtitles.  Though I don't mind fantasy films, this one was a real loser.  No ups and downs, just milk-toast plain all the way through.  The plot was thin and pretty silly, the characters didn't make sense, and neither did the romance.  But that foxy dog.  Him, I liked!</p></body></html>

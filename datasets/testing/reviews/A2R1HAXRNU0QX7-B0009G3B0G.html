It almost looks like a horror movie or some sort of "serial killer" kinda thing.<br /><br />What THE JACKET really is is a mystery/thriller/romance, with Adrien Brody trying to solve the mystery...of his own death.  And he's solving the mystery by being in the future 15 years AFTER his death.  Sounds kinda cool, doesn't it.  It's a low-budget time travel movie...with one man trying to unravel his fate, and make a connection with another human being.<br /><br />Adrien Brody is the lead.  He's a vet of the first Iraq War and his back home after surviving a serious head-wound...one where he was actually "dead" for awhile.  He's a bit of a drifter, but a nice guy.  He accepts a ride from the wrong guy, and next thing he knows, he's on trial for murder and is put in an insane asylum, because he can't remember anything about what  happened.  (It's a big of a stretch that he is committed...but you've got to accept it.)  There, a doctor, played by Kris Kristofferson, conducts experiments on his patients by strapping them into a grimy straightjacket and sliding them for hours on end into a drawer in a morgue.  There Brody appears to go into a state that allows him to leap forward in time.<br /><br />I won't say too much more.  It's the kind of film that has a lot of layers to peel back before we get to the "truth."  And of course, it hedges its bets on what the truth is a little anyway, so if you're the type of person who just  HAS to know "what happened" in a neat, tidy package when you leave the theater, stay away.  It doesn't give you totally clear answers...but they were clear enough, I think, to spark conversation.<br /><br />Brody embarks on a tentative relationship with Keira Knightley, and their scenes, though perhaps a bit hard to swallow in the early going, have a certain sweetness to them.  Both of these people have some serious emotional scarring to deal with, and they both draw strength from being able to help each other.  It's not a smoldering relationship, but if feels fairly convincing.  I thought both of them were pretty good in the film.<br /><br />Kristofferson was cast, I imagine, simply because his face is so lined and care-worn...he is seediness incarnate.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, long absent (at least from films I've seen), has a bland and thankless role as another doctor, and although I'm sure she was directed to be a bit colorless, she should have done more with it.  Kelly Lynch is in a small role as Knightley's mother, and tries gamely to make an underwritten part work for her.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is intriguing.  It is nicely photographed...most of it takes place in winter and the movie just FEELS cold.  Brody and Knightly do just fine in their roles.  But I would say that all the other characters are sketchily written at best and the actors in those roles are only average at best.<br /><br />This movie won't win any awards or make any top 10 lists.  In fact, I've seen a lot of critics treat it somewhat  harshly.  But I believe if you're an intelligent filmgoer who likes a bit of suspense, a twisty plot and good atmosphere...you should like it fine.  I would give the film 3.5 stars, if we had that option.  NOT FOR KIDS.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Compelling and thoughtful story"></head><body><p>This is a compelling story that makes you think about the implications of trying to splice genetic material for the sake of creating new life forms.  Because they are so unpredictable, anything can, and does, go wrong. Such is the case with Dren, a creature that has a stinger tail, legs like a kangaroo, a face like a human's, and even wings.<br />Poor Dren is unstable and cannot control her conflicting emotions and sexual attraction to Adrien Brody's character, as well as her changeable feelings towards Sarah Polley's character.<br /><br />As one might imagine, all sorts of problems ensue. I won't spoil the movie by revealing them, but it is recommended viewing.</p></body></html>

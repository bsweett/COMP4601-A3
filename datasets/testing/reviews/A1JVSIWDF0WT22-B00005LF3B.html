<meta name="summary" content="A MIXED BAG"></head><body><p>This is a film for which I have very mixed feelings. I didn't care much for it when it first came out but through DVD have surely learned to appreciate it.<br /><br />The plane crash is truly amazing and terrifying, the island scenes great and the escape from the island / rescue will simply leave you drained. My biggest problem has to do with the long scenes between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt at the return of the movie, they're just frustrating as closure for the characters couldn't ever exist. To top this we get a touching but long an unncesary monologue well over 2 hours into the movie.<br /><br />Still, a great an unique experience which somehow I find myself repeating on a regular basis.</p></body></html>

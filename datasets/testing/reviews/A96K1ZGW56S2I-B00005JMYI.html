<meta name="summary" content="Boy Meets Girl and One Viscious Gang Fight."></head><body><p>Will Ferrell is one of the few actors from Saturday Night Live that actually has some talent and will have a very long movie career if he so desires (most of the other SNL actors who could have long movie careers are dead, though).  ANCHORMAN was a movie that Ferrell helped write and his comic touch is all over the screen play.  Ferrell can get laughs, but he also knows when to restrain himself and not play things so over the top. In fact, in some ways Ferrell is one of the most British American comic actors around.<br /><br />The subtitle of ANCHORMAN is "The Legend of Ron Burgundy" because the main character in the story is Burgundy (Ferrell).  Burgundy is the lead anchor for channel 4 news in San Diego during the mid 1970s.  The people of the city love him and he is adored everywhere he goes. But Burgundy lives a very lonely life, spending most of his nights alone at home talking to his dog Baxter.  Burgundy's closest friends are his co-workers from the station: reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), and sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner).  The four friends make a formidable group and are the top rated news team in San Diego.<br /><br />Burgundy's life changes the day that Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) appears at a Channel 4 party. Burgundy immediately falls for the mysterious woman but she leaves him cold. The next day Burgundy and company learn that the studio heads have hired Corningstone as a bow to the changing times as their newest reporter.  What follows is one bizarre boy meets girl story and a slight warning about romantic relationships in the workplace.<br /><br />When I first saw the previews for ANCHORMAN, I thought it was going to be a dumb movie like DODGEBALL. However, as noted earlier, Ferrell knows when to draw the line and though there are a few sexual jokes [...],the movie isn't that raunchy. Ferrell, well, Will Ferrell is Will Ferrell and he's a great comedian. Applegate turns in a great performance as the lovestruck/career-ladder climbing Corningstone. Steve Carell steals just about every scene he is as the mentally-challenged Tamland, as does the Burgundy's dog Baxter.<br /><br />ANCHORMAN has a fun time mixing up movie genres and throwing in pop culture references. In one of the best scenes of the movie, a major gang fight breaks out between the news teams at the 3 major networks, the public broadcast station, and the Hispanic station. During the fight, movie references as varied as PLANET OF THE APES and SPARTACUS are thrown in.  Later in the movie, Baxter, in a Lassie-like moment, saves some people from being ripped to shreds by a ferocious bear. Nevertheless, even with such humorous scenes such as these, ANCHORMAN remains like a typical boy meets girl story.  Keep it classy, San Diego.</p></body></html>

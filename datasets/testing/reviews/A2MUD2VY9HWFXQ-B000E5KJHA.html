The special effects are decent, but Depp is the real problem here. His Willy Wonka is NOT an improvement on Gene Wilder's, and he doesnt really bring anything that special to the character or the film.<br /><br />If anything, he looks to young to play the part and comes off as rather creepy. And Burton's Oompa Loompas are a joke.<br /><br />Kids may enjoy it, but as a "remake" that improves on the original, this film fails.<br /><br />Overall, the movie looks beautiful but the original 1973 version is much better and more "magical". I did however thoroughly enjoy the "squirrel scene". That was the best part of the movie in this reviewers opinion.<br /><br />Average movie that's worth a one time viewing (whereas the original can be watched repeatedly and still manages to entertain)<br /><br />Recommened for kids only. Adults should stick to the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lake Effect with a Time Warp"></head><body><p>As many people from cities by The Great Lakes know, the lake effect can change with variable winds and bring snow squalls and rains unexpectedly.  The winds of change are presented in a relationship that straddles a time barrier, a time warp that is bridged by a magic mailbox where messages are transported back and forth between two residents of a specially designed "lake house".  One resident is a Chicago architect, Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), whose father was the architect of the stunning, but idiosyncratic glass "lake house" on "stilts".  He lives there in 2004.  Kate Forster, a resident doctor, lives at the residence in 2006.  She moves out, but leaves a message in the mailbox for the new owner to forward her mail to her new address.  He intercepts the note two years earlier and leaves her a note that her new address is under construction, and her reference to animal tracks left on the residence aren't apparent.  Both are curious by the discrepancies of the other's notes.  His letters have the heading 2004; her letters have the heading 2006.  Then a mysterious but lively exchange of letters takes place.  They address these concerns, and the movie makes us take some leaps to bridge the incredulity gap.  (Wouldn't most people dismiss the other as wacko with some sort of anomoly?)  Fortunately, even though there is enough effort by the audience to suspend disbelief, there is no magic Post Office actually delivering the mail.  Somehow they believe one another and fall in love.<br /><br />There are some connections made besides the mailbox over the two year communication gap:  One is the same resident dog who is present for both owners; the other is a copy of Kate's favorite book, Jane Austin's 'Persuasion'.  The former never forgets an owner, so his straying provides a meeting between the two during a time she wouldn't know the context of the letters in 2004.  It is her birthday, and her trusting, live-in boyfriend invites the stranger neatly enough when his dog runs to the new residence they share.  The event turns into a date that becomes awkward upon her boyfriend's discovery.  An emotional connection is made, even though Kate thinks of him as a newcomer in her life.  The book provides a tangible presence and a fine allusion to another story about an old-fashioned courtship where the protagonists wait for a romance tested over time.<br /><br />Alex has two barriers to straddle.  He struggles with a hard-to-please architect mentor father who in Alex's own words, "...knew how to make a house, but not a home."  The emotional baggage is telling between himself and his father, especially when his dad's health heads south.  (And all of this is presented well with the friendly sibling rivalry with his brother, Henry.)  But the biggest barrier is trying to schedule a date with the future Kate.  He goes to Chicago's best restaurant to make a date two years in advance with her and shares his plan in a letter.  He does his best to keep the engagement, yet she is stood up, and from there she abandons hope of them ever connecting.  That is until she discovers the reason for his failure, and this leads to a chance... a chance that one can alter events and change the future.<br /><br />'The Lake House' is a pleasing and manipulative romantic movie.  It plays upon all of our buttons.  Relying on narrated letters, the movie draws upon films like 'Sleepless in Seattle' and its follow-up, 'You've Got Mail'.  Romance mainly emanates from the longing presented, and the narration of the correspondence crossing the two-year distance for both would-be lovers.  As languid as some of the scenes linger on, the resolution is strong enough to recommend this stylish and heartwarming flick about love that is meant to bridge the gap of space and time.  Just like "the lake effect," 'The Lake House' sneaks up on one and provides powerful changes that neatly blow away the debris and provide a clearer day.</p></body></html>

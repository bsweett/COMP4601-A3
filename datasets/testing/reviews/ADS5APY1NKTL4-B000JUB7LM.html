This earned well earned Oscars (among others, Best Actress for the wonderful Hilary Swank and Best Picture), and is definitely a film that director Clint Eastwood has a lot to be proud of.<br /><br />Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a dirt poor, Missouri-born waitress who lives such an impoverished life that her meals consist of leftovers from customer's plates after closing time.  She is drawn to boxing because she has spent her life just fighting to subsist in day-to-day life and really has nothing much to live for at all.  Maggie encounters Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), an excellent boxing trainer, during one of his matches.  The grizzled, seventy-four year old trainer just retorts, "I don't train girls" in response to Maggie's enthusiasm.  Frankie is a man who has been estranged from his own daughter for some years, writes her letters that are all returned, and attends daily mass.  Why, we aren't sure.  Whatever it is he is repenting for, it has eaten a hole in his heart.  Nevertheless, Maggie persists, turns up at the gym, and steadfastly proceeds to tirelessly beat the punching bag until he can't ignore her anymore.  She also makes an impression on Frankie's best friend, Eddie "Scrap Iron" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), his steadfast friend who lost an eye in a boxing match some years ago.<br /><br />This film truly transcends gender, subject matter and generations to emerge as a great friend about the triumph of the human spirit, and also the fragility of life.  Hilary Swank will permeate your soul, make you smile, and then proceed to break your heart in, this, one of her most sizzling screen performances yet.  Clint Eastwood's transformation as the wounded Frankie is touching to watch, and Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always (and received a much-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar).</p></body></html>

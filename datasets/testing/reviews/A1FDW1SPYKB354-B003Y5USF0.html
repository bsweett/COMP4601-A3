This DVD version tops the horrid Full-Frame VHS copy by a mile.<br /><br />Sure, this film is a bit overdone in many places, I suppose. And there are enough contrivances to fill up a football stadium -- but it's still a lot of fun to watch nonetheless.<br /><br />Many people have praised the tornado special effects in &#34;Twister&#34;. But, in my opinion, I found most of the CGI tornado footage in the film to look a tad bit on the &#34;phony&#34; side. I think some of these tornadoes look a little &#34;too perfect&#34; to be &#34;real&#34; looking.  The majority of twisters I've seen in pictures and on video haven't really looked like these so-called &#34;real&#34; storms we see in this motion picture. The movie's twisters, while impressive and imposing, just don't look quite &#34;right&#34; if you ask me.<br /><br />In addition, I found some of the sound effects during the tornado scenes to be a bit odd. The filmmakers have seemingly added some unusual-sounding noises to these windstorms. Since when do twisters emanate &#34;groaning&#34; noises? I've always heard that an approaching tornado sounds just like a freight train. I don't think there's any &#34;freight train&#34; sounds in this whole movie. The movie's storms seem to like to groan and whine; almost as if the filmmakers were attempting to make the tornadoes seem like &#34;living creatures&#34;. Most curious, IMO. But, oh well... :)<br /><br />The flying cows and flying tractors are probably a bit on the exaggerated side as well, but it's all in good fun -- and nobody gets hurt by the orbiting moo cows, etc., thanks to Bill Paxton's expert skills of driving directly through the center of an F4 or F5 monster tornado -- a handy skill to have in this film.<br /><br />Plus: the &#34;flying cow&#34; scene is redeemed by Bill's funny line of dialogue after being warned by Jo (Helen Hunt) of a SECOND flying moo cow in the vicinity -- &#34;Actually, I think that was the same one.&#34; (LOL!)<br /><br />Besides the massive amounts of really windy weather that we experience in the movie, another of the main reasons this motion picture appeals to me (and remains highly re-watchable) is the sheer likeability of the film's characters. The main stars of the film (Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton) perform their tasks fairly well, but it's the secondary (supporting) characters that I really found the most engaging in &#34;Twister&#34; -- such as Jami Gertz, who plays the new woman in Paxton's life. In addition to Gertz, I really like each of the characters that make up the tornado &#34;chase team&#34;, including Alan Ruck (&#34;Rabbit&#34;) and Philip Seymour Hoffman (&#34;Dusty&#34;).<br /><br />The actors that were employed to represent the team of storm-chasers here seem to me to be 'just right'. That guy &#34;Dusty&#34;, in fact, looks perfect for his part. He's totally believable, IMO, as the kind of sloppy-looking, off-the-wall guy who does nothing but chase funnel clouds across the landscape. He gets in a few good zingers of dialogue during the film, too.<br /><br />This Warner Brothers' single-disc DVD of &#34;Twister&#34; delivers the goods very nicely. The disc contains a good-looking Anamorphic 2.35:1 Widescreen print and three different 5.1 Surround soundtracks (a DTS track, along with English 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DD).<br /><br />This movie is well-suited, I think, for the really-wide &#34;scope&#34; aspect ratio we get here (2.35:1). A nice-quality video transfer makes the movie shine on this DVD.<br /><br />The DVD has some bonuses worth checking out as well. ..... There's a 2-person Audio Commentary Track, which includes participation by the film's Director (Jan de Bont). In addition to that, the disc has 2 behind-the-scenes featurettes -- &#34;The Making Of 'Twister' &#34; (run time of 13:50) and &#34;Anatomy Of A Twister&#34; (8:32). &#34;Anatomy&#34; takes us on a nice little tour showing how the special effects for the film were accomplished. For some reason, the DVD package only shows the &#34;Anatomy&#34; documentary feature, and omits the other (longer) featurette. But there *are* two separate mini-docs on the disc.<br /><br />A Van Halen music video, 2 Theatrical Trailers, and some text-only &#34;Cast & Crew&#34; Notes are also included as Special Features on the DVD.<br /><br />Some additional information about this DVD can be found below:<br /><br />&#62;&#62; Subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.<br /><br />&#62;&#62; &#34;Twister&#34; was Rated PG-13 by the MPAA for &#34;Intense depiction of very bad weather&#34; (ROFL!! That MPAA blurb kills me! Just imagine what rating a film about a Category 5 hurricane would garner! That'd probably get an NC-17! LOL!)<br /><br />&#62;&#62; Feature Film Run Time -- 1 hour, 53 minutes.<br /><br />&#62;&#62; Scene Index, located on inside flap of the &#34;Snapper&#34; case. There are a bunch of individual &#34;Chapters&#34; here too (34 total).<br /><br />-------------------------<br /><br />&#34;Twister&#34; isn't &#34;Oscar-winning&#34; good -- but it's certainly good enough to occupy a spot on the &#34;Films About Natural Phenomena&#34; DVD shelf.  :-)</p></body></html>

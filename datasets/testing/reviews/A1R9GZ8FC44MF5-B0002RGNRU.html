Its has no theme, no deep meaning, it doesnt say its better to have loved and lose then never loved at all, it says what if? you loved and losed what if? you had your memories erased to make yourself feel better How would you feel after that?, but it never answers those questioned.  The performances are ok, the story is creative and original, but all thats wasted on pointless unaffectionate love crap that means didly.  If you like chick flicks and want to see something original not, i love you, but you love him, and he loves her and blah blah blah, then this is for you.  I just think they should have tapped the people more, and not an emotion that they are striving for, i cant feel for love, i can feel for people who love and loose it, but an emotion exists to someone and in a movie their emotions dont just spill into the viewer so we have to relate to the characters.  3 out of a 10 for an original view, but its wasted on meaninglessness.</p></body></html>

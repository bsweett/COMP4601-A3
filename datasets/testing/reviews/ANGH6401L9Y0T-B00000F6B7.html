<meta name="summary" content="Ricardo Montalban is Muy Macho"></head><body><p>I like this one better than the first one, although I'm not sure my reasons are fair ones. When the first movie was made, they did not know how the public was going to react. By the time they got to this one, they'd already had millions of fans screaming "More! More!" and they knew it would sell. So they could afford to spend a bigger budget, including for script writers.<br /><br />Ricardo Montalban is Muy Macho as Khan, a criminal who had been been born in the 20th century, was frozen for long enough to emerge in the 23rd century with his band of genetically altered hippies (OK, maybe they are not quite like hippies, but that's what I kept seeing). Fifteen years ago, by Federation time, Kirk had pronounced sentence on him and marooned him (with adequate supplies) and his crew on an apparently barren planet. [Anyone remember the episode? Can you write the title and a brief synopsis in the comments?]<br /><br />Meanwhile, Spock is in command of the Enterprise, and out on a training mission with a bunch of inexperienced recruits, including an attractive female Vulcan who, for some reason, is consistently referred to as Mister. But when word comes that Space Station Regula One, which is commanded by an old girlfriend of Admiral Kirk's, is in trouble and they need to respond, Kirk takes over as commander of the ship and Spock goes back to being science officer.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Chekhov has been assigned to another ship, apparently second in command to an elegant black captain whose name I unfortunately cannot recall. Their ship is captured by Khan, who takes them over as puppets with the aid of the larval form of "the only natural life form" on the planet. A nasty thing, it enters through the ear and renders the victim a puppet to be controlled by Khan. So they are running the other ship for Khan, and of course Kirk trusts Chekhov and so believes what he says in communication.<br /><br />That's the set-up; just in case you haven't seen it, I won't give anything much away. Suffice it to say that you should keep your eye on the chief scientist's son.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Worth It - Based on a Philip K. Dick Story"></head><body><p>Can you say Philip K. Dick.  They based this movie on a story by Philp K. Dick.  This was a great movie.  I'm not a huge Nicholas Cage fan but, he was good in this movie.  There were a few cheesy parts but, overall, it was a lot of fun to watch.  The special effects were good and you start getting hooked in right away.</p></body></html>

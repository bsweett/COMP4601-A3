Like Shakespeare in Love?  WHAT?  Well, we have a writer as the hero.  And...?  And he's in love.  And...?  Okay the rest is different except that he's really working hard to be a success and he's around performers and...  Anyway &quot;it's all happening.&quot;  By the way, that should be &quot;It's all happening at the zoo&quot; a lyric from the Simon and Garfunkel album in the opening scene.<p>Okay, okay.  I'm having a little trouble with this one.  I thought it was just so, so cute, and so touching and warm, even though I know it's only &quot;[my] rock and roll fantasy.&quot;  However I don't care.  I watched practically the whole thing with tears in my eyes, partially from nostalgia from the music and the clothes and the hair styles done so perfectly, and partly because the story of &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; sweet flower child groupie, &quot;seamstress for the band&quot; (to borrow a lyric) who has a &quot;rock and roll record&quot; to borrow another lyric (Great White, this time) who wears her sophistication on her sleeve to cover her heart that's also there.  And for a slightly nerdish kid who grows up before our eyes and falls in love and is too young to really be loved in return, a nervous writer on his first assignment who overwrites and sees the best in people, even as they treat him like a little girl, a kid who is so, so unsure of himself.  (Is writer and director Cameron Crowe again reprising his youth as he did so well in the script for the now classic coming of ager, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)?)<p>Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's daughter) is unforgettable in a completely original creation dreamed up (or better yet, probably remembered) by Crowe, who here improves on his fine directorial work in Jerry Maguire (1996).  I understand that Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter 1997) was originally picked to play the part of Penny Lane, and she is a fine talent, but quite frankly Kate Hudson stole all the scenes she was in (she learned it from her mother!) and I don't think the movie would have been quite the beguiling, bittersweet experience it was without her.<p>Billy Crudup (a name to look at twice) manages to look exactly like all the wanna-be rock stars of the seventies wished they had while exuding the kind of charm that breaks hearts as Russell Hammond, guitarist for the band and Penny's true love.  Patrick Fugit is William Miller the would be teenaged writer as hero who is charming, boyish, vulnerable and well, heroic.  Frances McDormand plays his mother with just the right combination of pigheaded earnestness and her unique sense of the comedic.  <p>The entire cast was terrific and the characters were truly original.  The Academy Award winning script was clever and at times profound, interspersed with sparkling lines.  (My favorite, from Lester Bangs on William's school mates: &quot;You'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle.&quot;)  Also, and this is important, Crowe paid close attention to detail throughout and never lost his concentration.  Everything seemed amazingly authentic right down to the floral stitch on Russell's shirts and the bottles of Jack Daniels in his hands.  And nothing was done in a routine manner.  Every scene was carefully planned and even minor characters were roundly developed.  I'm thinking in particular of Lester Bangs, mentor and cynical rock critic brought to life in a fine performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and William's sweet and slightly dippy sister, vividly portrayed by Zooey Deschanel.  Notice how Crowe even took the trouble to satirize flight attendants with the parody of the stewardess uniforms (day glow orange!).<p>Yes, I loved this film, and I predict that the Academy, whose members obviously did not really SEE this film, will be rewarding the producers sometime down the road for the oversight.</p></body></html>

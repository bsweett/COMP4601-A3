<meta name="summary" content="First Stop: Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?"></head><body><p>First let me just say that if you've never seen any of the Indiana Jones movies (what are the chances?...slim to none?) that you should see them before you dive into Crystal Skull. Why? Because if Crystal Skull is your first Indy experience, you'll wonder what all the hype was about. Crystal Skull is a fairly good adventure, but it's mediocre at best when compared to its Indy predecessors.<br /><br />In Crystal Skull Indy's on a mission to return a stolen relic to its rightful resting place (familiar, no?). But unlike the first three Indy movies, Steven Spielberg has gone wayyy over the top with the "yeah right" moments and the CGI special effects...to the point of distraction! It seemed like almost all of the action was noticeably filmed in front of a green screen....Which wouldn't have been too bad if wasn't so darn noticeable.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...Crystal Skull was a fun story and I was thoroughly entertained watching. I just found myself rolling my eyes a bit too much in disbelief. So I'd recommend starting with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ONE">the first three movies</a> before you jump onto the Blu Ray train to the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />It certainly isn't necessary to see the first three movies in the series in order to fully enjoy Crystal Skull. But it will give you some history prior to jumping into a 4th in a series, and it won't be time wasted as they are all excellent films. Here's a little bit on each:<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark was stunning for its time (1981). No surprise with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg at the helm. Raiders holds up as one of the best action movies to date. Indiana Jones searches for and tries to protect a powerful relic from getting into the wrong hands. Viewers get thoroughly entertained with a fast moving, suspenseful and thrilling ride.<br /><br />In Temple of Doom (1984) Indy inadvertently finds himself thrust into village overrun by an evil cult that commit human sacrifice and child slavery. Ironically, while the themes in Temple are much darker than its processor, Spielberg actually 'dumbed it down' a bit (with a good amount of slapstick and other silliness) in order to keep the film attractive to wider audiences and also to attain the first ever PG-13 rating (instead of an R).<br /><br />The Last Crusade (1989) brings in the great Sean Connery as Indy's dad, and together they fulfill a lifelong dream (more the Dad's dream than Indy's) of finding The Holy Grail. Strangely, Last Crusade got hit with a PG-13, but it was much lighter than Temple of Doom, and it went back to a more Lost Ark kind of action film.<br /><br />So my recommendation is get familiar with (or brush up on) the Indiana Jones movies that made Indiana Jones a household name before you venture to the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Detroit Maverick Strikes Again"></head><body><p>This has to be the strangest film ever made. A horror film that is not the least bit scary, it somehow remains one of my favorites of all time. Fuse "the Three Stooges" with "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and you have "Evil Dead 2," the cult classic from Sam "the Detroit Maverick" Raimi, which is nothing more than a blur of campy dialogue, blood-splatterings and whiplash steadicam shots that will have your head spinning. Don't be fooled by the title: this is not a sequel to the low-low budget "Evil Dead." It is a higher-budget remake, with all pretense of horror abandoned in favor of outrageous campiness and the most ridiculoulsy funny violence ever filmed (a demon keeps threatening to "swallow your soul"....the hero chops its head off with an axe....the demon keeps threatening him....hero produces double-barreled shotgun, quips "Swallow this" and blows the talking head to bits). Essentially, "2" is about some witless kids who take up in a cabin deep in the remote forest, and unwittingly (get it?) unleash blood-thirsty, hyperkinetic demons when they read from a cursed spellbook. Sound familiar? Of course it does. You know, for instance, the demons are going to feast on the kids at will, whittling them away with cat-and-mouse games, until just one or two are left....however, it is at this point that Evil Dead departs from every other horror flick you've ever seen. Hero Ash (Bruce Campbell, B-movie God and durable victim of physical stunts aplenty) isn't content to just sit by and be terrified. Oh, no. Instead of playing the scream-and-run role so familiar in slasher movies, Ash goes loco on the demons arses, and with axe, shotgun and chainsaw proceeds to do to them what they so rashly tried to do to him. And boy, does he ever whoop some tail. Picture if one of the victims in the "Friday the 13th" series had flipped his lid, and instead of cowering under the bed, gotten up inflicted a New York Housing Authority ...whipping on Jason halfway through the movie, beating him like a red-headed stepchild and then plunging a sharp instrument through his guts. Now picture that for 85 minutes. That's "Evil Dead 2." A classic.</p></body></html>

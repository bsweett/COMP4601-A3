<meta name="summary" content="The Good Shepherd - Metaphoric History of the CIA"></head><body><p>With a very slow moving story, we are brought through the beginnings of what some may view of how the CIA developed in the first few decades.  Matt Damon does an excellent job portraying a very quiet, somewhat cold hearted man who gets recruited by the CIA while studying at Yale.<br /><br />We have a number of flashbacks and forwards that you must keep an eye on to make sure you know where you are.  Interestingly developed as a story, you see one man's life influenced by what he does for the company.  Although a very interesting story, there are messages you see in the movie.  One is a scene where someone is wearing one of the infamous hoods from the Abu Gharib tortures, this is supposed to be 1959 or 1960, so, the message here is that this type of thing has been common since then.<br /><br />Interesting things include the development of the character played by Damon through the beginnings with WWII and the relationship with the spy networks in England.<br /><br />The play of Damon and his colleagues, the intrigue, the distrust and the final culmination of his work.  The Good Shepherd plays as a metaphor of sorts, reflecting how one man's life applies to the beginnings and development of the agency.</p></body></html>

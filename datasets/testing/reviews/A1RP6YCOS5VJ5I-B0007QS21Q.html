<meta name="summary" content="A Great Scifi Film"></head><body><p>This is movie was as good as I hoped it would be. Since it was written by the man who wrote The Minority Report, my favorite book, I expected great things from this movie and that's exactly what I got. The story never dulled, from start to finish, this film was excellent and action packed. Will Smith does a great job in lead.<br /><br />The robots really are the stars of the film; they are done very well and very entertaining to watch. Every minute the robots are shown, it just makes the film all that more entertaining.<br /><br />If you love good Scifi movies, you have found it here.</p></body></html>

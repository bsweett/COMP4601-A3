<meta name="summary" content="I'm in the Mood for Fun"></head><body><p>After all the gritty, raw-edged tragedies I have seen this past few months, I did not expect to like George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg's latest installment to the iconic Indiana Jones series, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".<br /><br />But I did.<br /><br />Yes, the characters are older, but aren't we all?  Heck, my son wasn't even born when the first Indiana Jones adventure came out in 1981.  Harrison Ford's Indie sports a little grizzle around the muzzle, but he still snaps a mean whip, gets a lot of action dropping his trademark fedora and apparently can blow a mean horn as being a man few women forget.  Age seems to agree with him, however, he's wiser, a bit mellower--the cynicism so intrinsic to the earlier character toned down--and just as much of a klutz as he is an impulsive hero.  His moments with a certain reptilian creature sparked involuntary amusement in me--after all he is Indiana Jones, a cinematic icon, as familiar to me as Superman and Batman--so why wouldn't I instantly want to hunker down in the plush-ness of my movie theatre seat, wallow in popcorn and just enjoy?<br /><br />Likewise, the rest of Indie's band of adjuncts falls in line in a beloved formula again recognizable to the audience.  Shia La Bouef as Mutt Williams emulates a likeable sidekick--his fifties panache evident in his `Route 66' habit of combing his would-be greaser ducktail at the most unlikely times.  As the film's young beefcake (as his last name implies,) Shia unfortunately has some of the film's sillier interludes--his entrance on motorbike donned in Marlon Brando's "The Wild One" regalia, his acrobatic foray with a group of coiffed Amazonian monkeys and his exhibition of fencing skills while balancing precariously on racing jeeps may suspend belief, but only for a few seconds as the audience again gets a grip and realizes that Spielberg delivers exactly what is expected--family fun targeted to capture multi-generations.<br /><br />Karen Allen, as love interest Marion Ravenwood, impressed me the least--as the independent woman depicted in `Raiders', now seasoned and tempered by time and life she should have toyed with Indie a bit--more banter--more anger--more tension--she caved a little too fast for my sensibilities--she too should have had a little more fun with him.  What I did find admirable about Ms. Allen is her authenticity--yes, she is no longer the fresh cheeked ing&eacute;nue, but, thank heavens, she has not opted for a plastic Botoxed face and the other sickeningly vain accoutrements of pseudo-sophistication that so many older actresses seem to find necessary to compete in a marketplace obsessed with youth.  Refreshingly, Ms Allen revels in her crow's feet--her beaming smile a testament to real inner beauty.<br /><br />Cate Blanchard comes as close to embodying Natasha Fatale of Rocky & Bullwinkle fame as arch-villainess Irina Spalko as it gets--she's more cartoon than actual woman, playing campy with a capital "C"---but who cares?  Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?  These characters are supposed to be larger than life, like the serials from the 30s. Blanchard sure seems to be having a good time goose-stepping it up with a sword at her jumpsuit belt.  All chiseled cheekbones and manic eyes when she sites the answer to her heart's craving for power, she certainly doesn't seem to care if the audience laughs at her or not--she anticipates it--its all part of the caricature--putting the "E" into Evil.<br /><br />Bottom line?  "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" delivers pretty much what one would expect from an Indiana Jones installment.  Fun, campy, corny, chuck full of improbable stunts, raucous chases and a wild storyline that reaches resolution in just over two hours, this film oscillates with pure fun.  The intermingling of the Sci-Fi with the archaeological lends a dash of signature Lucas to an already appealing hero that is probably better known than Homer's Odysseus.  If you, like me have had your fill of this year's serious drama and just want to sit back and enjoy the ride, this one's recommended for you.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Human Trafficking"></head><body><p>Saw this one in the movies and what a great movie!  Granted, this is sensitive subject matter, something that you have been hearing about repeatedly in movies and television specials over the last couple of years.  This movie is about human trafficking--in other words, stealing young girls, rendering them helpless with drugs, and then selling them into prostitution to the highest bidder, usually in a foreign country.<br /><br />With that said, Bryan (Neeson) and former wife Lenore are divorced.  Lenore has remarried a rich businessman.  Bryan and Lenore's daughter Kim is now 17 and lives with Lenore.  Bryan sees Kim when he wants but Lenore is kind of icy toward him, still apparently blaming him for the years he wasn't there for mother and daughter.  As a now retired CIA field operative (apparently well thought of and quite proficient in his job), Bryan wants to get to know his little girl better now.  The movie begins as he reminisces about Kim's 5th birthday and subsequently takes a present to her 17th birthday party at the mansion.<br /><br />In the very beginning, Bryan helps a few of his CIA buddies with a side job as a bodyguard to a singer at a concert and befriends her when he saves her life.  You see Bryan's well choreographed protective moves as he puts down the offender and your confidence level in Bryan's abilities soar.  The singer offers to help Kim get a start singing (if she is as good as Bryan says).  Excited to tell Kim, Bryan is mentally slapped in the face when he finds that Kim wants to meet with him over lunch only to get his signed permission to go to Europe with her girlfriend.  Reluctantly, he agrees to sign and off she goes, with conditions to check in daily on the cell phone Bryan gives her.<br /><br />No sooner does the plane land in Paris, than the girls are greeted by a 2-legged snake who is part of an Albanian trafficking ring.  Peter offers to share a taxi with them (to split the expense).  Finding out where they live, he is able to contact the thugs who show up to grab them.  Kim is talking to her father on the cell when she sees the bad guys grab her girlfriend from a window and it is a chilling moment when Bryan says "You will be taken" and to leave the cell phone on.  A few moments later, my heart sank as they grabbed Kim, screaming and thrashing and drug her from under the bed.  Bryan tells the kidnappers to turn her loose and he won't kill them.  Of course, the ego-driven, invincible bad guys tell him something similar to "good luck". Well, the Albanians just unleashed their worst nightmare! Bryan, with all his training and skills in tact, is quickly on a plane to Paris on a hell-bent mission to get Kim back, no-holds barred.<br /><br />This is a kick-butt movie, full of intense action, stunts, car-chases, and killing.  While I'm not normally big on watching people get killed, I have to admit, the bad guys and their crimes were so despicable that I did enjoy seeing them get taken out, one by one.  There is edge-of-your-seat action as Bryan hunts down the bad guys one by one and weaves his way through the network of filth to try to find his little girl.<br /><br />Although extremely unlikely that he would have ever found her, it was a great movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Considering the subject matter, it was done fairly tastefully, too.<br />From what I remember, you did not actually see the sexual acts or the girls getting drugged.  A lot of people do get shot and someone does get tortured to find out needed information.<br /><br />Quite possibly, more of our teenagers need to be sensitized to the facts that these things do happen.  Although no one should live in fear, young women do need to exercise sufficient caution about where they go and who they go with. I hope this film will both entertain and educate our young people.</p></body></html>

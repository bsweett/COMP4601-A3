<meta name="summary" content="Carrie"></head><body><p>Carrie (Speical Edition)<br /><br />The movie is considered a classic. I enjoyed it but I wouldn't call it one of my all-time favorite horror movies. I did notice a few problems with the speical edition dvd, I dont know if other people have the same problem with this dvd<br /><br />When the woman tells the gym teacher to shove it up her...and that's it. This is the first time viewing the film and do not know if it's like that in the original version or this is a screw up. I think it is because the gym teacher got really mad hahahaha.<br /><br />When the three guys are picking out tuxedo's, it quickly goes into Alvin and The Chipmunk mode for a brief few seconds. That has to be a dvd error and not apart of the original film.<br /><br />That's the two problems I had with the movie but other then that, it was enjoyable.</p></body></html>

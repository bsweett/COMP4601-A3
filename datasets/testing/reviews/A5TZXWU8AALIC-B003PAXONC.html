<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyed This (But Haven't Read the Book Yet)"></head><body><p>Although I'm a fan of Richard Matheson's work, I have yet to read his novel, I AM LEGEND.<br /><br />I also haven't seen the first movie version with Vincent Price called THE LAST MAN ON EARTH.  I saw the cult favorite THE OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston years and years ago but I think I'll read the book and then watch that one again.  And maybe this one again.<br /><br />This third version, thankfully keeping Matheson's great title, is well-made and entertaining but I thought the first half was stronger than the second half.  I liked Will Smith in I, ROBOT and he does a great job here as well, playing a dogged scientist hunting in an eerily empty New York City by day and searching for a cure to the plague virus by night.  (Years ago it had been announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger would play in this--imagine Dr. Arnold as a gov't scientist!)<br /><br />The zombie/vampires were creepy enough but they were obviously computer generated.  I wished there had been more personality given to them and more personal conflict between Smith and the monsters (a relationship between the lead monster and a female monster Smith abducts to experiment on is hinted at but never developed any further).<br /><br />Still, some great shots of NYC standing empty, overrun by weeds and deer.<br /><br />(Now I'll have to read the novel.  Without knowing the original story, I liked this movie version).</p></body></html>

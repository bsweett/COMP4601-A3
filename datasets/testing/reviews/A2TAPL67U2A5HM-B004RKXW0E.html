<meta name="summary" content="Toy Story 3 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)"></head><body><p>Toy Story 3 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) is the third movie in the Toy Story series and an amazing sequel. Andy is going to college and the toys (except Woody) are supposed to be put in the attic. But a mix up ensues and the adventure begins. The animation is superb and I love the music in the movie. At the end of the movie you can not wait till the next Toy Story movie comes out. I am very much hoping for a fourth, and a fifth movie. I loved it. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></body></html>

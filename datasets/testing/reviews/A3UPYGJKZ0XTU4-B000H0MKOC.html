<meta name="summary" content="Smart Satire of Spin Doctors & Political Correctness. But It Comes Up Too Soft."></head><body><p>For his first feature-length film, Jason Reitman has adapted Christopher Buckley's 1994 novel "Thank You for Smoking", a satire of Capitol Hill lobbyists, Senators, and, most of all, political correctness. The hero, or anti-hero, of our story is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), hustler extraordinaire and lobbyist for the tobacco industry. His job is spin control, and Nick delights in the hatred that his powers of persuasion inspires. Senator Finistirre (William H. Macy), a Birkenstock-wearing liberal from Vermont, wants to require that a skull and crossbones be displayed on cigarette packages. Nick's hard-nosed boss "BR" (J.K. Simmons) is panicked at the state of cigarette sales. It's up to Nick to save the day by promoting onscreen smoking in Hollywood and taking on Finistirre in Congress. But a certain pretty reporter (Katie Holmes) is out to dish the dirt on the tobacco lobby.<br /><br />There is some very funny stuff in "Thank You for Smoking", and Aaron Eckhart is perfect for the part of this fast-talking, energetic, unscrupulous charmer. The self-described Merchants of Death, or "MOD Squad", the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms lobbyists who meet for lunch to brag about their deceptions and compare death tolls, are hilarious. I could easily watch alcohol's Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), the gun lobby's Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), and tobacco's Nick Naylor gab for half an hour. That would be a side-splitting short film in itself. My hat is off to that trio of actors. J.K. Simmons' barking "BR" is equally comical. Where the film arguably fails is in being too sentimental. Jason Reitman has given Nick a young son, Joey (Cameron Bright), who is not in the book. Joey humanizes Nick by looking up to his father. Reitman's reasons for creating the boy are obvious, but I wonder if it was wise to soften Nick's character. A relentless Nick would have been better.<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking" skewers political correctness and spin doctors in line with the novel's intentions. It doesn't condone or discourage smoking. It pokes fun at the people who manufacture spin and the people who eat it up. I can only speculate, but I assume that Christopher Buckley chose the tobacco lobby because it is absurd and essentially innocuous. The tobacco lobby has gone to extraordinary lengths to tell people a bunch of lies that no one ever believed. This is a lifestyle lobby. It's perfect fodder for satire, as are self-righteous anti-tobacco crusaders. "Thank You for Smoking" excels in characterizations but doesn't have the guts to be uncompromising satire. Still, it's enjoyable if you're looking for politically incorrect comedy.  Ironically, no one smokes in this film.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): Bonus features include 13 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary; a Charlie Rose Show (18 min) with Jason Reitman, Christopher Buckley, Aaron Eckhart, and producer David O. Sacks; 2 featurettes; a Poster Art Gallery (7 posters); an Art Department Gallery with logos and artwork from the film; a Storyboard Gallery of 112 storyboards from quite a few scenes; a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min); and a Soundtrack Spot (30 sec). "Unfiltered Comedy: The Making of Thank You For Smoking" (9 min) features interviews with cast and Jason Reitman, who talk about characters and the film's think-for-yourself themes. "America: Living In Spin" (5 min) is examples of "spin" from the movie and real media with commentary. I recommend the Charlie Rose feature and the Making Of feature. There are 2 audio commentaries: The first is by director Jason Reitman. The second is by Reitman and actors Aaron Eckhart and David Koechner. Most of what Reitman says in the 2nd commentary repeats what he said in the 1st. So, if you're going to listen to one commentary, listen to the 2nd one. Reitman talks about changes he made to the book and provides some technical information, while the actors recall their experiences filming. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

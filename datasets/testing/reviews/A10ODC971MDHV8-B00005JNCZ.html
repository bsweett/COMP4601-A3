As the journey begins in Buenos Aires, we meet two bon vivants from prosperous families who wish to see the world before embarking on a career. Ultimately, they encounter South America's impoverished Indian communities, and spend an entire year ministering to the ailing denizens of a leper colony. Anchored by Bernal and De La Serna's hearty performances, "Diaries" is a rousing portrait of political integrity and humanitarian commitment.</p></body></html>

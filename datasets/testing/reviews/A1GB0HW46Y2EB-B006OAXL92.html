<meta name="summary" content="I Really Did Want to Like This Movie"></head><body><p>Since the  history of the art of motion pictures, along with the art of audio reproduction, have always been subjects of great interest to me, I would have expected this homage to the movies by Martin Scorsese to be at least engrossing if not emotionally involving.  Unhappily neither was the case.<br /><br />We have a story, which is a fantasy, set in the late 1920s to the middle 1930s taking place largely in a Parisian railway station in which, curiously, all of the characters not only exclusively speak English, but with a British accent.  Dramatically the film simply never takes off as one expects it to.  Even the action (chase) scenes are curiously static and uninvolving.  The acting style and delivery of the dialogue resemble to a very large degree the first Harry Potter picture -- utterly sleep inducing.<br /><br />A great effort is made to recreate the times in which the story takes place but that feeling never develops.  Visually, the film  looks very impressive and its sound recording is excellent.  Nearly every shot of Paris appears to be the result of CGI processing and everything about the ancient city looks absolutely new.  Nothing looks old or worn but appears to have been created only for this picture and intended to be discarded or erased when the film was completed.  Efforts were made to evoke the period between the Great War and World War II.  We see scenes of a group of musicians in the station with a guitarist apparently made up to resemble Django Reinhardt, but the music heard resembles romantic Parisian styles and bears no relation whatever to the jazz style for which Reinhardt was famous.  I had the distinct impression that no one in connection with the making of this film had ever heard one of Django Reinhardt's recordings.  Other recreations of historic figures pop up from time to time, as in Woody Allen's "Midnight in Paris" and it didn't work that well there either.<br /><br />When clips or recreations from the old movies of Harold Lloyd and Georges Melies are seen, they, as usual, are shown at the current sound projection speed of 24 frames per second, while having been originally shot at an average of 16 frames per second with the result that the characters are seen running around like jumping jacks and not the way they must have been seen in theaters of the times in which the films were made.  Scorsese makes an obvious appeal for the preservation of motion pictures, something with which I entirely sympathize.  But if one observes what has been achieved in film preservation in the last twenty or thirty years, I think he need have few fears.<br /><br />A few years ago I heard an interview I think on NPR, with a film screen writer or director whose name now escapes me.  He  made an interesting comparison between writing a novel and a screenplay.  He noted that when writing a novel, you can always go back and add more and more detail as the story requires, as in designing a building -- you just make it bigger if you have to.  But he said that writing a successful screenplay is like designing an airplane that must be light enough to take off and fly or it's a complete failure at what it is primarily intended to accomplish. This is the feeling I had watching "Hugo" -- that it was simply static with long pauses in the dialog that slowed the pacing to a fatal degree.  And I really did so want to like this picture.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Scary but Unitentionally funny."></head><body><p>Due to the age of the film, the zombies in this movie will get chuckles instead of screams, but somehow this movie still packs atmosphere. Most movies that have poor special effects or makeup usually to turn out to be good, but this one did. It is scary but you do have to watch it in the right state of mind. Don't watch it to make fun of it, but tell yourself ahead of time that you are going to get scared in this and ignore the poor makeup. If you can do that you'll enjoy this classic.</p></body></html>

And don't get moi wrong:  WEDDING CRASHERS has some definite hysterical moments (I thought I was going to bust a gut during the quail hunting scene).  But even in a screwball comedy like this, there has to be the development of a story, and the characters, even as outrageous as they are, have to stay consistent.  But such is not the case here, as WEDDING CRASHERS meanders, dips, curls, stalls, and cartwheels into a big pile of ho-hum.<br /><br />Which is a shame, as the story had potential and merit, with divorce mediators John and Jeremy (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) crashing weddings in the D.C. area--all to pick up girls, girls in the romantic mood for love, due to the matrimony environment.  And such a guise works, and works well, until the two buddies crash a wedding of the daughter of powerful Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken, who is absolutely wasted in this one-dimensional role).  John and Jeremy fall for the Secretary's other two daughters, and that's when this movie falls apart.  I mean, the wheels come off.<br /><br />There's nothing really left once the love interests are introduced, other than boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back.  Well, we do have the added dimension that John's love interest Claire (Rachel McAdams) has a fiance to contend with, and he's a very snobby Ivy League type.  Throw in some really bizarre scenes (e.g., any of the Cleary family dinner scenes) where the material isn't funny, but just comes off as plain weird, along with some slow and ineffective mushy scenes between Wilson and McAdams, and this movie slows to a crawl.  Definite head-scratching stuff, because it just doesn't mesh or work.<br /><br />Vaughn, as if he's trying to salvage this picture himself, is over the top and smothering in literally every scene he's in, while Wilson's character is all over the map:  irresponsible, responsible, mature, immature, reflective, ignorant, etc.  This guy really does some puzzling stuff, particularly at the end of the movie, which made me wonder if the writers decided to create an entirely different character than the one who began the picture.  And then Will Ferrell is brought in as a cameo as this two-hour marathon comes to an end, yet his appearance is bizarre, and definitely not funny.  Jane Seymour plays Walken's wacky and unfaithful wife; Jane still looks very good (and proves it in one scene), but her role is very typical of the entire movie.  WEDDING CRASHERS looks good, has a few raunchy laughs, and even had some potential. . .yet the entire picture is like my kitchen after I try to cook omelettes:  A mess.<br /><br />--D.

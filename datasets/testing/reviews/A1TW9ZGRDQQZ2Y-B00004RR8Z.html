It is much larger and has webbing in between its leg tentacles. The egg this face hugger came from was either carried by the queen and or laid by her at the end of Aliens. She doesn't need her egg sack to lay eggs, its just for extra protection for the eggs as they drop out. She could have even carried the egg containing the super-hugger on her back tentacle spikes, and left it on the drop ship(It never shows her from the back in Aliens until after she drops from hiding). Anyways, even though it is not fully explained in the movie, the script states that this super-hugger has the ability to lay a queen embryo in a host AND a warrior protector alien to defend her as she grows to her full size to lay eggs. So this super-hugger is unique and can produce 2 aliens instead of just the one. I know there are a lot of holes in this plot to cover, but this seems to be the most talked about one. Also, it takes days longer for the alien to pop out of Ripley because Alien Queens take much longer to grow before having all components to function on there own, without the warmth of a host. Hope this helps you understand the beggining. Not the best movie either, but light years ahead of Alien Ressurection.</p></body></html>

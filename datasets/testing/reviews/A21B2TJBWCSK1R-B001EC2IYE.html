<meta name="summary" content="Another understated, graceful drama from Eastwood"></head><body><p>Untalented filmmakers make the mistake of keeping their movies simple with obvious, pedestrian direction. Clint Eastwood is an experienced director who doesn't need overt, stylistic flourishes to make his point. His movies are the epitome of understatement. Fresh from the critical success of Mystic River, he is back with another minimalist yet thematically dark drama that works its way into your head in a powerful and emotionally affective way.<br /><br />While filmmakers like Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino belong to the Wal-Mart school of filmmaking with their obvious, overstated movies, Eastwood is couture-subtle, graceful filmmaking. Million Dollar Baby bucks the current trend that most Hollywood films adhere to by trying desperately to appeal to the largest demographic possible, usually a young one with disposable income. Eastwood isn't interested in demographics or test screenings.<br /><br />First and foremost, his movie is about characters and telling a story-a true rarity these days. He takes his time telling the story, letting us get to know the characters and settle into this world full of hard-working people who get by the best that they can with what they have. They aren't sophisticated people but have a quiet dignity. Million Dollar Baby explores the complex morality of death. It is not an easy matter and Eastwood doesn't let us off with easy answers. He keeps things honest and there is an authenticity to the way the characters act, feel and speak that avoids the tired cliches that fail most movies.<br /><br />The first DVD includes a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The second DVD begins with a featurette called "Born to Fight," that examines the characters in the movie. Real life boxer Lucia Rijker who trained Hilary Swank and was one her opponents in the movie talks about the art of boxing, coming off as quite eloquent and passionate about not just the sport but the movie as well.<br /><br />"The Producers' Round 15" explores the origins of the movie. Producer Albert S. Ruddy recounts how he convinced F.X. Toole to option his book and get it away from HBO who was also interested in adapting it. This is an excellent look at how this project came together.<br /><br />This brings us to "James Lipton Takes on Three," that features the host of The Actors Studio interviewing Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Swank right after they each won an Academy Award for the movie. Lipton is his usual pretentious self as he treats every question that he asks like it was the most important words ever spoken. Thankfully, the three actors cut through all of this as Freeman calls the Oscars a contest while Eastwood is his usual low-key self.<br /><br />Finally, the last disc contains Eastwood's elegant and understated score for Million Dollar Baby.</p></body></html>

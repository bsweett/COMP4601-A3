Let's just say I cannot view Rick James' "Superfreak" the same again.  For one thing, this family is dysfunctional from the word go. Big time back seat drivers, but in spite of their own quirks and such, they do rally behind the little girl so that she could enter The Little Miss Sunshine contest and enter it she does. I am a bit surprised how they came cross country in such a broke down vehicle, but then again, I seen worse, and if your determination is more than the circumstances, that wins through. But when that little girl did her song, I fell out. First of all, you got all these prim, grown looking little girls up there looking Jon Benet Ramsey clones doing cutesy stuff; but you got this little girl  dancing to "Superfreak" albeit not appropriate for a little girl, not for a beauty show of Jon Benet clones, and when the folks went off, I could see the mother's concern for her child shine through for a bit, but when they joined her, I saw a family who showed love and concern for the smallest of their family. So to me, they can't be that dysfunctional.Quirky, not your average, everyday family, but family nonetheless.</p></body></html>

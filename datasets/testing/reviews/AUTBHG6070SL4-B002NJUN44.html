The adventure story is classic: the evil tyrant, the secret cabal of rebels just waiting to strike for freedom, the young hero-to-be, unknown even to himself. Dragons are cool, especially when they're done as well as they are here. The castworks pretty well, too, with Jeremy Irons as the mysterious mentor and Sienna Guillory as the magical princess in need of rescue. Her slight resemblance to Tilda Swinton is a minor but enjoyable benefit to the role.<br /><br />The story, written by a 15 year old prodigy, has plenty of excitement - but that's about it. Characters tend toward the one-dimensional, and a few strands in the story seem not so tightly wound with the others. Set your expectations accordingly. The "Eragon" movie is big and beautiful, it's exciting and kid-safe, and that's enough.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

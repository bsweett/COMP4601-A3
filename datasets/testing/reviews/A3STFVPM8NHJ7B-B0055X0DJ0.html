I first saw the preview and it didn't look so good back then. I love movies so I went to go see it anyway and boy did it suck. The Decepticons looked awesome but the movie followed every basic summer blockbuster cliche known to man. Here are some problems I hate with the film<br /><br />The red and green car followed Sam around and the little truck robot were all stereotypes. Red and green acted like gangsta's and reminded me of Jar Jar Binks in a way. They were so friggin annoying. The truck played off as a wise guy from Brooklyn. He reminded me of Frank from Men in Black but less cuter to look at.<br /><br />Sex. A movie staring Megan Fox had sex in it and it wasn't five stars?! Well if you consider two dogs humping and that little truck robot humping Megan Fox's leg as hot, then I guess you got issues.<br /><br />John Turturro's character in this movie was a direct rip off of Randy Quaid's character in Independence Day.<br /><br />Megan Fox was a sexy, there is no arguing that. She looked alot like Angelina Jolie in this film but way would you film more then half here scenes in slow-motion? But damn, she is friggin smoking.<br /><br />The humor was the kind of quick chuckle but doesnt last long kind. Make sense? I didnt laugh at anything in here but im sure plenty of people laughed at Sam's mom high on brownies. There was anther annoying character, sorry to digress but this film had some really annoying characters in it.<br /><br />The story lacked suspense as you could tell what was going happen before it happened.<br /><br />I cant really say I enjoyed to much of the film. The bad guys looked cool, some fights were pretty neat, and Megan Fox is smoking hot.<br /><br />All in all, it's a summer film. It's an escape from work or too get the kids off your back for a few hours. It's entertainment and not the meaning of life. I may have crapped on this film but I know thousands of people will go away saying it was the greatest film this summer or of all time.</p></body></html>

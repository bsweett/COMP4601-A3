<meta name="summary" content="THE ROCK HAS ARRIVED"></head><body><p>The Rundown is the perfect mix of action and comedy and shows that the Rock has arrived as an actor. The Scorpion King was a poorly written fluke and a bad movie to judge he Rock's acting abilities on, where as the Rundown shows that he is a multi-dimensional actor and not just a macho knuckle head. The Rundown is a fun movie, and Arnold even makes an apperance to "pass the torch" of the action genre to the Rock.<br /><br /> The rock plays a retreaval expert out to track down a mobster's son and bring him back to L.A. so he can get the money to open his own resturaunt, but he runs into many obstacles along the way which provide the fun and action of this great movie. Well worth the watch and worth adding to any movie collection.</p></body></html>

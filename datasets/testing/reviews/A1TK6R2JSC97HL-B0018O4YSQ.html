<meta name="summary" content="The city is the most interesting character of all"></head><body><p>"Dark City" is a beguiling movie for its first half - it's one of those movies that looks great until it hits a point at which it has to start telling its story, one which never quite matches the almost literally absorbing location.<br /><br />"Dark City" is as much a place as a moment frozen in time.  The occupants of the gritty metropolis go about their busy lives, not realizing that it's always night.  Daytime memories are invented and inserted by the city's true masters - an army of deathly gray old men, malevolent "Strangers" with the power to bend the very structure of the city to their will, and traffic in the memories of its oblivious residents.  The Strangers have a plan - one that requires that they understand us and how we're shaped by our whacked out memories.  Every night at midnight, The Strangers put the entire city to sleep and activate a huge, thought-controlled machine which re-makes the city.  Dowdy waitresses become sultry cabaret singers; blue collar families become uppercrust society clans; the innocent become the hunted guilty.  The last of these is Rufus Sewell, implicated (within the continuity of the city's human population) a murderer.  But Sewell proves uncannily immune to the Strangers and their machines.  Sewell's character receives unlikely help from William Hurt, one of the city's detectives, Jennifer Connelly as the sultry object of Sewell's affections, and Kiefer Sutherland as a human in an uneasy league with the Strangers.  The city is the star of the movie, fluid yet consistently beguiling - it terrifies and tantalizes at the same time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the city is so compelling that none of the movie's human stars can match it - and most of the juiciest performances belong to "The Strangers" and Kiefer Sutherland's mysterious Peter-Lorre-like scientist.  Unable to fashion out a plot in which the city can retain its enigmatic character while Sewell takes on the Strangers, "Dark City" boils down to a conventional sci-fi thriller with a disappointingly sunny ending that makes you forget its cool and gritty subject.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood's Masterpiece (and that's saying something!)"></head><body><p>I finally got to see "Million Dollar Baby" last night when my son talked me into taking him to the video store.  While he picked out something for himself, I made a bee-line for a movie I'd wanted to see since its' release.  Some things improve with age and Clint Eastwood definitely fits into that category.  I don't think he's acted in or directed anything that hasn't been very good or great since he quit being Dirty Harry.  After all the hype I had heard for roughly a year, I was afraid I'd be in for a let down.  To my pleasant surprize, "Million Dollar Baby" was better than I thought it would be (and I was expecting something pretty darn good).<br /><br />There are things that make good movies great and "Million Dollar Baby" has most of them.  The acting is superb with special recognition to the top three in the cast; Eastwood, Hillary Swank, and the ever-reliable Morgan Freeman.  The story is very good as well.  I admit that I had my doubts about women's professional boxing.  However, it was very easy to buy into the script.  In fact, I don't think that the story would have worked nearly as well with a male boxer instead.  However, the greatest aspect of this movie is the directing.  There are so many short takes and side stories that weave into such a completeness.<br /><br />The story itself is rather simple and, to a point, rather predictable.  An aging boxing trainer/manager (played by Eastwood) is asked to train a female boxing wannabe (played by Hillary Swank) who's already a bit old to be entering the profession.  Obviously he turns the woman down and, just as obviously, the movie doesn't end with that refusal.  Those short takes and side stories tell us why the manager, Frankie Dunn, eventually takes her on.  Naturally, with his training, her career takes off.  I'll let up on the plot at that point.  You probably know the rest but let's not take chances.  I had heard just enough to have a general idea of what happened next.  Even so, when the first big moment came, it hit me like a brick even though I knew it was coming.  The eventual climax was also something I knew was coming.  I admit that I had an issue with that.  My wife, who is a quadraplegic, came in around this point in the movie and watched the rest of it with me.  We both realized that there were some very wrong choices being made.  I was prepared to dwell on that but I realized that I could let go of that and focus on the bigger picture.  You see, the movie isn't about her; it's about him.<br /><br />For all of the drama and excitement of boxing and the odd relationships it fosters, "Million Dollar Baby" comes down to a story about love and the sacrifice one man is willing to make for someone he cares for.  For those of us concerned about the moral issue raised by this movie it is important to consider the real dilemna of Frankie Dunn.  All of those rather odd (and somewhat humorous) scenes of his visits with his priest lets us know that this is a man who is devoted to his Catholic faith.  He may not always grasp the particulars but he has been quietly living his faith all these years and now it is truly put to the test.  In granting his friend's wish, Dunn forfeits everything he holds dear.  To put it theologically; Dunn betrays the greatest commandment in favor of the second greatest commandment.  Let's face it; most of us are at least a commandment or two below that.  In making a movie that delivers so powerful a message, Clint Eastwood has created a masterpiece!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A portrait of a true American hero. The common man who was wronged by justice, and then takes his revenge"></head><body><p>This is the kind of movie where you route for the success of the man doing all the killing.  Clyde's wife is raped, and she and his daughter are murdered by two men right in front of him in a home invasion robbery and murder.<br /><br />Nick, the prosecutor (Jamie Foxx), plea-bargains with one of the men to sell out the other in this crime.  The end result is that the man who raped and killed Clyde's wife gets a reduced sentence and is pretty much set free, while the other guy (who didn't do any killing, just robbery) is actually sent to death row.<br /><br />So, what makes you mad about this movie is how our judicial system works.  Nick, the prosecutor is more concerned about winning his case, than he is about actually seeking justice for the man whose family was murdered.<br /><br />So Clyde (Gerard Butler), a rightfully angry man of whom justice just disregarded him, calculates a well orchestrated plan to deliver his own brand of justice and actually go after all the participants of the prosecuting case that wronged him, including Clyde's wife's rapist.  Although, Clyde's main enemy in this revenge is Nick the Prosecutor.<br /><br />So, Clyde studies how law works and learns all the things that it takes for him to maintain his rights in a way that the prosecutor and judge cannot touch him.  And people are dying all around Nick the Prosecutor, where we believe that Nick's death will be last so that he can see Clyde takes his revenge on everyone else first.<br /><br />This movie was great to watch, until you get to the end where the judicial system once again wins to the disappointment of the viewing audience.  When Clyde was about to deliver that final blow to the whole courthouse and the rest of the city's judicial members that represent law and order, it is thwarted by Nick and his assistant.  Clyde dies sitting on his own bomb.  This was so disappointing.  So, the man who had to watch his own family die, is killed by the prosecutor who set his family's murderer free.<br /><br />If I were allowed to write the ending of this movie, I would have had Clyde successfully kill Nick's wife and daughter, and then let Nick the Prosecutor, live with the very kind of outcome that he creates as justice for other victims.  Unfortunately, this movie ended with just what might have been a realistic ending:<br /><br />No justice.  None from the beginning, and none at the end.<br /><br />Although, I don't endorse murder of any kind, I do believe Clyde should have had the right to kill his family's killer. If Nick the Prosecutor had to do anything it took to win his case, he should have at least allowed Clyde the liberty of killing his family's murderer himself.  If Nick the Prosecutor was a fair and decent man, he would have given Clyde all the information needed for Clyde to hunt him down and take his revenge on only him. No one else would have to get hurt. This would be deemed fair by the American majority.  This would be closer to justice.  Don't you think?<br /><br />If Clyde killed Nick's family and let Nick the Prosecutor live on without his family, that would make this a more justified and enjoyable film.  I would definitely want to own it then.<br /><br />I hated the ending here. I was just so disgusted!</p></body></html>

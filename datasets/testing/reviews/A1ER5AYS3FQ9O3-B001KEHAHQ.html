<meta name="summary" content="Steve Martin shines but don't expect Peter sellers- this is a revamped version, but still FINE viewing"></head><body><p>First off, it was a pretty brave move on Steve Martin's part to take on a role which is indelibly linked with Peter Sellers, a man who was not only formidable, nutty, and temperamental but a  genius when it came to creating pure, innovative (and often impromptu) humor.<br /><br />  Martin is certainly no slouch in this department but I confess that I was a bit leery of his abilities (talented as he is) to hold his own against one of the stronger figures in comedic history. I wondered if he'd fall short in the effort.<br /><br />  IMO, he does just fine, even adding special nuances that are absolutely brilliant, including an accent that is original, not a mere duplication of what Sellers did. He also adds flourishes of his own, reviving the Pink Panther genre.<br /><br />  BUT (and this is not a small point)....the rest of the cast pales in comparison to Martin. Beyonce Knowles (cast a a beautiful pop star..gee,what a stretch) does well enough but has a ways to go before reaching full acting potential. She seems simply typecast as a the beautiful, possibly duplicitous, character. Kevin Kline, one of my favorite actors, has a relatively small role and that was a bit of a disappointment because I'd have liked to see more of him on screen.<br /><br />  While the plots of Pink Panther movies aren't all that critical (playing a secondary role to the humor) there certainly IS a plot here, involving murder, thievery and all that). Whether you care about that plot is another matter. I didn't, preferring to focus on Martin, a guy who seems to hit his stride here. It was pure entertainment just watching him perform.<br /><br />  I think there is a unique freshness to this film and it wouldn't be such a bad thing if the film was compared to the original, each film having their own merits - and flaws.<br /><br />  Humor, of course, is always a bit hit or miss...and very personal. Some people laugh hysterically at things other people simply "don't get." Also, some people just don't seem to like Martin.<br /><br />  What I've always liked about Martin's humor is that it often forces me to think about what deeper meanings under his apparent frivolity. It doesn't seem to be ALL fun and games...although the fun and games are pretty entertaining in and of themselves.<br /><br />  Take a chance on this one. It is NOT for everyone and it WILL leave some people cold. BUt it might be just the thing for a pleasant diversion and some solid humor.</p></body></html>

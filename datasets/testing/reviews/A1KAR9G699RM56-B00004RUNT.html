<meta name="summary" content="2, because that is more its element."></head><body><p>When someone created a movie called the Fifth Element, you'd think they'd also keep in mind the need for an entertaining plot (important film element), which was partially there, and good characters (another element that was scarce and fleeting.)<br /><br />The story is about an alien race who has five elements which, when positioned properly, save the world, but the fifth element can be switched out for evil and cause the obvious ever-looming end of the world.<br /><br />Really though, after you've calmly accepted rabbi-alien coordination and Chris Tuckers outrageous character, which is similar to most of his other ones, then you've probably finished the movie.  You may ask yourself why, and that comes down to two reasons: first, Willis' character does make you care, and the other annoying characters, from alien to human, are just pretty annoying.  On the positive side I can say there were a few humorous parts, but they did not last long, and honestly are not very memorable.<br /><br />So, if you just have to see every sci-fi movie out there, then this is yours, but if you have the chance to avoid then I suggest it, because I'm saving you from important missing elements.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good movie / Bad ending  * * Spoilers**"></head><body><p>Seriously, This film COULD have been good because the characters were all interesting enough,some a little weirder than others,but then....I thought the player had messed up because it ended in the middle.Then I realize that WAS the end !<br /><br />I actually did get very caught up in the story.<br /><br />He gets a letter , unsigned ,that says he has a Son , and his detective wannabe buddy takes a list of names of ex lovers , maps him out a route , motel rooms etc. (He has to travel what I assumed is long distances between ex-lovers) and he is off on a quest to find the Son , who we find out in the beginning (from the pink letter) is also looking for Dad.<br /><br />I still can't figure out why all the guessing on his part.( Why not just straight out ASK these women if he fathered a child by them,Instead it is a big guessing game.) And<br /><br />the way we were left just HANGING ,The director must have wanted us to come to our own conclusions , ( either THAT or he was doing MAJOR drugs :)<br /><br />We are left with all the pink clues,and I would've thought it was the trailer trashy girl ( because of the pink typewriter)  but her reaction at seeing him would have been WAY off base after HER getting ahold of HIM. So in my mind that eliminated HER.<br /><br />But yet, the kid that shows up at the end I DID feel was supposed to be his Son...then another kid drives by in a car to confuse us FURTHER<br /><br />I have seen movies end abruptly , but this takes the cake.<br /><br />My guess is that the trailer trash girl who had him beat up WAS supposed to be the Mother of his child after all, and the kid who he bought the sandwich for wasn't the Son (because his reaction was genuine shock and he ran away ), and I feel that the kid that drove by in the car probably was just a "symbol" that Bill Murray would just never know for sure  but my guess is as good as anybodys.<br /><br />Any comments on anyone else's conclusions would be appreciated. I know a lot of the more modern movies now don't have the "traditional ending" and we are left to explore the possibilities on our own , but dammit! I want an ANSWER.<br /><br />Although the letdown really sucks , I still give it 3 stars for the acting.Anyone else interested in sharing thier thoughts on a conclusion here? Thanks!</p></body></html>

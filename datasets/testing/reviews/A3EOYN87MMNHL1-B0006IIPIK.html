I was kept enthralled and in a dreamlike state while viewing the tableau of retro-futuristic eye candy.  Paltrow and Jolie are stunningly beautiful, as always, and Jude Law is handsome, daring and fearless in thwarting the diabolical designs of the villian and his killing machines.  I fell victim to an addictive contagion of wanting more, more, more of these stunning escapades and special effects.  So very Flash Gordon-y.  You must see!</p></body></html>

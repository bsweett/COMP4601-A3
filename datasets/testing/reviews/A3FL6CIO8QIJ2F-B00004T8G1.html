<meta name="summary" content=""A Better Than Average Horror Film""></head><body><p>After "Halloween" became the biggest independent thriller of all-time in 1978, producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill set out to see if lightning could strike twice with "The Fog". Hitting theatres in 1979, the film wasn't as big a hit as its predecessor, but nevertheless "The Fog" has lived on as being one of the scariest films of the 1970's. "The Fog" is about a seaside town called Antonio Bay that is blanketed by a huge fogbank one cool summer night. People are murdered and all hell breaks loose as this small coastal town tries to survive the evil that lurks around them. Jamie Lee Curtis, who starred in "Halloween", also stars in this blockbuster, along with her mother, one of the screen's greatest stars Janet Leigh. Adrienne Barbeau, who became a TV star in "Maude", also stars as a disc jockey working in a lighthouse who witnesses the fog descending on the town and its inhabitants. The film is really scary, not in the sense that its filled with a lot of gore, but in the fact that not knowing what is in the fog makes things that more terrifying.<br /> This DVD contains a ton of bonuses, including a documentary on the film with its stars, outtakes, audio commentary by the producers, and much more.<br /> "Newsweek" calls the film "crisply chilling" and "The Film Journal" says, "The Fog" is "a tale of nocturnal terror".<br /> Columbia released a remake of "The Fog" in 2006, and it is a great film worth of owning.</p></body></html>

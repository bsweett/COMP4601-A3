In all probability, they have inspired more speculation and creative work than have all the others combined.  Inspired by a graphic novel series, this effort by the Hughes brothers is another in a long history of productions, each seeking to draw us into the terrors of a century past, leaving us once again chilled and bemused.<p>One of the things that set 'From Hell' apart is its efforts at authenticity.  Costumes, characters and locale are minutely recreated.  We are granted a long glance into the squalid realities of life in places like Whitechapel with very little candy coating.  The conflicts between the bleak lives of London's prostitutes and the posh upper classes underline the fact that whatever the real motivation for the crimes, they were also symptomatic of a deeply divided culture.  Characters like Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) must tread the borders of both realms seeing only the worst that either has to offer.<p>It is only fitting that Abberline is a frequent user of opium who often has 'visions' that show him glimpses of the crimes.  Fitting, because his opponent, the killer also lives in a dream world of his own.  Abberline is a spectator forced to witness the inexorable artwork of the madman, desperately trying to puzzle out the motivations that set his nightmares in motion.  We the onlookers shift out viewpoints from killer, to investigator, to victim, and beyond.  For all that we have more information than Abberline; we come no closer to a solution.<p>Depp gives Abberline a certain fragility that contrasts with both the characters of the prostitutes he is struggling to save (led by Heather Graham as Mary Kelly) and the overwhelming self-confidence of those he serves.  As such he is a bit of a phantom when compared to the likes of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm).  This works quite well given that Abberline's own story can only begin to peak as The Ripper's draws to a close.  <p>The film's explanation of the murders is one popular with many Ripper aficionados, and has been used in films before.  The Hughes do find a way to twist this in their own way at the end, providing a bit of a surprise for the most jaded.  While the production has more than its share of the grim and gory, the Hughes rarely indulge in purely gratuitous violence.  Horror, when it comes, is swift and sure.  We are not so much frightened as kept in a state of nervous anticipation.<p>The two discs of this set provide a beneficence of additional materials.  Features about everything from Ripperology to the use of Absinthe.  There is a tour of the recreated Whitechapel and full-length commentaries on the film.  The Hughes brothers really did go to extremes in their production and the extras provide much insight into compulsive filmmaking.</p></body></html>

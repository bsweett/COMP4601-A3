<meta name="summary" content="Mission accomplished"></head><body><p>Finally we have a sequel that stands closer to the series. Don't get me wrong mission impossible pt 1 was good but at times it was overly complex. Not to mention MI: 2 which was an exaggerated over blown sequel. Instead here we have a balanced chemistry of a simpler plot and more realistic action.And what I liked was that everything is accomplished as a group; exactly as it was done in the TV series. Best of all  JJ Abrahams creates tension from time to time with interesting close ups that are in a way similar to the TV show 24.<br /><br />The plot in this movie is much simpler than part 1 but not so simplistic as part 2. It all begins with Ethan Hunt coming back to the IMF agency; he is sent to rescue a fellow agent. Along the way we discover there is an arms dealer that is negotiating with terrorist about a potential nuclear device, possibly known as The Rabbits Foot. I don't want to ruin anymore but at least I can say that it's a worthy sequel. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because even though the movie is somewhat better than the predecessors i felt that it was still a Tom Cruise vehicle, concentrating on an exaggerated ego of his. But other than that is was all good. Mission accomplished<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

She finds herself irresistably drawn to Robbie Turner, the housekeeper's son whom her father supports.  Her little sister Briony has a girlish crush on Robbie and she spies on Robbie and her sister and lies about their relationship.  Her lies have far-reaching consequences and throughout her adult life she seeks to make atonement for her misdeeds.  This is a beautiful film, wonderfully acted, which truly does justice to the novel upon which it is based.</p></body></html>

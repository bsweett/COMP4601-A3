Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, a retired government employee who has moved to California to be closer to his daughter Kim, played by Lost's Maggie Grace. Bryan is hesitant when Kim says she is going on a trip to Europe with her friends, but agrees to let her go if she promises to call. Kim does call from Paris, and while she does, Kim witnesses her friend Amanda being kidnapped. Suddenly, Bryan isn't retired anymore. He goes into "government employee mode" and tells Kim that she is going to be kidnapped and that he will come and save her.<br /><br />While working for the government, Bryan was a "preventer." He prevented bad things from happening. You get a picture of what those skills were when he begans encountering and dispatching with thugs easily in France. The action is fast paced and brutal, but not overly gory since this is a PG-13 movie.<br /><br />Bryan's CIA friends tell him he only has 96 hours to save his daughter. Neeson effortly displays the passion and desperation of a father about to lose his daughter. The villians are solid, and Maggie Grace is good as Kim.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and believe it did so well at the theaters because it is about a father saving his daughter. It is about good versus evil. There is no gray area, if you are bad, you are killed by Bryan Mills, angry father and killing machine. There's no message in the film about the environment or terrorism or anything else that many big movies try to slip in to appease the critics. It's a simple movie where you know right away that all the bad guys deserve to die and you'll feel good when they do.</p></body></html>

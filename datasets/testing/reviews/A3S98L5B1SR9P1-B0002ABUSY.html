<meta name="summary" content="It was a great movie, but isn't a masterpiece"></head><body><p>I love the original "Dead" series by George Romero. I strayed away from this film for awhile, due to the fact that I'm not a fan of remakes. Anyway, while flipping through channels once, this film was on. So I decided to view this movie, not expecting much of course, however, I was curious about this film. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.<br /><br />A group of survivors barricade theirselves in a mall when an unknown plague causes the dead to rise and hunt for flesh. They are fine at first, but then they start running out of things they need to stay alive, such as food and electricity, and the zombies begin to find ways to get to them.<br /><br />The only flaw I thought the film had is: Zombies aren't supposed to run, or twitch. I know movies aren't real, but they still contain certain laws of nature, and a zombie wouldn't be dashing down the street. In the end, I still prefer Romero's masterpiece. If you want an action film, see the remake. If you want a horror film, watch the original.</p></body></html>

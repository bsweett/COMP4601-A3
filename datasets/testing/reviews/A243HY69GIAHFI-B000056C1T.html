To be sure, there are moments when something approaching genuine history shines through, despite the writer's best efforts to the contrary.  But by and large THE PATRIOT leaves us unmolested by fact.  It's almost an outrage that the writer should've chosen to create as his hero an amalgamation of several real figures, instead of just choosing one.  Apart from being more interesting than the lackluster Mr. Martin, someone like Francis Marion would have grounded the writer in fact.  <p>As it is, THE PATRIOT wallows in its own excess.  You know the drill: improbable escapes from point-blank shooting, clever repartee with bloodthirsty enemies, a man of peace called back for one last mission of revenge.  It's so hackneyed, the script could've been phoned in.<p>Unfortunately, this film looks great.  The producers try, and largely succeed, to imbue the picture with an authentic historic look.  The costumer, cinematographer and special effects guys, in particular, deserve Oscars ? for their efforts.  The problem is they've created a piece of total fabrication that some kids are no doubt going to grow up thinking is true.  And it's not.  It just LOOKS fabulously real.  <p>To be fair, THE PATRIOT gives a general sense of truth.  It did happen that the South Carolina militia was vital to the success of the Continentals in the Revolutionary War.  Cornwallis was indeed the fashion plate and gentleman of society that is portrayed here.  And there was reluctance on the part of a lot of the American aristocracy to enter the war.  <p>But where other historical fiction manages to successfully create fictional heroes and put them in historically accurate settings, THE PATRIOT simply misses the mark.  Apart from being bad history, it's just bad drama.  Both villain and hero are more caricature than character.  Worse, the resolution of the personal conflict between them is hopelessly contrived. <p>Having said all this, it's not that you won't have a good time with this movie.  It's a watchable film.  You might even come out with a visual understanding of why the French were strategically important to the final battle of the war, or what it felt like to be in Revolutionary combat.  You'll definitely exit with a sense of the importance of the Carolinian part of the war.  But I guarantee you that when the credits run,  you'll immediately say that the film could've been much, much better.  <p>[DVD NOTES:  Frankly, you learn more about the history of the times watching the extra features than watching the movie itself.  The "True Patriots" vignette is particularly rewarding, as it gives a sense of the efforts taken by everyone but the writer to imbue the movie with a sense of authenticity.  The director/producer commentary is worth hearing, but I found it hard to listen to at times.  I found Director Roland Emmerich's accent very off-putting, as he peppers his speech with an unbelievable number of "you know"s and "kind of"s and "like"s.  Seriously, for every five words he says, only one conveys actual meaning.  It's like listening to Hans and Franz, from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE . . . for two hours.  Plus most of what he talks about, curiously, is history, not filmmaking.  It's producer Dean Devlin who gives the most insight into the actual filmmaking process.  It's still worth listening to, of course, but it doesn't rank among the best commentaries ever included on a DVD.]</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Amiable comedy"></head><body><p>I found "Failure to Launch" to be more entertaining than many romantic comedies out there.  Hey, where else would you get to see four, count-em-four separate animal attacks?  And Terry Bradshaw's hinder?  Matthew McConaghey plays himself yet again, but he does it so well.  He is the poster child for laconic and amiable.  Sarah Jessica Parker is also entertaining.  But Zooey Deschanel steals the movie as Parker's odd roommate Kit, in many ways playing the same character she did in "Elf".  None of "Failure to Launch" is particularly new material, but it is handled well.<br /><br />At under 100 minutes, "Failure to Launch" thankfully does not overstay its welcome.  Indeed, it is refreshing to watch a comedy that does not kill the audience's goodwill by dragging way past the magic 90 minute mark.<br /><br />This is not a classic comedy; you will almost certainly prefer to rent this than own it.  Odds are, you'll forget you ever saw it a couple of months later.  However, it is light, entertaining and funny, and worth a watch.</p></body></html>

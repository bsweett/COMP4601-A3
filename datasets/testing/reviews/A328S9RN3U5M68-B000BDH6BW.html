<meta name="summary" content="Brotherhood and  Revenge: A Study in Fighting Crime"></head><body><p>John Singleton has a gift for depicting the gritty side of life and making it credible: there are reasons for heads-up defensive action in neighborhoods where perpetrators and victims live side by side in a world teetering on imbalance.<br /><br />FOUR BROTHERS is a finely tuned, taut little film that demonstrates the influence of a caring adult on kids with little future can impact lives.  Evelyn Mercer (a terrific Fionnula Flanagan) is a single woman who adopted four orphans as children and raised them tightly bonded brothers: two are white (ex-con Bobby - Mark Wahlberg - and gay musician Jack - Garrett Hedlund: two are African American - (gentle Angel - Tyrese Gibson - and stay-at-home businessman Jeremiah - Andr&eacute; Benjamin).  The four brothers reunite when their mother is killed during a store holdup.  Knowing that the Detroit police are a corrupt organization they take matters into their own hands, seeking out their mother's killers.  Along the way they discover aspects of each other that draw them eventually even closer as brothers.<br /><br />The cast is excellent with fine cameo performances from Terrence Howard and Josh Charles as polar opposite policemen, from Flanagan (who though murdered in the first frames of the film reappears to 'spiritually' influence the brothers), Chiwetel Ejiofor as the bad guy, Taraji P. Henson as Jeremiah's wife and Sof&iacute;a Vergara as Angel's girlfriend.  The story is solid if a bit predictable, but the messages are many about racism, brotherhood, family importance, and awareness of police corruption.  Singleton directs with breakneck speed yet allows us time to get to know everyone in the story.  This is a dandy action film with a heart.  Grady Harp, December 05</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT"></head><body><p>It's hard to believe that the same geniuses who made the incredible "empty NYC" special effects for this movie could also make the cheesy and unbelievable reindeer, lions and zombies.<br />When Will Smith first enters the dark building and we have a first glimpse of the zombies, no CGI seems to have been applied and they are truly terrorizing. By the later sequences when they climb walls, destroy ceilings, etc. they reminded me of the equally unmemorable "I Robot" effects.<br />Still plenty to like in this movie which for me, unfortunately, will always be remmembered as a missed chance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Corpse Bride"></head><body><p>Another dark, kooky gem from Burton. This has an original storyline and amazing animation. There's great music and so many funny little touches to watch out for. The voices are perfect and the story is fun enough for kids and still manages to engage adults. A worthy partner to Burtons other classic 'Nightmare before Christmas'. Give it a go, you shouldn't be disappointed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good movie!"></head><body><p>OK... I didn't see the previous ones. I was talked into seeing this one and I wasn't sorry.<br /><br />This movie delivers!<br /><br />Along the way, the characters do bring you up to speed as to the story line. So, I did understand what was happening after a while.<br /><br />What I liked most was that this movie moved! It gained speed and didn't stop until it came screeching in to the end. It is special effects laden, but this story could not have been told without all of the special effects.... and they are done well.<br /><br />It is comic book to be sure... so my expectations weren't too high. However, I was pleasantly suprised. They really did a good job with this movie.<br /><br />Not to be taken too seriously in regards to the folklore of vampires and werewolves, it is quite a romp through reaching for the heights.<br /><br />If you have some time to spend and want to be entertained and enjoy a thrill ride, I would definitely recommend this one. Worth every penny of rental. Take it for what it is meant to be and you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

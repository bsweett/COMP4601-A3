Needless to say I held high hopes for the movie and can honestly say I was not disappointed in any way.<p>Jennifer Connelly plays, Kathy, a depressed hopeless woman who suffers loss after loss until she breaks. Sir Ben Kingsley gives a masterful performance as an Iranian man who has had all of his cultural wealth taken from him prior to arriving in the US. You are torn between rights and wrongs in this film and unlike most stories you are allowed to see two sides. Most stories thrive on good vs. evil, here you are unable to decide and the twists that occur leave you wishing you could help both parties. You will cry at the pride and at the despair of human beings facing choices that bind them for life. Brilliant!!</p></body></html>

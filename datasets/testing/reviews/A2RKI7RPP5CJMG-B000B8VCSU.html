However, his performance in "8 Mile," along with the compelling plotline of growing up in a tough, primarily black neighborhood as a white kid, made me respect him a little more than I have in the past.  The story shows us the trials and tribulations of a white kid growing up in a broken home with an alcholic mother in a rundown trailer park.  He faces poverty, racism, abuse from his mother and a myriad of others, as well as the typical doubts of a young man on the edge of adulthood.  This entire film is played out like a country song in rap mode.<br /><br />This is a very fine story.  If you can look beyond the vulgar language(acceptable in this atmosphere), you'll find that there is a gritty and true story to "8 Mile."  Even though Eminem's character has so many tough breaks, you learn that it is with a strong supporting group of friends and believing in yourself that you can become successful at anything you put your heart into.<br /><br />Highly recommended, though there is a heavy amount of coarse language(as stated before, it fits this film).  Also, keep the youngsters away from this film.  It's R-rated for a good reason.  For those concerned, keep in mind that this movie is full of verbal and physical abuse and some very tense moments. It also has a little sensuality in it.  Definitely for adults only.</p></body></html>

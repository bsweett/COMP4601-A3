And you know it is good:  adventure, action, escape, burdens, lost loves, and survival under harsh circumstances.  This is a mix of Robinson Caruso and The Count of Monte Cristo (while Dante is in prison).<br /><br />Federal Express manager Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is shipwrecked for four years.  This story related to his life before, during, and after.  And believe it or not, at the very end, I'll bet you will be wondering about the next chapter as well.<br /><br />Cast Away is a movie investment... you'll want to see it about every third year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE MOVIE SELF-DESTRUCTS"></head><body><p>I had read all the hype concerning the ending of this movie and how it is not a good &quot;remake.&quot;  In watching the film, however, I was totally absorbed with it, until that awful, awful ending.  (More on that later).  Burton's direction is good; the ape makeup is the best ever; Helena Bonham Carter is delightful as the ape Ari; Mark Wahlberg made it through the movie without having to take his shirt off (Charlton spent most of the original in a loincloth, if you'll remember,ladies).  The irony of having Charlton Heston cameo as Tim Roth's dying ape father is splendid.  Paul Giammatti is wonderful as Limbo, and Estella Warren is gorgeous and effective as the beautiful Daena.  I liked the heroism the humans evidenced by the end, and Roth's diabolically manic performance was awesome.<br />Danny Elfman's Afro-influenced score also great.<br />Now, the ending..what makes it worse is that in Tim Burton's commentary, he never actually tells you what in the world he was hoping to achieve with this completely inexcusable ending.  Not only did it negate what we had just viewed, it made Wahlberg's heroic efforts completely useless.  I remember in the first when I saw the crumbled Statue of Liberty, my mouth drop opened and the full impact of the movie is irreplaceable.  Burton's enigmatic ending is just so far out of left field and so preposterous, it destroys what could have been a film Burton could be proud of.  For true impact, watch the original, not that it's better, it's just that it makes sense.<br />Shame on you Tim!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is SO not New Yawk"></head><body><p>Every once in awhile I see a movie about some particular horrible circumstance and wonder...if I had actually experienced what happened on screen, would I enjoy the film? Do war movies seem as thrilling if you've been in a war?  Are movies about terrorism or a hostage crisis as entertaining if you've actually been a victim? Does a movie about a phone booth in New York City seem as authentic if you're familiar with New York City?<br /><br />Phone Booth has one hook - the phone booth.  It's a one-act play with a camera singularly focused on its star.  If fifty percent of the film is the location, the other fifty percent is that actor.  Phone Booth manages to mess these both up in astounding ways.<br /><br />The first problem is that Phone Booth takes place in New York City but wasn't filmed in New York City. This is immediately obvious to anyone familiar with New York City. It's not New York City - it doesn't feel like it New York City, it doesn't look like New York City, and there's a big honking LA bus in the background at one point.  We're supposed to focus on the fact that the phone booth is the remnant of a bygone era, about to disappear forever because it is too slow, too old, too calcified with the advent of mobile phones. Instead, all I could focus on was how this was so not New York City.<br /><br />It's what people who don't live anywhere NYC think of it though, complete with hookers screaming at people. And that's who the movie is for - folks who don't actually live in the city.  It's also very much a pre-9/11 film.  For anyone who lives in NYC, the police response in Phone Booth is an insult to the officers who protect the city every day.<br /><br />If Phone Booth fails on a purely geographic level, the rest of the film's burden is squarely on the shoulders of the lead.  It would make a lot of sense for that lead to be a New Yorker, but it's understandable that the director might cast a wider net.  You'd think though, that he'd at least try for an actor who is a U.S. citizen.<br /><br />But no, we get Colin Farrell as Stu Shepard.  Farrell can't fake a New York accent to save his one-dimensional character's life. Worse, Shepard is a stereotype - he's what people think publicists are like.  So Shepard's a bed-hopping, money-grubbing, smooth-talking "operator" who makes connections, breaks hearts, and gets it done, baby.  He is a walking, talking archetype in a cardboard city backdrop.<br /><br />That leaves our villain, the silky voice on the phone.  Kiefer Sutherland's purr is perfect for this part, although he seems a little too fond of cocking his rifle without ever un-cocking it. That's not enough to save the preposterous plot, which is a deconstruction of a slimy human being with the ever-present threat of violence. Sutherland's character creates a moral quandary by forcing Stu to choose between his mistress (blank cipher Katie Holmes) and his long-suffering wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell).<br /><br />The only other relief comes in Forest Whitaker as Captain Ed Ramey, who shows some modicum of introspection and character development. Ramey stands head-and-shoulders above all the other characters because they're all so unlikable. The sniper doesn't even seem to have a motive - he's more the righteous voice of the audience's moral rage against "city people."  We're meant to sympathize with him as he strikes down pimps and publicists, but really this is about making the audience feel better about not living in a big city.<br /><br />And that's who this movie is aimed at.  If you think that New York City is filled with pimps, prostitutes, and publicists, that snipers are lurking from every window, and that New York's Finest are incompetent boobs, this movie is a passable thriller.  For the rest of us?  It's a pale imitation of the real thing.</p></body></html>

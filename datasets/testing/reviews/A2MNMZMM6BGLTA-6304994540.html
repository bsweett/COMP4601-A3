Jeff Bridges should have got an academy award for playing the laziest,slacker, burn out of all time. From top to bottom this movie is GREAT. Sam Elliot as the narrator, John Goodman as my dad... er I mean as Walter the Viet Nam vet who flys off the handle at everything, Steve Beuschemi as Donnie ("Shut the 'F' up Donnie), The Big Lebowski and his henchman Phillip Seymore Hoffman, Lebowski's wife Bunny, The Nihilist, John Tutturo as Jesus the bowler (don't 'F' with the Jesus), I could go on and on. All the characters are funny as hell and origional. The story is hilarious. The dialouge again, hilarious. The direction by the Coen brothers is fantastic. This movie could actually be perfect if their is such a thing.</p></body></html>

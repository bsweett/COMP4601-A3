I had wanted to see this film upon it's release but was unable due to the fact that it was released in very few theaters and only for a short time (at least in my area) but I was able to find it in stock at my local video store last night and was immediately spellbound by the direction this movie took.  I'm tempted to say that this was even more intoxicating than `The Prestige', but I'm yet to make up my mind.<br /><br />Telling the story of undying love set in Vienna as renowned illusionist Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is reunited with his long lost love Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel), `The Illusionist' does a brilliant job of building character and delivering enough twists and turns to keep you intrigued.  Eisenheim grew up the son of a carpenter, poor and banned from seeing his love Sophie.  He leaves town and swears to come back for her, but they are not reunited until 15-years later when she is promised to marry the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) a man known not only for his ideas of ruining a nation and overthrowing his fathers rule but also for his hot temper towards the women in his life.<br /><br />After their chance meeting both Eisenheim and Sophie devise a plan to be together but their plan is quickly being ruined by Leopold and his Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) who is hot on their tail every step of the way.  When Sophie turns up dead it seems as if their plan has been stopped, but now a more pressing task is at hand, trying to find her killer.  In a game of wits Eisenheim and Uhl expertly combat one another and bring so much life to this film it's almost impossible not to become entranced.<br /><br />Edward Norton has always been one of my favorite actors, and here is no exception as he embraces his role and commands his performance, but he's upstaged every time by Paul Giamatti who just dominates every scene.  Just watch them interact at the restaurant, sitting across from one another and conversing, it's flawless, intimidating and utterly captivating.  Take a close look at two masters of their profession delivering the goods.  Jessica Biel must also be singled out for the maturity she brings to her character.  She has truly grown up since `7th Heaven' and deserves all the praise and even accolades she's received because of this, and Rufus Sewell is equally impressive as the oppressive and unlikable Leopold.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, like an old painting, and splendidly brought to life by a talented cast (just listen to the accents, not one of them seems forced or out of place...a true testament to their strength as actors), `The Illusionist' is more than likely one of the finest films of the past year and deserves our utmost attention.  I feel strongly that had this film been released in November or early December it would have made a strong showing in the Oscar race for from the script to the acting to the directing to the strength of the picture itself it truly is a fantastic experience.  Sit back, enjoy and remember...this has all been an illusion!</p></body></html>

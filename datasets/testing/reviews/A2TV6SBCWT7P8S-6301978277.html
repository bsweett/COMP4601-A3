<meta name="summary" content="Simply the funniest movie ever made..."></head><body><p>Recently this movie topped the list of the American Film Institute's top 100 funniest movies ever made. After having seen this a few times I am inclined to agree with them. This movie, quite simply, is the funniest movie ever made! Directed by the legendary director Billy Wilder, with great performances by Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe, and with a fantastic plot and script, movies don't get any better than this!<p>Essentially, Some Like it Hot is about two musicians who are forced to flee after having witnessed a gang murder. In order to get jobs and escape the gangsters, they dress up as women and participate in an all-girls band. The results are sidesplitting as the two men attempt to maintain their act in the midst of a trainful of beautiful girls, having to dance with really strange guys, and finally when around the beautiful Monroe. <p>The acting is great, the script is hysterical, and the situations can never be equaled. This is really America's funniest movie, and if you haven't already seen it - what are you waiting for?</p></body></html>

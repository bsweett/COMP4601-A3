<meta name="summary" content="Great movie."></head><body><p>This anniversary edition is very well done and the added parts fit in well with the film and are hardly noticeable except for showing a sharper picture than the rest of the movie. The soundtrack is appropiate and fit well with the mood of the movie. Only complain is that some parts were cut to make room for the extra footage and it is noticeable. Overall: GOOD.</p></body></html>

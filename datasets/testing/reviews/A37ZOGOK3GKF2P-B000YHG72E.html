<meta name="summary" content="Elf Next Xmas Vacation?  Maybe..."></head><body><p>Holiday movies seem to me to almost be a wasted effort.  A film that only appeals one month of the year.  "Elf" is different.  It has that magic that "Christmas Vacation" has.  A film that I will watch every holiday season.  It will be timeless and never get old.  It is charming and fun for the whole family,  It is cleverly written, tightly directed, and slick production values.  Will Farrell is in top form in the title role.  Director Jon Favreau show his comic timing in his direction and moves the film at a quick and happy pace.  Sit back, drink eggnog and leave Santa some cookies.</p></body></html>

Still pretty damn good, though.  It is very blue and black.<br /><br />-'Underworld' had a stupid plot; 'Underworld: Evolution' has an even stupider plot.  Also, like the original, they make it very tough to know just what the hell is going on in this movie until very late despite the fact that there really isn't all that much to the plot.<br /><br />-The dialogue is either pure cheese or utterly perfunctory, but, you know, who cares.  At one point Selene says, `So the old legends are true...' I dunno about you, but I find that very funny.<br /><br />-This film has more action than the original, but it's a bit more uneven in quality.  The big fight at the beginning in medieval times is pretty damn cool, definitely the best one, but it's somewhat inconsistent after that.  Still, seeing a pack of werewolves fighting a bunch of armored vampires in hand to hand combat is something you don't see too often, and this alone practically makes the film worth a look.<br /><br />-The werewolves look much better this time around.  Course, they looked pretty crappy the first time, but now they look fairly good.<br /><br />-It's got some neat gore.  Not a ton, but it's there, anyway.  I particularly like one part where a werewolf gets his head pretty much ripped in half.  That was cool.<br /><br />-Apparently, if a vampire bites you, it steals your memories.  Huh.<br /><br />-Scott Speedman once again failed to make any sort of impression on me as that vampire/werewolf hybrid guy, despite the fact that he's supposed to be our co-hero.<br /><br />-Kate Beckinsale gets naked, albeit somewhat discretely, but it turns out she looks better in her leather suit.  ( In which, I must admit, she looks pretty damn good.)  As far as her ability as a action hero and protagonist.... ehh, she's serviceable.<br /><br />-The major sex scene in this film is fairly comical, as they so often are.<br /><br />-The vampires in this movie still don't act very, uhh, vampirey very much.  I'm not the biggest fan of vampires, mind you, but if you're gonna have a vampire movie you might as well have them act like `em, rather than just like really tough humans with peculiar fashion sense and funny accents.<br /><br />Yeah, I think I'm done.  This movie is passably entertaining, but not much more than that.  It's also over long despite the fact that it's only like 105 minutes long.  Still, if you liked the first one you'll probably find this to be worth a watch.<br /><br />Grade: C</p></body></html>

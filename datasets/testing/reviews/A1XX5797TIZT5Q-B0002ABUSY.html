Before having seen the actual films, I'd expected this film to be the best of the bunch.  After all, the original Dawn of the Dead was a high-adventure comic-book tale with plenty of set pieces and scope in itself, so how much could they screw it up?  Unfortunately, this one turned out to be the worst of the bunch, by a mile.<br /><br />I'd expected the lack of horrifying ingredients, edge, and risk-taking.  What I hadn't expected was a story devoid of narrative thrust and engaging characterizations.  With the high budgets, long pre-production times and endless rewrites, shouldn't this be the strength of Hollywood features?<br /><br />The Dawn of the Dead remake is first and foremost characterized by its utter lack of interesting characters.  Despite a cast which includes the intelligent, ever-watchable Sarah Polley and rock-solid Ving Rhames, there isn't a single truly compelling performance in this film.  Clearly not the actors' fault, because their characters are big black holes of nothing, indistinguishable from one another.  Mekhi Phifer is especially stuck with a non-character of stunning shallowness, fatally hurt by the wooden presence of Inna Korobkina as his pregnant wife.  The one element that this remake adds to complicate George A. Romero's original zombie concept, and director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn screw it up royally by having these two characters remain complete blank slates.  So when the moment happens, it's more an "Oh, okay" than what it's supposed to be -- an "Oh my God".  In a desperate attempt to make bigger action set pieces and splatter more gore, Snyder and Gunn pile on the characters -- to no avail.  Having something like 16 characters holed up in the mall only serves to make us never care about any one of them.  Romero achieved far more layers and touched on many more facets of the social spectrum with the four characters in his original Dawn of the Dead than Snyder does with over a dozen half-baked characters.  We don't even know most of their names, so they become utter stereotypes -- the "old lady", the "rich boy", the "naked girl", etc.  So when one of them dies, we simply treat him/her as cannon fodder.  When the characters of Ana (Polley) and Michael (a blank-faced Jake Weber) kiss, I groaned out loud -- when did this happen?  Why?  How?  And so what?<br /><br />The story also lumbers along with lots of tiny little obstacles that never add up to anything.  While Romero's original script threw you into the middle of chaos and grips you in a sense of dread from the first minute, it took this remake over an hour before things finally start happening.  And while we're at it, the way exposition is handled in this film is simply amateurish.  "Zombie bites make zombies".  Even if you haven't seen the original film, seems like a pretty easy thing to guess, right?  Well, Gunn's script treats it as if it were a big reveal, a piece of news that will make the viewer go "ahhh".  But I'm willing to bet a brand-new viewer who's never seen the original will have guessed every single one of the setups and payoffs 20 minutes before the film finally reveals it.  And if you're gonna treat the zombie threat as if the Night of the Living Dead films don't exist (a perfectly viable narrative position to take), then work on revealing the zombie threat step by step.  The "little girl attacking the bedroom" scene of this film is just laughable, with no satisfying build and gradual complication.<br /><br />There is one thing this film does well, and that is cinematography.  While the editing is the usual hyperactive music-video nonsense, the look of this film is wackier, less obviously commercial than most Hollywood fare.  And that's a good thing.  While it's still a relatively high-gloss look, the hyper-contrasted look of this film does contribute to the down-and-dirty zombie backdrop.<br /><br />All the story and character issues aside, my biggest gripe about this film is that there wasn't a single moment where I was horrified yet glued -- namely, a single moment of successful horror filmmaking.  Even the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and even Cabin Fever (which I did not exactly like), delivered moments of arresting freakishness and sometimes downright terror.  The remake of Dawn of the Dead did not.  Blood, brains and guts splatter all over the place, but it's all predictable and more loud and obnoxious than terrifying.  So it played more as a slow action film than as a squirm inducer.<br /><br />I didn't expect this film to come up to the standards of the original.  Few, if any, remakes do.  But I did at least expect a film that works on its own terms.  This remake does not -- four or five times I was tempted to turn the DVD off, and I actually did, 50 minutes in, and didn't feel the least bit guilty.  A good film should make the viewer not want to pick up the phone.  This Dawn of the Dead remake is a passable copy, at best, and an uninvolving, loud, semi-interesting mishmash at worst.</p></body></html>

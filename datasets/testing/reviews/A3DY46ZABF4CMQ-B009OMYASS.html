<meta name="summary" content="Flawed but original"></head><body><p>Hostel is a horror produced by Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill), directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), and starring Jay Hernandez (Carlito's Way: Rise To Power), and Derek Richardson (Dumb And Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd).<br /><br />You've heard the story before, so I'll just recap: Hernandez and Richardson play two Americans who, while vacationing in Europe, get stuck in the most gruesome and terrifying experience one can ever imagine. Along with an Icelandic buddy they met during their trip, they are lured to a town right outside Bratislava in Slovakia where the girls will presumably give in to any guy who speaks with an American accent. They meet two attractive locals, and later find themselves chained in a horrifying chamber where men dressed up as surgeons pay to committ random acts of torture.<br /><br />Before watching Hostel, I was hesitant in forcing myself to watch a movie I knew would probably make me nauseous, but to be honest, it wasn't all that bad as they make it out to be.<br /><br />Even though I found Hostel a bit flawed, the idea of the movie is original, the execution is accurate with all the gore and disgust, and the act of revenge in the ending is refreshing...all within 94 minutes of running time.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B-</p></body></html>

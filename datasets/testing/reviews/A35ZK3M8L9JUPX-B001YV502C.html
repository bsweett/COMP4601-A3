<meta name="summary" content="Children of Men (Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Set in 2027, when no child has been born for 18 years and science is at loss to explain the reason, African and East European societies collapse and their dwindling populations migrate to England and other wealthy nations. In a climate of nationalistic violence, a London peace activist turned bureaucrat Theo Faron, joins forces with his revolutionary ex-wife Julian in order to save mankind by protecting a woman who has mysteriously became pregnant. This movie grabbed my attention right from the start, and never let go. Initially, it's the differences of this future world that intrigue. "Children of Men" is a cinematic milestone. Great special effects and an effective soundtrack accompany this heartfelt, moving and thought-provoking movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="History Revisited as Fresh Drama"></head><body><p>The British monarchy is an anachronism.  How in a modern society can we reconcile birth right privilege with progress and democracy?  The two should be mutually antagonistic.  In the long run, the monarchy will first be cast off by nations such as Canada and Australia.  In due course, its days will be numbered even in England.  Yet, in spite of its very anachronistic nature, it continues to draw breath.<br /><br />The film, "The Queen" covers the events following the death of Princess Diana.  We are given an opportunity to look inside both the royal household and within 10 Downing Street.  It was the royal household that could not understand the outpouring of public grief over Diana's death.  It was Tony Blair that dragged the Queen reluctantly into an understanding of this grief.  I must admit that, at the time and still to this day, I cannot myself understand why so many people fell for Diana.  She was an intellectual lightweight who could be moody and self-indulgent.  Her end should have been little more than a historical footnote.  The fact that it wasn't is the real conundrum.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is brilliant as the Queen.  She is totally plausible.  Indeed, the whole cast is quite stunning.  The cast allows the events to unfold while the viewer is swept along for the ride.  And a great ride it is!  Anyone over the age of twenty should be able to recall the events surrounding the death of Diana.  However, at no time is the film stale.  It is tense drama at its best!  I can thoroughly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

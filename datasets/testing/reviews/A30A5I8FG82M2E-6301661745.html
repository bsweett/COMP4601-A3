Now, I know what some of you are thinking:  "Battle for..." is the nadir of the series, etc.  Well, I'm not going to pretend that the extended cut somehow transforms the movie into a lost masterpiece.  BUT it does improve the movie considerably.  This isn't incidental cutting-room footage, but rather very integral material that is vital to the entire "POTA" story arc.  I won't spoil any potential surprise if you haven't seen or heard about the restored footage, but it deals with the mutant humans and the doomsday bomb.  I can't imagine why this material was ever cut from the theatrical presentation!<br /><br />As for the rest of the set, well the real reason to upgrade is the 16:9 transfers and the 5.1 Dolby Digital mixes that the sequels all have.  You can get the extended "Battle for..." separately if the better transfers and mixes aren't essential for you.  But if you look at the cost of the individual "Battle" disc and the cost of buying this new "Legacy" box, you might want to just take the plunge.<br /><br />I love the Apes series, but I balked at the Ape-head mega set.  I HATE the Tim Burton doo-doo version.  I already have the live-action TV series.  Originally there were plans to make the animated series available separately, but that release was pulled.  I've never seen the cartoon series, maybe someday they will release it on it's own.  The Ape-head package looked sweet, but for the cost I'm fine with the upgraded films in the Legacy box.<br /><br />I just wish they had produced a new documentary, the "Behind the POTA" has been reissued to DEATH (even though it is good, enough's enough!  Who (that actually wants it) doesn't have this release in some form by now??).</p></body></html>

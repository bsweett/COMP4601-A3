<meta name="summary" content="An original, bright, comedy"></head><body><p>I should probably start this review by saying that Dogma was forced on me by my best friend, an avowed Kevin Smith fanatic.  Having only seen Chasing Amy before (and enjoying it a great deal), I was quite ready to dip into a movie by the same writer.  It stirred up a fair bit of controversy at the time, although having watched it I can say it's not actually that controversial.  Indeed, it's embracement of all 'ideas' comes almost perilously close to schmaltz.  Saying that, this is exactly the kind of screwball humour I love.  See, there are two disgraced angels (Damon and Affleck) who find a dogmatic loophole through which they can re-enter Heaven, thus ending the world by proving God to be fallible.  So it falls upon Linda Fiorentino's lapsed Catholic, as recruited by The Voice of God (Alan Rickman), to put a stop to their dastardly plans.  Along the way she's aided by prophets (Jay and Silent Bob), the forgotten 13th apostle (Chris Rock) and a muse (Salma Hayek).  All against Jason Lee's horn-headed baddie.<p>The humour comes thick and fast, with some absolutely classic scenes involving Damon's Loki exacting vengeance on a board meeting, Alanis Morissette's God doing handstands after defeating the apocalypse and some very very brilliant pop culture references.  The acting is also crucial, with particular stand-outs including Damon's most freewheeling role yet, Fiorentino treading a fine line between the serious and the comical and Affleck proving that with the right script and a role that doesn't reek of self-satisfaction (Pearl Harbour anyone?) he can be a very likeable, good, performer.  It of course goes without saying that the supporting cast is uniformally excellent.<p>Still, the script does pander to vulgarity several times, which you'll either lap up or resent given the nuance, interesting humour of the rest of the movie.  Smith also has a slight tendency to over-talk his script, as if to constantly to remind us that this is a satire and not something to be taken seriously.  Whilst he points out in an ironic foreword that this should be evident ten minutes in, he still feels the need to hammer it in a little too much.  Saying that though, the serious elements of the story are mostly done very well, thanks in no part to Fiorentino.  Destined to become some kind of cult classic among Smith fans, this is a much smarter and funnier comedy than any of the one I've seen this year yet.  So, whilst not brilliant perhaps, at the very least Dogma is witty, vibrant and original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Disk of a Wonderful Film"></head><body><p>What movie better captures the descent of the victory over the Nazis into the suspicion, paranoia, and corruption of the Cold War?  The movies strange off-angle camera shots, the way the plot twists and shifts who is covering up what and why is simply wonderful.  It is one of those rare movies that absolutely convinces you it is one kind of movie and ends up being another.<p>The always commented upon zither music does contribute mightily to the atmosphere of the film.  So does the untranslated German used throughout the film.  The palpable tension between the occupied Germans, the communists, and the allies is done better here than almost anywhere else.  I think it helps that the film was done at the time all the post WWII occupation was actually happening and still new.  <p>Orson Welles, Jospeh Cotten, Alia Valli, Trevor Howard, and all the rest are wonderful.  And the way Criterion has done the transfer is magnificent. <p>There is also an intro by Peter Bogdanovich, trailers, info on how the restoration was done, some radio shows from the Third Man, and some reading of Graham Greene's treatment.<p>This is a great disk.</p></body></html>

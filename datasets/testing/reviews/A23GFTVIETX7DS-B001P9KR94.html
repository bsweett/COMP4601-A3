<meta name="summary" content="Is it possible?  A devastating look at India *and* a romantic comedy"></head><body><p>This brilliant film directed by Danny Boyle manages to take the harsh reality of life for India's orphans and to create an uplifting film about overcoming the odds and holding on to true love.  Simon Beaufoy's screenplay, adapted from a novel by Vikas Swarup, tells this story brilliantly through the Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?", where Jamal, an uneducated young man, manages to know the answers to some very difficult questions, leading him to the point where he has only one question to win the 20 million rupees.  Why he knows these particular answers and how he got to the game show unfolds through flashbacks, starting with the massacre of an entire village except for Jamal, his brother Samil, and a little girl named Latika. The violent street life that Jamal has known and the love he has lost have uniquely prepared him for this moment.<br /><br />Dev Patel as the adult Jamal and Freida Pinto as the adult Latika create their roles with passion and subtlety, giving the rest of the cast an opportunity to shine next to them.  The child actors are as natural and compelling as their adult counterparts.  Viewers will find themselves alternately looking away from the horrors and then cheering for the way destiny exerts its ironies.  This could have been an extremely disturbing movie -- and in parts, it is -- but the ultimate emotion is pure exhilaration.  Don't miss the cast's final dance number!</p></body></html>

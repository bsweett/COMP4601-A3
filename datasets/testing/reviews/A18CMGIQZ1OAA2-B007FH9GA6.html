<meta name="summary" content="it did was american films do"></head><body><p>yes i loved it but i will not give it a perfect rating because fincher made blatant changes that i found arrogant and unnecessary. im not a director but i dont see how inanimate objects being changed is time saver. i will say that the acting was amazing. they did a great job with what they were given. my only problem was with the directing and screen writing. lisbeth was too open but im certain rooney mara acted as she was told. shes a great actress and id never say otherwise nor would i with daniel craig. i believe it should win awards left and right but i do not hold it above or below the swedish adaptation.  like most american filmmaking i believe it was over the top. I loved the score and i think it helped the film flow. i did roll my eyes at the beginning with the music and the effects during the opening credits because all i could think was "oh fun, theyve turned it into a music  video". i guess they needed something to grab the audience with and the film got past that soon enough. im happy they did an american adaptation of the girl with the dragon tattoo which has become one of my favorite books. I just hope people take the time to read the book. there were alot of things that i disagreed with in the american film but there were also things in the swedish film that i disagreed with. im happy i decided to see the american film despite my original reaction to the idea of one being made. I am gonna buy a copy of the dvd when its released to go with my other dvds of the trilogy. I wont be paying 22 bucks for it though. its over priced for a dvd thats not a special edition.</p></body></html>

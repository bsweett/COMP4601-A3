Much has been written elsewhere about George C. Scott's riveting performance as U. S. Army General George S. Patton, but I shall note too that Scott's Academy Award-winning performance is one of the most memorable I've come across in biographical films. Scott successfully portrays all of Patton's contradictions, from a brash, often insubordinate, military commander to an insecure, often shy, person in private. But Scott's definitive portrayal of Patton is due too in large measure to the superb script written by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North and the excellent directing by Franklin Schaffner, whose other great films include "Planet of the Apes" and "Papillion". Karl Malden's no-nonsense portrayal of U. S. Army General Omar Bradley is a perfect dramatic foil to Scott's complex portrayal of Patton. And not to be missed either is the memorable Academy Award-nominated film score composed by Jerry Goldsmith, featuring his familiar signature theme for General Patton.<br /><br />Admittedly the movie doesn't closely adhere to the truth regarding some of the details behind the campaigns which Patton led his soldiers in North Africa, Italy, France and Germany, sacrificing veracity for dramatic impact and excellent cinematic storytelling. But it correctly notes his keen interest in reincarnation - he believed that he was once a great Roman general - and his insistence on absolute obediance by those serving under him, while he was all too willing to criticize his superiors and colleagues like American generals Bradley and Eisenhower and British general Field Marshal Montgomery. Towards the film's end, Scott's mesmerizing portrayal of the general shows how much Patton greatly disliked his Soviet counterparts, believing correctly that Eastern Europe was about to pass from the grips of one evil empire to yet another. From Patton's brash, foul language-laced speech which opens the film to the final scenes, "Patton" will command your attention, if not admiration, for the greatest American general of the 20th Century.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The real meaning is in the punchline."></head><body><p>A film that is very well built as an action film, though the cops are trapped by the burglars with a microphone brought to them by a released hostage. How can New York policemen be that negligent and sloppy ? Apart from that, and maybe because of that, it all looks very convincing, though we know very fast what it is all about. The point is just to let us get involved in the bank robbery and in the naive unprofessionalism of the police and how they are fooled like little boys and girls that don't play games on their gameboys or consoles. This long and slow building of a logical mesmerizing plot is there to hide the final kick you will get in your brain without even realizing it and this punchline will nicely survive in your subconsciousness without even realizing it is there in your head : the Jews are invisible and dark plotters who do things in the back of everyone and know no law of any kind and no limit at all when they are trying to get some kind of a vengeance. That kind of a subliminal openly disagreeable punchline is absolutely irritating because it reveals the entertaining film you have been watching for more than two hours has a totally different objective and agenda.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne</p></body></html>

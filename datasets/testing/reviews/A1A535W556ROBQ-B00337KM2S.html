<meta name="summary" content="Life in a Backpack"></head><body><p>Ryan Bingham is close to chalking up a mythical 10 million miles on American Airlines when a perky new executive, Natalie, threatens to take the personal touch out of giving employees the boot by turning it into a web-cam experience.  Bingham is a no-nonsense "outplacement representative" who is close to reaching a major frequent-flyer milestone.  He also finds himself wrestling with a cardboard cut-out of his sister and fiance, which they want him to photograph in front of landmarks around the US.  Not to be thwarted from his "magic number," he leads Natalie on a round of outplacements to demonstrate that this is something that can only be done in person.<br /><br />Clooney has become quite comfortable in this type of role, growing ever more attractive with his gray highlights and open smile.  He seems to have met a good match in Vera Farminga (Alex), who similarly has taken on a pleasant "weathered" look, despite being only 36 years old.  The two play off each other like in a Billy Wilder movie.  Social commentary is kept to a minimum, although Natalie feels the brunt of outplacing persons when they are forced to give Detroit autoworkers the heave-ho.<br /><br />Jason Reitman seems more polished now.  He avoids getting overly sentimental, although there was a point where you thought this movie might go the way of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AOV4I">Sleepless in Seattle</a>.  Ryan manages to hook Alex into going to his sister's wedding with him, which to some extent forces him to re-evaluate his own life.  He seems almost to the point of giving up those swizzle sticks at executive class lounges when this airport romance hits some turbulence and he is forced to accept the cards that have been dealt him.</p></body></html>

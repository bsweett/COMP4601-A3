<meta name="summary" content="Good follow-up"></head><body><p>This one has very much the same feel as the first one, which is great. It's a very good follow-up to the first movie without feeling like they're retreading the same ground the whole time.<br />At the end, when Dwayne Johnson's character appears, there is a bit of a problem since CG human faces are still rather hard today, but definitely imperfect back in 2001, but on the whole, the special effects don't distract and do their job quite well. The characters are charming enough and the action fun and frenetic enough that you can forgive a little slip-up in the special effects from time to time.<br />A good watch and a fun movie.<br />[slight spoiler]<br />I do find it a little forced that they decided to make Evy the reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian princess. Largely I think they were trying to find a way to give her character more importance in the story. I don't have a problem with wanting to do that, but this reincarnation thing just felt a little kludged. Not so much, however, to make the movie unenjoyable.</p></body></html>

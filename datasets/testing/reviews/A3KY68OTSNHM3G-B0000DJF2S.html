<meta name="summary" content="An Extraordinary Action Movie"></head><body><p>The heroes of classic 19th century literature come to life in this action-packed adventure film.<br /><br />The year is 1899 and a villan known only as "The Fantom" wishes to launch global armageddon.  He has developed an armored tank impervious to any other weapon, smashed into a London bank, and captured blueprints for the city of Venice.  He wishes to destroy the city and the leaders of Europe who will be attending a conference hosted by the city.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a gentleman known as M (Richard Roxburgh) has recruited a group of legendary superheroes, including adventurer Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery), vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), invisible man Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), immortal Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Tom Sawyer (Shane West), submarine commander Capt. Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), and Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde (Jason Fleming) to track down and destroy the mysterious Fantom.<br /><br />After arriving in Venice aboard Nemo's Nautilis, the group finds that the city is literally collapsing in on itself after several underwater bombs were detonated by the Fantom and his thugs.  The adventurers set off after the Fantom, only later to discover the Fantom's shocking identity.  This discovery throws everything into chaos, as the group struggles with what to do next.  Will the gentlemen succeed in saving Venice, or will the Fantom, who's true identity has been revealed, succeed in his devious plan?<br /><br />I thought this was a very good film.  I've always been a big fan of Sean Connery, and he does an excellent job as the legendary Quatermain.  The other actors in the movie give fine performances as well.  The special effects, including the scenes containing Nemo's Nautilis and Harker's menacing vampire bats, are well-done.  The story is good, and it's fun to watch these legendary literary heroes working together.<br /><br />I recommend this movie very highly.  The story is good and the acting is excellent.  Watch how the literary heroes of 19th century literature band together to fight evil.</p></body></html>

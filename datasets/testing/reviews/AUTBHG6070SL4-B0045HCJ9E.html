<meta name="summary" content="Another Hitchcock classic"></head><body><p>It's one of Hitchcock's later movies. He puts his signature cameo in the first few minutes of the movie, so people will get on with watching it instead of playing the "where's Waldo" game of finding him.<br /><br />It's also an American classic. Some of the scenes have truly become part of the culture's visual memory: the crop-duster chase, climbing across Mt. Rushmore, and of course the train and tunnel. It's a good action movie, 1950s style, with Cary Grant - what more needs to be said?<br /><br />Here in the next century, perhaps a few more things. This is remarkable as an artifact of the cold war, which provided entire basis for the plot. It's also noteworthy as a snapshot of 1950s style. I don't just mean clothes, though the women's styles have a quaint look now. I mean the railroad sleeper cars (do they even exist now?), the Prairie School architecture as the height of sophistication, and the morals of a simpler era. I'm also interested in that chase across that most reconizable of American monuments, as if the gunfire represented an attack on all of America's citizens at once. Well, I guess that's how the Cold War eye really saw the world.<br /><br />Among Hitchcock's movies, it's not the one that builds tension the best - "The Birds" is a lot more nerve-wracking, for example. It's still a good one, for itself and for the 1950s sensibility that it has frozen in time.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Into the Wild"></head><body><p>"Grizzly Man" is a fascinating documentary of Timothy Treadwell,a man who ventured into the "Last Frontier" to commune with the brown bears. Acclaimed director Werner Herzog ("Aguirre,Wrath of God","Fitzcarraldo") ventures not only into the wilderness of Alaska, but the troubling landscape of Treadwell's mind.<br /><br />Timothy Treadwell grew up in middle-class comfort in Florida. He went to California, attempting to get into Hollywood. He drowned himself in drugs and alcohol, only to find salvation through Nature (it's never fully explained) Treadwell is a deeply eccentric character. He filmed himself in his Alaskan refuge, wrestling with belief in God, wishing he were gay instead of straight (and priding himself on his bedroom abilities) Treadwell has pure,childlike joy in the presence of bears and foxes. He has religious reverence for the land. He's a flamboyant, flaming showman before the camera (a very gay-acting straight man--apparently several of his former girlfriends declined interviews). Treadwell's identification with animals- to the point he saw himself as a bear- brought him to a tragic end along with his girlfriend Amie Huguenard.<br /><br />Werner Herzog uses not only Treadwell's personal footage, but interviews his parents, his ex-lover Jewel (who founded Grizzly Friends with him),the coroner,the bush pilot who took him to the "Grizzly Maze." He speaks with an Aleut,as well as a friend from his California days. Herzog carefully crafts the documentary, making it a riveting piece of cinema. There's also some beautiful folk music from Richard Thompson (Fairport Convention) "Grizzly Man" shows that the wilderness isn't always in the great outdoors, but the human heart and mind.</p></body></html>

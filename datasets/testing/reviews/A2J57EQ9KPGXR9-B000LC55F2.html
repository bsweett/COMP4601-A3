<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, well written"></head><body><p>Yep, this is one film that earned its rave reviews. Its a very deep, involving movie, full of twists and turns. The film is not perfect, it is a little slow in the middle, but the good far outwieghs the bad.<br /><br />The one thing that stands out is David Bowie's solid performance as Nikola Tesla, who was "spooky" smart in real life. I rarely see a film that is this well put together with such a great cast. Hugh Jackman's performance was great, starting off as the protagonist of the movie who let obsession turn him into a monster.  Christian Bale puts in another great performance as the rival illusionist.<br /><br />Also, After I watched this movie, I was curious about the scene with the cat. I think it was a clever reference to "Schrodinger's cat" - Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger's famous 1935 illustration of the principle in quantum theory of superposition. Any film that can fit that reference into its story deserves a look.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent on Every Level"></head><body><p>This is one of my two favorite films of 2007 (tied with "Into the Wild") and offers exceptional performances, especially by multi-award-nominated Viggo Mortensen.  Cronenberg skillfully uses the brutal violence to tell the story, but without being gratuitious.  It's fast paced, compelling, emotional and will surely stay with you long after the closing credits.<br /><br />The special features are minimal, but it's still a must-own for modern film collectors and fans.</p></body></html>

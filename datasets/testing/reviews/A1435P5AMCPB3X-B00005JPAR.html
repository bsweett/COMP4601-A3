<meta name="summary" content="Great filmwork and directing, great love story"></head><body><p>This film a pretty original take on an old story line, the search for immortality, and the lengths that one will go for love.  This story weaves in Myan and Catholic beliefs into one giant tale of a man who's wife is dying from brain cancer, and his search for a cure.  She is also a writer, and is writing a tale of queen isabelle of spain's search for a "tree of life", much like De Soto's actual quest for a "fountain of youth".  The tric to the tale that the wife is writing is that her husband has to finish it.  Watch this film, set back, enjoy the effects, and see what comes in this quest for eternal love.  Worth buying.</p></body></html>

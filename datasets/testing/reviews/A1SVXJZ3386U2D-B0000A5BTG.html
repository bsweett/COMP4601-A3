<meta name="summary" content="An adolescent's Movie"></head><body><p>My 11 year old bought this DVD and asked me to watch it with him.  How could I say no?  Actually, the movie starts with a rather engrossing beginning.  Strange things begin happening and affecting living creatures seemingly at random.  If we didn't know the name of the movie we were watching, the possibilities could be limitless.  However, the story-line continues on in a challenging but somewhat believable evolving theory.  Top scientists and struggling scientists team together, analyze the problem, and go warp speed on creating a "Fantastic Voyage" on a global scale.  The special affects to this point are really fairly decent.  It's the voyage itself that taxes the imagination to bankrupcy.  I may have missed a scientific explanation or two but I could never figure out how the vehicle was actually able to sustain its' journey.  My 11 year old doesn't worry about such technicalities but I do.<p>The acting is fair to middling.  Everybody chosen for the journey seems to know each other which is, I guess, in keeping with the theme that it's a small world.  On the other hand, I shouldn't be too rough on a film that the whole family can watch together with at least some of them enjoying it.  If you have an 11 year old son who wants a DVD for his birthday, this is probably a reasonable choice.  After all, I could never get mine to watch "Old Yeller".</p></body></html>

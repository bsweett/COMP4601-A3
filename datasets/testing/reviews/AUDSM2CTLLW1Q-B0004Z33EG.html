They drew first blood."></head><body><p>Before it became one of the most cliche'-ridden action franchises in history, the saga of John Rambo was actually a very compelling and moving one.  Much like actor Sylvester Stallone's other famed movie franchise 'Rocky', this series debuted with a story that was built upon elements of the human condition and focused on the interactions of the main characters.  Where as the sequels in both series resorted to pandering story lines and overblown plot devices, the originals were well crafted.<br /><br />The first episode in the Rambo saga, 'First Blood' (it was not called 'Rambo', despite what many moviegoers think.) tells the tragic tale of a Vietnam veteran's inability to return to a normal life in his own mind and the inability of many people to let him because of their own feelings about that misbegotten war.  John Rambo (Stallone) was a highly trained Army killing who machined who commanded well-trained men and operated high-priced military machinery.  He was Congressional Medal of Honor winner for whom there was no honor to be found when he returned home. All Rambo wanted to do was find an old Army buddy and grab a bite to eat in a small town as he made through and onto to wherever his next destination would be.  Unfortunately, the prejudices and hatreds of a small-town sheriff's department and its vile, redneck sheriff, Will Teasle (played with slimy intensity by Brian Dennehy) just can't leave Rambo in peace.  Teasle harasses and taunts Rambo before arresting him on a nebulous charge of 'vagrancy'.  While in lockdown, the mistreatment his receives at the hand of other members of the sheriff's department triggers horrifying memories of his time in a P.O.W. camp and he snaps.  Rambo attacks the abusive officers and then escapes to the mountains overlooking this sleepy town.  Not content to let well-enough alone, Teasle and his men follow him into the mountains where Rambo's Green Beret training makes the odds of 8 to 1 (and later 200 to 1) turn in favor of the 1.  Teasle was warned: 'Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe.'<br /><br />'First Blood' deconstructs the world as Rambo has come to know it.  It's an unforgiving one for Vietnam veterans and the mercilessness of some people's perceptions of the men who fought that war made the United States as inhospitable a place for them as the thickest jungles in 'Nam.  Rambo wants to forget and move on, but most of all, he just wants to be left alone.  His battle with the sheriff and his deputies isn't about attrition or killing, it's about survival.  He doesn't kill the men after him; he just incapacitates them.  Rambo is the quintessential anti-hero whose plight we can empathize with, if not sympathize.  You understand the world he is facing and what made him flip the way he did.  While certainly not as well known or publicized as its glitzier sequels, 'First Blood' is an underrated gem worth investing 90 minutes in.</p></body></html>

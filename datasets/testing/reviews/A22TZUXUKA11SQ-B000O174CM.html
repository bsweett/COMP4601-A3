<meta name="summary" content="From a person who doesn't like musicals, this one was okay"></head><body><p>I am not a person who likes musicals. The sight of people breaking into song mid-sentence annoys me to no end, and the very idea that people would talk to each other in verse is ridiculous. That being said, I wanted to see this movie because I'm a Jennifer Hudson fan and I wanted to see what all the talk was about. I'm glad that I did. Dreamgirls isn't a cheesy musical. There is no moment when the people are doing something absolutely ridiculous but it's justified because they're singing at the same time. In fact, the singing supports the story rather than the story supporting the singing, which is the main problem I have with musicals. Dreamgirls was enjoyable from start to finish, and I'd encourage those who don't consider themselves musical fans to give it a go.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Many highlights underscore classic Hitch thriller"></head><body><p>Cary Grant did well in Hitchcock's thrillers as his usual suave self, that playing himself to perfection.  North By Northwest makes Grant's fourth and last Hitchcock film, the others being Suspicion, Notorious, and To Catch A Thief.  In this one, he plays Roger Thornhill, who early in the film is mistaken by some sinister men for a certain George Caplan, a double agent.  He is unexpectedly hijacked and taken to a manor house, and interrogated by two men, a Mr. Townsend (James Mason) and his assistant Leonard (Martin Landau).<p>Before long, Thornhill is falsely accused of murdering a UN official and goes on the lam.  Fortunately, he gains an ally in Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint), a slender, sophisticated-looking blonde, who conceals him aboard a train, and all because he has a nice face.  However, she seems to be playing more than just one side, as he discovers later.  Things build to a point when Thornhill says, &quot;I'm an advertising man. ... I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives, and several bartenders dependent upon me, and I don't want to disappoint them all by getting slightly killed.&quot;<p>The U.S. Intelligence Agency is aware of Thornhill's innocence, but decides to use him as a decoy to protect their double agent, now infiltrating Van Dam, the villain of this movie.<p>There are lots of innuendos in this film that are pretty risque for 1959.  Eve tells Roger, &quot;I'm a big girl.&quot;  He says, &quot;And in all the right places too.&quot;  In fact the seduction scene in Eve's sleeping car is steamy for the era, but the Hays Code rears it head at the last moment when at the mention of one bed, she makes it clear Thornhill will sleep on the floor.  However, Hitchcock uses Freudian dream symbolism to thumb his nose at the Hays Code when in one scene, he has a train going into a tunnel.  Figure that one out!<p>The suspense element involving Thornhill escaping one situation after another, having a brief pause, only to have to hide or face some new danger keeps this film going.  And the climactic scene at Mount Rushmore is a classic, as is that now-famous scene that innocuously begins when a man waiting at the same bus stop as Thornhill remarks &quot;that plane is dusting crops where there ain't no crops.&quot;  Hold on to your hats!  Oh, and the auction scene is both humorous but clever, once one realizes the motive for Thornhill's actions.<p>One funny scene involves a familiar portly older man missing the bus after the opening credits.  Guess who that is?  And Thornhill's lie to Eve on why the police are chasing him:  &quot;Seven parking tickets.&quot;  However, I've observed some ridiculous things.  One, the best way to conceal yourslf if you're a wanted murder is to wear dark glasses.  Uh-huh, right!  Another is, if the person you're talking to suddenly gets killed by a thrown knife, don't touch the knife--you'll be blamed for the murder.<p>Other assets here include Bernard Herrman's music score.  I wonder if Phillip Glass got some inspiration here for Koyaanisqatsi, as some of the frantic violins in NbNW echo that over movie.  Herrman's score at the beginning has echoes of Stravinsky, matching the drawn grid patterns that gradually turn to the glass windows of a New York skyscraper.  A lengthy thriller with some slow pauses inbetween.</p></body></html>

It starts out so goofey! &quot;They're coming for you, Barbara!&quot; And Barbara is such a silly chicklett. But still, it's good, there's a reason it's a classic. The plot is clumsy, the attempts at science laughable even then, the acting is from the Charlton Heston/Captain Kirk school. But it still has that something special.</p></body></html>

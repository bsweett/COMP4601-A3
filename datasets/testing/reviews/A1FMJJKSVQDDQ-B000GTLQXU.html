Everyone now walks on ceilings, and the only way out of here is to travel upwards until the bottom of the ship (technically the top of the now-sunken ship) is reached. I've seen both the original 1972 version and this new 2006 remake, and I have to say that I prefer the original. Poseidon isn't really terrible, but it has plenty of faults. The acting is poor, the characters are unlikable, and the dialogue feels forced. The special effects, however, are much better than the effects in the original. There is a lot of computer effects that almost look real.<br /><br />I guess you can say that I found this to be an adequate film overall. It doesn't live up to the original, but it's worth it if you're looking for a standard popcorn movie.<br /><br />Grade: 5.8/10</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The North American masterwork of the year!"></head><body><p>"Michael Clayton" has been until this date the finest American film that I have seen this year. Supported by a zealous and well made script, the film by itself is quite ambitious in its proposal, but still it gets to engage the most exigent viewer. Supported by a very delicate issue that deals with the destructive and irreversible consequences of a herbicide that generates collateral damages in the human body, all a series of cautious chess movements in order to avoid a major scandal far beyond we know as "fidelity of mark" that eventually led not only to a financial disaster, but besides an irreversible loss of market placement.<br /><br />Of course the movie offers us other several secondary lines. Clayton is our legal antihero, a consummated gambler who belongs to the lawyer's office of this questioned company.<br /><br />So as more we realize what 's bellow all this complex drama, we will witness one of the most memorable performances in years, an absolute tour de force acting by Tom Wilkinson. He literally steles the show although his character is secondary, but transcendentally decisive in the plot .<br /><br />George Clooney gives us the finest role of his career, as this attorney who precisely doesn't represent the impolite side of the law. The rest of the cast is formidable too, with special kudos to Sidney Pollack and the ruthless female legal advisor (Tilda Swinton) .<br /><br />Tom Gilroy emerges as one of the most promising talents of this demanding activity, and although it's too risky to make long term forecasts, I guess this must be the Best Movie the next year (Golden Globe and Academy award), Wilkinson must win as Best supporting Actor in both prizes, and George Clooney should be embracing the golden little statue.<br /><br />Totally recommended, even for those people who use to go to the movie a half dozen times by year. Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

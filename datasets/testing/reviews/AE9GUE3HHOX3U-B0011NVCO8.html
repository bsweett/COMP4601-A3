The acting was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of either Denzel or Russel Crow.  That's not saying they are "bad" actors, I'm just "not a fan"!  I thought the movie became hokey during certain parts, like when Denzel walks out of the church when he finds out they're on to him, and "Amazing Grace" is being sung by the choir in the background.  Hollywood seems to overuse the beautiful hym in alot of films, and it's becoming corny, like, oh no something traumatic happened, cue "Amazing Grace".  Use something original to evoke emotion, instead of relying on the easy way out.  They also used "110th Street" in the film, which was used in Jackie Brown!  It's like whoa, it's too soon to use that cool song in a movie again.  Blatant.  My favourite parts of American gangster were the scenes with Ruby Dee.  (All 2 of them).  For them to nominate her for this role is bizarre.  Ruby Dee was so much better in "Jungle Fever".  Her character was similar to the one in this movie but it was much more dynamic in Jungle Fever.  Why didn't they nominate her for that role, huh????  Oh yeah, it's a Spike Lee movie, I forgot.  Ruby Dee also had a much better role in "The Stand".  She is just a fantastic actress. And that's the good part, now for more bad...  The end of the film seemed a bit rushed and just didn't end on a good note.  It sort of made the whole movie collapse on itself. This is good for a one time viewing, the story was interesting, but been done before in a lot of other films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I Don't Like the Way Teddy Roosevelt is Looking at Me.""></head><body><p>Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) leads a boring life.  The highlight of his week is the play he will be attending with his mother.  But when he pops into the club for a quick drink before the show, he is kidnapped.<br /><br />When he arrives at a country estate, his kidnappers start calling him George Kaplan.  Roger has no clue who Kaplan is and says so quite forcefully.  Whether they believe him or not, he is forced to drink bourbon and left alone in a car to die.<br /><br />The only problem for them is he survives.  Determined to find out what the heck is going on, he sets out trying to track down Kaplan.  His efforts land him as the prime suspect in a diplomat's murder.<br /><br />With his only lead being a hotel room in Chicago, Roger sets out cross country by train.  It is there he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a beautiful woman with a secret of her own.  Can Roger find the truth?  Maybe, but he will have to face low flying crop dusters and a chase across Mount Rushmore to do it.<br /><br />This is my fourth Hitchcock film, and the first one I enjoyed.  The story starts rather quickly and is confusing enough that it held my interest the entire time.  Yet is also has some very witty banter and a great romance between the two leads.  The acting is superb, easily drawing me into the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it suffers from a common curse of movies from that era, pacing.  While I found parts of it rather gripping, I found the parts on the train dull and slow.  Yes, it was developing character and building the romance.  But I still found my mind starting to wander.<br /><br />I was about to write Hitchcock off entirely, but after this film, maybe I'll give him another chance.  If you are also unfamiliar with the work of this legend, this might be a good place to start.</p></body></html>

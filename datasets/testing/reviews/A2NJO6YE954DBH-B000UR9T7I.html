<meta name="summary" content=""Spider-Man 3": flawed but generally absorbing comic book movie"></head><body><p>When the review of "Spider-Man 3" in our local paper came out and trashed the movie I was braced for the worse, although since there were four midnight showings on opening day it seems obvious this movie is going to make a lot of money (at least this first weekend).  But I really did think it would be nigh impossible for this 2007 film to be better than its 2004 predecessor, which is my favorite comic book movie to date (a verdict I render as someone who teaches comic books in general and Spider-Man in particular in my Introduction to Popular Culture course).  "Spider-Man 3" certainly has its flaws and it is not as good as "Spider-Man 2," but those things do not add up to the film being a disappointment.<br /><br />For Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Spider-Man these are the best of times.  Spider-Man is beloved by the people of New York City and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) has given Peter the engagement ring that she received from Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) a half-century earlier so that he can propose to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  But Harry Osborn (James Franco) knows that Peter is Spider-Man, believes Spidey killed his father Norman (Willem Dafoe), and has found the secret Green Goblin hideout.  So right off the bat he comes gunning for Spider-Man.  This seems like they are trying to wrap up a loose plot thread from "Spider-Man 2," but this is but one of the several major pieces this movie puts in place for the endgame.  Meanwhile, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) has broken out of jail and become the victim of one of those classic comic book situations where science turns a man into a monster, in this case the Sandman.  When Peter finds out it was Marko who actually shot Uncle Ben he takes his first step off the deep end.  Peter also has problems in that ambitious Eddie Brock, Jr. (Topher Grace) wants Peter's job as a photographer at "The Daily Bugle," where J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons).  Then there is Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a classmate of Peter who gets rescued by Spider-Man and has a big old crush on the web-head, and the sticky black thing from another planet that has attached itself to our hero.  No wonder the movie runs 140 minutes.<br /><br />Director Sam Raimi pours on the special effects in the computer generated fight sequences.  What made Doctor Octopus a great villain for a Spider-Man movie was how the two could fight on both the horizontal and vertical axises.  Obviously that continues with Venom and to a lesser extent with Sandman, but what those two villains have in common is the fluidity of their "costume" and "body" respectively.  They have fun making Spider-Man's costume all torn and tattered, but that is nothing compared to what they are able to do with Sandman's face and body in these fight sequences.  When Spidey fights the New Goblin (and there is a reason Harry is not running around as the second Green Goblin), it looks more like a high-speed video game with everything happening faster than the eye can see (compare that with the great fight between Peter and Harry when they are not wearing their costumes).<br /><br />For me the problematic character is Gwen Stacy, because in the original "Spider-Man" comic books Gwen was Peter's girlfriend long before Mary Jane became his wife.  Given the relatively small number of Spider-Man movies that you can make, it made sense to skip Gwen and have Mary Jane there from the beginning, even if it meant turning her into the girl next door instead of the sexy redhead in the go-go boots.  But we now know that Peter ends up with MJ, just like we know Clark Kent ends up with Lois Lane and Bruce Wayne is never going to get married.  So Gwen's mere presence is problematic because she cannot be the woman he loves who dies because he is Spider-Man.  In the "Ultimate Spider-Man" comic book MJ is there from the beginning too, knowing Spider-Man's secret identity, and the integration of Gwen's character into that revision of the story was okay, but it did not have the significance or resonance of the original storyline.  The movie Gwen is more like the comic book Mary Jane and that whole plot line would have worked better with Betty Brant (Elizabeth Banks) or an entirely new character than resurrecting Gwen Stacy.<br /><br />Besides the delicious irony that the blond Dunst has died her hair red while the redheaded Howard has gone platinum, I was bothered by how they had Gwen be a model.  Mary Jane was the model and that was important because just like Peter it was a mistake to take her at face value.  Instead Dunst gets to sing a couple of songs and while the movie agrees she is not good enough to sing on Broadway it seems a strange way to create a crack in her self-confidence, especially given that nobody faked self-confidence better than MJ.  But they are fully committed to the idea of Mary Jane as the girl next door even if they have yet to figure out what that means for the character and her relationship with Peter.  Howard is not given much to do, although her last moment is her character's best, and the same goes for James Cromwell as Captain Stacy.  But Bruce Campbell completely steals his one scene, Mageina Tovah as Ursula steals a couple, and Stan Lee has his best "Spider-Man" cameo to date, but Dylan Baker's Dr. Curt Connors is still no closer to turning into the Lizard.<br /><br />The main element they have kept from "Spider-Man 2" is the idea that the conflict between Spider-Man and his foes is no longer black and white, but shades of gray.  I liked that for once Doctor Octopus was not a ranting lunatic with mechanical arms but a good man turned evil by a fateful accident (the flip of what happened to Peter Parker) who refuses to die a monster.  It was that moment more than Mary Jane discovering that Peter was Spider-Man that really gave "SM2" its weight.  This time around there are important shadings for Flint Marko and Harry Osborn, just as there are for Peter Parker as his black Spider-Man costume gets the better of him (but Eddie Brock, Jr. is bad to the bone from start to finish).<br /><br />In the end I round down on "Spider-Man 3" because I think they are overdoing it with Spider-Man's mask coming off or being half torn (even though I understand the impulse to have the face of the actor you are paying millions to actually appear on screen), the comic relief from spectators during the big battle at the end gets in the way of the developing tragedy, and the fade out scene was by far the weakest of the series to date.  I am also not happy with the way Peter's character is regressing, because even before the symbiotic flips him to the dark side he is embracing his inner nerd way too much.  Maguire is hysterical when he has Peter strut himself down the street, but it rings wrong for the character.  Also, even with the swelled head he is getting from the public adoration as Spider-Man, I do not want to believe that having the costume on when he receives the key to the city was enough to let Peter betray MJ the way he does there.  The scene later on at the Jazz club is the insult; it was the other that was the real injury part of the equation.  Still, I bet I make it back to the theater to see this one again.</p></body></html>

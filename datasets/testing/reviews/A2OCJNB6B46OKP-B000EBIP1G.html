<meta name="summary" content="Pretend it's A Movie... (Pt. 1 of *hopefully 7)"></head><body><p>Fantasy is probably the best type of story telling out of all the work that has been put on pages and movie screens. With cinema reaching its peek with technology and special effects finally the greatest of the classic fantasy tales can be told. Flying off the coattails of probably the greatest epic ever created: J.R.R. Tolkien's `Lord of the Rings', comes his true life friend C.S. Lewis's Epic: `The Chronicles of Narnia'.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia is 7 stories of a fantasy world that has been under the ruling of Jada the White Witch who was told of a prophecy. Four Human Children would find their way to Narnia and when they did they would allow the true ruler of the world to rise and they would rule along side him as royalty. The first movie `The Lion the Witch & the Wardrobe' is actually the 2nd chapter of the Chronicles and in this story the prophecy is fulfilled. The Pevinse siblings who were sent to the country side of London during WWII stumble upon the world of Narnia through an old wardrobe in their foster home. Then their journey beings as they encounter talking animals, incredible dangers and fantastic magic at every turn. Then the true adventures of Narnia begin.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me I had to miss this movie in the theaters. Being a true fan of the epics like `LOTR', `Harry Potter', `Star Wars' etc, I was eager to pick up the DVD. Unfortunately, people were giving this movie a bad rap. One reason was because it was from Disney, two people were talking about the large amounts of Christian overtones and of course people thought it would be extremely childish and toned down. For once in your lives people, try to forget all of that and just pretend it's an actual movie? I don't think that the people who put this movie together would have wanted to ruin the true story at all. The movie was very well done, it was not the best movie I had ever seen, but it was fun it was exciting and it was not Disneyfied at all. If you are into fantasy and happen to have actually read the book then I am sure you will not be disappointed. If you think about it, no one really was. Because with all the bad rap, Narnia remained in the theaters in the top 10 movies for 4 months and `The Prince Caspian' is set for December 2007 release.</p></body></html>

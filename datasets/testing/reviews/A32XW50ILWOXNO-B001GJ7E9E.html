<meta name="summary" content="One shabby, patched-together piece of goods"></head><body><p>"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is a massive fraud thrust upon the naive moviegoing public who'd laugh every second to Sunday at this ludicrous thing if it didn't star Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Whole chunks of the plot aren't just missing - they've gone fishing. Don't fool yourself: The end of this movie is some cobbled-together compromise of a disastrous shoot; it resolves nothing, it's about nothing and involves no clear villain. Whatever it is writer Simon Kinberg created with this script, director Doug Liman used about half of it. The rest is bullets, Pitt's blue slushie eyes and Jolie's alien physique. This puppy's "Gigli" with nifty guns.<br /><br />John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) have hit a lull in their marriage. They're bored with each other, predictably so, since they're contract killers for rival death squads and neither spouse knows the other's profession. Not-so-coincidentally they're led to the same place for the same job, after which they discover each other's identities. Then they fight, a lot, trash their house, blow it up, make up, and then realize they're bosses are targeting them. Cue up elaborate car chase and final showdown in, yes, a sporting goods store against a slew of masked men. End of picture.<br /><br />Once upon a time "Mr. And Mrs. Smith" starred Keith David and Angela Bassett as Jolie and Pitt's respective bosses. Their roles have been lopped off. Gone. Vince Vaughn and Kerry Washington, the best friends, play no role in the final act. It could be said we have no idea who the masked men are in the final scene, or who hired them. They don't speak, they get shot. Movies aren't required to have plausible stories, but if a contract squad is after you, much less two, chances are they'd be a little more subtle about it than this.<br /><br />The leads have requisite chemistry, but this Jolie "blue steel" persona is getting a little old. Here's a woman with pedigree and talent wasting time as the ice queen in forgettable B-movies. Pitt slums, too - it's been six years since "Fight Club" - but he has a humor about it. Jolie reserves whatever warmth she posseses for food missions and refugees.</p></body></html>

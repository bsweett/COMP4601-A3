<meta name="summary" content="Cliff-Hanger Train Ride"></head><body><p>Unstoppable" is basically a story of a unmanned train out of control and the race to stop it by a young conductor (Chris Pine) and a engineer (Denzel Washington) that is about to retire.  The movie is a 90 minute thrill ride as we watch police, helicopters, news stations and all the Pennsylvania Railroad personnel try to stop it.<br /><br />The race against the clock train chase is a great thrill ride if you are in the mood for this type of movie.  It kept the audience spellbound. (Actually, all they had to do was disconnect one of the air hoses between the cars - I did this during an inspired moment while standing between two trailers connected to an unmanned truck that started rolling downhill.)</p></body></html>

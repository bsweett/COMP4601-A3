The veteran filmmaker endured the lackluster "Flags of Our Fathers" in order to create this stark, intimate study of the Iwo Jima conflict from a Japanese perspective. Abetted by a revelatory cast and Tom Stern's brilliant cinematography, Eastwood's direction evokes a haunting power exceedingly rare in today's cinema. "Letters From Iwo Jima" transcends its genre as a truly unique and humanistic work.</p></body></html>

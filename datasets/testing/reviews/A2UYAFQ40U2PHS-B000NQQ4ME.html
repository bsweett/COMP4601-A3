<meta name="summary" content="Despite Mel Gibson's possible insanity, this is a great film..."></head><body><p>I initially didn't want to see this, but a friend of mine whose opinion I trust told me it's a great film.  He said "yeah, Gibson's crazy, but he's a great filmmaker".  So I rented it, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This is a great film, a really stunning piece of work that's remarkable in many ways.  There are no big name stars, and most of the actor are non-professionals.  It's primarily told through imagery, and the little dialogue there is is in Mayan.  It's very bloody and violent, though not the gore fest that many critics made it out to be.  It's a very good film, filled with truly awe inspiring scenes, especially in the middle of the film when the action reaches the Mayan city.  The Mayan city sequences alone make the film worth watching, as they are astounding and the best of Gibson's career as a director.  The Mayan city was all a set, one of the biggest ever built, and kudos to the production designer for this magnificence.  After the action leaves the city, the film is still mesmerizing with a great chase sequence ending the film.  The action is well choreographed, the film looks sumptuous, especially for HD video,<br />and the performances that Gibson obtains from his cast of mostly non-professional actors is nothing short of amazing.  They're so natural, realistic, and authentic.  There's no self consciousness at all on their part, and this can be attributed to the excellence of the filmmaking.  The costume design, makeup, and set design are all excellent, and Gibson deserves full credit for making one of the most unique films in cinema history.<br /><br />The first third of the film is a bit tired, with silly dialogue and situations that are reminscent of a teenage comedy.  The opening scene is especially over the top with grossness, but after the village is attacked, the film improves astronomically. While I don't like Gibson the person (he's said remaks that are anti-Semetic, sexist, homophobic, and is prone to religious extremism), he's made a great epic here that can stand along Braveheart.  If you don't like Gibson as a person, you should try and put it aside and see this excellent film.</p></body></html>

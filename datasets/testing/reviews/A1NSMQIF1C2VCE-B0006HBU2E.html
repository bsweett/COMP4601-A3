Then a CIA operation goes bad, agents are killed, and Bourne's fingerprint is left behind ... in Berlin. At the same time, his girlfriend is shot in a bullet meant for him, which brings him roaring back to the West to settle matters once and for all, unaware that he's been framed as a traitor who kills CIA agents.<br /><br />So far, so good. Throw in a ripped-from-today's-headlines Russian oil magnate and you'd think we'd be in good company, but neither Matt Damon nor Joan Allen (in a stellar performance) can save this. Things get confused to the point where one suspects the director wasn't really sure what was going on. Some loose ends are wrapped up, there's a lot of really good action and other set pieces, but the whole does not add up to the sum of its parts.<br /><br />I have high hopes that the third part of this trilogy will return it to form. In the meantime, this is a rental.</p></body></html>

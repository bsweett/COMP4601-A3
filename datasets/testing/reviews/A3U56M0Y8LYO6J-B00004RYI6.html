After sleeping on it for the weekend, I finally came to the conclusion that this movie was indeed a triumph.  If The Matrix did not upstage this movie a year later, I firmly believe people would still be talking about it.  I do not agree with Roger Ebert that Dark City was the best movie of 1998, but I do admire director Alex Proyas' efforts to dare the audience to actually use their brains.  Dark City is not filled with pointless car chases or endless gun fights.  It is instead filled with something better - ambitious ideas that force us to question the very nature of reality.  Are the memories we possess really ours and organic in nature?  Or are they synthetic and subject to the whims of chance?  For that matter, does reality exist in and of itself or is it an artificial construct?  Is human consciousness real or do we just think it is real?  Am I the same person I was yesterday or was I someone else?  Do not get the idea, though, that this movie is the visual equivalent of a staid classroom lecture.  Dark City also functions as an exciting movie in its right by combining the best elements of sci-fi and film noir into an engrossing mystery.  Just think of Dark City as a good movie with more of a brain that you might be used to.</p></body></html>

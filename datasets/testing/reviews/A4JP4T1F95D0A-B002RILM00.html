<meta name="summary" content="Just Didn't Get It"></head><body><p>I have never seen the original, so I didn't watch this one with any expectations or anything else to compare it to.  This movie is terrible.  It is not a horror at all.  It dances back and forth between being a supernatural experience, and a simple drama, without ever explaining.  The movie is boring.  Not once did it compel me, excite me, scare me, or give me any reason to sit there and watch.  Cage is fair in the movie, but no one really stands out.  Bascially a quick summary of the movie is that a cop goes to a strange island run by pagan feminists looking for his girlfriend's missing child.  Lot of strange images, fast forward to a crappy ending and role credits.  The shocking ending isn't that shocking.  I saw the twist coming a half hour into the picture.  The dvd ending is very unsatisfying.  I am going to go rent the original.  It has to be better.</p></body></html>

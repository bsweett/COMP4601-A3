<meta name="summary" content="So-So Adventure Aided by Connery's Presence..."></head><body><p>A British comic book with a truly novel<br />premise (literary characters band together to fight evil) becomes a fair<br />action flick that benefits enormously by Sean Connery's presence, but never<br />quite comes together.<p>Part of the problem is diluting the comics mix. Sherlock Holmes' lore is<br />sprinkled liberally through the story, but he is NOT part of the League;<br />secret agent Tom Sawyer (???) is used, instead (I think the filmmakers hoped<br />Shane West's presence, as Mark Twain's Sawyer, would draw teenage girls to<br />the film...it hasn't). Jason Flemyng's Mr. Hyde is not Robert Lewis<br />Stevenson's nondescript but twisted alter ego of Dr. Jekyll prowling the<br />streets, but as big and misshapen as the HULK (hard to believe he could<br />seduce those London streetwalkers!) Peta Wilson is Dracula victim/vampire<br />Mina Harker, but she walks effortlessly in daylight (uh, did somebody forget<br />to read up on vampire lore?) Naseeruddin Shah is the most Middle Eastern<br />Captain Nemo you'll ever see, but the 'automobile' he invents is so clearly<br />mid-twentieth century in design and operation that it defeats the illusion<br />of an 1899 setting. Stuart Townsend's Dorian Gray is fun, simply as a chance<br />to see Townsend imitate Johnny Depp! Tony Curran offers some needed humor as<br />a VERY low-brow Invisible Man.<p>Ultimately, Sean Connery, as H. Rider Haggard's African adventurer, Allan<br />Quatermain, carries the film, and while he's far too old to be as physical<br />as the role requires, it isn't as glaring a flaw as it was in his last<br />action film, ENTRAPMENT. He seems to be having a ball, and at times, you can<br />visualize him as a later-day 007, still kicking butt!<p>Assigned by British government official 'M' (shades of Bond!) to track down<br />an anarchist out to start a world war, the team of specialists race around<br />Europe and the Arctic, facing terrorism, betrayals, double agents, sabotage,<br />and assorted mayhem, while learning to get along with one another. Is it<br />loud? You bet! Is it involving? Well...sometimes...<p>While I feel the critics have been a bit too hard on the film, it certainly<br />isn't as impressive as TERMINATOR 3, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, or X-MEN 2.<br />It will make a fun rental, when it moves to video, tho...</p></body></html>

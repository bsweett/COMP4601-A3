<meta name="summary" content="Apollo 13"></head><body><p>I want to Like this movie A lot I really do but I can't stand Tom Hanks' Mug and Kevin Bacon's And Ron Howard has always left me with a bad taste,nonetheless despite my personal biases towards the cast and also the length of the movie,It has some enjoyable parts and attempts to tell the story,My favorite parts though are the Cameo Appearances of Corvettes throughout,I wish the 1969 Riverside Gold/w Black(made especially for the Previous Apollo Astronauts which is why it's not in this movie-427/390hp Corvette Coupe)would show up in this movie or any,The Apollo 12 "AstroVette"(not the concept car Astro),but that's a minute detail and hardly something that should make or break this movie,I just think it drags on and at times so technical despite being done in a way for most to understand,cut it down an hour and get to the point,I preferred the Movie The Right Stuff which Ironically is Longer than this melodrama of a flick..Would Have been nice to have someone like Clint Eastwood instead,but I digress I ask too much.</p></body></html>

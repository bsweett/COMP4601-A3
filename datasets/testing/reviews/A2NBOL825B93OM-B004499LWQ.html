When the lies are so real that you start to live them and forget what your life was? Those are some of the questions proposed by Mike Nichols "Closer", a drama movie featuring four talented and beautiful actors - four "hollywood sweethearts".<br /><br />Dan (Jude Law) met Alice (Natalie Portman) in the street. She suffers an accident, and they get together. Dan becomes a famous writer, and he has to get a photo for the back cover of his book. Anna (Julia Roberts) is a photographer. Anna and Dan meet, and they fall in love, even though Anna starts dating Larry, a lonely and rich doctor.<br /><br />There's more to "Closer" than that. Much more. Plot-twists and love-twists. Lots of them. The movie is based on a play by british author Patrick Marber, so there's little room for settings and locations, and much room for character development, and, most of all, dialogue. There are several fantastic lines in the movie, and some memorable scenes. It's interesting to see how the four characters relate to each other, because they are very much like us, common people, and what they are going through could happen - or have already happened -  to almost everyone.<br /><br />Clive Owen and especially Natalie Portman provide amazing acting. The direction is average, but the movie as a whole is very good, although somewhat depressing. The viewers become painfully aware of their own weakness when confronted to the ugly aspects of life. But that's life.<br /><br />Grade 8.7/10</p></body></html>

So myself and three friends went to see it earlier, and when it ended, I thought one thing: WOW!  This was such an amazing movie, with amazing visual effects, a perfect cast, and tons and tons of testosterone-induced action.<br /><br />WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez co-directs (along with Sin City creator Frank Miller, and with Quentin Tarantino as a "Special Guest Director") what is, without a doubt, the most faithful comic book adaptation ever.  In fact, Rodriguez sees this film as a translation rather than an adaptation.<br /><br />There really isn't a central plot; rather, the movie is about 3 seperate stories that share certain characters and all take place in Basin City, the most morally bankrupt town ever, which rightfully earns the nickname Sin City.  To call this an all-star cast would be an understatement.  Some of the many actors included in this film are: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benecio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Britanny Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Jamie King, Marley Shelton, and Rosario Dawson (yeah, I know that's a lot), and while some of them have very small roles (Wood and Aoki have no dialogue, although neither of them have a small part), all of them are pitch-perfect in their roles.<br /><br />The movie begins with a short segment entitled "The Customer is Always Right", with Harnett as The Salesman and Shelton as The Customer.  Up next, is the set-up for "That Yellow Bastard", a story about Jim Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a bad heart who is trying to bust the son (Stahl) of a powerful Senator (Boothe) who likes to rape little girls.  Next is "A Hard Goodbye", a tale about a huge brute named Marv (Rourke) who falls hard for a beauty named Goldie (King).  They share a passionate night together, but Marv awakes to find Goldie dead in their bed.  A search for "justice" ensues, with Marv beating the life out of anyone who has information on the hit.  The story also has Gugino as Lucille, Marv's parole officer, Wood as Kevin, an amazingly gifted killer, Hauer as Cardinal Roarke (the brother of the Senator from "Yellow Bastard"), and Sin City creator Frank Miller as a priest.  The second story is called "The Big Fat Kill".  It deals with Dwight (Owen), an ex-photographer (this isn't explained in the film, but there is a graphic novel that sets up the Dwight character prior to the events of this story) and now a sort of mercenary who goes to Olde Towne to help defend Gail (Dawson) and her fellow prostitutes from Jackie Boy (del Toro), a deranged maniac with a penchant for violence against women.  This segment also has Murphy as Dwight's girlfriend Shellie, Bledel and Aoki as fellow hookers Becky and Miho (deadly little Miho), and Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute, a hired goon for an unnamed mobster.  Finally, "That Yellow Bastard" is the last major story.  It picks up after the events of the previous part of the segment.  Hartigan has been sent to prison, because Senator Roarke spun things to make it appear as if he raped little Nancy (played by Alba in her adult incarnation).  Believing Nancy to be caught by Roarke's men, Hartigan gets out and seeks her out to protect her again from people who want revenge upon him for killing (?) Roarke's son.<br /><br />These stories are extremely gritty, violent, and even a little depressing.  (SPOILER)The only one with an ending that could be considered happy is "The Big Fat Kill".  There are scenes involving shootings, stabbings, decapitation (or almost so), even cannibalism.  One guy even gets his genitals ripped off.  Also, there is a lot of full frontal nudity (although, from what I understand, nowhere near as much as there was in the books).  So if you feel in any way uncomfortable with any of the above-mentioned things, avoid this movie.  If not, then I highly suggest seeing this film.<br /><br />As I said, the choice of actors for this film was perfect.  I can hardly think of anyone else who could fill the roles of any characters in this movie.  Although, I must say that Willis, Wood, Aoki, Dawson, and Rourke were the big standouts in my mind (even though, as I stated earlier, Wood and Aoki have no dialogue).  Speaking of dialogue, under any other circumstances, the dialogue in this film would be terrible.  However, the actors and situations make it awesome.  Even though many lines are extremely cliched, and I hate cliches, the delivery is amazing.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning.  The film is shot almost completely in black and white.  Although, every now and then, there are splashes of color (certain cars, Dwight's shoes, women's eyes and hair, one of the villains).  Also, many of the shots mirror the panels from the comics.<br /><br />With all that going for this movie, it all adds up to a great 2-hour thrill ride.  Once again, if you don't mind excessive violence, I would highly suggest seeing this movie.</p></body></html>

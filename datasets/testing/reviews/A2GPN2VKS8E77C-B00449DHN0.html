<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Movie...DiCaprio's Accent Comes & Goes. Same For Cameron Diaz. Finale Was A Downer."></head><body><p>Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This movie from the director of The Age Of Innocence is mildly interesting at best, because of the main premise and the three lead actors: Leonardo DiCaprio, Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. My main problem with this film is that DiCaprio's Irish accent comes and goes. One second, he's sounding like an Irishman and the next, he's sounding like a true American (that's how he ounds during the bits where he's doing the voice-over narration). Cameron Diaz fluctuates between an American and an Irish accent. The only actors who remained consistent with the accents are: Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Broadbent, Brendan Gleeson, John C. O'Reilly and an uncredited Liam Neeson. I don't know any of the history that's covered in the film beyond what I remember from American History in high school, which is very little. I do, however, know a lot about the pilgrims who came to this country from England and Holland on the Mayflower in 1620, the Revolutionary War, the Declaration Of Independence and the Constitution of this hitherto God-blessed country (and still in the process of learning more about it). Worth a one-time viewing only, but Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is nothing less than the best of an incredible actor who goes to great lengths to prepare for a role. SPOILER ALERT!! The finale, in which Amsterdam faces off against Bill The Butcher, is a bit of a downer, as I fully expected a massive and epic fight to the death between these two mortal enemies. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! Rated R.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Meet Damien, the antichrist (he's the one in Cabbage Patch outfit)."></head><body><p>There is an interesting scene at the beginning of "The Omen" remake that involves a Catholic bishop's report to the dying Pope about the emergence of an antichrist. The bishop ticks off the signs - a comet, 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, that big tsunami - with a flashy slideshow, which he ends by saying "our worst fears have been confirmed." Now - why would this bishop have much fear?  Catholics believe the Book of Revelation is found in the Bible because it will happen - because it must - and it's no more to fear than the most obscure verses in Deuteronomy about the treatment of pus-filled scabs. Certainly the son of the devil is to be scorned and hated, but a Catholic bishop shouldn't exactly fear the inevitable unfolding of God's endgame; if anything, he should be solemnly glad that the new earth is near.<br /><br />You can think about these things because the first half of "The Omen" is a sprawling bore and the kid who plays antichrist Damien, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, is about as ominous as a Cabbage Patch doll. Couldn't director John Moore have found anybody else? Couldn't somebody have chopped Dakota Fanning's hair off, dyed it brown, and stuck her in there? The Pope's squirming in his velvet chair over a kid who has all of six lines and scowls by *literally protruding his lower lip.* The Dev' better have a plan B - this can't be the kid.<br /><br />But he is the boy British Ambassador Robert Thorn (Live Schreiber) took home the night his real son was killed by the Satanists. Wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) is the doomed mother who senses, by Damien's sixth birthday, that something is off about a mute boy who inspires nannies to hang themselves off the sides of castles and gorillas to go gonzo at the zoo. Robert brushes these things off as he wears all-black outfits to Katherine's elegant white robes and he ignores a psychotic priest (Pete Postlethwaite) who screams some demonic poem and the line: "His real mother was a jackal!" Do not think you shall be spared the shot of a jackal's skeleton in a shallow grave guarded by possessed black hellhounds. Oh, there will be a jackal's skeleton.<br /><br />This is a faithful remake of the original movie, which causes a lot of thirtysomethings to say "Ohhh, `The Omen,' oooo, that was so...oh my God!" without really expounding on the issue beyond, "Ohhh, Gregory Peck." That's because it wasn't any good either, and screenwriter David Selzer's idea has more traction than his writing of both pictures - the son of the devil, when he comes, isn't going to make this kind of ludicrous, swaggering entrance. The "Harry Potter" series, in fact, etches a more convincing origin story in its evolution of Voldemort. And a chilling movie was made about the birth of the antichrist; it's called "Rosemary's Baby," with Mia Farrow, who stars in "The Omen" as the evil nanny who stares longingly into Damien's eyes while she feeds him strawberries.<br /><br />It's right after this scene that Damien puts a sock in Katherine with his scooter, and Robert teams up with a photographer (David Thewlis) on a scavenger hunt that at least works better than "The DaVinci Code." A particular campy highlight is found at an ancient Italian monastery beyond a misty, snow-crusted lake where a deformed Satanic monk scrawls, in black coal, the location of a cemetery - but not before the church bells toll and we get a shot of Robert searching the walls for intruders. Later they meet a crazy sage (Michael Gambon) who hands Robert a leather pouch of daggers to kill Damien. Robert, who in an earlier scene says "I want Damien dead," has fourth thoughts. But the photographer is more than willing.<br /><br />Which leads to another question: When somebody is decapitated while standing, would their remaining body pause for a moment, slouch, then fall - or would they just drop immediately? My wife asked me this directly after "The Omen." It was her first impression.</p></body></html>

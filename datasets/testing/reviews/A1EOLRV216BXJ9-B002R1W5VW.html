In came Alison Lohman, Roy's never met 14-year old daughter Angela, who reestablisehd Roy's link with the real world. Just when Roy was willing to break his rule - he ventured into the danger zone and did one last big job with Frank, he put his as well as Angela's life in danger. One would even assume the 3 will pull it off...<br /><br />The movie is much more interesting when Angela showed up. Alison Lohman is natural, eager and smart as her papa. Only she was actually 22 when she played the 14-year old. So she is blessed with the youthful look but delivered a sophisticated role. The movie ended up with an upbeat note, with Nicholas Cage losing a lot but gaining something he has never had before.<br /><br />I like the ending.</p></body></html>

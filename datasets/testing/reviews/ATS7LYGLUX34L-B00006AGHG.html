<meta name="summary" content="Road Rage To The EXTREME......."></head><body><p>A simple traffic accident causes two very different men, who ordinarily would never come into each others orbits, to become inextricably linked in a day-long game of cat-and-mouse, with each man's future hanging in the balance.<p>  Ben Affleck plays your typical slimy uptown Lawyer. He's involved in a shady deal, where he and his partners are bilking a charity they're representing, he's cheating on his wife, etc., etc. Samuel L. Jackson is a recovering alcoholic trying to pick up the pieces of his shattered marriage. When a poorly-timed (Both men are due in court- Jackson for a custody hearing, Affleck for the aforementioned Charity-bilking scheme...) lane change on Affleck's part causes the two men to meet, Affleck's rude handling of the situation causes Jackson to be late for Court. He loses custody of his Kids, and it looks as if he may never see them again. But Affleck is missing an important file...it seems as if he handed it to Jackson at the accident scene, and without it, not only might he lose his case, but he might lose his freedom as well. <p> The movie screams along as the two resort to ever-increasing levels of anti-social behavior (Affleck needs the file back, Jackson wants his LIFE back.), and even though it's pretty much a big morality play (Be nice to others and play fair!), it never bogs down into preachiness, and the ending is a nice change from what I went in expecting. Very different.<p>  The performances are solid, especially the ever-dependable Jackson. Sidney Pollack is very manacing as Affleck's boss....<p>A very impressive effort all around.</p></body></html>

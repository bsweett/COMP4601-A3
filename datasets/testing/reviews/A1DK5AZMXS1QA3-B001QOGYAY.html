<meta name="summary" content="Another great outing for Peter Jackson"></head><body><p>Who would have thought a story about child abductions would have made such a beautiful movie, but such is the skill of Peter Jackson.  Based on a famous book by Alice Sebold, this story is set in the 1970's, and is about a family torn apart when one of their daughters is abducted and killed by a neighborhood serial murderer.  The movie is told from the POV of the murdered girl, Susie Salmon, whose spirit floats in the in-between of heaven and earth.  Torn between trying to interfere with events in the living world, and going to heaven, she suffers thru pain, joy, horror, foreboding, and revenge.  Though a drama in its essence, the scenes of Susie enduring in the in-between is pure fantasy with awesome special effects.  The movie also has a great soundtrack with some good vocals.  Overall, a great movie.</p></body></html>

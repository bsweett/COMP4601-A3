Instead of being set in Pre-World War II London, the 2010 version is set in the late 1800s.  Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot.  He has just received a telegram from Gwen (Emily Blunt), his brother Ben's fiance.  The telegram states that Ben has been missing for a considerable time.  Leaving his acting troupe behind in New York, Lawrence returns to Talbot Manor to assist in the search for his missing brother.  Upon arriving, Lawrence's father Sir John Talbot, played magnificently by Sir Anthony Hopkins, informs him that Ben's mutilated body had been found.  Sir John said that the body was mutilated by some sort of beast.  Lawrence discovers that Ben was wearing a gypsy necklace when he was killed.  He takes the necklace to a local group of gypsies to determine its significance.  While there, the camp is suddenly attacked by the beast.  Lawrence is bitten while trying to help, and the beast flees.<br /><br />An elderly gypsy lady tends to Lawrence's wounds and she recognizes their significance; a werewolf's bite was the cause.  According to legend,, there is no cure for the bite of a werewolf.  The recipient then turns into a wolf themselves.  Now, Lawrence must face the horrible transformation each time there is a full moon.<br /><br />In the meantime, the detectives at Scotland Yard have been trying to solve the rash of killings.  The lead inspector, played by Hugo Weaving, is suspicious of the Talbots, and he's keeping close watch on Lawrence.  Sir John, thinking Lawrence is insane, has sent him to a mental asylum to undergo treatment. While there, Sir John visits Lawrence and reveals the identity of his brother's killer.  Lawrence is then bound to a chair and set in front of a large group of observers.  The lead psychiatrist tries to explain away Lawrence's condition, but the appearance of the full moon convinces them.  The inspector is on hand to witness this and barely escapes.  He knows with certainty about Lawrence's condition and sets off to finish him.  Meanwhile, Lawrence has returned to Talbot Manor for a showdown with his father, but sir John has his own surprise in store.  Lawrence's only hope of release is Gwen, but will she be able to help before it's too late?<br /><br />I've seen the 1941 version of The Wolfman, and I enjoyed it very much, and this film is very good as well.  I feel that Benicio Del Toro does a very respectable job in portraying the Wolfman.  One major difference in the two films is that the original movie dealt more with psychological terror whereas this new film has much more blood and gore.  The stories are similar in the aspect that Lawrence Talbot appears in both.  I thought the acting in this movie was very good, especially by Del Toro and Hopkins, and the computer-animated werewolves were scary.<br /><br />I highly recommend this fine reprisal.  Horror fans will surely enjoy seeing the Wolfman on the prowl once again.</p></body></html>

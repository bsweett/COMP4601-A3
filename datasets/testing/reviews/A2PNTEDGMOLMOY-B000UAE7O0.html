<meta name="summary" content="Fun romp through homage to zombie-fest flicks offers chuckles rather than screams"></head><body><p>Robert Rodriguez ("El Mariachi," "Once Upon a Time in Mexico") and Quentin Tarantino (do I need to list references?) have famously teamed up on a number of projects ("Desperado," "Sin City").  While these two cinemaphiles always appear to have a blast making their movies, the "Grindhouse" project may be the paragon of their mad-cap filmmaking self-indulgence.<br /><br />"Grindhouse" was a double-feature in which RR and QT each provided a flick designed to be a homage to the low-budget horror/exploitation films of the 60s and 70s.  "Planet Terror" is RR's entry, although QT makes quite an impression in an extended cameo as a deranged military nutcase.  QT's half was "Death Proof," which I won't review here, but it's definitely of a piece with "Planet Terror."<br /><br />Zombie films are seemingly as popular now as ever, so RR's spoof/tribute is timely.  The flick opens with a hilarious mock trailer for "Machete," an X-rated revenge flick.  The film quality of the trailer is terrible - RR fakes wear-and-tear on the film and includes skips and flaws in the soundtrack as a tribute to the grindhouse experience.  This works fine in the trailer, but as it continues into the feature film, it gets more than a little annoying after 60 minutes.<br /><br />"Planet Terror" opens up with a zombie outbreak in Texas, thanks to military hijinx led by Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis) for reasons unknown.  Soon zombies are tearing across the countryside, rending the innocent and not-so-innocent limb from limb.  Unfortunately, "Planet Terror" is aiming more for humor and gross-outs rather than genuine scares, so be prepared to wince rather than cringe.  Some of the jokes really work, such as several close-ups of the "humps" of Black Eyed Peas singer/ornament Fergie, just before the zombies tear her humps apart.  There's also a clever "Missing Reel," alert, with apologies from theater management, just when a love scene between stripper Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) and Wray (Freddie Rodgriguez) gets its most "exploitative."<br /><br />Ultimately, this is not a good horror movie in that it will not create any genuine terror, a la the original "Halloween," "Nightmare on Elm Street," or even "Dawn of the Dead."  But it must be said that there are two types of horror movies, and this is the second type - the kind that goes for dark humor, ridiculiously-sensational death scenes, and blood by the barrelful.  That kind of horror movie doesn't appeal to me all that much, truth be told, but if that's your game I expect "Planet Terror" will find its way to the top of your DVD stack pretty quickly.<br /><br />For what it is, I cannot imagine a movie doing a better job of hitting its target than "Planet Terror."  It is a tribute to bad taste and bad movies - and for what it is, almost as much fun as RR and QT had making it.</p></body></html>

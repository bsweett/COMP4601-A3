In terms of realism and intensity, the battle scenes are truly state-of-the are and easily merit the same encomia as those in "Black Hawk Down" and "Saving Private Ryan." From a human interest perspective, the film does a wonderful job of portraying the anguish of military families who must face the fear and reality of their loved ones dying in battle. And to the film maker's credit they make a significant effort to portray the Vietnamese enemy as good guys who were just doing their thing. <p>Oddly enough, the part of this movie I object to the most is the one that is frequently showcased in trailers and talk shows. In this scene, the protagonist, played by Mel Gibson, is asked by his daughter why people fight wars. He responds that war is what happens when bad men try to hurt other men and men like her daddy try to stop them. With these words, Mel Gibson not only provides his young daughter with an understandably innocent description of warfare in general, he also distills the entire theme of "We Were Soldiers" into a single sound byte. Mel Gibson is telling us that the Vietnamese were the bad guys and the Americans were the good guys who were trying to stop them.<p>These lines disturb me when I consider the context in which this film was made. "We Were Soldiers" is following the newly blazed trail of neo-war movies that began with films like "Saving Private Ryan". This film and the World War II films that followed reversed three decades of objective, analytical war films such as "Tora Tora Tora", "Apocalypse Now", "Platoon", and "Casualties of War" and instead replaced them with a sentimental, jingoistic view of American military action. This was acceptable enough with "World War II" because there really isn't too much trouble distinguishing between right and wrong in that event. With "We Were Soldiers", however, Hollywood has now attempted to reshape the public's understanding of the Vietnam War along similarly benign and simplistic guidelines. <p>At this point, many readers are probably thinking, "but this is a true story! How can you possibly state that it is misleading?" This is a perfectly valid question to which I would respond first that this film is based on a book which is itself misleading in many ways, and second, it is the EXCLUSION of facts that makes this film misleading. "We Were Soldiers" presents American troops as benign interventionists in a conflict they new little about. In doing this it excludes some ugly realities about what American presence in Vietnam meant for millions of Vietnamese. To begin, with the U.S. Congress estimates that in the course of the war the United States killed approximately 1,350,000 civilians, by all accounts a highly conservative estimate. In addition, there are numerous well documented instances crimes perpetrated by the American military against Vietnamese civilians including rape, murder, theft, unlawful imprisonment, the destruction of farmland, torture, contamination, and forced prostitution.<p>While "We Were Soldiers" is wonderful for all the reasons that an action packed, loosely historical film should be,  it is also problematic. If after seeing this film, you do not want to do some research in the library or online, at least see some films that offer different perspectives of the war. I know that for many of our veterans, unjustly blamed for something that was largely the fault of American politicians this film must seem like a welcome relief. Our veterans do deserve to be acknowledged, and its high time the nation apologized to them for the blame it heaped upon them for doing their duty. But distorting America's role in Vietnam by focusing exclusively on the heroics does not do them a favor. It does the entire country a great disservice.</p></body></html>

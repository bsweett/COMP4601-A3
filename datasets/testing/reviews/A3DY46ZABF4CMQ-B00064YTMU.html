<meta name="summary" content="Miscast actors in a good thriller"></head><body><p>Collateral is a movie directed by Michael Mann (Ali, Heat) and starring Tom Cruise (Rain Man) and Jamie Foxx (Any Given Sunday). Looking at both actors' resumes, I've realized that Tom Cruise hasn't played a role of a villain for as long as one can remember. And Jamie Foxx hasn't been recognized before for being a good actor, not even in a supporting role.<br /><br />I understand that Cruise would want to play the role of a merciless cold blooded killer to expand his acting abilities. But honestly, the role of Vincent does not fit Tom Cruise's character. The role would have been great for someone like Brad Pitt or, for an older generation, Al Pacino. Jamie Foxx does not fit in the entire picture, let alone the role of cab driver Max, a role that would have been perfect for somebody like Samuel Jackson. He delivers his lines like somebody reading off of a cue card. The scenes that are meant to be intense, like the scene when Vincent's first victim comes falling out of the window and onto Max's cab, become vague and dull with Foxx's overacting and the loose dialogue.<br /><br />Collateral could have been a very good movie if only the director and casting crew would have decided to hire different lead actors.<br /><br />C-</p></body></html>

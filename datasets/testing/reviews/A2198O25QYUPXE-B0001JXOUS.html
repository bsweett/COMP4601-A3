<meta name="summary" content="Self-discovery in the midst of a country redefining itself"></head><body><p>Nathan Algren (played by Tom Cruise) is a troubled alcoholic who is fast approaching self-destruction, following the North American Indian Wars.<br /><br />Down and nearly out, Algren is approached by members of his former cavalry unit to help train the emerging Japanese military.<br /><br />At first Algren is driven by the opportunity to make a quick and substantial dollar in Japan, yet it is when he is left for dead that he begins the process of healing himself, whilst held in captivity.<br /><br />The film provides a sample of a Japan that has newly opened itself to the Western World, with tradition and new ways having an uneasy relationship.<br /><br />It is possibly one of Cruise's best performances of the 2000's, and the movie narrative is rich with action and meaningful story.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

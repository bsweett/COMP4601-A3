<meta name="summary" content="Tarentino's First &amp; Perhaps Foremost..."></head><body><p>Quentin Tarantino's first movie is so good that it should be almost impossible to make a better (or to some, on par) movie after it. Of course we know he did that with `Pulp Fiction' but here Tarantino already shows us how great he is. `Reservoir Dogs' is a violent movie with some scenes, one in particular, that could be too much for you. If you can stand the violence you should not miss this one.<p>Six gangsters, who know each other only by there codename, have to steal some diamonds. They are set up and the police is expecting them. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) escapes with Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) who is shot already. They arrive in the warehouse where they were supposed to go. Not much later Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) and Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) arrive as well. Who is the traitor? Is it one of them, or may be the missing Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) or Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), the boss Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) or his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn)?<p>The direction from Tarantino is extremely sharp, Michael Madsen is pure evil and Buscemi, Keitel and especially Roth give fine performances as well. Another great thing is the soundtrack from The George Baker Selection with Little Green Bag to Harry Nilsson with Coconut. A great first movie from a great director. And ask yourself this, do you tip?</p></body></html>

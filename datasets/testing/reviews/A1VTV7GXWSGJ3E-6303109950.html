<meta name="summary" content="Good story telling and a decent western"></head><body><p>I hesitated to see this movie for two big reasons: Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. VAL KILMER?  However, since I do so love westerns my curiosity got the better of me. I'm glad I did. Both  actors brought the characters to life, both their good and bad sides.  Kilmer did something I never though he could do: Make me forget who was  playing the part. His protrayal of Holliday is well done and  mesmorizing.<p>Tombstone starts as Wyatt Earp is arriving in town and  immediately starts to build on the feud that develops between the Earps and  the &quot;Cowboys&quot; (the Clantons, Johnny Ringo, etc). Although the  story is engrossing, and action driven, it also is a little light on  historical fact. As with most &quot;OK Corral&quot; films, the film weighs  heavily on the Earps as the good guys and the Clantons as the bad. In  reality, the situation was nothing more than a power struggle between two  groups for control of Tombstone. Also, while there is some sexual tenson  between Wyatt and Josephine, the film portrays the relationship as benign  until the end, in reality the relationship took off, by most historical  accounts, well before Wyatt's wife leaves and eventually dies of a drug  overdose. But also certain scenes are very well grounded in history. The  gunfight at the OK Corral in this movie is well scripted to what is  considered the true version. Short and violent. Also Wyatt's reign of  terror after his brothers are shot, and he starts to take his revenge is  close to the actual events, although still to heavy on him as &quot;the  good guy&quot;.<p>As Westerns go though, Tombstone is fun and a watchable  romp. As OK Corrall films go, probably Burt Lancaster's &quot;Gunfight at  the OK Corral&quot; is better (although even less historical), &quot;Hour  of the Gun&quot; with James Garner is grittier and darker (probably the  closest to Wyatt's true temperment), and &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;  with Henry Fonda probably the best of all. Don't hesitate to watch and  enjoy this film. If you like westerns you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

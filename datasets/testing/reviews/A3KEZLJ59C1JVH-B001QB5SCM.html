<meta name="summary" content="An emotional tale of two sisters"></head><body><p>The movie "In Her Shoes" is based on Jennifer Weiner's novel with the same name. I read the book several months ago and really enjoyed it, but I never had any desire to see the film because I couldn't picture Cameron Diaz as Maggie. That was a big mistake on my part. Diaz gets a bad rap because she's starred in a lot of crappy movies ("Charlie's Angels," anyone?) and is dating a former Backstreet Boy. However, when presented with a good script, Diaz proves that she can actually act. She was amazing in "Being John Malkovich" and delivers an outstanding performance in "In Her Shoes."<br /><br />This movie is about two sisters, Maggie Feller and her sister Rose (Toni Collette). Rose is a successful attorney and is the stereotypical boring, responsible older sister. Younger sister Maggie spends her days and nights drinking and partying, sleeping with whatever random guys happen to be around, and never being able to hold a job for more than a couple of weeks. Being the kind sister that she is, Rose allows Maggie to crash on her couch for what seems to be the millionth time. The two women argue about their respective life choices, and eventually have a big fight. Rose demands that Maggie vacate the apartment, and Maggie retaliates by seducing Rose's coworker/lover, Jim (Richard Burgi). Rose catches Maggie and Jim and the act, and Maggie suddenly finds herself with nowhere to go. Her only option is to track down a mysterious grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) who has been out of the picture since the Feller girls were very young. Maggie travels down to Florida and learns some important lessons from her grandmother Ella, who lives in a senior retirement community. Meanwhile, Rose goes through some personal transformations of her own back home. In spite of everything that has happened between them, Rose and Maggie are unable to sever the bond that has always tied them together, and with the help of their grandmother, the girls are finally able to appreciate each other and enjoy a satisfying reconciliation.<br /><br />I really, REALLY enjoyed this movie. I was impressed at how true the film was to Weiner's novel. There are several things in the film that differ from the book, most notably the fact that Maggie's entire experience hiding out at the university is omitted from the movie. That was a real disappointment at first because I always thought that aspect of the story was one of the most interesting parts of the book. However, Weiner's novel is pretty long and not everything could make it to the big screen. Some material had to be cut for the screenplay and it made sense to cut out the university. Besides, the screenplay incorporates several themes from the university section of the book by creating a relationship between Maggie and a retired Italian professor who lives at the retirement center, which was incredibly moving and well done.<br /><br />The entire cast of "In Her Shoes" is phenomenal. Diaz and MacLaine steal the show, but the supporting cast is spectacular. I especially Mark Feuerstein's performance as Simon. (By the way, the character of Simon is much more attractive and overall appealing in the film than he is in the book!) The one performance that didn't thrill me was Collette's. For some reason, I just couldn't warm up to the character of Rose at all. I thought that Collette's portrayal of the character was way too edgy, resulting in Rose coming across as extremely unlikable. When I read the novel, I was instantly sympathetic toward Rose and hated Maggie...then Maggie underwent her slow character transformation and I eventually warmed up to her as well. While watching the movie, I was able to sympathize with Maggie's character almost right off the bat, even though she was such a brat. I never really felt sympathetic toward Rose, even though all these terrible things were happening to her. Collette's interpretation of the role was too stuffy and cold, which was extremely unfortunate. I wish someone else had been cast in the part.<br /><br />In spite of Collette ruining the character of Rose for me, I still think that "In Her Shoes" is a great adaptation of Weiner's excellent novel. Fans of the book will love the film, and anyone looking for an emotional "girly" movie will love it as well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WACKY HUMOR MEETS THE 80s"></head><body><p>Goofy and wacky humor intermixed with with sex jokes, barfing jokes and even barfing on squirrel jokes.  One of the funnier scenes was the BJ scene based on a lost bet but I don't want to spoil it.  The first 15-20 minutes are slow and things don't really take off until they head back into time and we are slammed with 80s jokes after 80s jokes.  The overall story tends to lag and then rise several times but about a third to half of the jokes makes this worth watching if you like this type of humor.  I'm talking to you Saul Morales.  Heh.  Small cameo by Chevy Chase.  Fans of the 80s or those who lived through it will better appreciate this movie. MY GRADE: B minus to B plus (depending on your humor tastes and knowledge of the 80s).</p></body></html>

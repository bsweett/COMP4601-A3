But as the following days, Metropolis does have it's daily dangers as Superman does his job and also has to stop Luthor from his evil plan.<br /><br />This movie was a big budget production that was in development since late 1976 when producer Alexander Salkind bought the movie rights for it with Warner Brothers ( who owns DC comics) and hired the director of "The Omen" Richard Donner to bring to life the beloved superhero icon of all time. People were amazed by the teaser back in late 1977 then the movie came out in december of 1978 to become one of the highest grossing movies of the year with rave reviews and a classic for all comic book fans everywhere, Christopher Reeves with the other cast are superb in it even with the three Kryptonian crooks ( Terrence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran) who get imprisoned and become the villains for the second movie, Ned Betty as Otis and Jackie Cooper as the boss of the daily Planet Perry White. The special effects for it's time were remarkable and not only those but great acting, perfect direction, a superb music score by John Williams and heart to it makes it's the ultimate superhero movie and really set the standard for them for years to come.<br /><br />The DVD is terrific with quality remastered sound and picture, the movie itself is the extended restored cut which makes the movie even better. There's also a music-only track to hear the isolated score, audio commentary by the creative consultant team and Richard Donner, cast and crew bios, the added scenes that were restored on this DVD, awards, trailer & teaser, TV Spot, screen tests, additional music cues, two deleted scenes and featurettes.<br /><br />A must have for anyone who wants to own the esstenial superhero flick next to "Batman Begins".</p></body></html>

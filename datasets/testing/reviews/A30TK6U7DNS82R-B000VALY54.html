He's whisked away to the phony world of LA, where every girl named "Jill" spells it "Jylle."  At a fabulous cocktail party he meets Harlan Dexter, once a B-movie actor and now a very rich enterpreneur whose daughter has only recently returned from a long sojourn to Paris.  Harry also meets his high school sweetheart, a girl who never gave him a toss back then, but now she's seeing him with new eyes.  The two of them share an appreciation for the pulp novels of the 1950s and 1960s featuring a Mike Hammer type PI called "Jonny Gossamer."<br /><br />KISS KISS BANG BANG is a lot of fun.  Walking into the theater you don't expect such a rambunctious, talky, endlessly yakking movie.  You have to be on your toes, narratologically speaking, the entire time, and don't try leaing your seat to use the restroom, you'll have missed probably the entire point of the movie.  Does even Shane Black know the story he's written, and why the three women who meet their maker got so confused that neither the police, the detectives, nor the gang that killed them seem to be able to piece them apart, like the old shell game.<br /><br />The movie is stunning to look at besides.  The credits are impeccable; we've seen numerous movie credits designed to resemble the old time look of the Bond films, but this one, in rusty shades of orange and black, is stylish and exciting.  In general the designers of the movie deserve awards.  The use of the hotel Standard is brilliant<br /><br />Downey Jr and Kilmer are both pretty entertaining, but the excitement here is the performance of Michelle Monaghan as Harmony Faith Lane (a name that, oddly enough, strings together  the names of two of Buffy's betes noires).<br /><br />As Harmony Miss Monaghan, a Denise Richards lookalike, shows a talent that can stand right up next to the fast talking dames of the thirties like Rosalind Russell or Carole Lombard, and plus she has a genuine American beauty tht makes it believable she could come from somewhere central, like Indiana.  You root for her to succeed, even when she shows the more disagreeable sides to her personality.<br /><br />I can imagine some people disliking the movie and its constant air of being in love with itself, and yet when the dust is cleared we are always searching for an American cinema with wit and flair, and here it is in this giant, heaping portion, and you would be a fool to turn away such bounty on account of its presumption.  I hope it does well enough to merit numerous sequels, as THE THIN MAN did.  It's on that level if you ask my opinion.<br /><br />PS, what happened to Shannyn Sossamon?  Seems like just yesterday she was Hollywood's it girl, enjoying leading lady parts in such films as A KNIGHT'S TALE or THE RULES OF ATTRACTION.  Here she plays, get this, "Pink Hair Girl"?  Are they trying to punish her for being beautiful and talented, or what?</p></body></html>

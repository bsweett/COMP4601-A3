<meta name="summary" content="A French Intense Psycho Slasher Film..."></head><body><p>High Tension is a French intense psycho slasher film that will grab the audience's intestines with a twisting grip that will not let go until the final scene.  The director Alexandre Aja continues where Psycho (1960), Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), House of 1000 Corpses (2003), and Wrong Turn (2003) end.  Similar to the other slasher films High Tension has a female hero that the audience gets to follow, as she witnesses a series of harrowing murders.  Aja generates an idea that seems to be a metamorphosis between Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and House of 1000 Corpses, yet it has it's own touch as the film's hero Marie (C&eacute;cile De France) follows the killer in order to try to rescue her kidnapped friend.<br /><br />The story opens with Marie and Alex (Ma?wenn Le Besco) who are on their way to visit Alex's parents who live on a remote farm somewhere in France.  During the trip the audience is introduced to the two young and attractive women through their discussions in regards to men and other things that interest them.  They arrive at Alex's home late in the evening when everyone except the father is asleep.  Alex shows Marie to her room, and they decide to go to sleep shortly thereafter.  However, Marie stays up a little longer listening to her walkman while masturbating, unaware of the the danger that is arriving to the remote house.<br /><br />The audience has already been introduced to the psycho-killer before he stops his dirty and bloodstained van outside the house.  The first introduction the audience receives of the killer will cause him to remain in the minds of the audience for a long time, as it deeply shocks any viewer when he requests his first victim to look him in the eyes.  The killer is performed by Philippe Nahon who some might recognize from Gaspar No&eacute;'s distressing I Stand Alone (1998) where he is the disturbed butcher with abnormal and perverse logic.  The truck that the killer is driving seems to be a French version of the Jeepers Creepers van, which serves as tool for his disturbing games that he plays with his victims.<br /><br />Marie notices the family dog barking, which also wakes up Alex's father.  Marie listens from her room while looking out through the upstairs window, as she sees the killer strike a metal object through an opening in the door.  This is followed by Marie attempting to come up with an idea of how to stay alive while the killer begins to visit each member of the house.  Through the walls and the floor Marie hears how the rest of the family is being attacked by the psychopath while panic intensifies within her.  Marie finds a way to hide, and she also discovers that her friend is alive.  It turns into a hide-and -seek game, as the killer is still unaware of Marie's existence while he chains Alex inside his van.  A long and bloody journey continues while Marie attempts to free her friend from a painful and tormenting death.<br /><br />Aja's horror film brings the audience into a realm of the truly disturbing and shocking, which cannot possibly entertain.  However, the film will ultimately provide a chilling venture that crawls under the skin and leaves small imaginary eggs that wait to hatch when darkness falls.  These imaginary eggs will help remind the audience of the horrors and terrors that imagination can concoct.  The cinematography is actually very good, as it uses filters and camera movements that help generate further fear and paranoia.  When the audience leaves the theater the audience will look around wherever they go because who knows what is behind the next corner.</p></body></html>

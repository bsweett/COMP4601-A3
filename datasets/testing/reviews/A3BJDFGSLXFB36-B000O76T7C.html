<meta name="summary" content="A timeless icon"></head><body><p>Alien is a timeless movie. Although released in 1979, even today the movie does not appear dated. This film set the bar for all future horror and sci-fi films to come. So far, no other film has even come close (James Cameron did, however, create the PERFECT sequel 6 years later).<br /><br />Do not miss this film. If you are a movie-lover (you don't necessarily have to be a sci-fi or horror fan to enjoy this film) or if you collect DVDs, this film is a "must-have". It was an instant classic back in 1979 and still is today. By the way, the original tagline was "In space, no one can hear you scream". That tagline, albeit in many different forms, is still tossed around and used today.<br /><br />Do not miss this film!</p></body></html>

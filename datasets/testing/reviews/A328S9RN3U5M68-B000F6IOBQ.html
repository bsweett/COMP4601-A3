<meta name="summary" content="Viktor's Wings as the Star of the Show"></head><body><p>Some movies are created for special effects carnivals: a subservient storyline serves merely as the glue to hold together 106 minutes of action. Films such as UNDERWORLD - EVOLUTION is one of this genre and if the viewers take it for that they won't be disappointed.  Writer (with Danny McBride) and Director Len Wiseman pulled out all the unused parts of the original UNDERWORLD and have recycled them and magnified them into a sequel starring Wiseman's wife Kate Beckinsale and he knows how to make it work.<br /><br />The script for the film is probably only a few pages long so the bulk of the piece is action. And here the real stars appear: Production Design by Patrick Tatopoulos, Art Direction by Chris August, Set Decoration by Lin MacDonald and Costume Design by<br /><br />Wendy Partridge are only a few of the names that deserve the credit for the success.  Everything is shot in a shade of blue (Simon Duggan is the cinematographer) but of course that is appropriate because it all takes place at night when vampires can function.  The story is rather easy to condense: lycans vs vampires with a cross section of a hybrid to spice things up come into a centuries old conflict struggle for power.  More than that is unnecessary to know.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale is ever beautiful and is such a fine actress that she brings some warmth to this comic book heroine.  But the rest of the cast is paralyzed by silly dialogue and that holds down the likes of Derek Jacobi, Scott Speedman, unintentionally hilarious bad guy Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen, etc.  But keep your eyes focused on the locks, the wonderful wings of Viktor  with all that they can do, and the entertainingly gruesome and ultimately tiring 'turning' of men into distortions of werewolves.  As for Beckinsale and Speedman, they make a nice couple, but it is more a 'blood in, blood out' romance.<br /><br />Not for the squeamish or those who look for story, but for what it is UNDERWORLD part II and obviously to be continued is a special effects delight.

<meta name="summary" content="absolutely horrible nightmare of addiction and downward spirals"></head><body><p>This is one of those art house films that transfixes you on first viewing but that you never want to see again.  It is utterly horrifying to see these 4 people ruin their lives, each with their own drug nightmare.  But what is remarkable is the mood - the consistent feeling of losing control, of fear, of dying hope - that permeates every part of it.  The only kind of film to which I would compare it is a horror film, seen by a child:  you feel trapped within someone else's fantasy, unable to extricate yourself until it ends, but this is for adults with adult issues.  Yes, they are all losers in one way or another, yet you feel sympathy for them mixed with revulsion.<br /><br />It is a great movie, but I would recommend renting it to see, you won't want to watch it again.</p></body></html>

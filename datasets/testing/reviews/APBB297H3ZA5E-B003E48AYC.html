Although I tend to like most Johnny Depp films (esp Charlie Chocolate Factory etc...) and this film was visually amazing, in the end a good film is based on solid writing and solid acting... which this film sorely lacked in.  Bottomline, the movie seemed that it had everything going for it (special effects, the classic story, famous actors)... but it was just plain boring, I'm mean really boring.  Out of the three family members who started to watch this film, no one finished it.  Even my kid who waches almost anything, was so completely bored with this film that he just went on to do other mundane things.  Bottomline, if you value your time, skip this dud.</p></body></html>

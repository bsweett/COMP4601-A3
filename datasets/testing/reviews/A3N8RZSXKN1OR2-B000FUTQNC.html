When he's not working, he lives with his wife Beth (Virginia Madsen), an architect who designed their home and works from it, and his two kids, Sarah (Carly Schroder), 14, and Andy (Jimmy Bennett), eight.  The first hint he has of trouble is when he discovers that someone has compromised his identity and racked up $93,000 worth of online gambling debts in his name.  But if he thought things couldn't get worse, he soon finds out how wrong he can be, as a smooth-talking crook (Paul Bettany) seizes his home and family to force him to hack into the security system he designed and steal $200,000,000.  The problem is that a recent merger has left him unable to do it in the way his enemy has in mind.  Can he find a way to get his family free, or will he have to improvise--and then rescue his loved ones on his own after all?<br /><br />Ford may be getting older, but he's not slowing down; not only does he do a great turn here as a man in terror for his family and desperately searching for a way to save them *and* thwart the bad guys, but in a climactic fight scene with the boss robber he shows he can still get physical.  Bettany is a truly horrible villain--clearly both brilliant and a psycho, quite willing to kill his own men if they displease him or to threaten or even torture a child--which makes Ford's ordinary-guy heroics all the more believable and affecting.  It may bear a resemblance to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305222878">Patriot Games</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305127719">Clear and Present Danger</a>, but it can stand on its own merits, thanks largely to the involved computer angle; and since Ford isn't expected to be an action hero for most of its length, he can better showcase his acting talents while still making his character both plausible and sympathetic.  An excellent action thriller, though not for young kids.</p></body></html>

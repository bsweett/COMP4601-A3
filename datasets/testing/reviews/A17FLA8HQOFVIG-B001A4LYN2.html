<meta name="summary" content="Oil wells.  Family.  Religion.  Power.  Greed.  Violence.  A truly fine film.!"></head><body><p>Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar in 2008 for his performance in this film. I can well understand why. Cast as an unscrupulous oil tycoon in the early part of the 20th century, he paints the portrait of true greed and ruthlessness.  He has no relationships, no family and no regrets as he cheats people out of their land in order to build oil wells.  There is no dialogue for the first 15 minutes of the film.  We see him prospecting for gold in a makeshift and dangerous shaft.  He's alone, and when he has a fall that breaks his leg, he pulls himself out of the shaft in grit and determination.  His characterization is set then.<br /><br />Later we see him working on a mine with a small baby in a basket.  He tells everyone this is his son and that his wife has died in childbirth, but throughout the film we never meet any woman in his life and there is no back story at all about the child.  He calls the child his son and is grooming him to be an oilman and there are some very poignant scenes between these two.  And then, an accident happens and his son becomes deaf.  The father does what he thinks is right, but leaves the son hating him forever.<br /><br />Into this mix comes a young evangelical preacher, played by Paul Dano, whose family sold oil to the oilman.  This young man is a religious zealot and wants say a prayer to dedicate the first oil well that is dug on the land.  But the oilman disrespects him and embarrasses him instead and this leads to a lifelong hatred and competition between them both, resulting in a rather confusing and violent conclusion to the film.<br /><br />The acting was superb. The theme was fascinating, and it moved so fast that its length of 158 minutes didn't bother me at all.  It is not for everybody though because it is very violent and the theme and plot are not tied up neatly.  Frankly, though I loved it.</p></body></html>

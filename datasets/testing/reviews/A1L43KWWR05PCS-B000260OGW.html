While it is not a bad film, the only thing that makes this film worthwhile are the thespian efforts of Robert Duvall and Michael Gambon. Somehow, they manage to pull it all together for Costner with superlative performances. Kudos to Annette Benning for opting for reality and foregoing the makeup and trappings of Hollywood that would be misplaced in this western that is set in late nineteenth century America.<p>This is a film about free grazers who drove their cattle over the open range in defiance of territorial ranchers who resented this use of their land. When free grazers, Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charley (Kevin Costner), take to the open prairies, they cross the open range of wealthy rancher Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon), a hard fisted, no nonsense Irishman, who is determined to keep free grazers off his land. Obviously, this results in a showdown. As to who wins, take a wild guess. <p>Annette Benning plays the role of  Sue Barlow, the local doctor's sister who helps patch up the wounded and provides romantic interest for Costner. Unfortunately, there is little chemistry between the two, and the only thing heating up the screen is the ever present gunfire. Still, notwithstanding the fact that this film is nothing to write home about unless you are a true aficionado of this genre, it is still worth a rental, if only to glimpse Robert Duvall and Michael Gambon at work.</p></body></html>

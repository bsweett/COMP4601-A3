<meta name="summary" content="Electrifying cold war drama!"></head><body><p>This is a sensational movie, brilliantly directed and acted.  I was not impressed with the Richard Condon novel, and I found it hard to follow.  By contrast, the film moves at a breakneck pace with an exceptionally coherent plot and an electrifying premise and ending.<br /><br />Angela Landsbury is apparently timeless.  She looks the same in this film as she did 20 years later.  Here, she presents her best performance ever as Raymond Shaw's (Lawrence Harvey, putting in a superb performance) evil, scheming mother.  Frank Sinatra is fine in his accustomed tough-guy role.  My favorite actor in this film is Khigh Dhiegh as the sinister, sardonic Yen Lo ("...if kill he must for a better New York, he must do it with humor!...")<br /><br />This film is quite possibly the best and most powerful film ever made about the Cold War.  The basic premise, that an enemy country could manipulate the American political process to gain control of the government, is intriguing and chilling.  Despite the near-demise of Communism, this film has lost none of its impact, and has as much punch today as it did back when it first came out, during the bad old days of the Cold War.<br /><br />The single most striking aspect of this film is the direction.  The manner in which the American soldiers captured by the North Koreans are shown being psychologically conditioned by the diabolical Yen Lo (in the supposed train station in New Jersey) is incredibly well done.  By the way, the film is done in black-and-white, and this is one of those films that benefits from this medium.<br /><br />This film and DVD deserves every one of its five stars.  This is a terrific film and story, with excellent acting and stellar direction.  A must-have.</p></body></html>

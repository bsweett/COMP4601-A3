<meta name="summary" content="Taut, effective zombie kill fest."></head><body><p>This was a taut, chilling, and surprisingly effective zombie kill fest.  The opening with the lethal lock-down of the complex by the super-computer is at once coldly methodical, and deadly.  Milla as the heroine has transformed markedly since her Fifth Element days, and does an admirable job as the anesthesia victim.  This film really moves along at a great pace, the Marylyn Manson soundtrack kicks it up a notch along w/ the action sequences.  A deadly virus is released in an underground research complex, the host computer kills all the scientists rather than risk external exposure of the virus.  A security detail is dispatched to ascertain what went wrong, but are themselves targeted by the newly animated dead.  One of the better of its breed to be sure, very polished and gritty at the same time.  It works, recommended.</p></body></html>

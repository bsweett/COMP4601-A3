<meta name="summary" content="Heroes"></head><body><p>Paul Greengrass has made some terrific movies: "The Bourne Supremacy" for one and the documentary "Bloody Sunday" for another. In his re-telling of the chilling and poignant story of the passengers on that fateful flight "United 93," he once again has produced a detailed, obviously carefully researched story that shows us probably more than we actually want to see: for so much of it is painfully personal and tragic.<br />One interesting choice that Greengrass makes is to stay away, almost completely, from naming anyone on board the airplane. He chooses instead to treat those that successfully overrun the terrorists as a whole: a democratic them against us mentality that robs us from completely investing emotionally in any one in particular. It's a bold move but also one that distances rather than brings us closer.<br />"United 93" begins very matter-of factly: the four terrorists going about their ritual cleansing and prayer in preparation of their horrible deed, at the airport people standing in line waiting to check in, the ground crew preparing the plane, the pilots and attendants kibitzing: very calm, very ordinary...only the terrorists know what is to occur. But more to the point, the ordinary passengers on flight 93 returning home, on a business trip, on vacation who think they are boarding a routine flight, have no idea what they will be forced to endure and to what they will be asked to react. Therein lays the drama of this film: people like you and I transformed, out of necessity and circumstances beyond our control, into heroes.<br />Greengrass films this story as close to real time as possible. The drama unfolds as it happens and the film's genius is that none of this feels manipulated: when the owlish, round-faced passenger says "no one is going to help us...we must do this ourselves" the action unravels naturally...without pretense without manufactured "drama."<br />"United 93" is on many levels horrifying, upsetting and depressing. Yet out of all of this, because it is so well made and acted, let's hope that the survivors of those killed will get at least a small measure of closure if not the release of a full blown catharsis.</p></body></html>

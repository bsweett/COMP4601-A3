<meta name="summary" content="Besson's Bad Boy Comes Good Again - Pass the Popcorn"></head><body><p>Jason Statham returns to the role of Frank Martin, a professional "driver" with exceptional fighting skills, only this time he is on a routine baby sitting job for the Son of Senator Billings (Matthew Modine). In time honored fashion there is an attempt to kidnap the boy, but this is just the tip of a hair brained plot by arch villian Gianni, working freelance for Columbian drug lords. A toxic virus, drugs, money, murder and pretty much any other nefarious activity are at the top of his agenda, and the only man standing in his way is (you guessed it) Frank Martin. As usual the police, FBI et al are on the case, and totally useless, and Frank must use all his skills to save the day. That's about it really - this is NOT a movie that will test your intellect, or I suspect top any drama awards lists, but if you accept that going in, you'll have fun. The action is thick and fast, and some of the stuntwork and fight choreography under the watchful eye of the talented Cory Yuen (director of the first Transporter movie)is amazing. There is some comic relief along the way from Francois Berleand as Tarconi (the French Police chief from the last movie also) supposedly visiting Frank in Miami on vacation, and a few other familiar faces pop up in this Euro muscle flexing exercise. A lot of people have been damning of the lack of character development, often wooden supporting performances, and ridiculous aspects of some action sequences, but I would ask them "What did you expect?" - Statham carries the role very well, with a brooding but calm confidence, and arguably gives away some of the limelight to his Audi A8 W12 car, which steals many scenes in some amazing car chases. Pure escapism at it's best, Director Louis Letterier delivers Bessons script in a punchy unpretentious way and the end result certainly leaves this movie head and shoulders above similar releases, like XXX State of the Union for example. Wonderful Miami backdrops finish off the eye candy, and a psychotic, sexy she villian is also thrown in for good measure. Go on, indulge yourself and pass the popcorn. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

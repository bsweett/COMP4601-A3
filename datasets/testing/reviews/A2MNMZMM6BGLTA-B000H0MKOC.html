<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie! Hilarious!!!"></head><body><p>Just got done watching Thank You For Smoking. This movie was simply hilarious from beginning to end. I love the dark and very smart humor. It was well written, had a fantastic cast and the acting was superior. Now as I am writing this and thinking that this movie was just great and flawless... I remember one glaring FLAW. Katey Holmes was completely and totally miscast. I can only imagine that she got the role because of her recent publicity filled relationship with the grinny idiot Tom Cruise and their sham relationship. The character is described by somebody in the cast before you even meet her as this bombshell babe of a reporter with great chest that would melt and had melted many a man into spilling his guts. So who do we get? Who is this brick you know what house that can seduce any man? Why it is 14 year old looking and acting Katey 'Kate' (to her grinning ingnoramous of a sudo husband) Holmes. I don't think much of her in any role unless it is of a 14 year old and certainly she was totally miscast in this movie that has cast every other character dead on. I cannot, for the life of me, imagine them filling this cast with Aaron Ekhart, Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot, Maria Bello or anybody else in this top notch cast and then saying, "you know who we should get for the bombshell sexpot reporter?!!! Why let's get KATEY HOLMES!!!" And somebody saying, "I have to have her! She is our first and only choice!" Give me a break.<br /><br />The best thing is that even this total miscasting did not hurt this movie. It is 5 stars and Oscar worthy.</p></body></html>

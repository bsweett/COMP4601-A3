<meta name="summary" content="Oliver Stone tells the story of Alexander the So-What"></head><body><p>I thought Oliver Stone's "Alexander" went off the tracks when we suddenly cut from Alexander (Collin Farrell) as a young man butting heads with his father, King Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer), to Alexander as King about to fight the army of the Persian ruler Darius at the Battle of Issus.  I thought this was because since Alexander has the known world to conquerer in the 2 hours and 55 minutes of the director's cut that Stone was simply moving on to the good stuff.  But instead of simply doing a cinematic tour of the highlights of the life of Alexander the Great, Stone develops parallel stories.  In the "present" we have Alexander conquering the world while trying to juggle his relationships with Roxanne (Rosario Dawson), the woman he chooses to marry, and his particular friend Hephaistion (Jared Leto), while in the past Alexander has to grow up with a dominating mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie) and a disinterested father.  Actually, his mother insists he is the son of Zeus and not Philip, which explains why the king has picked a new queen and ignores Alexander.<br /><br />Stone's purpose clearly seems to be that he wants to explore "why" Alexander did what he did.  The problem is that the film suggests it has something to do with his relationship with his parents, but how their treatment of him resulted in a young man audacious and brilliant enough to conquer the world is not clear.  The pivotal scene in the film becomes when Alexander insists that he can ride the great horse Bucephalus.  The young Alexander succeeds, just as the older one would conquer the world, but the reason for both remains what it was before the film started.  Alexander succeeds because he is Alexander the Great.  The movie is not advancing our understanding of the man the way that it should.  His parents seem to be teaching him valuable lessons only by negation and if Olympias insists Alexander is not the son of Philip, then Philip is even more blind than he usually is if he does not see that Alexander is not like his mother either.  The success of "Alexander" rests entirely on its ability to explain his motivation, and only in too brief scenes involving Aristotle (Christopher Plummer), does it get close to the start of something that makes sense to me in that regard.<br /><br />"How" Alexander conquered the world is left mostly to the voice over narration of Old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins), now the Egyptian Pharaoh, with the exception of film's two battle sequences, the Battle of Issus and the Battle of the Hydaspes River in India.  These two battles represent his greatest victory and greatest, or at least final, defeat.  From a tactical standpoint the latter is the more interesting battle (especially all of the feints and psychological tactics Alexander employed before hand), but Stone only seeks to explain the former.  However, this is problematic because the battle was being fought on a desert plain devoid of physical detail, which makes it hard to appreciate what is going on the way we have in movies detailing battles like Waterloo or Gettysburg.  Of course, if the emphasis in the film is on "why" then the "how" becomes less important, which is why it is dealt with the way it is in this 2004 film.<br /><br />The production design of the film handles the "where" and "when" of Alexander's life quite well, especially in the depiction of Babylon and some of the gorgeous costumes.  I have no problem with the casting, but I think all of the key principles tend to get too emotional too often, which also works against developing an acceptable "why" to Alexander's life.  We do get a sense of Alexander being ahead of his time in terms of how he treats those he has conquered (anticipation the Roman willingness to bring new peoples into their Empire), but by the time we get to the last acts of the film the quest of "why" he did what he did is complicated by trying to also cover why things fell apart, and we have as sketchy an idea of that in the end as we do the other.  There is a suggestion that Alexander overreached his bounds when he crossed into the Indian subcontinent and the film's most noteworthy cinematic moment creates his literal fall.  But then we are left with the simplistic notion that things fell apart because Alexander died, which means "Alexander" the film has not brought us any further understanding of the man than we had before we sat down to watch it.</p></body></html>

It has quickly become one of my favorite suspense films after a second viewing. I especially got a kick at all of the symbolic visuals and dialogue that are very significant especially in modern society; this is one of the few films of 2007 that really makes us think. It almost acts as a film by Stanley Kubrick, because it's so distinctive and different from many films made in 2007.<br /><br />Some people (teens in particular) may find themselves hating this film because it has a very ponderous pace and an anticlimactic ending. Well, these two things didn't bother me. They fit very well in this movie. The slow flow of the film adds to the suspense between the three major characters: Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Lee Jones), Anton Chigurh (Bardem), and Llewelyn Moss (Brolin). All three never actually meet each other in person, but each play the most significant roles in the film. Chigurh is not your typical antagonist: he knows how to get what he wants. His biggest challenge, however, is recovering a suitcase of two million dollars from animal hunter Moss. Moss decides to keep the money, but many catastrophic things happen as Chigurh ever comes closer to what he desires. Ed Tom Bell is what you call the "bystander," in which he becomes part of the investigation and comments on what has just happened in front of him.<br /><br />I'm not particulary interested in the works by the Coen Brothers, but this, along with Fargo, is the best that I've seen from the two. The acting is perfect (Bardem as Chigurh still scares me after repeated vieweings), the pacing is perfect (sometimes slow is good), and the very minimal use of music is quite effective. The blood and gore is rather heavy in some parts, so you have been warned. It's now one of my top favorite films (alongside The Godfather Saga, Burton's 1989 Batman, every Kubrick flim that's ever made, and so much more).<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></body></html>

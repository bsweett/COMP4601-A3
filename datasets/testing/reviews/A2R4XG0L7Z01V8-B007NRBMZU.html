<meta name="summary" content="Ashton Kutcher - real cutie!"></head><body><p>I've seen Ashton Kutcher before in Dude Where's My Car and Just Married, and he didn't do a thing for me. But add slightly longer, less dorky hair, and a beard, then my eyes literally go out on stalks in my head! Plus, a lovely scene for the ladeez - he appears in little more than a towel at one point, which is very low-slung, and all the females will be yelling at the screen to get him to drop it! That doesn't necessarily mean I like guys with beards - they're OK to look at, it's a totally different matter if you go to kiss them!<p>I've read the novelisation of this, and absolutely loved it. The film is absolutely terrific too, although I missed the first couple of minutes, due to not finding a parking space! All people seem to know Ashton Kutcher for is playing dorky roles/playing dorky roles/ditching Brittany Murphy for Bruce Willis' ex. Wow. What they don't realise is he can pretty much do a serious role, AND he exec-produced it too. Just a little thing to add his CV.<p>If you've read the book, you'll pretty much understand what happens when the film suddenly jumps forward 5 minutes or so. Unfortunately, I went with someone who hadn't read the book, and I kept getting elbows in my ribs every two seconds, asking what the hell was going on! All the 'missing' sections appear later in the movie, but I kinda knew what was happening. It takes a lot to have at least some intelligence.<p>Amy Smart (who I've mainly known from Rat Race) plays the role of Caillie brilliantly. Her image constantly changes throughout the film (think Jenny's sometimes drastic image changes in Forrest Gump). <p>If you're expecting the ending to be very predictable, you'd be wrong. I couldn't really remember what the ending was from the book (need to re-read it now!), and I was quite surprised. It's one of those "what if?" endings, totally not what you're expecting to happen.<p>If you get a chance to see this movie, GO SEE IT! You won't regret it. Or get the DVD. Whatever suits you. I'll be first in line to get the DVD. Already pre-ordered it.</p></body></html>

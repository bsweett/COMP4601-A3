A must-see.<br /><br />That opening paragraph ought to be enough, but in case you need more, I'll try.  Honestly, though, it is a bit tough, because this movie delighted me on a much more personal and visceral level than most.  If you were a fan of the first two films (and I am HUGE fan), then TOY STORY 3 is a near perfect culmination and summation of both the surface stories of these beloved characters and the deeper themes of friendship, responsibility, aging, learning  & growing that the first films were.<br /><br />The toys of TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 are much older now.  Of course, they haven't really changed...they are always toys.  But their owner, Andy, is now just days from leaving for college, and he's packing up his room.  The toys are understandably very concerned:  will they go with Andy to college (highly unlikely), will they be consigned to the attic (not great, but there's always the hope that one day Andy will share his toys with his own children) or will they be consigned to the curbside garbage?  Through a series of misunderstandings, most of the toys end up being donated to a nearby Daycare Center, where they join a motley crew of other donated toys.  (And in the film's most inspired addition, they meet Ken...who is perfectly conceived.  He's a man, but he's meant to be a girl's toy, so his attitude is decidedly "clothing/fashion friendly".)  And all is not as it seems at this daycare center, from evil toys who run the nights like a less-than-benevolent dictatorship to the very young kids whose enjoyment of toys consist of bashing them on the floor.  Our poor friends are subjected to horrific abuse...and it's up to Woody, the original hero, voiced by Tom Hanks, to save them.<br /><br />(You'll notice I'm not spending a lot of time describing the toys.  Honestly, if you don't know them already, don't see TOY STORY 3 until you've enjoyed the other two.  It is absolutely essential that you know these characters already, because the filmmakers sure assume that you do.)<br /><br />The film is packed full of hilarious scenes (the "escape from prison" scene has the best Mr. Potato Head gag possible) and witty conceits (the aforementioned Ken, a dinosaur with a Facebook account, etc.)  As with the prior films, it has delightfully clever "jokes only adults will get" but as opposed to the SHREK movies, for example, it's tone is always one of childlike wonder.  TOY STORY 3 plays to an audience of kids...and yes, it's a total clich&eacute;...it plays to the kid in all of us.  In fact, to get the full emotional resonance of these films, you MUST be an adult.<br /><br />Once all the action and plot is nearly resolved, the film circles back to the issue that's been roiling underneath since the beginning of the film (and possibly even since the beginning of the series)...what happens to the devoted toys when their master outgrows them.  The final 10 minutes or so of the film will devastate you.  In a good way...but nonetheless, be prepared with extra tissue.  You get a good, old-fashioned wallow in tear-jerking...and even though a nitpicker could argue that no college bound student could possibly act in quite the way Andy does, you just embrace it anyway and let the feelings wash over you.<br /><br />It's hard for me to imagine being more satisfied with the conclusion of such a beloved series.  To say "Pixar has done it again" is yet another clich&eacute;.  But it's more true than ever.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Okay but not Fantastic"></head><body><p>This is it, the version of "Fantastic Four" that was made with the boat-loads of money the subject deserved, and that the producers actually intended to see the light of day.  So was it worth the wait?  Not quite.<br /><br />In many respects, "Fantastic Four" patterns itself on the far superior and more successful "Spiderman" - still the standout among superhero movies and especially Marvel Superhero movies.  In this version, the Four are in space doing experiments for the wealthy Viktor Von Doom.  A vain and narrow-minded megalomaniac in the comic, this Doom is a Doom for the 21st century - he's a vain and narrow-minded CEO and (unlike the comic) he's in space with The Four when those crazy cosmic rays attack.  Back on Earth, it doesn't take long for everybody to realize that they've undergone some major life-change.  Hotheaded Johnny Storm becomes "The Human Torch".  The somewhat shy Sue becomes "Invisible Girl" ("girl?!" she asks indignantly when first hearing the name).  Ben Grim morphs into "The Thing" while Reed Richards becomes the oddly-named "Mr. Fantastic".  Of course, nothing in this movie takes long to happen - before you know it, we've got enough dirt on the characters to see where things are going (Reed & Sue's past romance; Ben's rivalry with Johnny) though little in the story explains why the characters act the way they do.  Before you know it, the final battle's been fought, and we get the obligatory sequel-teaser scene.  Following Spiderman's lead, we've got a major act of superheroism on a bridge, the pivotal superhero-naming occurs in a big-time sporting event (motorcross instead of wrestling), and the villain as a CEO who literally kills his rivals.  FF4 is a movie that fills in the grooves, eager to offend no fans while moderately pleasing the largest audience.  It's fun but by the end, you'll probably doubt it was at all fantastic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious Movie, Watch It"></head><body><p>This movie is the funniest movie of the summer, it is absolutly hilarious. It's nice to see a good R-rated comedy again, there aren't to many of them anymore. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are a match made in comedy heaven, they play off of each other so well it hardly seems like acting. This movie is the feel good flick to see. Go see this movie you're not likely to be disappointed.</p></body></html>

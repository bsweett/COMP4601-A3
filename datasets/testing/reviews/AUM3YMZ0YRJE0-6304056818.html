<meta name="summary" content="classic high concept scifi"></head><body><p>This is one of those wonderful works of science fiction:  it both stretches the imagination and reflects the time in which it was made.  The plot revolves around a rescue mission, to a colony that has been silent for 20 years.  Upon arrival, the crew discover a series of mysteries:  while nearly the entire original crew was mysteriously murdered, a single man (Morbius) was miraculously immune, as was his daughter.  The survivors are served by a fantastic robot, Robby, one the original scifi creations that I remember as a child, who is far beyond the science of man to create.  Then there is the hidden menace, which slowly reveals itself as a being that seems to defy the laws of physics.<br /><br />Morbius, of course, is the key to these mysteries, but he is stubborn and convinced of his moral rectitiude as he chooses himself as the guardian of an ancient extraterrestrial culture.  A fateful battle of wills follows with the captain, for whom Morbius' daughter has fallen.  The solution to all the mysteries come together in a wonderfully unforeseen conclusion, which surprises as well as reflects the then-popular Freudian psychanalysis of the time.  It is simply brilliant, both in its themes and its technical execution.  This story will live in my imagination for my entire life.  It is still worth seeing.<br /><br />Warmest recommendation.</p></body></html>

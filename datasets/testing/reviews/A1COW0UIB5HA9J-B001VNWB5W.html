<meta name="summary" content="One of comic cinema's best films now better!"></head><body><p>Somewhere in New York City in an alternate 1985, superheroes have been outlawed and Richard Nixon is still president. A former super soldier named Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) was brutally murdered one night, Comedian's pals from a team called CrimeBusters with heroes like Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who is a Superman-esque immortal god of powers, blank masked avenger Roschach (Jackie Earl Haley), sexy buttkicker Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) and intelligent Batman-esque Nightowl (Patrick Wilson) are together trying to untangle the mystery of who killed Comedian. They are also trying to find out who is behind an uncanny government conspiracy that could cause World War III for they must find the culprit who is behind this.<br /><br />A brilliant and faithful adaptation of the beloved DC Comics graphic novel from Alan Moore and David Gibbons. After many years since 1987 in development hell through many studios like FOX, Universal, Warner, New Line, Paramount to even MGM trying to make the unfilmable graphic novel into a motion picture as many directors from Terry Gilliam to Darren Arfofsky tried, then after the success of the motion picture adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 Zack Snyder was chosen as director since he's a comic fan. He used the graphic novel as storyboards for the film as the film was a shot-to-shot frame-by-frame nearly adaptation that captures Alan Moore's masterpiece well on the big screen. It also uses the comic's brilliant satire on superheros and political issues that brings the audience to an alternate universe not seen since The Matrix. It's a thrilling, complex, intelligent and ultraviolent film that sure isn't like any superhero film you seen and it's definitely not for children, this is a comic movie for adults. This is R-rated stuff here like the graphic novel with language, a couple of sex scenes with some nudity, gory violence and of course complexity, Greg Cannom's make-up effects are terrific including the motion capture technology for Dr. Manhattan. Co-starring Matt Frewer, this is a must see motion picture for anyone who likes Sci-fi, action, complex thrillers or comic book movies but remember to read the graphic novel first.<br /><br />This version is the best of three cuts since it's the longest and interludes the animated "Tales of the Black Freighter" pirate comic story into the film at times for a more unique experience including 2 commentaries and the extras include the amusing short film "Under teh Hood" which shows the origins of the original Nite Owel, 4 documentaries, music video, 11 video journals and a bonus disc which is the graphic novel motion comic.</p></body></html>

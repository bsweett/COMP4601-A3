<meta name="summary" content="And after The Matrix there came..."></head><body><p>Constantine.  A sort of modified Neo character but not nearly as likeable.  This film is a silly "spiritual" kind of film with some incorrect bible facts thrown in.  Reeves gives his usual deadpan performance which worked for him in the Matrix films but certainly does not work here.  His character is a chain smoker who is dying of lung cancer but continues to chain smoke because he's going to hell.  There's a great advertisement for cigarettes!  Actually it gets quite annoying after awhile.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many folks who watch these kind of films get their so called "Sunday school education" from them.  They walk away thinking that they've learned something.  If they'd just read the bible they would see that most of the messages they get from these films are so wrong.<br /><br />This film was so uninteresting that I can't even bring myself to recount the story for you.  It's that boring.  The oddest thing about this movie may be the casting of Reeves himself.  Still riding high from his success with the Matrix trilogy, I guess the casting agents thought that his name would bring in the box office bucks.  He maybe the strangest actor in history.  He's not a great actor, but people keep giving him work.  I like him myself but I'm not sure why yet.  Somebody get my therapist on the phone quick!!!  He's attractive, yes, but his only real claim to fame is that he only has one character in him.  That character is Keanu Reeves.  Nobody plays him better.  He's been called the most boring actor in the world.  Still, people like him.  They like to see him on the screen.  I don't know if this film will boost his career any higher but it just might.  That's the way the cookie crumbles in Hollyweird!  Go figure.<br /><br />Go watch The Matrix.  Nothing special to see here.</p></body></html>

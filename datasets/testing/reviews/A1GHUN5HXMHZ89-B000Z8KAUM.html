<meta name="summary" content="Solid but a Little Less Magic"></head><body><p>Certainly a decent action movie with solid acting with the likes of Pacino and the rest the great cast. I enjoyed it but it didn't have that fun side that the first movie had and not as much pizzaz as the second movie. It was like they sat down and tried to come up with the right ideas, but it didn't quite gel into the umph that made the first movie a hit and the second movie a reasonable expansion. It is still well worth seeing, I just don't plan to add it to my purchases. This is a family movie even though it certainly has an element of crime since items are stolen. However; you never see someone badly injured or killed. I recommend it for a rental. The DVD is great quality and includes standard extras.</p></body></html>

I give this one high marks for excitement, entertainment, and humour.  My favorite thing in the film, is Cary Grant, who is at his most splendid, elegant, funny best.  Just watching this man for two hours is sheer pleasure.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is good.  James Mason gives his usual expert performance as the bad guy who is just charming enough to have won the beautiful blond, for a while.  I usually love Eva Marie Saint but I think that she was not well cast here.  Hitchcok adores his pale blonds but she shines better as a sincere, vulnerable sweetie and doesn't quite pull off the sophisticated double agent role.  I found her attempts at being seductive on the train forced and unattractive. When she shows her true feelings towards the end, she warms up and her real beauty shows.  She looks good, though and there are some great costumes, which apparently Hitchcock picked out for her personally on a shopping trip to Bergdorf's.<br /><br />The woman cast as Grant's mother was only a year older than he was, which seems to be another big mistake.  She is good (reminds me of Stockard Channing) but not at all convincing as his mom.  Also, Grant is just too gorgeous to be going to the theatre with his mother!<br /><br />The most amusing feature of the film, is Mount Rushmore!  Just the idea of having people scrambling for their lives over the faces of our venerable presidents stikes me as very funny--pure Hitchcock.<br /><br />All in all, it's great entertainment.  It's not going to enlighten you or give you great cause to think or stick with you for hours after you see it, but while you're watching it, you'll be glued to the screen.</p></body></html>

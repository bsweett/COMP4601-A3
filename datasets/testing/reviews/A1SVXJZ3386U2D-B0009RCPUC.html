I had watched a couple of cinematic accounts of those final days and I generally came away with the sense that the films were excessive.  Admittedly, it's hard to be excessive about this subject but too many accounts seemed to want to shock rather than inform.  As numbing as "Downfall" is, I was most impressed by how comprehensive its' account seemed to be.  This was largely due, I felt, to the focus on such a wide range of individuals.  Certainly Hitler is the primary focal point but this isn't a movie that's just about him and his thugs.  There are real people trying to do a real job while surrounded by insanity and that aspect really drew me into "Downfall".  I have tried to understand what the collapse of Nazi Germany must have been like.  This movie gave me a sense of that Armageddon<br /><br />This film runs about 2 1/2 hours but I never got the sense that it is a lengthy film.  I was engrossed throughout while simultaneously overwhelmed by a sense of shock at the scope of everything.  Frankly, I was surprized I had not previously heard about "Downfall".  It isn't for every audience but it struck me as being in a class by itself.  Only Germany could produce such an outstanding film on this subject.</p></body></html>

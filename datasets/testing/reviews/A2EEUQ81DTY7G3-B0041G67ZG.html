Well, it may be by political, but it's anything but thrilling. The Interpreter, with all its trumped-up hype, and its pretensions towards being a "serious" movie for adults, is really just a B grade movie that is dressed up trying desperately to be A grade.<br /><br />There's no doubt The Interpreter is a handsome production, and thematically it comes at an important time with a beleaguered United Nations that is desperately trying to remake itself in a post 9/11 world, but the film all too often gets over-involved in self importance, and ultimately sinks under the weight of a rather plodding exposition and tension that is obviously fake and manufactured.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman (ravishing as usual) plays Silvia Broome, an interpreter at the United Nations. However, Silvia more than just an interpreter, for she possesses a steely resolve that discussion and dialogue are the only way to outwit the guns, violence, and corruption that are fast spreading around the globe. She believes fearlessly in the United Nations because it represents exactly the goals and ideals that she's fighting for.<br /><br />A refugee from the African content of Matobo, Ms. Broome seems to be the embodiment of African suffering - both white and black. And although she has a characteristically European education, her roots and her memories are still with the troubled (and fictional) African nation. Her past is fraught with heartache: her white farmer parents were brutally killed by a despotic regime, and her brother, having just been betrayed, is indiscriminately gunned down at the hands of rebel leaders. Silvia has every reason to be angry and bitter.<br /><br />Matobo is currently ruled by Dr. Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), a corrupt Robert Mugabe-like despot who came to power promising to bring wealth and liberation to the people of Matobo, but soon turned into a genocidal maniac. Zuwanie has misspent the hopes of his people with his ambassadors are now forced to play lip service to an increasingly critical United Nations. The UN member states all agree that he should face some kind of justice, as do his two main rivals who are currently exiled in the U.S. - an old-school socialist (Curtiss I' Cook) and a supporter of capitalist development (George Harris). Both have put aside their differences to oppose him more effectively.<br /><br />The Interpreter begins a few days before Dr. Zuwanie's visit to New York to address the General Assembly. Silvia, returning to the office to retrieve her African flutes, overhears someone plotting to kill him when he makes his speech. Frightened and fearful, she is given some protection in the form of two FBI agents Tobin (a terrific Sean Penn) and Dot (a criminally underused Katherine Keener). Tobin is highly suspicious of Silvia's story and thinks she could be fabricating it  - everything just seems too convenient and to be entirely coincidental.<br /><br />As Tobin digs deeper into Silvia's background he begins to suspect that she is more deeply entangled in Matobo's intrigue than she lets on. She's hesitant to come forth with whom she's been talking to and where she's been. Tobin knows Silvia's emotionally if not politically involved in the country's affairs, but just how much she's involved is one of the big revelations of the story. Both Silvia and Tobin are damaged and grieving people. She's still inconsolable from the death of her family, and he is also dealing with personal tragedy. As their respective heartbreaks become clearer to each other, their relationship deepens, not in a sexual way, but as a kind of mutual exercise in learning how to cope.<br /><br />While Nicole and Sean deliver their trademark dramatically strong performances, much of The Interpreter trundles along desperately searching for an identity. Does the film want to be a savvy, tension-filled political thriller? Is it an exercise in the geopolitics and the sociopolitical machinations of the United Nations? Or perhaps it's a plea to end third world corruption and hardship? This viewer was never really sure.<br /><br />There are some fabulous aerial shots of the Manhattan skyline as Zuwanie's motorcade heads towards the UN Building, but the heavy-handed, and overly dramatic music tends to overwhelm the enjoyment of the vista. And it should be said that the organization's headquarters building on First Avenue at 44th Street in Manhattan is beautifully shot, both from without and within. Darius Khondji's cinematography captures the clean, elegant modernism that at once expresses the building's idealistic purpose and places it in a bygone era of internationalist optimism.<br /><br />There are a lot of manufactured, forced, and gratuitous action sequences mostly in the form of people in suits walking around talking frantically on cell phones and walkie-talkies. Many of the plot twists and turns are also pretty evident early on, and there's a bus explosion that is too obviously inserted into the film to give it some dramatic life (although it is the best-filmed sequence in the movie). Unfortunately, The Interpreter is somewhat of a disappointment, because it just doesn't necessarily incite the bonafide suspense, anticipation, or political intrigue that should be a hallmark of films of this type.

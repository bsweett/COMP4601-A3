<meta name="summary" content="Final Conflict lacks drama and tension."></head><body><p>While Damien Thorn, the Anti-Christ itself, now fully grown and a powerful political figure and businessman, is preparing to dominate the world, as it is prophesized somewhere in the bible, the daggers buried under the rubble of the Chicago Museum of Natural History at the climax of Omen 2 are found.  During an excellent opening credit sequence, we follow the daggers of Megiddo from a pawn shop, across the world, and into the hands of a group of Monks who have been patiently waiting for such an opportunity to be given to them.  Everything after that is rather listless, the 'accident' strewn plot enlivened only by a sorely underdeveloped romance of sorts between Damien and a television reporter.  The 'final' conflict itself is really anti-climatic, but Damien does get a great parting shot of a line.<p>The Final Conflict offers a few good things, namely a wonderful debut performance by Sam Neil as Damien and another excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith.  The photography is atmospheric and some of the death scenes are show stoppingly energetic, but that does not a good movie make.  On the negative side we have Damien Thorn, Evil Incarnate and out to Rule the World, then destroy it, who turns out to be far too boring of a one dimensional character to build a film around.  He has no conflict within himself and, outside of that pesky squad of monk assassins, he really has no outside conflict in which to engage him.  The previous movies worked better when focusing on a different character that finds out what Damien is and must then grapple with his/her own human doubt as well as the forces of evil.  Also fans hoping for a huge, global, fate of the world in the balance battle as a climax will be sorely disappointed, it is not to be found.  Worth seeing only for Sam Neil's performance and Goldsmith's score, but not for any kind of attempt at satisfying closure.</p></body></html>

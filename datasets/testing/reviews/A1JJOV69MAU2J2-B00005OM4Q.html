<meta name="summary" content="Heartwarming coming of age tale w/a rock and roll heart"></head><body><p>Cameron Crowe, like any good writer, knows that the best advice for any writer is to &quot;write what you know.&quot; Well, Crowe certainly knows the story of a very young journalist on his first assignment covering a rock band on tour -- because he lived it. <p>This semi-autobiographical take on Rock and Roll, its cynical, destructive and transcendent parts all rolled into one, really sucks you into another time and place the way few movies in recent times have done. The movie feels authentic, in part because the characters are drawn with flaws, with natural story arcs, as opposed to the cardboard cutouts that we have come to expect.<p>William Miller, the boy at the heart of the story, has to balance his boyish desires to be one of the gang with his journalistic intentions to tell the brutal, honest truth.<p>Kate Hudson's character, Penny Lane, injects poignancy into a movie that could have been just another ode to guitar-heads, booze and acid.<p>Frances McDormand, as Miller's mother, also is great as a liberal counterculture mother who contends with her own desires to both protect her son and set him free.<p>The DVD also has a number of interesting extras, including interviews, et al. A special treat are the actual Rolling Stone articles that Cameron Crowe wrote, including his classic story about Led Zeppelin.<p>This is definitely a keeper.</p></body></html>

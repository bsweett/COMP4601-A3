<meta name="summary" content="Harrowing, Heartbreaking, And Heroic--The Best Film Of 2006 Is Also Great Filmmaking"></head><body><p>As we approached the end of 2006, everyone released their pick for the top films of that year. I do the same thing every year as I assess the movies that I've had the pleasure of viewing, either on the big screen or on DVD. 2006, in truth, wasn't the strongest year--but there were a fair share of surprises. While many of the blockbusters actually surpassed my expectations with unusual depth or sheer adrenaline, it is many of the smaller films that lingered in my memory. "United 93" was a moderate hit at the box office and received pretty universal critical acclaim, but there was not much expectation that it would fare well come awards season. It was released very early in the year which is usually problematic. However, to my delight--the film was remembered and honored as one of the year's top films and its reputation has endured and grown stronger.<br /><br />"United 93," for my money, was the best film of 2006. Sparse and powerful, this docudrama took about 90 minutes of real time to unfold one of the most matter-of-factly harrowing and heroic episodes put down on film. Far from being a political diatribe, the film documents a real humanity and the commonality that pulls ordinary people together in a time of crisis. Offering almost no commentary, "United 93" just presents the facts of the situation about that ill-fated flight. Reconstructed largely from actual participants and phone records, this is about as close to reality as a narrative film can get.<br /><br />In an audacious decision, director Paul Greengrass does not ask that we know the passengers or ground crew as individuals. You see them in brief, slice-of-life moments as they ready themselves for the day--but there is no backstory, no manufactured drama. It's just a cross section of regular men and women doing mundane things on what will become a most extraordinary day. You will start to know some of the individuals from their actions and their responses, but the film doesn't offer anything extraneous. This simplicity and lack of ordinary storytelling convention sets "United 93" apart.<br /><br />By allowing an objective viewpoint, the film achieves a power that is more inherently real than 99% of scripted films. There is an honor and dignity at work here that's quite unexpected. Even though the film plays with a documentary feel, it ends up almost impossible not to envision yourself in the same situation. As such, "United 93" strikes a real and resonant emotional chord. It's easy to only accept this film as a poignant document of that day and a tribute to those involved. And that it is. It's also easy for those who wish to dismiss it as a cover-up to conspiracy theories to do so. But what I don't want to get lost in any political debate is the fact that this is also great filmmaking.<br /><br />I was more affected by this film emotionally than any other film of that year. And I have reflected on it more often than any other film in recent years. For those reasons, "United 93" was easily my choice for best film of its year. Heartbreaking, Intelligent, Horrifying, Uplifting--It's perfect. KGHarris, 12/06.</p></body></html>

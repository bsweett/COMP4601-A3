<meta name="summary" content="A different breed of horror"></head><body><p>With so many horror movies lately that seem to assume it's tendency to stack the film to the nose with gore will scare audiences, it's kind of gratifying to finally watch a film that doesn't simply focus on it. Directed by William Friedkin who did possibly the best horror movie ever with the Exorcist as well as doing the French Connection, you're thinking Bug will be the same thing right? Not really. On first viewing, it's interesting if a little slow and hard to emotionally invest in characters and it might not have the same replay value again but it's a disturbing look into paranoia and is at least worth a watch.<br /><br />Agnes is a bar waitress in a small town who's trying to get out of the grip of her controlling, abusive ex Jerry. With her drug habit and a horrible event from her life, Aggie is not as open to meeting new people until her friend/lover R.C. brings home a stranger named Peter. Very unassuming with a quiet demeanor, Peter seems perfect for Aggie and they get together. But Peter has this problem with seeing bugs everywhere and Agnes gets drawn into it as well and the 2 become increasingly paranoid about being infested not only in the room but inside their own bodies.<br /><br />What sets Bug apart from films like Hostel and Saw is the film focuses mainly on the paranoia and delusions that the characters are facing with more violent elements being part of the characters rather than staging entire scenes around it. That said, it's a very slow moving film with characters talking...and talking a lot about bugs and it's more voyeuristic where we see characters become insane rather than understand or relate, we simply just watch. However, the film has somewhat of a cold feeling to it, as if the first viewing was enough so it might be hard to re-watch since we already know what the film was going to be and the tone it has.<br /><br />Inspired by a play, the film is as minimilist as it can get with less than 8 main speaking parts and one scene involving extras so the film doesn't have a narrative so to speak so it's mainly character-driven and luckily we have Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon to watch. Sane though lost, the 2 unravel and they become crazier by the minute when the bugs arrive (although it's funny it's the 5th film in a row I've seen of Judd where she disrobes). Also we have Harry Connick Jr. who plays Jerry who's good as that jerk women hate but he doesn't have much depth to him even though he turns out to be the sanest of the group.<br /><br />When I told a friend I rented the film, she said "that was a...weird movie." My thoughts exactly since at the end of it you were just kind of puzzled by what you saw even though there's nothing confusing. It's crazy, it's completely odd yet it's Bug. Go with it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great trick and treat"></head><body><p>This is one of the best movies to watch. And at Halloween it is particularly appropriate. Any fan of older classic horror movies will find this all the more funny. A great spoof of several horror movies but especially the classic Frankenstein movies.<p>Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Kahn and the rest the cast are great. The sets, sound, music, and lighting do a fantastic job of recreating the brooding black and white images of the original. Mel Brooks does a great job of keeping this three ring circus of comedians on the focus of the movie.Any fans of horror or comedy will like this movie. <p>Mel Brooks fans will defintely love it. The DVD sound and picture is good. The fact that the movie is black and white was done on purpose and actually adds to the illusion of being like the original. The price is a bargain and this is one of Mel Brooks greatest works. His commentary, accessed through language, not extras, is illuminating. The making of documentary is great as well. Don't pass up this classic comedy by some of the best comedians.</p></body></html>

After a series of unfortunate lawsuits, the mighty champion Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has retired to a simple suburban existence with his devoted wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and his super powered children but still longs for his old days of glory. When the mad inventor Syndrome (Jason Lee) seeks revenge on Mr. Incredible and other superheroes, this amazing family unites to save the day. Directed by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant), Pixar's latest CG release is an entertaining mix of rousing comic book adventure and heartfelt family comedy. Its clever storyline is certainly amusing. "The Incredibles" contains some great humor, enormous excitement, stunning CG animation and memorable characters like eccentric fashion designer Edna Mode. The 2004 computer-animated film also features the voice talents of Samuel L. Jackson as super cool hero Frozone.<br /><br />Disney continues to deliver first-rate DVD quality with the release of "The Incredibles" Collector's Edition. Pixar's latest animated smash hit is presented in its original theatrical widescreen format. The DVD has a razor-sharp video transfer with rich detailed colors and flawless sharpness. Its aggressive Dolby Digital 5.1-EX sound is truly excellent. Among special features, this fully-loaded edition includes two audio commentaries with director Brad Bird and production crew, several deleted scenes, an alternate opening, fun outtakes, an informative "Making of The Incredibles" featurette and the amusing "Jack-Jack Attack" animated short. Overall, "The Incredibles" is an exceptional DVD and scores a worthy "A".</p></body></html>

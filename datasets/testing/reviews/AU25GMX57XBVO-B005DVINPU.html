<meta name="summary" content="My Favorite of the Franchise"></head><body><p>I would say that this original Batman movie from 1989 is by far my favorite of the Franchise.  Jack Nicholson is absolutely great in it and without him is hard to say what this original film would be.  Many people consider this to be arguably the greatest work of his career.  Hard to say but most of everything he does in pretty great.  The movie starts out a little slow but then gets fun.  I am not a big fan of comic book type movies like this but have to say Batman is very entertaining.  Sometimes sequels or parts 2,3 can overtake the original but in the Batman series it's hard to beat this original.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

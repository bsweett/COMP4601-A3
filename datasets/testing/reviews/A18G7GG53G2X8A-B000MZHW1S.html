<meta name="summary" content="Diamonds are an Insurgent's Best Friend"></head><body><p>"Blood Diamond" is a film that exposes harsh truths, in effect forcing the audience to get a taste of someone else's unpleasant reality. Specifically, it focuses on the buying and selling of blood diamonds, which are mined in war zones and secretly sold in order to finance an insurgent's war efforts. A majority of the story takes place in Sierra Leone, a small African country that actually directed the world's attention to blood diamonds in the late 1990s. The country was immersed in an intense civil war at that time, fueled by a militant band of rebels called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF for short) and their attempts to overthrow the government. Funding their efforts was an illegal diamond trade, one that forced many innocent people into becoming workers.<br /><br />This movie doesn't attempt to hide the brutality of that civil war; likewise, it doesn't spend long periods of time focusing on bloodshed. What it does is effectively tell a compelling human story that's just as touching as it is ugly. Taking place in 1999, the main character of the story is Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a Sierra Leone native put to work in a diamond mine after the RUF destroys his village and forcefully separates him from his family. While digging up part of the riverbed, he finds a sizeable diamond chunk that has a slight pink tinge to it, something so rare and valuable that its sale could prolong the chaos. Solomon quickly decides to hide the diamond, burying it in a patch of land near the river.<br /><br />When the government's legitimate military force raids the area, Solomon is arrested on suspicion of being part of the RUF. In jail, he crosses paths with Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a slick diamond smuggler with no regard for anyone's well being other than his own. He witnesses a shouting match between Solomon and an RUF soldier nicknamed Captain Poison (David Harwood), one that directly addresses the missing pink diamond. This peaks Archer's interest; he's looking for a way to finally leave Africa, a continent full of hatred, corruption, and despair, more so than even he can stand. He arranges for Solomon to be freed so that they may join forces, find the diamond, and save Solomon's family. Unfortunately, it's a dishonest union; Archer is merely using Solomon as a way to obtain the diamond. He has no feelings whatsoever for a refugee family.<br /><br />At least, he initially doesn't. As the film progresses, some of Archer's layers peel away, gradually revealing a moral compass that isn't as off course as one might think. We come to see him as someone who's been hurt a few too many times, preventing him from pursuing an honest life. American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is trying to reach that side of Archer in order to expose the atrocities occurring within Sierra Leone. In her own way, she's just as manipulative as Archer; she can't write about the corrupt diamond industry unless she has proof, and she can't get any proof without Archer's help. She needs him in order to write a good story. This is somewhat hypocritical when considering her disapproval over Solomon's treatment: "I'm using him, and you're using me," says Archer, "and that is the way it works."<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's truth to that statement, one of the many aforementioned harsh truths that are brought to light. It's refreshing for a film like "Blood Diamond" to present them, especially since it can offer a way to learn about something consumers take for granted. The three characters also have learning experiences, in one form or another. Archer probably has the greatest one; Solomon briefly reunites with his family at the fence of a refugee camp, only to learn that his young son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) has been taken by the RUF. While seeing this does little to diminish Archer's desire to possess the hidden diamond, that one moment of love and anguish still leaves an impression, one that enables a better understanding of Solomon's determination.<br /><br />His desperate feelings are easy to understand from the audience's point of view, and they're completely validated in scenes involving Dia and Captain Poison. They're effectively uncomfortable to watch; the young boy is slowly being brainwashed into believing as the RUF do. Captain Poison immediately takes Dia under his wing in order to make him easier to manipulate. He and other children undergo rigorous training, most of which include the use of firearms. I distinctly remember one moment when Dia is blindfolded and handed a machine gun. He's then obeys the order to pull the trigger. When he removes the blindfold, he realizes that he killed a refugee purposely put in the line of fire.<br /><br />There are many such moments in this film, all of which are unpleasant but nonetheless relevant. The violence and inhumanity is quick, raw, and ugly: many are shot dead; an RUF soldier severs the right hand of a young boy; Captain Poison injects Dia with some kind of drug, presumably heroine. They act as counterpoints to the belief that humans are inherently good at heart; Solomon believes that his son is still the good soul he was before he was captured. "You'll be a doctor someday," he often said to young Dia, who would go to school everyday, even when he didn't quite feel up to it. There's a perfect balance at work here, informing the audience with a mixture of disturbing imagery and enlightening moments of compassion and understanding.<br /><br />As Archer, Solomon, and Maddy continue their journey, this understanding grows deeper. The uncertainty grows, as well: Solomon may never reunite with his family; Archer may never find that precious diamond; Maddy's scoop on Sierra Leone's diamond trade may forever be unprinted; the RUF may continue to rule with an iron fist. How ironic that their motto was: "No More Slaves, No More Masters. Power and Wealth to the People." It makes one wonder whether or not they understood the power of their words, especially since they used them to encourage both acts of violence and undeserved loyalty. "Blood Diamond" does a wonderful job of examining this complex belief system, something that for many years was the reality for the people of Sierra Leone. I'm thankful for having seen this film; it's an eye-opening depiction of a real life crisis, one that a lot people have yet to learn about.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The guy below me is WAY WRONG"></head><body><p>The guy below me says that you see more picture with the Fullscreen format. Right? WRONG. When you go to the movie theaters, all the movies are shown in the widescreen format. OK. When you get widescreen, you see 25% more to the left and right of the screen in the 1.85 widescreen format and 50% more with the 2.35 widescreen format. When you watch a widescreen film, you are not as close to the characters as you are with the fullscreen format. The only reason the black bars are there is because you zoom out everytime the black bars get bigger. The camera moves less in a widescreen film than it does when it's compressed to the fullscreen format. And, they do not cut off the top and bottom portions in the widescreen format.</p></body></html>

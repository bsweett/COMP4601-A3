<meta name="summary" content="Not hungover from this movie"></head><body><p>I waited for this movie for a long time and heard so many positive things; needless to say I was not disappointed but still not completely satisfied as is usually the case with movies that have been incessantly hyped. A word of caution: this movie is only mildly funny and watchable but not the funniest comedy ever.<br />Some crazy characters, witty one -liners and funny dialogues make this a a fun watch. Mike Tyson is hilarious but the real star of the movie is Zack Galifianakis. I liked the movie but it deserved only three stars. 3/22/10</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A RIGHTEOUS WARRIOR"></head><body><p>Denzel Washington is Eli.  He wanders a post-apocalyptic America with the last copy of a book that has the power to revive a society, a culture and a people for good or, if it falls into the wrong hands, for evil.  Eli wanders ever westward on a quest guided by dreams and visions.  It's a mission he does not fully understand but he knows it requires use of deadly force when necessary and Eli is superbly skilled at exercising his swift, lethal skills.  Here's a remarkable film with a strong, stark, visual style.  So much better than the empty, pretentious and similarly set The Road.  Gary Oldman is the despot who seeks the book for power.  Mila Kunis is a na?ve waif who discovers something greater. Fine direction from the Hughes Brothers and Washington is memorable as Eli - a righteous warrior who "walks by faith, not sight."</p></body></html>

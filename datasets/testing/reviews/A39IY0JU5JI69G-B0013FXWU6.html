<meta name="summary" content="Great performance by DDLewis but...."></head><body><p>Daniel Day Lewis is very impressive in this film...and, for the most part, very handsome...even with oil on his face.  So, for my money, it's worth watching....once.  The script is based on a story by Upton Sinclair which was relevant and important at the time Sinclair wrote it.  Now...not so much.  I think the film could have been better if the main character, Daniel Plainview, had been given more to do than cheat and rob people.  True, the interaction with his son is interesting and that saves the film.  Also, the little bit with the blond girl, Mary, was interesting and, at that point, he seemed to be a caring man who was protecting the girl from beatings by her father.<br /><br />What I didn't understand from the film was how deeply he degenerated after he the son returned to him.  It seemed that things were going well for him--he had the family that he had always longed for and certainly the material success.  So why, in the last segment, in his huge mansion, was he so severely embittered?  There was nothing to explain the schism between him and his son. The final scene bordered on the bizarre...did Sinclair write that?<br /><br />While I'm complaining, I'll add that I've about had enough of the character of the charlatan minister.  Perhaps they abounded at the time of Sinclair, but I think this stereotype has been exploited enough.  I've met many wonderful men who were ministers, even of the holy roller type, and I personally find it offensive that they are so often portrayed in this way. This fellow, Eli, was alternately wimpy, cruel, craven and hysterical, not to mention that he was bad looking and had a terrible haircut. I never did understand what happened to Paul. (Only Robert DuVall, in The Apostle, showed the positive side of these men.)<br /><br />Visually the film gives you plenty to look at.  The oil well fire is spectacular.  Even though it's long, it did hold my interest, mostly because of Lewis' performance.  He is such a spectacular looking man and has such a great voice that he engages our sympathy way beyond what was realistic for such a character.<br /><br />I was heartened to read so many negative reviews...am happy to see that not everyone is impressed by the hype this film got.  I give it three stars for the overall spectacle and the Lewis' performance.</p></body></html>

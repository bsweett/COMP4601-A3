<meta name="summary" content="Great to Look at, But Fatally Lacks the Emotional Punch"></head><body><p>I don't say &quot;Troy&quot; is a bad film; it has many virtues, like grand-scale actions and many handsome stars, who, whenever the chances are given, throw away his armors to show his torso. But as far as our emotional reaction go, &quot;Troy&quot; is as empty as that famous horse, or the smile of Helen, who is supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world (who decides that anyway?)<br /><br /> This story of &quot;Iliad&quot; has already been covered (partially) in Robert Wise film &quot;Helen of Troy.&quot; In a nutshell, Paris, Prince of Troy (Orland Bloom) steals the married lady Helen, and his stupid action opens another war between Troy and Greece. Don't say that it's impossible for that's what Homer says.<br /><br /> So we see the siege of the Greek soldiers, who attack the city of Troy, where its leader Hector (Eric Bana) commands. But considerable time of this very long film (2h43m) is given to Achilles (Brad Pitt), who unwillingly obeys the Greek commander Agamemnon (Brain Cox) whose ruthless and villanious character makes a great contrast to other Greek soldiers such as Odysseus (Sean Bean).<br /><br /> The script by David Benioff (novelist of &quot;25th Hour&quot;) remains surprisingly faithful to the original, considering the nature of the original (it's an epic). But if you look close, you notice there are so many elements barrowed from action genre, the last 30 minute in particular, about the famous Trojan Horse episode (which is not included in Homer's poem). The script lacks the emotional punch, or the portal for the audience to enter the inside of the characters -- in short, it's very superficial.<br /><br /> The spectacular fight scenes are all great to watch, I admit, and you need a very close inspection to know what is really going on when the camera sweeps over the army on the coast of Troy. It is realistc, but at the same time very showy.<br /><br /> About the actors. I hate to say this, but Pitt is totally miscast. We need someone who looks more natural when standing with a sword like a warrior. It's true that Pitt pumped up his muscles, but that doesn't mean that he cuts a convincing figure as a deadly soldier like Achilles. He is a demi-god, hardly the fit role for Pitt who is too human (I mean in a good sense, ok?).<br /><br /> Eric Bana shows, perhaps, the better acting as Hector, whose role is not entirely an envious one. But he infuses a considerable amount of humanity to the character, making him a somewhat sympathetic man. After all, Bana is, I think, a better actor than Pitt. As to Bloom, all I can say is that his fans would be greatly disappointed by his slightly negative role (or weakness of personality).<br /><br /> Finally this. Helen. French Diane Kruger is beautiful, but looks very insipid to me. Sorry, but the story requires her to be the beauty that would destroy one nation. However, her Helen does not look such seductiveness (where is Nicole Kidman, please), and the love between her and Paris is so feeble. You know, the director Petersen (&quot;Das Boot&quot; &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;) has never been famous for romance. but we need romance here, which is glaringly missing.</p></body></html>

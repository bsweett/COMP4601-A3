<meta name="summary" content="Excellent acting by Whitaker, but the rest of the movie falls short"></head><body><p>The portrayal of Idi Amin is right on.  His violent outbursts, followed by periods of normalcy, including immense cruelty and apparent irrationality are just what he was, as described in the media at the time.<br /><br />What is puzzling is why a young doctor had to be invented for the movie.  This fellow, just having graduated from medical school, would be intelligent enough, one would think, not to spend his career in a country he picked blindfolded, sticking a pin in a map.  And was Amin's personality so warped that he would have entrusted state decisions, and the welfare of his family, to such a person.  And the Doctor was shown as incredibly naive, in [...] a colleague, in his personal affairs . . it didn't make sense.<br /><br />The Ugandans are not portrayed very well.  They rallied for Amin's predecessor, were overjoyed when he was overthrown by Amin, rallied for Amin, and then were overjoyed again when Amin was gone.  When Amin said to the Doctor . . what do you think . . that we are children that who you can come and play with . . the movie confirms it.  These people are shown to be as children, and the Doctor does seem to be there to play his own ego games with them.<br /><br />Excellent acting by Whitaker, but the rest of the movie falls short.</p></body></html>

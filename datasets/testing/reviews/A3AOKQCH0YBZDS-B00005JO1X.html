<meta name="summary" content="Very Average Movie!!"></head><body><p>I had higher expectations of this movie as I had read the book as a child. Overall I'd recommend watching this movie.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />Computer animation/graphics weren't all the greatest. The filmakers did a great job with the animals, and other mythical creatures, however I think other scenes dealing with natural disasters looked really phony.<br /><br />The acting wasn't the greatest by the four main characters with the acception of the youngest character/sibling, Lucy!!<br /><br />The movie as a whole was too simplistic!!</p></body></html>

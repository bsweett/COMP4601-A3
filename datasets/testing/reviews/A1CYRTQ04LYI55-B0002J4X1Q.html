<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Well Done"></head><body><p>Converting video games into movies is a recipe for disaster.  Especially given how overdone the zombie genre is.  I came in to this movie with suitably low expectations.  In return I got a movie with many interesting twists and turns, some social commentary, subtle ironies and a great ending.  At times it was predictable, but there were enough surprises to keep the movie fresh.  Who could imagine looking forward to part 2 and 3 of a video game based trilogy?</p></body></html>

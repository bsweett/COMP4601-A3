<meta name="summary" content="Cool concepts, characters/effects lacking realism"></head><body><p>First of, I am not a gamer, and am not familiar with the game. This was the first time I watched this Blu-Ray. Equipment used to watch, is Panasonic 42" Plasma, BD30K Blu-Ray player and Onkyo 605.<br /><br />The story was engaging in that it was futuristic, and had some cool effects (although over computerized). I am rating it 3 stars, for the story and overall acting/movie. The PQ and AQ were above average, but not demo, with the picture a bit soft in parts. If you're a fan of the genre, give it a rent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cold War, Chilling Satire"></head><body><p>It is the midst of the Cold War, and America has Russia surrounded by B-52 bombers each equipped with a H-Bomb, just in case. A psychotic, fluid and fluoride obsessed general (Sterling Hayden) one day decides to let them fly, and gives the command to the pilots, which he does without the permission of the President. This sends the US government, deep within their war room, into a panic. Will the President (Peter Sellers), with the help of the creepily grinning Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellers), be able to stop the H Bombs, or will the world be obliterated in a Nuclear holocaust?<br /><br />This is the world of "Dr Strangelove", Stanley Kubrick's 1963 film. This dark satire at the time was a very topical film, and a film I've been meaning to see for some time, being interested in Kubrick and a fan of Peter Sellers. I'm really glad I managed to get a hold of this DVD and see it. It is a very witty, well thought out film.<br /><br />The acting's pretty interesting. The characters of the politicians and generals are often pretty petty, not the kinds of people you'd want handling a dire situation like this, but they aren't exactly parodies, they try to keep their serious face on, you could see politicans and generals acting like this in such a crisis. For a film whose plot involves politics, protocols and special aircraft controls, it's very easy to understand and to follow. It could have been a lot more complicated, but its not, and the satirical parts get to shine through. The aircraft controls, for instance, which are vital plot elements, are clearly marked and given their own shots. Though times have changed since 1963, I wouldn't say the film has dated that much either.<br /><br />On this version of the DVD, there's a nice little selection of special features. Theres a featurette called "The Art of Stanley Kurbrick", which briefly documents Kubrick's early life, his first job as a photographer, and his films up to "Dr Strangelove". There's a meatier, 45 minute documentary called "Inside The Making of Doctor Strangelove" which documents the production and controversies of the film. It was interesting to discover that the set for the B-52 cockpit was so accurate, that Kubrick was confronted by the FBI. There's a few little tidbits like this, and its fascinating. There's also a "split screen" interview with George C. Scott and Peter Sellers, where the screen is split in half, and the actor gives pre recorded answers to scripted questions, which a presenter of the show reads, appearing on the other side of the screen (though in this feature it is blank and there is no one). I have never seen one of these kinds of interviews before, apparently they happened quite often at the time, and it was intriguing to watch. I particularly like the Peter Sellers part of the interview, which he does with his President character's accent, then goes on to discuss and act out accents of the English speaking world, shifting fluidly from one to another. A talented guy. There's also a picture gallery of promotional material (original posters, lobby cards, etc), some talent profiles, selected filmographies of the cast and Kubrick and the very original 1960s trailer with its ever flicking frames and words, which is just as quirky as the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of Kubrick and lovers of satire.</p></body></html>

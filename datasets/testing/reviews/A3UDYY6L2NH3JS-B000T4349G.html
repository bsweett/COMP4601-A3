<meta name="summary" content="Well done but it lacks meaning"></head><body><p>A small film that is suspenseful and well done as altogether. But... Some extraterrestrials are alluded at as experimenting on human beings. But nothing is really shown of them, about them, concerning them. They are a total mystery. They are trying to erase the memory of human beings but we will never know why nor how nor what for. They are doing some experiment for the sake of doing it. Then what kind of appreciation can we put forward? Memory is both erasable and un-erasable. When we are dealing with children, abducted children, the mother has an advantage because she is going to remember the child physiologically in her own body from even before he was born. But that is rather trite. It leads to no kind of conclusion. So who can have any interest, and what interest, in erasing people's memory, that memory people love forgetting, disguising and losing as fast as they can invent some substitute recollection to replace the truth? The end then is like a happy unexplainable return of the lost and the forgotten and appears like a vague fragrance, taste or perfume wafting along in some windy corridor. The technique of the film is good but it has no depth, hence no real meaning.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></body></html>

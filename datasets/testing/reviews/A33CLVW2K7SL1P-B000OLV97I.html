My guess is that they trimmed what would have added an hour to the running time because what they trimmed was so much worse than what they kept.<br /><br />It's no surprise that Eragon feels like "The Lord of the Rings Lite", or "Star Wars Impaired", because that's what the book was. The screenwriters made no attempts, and neither did the director, to put a stamp of originality on this. That may be because they couldn't without drastically changing the events of the story. Like leaving Eragon's uncle out of the story, or Brom, or...well, perhaps even Eragon himself. (By the way, did anyone else expect to see a light saber every time Eragon flashed his sword around? I did.)<br /><br />There's a certain amount of guilt that I feel for being so critical of a story written by such a young writer. But when he is asked, "What race from your books would you choose to be?", and he answers, "A dwarf, because their language and culture is so fascinating", it soothes that guilt. He honestly believes that the dwarves have a complete language and culture. Perhaps in his mind they do, and perhaps in the minds of so many teenagers who have never read *good* fantasy they do, but for anyone who has read *good* fantasy (LOTR, for example) this rings hollow. No writer (artist) who steals so openly from others and who had half a brain or a teaspoon of common sense would say things like that. And yes, there have been many other comments made by him, similarly narcissistic.<br /><br />The acting wasn't half bad, but the dialogue (something that Paolini says is essential to make realistic) is horrid. It's also pulled nearly word by word from the text. I think that people seeing this film will have a better grasp of the weaknesses of the book, as visuals are often more striking than the written word.<br /><br />How did so many good actors get caught up into this?? My only guess is that they never read the book, never read the criticism, and thought they were going to "Ian McKellan-ize" themselves. Well...that didn't work.<br /><br />I almost gave this movie two stars because of the special effects, but the special effects nearly mirrored those of The Lord of the Rings movies. The one aspect where they could have been original (this also includes the physical appearance of the various races), and they chose not to. I cannot imagine why. The director had to know that he was dealing with a thief (even if Paolini won't acknowledge this), and he could have done so much to make this original. Again, I can't imagine why he didn't. Even with the thievery of the book's plot and characters, an original film could have been made. Sadly, it was not.</p></body></html>

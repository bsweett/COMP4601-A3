Julia Roberts gave the performance of her career in this film about a young woman who strives to save a dying community and still handle three kids ans a relationship.  The other performances that were played really well were the roles of Aaron Echeart and Albert Finney's.  The movie also has a good score and soundtrack.  The film is definately one of the best films of the 2000s.  I highly reccomend this film.</p></body></html>

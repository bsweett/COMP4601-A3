<meta name="summary" content="Reminded me of "LOTR"!!!!"></head><body><p>It is one thing to suspend belief in the first film, but here, you really have to suspend belief!!!, how this film has made 400+ million is a mystery to me, I really enjoyed the first one, the bad guys were what you would expect a pirate to be, Geoffrey Rush was a delight to watch, & a good villian, here you have Davy Jones & his "LOTR" look-alike rejects, that are nowhere near as fun to watch, these pirates, if you want to call them that, are just downright nasty & disgusting looking, & they somehow can summon a octopus called the Kraken to devour entire ships, this plot point of course is a rip-off of "Clash of the Titans",  Jerry Bruckheimer is starting to become like T.V.'s late Arron Spelling, he is a great innovator of films, like Spelling was with his shows, but once an audience is established, he could care less about his franchise's direction, like his "Bad Boys II", Bruckheimer has settled for shock value instead of substance, & does the same here for "Pirates 2" shock value is more important, midway through this film I was feeling disappointment, only Johnny Depp's over-the-top performance kept me in my seat, I personally don't like disgusting looking characters, & have no real wish to watch this one again, & did I mention, that this one is confusing, too many plot holes, & not enough of Keira Knightly, who I am sure will get slack for her actions at the end, the same way Billy Dee Williams got slack for his character's actions in "Empire Strikes Back", won't spoil it for you here, except to say you will be shocked at what she does, hopefully the third film will have some redeming value, but I doubt it, apparently shock value is more important than sustance, If you like "Lord Of The Rings", you will like this, if not, you will be disappointed, as with "The Matrix", only the original has any real substance!!!!</p></body></html>

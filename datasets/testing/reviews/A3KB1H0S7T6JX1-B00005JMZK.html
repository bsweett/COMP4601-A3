<meta name="summary" content="Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>I have to say that I am not a MAJOR fan of either the Alien or the Predator series, though I've seen all the previous movies and liked them.  So, I cannot take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that is not familiar with the "details" I have to say that the movie was pretty good!<br /><br />It is an action-packed Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider type of adventure combining significant elements of horror.<br /><br />The acting is average and the choice for lead actress was poor at best. Though she is a Halle Berry type (which is definitely a bonus) this film does not seem to be her thing, especially when she does not present her "Halle Berry qualities." Consequently she is not convincing in her role.  Moreover, the opening scenes with her receiving the phone call while climbing the mountain were weak.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the setting, the special effects, the battles and the costumes are all very good!<br /><br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch!</p></body></html>

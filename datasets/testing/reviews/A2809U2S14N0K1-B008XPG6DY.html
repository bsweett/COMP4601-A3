Several times I found it quite unbelievable eg why a person with a wife that looks like the hero's wife would go with someone else, why the victim did not go to the police, the way the shooting scene in the hotel worked out, then the failure of the police to identify the hero as the killer, the accidental way he got his money back and the final fight in the jail and the police still cannot catch the killer.<br /><br />The acting I thought was poor to reasonably good. I did like Jennifer Aniston performance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A tangled web."></head><body><p>This movie is a fantastic tangled web of emotional mystery and twists. I won't ruin it, but the story started out being what I thought was a 'kidnap' tale with an older man hurting a young girl, but it has a surprise in store for the viewer. In Act I, you are not going to be sure who to feel sorry for. Hang in there, the story unravels in emotion and action that made my husband 'squirm' (slight giggle there). I pictured guys on the set doing the same during this particular scene. The web of lies is taken apart and we know who is the true victim in the end. Movie is very well done, but I was miffed about one particular item I feel should've been answered as far as the question of a 'missing girl'. In my opinion, this loose end should've been tied up and the location of the dead girl should've been revealed. Just my opinion. However, this is a tense thriller with a lot of great dialogue and valid points made in it. Had me saying 'you tell 'em sister', more than once.  Ellen Page is simply one of the most talented young actresses out there!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

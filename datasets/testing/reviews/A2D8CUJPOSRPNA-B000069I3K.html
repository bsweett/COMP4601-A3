<meta name="summary" content="E.T., Phone Home"></head><body><p>It has been nearly twenty years since this movie was released; but even today, E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL remains one of the most fascinating movies of all times.  Steven Spielberg, like Hitchcock, DeMille, and John Ford before him, is no stranger to making masterpieces, and this is unquestionably one of them.<p>Its story of a young boy named Elliott(Henry Thomas) who befriends a very benign alien accidentally left stranded on Earth and takes it upon himself to protect the alien from government agents is so well known that there is really no need to go into extensive detail anymore.  But sprinkled throughout this masterpiece are individual moments that stand out among the greatest single moments ever put on film (the bicycle ride across the moon, the Elliott/E.T. emotional connection).  One scene that has always stood out for me personally is the first meeting between Elliott's kid sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) and E.T., in which Gertie screams her head off.  It is one of the very few times where I've wanted to laugh and scream in the same breath.<p>Winner of five Oscars, including John Williams' legendary music score, E.T. has grossed over $1 billion, and it's not surprising to see why.  This is most assuredly a story that touched the world, as its advertising says, and it continues to be highly recommended.</p></body></html>

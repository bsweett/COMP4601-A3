<meta name="summary" content="A Fun and Action packed thrill ride to Mars and back!"></head><body><p>Dwayne Johnson(The Rock) and Karl Urban star in a movie adaption of the ultra popular video game of the same name;and surprisingly it works very well.<br />The Rock,known only here as The Sarge,is one hard nosed,by the book soldier.It seems there is a level 5 security breech at Olduvai Research Station situated on the planet Mars.It's supposed to be an archeological- only dig but a very selective virus has managed to infect several members of the site team.It's up to the Sarge,his right hand man John(Urban) and the rest of the military team to go to Mars and shut down and contain the breech.To get there all must travel through the "ark".This is,for lack of a better description,like a watery ball that comes up out of the middle of the floor and when one stands close enough,one gets sucked into and transported directly to the Mars site.<br />Once the entire team arrives the adrenaline starts pumping for them and for us.They make their way methodically through the site labs,meeting up with scientist(and Urbans' sister) Samantha(Rosamund Pike).They go room by room and area by area until they start making contact with the "breech".As they "eliminate" one breech another eventually appears.It seems the lead scientists they are seeking are the ones responsible for much of the trouble and are infecting each other,but before they can fully comprehend this they are up to their elbows in trouble.<br />The Sarge,unbeknownst to the others and even himself,gets infected early on by coming in contact with comtaminated blood.As things progress his behaviour becomes more and more agressive and erratic until he orders the murder of innocent and uninfected scientists and their families and even shoots one of his own rookie soldiers.During one of the last attacks on the surviving group Urban is injured and the Sarge is taken away.In order to save her brother Samantha injects him with C-24,which is a serum derived from the ancient indigenous population of Mars who have 24 chromosomes.This has the effect of not only saving his life but heightening and enhancing his physical and mental abilities to an unheard of degree.By this time The Sarge returns pretty much converted into one of the monsters they originally came to hunt down.A battle royale ensues which ends up back on Earth,but fortunately for the moment is still contained below ground.It is a back and forth fight for life, but the Sarge is sent back to Mars with a live grenade in hot pursuit,which destroys him.<br />The movie does a good job of keeping the atmosphere dark and gloomy throughout its' 113 minutes and once the group lands on Mars the paranoic level remains high.It is so good in fact that it helps gloss over the weak spots that appear along the way,dialogue or plot related.<br />One nice spot comes at approximately the 90 minute mark where for about five minutes the movie reverts to its' gamer roots and turns into a FPS(first person shooter) demo.We become Urban,whose rifle in the foreground snakes through the corridors and around corners shooting and killing each and every creature it comes into contact with.You almost wish you had a controller in your hand to take control of the action on the screen!<br />This unrated and extended edition DVD includes several mini docs on the making of the movie,an extended FPS secquence,tips for playing the real game and if you have an X-Box you can play the Doom 3 demo right from this disc!<br />Presented in a clear and clean anamorphic 2:35:1 ratio,this movie is a heart thumping,testosterone filled 113 minute thrill ride that is bound to please.There are no moral imperatives here or lessons to be learned or multi plot twists to unravel.You just sit back and let the movie wash over you and let it do what it was intended to do.<br />Don't think.....just watch!</p></body></html>

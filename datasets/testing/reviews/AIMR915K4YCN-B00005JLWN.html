<meta name="summary" content="PROZIUM NATION..."></head><body><p>Well, World War III has happened once again, this time causing government to crush all human emotion in order to control society and eliminate further war, crime, etc. A special breed of super-cops is established to make sure that everyone remains numb and takes their Prozium? (emotion eradicating drug). All is fine until one such enforcer (Christian Bale from The Machinist, Harsh Times, American Psycho, etc.) misses his daily dose, causing his mind to clear and his emotions to activate. This leads him into a career-ruining journey of self-disovery, a true spiritual awakening, oh yeah, and several  wonderful displays of the old ultra-violence! EQUILIBRIUM deserves a top spot in the dystopian movie universe, along w/ 1984, FERENHEIT 451, BRAZIL, V FOR VENDETTA, THE MATRIX, METROPOLIS, BLADERUNNER, and other classics. Bale is astonishing as usual, once again becoming the man he portrays. Don't let this one get away...</p></body></html>

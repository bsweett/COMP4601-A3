<meta name="summary" content="By Far, the Best Biblical Epic (Despite its Being Too Long)"></head><body><p>There are many things to like about BEN HUR.  I agree with other reviewers when they say that it is, by far, the best biblical epic of its time.  The story of Judah Ben Hur is an engaging one and it has been duplicated in several films since: one can see the influence it has had on films such as GLADIATOR, SPARTACUS, and even the Sondheim musical SWEENEY TODD.  It is the tale of a man betrayed by his friend, banished from his homeland, only to return a prince.<br /><br />Despite its deserved accomplishments, I was not completely enthralled with BEN HUR.  For one thing, it is too long.  Now, I am not against watching a four hour movie (in principle).  But I am against redundancy and unnecessary length.  After watching BEN HUR for an hour, I felt as if the plot had only advanced fifteen minutes or so.  It is a testament to the film that it manages to stay engaging throughout most of its length.  But regardless of its interest, I found that several of the scenes could have been drastically shortened.  For example, there is a terribly long scene in which the ship (Ben Hur is imprisoned as a rower) is forced to "go through the paces" so that the commander can test the mettle of Hur and his companions.  The scene takes several minutes as the commander slowly increases the pace of the rowing.  On the one hand, watching the entire scene allows you to see the full measure of the men, but the same point could have been communicated in a single minute.<br /><br />Secondly, I also felt that the "Christ" story is tacked on.  Of course, the role of Jesus in Ben Hur's life is important because Jesus gives him water (and with it hope) and because it is Jesus' Passion that finally allows Ben Hur to put his hatred behind him and seek life instead of death.  Yet, despite this importance, the film drags on in its final hour.  After the breathtaking chariot sequence, the film should (for all intensive purposes) be over.  But, instead, it drags on for about an hour and the film decides to narrate much of the Passion sequence (something that could have been its own movie).  Once again, I feel that Ben Hur's redemption could have been communicated in a much more efficient manner, instead of reconstructing a forty five minute "Christ" sequence.<br /><br />But let us not focus on the bad.  I mentioned the "chariot" sequence before and everyone else does as well.  All I can say is: there's a reason.  The chariot sequence was magnificent.  I was shocked.  I would not be hesitant to say that it is one of the best action sequences that has ever been caught on camera.  There is not a single dull moment in its seven-odd-minutes of glory.  The task of filming it must have been monumental, but the payoff is well worth it.  It is, by far, the climax of the entire movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's BEN HUR, folks.  You have to see it at least once, if for no other reason than to say you have.  Of all the biblical epics, I would endorse this one the most.  Try it out.  The sheer scale of the film alone will impress you.</p></body></html>

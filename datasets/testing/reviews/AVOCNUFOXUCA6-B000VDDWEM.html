<meta name="summary" content="Relentless downer"></head><body><p>"28 Days Later" was a groundbreaking zombie movie that reinvigorated the genre.  Fast-paced, interesting and at the end optimistic, the fast zombies it introduced were a necessary part of the fast pace of the plot.  I thought it was a great movie, so I had high expectations for the sequel.<br /><br />I shouldn't have wasted my time.  With a different director and different characters, "28 Weeks Later" is just another zombie movie.  It's predictable, slow and uninteresting.  Sure, the effects are nice, and some of the photography isn't bad.  But in the end, this is a paint-by-numbers B movie that is a relentless downer from start to finish.  Avoid.</p></body></html>

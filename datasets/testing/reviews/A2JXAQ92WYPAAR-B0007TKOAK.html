What a simple idea, strangely not of this time. A classic road picture with two likable types who have nothing going for them. We love them for this finally, as do the gals they meet on their wine-tasting adventure. The actors are very charming and fully realize their parts. I especially liked Sandra Oh, who is passionate and intelligent. The guys are fine, although I wonder about seeing a lot of them - they may be too ordinary to make it in tinsel town. This is a kind of retro-60s film, it seems to me, small, counter-cultural in a way, slightly subversive of the call to success. These kinds of film made my generation love going to the movies.

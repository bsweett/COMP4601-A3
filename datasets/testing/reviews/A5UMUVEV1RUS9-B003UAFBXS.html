<meta name="summary" content="What do Elvis, JFK, mummies and convalesence homes have in common?"></head><body><p>Why the common ground of course is Bubba Ho-tep, a strange little movie that seeks to combine some of the most bizarre ingredients to form a film. I rate this with an official 3 1/2 stars because it was very fun, entertaining and strange, just as I had expected. I'd been told it was similar to Shaun of the Dead in that it's more funny and bizarre than frightful, and I agree, but that's where the similarities end. The movie cleverly comes up with an explanation that Elvis isn't dead...he's just riding out the rest of his life in a convalescence home in east Texas. The residents all start dying off and Elvis and his partner JFK now are on the hunt for a mummy that's apparently responsible. Honestly, movies don't get more silly than this when it comes to plot, but Bubba Ho-tep is a lot of fun. Just don't watch it expecting to be frightened...expect to laugh quite a bit though. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

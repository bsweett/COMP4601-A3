I have waited a long time to bother writing a review, because I know that my opinion is not popular.  The actressing is a big deal among my cinephile friends, and yet I'm put off by the bulk of it here.  Quite frankly, this is a result of too much being heaped upon too much without the right balance.  One reviewer stated that this should have been titled `The Insane, the Unhappy and the Confused'.  I agree with this.  I have defended Daldry's directorial aesthetic in the past, considering that I feel `Billy Elliot' a towering debut and `The Reader' to be a misunderstood masterpiece, but I cannot defend this since he does almost everything wrong here.  He can't build his tone in a way that complements the film's frames.  Instead, he meshes together a group of stories that interweave in a way that bleeds a melodramatic atmosphere with almost no point.  It doesn't feel inspired or poignant or engaged.<br /><br />It merely feels sad.<br /><br />The acting is stuck in the film's mood, which isn't a compliment this time.  Harris is horrific, Moore is bland, Streep is uneven and Kidman is trying way too hard (although she does fare better than the bulk of the cast).  The rest of the supporting cast is just there, although I will admit that Toni Collette and John C. Reilly make more of an impact than that the film's nominated stars.<br /><br />I like depressing, and I like challenging and I love a film that digs at the darkness in our souls, but this film is just too drab for its own good.  It doesn't say enough to validate its poor thematic choices.</p></body></html>

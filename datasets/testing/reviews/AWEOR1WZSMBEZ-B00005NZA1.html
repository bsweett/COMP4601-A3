One man continually searching his anti-thesis.  For what?  I really could not tell but maybe simply for the satisfaction of knowing that his belief, derived from comic books, is correct afterall.  What I cannot fathom though is how a paraplegic can pull off all those accidents when he obviously cannot even help himself.  Hhhmmm...strange, really strange.</p></body></html>

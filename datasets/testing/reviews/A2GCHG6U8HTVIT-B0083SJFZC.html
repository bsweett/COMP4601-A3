<meta name="summary" content="A First-Rate Movie That Just Happens To Be A Western"></head><body><p>Unforgiven is a strong, bleak movie. It's also a credit to Clint Eastwood's self confidence as a producer/director and ability as an actor that he cast Gene Hackman in such a showy role and then was able to stand up to Hackman's performance. For me, it was those two heavy-weight performances, balancing each other, that gave the movie its energy.<br /><br />However, like so many movies today, it is lo-o-ong. I think it could have lost 20 minutes and been an even better movie, just by trimming a minute or two, or more, from almost every scene.<br /><br />I'm not sure how vital the Morgan Freeman role is to the movie, other than providing a kind of weary humanity. He provides the excuse for Eastwood to throw off the skin of good citizen that his wife made him wear and become the killer he always was, but I think almost anything could have been used to do that. Without Freeman, I could see Little Bill bringing the madam and the scar-faced prostitute to the bar to once and for all find out where Eastwood and the kid are. They are secretly followed by one of the other prostitutes. Little Bill hits them a few times while his pals watch, then the madam loses her temper and refuses to be intimidated anymore by Little Bill's bullying. She attacks him verbally and accuses him in front of the others of being impotent whenever he has sneaked into the whorehouse. This enrages Little Bill. He grabs his whip and beats them to death in a pscho-sexual rage. The more he beats them the more he sweats and gets red in the face. It obvious he's having a sexual release while he's hitting them. Even his pals are uneasy and finally pull him away. The prostitute who had been secretly watching is horrified and scared to death. She knows where Eastwood is and goes to find him. Eastwood had sympathy for the madam and the other prostitute; he saw them as life's losers just as he was. And he decides to hell with trying to play by the rules. He mounts up and heads for the show down.<br /><br />I'm only half joking. Some sort of sexual inadequacy would help explain Little Bill's character and his need to be the alpha male. I can't remember if there was any explanation for Little Bill's behavior other than that he was just a bad guy.<br /><br />I think Unforgiven deserved the acclaim it received, and certainly Eastwood did.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A film that made people stand up & recognize Arnold Schwarzenegger/James Cameron Continued on T1 Robocop double feature reviews"></head><body><p>I believe this was Cameron's first film I was able to see this on VHS back in 1996 this is a Sci fi/acton/ horror film from 1984 that I now own on blu ray. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator Micheal Biehn plays Kyle Reese a soldier from 2029 he's the Ultimate protector Linda Hamilton plays Sarah Connor. So in the Year 2029 machines are the ruling class and they want to wipe out the rest of the human race and the leader is John Connor. Skynet the super computer that runs the machines send there newest invention back to 1984 to kill his mother Sarah Connor this invention a Terminator a metal endoskelon over artificial skin but looks entirely human. Kyle Reese volunteers to go after the Terminator. The story progresses well I really wish they would have kept the scene where Reese breaks down and when it show the Cyberdyne Systems sign in the ending. This movie is about survival and Sarah Connor & Reese falling in love & becoming almost disturbed as Reese & a killing machines  that kills anyone.</p></body></html>

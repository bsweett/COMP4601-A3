The script is a bit more one dimentional. Yet this is not bad since this what one expects from such a movie. It is not like one can expect a movie in the style of Ben Hur since this movie is based on action and not plot. Johnny Depp is amazing in the role of Jack Sparrow and once more he steals the show with his crazy ideas and wacky behavior. The special effects are even better then the first movie and the music adds nicely to the atmosphere. Highly recommended indeed and I easily give it 5 out of 5 stars.</p></body></html>

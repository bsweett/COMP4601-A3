I believe he died before the filming was complete.  It was also, ironically, filmed just before Tom & Nicole broke up (a bit of irony there?)  These facts alone would be enough to make this film a collector's item.  However, it also has some other things going for it as well.<br /><br />The story is about a Dr. (Tom Cruise) who is haunted by the notion that his wife (Nicole Kidman) has cheated on him.  Or, even if she didn't ACTUALLY cheat on him, she surely wanted to.  This leads him on an escapade of sexual deviance.  He considers hooking up with a girl who has a crush on him as well as soliciting the services of a prostitute.  He justifies his actions as a form of "getting even" with his spouse.<br /><br />The biggest gamble, however, is sneaking into a ritzy orgy scene where everyone is wearing masks.  The scene is bizarre and at the same time beautiful.  The ritual with the prostitutes is downright surreal.  This sets the stage for everything else that happens in the movie.<br /><br />If you're into erotic thrillers, this one belongs in your DVD collection.  Makes me wonder how much of this kind of thing really does go on in High Society places.  Also, Nicole Kidman takes her clothes off for the first time in quite awhile, and I do believe there are more nude shots of her in this film than any other movie I've ever seen her in.  That alone is worthy of the price of this DVD!</p></body></html>

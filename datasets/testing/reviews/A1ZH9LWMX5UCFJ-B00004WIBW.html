<meta name="summary" content="Burton's brilliant twist on a classic"></head><body><p>I really had no expectations before watching this movie but REALLY enjoyed it. I can't add much to what has already been said by others, and agree it is destined to become a classic. Johnny Depp plays another nervous, eccentric, brilliant character and Miranda Richardson & Christopher Walken do not disappoint. Tim Burton puts his macabre signature on a classic tale with some strange new twists. Every time I thought I had it figured out I was proven wrong and the figurative fog lifting at the end was a nice touch.</p></body></html>

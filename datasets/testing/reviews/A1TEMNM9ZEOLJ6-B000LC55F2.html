<meta name="summary" content="A little confusing"></head><body><p>At 2 hours 10 minutes, this could have ended much sooner and been a tauter film as a result. The ending left me scratching my head just a bit. Most of the movie is a bit jerkily edited, so viewers have to pay attention. Are we in the present? The recent past? The future? It keeps jumping around, somewhat annoyingly. The second half bogs down a bit. I had to pause several times out of boredom, never a good sign for a movie. Was it really like this in the Victorian era? I wasn't entirely convinced. I did do one double take: yes, that's David Bowie as Tesla, the electrician, though what that was all about, I still don't know.</p></body></html>

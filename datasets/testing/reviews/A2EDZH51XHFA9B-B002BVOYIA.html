The movie is marked by a number of fine, understated minor performances, including small turns from Joaquin Phoenix and Jean Reno, as well as excellent work from Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo (as Rusesabagina's wife), and, somewhat surprisingly, Nick Nolte, whose career has really taken an upswing since Affliction.<br /><br />Not that the movie doesn't have its flaws; I'd have liked to see a lot more development in Gregoire's character, given how important he becomes towards the end of the film, for example; but what's here is sterling. Cheadle plays Rusesabagina as a consummate businessman, the kind of guy who's going to try not to rock the boat for as long as humanly possible, the most reluctant of heroes. His character stays believable even when everything else about him has entered the realm of the ludicrous. (You won't believe the film's ending until you read the little "what happened to...?" snippets afterwards.) Impressive, that.<br /><br />A fantastic film. Definitely recommended. ****</p></body></html>

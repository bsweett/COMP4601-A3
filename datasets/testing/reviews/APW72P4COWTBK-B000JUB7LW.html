<meta name="summary" content="DANCES WITH WOLVES Part 2!"></head><body><p>This movie is NOT the sequel to Dances with Wolves! It's just the same movie except that instead of indians these are samurais!!<br /><br />Of course, this movie have MORE ACTION than Dances with Wolves, more warfare, more cool fights and more blood!!! I could say that Last Samurai is better than Dances but ONLY because of the action, the story is a little predictable but still interesting.<br /><br />P.S: If you have seen Dances with Wolves then you obviouslly note the differences between this one and Dances, but basically they are the same.<br /><br />Adios.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good departure from the original"></head><body><p>This is very far from the original by Washington Irving, so far that it is really a completely different work of art.  While in the original Icobod, is a kind of local twit of a teacher - pompous, lacking self awareness, ridiculously awkward - in this he is a big city "scientific" investigator who comes to the provincial town.  Moreover, Irving's tale never quite enters the supernatural, but instead is a parody that leaves much to the imagination.<br /><br />That being said, Depp creates a very good character:  a bit of a dork, but courageous in overcoming his fear.  THe atmosphere is as vivid and dense as one would expect from Burton, with excellent actors adding to it.  It is more of a traditional horror story that is tied off rather than left open, which I regretted.<br /><br />Recommended for fans.</p></body></html>

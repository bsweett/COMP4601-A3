<meta name="summary" content="Faulty acting can't quite undermine terrifying tale"></head><body><p>There is a scene early in "The Sum of All Fears" where Morgan Freeman's character, Bill Cabot (deputy CIA director), tells Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan (now, a young CIA turk) to "pay attention, because you are about to breath air that's way over your pay grade".  Freeman could very well have been speaking to Affleck in a real-life conversation in reference to acting.  Freeman's mere presence runs circles around Affleck's attempts to act.  Unfortunately, that is one negatives that prevents "Sum..." from being more of a landmark movie.  I struggled with the decision over whether to give this movie 3 or 4 star.  In the end, the acting deficiencies by some of main characters and some of the too-convenient plot devices, caused me to settle on 3 stars.<p>While Affleck's acting left something to be desired, I can't be totally critical of his performance.  He really did try.  He put forth as workman-like an effort as anyone could hope for.  He just simply does not have the talent or presence to fill the formidable shoes of an action hero like Jack Ryan.  Action hero roles are proving to be a difficult type of acting.  Add to that the premise of this movie, a nuclear attack on Baltimore followed by mounting tensions between the U.S. and Russia in its aftermath, and you have a tall order for any actor to fill.  The true acting disaster in this movie belongs to Bridget Moynahan who plays his girl friend (soon-to-be wife) Cathy Muller.  Moynahan's most notable previous work was as one of the dancing waitresses in "Coyote Ugly", not exactly a stellar pedigree.  Maybe in time she will improve as an actress, but in "Sum of All Fears", Moynahan shows absolutely no acting or emotional range.  Baltimore is in ruins, her boyfriend is off risking his life to prevent a full-scale nuclear war, she has to deal with nuclear victims at her hospital and her expression would make one think she was annoyed at missing a sale at Macy's, not that she has just witnessed one of the greatest tragedies visited upon U.S. soil.<p>Having said my piece about two the main leads, let me focus now on the rest of the movie.  The plot for "Sum of All Fears" is a very sobering one (and one that several real-life experts find to be very plausible).  With the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise to nuclear power status of many Middle East nations, it's not inconceivable that a terrorist cell could get their hands on a single nuclear weapon and transport it to the United States.  In this movie, an Israeli jet equipped with a nuclear bomb is shot down during a skirmish between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors in 1973.  Fast forward a few decades and the bomb has been unearthed by some scavengers who are unaware of its true purpose.  A group of Nazi-loyalists track down the rogue bomb and procure it for their purposes.  The purposes being destroying a major U.S. city and making it appear that Russia was behind it in order to start a full scale nuclear war between to the two nations.  In the aftermath, the Nazi's plan to use the chaos to reclaim worldwide power (at least that seems to be the plan.  It's not extraordinarily clear).  The concept of a nuclear terrorist attack is a very scary, very real scenario that hits home even harder in the aftermath of 9/11 and the discovering of an Al-Qaeda member planning to set off a radioactive 'dirty bomb'.  This situation is handled with appropriate degrees of plausibility.  The suddenness of the nuclear detonation in Baltimore combined its signature shockwaves and mushroom cloud are visions that are horrifying to view makes one hope to never have to in real life.  The reactions by the President (played ably by James Cromwell) and the rest of his cabinet seem very real and very human.  They aren't ice-cold, calm, and calculating in determining how to respond to this devastation.  They react emotionally, confused, and frustrated.  It is how one would expect leaders to react behind closed doors during such a tremendous crisis.  One would think President Bush and his advisors had moments similar to those in the movie in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.  The rising tension as one incident after another pushes the U.S. and Russia closer to nuclear war is palpable.  It's frightening to see how, for the right money and opportunity, such plans can come to fruition.<p>"Sum of All Fears" is a well-done movie and will leave the audience captivated as they watch the progression of events.  There is just a feeling, though, that this movie could have been something more with different casting choices.</p></body></html>

Adapted for the screen by Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential, Payback, Blood Work) from the book of the same name by Dennis Lehane, the writers take what typically would have been a simplistic murder mystery/thriller and turned it into one of the most engrossing, fascinating, and heartbreaking films I've seen all year.  Essentially, "Mystic River" is about how the past never leaves us and how the events in our past, especially in our childhood, affect us as we grow older and lastly, how grief affects people differently, in both good and bad ways.<p>The movie follows the individual fates of three childhood friends and their families, Jimmy Marcus (Sean Penn), Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins), Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon), whose lives were forever changed by a nightmarish childhood incident.  The pain resulting from this incident and another that occurs to one of their children when the friends are adults is a metaphor for the river of grief (thus the title) that, unbeknownst to them all, binds each of these men together.  Grief, as it always does, brings each of the men closer together, but ultimately results in tragedy for everyone involved.<p>Hands down, this is one of the finest casts ever to be assembled on screen.  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney.  Wow, can it get any better than that?  And it's not as if these actors are all just thrown together with no chemistry whatsoever.  They all work together so well and none of the actors end up stealing the spotlight.  Each actor disappears into their roles with startling ease, leaving their big Hollywood names behind and truly becoming their characters, Boston accents and all.<p>My only problem with this film is its last act.  Fore me, it simply did not live up to the high caliber artistry of the rest of the movie.  I was so engrossed in this film and was expecting an ending to match it, but found myself ultimately dissatisfied with the solution the writer offered.  I felt as if he'd "taken the easy way out".</p></body></html>

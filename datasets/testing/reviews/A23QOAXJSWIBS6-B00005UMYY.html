<meta name="summary" content="Ground-breaking and thoroughly watchable film"></head><body><p>Be prepared to watch Memento several times.  There is much more going on than may meet the eye at first glance.  Director/Writer Nolan is doing much more than telling a tale in an innovative fashion.  He is making statements about reality and human experience whether he intended to or not.<p>The narrative loop in the film, far more than a gimmick, unseats us from the comfortable theater seat and makes us sit up an take notice.  By the end of the film, we have (hopefully!) figured out what exactly is going on to Leonard/Lenny.  It's a shame he has no clue -- or does he?<p>I've always thought Guy Pearce was a great actor, and this is easily his best work to date (with LA Confidential a close second).  Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are brilliant in the supporting cast.  I just wish this film had garnered more acclaim than it did.<p>Unfortunately I haven't found any of Nolan's work since to be all that memorable, but he has proven himself to be both insightful and capable of crafting a stunning piece of ground-breaking cinema.<p>One wish for the DVD -- on Nolan's &quot;Following&quot; we had the option of watching the film &quot;in order.&quot;  I really wanted that option here.  Not that I need it to help the film make sense, but just to get one step deeper into this wonderfully crafted film.  Now that I know the ending from the beginning, why not turn it on its head and see what we can see from another angle.</p></body></html>

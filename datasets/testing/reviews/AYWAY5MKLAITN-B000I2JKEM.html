<meta name="summary" content="Deathly Beautiful."></head><body><p>It is a touching story that follows in the tradition of Nightmare Before christmas. And that is saying something! I couldn't believe that Tim Burton would top himself! But he did. This movie has a voice all it's own and deserves to be seen. Nothing is more beautiful and tragically touching as a mistake in wedding arangements . . .especially to a corpse.</p></body></html>

His sister, Sheryl, seems to be the only sane member of this dysfunctional family.  Well, maybe I'll include Olive, the family's youngest.<br /><br />Sheryl's husband is a motivational speaker, who is trying to get his book published.  Sheryl's oldest, Dwayne, is a determined teenager who has vowed to silence until he enlists in the Air Force.  Living with the family is Sheryl's father-in-law, who has been evicted from a retirement community for doing drugs.  He coaches Olive on her competition.<br /><br />The movies focuses on slightly plump Olive and the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.  This all starts when Olive gets a call that the regional winner has stepped down.  By default as the runner-up, Olive gets to compete in this envious competition.  In response, the entire family drops their plans, band together in a VW bus and travel through a few states for the pageant.<br /><br />One may think that there's nothing exciting that occurs during road trips.  Not with this family, they are THE poster family of dysfunctionality.<br /><br />All I can say is that if you like family dynamics no matter how chaotic they can be, then you'll enjoy *Little Miss Sunshine*.  My favorite part was when Dwayne has a meltdown, forces the family to pull off the road and storms off in a field.  Everyone in the family tries to coax him back but with no success.  However, as a last resort, Olive comes to her brother and just simply rests her head on his shoulder.  There's something special about that bond because he comes back.<br /><br />The pageant is a little freaky especially if you have never seen the kind that Jon Benet competed in.  Get ready to be shocked.<br /><br />Anyways, no matter how chaotic this family is, they still manages to remain a close one especially in support of Olive's competition.</p></body></html>

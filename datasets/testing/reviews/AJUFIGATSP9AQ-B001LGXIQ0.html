<meta name="summary" content="TV Show gets Decent Update with Style"></head><body><p>Mild and missing a beat hear and there; it is as perfect as possible for an update of this comedic Borscht Belt Bond creation. The mood is intact. Carell and Hathaway are hot. Story is not. My only defense against those who don't like it,...is The TV star Don Adams, being in that moment and the hot writing team, timing and period of the TV show made a hit.<br />That was then, this is now. Picture is digiperfect but I'm getting spoiled by the new HD sound formats; so the best thing I can say about this Dolby track is that I don't have to worry about my neighbors.</p></body></html>

This movie is based on the true story of Chris Gardner, a salesman, that went from selling medical scanners to being a stock broker for Dean Witter. That of course is not the amazing part of the story. The true test he endured was managing to raise a son while he was flat broke and chasing down his stolen scanners. Will Smith gives a dramatic performance that will not easily be bested by others that have done them so well. He obviously reached down deep to pull up a true understanding of suffering as a poor father that would give anything to provide for his family. Thandie Newton turns in a wonderful performance as his wife and Janden Smith does a fine job as his son. This movie takes us along with a father from the brink of disaster to the heights of joy and happiness. Keep the Kleenex handy. Good quality DVD with a few standard extras.</p></body></html>

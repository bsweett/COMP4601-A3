It was pretty humorous to me, yes the swearing and some of the jokes did make the movie lose points but hey that's an Adam Sandler comedy for you. If you look past that you can see this movie was pretty humorous and there were actors that kept this movie up. I find the plot overall interesting and the ending I rather enjoyed. It wasn't the same old cliche stuff and I liked that. It isn't the most funniest comedy I know from Sandler, but I thought it was a good one from him.<br /><br />I know people who have seen the older version of Longest Yard and they said, despite the swearing, it was an actual good remake of it. And from the humor I found from Sandler's version, I may just watch the older version. I give the new version though a good 3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

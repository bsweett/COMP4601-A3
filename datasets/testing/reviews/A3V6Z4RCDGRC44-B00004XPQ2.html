<meta name="summary" content="Excellent insight into the minds of soldiers"></head><body><p>It may be hard for some in today's &quot;every man for himself&quot; mentality to relate to the strong personal honor that underlies many characters in this movie. The central 'combat of wills' is between Saito, the Japanese ruler of a prison camp deep in asia, and Nicholson, who is a traditional multi-decade British soldier that has lived his entire adult life within the rules and structure of that system. <p>As a lover of feudal Japanese culture, I found it fascinating as Saito claimed the heritage of &quot;Bushido&quot; (the 'way of the warrior' of the samurai), yet had no problem using all prisoners as slave labor in order to save his own neck. Instead of following the Geneva Convention and treating the prisoners as the &quot;rules&quot; insisted, he bent them in order to not have to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) because the train bridge was not finished in time.<p>On the other hand, Nicholson refused to allow Saito to use his officers as laborers (although he didn't seem to mind his *men* being sent off to work the tracks) and goes into The Oven to suffer as a consequence. Later, when work is running behind, he even goes into the hospital and talks the sick men into helping out - risking their health and lives for the 'common good' of the railway (which in fact is helping his *enemy*).<p>I wish the movie were a bit longer, so we could go even deeper into the various characters. Each one has been molded by time and experience into a certain lifestyle, and each has doubts at time that he has chosen the correct path. A fascinating movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining Future-Noir Never Looked and Sounded Better In Blu!"></head><body><p>I have to disclose right at the start that I have never read an Isaac Asimov book and so I can only judge the movie without any reference to the book it is based upon.  Now that I've got that out of the way, I also have to say that I have always liked film noir and so movies that are even remotely noir-ish like this one and say "Blade Runner" or even "Gattaca" have a headstart with me.  That said, while the movies share similarities with each other e.g. the Smith and Harrison cop characters after renegade artificial life forms etc "I, Robot" rises above just being a shoot-em up, all action film but also appeals to a thinking audience raising the issue of bigotry and prejudice with Smith's hatred of all things robot based upon his one bad experience with them and how all this changes once he gets to know and understand them better.  There are some elements though that detract from the enjoyment of the movie such as the inclusion of scenes that are not necessary; while I am fan of Shia LeBeuf for example from his work on "The Greatest Game Ever Played" I thought his scenes were totally useless here and that the film would be far better off without any of his scenes.  I also got the feeling that the film was too short and that far more meat could have been included to the story to develop the main characters more.<br /><br />The good storyline aside though this movie has excellent 1080p picture and sound quality coming in DTS HD 5.1 MA making this a strong candidate for reference quality blu-ray disc.  The special feature documentaries while not great are still pretty good and unless you are a diehard fan who has to have every single tidbit this average viewer for instance is happy with this release.<br /><br />This blu-ray release has excellent picture and sound quality and a decent storyline making this a worthy reference disc in your video library.<br /><br />Recommended for the picture and sound quality but perhaps the content could have been a little better.</p></body></html>

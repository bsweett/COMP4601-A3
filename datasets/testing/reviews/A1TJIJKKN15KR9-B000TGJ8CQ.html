<meta name="summary" content="Cage's Latest Action Junker Lacks Soul, Smarts and Style"></head><body><p>Clear proof that not all Philip K. Dick short stories have enough substance for a feature film. Desperately short on creativity, Next takes a clever original concept (precognitive masquerades as a low-level Vegas magician) and promptly spins it into a pulpy blob of action goop. Along the way it mixes in a roomful of to-the-letter FBI stereotypes, a painfully shoehorned love story and a weirdly under-explained cell of nuke wielding French terrorists. Even the mindless action scenes are toothless, as Nic Cage's future-weary prophet sees every bullet coming before the gun's even drawn, basically playing the part of Neo without the presence of an Agent Smith to counter his moves. Nic Cage is his usual anti-charismatic self, old and burnt-out at a glance, but the real surprise isn't how low Cage sinks - it's how far Julianne Moore is willing to follow. Both players imbue their roles with such a wooden lack of emotion that I wouldn't be surprised to learn the entire film was comprised of first takes. Dull, passionless and predictable, it's a futile waste of ninety minutes.</p></body></html>

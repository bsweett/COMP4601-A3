Gorgeously filmed, the movie is merely a look at the Emperor Penguins incredible mating ritual.  The loveable creatures start off on their 70 mile trek to mate, and encounter the incredible hardships of the Antarctic winter.  With narration by Morgan Freeman, the viewer witnesses the remarkable natural phenomenon in which the penguins face oppressive odds in their quest to propagate and survive.  With a sumptuous background musical score and wonderful photography, MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is a fascinating and entertaining documentary that should make the human race take a second look at what family values really are.  Faced with these kind of odds, I wonder if we could be so resilient and dedicated.  A delightfully engrossing entertainment for all.</p></body></html>

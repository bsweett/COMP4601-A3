<meta name="summary" content="Eli Roth does it again"></head><body><p>Eli Roth is quickly making a huge name for himself in the modern world of horror filmmaking.  With the debut Cabin Fever, Roth showed us his wide, unflinching knowledge of the great horror movies from the 70s and 80s that gave him his inspiration.  While Cabin Fever was more of an homage film, with story not really being the focal point, Hostel is pretty much a straigt-up horror film, and a great one at that.<br /><br />Josh and Paxton are two American backpackers in college who are taking a road trip to Europe to get away and relax before they both go into the next phase of their lives (law school, etc.).  Along their trip, they meet up with Oli, an Icleandic backpacker who is just as wild and offensive as the two Americans.  We aren't really engineered to care much about these main characters.  The first half of the movie is more about all the wild, deranged things that go on in Europe, and how easy it is to get women, drugs, or whatever you want.  Basically a soft-core porn film, the opening 45 minutes of Hostel serves purely as setup for the horrible, disgusting things that we all know are coming.  After visiting a hostel in Bratislava, Josh and Paxton get a little worried when Oli disappears without a word of goodbye or anything.  So they both set out to find out what happened to them, and they both get lured into the trap that has been set for many young, stupid foreigners to get what's coming to them.<br /><br />Once the torture sequences start, the movie changes completely, obviously.  Surprisingly, I found none of the gore really shocking, or anything that new to me, but then again, I have seen pretty much any horror movie you can name.  The gore isn't amazing, but the acting is surprisingly good, and the atmosphere is truly amazing, creepy, and disconcerting.  Rather than being a real "horror" film, this movie falls more into the "shock and disgust" category than it does into the scare category.<br /><br />Eli Roth really has grown as a filmmaker.  If you watch Cabin Fever, and then watch Hostel, you can see many differences that make Hostel a much better movie.  Hostel is much more suttle and controlled than Cabin Fever was.  Cabin Fever was so chaotic and random, that you didn't know what was going on half the time.  Hostel, on the other hand, knows exactly what it wants to do, and the entire movie is focused around making a singular point.  Also, I loved the ending of Hostel.  I know a lot of people who were disappointed and thought it was too cliched, but personally, I thought that it was a well thought out ending, and it didn't make the viewers leave the theater feeling absolutely depressed and suicidal.<br /><br />The other part of Hostel that I loved was a single scene near the end of the film, when one of the characters actually gets dragged into a conversation with one of the torturers.  This dialogue is great, and it is with this dialogue that Roth makes the point he wants to make with this movie.  You can really take any point you want out of it, but I felt that Roth was trying to send a message about human nature, and the dark rivers that run throughout each of us at certain moments of time.  Let's just say that Sigmund Freud would love this movie.</p></body></html>

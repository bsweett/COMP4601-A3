Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly provide that classiness.  Cool and brazen Grace, subtlely provoking Jimmy at every turn, knowing he is stuck helpless with a broken leg in a cast, while she cavorts about getting too close to the murderer, and enjoying his nervousness.  The murderer is played by Ramond Burr in a strange role for him--but he is very scary.  In a stroke of genius, Hitchcock provides us a cutaway view of the appartments across the way and the dramas going on inside of them.  We start getting invested in the stories of the inhabitants.  Thelma Ritter adds something to the movie that it could not do without.  As Stewart's private duty nurse, her no-nonsence philosophies of life are very necessary for thorough scene development.  I never get tired of watching this movie.  Barbara Bel Geddes is also very good as Jimmy's secretary.</p></body></html>

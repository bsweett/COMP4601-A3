CARS certainly has dazzling animation and its basic selfish guy gets a heart premise will probably find its way into the hearts of the families that watch it.  Is it really all that different?  Other than the fact that the characters are CARS, it's really just a rehash of films like ICE AGE, OVER THE HEDGE, ETC. ETC.  But one can't deny it's entertainment value.  Randy Newman's delightful song OUR TOWN will probably garner him another nomination, and the voicing is really fun.  Owen Wilson is speedster Lightning McQueen, the hero whose self-importance takes a bruising when he finds himself in the small almost deserted town of Radiator Springs.  There he meets a Porsche lawyer voiced by Bonnie Hunt; a towtruck named Mater which is Larry the Cable Guy; and a former racing hero named Hudson Hornet played by Paul Newman.<br /><br />There are some cute moments and the animation IS brilliant, so CARS is a fun film to enjoy.</p></body></html>

The plot is not all that original, as it takes from many oriental movies of the same genre. However, the acting, direction, score and settings make this effort stand out and shine. The fight sequences could be ridiculous and childish, still director Ang Lee injects a sense of style and beauty in most of them and achieves something unique. This is a well-crafted story that manages to be compelling and thought-provoking. It`s also a good alternative to most Hollywood full around, presenting something that tries to innovate and deliver a somewhat surprising achievement. The characters are tragic and flawed enough, and the basic concept of good vs bad actually works here. The ending is particularly poetic and moving, providing a memorable finale to this enticing epic.<p>Recommended.</p></body></html>

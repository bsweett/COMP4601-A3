The title basically tells you about what you are going to watch leaving little to really see.  Maybe a different title and few adjustments here or there could have made it better.  Overall, if your a Denzel Washington fan for sure worth a watch but look towards 'The Last Boy Scout' or 'The Taking of Pelham 123' for a better Tony Scott production.<br /><br />Peter J.

While 2 does not aim for the character depth we got with the Asian characters, it does pack a wallop with sheer visceral punch.  Louis Leterrier moves up from the Artistic Director of the original to direct this film.  Moved to Miami, it gives the film a different look and different toys.  (Leterrier followed this film with "Unleashed" with Jet Li.)  As Frank Martin, Jason Statham shows he's a great action star.  Building on "Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" + a stint as the heavy in "Cellular," he shines stage center as the Transporter.  Amber Valetta from "Raising Helen" and her excellent appearance in "Hitch" does a good job as mother Audrey who puts concerns on her kidnapped son & floundering marriage.  Matthew Modine as Jefferson Billings does a journeyman's job as the emotional lightweight father/husband.  Jason Flemyng as the fake doctor Dimitri has a great character face that should result in many more film appearances in addition to "Layer Cake."  As the criminal kingpin, Alessandro Gassman, son of Vittorio Gassman, turns in a chilling performance as the ruthless criminal mastermind.  (I'd forgotten that I'd seen him in a very different role in "Steam: The Turkish Bath.")  The fight sequence with Statham on the plane is a stellar brawl.  Hunter Clary's first film as young Jack Billings shows the child actor off with a good range.  He's a cute witty kid!  Also in her freshman effort, Kate Nauta turns in the memorable performance as the amoral Lola who is comfortable in underwear, stiletto heels and a machine gun.  Perhaps the plot about a 24-hour virus is a bit improbable, but it keeps the pace of the movie running at full throttle.  This is an excellent sophomore effort.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

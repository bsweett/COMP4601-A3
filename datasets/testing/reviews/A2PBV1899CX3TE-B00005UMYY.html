<meta name="summary" content="A memento of Christopher Nolan's inception"></head><body><p>Though Memento wasn't Christopher Nolan's very first film, it was his first shot at the big time, as Doodlebug was a 3 minute short and Following was a student film made on a budget of under $6,000. So, you could call Memento a memento of Christopher Nolan's inception as a professional director. It is based on a story that his brother Jonathan wrote about a man who suffers from Anterograde Amnesia--the inability to form new memories after damage to the hippocampus. This character is named Leonard Shelby and he is played by the versatile Australian Actor, Guy Pearce:<br /><br />---------<br />Leonard Shelby: It's just an anonymous room. There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway. Nothing except the Gideon bible, which I, of course, read religiously.<br />===============<br /><br />Pearce is really good in this, and though the premise has a built in catch--since he can't remember anything he continuously says the same things and tells the same stories until the people he meets and the audience are both totally fed up--I enjoyed his performance a lot. Leonard is bent on getting revenge on the man who murdered his wife, but his memory problem not only makes this especially difficult--he takes notes, Polaroids, and even has important "facts" tattooed on himself in a futile attempt to keep track of it all--it also makes us doubt the veracity of his subjective view of reality. Is he really on track to get revenge, or is he being manipulated by others with their own agendas? And if he does get revenge, how will he enjoy that dish--best served cold--if he can't even remember it being served? And even the memories he does have, the ones formed before the accident, how does he know that they are true?<br /><br />Leonard Shelby--and the other characters, too--are all the ultimate Unreliable Narrators. I first heard the term in conjunction with the novel The Good Soldier by Ford Maddox Ford, but if you watch the director's interview in the DVD bonus material, Nolan uses it to describe Leonard. Such elevated concepts and questioning of the very nature of reality are the hallmarks of Nolan's films. He is a rare director who can both toy with philosophy and a big budget, and still fill the seats. An art house director whose films are blockbusters. Memento, while certainly no blockbuster, was at least successful enough to allow him to keep making films. I have not seen Inception yet, but it seems to be doing very well at the box office, while sporting a convoluted and deep plot that once again questions the nature of reality. Both Memento and Inception remind me in a way of The Matrix, and by the way, the other two supporting cast members--Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano--were both in The Matrix as Trinity and Cypher respectively. They are both feeding Shelby stories that may or may not be true. In Memento, who isn't an Unreliable Narrator?<br /><br />The fun of watching Memento is putting together the pieces of the puzzle. It alternates between flashback scenes, which are in black and white, and color scenes that are present time, moving forward. The chronology of this approach is identical to the way F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby with each flashback sequence going further and further back in time until at the end the puzzle of Gatsby's greatness is solved. Now that I think of it, Nick Carraway was also a kind of Unreliable Narrator, because the first thing he says is:<br /><br />In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.<br /><br />"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."<br /><br />And Carraway then proceeds to use the rest of the book to harshly judge and criticize just about everyone, advantaged or not.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790734850">L.A.

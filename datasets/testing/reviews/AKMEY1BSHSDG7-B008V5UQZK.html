But, it sure is one of the funniest, most heart-warming movies I've seen in years. If you are Greek, Italian, German, Irish or Anything, you will see something of your family in this film. More importantly, it will leave you with a feeling of hope for the world, because we all share these family relationships in one way or another.<br /><br />Yet another reason My Big Fat Greek Wedding is one of the best feel-good movies around is that it pokes fun at the characters and their relationships without a touch of nastiness or venom.<br /><br />This movie absolutely belongs in every family's DVD collection.</p></body></html>

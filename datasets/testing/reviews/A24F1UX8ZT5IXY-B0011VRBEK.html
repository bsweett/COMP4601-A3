<meta name="summary" content="Incredible technique, but a disgusting apologia for violence and sex crime."></head><body><p>First of all, Oldboy really only has one film with which you can compare it and that's Fight Club. Yet whereas Fincher's film explored the origins of, and visceral release of violence, this guy Park just loves the stuff and there seems to be no limit to the lengths he will exploit it for cinematic gain. All wrapped safely in sarcasm and black humor of course. The tone of the original Japanese manga is considerably different; it is much more of an intense, existential story of a man losing his identity.<br /><br />Yes, it is quite jaw-dropping how well this guy can stage a scene and elicit dry humor amidst total degradation. He also knows good music and the film looks extremely cool with its color palette, endless reams of rotting geometric wallpaper and first-rate art direction. Some of the coolest titles you'll lay eyes on as well.<br /><br />But this film crosses the line into repulsive ethical territory without condemning it. This is all started in American Films of the 60s with treating criminals and violent acts with sympathy -- but Oldboy wallows in horrendous acts of brutality and treats them like a video game. Even worse is the sexuality of the film, which progresses from unsettling to extremely disturbing by the end. And make no mistake about it, Park really is offering an apologia to a sex crime that has been degenerate for millenia in any civilized society. Unbelievable. You can accuse me of American parochialism but I think this film transcends the usual frame of reference: wanker Hollywood endings or Judeo-Christian hypocrisy.<br /><br />So, it is difficult to rate a film of such talent and technique while not hating it for what it is saying. "Just because I am a beast...." Give me a break.</p></body></html>

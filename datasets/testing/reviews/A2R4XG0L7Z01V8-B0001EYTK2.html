<meta name="summary" content="Up along with Halloween, as a &quot;horror&quot; movie"></head><body><p>Halloween (the original) has recently been named the scariest horror movie. The first (and last) time I watched that movie, I was so bored! This movie is the exact same. Labelled a horror movie, it's overly long, and apart from a few gory scenes, didn't do anything for me. I am one of those people who needs a movie which will make me jump out of my skin, hiding behind a cushion/couch/guy, and makes me want to stop watching. Definitely wanted to stop watching during this! Just when you think the film is over, another scene appears. And another. And another. And you're exhausted by the time it finally finishes, just because you've been waiting for it to finish for so long!<p>There was a bit of a heated discussion after it finished, involving why horror movies always have teenagers as their main cast (think of something different, PLEASE), similarities between this, and many other movies of the same genre (Blair Witch Project, the Friday 13th movies etc). What I did accept as a valid point during the 'discussion', was that it showed you who the killers was practically straight away, whereas many other films (the Scream trilogy, and Urban Legend come to mind) are films that you know the killer is likely to be one of the cast (obviously), but you have to work it out.<p>Particularly regarding the camera work, this movie is along the same lines as Blair Witch Project (another movie that didn't really hit me until the last 5-10 minutes). During the credits you see some very strange cutaway scenes that don't seem to fit into the movie, and are filmed on a very shaky, gritty, 16mm hand held camera. These were filmed in Rob Zombie's (NOT his real name obviously) basement after filming wrapped. He would invite cast members over to his house on the weekends and shoot the footage himself with a 16mm hand-held camera. With the exception of the shot of a setting sun, he created the opening credits the same way.<p>I found myself very bored during this movie, and frequently eyed up the clock, finding it was only a couple of minutes since I last looked. This is definitely not a movie I would watch again, I'd like to keep precious hours of my life thank you very much.</p></body></html>

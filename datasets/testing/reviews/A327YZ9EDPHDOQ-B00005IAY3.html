<meta name="summary" content="After 30 years it is still a Spielberg masterpiece!"></head><body><p>This is a movie that truly proves "We are not alone"! Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors in cinema today. This 1977 classic features a superb cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr and Francois Truffaut. The visual effects are spellbinding. If you are not a fan of science fiction, give "Close Encounters" a try. It's a great film for the family!</p></body></html>

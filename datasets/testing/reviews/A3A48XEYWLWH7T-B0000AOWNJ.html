<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, effectively creepy horror"></head><body><p>It's heartening that effective suspense and horror can still come out of Hollywood in this era of Scream, Scary Movie, and the remnants of moronic teen fair [Freddy vs Jason].  Not since Blair Witch and to a lesser extend, Jacob's Ladder has a movie like this creeped me out.  Taking itself completely seriously, there are no moments of humour and that contributes to the crawling terror.  In a gritty, almost monochrome colored setting, four teens die a week after watching a mysterious video tape.  The tape falls into the hands of a reporter, one of the kids' Aunt, who is trying to find out why her niece died.  She watches the tape as does her sensitive son and the boys estranged father.  She is told by the mysterious phone call that she now has 7 days to live.  The race is then on to solve the mystery of this tape, its origins and its demonic hold on the viewers.  Slowly, like an onion, the movies' layers are stripped away with hallucinogenic imagery and strange revelations.  The protagonists start their research on the NET, move to moldy public library sources, and ultimately to insane asylum records.  Eventually, the drama reaches its conclusion with additional jumps and starts all the way through.  Amazingly, this film got away with a PG-13 rating despite it's nightmarish imagery.  Very effective, brilliantly creepy film.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

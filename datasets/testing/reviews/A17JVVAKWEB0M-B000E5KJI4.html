Thus begins one of history's most famous tales, as the Spartans and Greeks load up the boats and sail across the Aegean Sea toward Troy, to retrieve the woman who literally launched a thousand ships.<br /><br />"Troy" focuses on one man, Achilles, on one of those ships.  Played by Brad Pitt, Achilles leads the men from the field, even though he is torn about whether thousands of men should die in order to return one woman to a man she left.  Filmed on the picturesque blazing beaches of Malta, "Troy" is full of action, love and a few too many shots of half-naked Pitt.<br /><br />Not as aesthetically ambitious as other historical epics like Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, Troy is more concerned with telling a good story in the populist sense. It is not a film for teachers of English or History to use as an example of what is known about the Trojan War; those familiar with Homer's source material may be somewhat disappointed with the liberties taken (even though Homer took some himself). The film is essentially an inaccurate re-telling of a story we know is already full of inaccuracies.<br /><br />But holding up this film to the original work of Homer misses the point entirely. The filmmakers knew an accurate depiction would be impossible to make and even more impossible to sell. They borrow the spirit from The Iliad and transform it into a modern action film. In doing so, director Wolfgang Peterson creates a film that will thrill and captivate the same viewers that would never see the version Homer intended.</p></body></html>

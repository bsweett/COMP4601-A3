<meta name="summary" content="If you like Adam Sandler, then this version is OK.  But the 1974 version still has its strengths"></head><body><p>If you don't know the original with Burt Reynolds, while not a horrible movie, this movie still has a big problem:  Adam Sandler is simply too small with too non-athletic a physique to be believable as an MVP quarterback from the NFL.  When the original came out in 1974, a six foot quarterback was still believable and the six foot eight giants of today were still rare.  Nowadays, someone who is five foot ten is simply too small except as a running back or a wide receiver.<br /><br />That aside, the movie does take a few twists from the original.  Some are good and some make the movie quite ridiculous.  I like the fact that the football to the groin is thrown at a crooked ref rather than a player.  One change I thought was particularly weak was making the idea of the guards playing the prisoners something new.  In the original it was something that happened every year, but the prisoners were simply beat up and the "superstar" was there to give them an edge.  Here, the quarterback is supposed build a team from nothing to a semi-pro quality team in a month.  I don't think so.  Another thing, Eddie Albert as the warden in the original is a lot more sinister than the mean but feckless James Cromwell is in this version.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is about as raucous for our time as the original was for its.  However, the murder of caretaker is less gruesome and shocking in this remake than it was in the original.  If you want to watch Adam Sandler in a fairly mindless movie, this is OK.  However, if you want the better telling of this story, go rent the original 1974 movie with Burt Reynolds.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dumb, but goofily entertaining, disaster flick"></head><body><p>Let's make one thing absolutely clear here: you do not go to see a movie like "The Core" expecting to see high level film-making like "The Godfather" or "Citizen Kane".  Heck, you don't even go expecting to see something on the level of "Enemy of the State" or "Crimson Tide".  A movie like "The Core" falls firmly in that campy genre known as the 'disaster' film.  Hollywood became enamored with and perfected the formula for the disaster film in the early 1970's, with such movies like the "Airport" series, "Poseidon Adventure", "The Swarm", and just about any film involving George Kennedy.  The past decade has shown a resurgence in this genre with "Twister" in the 1996, the dueling 'volcano' movies in 1997, and the dueling 'asteroid hits the Earth' movies in 1998.  "The Core" is just the latest in a long line of movies to fill that genre.<br /><br />"The Core" comes complete with all the elements that make a disaster film work.  It has the hammy, over-the-top acting.  It has the cheesy, yet somewhat compelling, special effects.  It has the feeling of impending doom looming over a group of people (or the entire world) if a motley group of heroes can't achieve their goal.  Finally, it is entertaining.  As "The Core" possesses all of these characteristics, there are worse ways to spend two hours and a few bucks than on this movie.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, of "The Core" centers around the impending destruction of the Earth as a result of one of the military's nefarious experiments. It seems there is this project called "Project Destiny" which is designed to create earthquakes anywhere in the world at any time to destroy the U.S.'s enemies. Alas, the experimentation with this project has caused the Earth's core to stop rotating. As a result, the magnetic field around the planet that protects the us from the Sun's harmful rays is slowly disappearing, leading to the eventual 'roasting' of the entire planet. Of course, there's a desperate plan that can save the planet before the final disaster strikes. It seems that there is a reclusive scientist who has developed a material that withstand the pressures and heat of the interior of the Earth. The material is called, of course, "Unobtanium", which is a science-fiction parlance for any material that is needed to have magical properties that allow the plot to progress. In this case, a ship is built from this material with the goal of going to the center of the early and setting off nuclear bombs to 'restart' the core.<br /><br />The plot sounds pretty preposterous, and it is. Also, don't try to develop an understanding of real science based on this movie. The motley group assigned to go on this mission is your typical band of stereotypical movie types. The actors chew scenery faster than the ship chews up earth. Yet, there is no denying the fact that this movie is fun to watch. No matter how ludicrous the premise, bad the acting or flimsy the plot, any film that you can come out of and say "That was a fun movie" is worthy of a recommendation. "The Core" is one of those kinds of movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Acting Works Well..."></head><body><p>With The Happening, M Night Shyamalan straddles the line between B-movie (the trees are attacking!) psychological drama (there's something happening in the wind!) and a theatrical play, and how one enjoys this film will depend on how you view those nuances.  All the reviews here are accurate and they reflect one's own expectations.  You will either love, hate, or feel that this is a bland production.  Knowing that it was M. Night - a director who marches to his own beat - I had no expectations for anything big.<br /><br />Trademark to M. Night's style is realism. He does not rely on wham-bam special effects to amp up the action, hence the characters are key to holding the whole story together.  Mark Wahlberg, John Leguizamo, and Zooey Deschanel put in compelling, empathic performances as the people who are trapped in a situation they don't understand.<br /><br />(The closest parallel to The Happening would probably be Spielberg's War of the Worlds, minus the special effects and set in a small town.)<br /><br />I hadn't seen an M. Night film since the Village, but his style hasn't changed one bit.  So if you saw that, and you watched Unbreakable, well, this is in the same vein.  His characters remain mysterious and intriguing, while his story arcs need work. M. Night isn't one for a big climactic reveal either.<br /><br />So, while THE HAPPENING is average as a thriller, it actually succeeds in being depressing and disturbing for a mix of reasons - there's no solution in sight and people are powerless in this lifetime to do anything.  While touching perhaps on an existential chord but not quite pressing all the right buttons, Mr Shyamalan needs to work harder at his storytelling somewhere (Robert Mckee of Story fame would attest to that).<br /><br />He continues to be a quirky auteur in Hollywood genres, but many like me are how long he's going to last with his brand of moviemaking.  He continues to defy the formula, and I can't help feeling he really wants to be more distinct like Director Nicholas Roeg ("Don't Look Now") or Canadian director Atom Egoyan.<br /><br />His character driven pieces seem to suit a smaller medium like TV better, and he should really be directing episodes of the Twilight Zone if that series was ever revived.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jack Black Provides Some Very Silly But Very Funny Physical Comedy"></head><body><p>MOVIE: When I heard that Jack Black would be playing a Mexican Friar who moonlighted as a wrestler in Jared Hess' next project I got very happy, because I knew this would be a funny movie. The trailers for the film advertised exactly what this movie was, and that was pure physical comedy. The story is about Nacho, a Friar who wants the fame and fortune that is associated with being a luchadore after living the same old life over and over each day. He then realizes that this journey to become a professional wrestler is not for himself but for the orphans whom he looks after and cooks for at the orphanage. The movie is basically Jack Black running around with his shirt off for an hour and a half while sporting a fake mustache and a funny Mexican accent. While the majority of the comedy in the film is physical, there are some hilarious lines in the film that are delivered with the right spunk by Black. There are also some great physical scenes in and outside the ring that shows just how great of a physical comedian Black is. The movie is incredibly stupid, but it's also so very funny. If you enjoy pure silly comedy executed perfectly then this movie is just the thing you need. Don't expect another Napoleon Dynamite because this is not a reincarnation of Hess' previous cult hit. He uses the same style of shooting the movie though by using a lot of wide symmetrically balanced shots. Personally, I laughed harder at this then I did with Napoleon Dynamite. Napoleon Dynamite had some great one-liners, but Nacho Libre overall is just plain silly fun. Don't take the film seriously at all, just sit back and laugh.<br /><br />ACTING: This is clearly a one man show, and it's been advertised like that. Jack Black is in every scene of the movie, and he's funny pretty much in every scene. His facial expressions and ability to jump around remind me a lot of Chris Farley. He is incredibly hilarious as Nacho and he gets some great support from Hector Jimenez who plays his sidekick, Esqueleto (directly translates to Skeleton). In fact there are few names in the film that directly translate to funny names in English. I recall one boy's name as Chancho, which means filthy. So, you can basically get the tone of the movie just by the characters' names.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Lots of fun and lots of physical comedy that takes the right tone so that it is in fact funny in a stupid way. Usually movies like this fall flat and just end up stupid, but the ingrediants were right on this one and I found Nacho Libre pleasently entertaining. I also found the funniest line of the movie to be "get that corn outta my face!"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Boring Biopic!!!!"></head><body><p>I'd just as soon watched paint dry than see this movie again!!  It was horribly slow!!<br /><br />I enjoy Johnny Cash's music. I also enjoy Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon's acting abilities and felt they both gave great performances in this Johnny Cash Biopic, but felt the screenplay and narrow focus of Mr. Cash's life made the film unbearable.<br /><br />The movie did a complete overkill of Cash's alcohol and drug addiction, overkill on the poor relationship Cash had with his father and need for his father's approval, and overkill on his hot pursuit of June Carter. I think it would have been nice to incorporate other aspects of his life too.</p></body></html>

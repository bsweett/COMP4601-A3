<meta name="summary" content="Better "what is reality?" concept than The Matrix"></head><body><p>I saw this movie in the box office and it blew me away. The noir look and feel of the movie. The sinister strangers that pop up. The fact that the plot unfolds in front of you gradually in this film. Alex Proyas made a winner in this movie.<br /><br />This movie really plays with the whole concept of what you think is really actually isn't. It does so by allowing you to realize this as John Murdock, the main character, does. Pieces don't make sense at first and then fall into place later. In my opinion this is a superior form of telling that concept then how it was done on The Matrix, where the concept of reality not being reality is practically spoon fed to you (Don't get me wrong. I really like The Matrix. I just see this one aspect as limiting compared to Dark City). This is where Dark City shines.<br /><br />The acting is superb all around. The special effects are very impressive for its time, especially with the budget they had to work with. The script is unique and very well laid out.  All in all this is an excelling science fiction film that plays out like a mystery and holds onto you until the finish.<br /><br />The DVD might not have nearly as many bonus features as the ones you see these days, but when I got this DVD back when it was released it seemed feature-rich. The big bonus feature back then was the director's commentary and it's still the sign of a good special edition. Alex and the production team go into some real fine detail on the movie which makes the commentary that much more special. You also get a commentary from Roger Ebert that feels more like an analysis, but is actually a good analysis.<br /><br />Other features include actor profiles, a review comparison between Dark City and the silent movie Metropolis (Roger Ebert seems to find many parallels between the two), and a game called Return to Shell Beach (which I never really figured out or cared to as it meant disrupting the movie while playing it).<br /><br />Considering the price tag on this DVD now it would be a crime NOT to get it. The movie is excellent. Believe me. If you're a sci-fi fan you don't want to miss this one.</p></body></html>

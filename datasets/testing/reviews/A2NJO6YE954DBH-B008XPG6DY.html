<meta name="summary" content="One bad move can derail your life.  So what will two or more do to it?"></head><body><p>It was ironic that we watched "Derailed" tonight because we saw "Inside Man" this afternoon.  One is a Clive Owen movie where we could never figure out what was really going on and the other was one where things clicked into place early on and we were getting tired for the hero to catch up.  To be clear, Derailed" is the second movie.  It is not that this movie is predictable in terms of the action, but that the twist is rather obvious (so obvious that I was wondering if it was a red herring, but, no, it was not).  However, once Owen's character finally gets the big clue, this movie gets fairly interesting and actually end up redeeming itself more than I thought it would.<br /><br />All I remembered about this movie was the bit from the trailer about Owen betting Jennifer Aniston that he can kiss her without touching her lips.  So when I started to watch it I really had no clue what it was going to be about.  When we meet Charles Schine (Owen), he is having a bad time across the board.  His daughter, Amy (Addison Timlin) has the worst type of diabetes; her third kidney transplant has failed and her only hope is a drug the FDA has yet to approve.  At work he has lost a big account.  To top things off, when Charles gets on the commuter train he discovers his wife has borrowed money from his wallet and he cannot pay the $9 fare.  A beautiful woman, Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), pays for his ticket, and he goes from checking out her gams to engaging her in conversation on a train, in a bar (for the bet), and eventually in hotel room.<br /><br />Then something bad happens.<br /><br />If you do not know what the bad thing is you will be able to survive this review with your innocence intact (but if you watch the trailer on the DVD, forget about it).  Charles has to deal with the consequences of what happens and having made one bad decision he has to choose to keep making additional mistakes.  Now, for the sake of this argument forget about the film's obvious twist and just look at the situation from his perspective.  I insist there comes a point where the madness clearly stops because we are in that territory where a father would rather be dead then do what Charles does.  At that point I was extremely unforgiving of the character, screenwriter Stuart Beattie ("Collateral"), director Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m ("Leva livet"), and was thinking I might have to check out the original novel to see how culpable James Siegel was in all this.<br /><br />However, then we get to the part of the film where Charles goes from playing defense to going on the offense.  My immediate thought was that this was going to be too little, too late, but I was rather surprised.  What I appreciated was that Charles continues to make mistakes, so there is no sudden transformation from sinner to saint.  I also like the fact that this film recognizes that Charles is playing with such unclean hands that he does not deserve to walk away without paying a price.  By the time this one is over I was actually thinking that we were supposed to figure out the twist, because it is part of the set up for how the endgame plays out, because a lot of what happens is really playing with out expectations.  By definition, that is what a thriller is supposed to do.<br /><br />Final aside: It would be interesting to see this story played out from the aftermath of the bad thing without either the twist or the continuing series of bad things that happen.  It would not longer be a thriller, but it would still be a compelling story played out with these characters.  Certainly there was enough for Charles and Lucinda to live with at that point.</p></body></html>

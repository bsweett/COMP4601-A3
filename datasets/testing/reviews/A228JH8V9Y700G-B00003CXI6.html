I've always enjoyed Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, but wondered what this movie was all about.  I was pleasently surprised, as it was far better than I thought it would be, and I didn't anticipate the twists and turns.<br /><br />Harrison and Michelle play Norman and Claire Spencer, a happily married couple who are adjusting to their new positions in life.  Their daughter has just gone off to college, and they are now pseudo empty nesters.  While Norman still has his work as a college professor, Claire finds herself a bit bored.  Their new next door neighbors have become an object of fascination, as they have passionate fights and reconciliation.  Clarie eventually becomes convinced that the husband murdered his wife when she sees some strange things in the middle of the night.  After attempting to contact spirits on the Ouija board and some odd goings on here and there, Claire becomes convinced that the wife's ghost is trying to communicate with her.  When she confronts the neighbor, he explains, once his wife appears at his side, that he didn't kill his wife.  Embarrassed, Claire leaves with her tail between her legs, thinking it's just some paranoid fantasy.<br /><br />But there really is a spirit trying to connect with her, just one not in association with the neighbors.  It's of a university student who disappeared last year named Madison.  Who Norman had an affair with.  Who Claire walked in on, ran away in shock, had a car accident, bumped her head, and forgot about.<br /><br />It's a juicy tale, to be sure.  It's a good, old school kind of thriller, without blood and guts, and keeps the suspense going until the very end.  A good movie to rent some night when you want some lite entertainment and a little horror mixed in.</p></body></html>

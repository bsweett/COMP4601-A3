<meta name="summary" content="Why so much violence?"></head><body><p>What's with Mel Gibson and all these violent movies? Does he try to top himself each time? Take away the violence and how many people would really go to see this movie? Seriously? Better yet, take away Mel Gibson's name and how many people would go to see this movie? I'm hoping, one day, he'll make a movie that normal people can enjoy.</p></body></html>

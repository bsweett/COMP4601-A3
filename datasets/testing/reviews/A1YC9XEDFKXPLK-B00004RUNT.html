<meta name="summary" content="Technical &amp; Entertainment Value rate a Perfect 5 !"></head><body><p>First off, this dvd should be the reference standard to demonstrate the powers that be concerning the excellence in dvd picture and sound quality for this home video medium format!The colors are rich and daylight bright(you will be marvelling at LeeLoo's beautiful crystal blue eyes and bright burning orange hair)The images are crystal sharp and finely focused (and, yes I have seen this dvd played on several different makes and models of players and t.v.s; so, it's not just the hardware being used). The dialogue, surround sound effects, and music went beyond my expectations!<p>Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman are perfectly cast. The appearance of Chris Tucker is a memorable one.The gender bending/rock-star/d.j. celebrity character Ruby Rhod is a sheer tongue-in-cheek joke throwing it's innuendos at another well known &quot;Purple&quot;reigning musical artist in real life!<p>What's not to love about this movie ?There are good guys, bad guys, state-of-the-art special f/x, excellent music, and eye catching(yet sometimes confusing) sets/sceneries.The story or plot may not be profound but the rest of the above mentioned carry it off very well indeed...<p>P.S.--I highly recommend the soundtrack. The only error is that the chase scene,between Corben Dallas and the police,containing the salsa-ethnic sounding track sung in Arabic or Middle-Eastern vocals has been omitted !</p></body></html>

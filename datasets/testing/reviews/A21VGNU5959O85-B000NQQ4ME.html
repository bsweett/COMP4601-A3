There are films that you see that you just KNOW it's a window into the soul of the writer or director, and you are grateful they had the guts to do it. Mel Gibson has always taken his fervor, vivacity, creativity and devotion to his work seriously. He has produced and directed such films as: Man without a Face, Forever Young, Braveheart, Passion of the Christ, and Apocalypto. All of those films have personally left me with a sense of wonderment, curiosity, awe and self awareness. Mel, as we know, has issues but unlike some people he admits it and is getting help (sober for 3 months!). I grew up with an alcoholic, so I know the ups and downs and the inner turmoil they feel, we are lucky as an audience to witness Mel's way of hashing out his inner demons. I personally don't know one person on the face of the earth who can judge Mel, we all have had moments or knew someone who did, and we all deserve forgiveness and understanding.<br /><br />Onto the review<br /><br />  Apocalypto is an astonishing, breathtaking tale of one man and his devotion to both his family, and his way of life. Jaguar Paw is everyman. A father, husband, son, and warrior.<br /><br />Who among us could imagine his way of life and the hard work it takes to provide for a village and family, and who among us wouldn't trade all we have to experience that sense of accomplishment and utter bliss. When he sees another warrior, who has been displaced by an unknown ravager, he senses his fear and it worries him. His own father says to him that once fear sets into your brain it takes over, and you can't let that happen. That is the truth; a lot of us live with some kind of fear and it consumes our lives to the point where any happiness we feel is fleeting. Jaguar Paw sleeps in a hut, but has a beautiful family and he is content. When a tribe of warriors comes to desecrate their village and kidnap the men and women, he experiences great loss and feels the fear his father spoke of envelope his whole being. He saves his family, only to leave them in a precarious position and he knows that he has to get back to them somehow.<br /><br />  The evil in this movie turns out to be a city of excess populated by the sick and the depraved and the greedy. A ruler who wants bigger buildings, who demands human sacrifice to satiate the Gods, and in turn their crops will grow again and the diseased will be healed. It's a town where human waste runs through the streets, and the people are idle and do nothing but sit around and use the resources, and where the value of a human life is an afterthought to the sport of the game and wicked morbid amusement. It is a society that is doomed and we all know it as soon as we see it through Jaguar Paws eyes. Gibson clearly is saying here that a great civilization cannot not exist on such wastefulness of youth, resources, and decadence.<br /><br />  Jaguar Paw has a mission to get back to his family and because of circumstances and sheer willpower gets free and starts heading back to them, followed by the same warriors who kidnapped him. They are weary of him because of some prophecy but decide to still go after him because of revenge and pride.  He is wounded but manages to outwit, outlast and draw upon strength of character that none of them have. He is a man while they are merely semblances of men parading around in finery, their brains empty and hearts full of hate and greed. In the end he succeeds in saving his family, and witnesses the coming of a new enemy with the Spaniards landing on their beach. Instead of investigating the newcomers he vanishes into the jungle determined to start over anew, a spark of independence and preservation for his way of life still alight.<br /><br />  My husband and I left the theater and talked for about two hours about what message we got from Apocalypto. Why can't people be happy with what they have? Are we as a society now dependent on too much technology and not enough on the skills it takes to survive without. Is the family unit a thing of the past, Are we all too wasteful and ignoring the lessons of many civilizations that have gone before? Do we let fear rule our lives, the fear of bills and jobs and traffic and gossip. Do we know our priorities in life, and is the number one thing ourselves? Are we too selfish, do we have a tribe we can depend on? Do we listen to our elders?<br /><br />I would tell anyone to see this movie, over the age of 17 of course, it does have violence but not for the sake of shock. I thought CSI shows worse that this movie did! Go see it even if you hate Mel Gibson, because your basically just shooting yourself in the foot boycotting his movies.</p></body></html>

Johnny Cash appears one-dimensional, and the story kept jumping from one incident to another.  If they kept a bit of continuity, (like showing how he gained acceptance in his field rather than cut from him making his first record in a country store to being a spectacularly famous singer with a spectacular following) it would more cogent and more enjoyable.<br /><br />I remember Johnny and June Cash as people with more substance than this movie shows.  The movie was a poor attempt to capitalize on the memories of these two performers who are still in the minds of much of their public.</p></body></html>

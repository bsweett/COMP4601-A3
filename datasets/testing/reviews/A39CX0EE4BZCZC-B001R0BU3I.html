<meta name="summary" content="Entertraining Thriller With Some Brains"></head><body><p>This was an excellent movie, a very intriguing and topical story involving terrorism with the basic message that there are good and bad people everywhere, of all races, religions, sects, whatever.  The question in this film, for at least half of the movie, is: "Is Samir (Don Cheadle) a good guy or a bad guy?"<br /><br />I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling anything because that could easily be done while discussing this film. Suffice to say that this will keep your interest for the full running time and is a thinking person's movie more than most.<br /><br />Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Neal McDonough, Said Taghmaoui and Alyy Kahn are all fantastic in the lead roles. The direction and photography also is top-notch.  Those who pick apart this movie nit-picking because it's a very entertaining film while not overdoing the action or the stereotypical characters.  One thing that's odd about this film: it has very strong statements which will please both liberals and conservatives, both devoutly religious folks and atheists.  It pretty much covers the field.</p></body></html>

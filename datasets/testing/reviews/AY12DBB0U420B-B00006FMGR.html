<meta name="summary" content="What is Rap Like At Street Level? Brace Yourself And Enjoy."></head><body><p>The bargain-basement movie for last night was "8 Mile" staring Eminem. Well, I've never particularly cared for Rap music or it's Hip-Hop cousin. I don't mean to condemn the entire genre because I can enjoy a bit of it now and then and Eminem would rank as one of my favorite artists within that genre. After all, that's why I bought the DVD. But rap music just doesn't fit me. I'm more of a small town westerner than a big city ghetto dweller. Okay, okay, it has wider appeal, but there's a lot of people who just don't  care for it and I can understand their feelings.<br /><br />"8 mile"was an interesting movie in several different ways. Well, you've all heard of Detroit and several other big cities that are decaying with the demise of American manufacturing. Detroit is a particularly good example because of the dramatic changes in the automobile industry. It's lost 50% of it's population! Only a few decades ago, Detroit was one of America's great cities. Would you like to see Detroit at the ground level and on the mean streets? Well, viewing this movie is a way to do it. The urban decay is just appalling and serves as some kind of warning to all of us, if only we could read it.<br /><br />Rap music came in about in the late 70s. I expected it to be a short-term fad that would fade after a few years, but I was dead wrong. Rap is still with us 35 years later and is still going strong. Where did it come from? What is it like at the real base level? What's it like at a street level rap performance? Well, this movie provides a lot of views for these type of questions. Rap came out of the big city ghettos where most of the inhabitants were African American. It came out of the F-bomb dialect of American English and is harsh and grating on the ears. It's a brash and bombastic music that aggressively pushes itself into your face. Want to know what rap is like at the street level? "8 mile" is a fairly good depiction, I would guess. Well, who am I to say, standing on the distant sidelines?<br /><br />In any case, Eminem is a white Rapper from the Detroit area and he plays a white Rapper from the Detroit area working himself into the distant dream of gaining a recording contract. The movie documents his living conditions and rise through his associates on his way to ultimate stardom. Very interesting! Without question! Brace yourself for harsh conditions and extreme language abuse and you might even enjoy it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

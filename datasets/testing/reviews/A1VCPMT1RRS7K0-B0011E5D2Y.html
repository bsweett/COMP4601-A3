<meta name="summary" content=""Grief is nature's most powerful aphrodisiac" - Chaz Reingold"></head><body><p>Somehow, I allowed myself to miss this movie when it was in theaters.  I finally got to see the "Uncorked Edition" on DVD - I got what I figured I had missed out on... this movie is hilarious.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are great together and they play off of one another classically.  From the opening scene, to the wedding crashing montage, to the ultimate wedding crashing experience at the home of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), these two keep the laughs going.  Vince Vaughn paces the scenes with his rapid-fire fast-wittedness - and Owen Wilson is right there with him.<br /><br />I thought Christopher Walken would have had a funnier part to play and more to contribute.  He is certainly capable of delivering, had he been called on to do so, yet he was good in the role and did what he could with what he was granted.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher play the two interests of our main characters.  Fisher plays a sex-crazed stalker-type and McAdams plays the sweet, reserved one.  They both play solid supporting roles, but I feel the best supporting role was perhaps one of the smallest: Will Ferrell, in his guest spot, steals the show toward the end of the movie...<br /><br />Bonus featured include a very funny commentary by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, deleted scenes, a few good featurettes, a music video and trailers.  You most certainly get your moneys' worth with this DVD.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

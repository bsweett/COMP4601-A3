<meta name="summary" content="GRUESOME-BUT SO WHAT"></head><body><p>After my second watching of the film I realized what was wrong. No purpose, nothing to think about. The apocalyptic aura wasn't there. Questions of interest were missing; how many outposts of survival are there?, do we still not know the cause?, is their any government left and what are they doing?, any militery anywhere? Etc.<br /><br />  The new zombie makeup was good at times but it looked too strained(figure that out). I understand the zombies have somewhat "evolved" but many of them moved too much like the living(even in gesture and emotion)to work for me. It's not a good idea at all to have a zombie acurately firing a gun of any kind. Big Daddy did nothing for me, because even in a far fetched zombie movietheir has to be some creepy believability. His makeup did not look real. Some totally decrepit zombies looked very mechanical(like a Halloween decoration). Sometimes the acting was decent, but wheres the interesting dialogue?. Regarding the plot, I think Romero got too caught up in trying to interject the Bush administration parallel(as he stated it was about)that he lost an opportunity at a better storyline. Every time I heard someone say," Get Dead Reckoning, I need Dead Reckoning" or something to that effect, I'd think that sounds so scripted.<br /><br />  I know pureists think it is sacreligious to say Dawn of the Dead 2004 was a better movie(which is beyond closeminded), but it was (except you don't have to be bit to become a zombie, just die). It was definetly filmed better. Romero created some moments in Land of the Dead(which is a terrible title) but you need more than gore to get an exciting and pondering horror flick. On this kind of movie, I can't go any deeper then that.</p></body></html>

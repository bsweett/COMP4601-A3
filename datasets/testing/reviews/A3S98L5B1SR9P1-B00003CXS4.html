The cast should speak for itself. If you have never seen this movie or "Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels", you need to get off line and rent or buy them now. I could not possibly begin to describe the quality of this film. Vinny Jones and Brad Pitt have a couple of the funniest lines that I have ever heard in any film. There are two many great actors and small stories that lead into one grand finish.</p></body></html>

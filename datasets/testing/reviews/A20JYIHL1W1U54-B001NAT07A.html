Though Catwoman is a normal human being her talents definitely push the envelope. Unfortunately this movie suffered bad press and suffered dearly at the box office. I enjoyed it. The computer-generated effects were believable. I find that to be a big plus in movies of this genre. I liked this one. A real sleeper hit.</p></body></html>

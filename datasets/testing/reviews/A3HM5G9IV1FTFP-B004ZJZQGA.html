<meta name="summary" content="Morality tale"></head><body><p>This morality tale is kept afloat by Colin Farrell's performance. The story of two hit men temporarily staying in Bruges after a botched job in which a child was inadvertently killed is really dark and sad, but Farrell brings a charm and comic touch to his character that keeps the film from being too depressing. His character maintains a strange innocence so that even when doing terrible things, the audience can continue to find him sympathetic. Playing the perfect yang to Farrell's yin is Ralph Fiennes, who plays the hitmen's unrepentant, psychotic boss.<br /><br />Ultimately, the film asks whether it's possible to escape the consequences and find redemption after doing something horrible. The answers appear to be no and maybe.</p></body></html>

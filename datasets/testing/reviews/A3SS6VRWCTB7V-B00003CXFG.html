<meta name="summary" content="Great science fiction film and plenty of action, effects."></head><body><p>Interesting film with decent enough plot, characters, action, dialogue, effects. Lots of people have never heard of this film but it is worth a look if you like SYFY and or action. Riddick as the main character, sort of, is an interesting character, who you are not sure you like or hate. Recommend. Actually like this one better than "follow on" Chronicles of Riddick.</p></body></html>

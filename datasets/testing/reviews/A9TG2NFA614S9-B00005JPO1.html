<meta name="summary" content="A Franchise that Could Go On Forever"></head><body><p>This Indiana Jones movie has some long, wild car chases, incredible switches from vehicle to vehicle, some very funny gags by Harrison Ford, a reunion with an old impregnated flame, nostalgic views of old cars, and a mild feeling that the film could have been better.<br /> Ford is trapped in quicksand about to go under; his only escape is to grab hold of a thick black snake and be pulled out. His savior yells, "Grab the snake." Ford, panicky at the sight of the fearful reptile, cries out, "Don't call it a snake. Call it a rope." When he and his entourage is about to go over an enormous waterfall, he hears the group's madman (John Hurt) say, "Three." Ford says, "Three what?" and then he realizes that they are going to go over three horrific waterfalls, each one worse than the preceding one.<br /> Sit back, relax, and enjoy the flick. It can be a lot of fun because of the tongue in cheek style. Ford is good in the part; he's had enough practice to perfect the role. There's lots of hokey stuff, but it's still better than a lot of the other dross around.</p></body></html>

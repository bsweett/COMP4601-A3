<meta name="summary" content="HISTORIC NIGHTMARE"></head><body><p>It was much to bear to watch the eleven Israeli athletes of the 1972 Olympic Games slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists, just as they had primed their young bodies and minds to a state of physical strength and endurance in Stephen Spielberg's, "Munich", but the carnage doesn't stop there, and if you brace yourself for the awful scenes of the athlete's assassinations, you still have to endure the slow death walk and gurgling bleed of a half naked enemy spy prostitute, and other agonizing deaths which possess a morbid fascination, the kind teenagers in the horror flick audience would find, "cool", and "awesome". It's often a Night of The Very Nearly Living Dead, as gunshot victims momentarily carry out their final acts, as if unaware of bullet holes through their foreheads and chests, until blood protrudes from them like ketchup released from a stuck bottle. Why this fascination with gore, is beyond me. Maybe it serves as companion to the horrific details of the film's inspiration, suggesting the expectations and perpetual motion of the Istraeli athletes were snuffed like a spent Olympian torch.<br /><br />It's a difficult film, given it's "inspired by true events" lead-in. With a free hand to examine the Munich execututions, Spielberg delivers an assured sense of actuality in depicting the State of Israel, seeking revenge against, as opposed to overwhelming, terrorism, and in finding the revenge seeking, justice fighters greatly outclassed in the world of high end spies and assassins. Their secret mission is exposed a number of times due to emotion level tactics, they fall prey to an obvious, seductive counter-assassin, they harbor a mole, and offer outragous sums of money to contacts for information. They mostly 'get their man', so to speak, but we could have told them the cost of terrorism is more terrorism.<br /><br />Without the historic events, "Munich" would make a fantastic espionage thriller. In detailing the history with a flair for the sensational, Spielberg has given us a cloudy, but forceful impression of the Munich assassinatiions, leaving us with the suggestion that all is not well in the course of history. As The World Trade Center towers in the New York City skyline via trick photography near film's end, Spielberg tells us, history will repeat itself. His film's main objective is the conclusion that America did not do enough to support Israel's sense of justice regarding the Munich assassinations.<br /><br />Anyway you look at it, it's a film that shouldn't be missed.</p></body></html>

So it is clearly worthwhile to experience both. In this case, the movie should probably come first, so as to give the reader some visual images to help in understanding the book.<br /><br />Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is an expert in symbols, and specifically in historical symbols. His name was on the appointment book of the murdered curator of the Louvre, and the police naturally come looking for him to explain the symbolism associated with the body. In fact, the body was laid out on the floor of the grand gallery in imitation of the Vetruvian Man, one of DaVinci's most famous drawings. While Langdon is able to explain some things to the police, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) shows up. She is a cryptologist for the police department, and so the policemen on the case believe her when she says the department sent her there. She says she comes with an urgent message for Langdon from the American embassy.<br /><br />But as we quickly learn in this movie, nothing and no one is what it seems, people lie and misdirect and do enigmatic things so fast and confusingly that all the audience can say is well, it will make sense later on. And credit to both author Dan Brown and director Ron Howard, they do. No significant loose ends remain at the end of the film except one: the answer to the question "What will Sophie do now?" You have to get there to understand how significant that question is.<br /><br />The heart of the story is some history which can be interpreted in different ways, and some archeology, and more than a little speculation. There has long been a suggestion that the Holy Grail is not a chalice used at the Last Supper, but something more secret. And it is true that no single chalice is in front of Jesus in the DaVinci painting of the last supper. Instead, each place is set with a small and rather ordinary cup. And all the things said about that painting and about the Mona Lisa are true and can be verified by checking any decent reproduction of these extremely famous paintings. The interpretations are not all Dan Brown's, either, but collected from a variety of sources.<br /><br />So if you want to discover exactly how much truth is in the story (which is admittedly fiction), one thing you will need to do is look closely at those two paintings, at least in good copies. Another would be to research the truth of various architectural gems which are referenced in the story, although Brown states at the outset that they are true. Certainly just taking his word for it is not good enough. The church history he expounds would also have to be examined closely for the truth of many assertions.<br /><br />I've not done that, nor have I examined the various conflicting claims as to what is or is not true which have been done by others, at least not in any great detail. But then I don't have a problem with saying that it may or may not be true and leaving it at that. The ability to suspend judgment is a useful art. "Maybe" is a very, very useful word. Keep it in mind as you explore this story.</p></body></html>

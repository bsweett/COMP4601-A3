<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing, as it was Meant to be"></head><body><p>Well, it's pretty violent and about every third word starts with F, but it's an important story, and based on a true story. I'm a sucker for movies based on true stories.<br /><br />Derek Vinyard is a hate-filled white supremicist, a skinhead with a huge swastika tattooed on his chest. One night he's banging his girlfriend when his younger brother Danny notices the sound of someone breaking into Derek's truck. He looks out his bedroom window and there's a black guy trying to rip off the truck. He interrupts Derek's activities to tell him, and Derek goes out in his underwear with his semi-automatic weapon and guns down the thief and one accomplice. One of them is not dead, and raises his arm begging for mercy. The audience does not see until later how Derek responded.<br /><br />But Danny saw. Danny idolized his older brother and shaved his head, too. He also had several tattoos. Most of the story is told in flash-backs from the day Derek is released from prison and comes back to his largely dysfunctional family.<br /><br />Derek changed while he was in the prison at Chino, and I was just glad that the credit was not given to religion. Instead, his English teacher (later principal of the school when Danny is there) is the one who deserves some of the credit. I'm not going to tell you who else gets the credit for turning Derek into a decent fellow.<br /><br />When Danny turned in a history paper all about Adolf Hitler, his teacher (who used to date his mother) goes to the principal and wants him thrown out. The principal is not prepared to give up on Danny, and tells him that from now on he will be Danny's history teacher. They will call the class American History X, and Danny's first assignment is to write an essay all about his brother and his influence on him and on the community.<br /><br />Not gonna tell you any more. You just have to see it develop. Grit your teeth about the language and the violence; it's about some hard issues that are very real.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A SOLID REMAKE 9 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>This remake of the 1978 classic Dawn of the Dead is awesome. The gore factor has been kicked up a notch, there are more characters, more action, more terrifying zombies, and the vibe is even creepier. The storyline is still vague however, because it's still about how there is no more room in hell and now the dead walk the earth. Plus, it doesn't feel like it has all the finesse of the creepy vibe of the original. Still it's one of the most solid remakes of any movie you can find. If you can't get enough of zombies you must buy this movie.</p></body></html>

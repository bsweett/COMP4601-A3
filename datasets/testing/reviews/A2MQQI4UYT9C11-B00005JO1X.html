<meta name="summary" content="Please save beautiful young actress from heavy-handed film"></head><body><p>My daughter and I went to Narnia (cinematically speaking) at the theatre. Not having been a youthful (or otherwise) reader of the books, I can't judge the film from that perspective, but I agree that Lucy was perfect--what a wonderful young actress.<br /><br />With all the discussion about the story being a Christian fable, it was pretty easy to predict the plot. The many reminders I saw from other movies and stories made me sense how interwoven the world of children's stories is--C.S. Lewis doesn't owe anything to the Lion King, but Disney owed a lot of Mustafa to Lewis and Aslan. I half expected Aslan to explain the Circle of Life to the children. The beginning reminded me a lot of Lemony Snicket.<br /><br />I spotted one glitch regarding Father Christmas, or whoever the gift-bearing gentleman was. Later in the movie one of the children refers to the "man in the red suit"--as we remembered the scene, the man was dressed in brown, not red.<br /><br />Overall, Narnia was a two-star movie for me--too dominated by computer-generated special effects, and too heavy-handed in the triumph-of-good-over-evil story. My daughter, also not a student of the book, liked it better and said she might try to read the book.</p></body></html>

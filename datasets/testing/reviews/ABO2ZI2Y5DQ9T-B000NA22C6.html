<meta name="summary" content="'You Stole My Story': Johnny Depp in Decent Thriller"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp and John Turturro are in the filmed version of Stephen King novella, directed by prolific screenwriter David Koepp ('Panic Room' and many, many others).  The unexpected combination of them delivers to a certain degree -- like 3.5 points out of 5 -- but can never really deceive the eye of the viewers who have seen this type of thriller before.<br /><br />In fact, the greatest part of 'Secret Window' is Johnny Depp's skilled acting as popular writer named Rainey.  One day, while he is living in a remote woodland cabin, trying to write something, a spooky-looking guy with a heavy accent knocks the door, claiming 'You stole my story.'  When this guy, a Mr. Shooter, is played by excellent John Turturro, you know this guy can be very creepy.  And to us avid movie fans, his mannerism is very interesting to see.<br /><br />But things get worse when Rainey doesn't take him seriously, for apparently this creepy guy's intention seems more than you can take care of, acting like a stalker.  And Rainey has another thing to take care of, like the divorce with his  wife (Maria Bello), or still-ongoing enmity with her new boy-friend (Timothy Hutton).  And the private detective (Charles S. Dutton) is not helpful very much.<br /><br />The film tries to make the story more and more intense as it goes on, driving the character of Rainey into the metally confusing zone.  But what is most regrettable is, like I said before, everything looks utterly signposted for the viewers accustomed to this genre.  In the first place, the script lacks the central theme that should attract us -- if someone claims you stole a story, all you should do is easy: call your laywer, or disprove the claim by showing the proof, while Rainey is very, very slow to do this.  Moreover, the ending (which is not pleasant to see, I am afraid) wants to be a big surprise while WE KNOW there's gonna be a big surprise, which means, it is not.  In fact, the opening camera that quietly introduces us to the protagonist lying on the couch (and the camera moves into the reflection of the mirror, and stays in there) is more impressive than the flat ending itself.<br /><br />Still Johnny Depp is an actor not to be missed, and Turturro too, and Depp's quirky performance (with many detailed small actions) is very entertaining in its own way.  Though Philip Glass's name gives 'class' to this Stephen King film, it is Depp who virtually raised the production a few notches higher than other films based on King.<br /><br />Enjoy the film as it is; it's a so-so thriller and nothing but that.  But as to Depp's acting, it's another matter.</p></body></html>

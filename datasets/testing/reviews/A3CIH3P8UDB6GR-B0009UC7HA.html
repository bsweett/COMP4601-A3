I like Matthew (especially in TIME TO KILL) and Penelope is ok, attractive but her acting wasn't the best (kinda like her in Gothika even though it was a short role), but then again overall it was a comedy action movie.  William H Macy, i like his funny parts in other movies as well.  I bought this on HD and can't wait to watch it!!  The bad guy wasn't convincing, and the storyline was not bad, but as for an overall movie, I would recommend it if say they like Indiana Jones, or some thrill ride. . . .  It's a good movie, and I'm glad to purchase it for my HD DVD COLLECTIONS!  Atleast RENT THIS for a relaxing night!</p></body></html>

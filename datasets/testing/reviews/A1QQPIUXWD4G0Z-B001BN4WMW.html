<meta name="summary" content="Good Directing Debut For Mel Gibson"></head><body><p>Mel Gibson's 1995 Braveheart is an honorable first attempt at directing and acting in the lead role. The movie however has serious historical inaccuracies as to the obscure William Wallace and the Scottish revolt of the 14th century.<br /><br /> The notion that William Wallace was a cultivated man fluent in the classics and Latin is fantasy. By all accounts, William Wallace was a crude patriotic zealot who was discarded by Robert the Bruce and other leading Scottish nobles for his banditry and lack of diplomacy. The most absurd parts of the film are the jingoistic expressions of &quot;Freeeeeedom!!!!&quot; gratuitously interspersed in various scenes to make him seem more like an American freedom fighter. Patrick McGoohan played an excellent role as Edward I although he's portrayed as an unusually cruel ruler which, compared other contemporary monarchs in Medieval Europe, he was not. Another distortion is the portrayal of Princess Isabelle as the poor innocent maiden who is saddened at not receiving the affections of her dandy Prince Edward. It's unfortunate that the film doesn't show how the &quot;innocent&quot; Isabelle had her sexually ungratifying and politically incompetent husband brutally impaled with a white-hot chimney poker shortly after he took the throne as Edward II. Another error is the inquisition-like execution of William Wallace; all historical sources recite William Wallace having been drawn and quartered: his body parts were distributed across the kingdom as an example and his head was kept fixed on a pike in London.<br /><br /> The battle scenes were quite grand but also inaccurate. A common misconception of Scots is that they all wore kilts at every possible occasion which is completely false. The kilt as a military garb was introduced much later in the 18th and 19th centuries by the English with the formation of the Highlander regiments.<br /><br /> If you can ignore the overwhelming anthropological and historical inaccuracies in the film, it is quite pleasant to watch.</p></body></html>

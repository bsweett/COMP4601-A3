Police or guards (guarding what? from what?) are everywhere, in beetle-black armor with opaque beetle helmets. This inhuman environment is filled with people. The question is, are they fully human?<br /><br />This world's answer to war, crime, and violence is to flatten all emotion, in every one, with "Prozium". Our hero, Preston, seeks out the people who skip their doses and dare to feel. It's a capital crime, and he summarily executes the penalty more often than not. One day, his dose breaks on the floor. He is delayed in replacing it, then stops taking it altogether.<br /><br />That, of course, is where the movie really starts. It's also where tinges of color start to appear on screen, as Preston's mind opens to the figurative colors of emotion. This is a very good dystopic story, oddly similar to Brave New World even in its differences, but more like THX 1138. The action isn't as wild as comparisons to The Matrix would suggest, but this movie is a lot more thoughtful. And keep your eye on Preston's children. They are un-nerving throughout the movie, perhaps most of all in the last scene.<br /><br />I like this one a lot. It's got fair action, but it's a lot more than that. For one, it's an uncommonly effective use of the cinematographer's palette. Mostly, though, it starts from a premise that stands up to a little thought - a rarity these days.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

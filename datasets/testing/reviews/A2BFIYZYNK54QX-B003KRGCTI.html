<meta name="summary" content="If not for Denzel and Gary, a "Wholly" unwatchable mess."></head><body><p>For years, I've been waiting for The Hughes Brothers to make a good film... and they just keep letting me down. MENACE II SOCIETY had moments of flair and style, but ultimately was not a good film. DEAD PRESIDENTS is one of the most needlessly violent films I've ever seen, and while I appreciate the point it's trying to make, it doesn't make it well. FROM HELL... well, being a comic fan and a devotee of Alan Moore, this film was simply god-awful. And then I saw the trailer for THE BOOK OF ELI, and I thought to myself... COOL! Denzel as a post-apocalyptic wasteland Zatoichi-esque wanderer and Gary Oldman as his nemesis. That seems like the recipe for a really kick-butt film. But... no. They manage to take a really interesting premise and make it convoluted, cliched, inanimate and ultimately dull. The problems that the two stars of the film face the most is that they've played these roles before, and they've played them better. Denzel did the FAR superior MAN ON FIRE and Gary did the FAR superior LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL.<br /><br />What also upsets me is the way that not just this film, but every film that the great Ray Stevenson seems to be in, his talent is just wasted.<br /><br />The film operates under a similar pretense to another superior film, Kurt Wimmer's EQUILIBRIUM, that certain abstract things (in this case, certain 'books') cause death, destruction and war. And what has caused more death and destruction throughout history than religion? Again, if you've read anything on the description of this film, you know that the book Denzel is carrying with him is the last-known copy of the King James bible. And apparently, this bible is giving him a supernatural ability to resist harm and kick serious tail. Denzel's dialogue consists mainly of how he's "being led by faith" or "being guided by God"... old hat. Gary goes for the quiet insane that has bursts of rage and violence. Old hat. The desolate post-nuclear wastes are shot with highly bleached colors. OLD... HAT. How this film becomes even worse is that Denzel gets a kid sidekick. Well, it's twenty-something hottie Mila Kunis, but she has the emotional range of a twelve-year old, so for all intents and purposes, she's a kid sidekick.<br /><br />And the film, near the end, has an O.Henry-like twist that is so incredibly stupid that I had trouble believing that they included it.<br /><br />Another mess by the formerly-promising Hughes Brothers. They can pretty much count me out. Fool me once, shame on you... fool me FOUR TIMES, to quote Dubya, I won't get fooled again.</p></body></html>

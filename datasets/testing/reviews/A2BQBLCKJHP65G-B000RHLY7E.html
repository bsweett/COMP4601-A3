<meta name="summary" content="The Closest Zombie's Come To A Horror Masterpiece...So Far"></head><body><p>Jeez, where do I begin on this one?<br /><br />Okay, this movie fell through my cracks, mainly due to my<br />personal views on the original "House Of 1000 Corpses" &<br />the fact it's played exclusively on Showtime (I'm an HBO/<br />Cinemax man myself). But every so often I wanted to see<br />this, having high hopes that this would take the unfortunate<br />hokeyness of Corpses and put it in the right direction. I mean,<br />the characters of the Firefly family all have great potential<br />that to me didn't reach it effectively the first time. Would<br />Zombie correct his mistakes being allowed a second time around?<br /><br />Taking place shortly after the Corpses, Devil's Rejects pretty<br />much begins at the Family's downfall by Sheriff Wydell, this time<br />as the brother of the originally slain Wydell from the first film,<br />played by character actor favorite William Forsythe. Forsythe<br />plays the revengeful Sheriff typically over-the-top, and by the<br />time he loses it, you're already well aware it's gonna happen.<br />Escaping the raid is four principal characters: Captain Spaulding,<br />Otis Driftwood, Baby Firefly, and captured Mother Firefly (this<br />time played by Police Academy's Lesile Easterbrook). So when your an on-the-run psychopathic family, what do you do? Go killin' of course! And in typical family psycho tradition they find another group to go torture & humilate in the likes of the Banjo & Sullivan family, a traveling country group who, of course, just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /><br />Without spoiling too much more, you get the principal idea. Look, Rob Zombie is my age, so the guy grew up with the exact horror sexploitation films that I did. There's no doubt this movie is more of a homage to past films like "House On The Edge Of The Park" or "I Spit On Your Grave", just without any victim retaliation. Each character is played still so over the top, you just cannot figure out if Zombie's intent for the film is either parody, straight forward horror, or just plain comedy, and that's my main problem. While some characters grip the right feel (Haig and Moseley do add some true Horror credibility here), other characters like the Mother and especially Sheri Moon's Baby just comes off as annoying. REAL annoying actually, almost making me want to shut off the flix right then and there. But then again, the overall feel is better presented here than in Corpses, but getting to third base instead of first still isn't a homerun to me.<br /><br />I should note that ALL of Zombie's films look great. There is no doubt he is a great director. The look of sets, camera angles, music pieces, and such always hit the mark every time. It's just his writing. Too hokey at times, too much like a cheap copy of the films we grew up. Instead of a better way of telling this genre, he gives you an alternative one, not the same but not better either. That's the same feel I got from his 2007 Halloween too, Looks great, less filling! Also, his casting is always a treat for a Horror fan like myself. Always a group of "Oh, I know that guy/girl from..." list. For instance Priscilla Barnes, of Three's Company fame, plays one of the victims here, and in her big scene it's as if because she was availible to Zombie, he would recreate her humilation from 1979's Delta Fox strip-or-die section. To younger fans it's different, but to me and Zombie's generation it's more like "Yeah, yeah...I remember...". I mean it was cool then Rob, but now........<br /><br />Anyway, I'm glad I got it out of the way, and while I didn't hate the film, I consider it to be Zombie's best picture, even as far as saying it's miles ahead of Corpses and Halloween, it just doesn't hit classic territory still. Maybe if Zombie was born fifteen years earlier and made this in 1978 it would be a classic, but then again if that were the case he wouldn't have all those original films to be "inspired" by now, would he?<br /><br />Worth a rent, but still Zombie needs to put down the pen and<br />concentrate on just the directing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GOT MILK"></head><body><p>Frankly, this movie is a long time coming, it's amazing that an industry full of gays, it has taken this long to get a film made of arguably the most important gay man in American history.  Gus Van Zant does a fantastic job getting a spectacular performance out of the singular Sean Penn and I applaud the man in full disection of Milk.  The film has a nice pace and show's how this mild mannered, East Coast Jew, hardly the sterotype of the stylish, WASP, that most think of when they think of gays, took San Francisco by storm.  I thought Van Zant being gay, really got to the heart of what made Milk tick, and I thought Penn's relationship with Franco in the movie felt genuine, not contrived, like Hanks relationship with Banderas in Philadelphia, though like Hanks and Banderas you wonder, in what gay planet would these people every be together, but I digress.  I especially liked how the film began with a sort of an omage to the gay right's struggle, I just dont think many Americans have a clue about what it is to be gay in this country, nor do many care, maybe somebody will force them to watch this film, to understand, what he he## we are fighting for...frankly, to the person who found this review unhelpful..i have a feeling, either you didnt see this movie, or were never going to see it anyway..so to you..i say..peace out, yo!</p></body></html>

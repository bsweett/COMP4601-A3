<meta name="summary" content="Borat: "Thank you for watch my film. I hope you like. Dziekuje.""></head><body><p>BORAT (2006) is easily the wackiest movie made in many a year. It's extremely politically incorrect, kinda juvenile in spots and just one huge laugh, that is, if the insulting of Jews, women and "retards," or seeing a nude 400 lb. guy in all his flabbiness won't put you off your popcorn.<br /><br />The full title (Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan) gives a sense of how our hero, as portrayed by Londoner Sacha Cohen, fractures the English language. Kazakhstani TV reporter Borat was originally one of three Cohen characters on the half-hour BBC-TV comedy series, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JBXH82">DA ALI G SHOW</a> (2003). This movie expands on his anti-Semitism, misogny and penchant for misspoken scatology as Borat films a documentary of his travels across America from east to west.<br /><br />Borat is based on an incredibly funny doctor that Cohen met while in southern Russia. Those of us who appreciate a good belly laugh are truly grateful for this chance encounter.<br /><br />Erran Cohen's fanciful national anthem "O Kazakhstan" has a tune and lyrics that immediately invade your brain. Here are two of its less-objectional verses:<br /><br />Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan you very nice place<br />From Plains of Darashik to Northern fence of Jewtown<br />Kazakhstan friend of all except Uzbekistan<br />A very nosy people with bone in their brain<br /><br />Kazakhstan industry best in world<br />We invented toffee and trouser pants<br />Kazakhstan's prostitutes cleanest in the region<br />Except of course for too many scars<br /><br />Extras on the DVD include outtakes (some good, some really boring) and a collage film of Sacha in character enjoying a new-found American fame that was at near-mania levels back in 2006.</p></body></html>

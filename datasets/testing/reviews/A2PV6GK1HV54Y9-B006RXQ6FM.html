I thought this film would be slow, boring, and preachy but to my surprise, this is one movie I plan on viewing again and again. Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Philip Seymour Hoffman all give powerful and seething performances. Doubt has serious subject matter but there are some quirky moments as well. So glad I watched this film, I highly recommend it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not smart to see this movie. :)"></head><body><p>My personal opinion of the movie only; no comparisons will be made to the original TV series:<br /><br />This movie had some of the lamest jokes I have ever seen and heard.  Many times it appears they are making up their lines as they go, but they can't come up with anything funny.<br /><br />There are some funny scenes in the movie, not hilarious, because the scenes are not pushed far enough to make it hilarious.<br /><br />example: The dance battle between the two main characters was poorly choreographed, too slow, and not silly enough to make it funny.<br /><br />example:  Laser room scene, again not pushed far enough to make it really funny.<br /><br />example: lady in bakery coming on to the main character<br /><br />Basically that's the problem with the movie, it's just not pushed far enough to make it truly hilarious.  Most of the jokes were just lazy and come across as very cheesy.</p></body></html>

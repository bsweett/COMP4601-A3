<meta name="summary" content="I had a ball looking for all the clues! Can you change FATE,and to what degree,if any can you.This film was OK!!!"></head><body><p>It is hard to not see PREMONITION and not be reminded of GROUNDHOG DAY and BACK TO THE FUTURE.All three films involve turning back the hands of time so as to change the outcome of the future.PREMONITION is especially eerie and convoluted,but that is what makes this film so interesting.Films that question FATE-is it absolute,can it be changed,to what degree can things change if it were possible are always asking the viewer to suspend certain time-bound notions and think of outside possibilities.<br /><br />As Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) keeps reliving past and present days concerning the death of her husband.You find yourself looking for the clues as to which day she is in based on past information,such as things done and said,people met,clothing worn,the weather,stickers on a glass door(even the tint of the film that the director uses in order to show time difference...which was quite novel!...it was alot of fun).I really thrive on twisted plots!For that this film is OKAY.There is one place where the film is contrived during Linda's visit to the Parish Priest who seems to be awfully informed about her ordeal, but this scene is crucial to the eventual outcome and lesson that Linda needs to learn. All in all this was an enjoyable film that bends the mind and keeps you alert.The soundtrack is appropriately EXORCISTIC!<br /><br />I don't think that PREMONITION will ever be greatly remembered as other films that tackle FATE ,but c'mon and lighten up...it is still worth an enjoyable one viewing...I will stretch to 4 stars....and besides,the movie DOES NOT end the way you think it will....so there!</p></body></html>

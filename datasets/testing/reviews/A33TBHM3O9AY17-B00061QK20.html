I guess it doesn't really matter, since this time he seems to have pulled it off pretty well.  "Hero" does what "House of Flying Daggers" tried but failed to do with any credibility -- to tell a poignant tale of passionate romance within the context of the classic Chinese martial arts film.<br /><br />Jet Li plays "Nameless", ostensibly the hero who saved the emperor of Qin from the deadly trio of assassins, Sky, Broken Sword and Falling Snow (the latter two being lovers).  Nameless is brought before the emperor, bearing the weapons of the three assassins as proof that he vanquished them, to be rewarded for his feat.  The emperor lavishes great honors on Nameless, and questions him about how he was able to defeat such powerful enemies.  As Nameless tells his tale, the storyline is played out as a series of flashbacks depicting each encounter.<br /><br />The emperor, however, is suspicious of Nameless, thinking him to be a crafty assassin himself and in league with the other three, using these concocted events as a way to get close to the emperor.  The emperor offers his own account of what he thinks really happened, and the story is retold to a different conclusion, again through a series of flashbacks.  Nameless notes that parts of the emperor's rendition are correct, but others are not, and tells a third and final version of the tale.  This leads to a surprising denouement, where the relationship of Broken Sword and Falling Snow is brought to a tragic climax.  The two disagree vehemently on whether the greater good would be served by killing the tyrannical emperor, as opposed to letting this strong ruler unite all the nations of China under one banner and thus end the wars that have raged for generations.  Broken Sword's ideal of "our land" and the good of the nation overrides his desire to kill the emperor, provoking a deadly challenge by Snow, with unexpected and unintended results.  In my opinion it is this element of the story that lends a great air of nobility to the movie as a whole, and redeems what might otherwise be just another high-tech martial arts movie.<br /><br />The rest of the film was relatively well done.  I thought the initial fight sequences involving Sky were great, but from there on the director relied way too much on the use of wires and special effects.  The remaining action scenes were a visual feast but lacked any real credibility, especially the fight at the lake, where Nameless and Broken Sword demonstrated an uncanny ability to walk on water.  The director's use of color was overwhelming and unmistakeable -- and at times overdone.  In general, though, the effect was positive and lent itself to a visually beautiful, if somewhat overly artsy, presentation.  If I were to compare "Hero" with "Crouching Tiger" and "Flying Daggers", I would definitely say this one is the best movie of the three.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Good evening&quot;"></head><body><p>This film is probably the greatest thriller movie of all time.  Personally it outshines Psycho.  The movie is chilling, disturbing, deep, and dramatic.  Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest pairings since Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh, they truely have wonderful chemistry.  Hannibal Lector is one of the greatest screen characters of all time and definately the greatest villain.  No other movie has made you dive into the mind of a psychotic maniac.  Jonathon Demme is truely a talented director.  He hasn't made a better film since.  This is one of my favorite films of all time.  I highly reccomend this movie to anyone, and everyone to see.</p></body></html>

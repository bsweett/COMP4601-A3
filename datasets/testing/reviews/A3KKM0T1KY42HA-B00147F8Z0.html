<meta name="summary" content="Aliens and Predators Versus the Dark"></head><body><p>In 1986 Director James Cameron made the first sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011V8IQ">Alien</a>...and Cameron's sequel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXAE">Aliens</a> was even better than the original (and appears on my Amazon Listmania list of Flicks Guaranteed to Leave a Permanent Impression). In all there were <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">4 Alien movies</a>.<br /><br />Then in 1987 Jon McTiernan made one of the best movies ever with Arnold Schwarzenegger called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012GVKW8">Predator</a>. In 1990 a fair at best <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006BGWR8">Predator sequel</a> followed, but gave us our first teaser glimpse of a possible Alien versus Predator movie in the form of an Alien's skull in a Predator's trophy case.<br /><br />In 1989 Dark Horse originally merged the two franchises into a comic book, and in the 90s the video game industry took a bunch of stabs at Alien versus Predator action games.<br /><br />We finally got the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04P6">Alien Vs. Predator</a> feature film in 2004 from Paul Anderson, a video game to movie specialist. And it wasn't *that* bad. It's major flaw came at the end when a mutated Alien hatched from a Predator. Why flawed you say? Because the parasitic Alien race was unique by planting its eggs within a host, but it didn't mean that the Aliens took on the attributes of the host, right?<br /><br />Strangely, it is this flawed concept that visual effects masters turned directors The Strause Brothers latched onto and built a movie around with AVP: Requiem. But the flaws don't end there with AVP: Requiem. There are flaws o'plenty, technical and theatrical. The acting is horrible and the film uses recycled line after line from the Alien and Predator films that preceded it.<br /><br />AVP: Requiem's story starts out pretty good, but quickly falls apart. There are story continuity issues (like the miraculously short time between human "infection" and swarms of Aliens appearing), and a there's a cast that seems like the rejects from some failed WB TV show that just can't pull off any semblance of believability in their performances.<br /><br />AVP: Requiem's worst fault is that it is dark and you can hardly see the action. What James Cameron did in Aliens was awesome; he gave you an in your face, up close look at the creatures that in the 1979 original were mostly hidden in the shadows. The Strause Brothers once again latched on to the wrong concept; instead of taking Cameron's lead and showing us the creatures, they took the 1979 idea of darkness and put us in *advanced* darkness. What's the point of a Blu Ray disc if you can't see anything???<br /><br />AVP: Requiem fails miserably where Cameron excelled...Cameron gave you a movie that you could *watch*...The Strause Brothers gave us one we can't...for more reasons than just the darkness.</p></body></html>

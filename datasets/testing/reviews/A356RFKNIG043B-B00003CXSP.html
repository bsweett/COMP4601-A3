<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>This sequel is rather pointless and lacks most of what made Lambs great.<br />They spent the cash and got the pros---Scott, Mamet and Hopkins---but the lynchpin of the first movie has been removed and that kills it.<br /><br />Jodie Foster made you care about her; Julianne Moore does not. She's emotionally flat and quite boring, and the movie suffers greatly due to her weak performance as the character Foster made fascinating.<br /><br />Hannibal is also paced far too slowly and even when it's gory, in its faux-elegant way, it's not really scary. There's little suspense and the sudden weirdness of the last 20 minutes offers no payoff. Hopkins is good but without Foster's heart to play off there's not much to make this truly worth watching. Even the cannibal moments are kinda boring.<br /><br />I usually love Scott, but his grand shots are mostly lacking here and Mamet's script is too plodding to keep one entertained.<br /><br />Not even close to the quality of the original; if you really love that you might want to avoid this and Hannibal Rising. They add nothing to the story.</p></body></html>

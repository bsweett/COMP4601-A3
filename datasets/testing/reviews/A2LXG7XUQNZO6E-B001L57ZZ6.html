So, yeah here I am reviewing Eagle Eye and though LeBeouf still hasn't impressed me with his range, the film itself did most definitely hit the spot. It was an exciting, fast-paced, action-packed thriller and a comparison to films like WarGames and 2001: The Year We Made Contact would be quite accurate as they share many similarities.<br /><br />There really wasn't much about this film I didn't like and that includes the CG action sequences and, yes, LeBeouf's performance, despite it being indistinguishable from roles he's played prior to this film. Caruso's direction was tight, cinematography was highly effective and the score was appropriate, though not entirely memorable.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray features include some beautiful and informative HD featurettes including a startling piece on the current state of our privacy in a technologically evolving, post 9/11 America (Is My Cell Phone Spying on Me?) and a candid discussion between director D.J. Caruso and WarGames director John Badham (Shall We Play A Game?). If you're interested in hearing more in-depth information about the production of this film, check out "Road Trip," and learn about the different locales the film was shot at and the definitive "Making Of" featurette "Asymmetric Warfare: The Making of Eagle Eye," which includes interviews with cast & crew.</p></body></html>

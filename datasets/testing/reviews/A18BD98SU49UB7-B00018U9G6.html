<meta name="summary" content="Cool as Peanut Butter"></head><body><p>School of Rock will forever embody what Jack Black may have been, if not for a little band known as Tenacious D. <p>In a world... Where Dewey needs a job...and no one will hire him because he's a rock-loving, stoner...until he impersonates his room-mate...to sub in a preppy, private school's music class...comes: "School of Rock!" <p>Jack Black was made for this movie and visa-versa. He is given the space he needs to go rampant with his wild antics of rockacious fortitude; Like Robin Williams as an auction caller. He is able to show his dramatic capabilities as well, along with many hilarious quip's of sarcasm. I haven't laughed that hard and continuous in any movie that I can remember. Comedic Value? Cha-ching. I will own it the day it comes out. Long Live TD. ~s.a.o.s.~</p></body></html>

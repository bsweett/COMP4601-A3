<meta name="summary" content="There he was, looking for love!"></head><body><p>From time to time, we use to watch - thanks to the unrestricted rules of the conventional circuits - films that breath a warm poetry, a fine artistic feature, surrounded of an accurate sense of existential vertigo.<br /><br />An aspirant to actor, who lives in Los Angeles, is notified about his mother has paused away. A long time has gone since he left his birthplace; his childhood friends have grown up and have decided to undertake different professions. That sad reencounter with his family and circle of friends dates him back to his origins, but besides will allow an unexpected love.<br /><br />The film has three brilliant sequences, the first one  is when we realize the emotional burden that represented the horrid accident suffered by his mother  that affected him since his early childhood (he was nine, by then), carrying with him the enormous weight of the guilt over all those years; on the other hand the brief but memorable clash with his father (brilliantly performed by Ian Holm) and third that mesmerizing metaphor of the unfathomable abbeys in the coda of the plot, that works out as an admirable mirror image of his own existence, acting over him as a powerful device to bring him back to the lost emotional equilibrium.<br /><br />Nathalie Portman steals herself the show with her memorable acting. She looks so natural through her dialogues, absolutely identified with her role that constitutes one of the sever highlights of this unconventional portrait of what the lack of love may infringe on the human behavior and at the meantime how this same feeling brings him back to the normality.<br /><br />A film that must be seen due its ambitious proposals.</p></body></html>

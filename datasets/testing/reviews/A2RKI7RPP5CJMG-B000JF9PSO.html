It is a near real-time account of what happened on the doomed United flight that was headed for San Francisco but ended up in a field in Pennsylvania when its passengers overpowered the cowards who intended to use it to hit our nation's capitol.  It opens with the cowards preparing for their mission.  We are then given the seemingly mundane but all-important events of preparing a flight for take-off.  We get very brief glimpses at the lives of the pilot, co-pilot, and the steward staff.  We learn that some of them have children, some of them have been to London, and others are looking forward to a little time off.  We get hints at the lives of the passengers as well.  Some of the have dealings with Sony, some of them are going to meet family, others are planning a visit to Yosemite.  All of these things seem so simple, so "average," but the viewer realizes that none of these normal, everyday events will never come to fruition due to the actions of a few others on board the flight.<br /><br />We also learn of the chaos that tears air traffic controllers apart as they try to determine the fate of a multitude of hijacked and possibly hijacked flights.  Who or what hit the Towers?  Where are those three other planes headed?  Why can't we get airspace clearance from the FAA.  Should we ground an entire nation's flight schedule?  Why is their no response from American 11?<br /><br />This is simply a moving film.  I almost didn't want to watch it because I didn't know how I'd react.  I'll admit that I cried a lot.  I was also very, very angered by the actions of the cowards on the flight.  Yet in the end I was glad to have watched this film.  It showed just how strong the American spirit can be.  Even though the brave souls on United 93 were well aware of their impending fates, they came together to save the lives of so many others.<br /><br />This single-disc edition provides a trailer for "Twin Towers" and an hour-long documentary with interviews of surviving family members of the heroes on Flight 93.  It also has a memorial with a brief biography of all of the heroes who perished defending their country and their fellow man.  Each biography is written by a family member or dear friend.<br /><br />This film will make you cry.  It will make you angry.  It will also make you proud.  You'll be proud that no matter what our enemies throw at us, we as Americans can and will find a way to defeat them.  Naysayers cannot deny the bravery displayed on United 93, nor can they erase the horrible events of September 11, 2001 from our memory, try as they might.</p></body></html>

All those saying that it can't possibly happen in real life have no imagination.  I have no doubt that the restoration of life from extinct genetic material will one day be possible, and that is what makes this movie so exciting.  The plot is secondary to the main ideas in the movie, and is not important.  Bravo to a great movie, with great effects.</p></body></html>

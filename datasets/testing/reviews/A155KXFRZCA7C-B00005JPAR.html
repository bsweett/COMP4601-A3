<meta name="summary" content="An unfinished Cinematic Painting"></head><body><p>I'm sure reading the book must have been much more interesting than the film itself - I haven't read the book. The movie is a collage of scenes of an artsy film. There are a lot of repeated scenes apparently in an attempt to keep the audience on track of the story and in which direction the flick is moving. Needless to say, that the trailer seemed to promise something different and therefore my expectations weren't met at all.<br /><br />The acting was very good and that's why I give this film 3 stars, because otherwise it would be less than that. I don't think Aronofsky as a director did a very good job of telling the story - it's a lot of going back and forth with some boring scenes, ... confusing with New Age junk mixed into it. In a sense it's like an unfinished cinematic painting, and the soundtrack is kind of annoying after a while. And whenever a scene reaches a climax and there's an expectation for a surprise, nothing happens and it's a letdown. To me it was like an experimental film or a project as the final exam of a student to graduate from film school. There are lots of closeups - too many if you ask me.<br /><br />If you do want to see this film in the theatre, you must hurry, because I don't think this film will survive more than a week on the big screen - the theatre I went to was almost empty while the other flicks there were filled to capacity.</p></body></html>

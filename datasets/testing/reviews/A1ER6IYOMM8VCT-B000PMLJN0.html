<meta name="summary" content="GOOD OLD FASHIONED HORROR FILM ! VENTRILOQUIST DOLLS ARE SCARY!"></head><body><p>What a breath of fresh air this film was to watch!.....or should I say a breath of good old fashioned "Universal" chills? I finally watched this movie and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of creepy atmosphere it had. The dolls in this movie are freaky looking and I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up more than once while watching this classic style fright flick.<br /><br />This is a "ghost story" in every sense of the words and ventriloquist dolls are very, very scary! There are some clever plot twist and excellent camera work in this spooky thrill ride that plays like your riding through an old creepy dark ride at an amusement park or carnival. I also found that the use of 'silence'("Dead Silence")when things are about to go wrong, was ingenious and it worked like the music in 'Jaws' did, whenever it went silent you knew something bad was going to happen! This is one of the cleverest horror movies I've seen in a while and it has little or no gore.<br /><br />The unrated version has a little more visual blood(very little)and also a plot point which helps to make the story make more sense. I liked both versions of the film and I'm not sure if it matters which one you buy. I just wish that the studios would stop releasing these film on separate releases when there is so little difference.....no wonder it didn't sell well. This is a great Halloween flick to start that night with a good fright! Look quick for the "Saw Puppet" on the floor amongst the debris! Stay up late, turn out the lights and watch this alone!......you'll see what I mean!</p></body></html>

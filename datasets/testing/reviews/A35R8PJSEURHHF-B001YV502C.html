Many things were thrown at you in this movie, but little was ever explained. Cast was annoying and I couldn't have cared less if they survived or not.  The usual story of a group of people trying to escape, finding a safe house, safe house gets raided, people escape to another place, and eventually finding freedom. z  z zzz Again extremely boring the way it all played out in this movie.</p></body></html>

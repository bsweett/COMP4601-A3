The best part of the movie is the interplay between the uptight Starsky and his laid-back, fun-loving partner, Hutch.  Some of the scenes are funny and some of them are tasteless, but it all averages out to a pretty average movie.  It's fun for nostalgia buffs, but nothing to write home about.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="solid, dark sci-fi with good characters"></head><body><p>I vividly remember having seen this when it came out.  Heston was phenomenal as an action hero, and a wonderful actor to boot.  While the sequels lost me, this I always thought was a great film.<br /><br />So I got a copy for my kids.  We viewed it together and greatly enjoyed it.  They were full of questions and observations - always a good sign -  but also enjoyed the action.  My son (7) talked about it for the following week.<br /><br />As I have not seen it in about 35 years, I was surprized at how much I liked it.  Usually, on viewing a sci-fi oldie I enjoyed at 6 or 12, I am disappointed at how flimsy it seems in terms of plot and realism.  Happily, this is hard sci-fi in that it is at least not impossible, and there are interesting characters:  Taylor the cynic, Dr Zeias the guardian of orthodoxy, and the scientist/intellectual chimps as well as Cornelius, the rebellious young one.  The story hangs together well and has a startlingly fresh conclusion that is not happy.<br /><br />Warmly recommended for all ages.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Triumph for Tom Hanks"></head><body><p>This movie is a tour de force for Tom Hanks and has some very compelling moments.  In the beginning of the movie, he is shown as a FedEx employee who is obsessed with time schedules and spends copious amounts of time on his cell-phone and answering his beeper.  He is a slave to his job as evidenced by a Christmas Day departure for a business trip which forces him and his fiance, played by Helen Hunt, to open their gifts in the car before he leaves.  Helen Hunt is sadly underutilized in this part, by the way.  By far the best scenes in the movie occur during the circumstances which strand him on an uninhabited island and the time in which he lives on the island.  Needless to say, his priorities change drastically and he is kept going by a fading picture of his girlfriend and by accomplishments such as discovering water and creating fire.  The scenes before and after this segment are poorly written and unconvincing and if anyone but Tom Hanks was saying some of these lines, we'd never believe them.  The island scenes were well-done, but I was left with a vaguely unsatisfied feeling at the end.</p></body></html>

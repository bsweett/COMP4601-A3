<meta name="summary" content="The Enemy Of My Enemy Is The Marketer Of This Film"></head><body><p>Alexa Woods (the beautiful Sanaa Lathan) is ice climbing when she gets a rather rude phone call. Someone wants her to put her life on hold and guide a group of explorers into an as-of-yet unknown pyramid found on a make-believe island next door to Antarctica. And that someone is billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen, Aliens), of the Weyland Corporation.<br /><br />The group of trepid explorers find their way to this frozen little land and discover that something has cut a hole in the ice at a 30 degree angle. And this hole leads down hundreds of yards to where the newly discovered pyramid rests.<br /><br />Once Alexa, Weyland, and the other members make their way into the pyramid, a shifting maze suddenly separates the parties. And waiting for them are the Aliens, ready to impregnant them with their nasty little eggs and get those chests a-bursting.<br /><br />But also, coming from outer space, are The Predators (no, Ahhnolds not coming back). The Predators have held a queen Alien in captivity within the pyramid for centuries. And what the Predators are excited about is that they can finally hunt and have their right of passage (as a Predator, you must kill off the Aliens in order to pass into the upper echelons of their order...I think). Humans are seen as a possible way out by the Aliens (if they can breed enough, they might be able to overpower the Predators). But the Predators only see humans as a means to an end. They're just chess pieces. They really just want to kick some bad-boy Alien booty.<br /><br />***********************************************************************<br /><br />What was good about the film?<br /><br />Being a fan of the Alien quadrilogy (is that really a word?), I was happy to be reaquainted with them, even if for a short while. I love the way they look and move.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first Predator film, but the second one left me wanting in a not-so-kindly way. I also thought it was kinda cool that an alien race (the Predators) would come to Earth and use it just as a hunting ground for trophies (i.e., human skulls).<br /><br />The action between the Aliens and Predators was pretty nice. I liked the futuristic boomerangs that the Predators carried and I really liked seeing the hand to hand (do Aliens have hands?) combat between the two.<br /><br />Where this movie fell short was in its editing.<br /><br />Obviously, some genius sitting behind a marketing desk (and looking up God-only-knows what kind of statistics) decided to cut and paste this movie until it met with a PG-13 rating. WHY?! The Alien series is an R-rated series, as was Predator. Cutting out any excessive gore, violence, or other pertinent scenes is ridiculous! Listen to me, whoever you are out there in Hollyweird-Land. Don't EVER do that again! Shame on you.<br /><br />I've read complaints from other reviewers about the lack of character development in this film. So what. Quit yer grippin'. It was never MEANT to be a character film. What was in there was enough to keep me interested in them. But only just.<br /><br />Final words: Sequel? If so, they BETTER NOT GET A PG-13 RATING ON IT OR I'M GONNA BE P#$$ED!</p></body></html>

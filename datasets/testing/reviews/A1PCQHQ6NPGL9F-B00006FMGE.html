<meta name="summary" content="Terrible sequel to a great movie."></head><body><p>The movie starts you out with an older Harry Potter. It's obvious that he is going through puberty because his voice is squeakin' and it makes him sound goofy at times. They are all going through puberty. Anyways, I think the film really falls short in terms of enjoyment.<p>The new people offer no excitement. Sure, mabye that teacher guy was okay... Draco's father is incredibly boring and isn't really mysterious at all. He can't really act at all. From what it looks like, they hired him because he is somewhat resembalant of Draco but he isn't convincing enough to be enjoyable.<p>The movie has it's action, but the first half is boring. The first 20 minutes of the movie have some nice special effects but overall they set the tone for a boring and prolonged movie.<p>To wrap it up though, in the end... a movie will get a lot of praise if it is a popular book adaptation. Pass this one up. Sorry to those who are die-hard fans. I do not think this movie was very entertaining though.</p></body></html>

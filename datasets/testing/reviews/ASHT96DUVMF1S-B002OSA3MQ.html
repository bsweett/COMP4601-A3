This movie is written and directed so well. Many scenes stand out in my mind like the Ferris wheel, and the sewer chase.  Criterion collection has made this film enjoyable. The picture is almost flawless. I don't think this movie could work in color.  The black and white scenes work to enhance the streets and the sewer along with cinematography.  This is a classic and should be watched by anyone calling themselves a movie fan.</p></body></html>

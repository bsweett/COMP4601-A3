<meta name="summary" content="One demerit for not bringing back the original Clarice ..."></head><body><p>which took a little of the edge off this movie in my eyes. There is only ONE Hannibal Lechter and thats Anthony Hopkins and there is only one Clarice and of course that's Jodie F. OKOK so I'm one of the dinasours that believes that theres only ONE James Bond and that is Sean Connery ...... <p>Julianne Moore does an acceptabble job but she just seems to have that hardened edge of a street wise late 30's New York kind of woman. Jodie Foster, does not, she always looks counrty no matter how many guns she has in her hands..... Along the lines of mis-casting, I thought that Ray Liotta, as Clarices scheming miserable back stabbing boss, was poop.... he never convinced me as an FBI type that's for sure... <p>The DVD is fabulous and, in most respect, true to the book. Matter of fact I preferred the movie since the ending was left wide open as compared to the book that had what I really considered was a completly shocking surprise ending. <p>The movie also left out Mason Verger's sister almost completely ... HMMMM wonder why ... I thought she added a little intrigue to the show .... and well we won't talk about Vergers Micheal Jackson type of obsession for playing games with kids that were also omitted in the movie..... <p>On a happy note, the pigs astounding and if they have an academy award for animals then these 550 pound beauties get my vote thats for sure .... <p>I don't know if I would buy the movie with two major miscasts, but if you love Anthony Hokins slurping his toung while munching on fava beans the run to the store and get the DVD now .....</p></body></html>

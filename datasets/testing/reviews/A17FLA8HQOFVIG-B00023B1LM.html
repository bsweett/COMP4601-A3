<meta name="summary" content="Premise impossible to relate to and I actually fell asleep"></head><body><p>This 2002 film is based on the novel by Robert Ludlum.  Matt Damon is cast in the role of a man rescued from the sea by some French fishermen.  He has two bullet holes in his back as well as a small vial under his skin which reveals the number of a Swiss bank account.  He just doesn't know his name or anything else about himself.<p> <p>So far so good.  It's rather intriguing to watch Damon's acting, especially when he goes to the Swiss bank and discovers passports from many countries with his photo as well as lots of cash.  And, by the way, he also finds himself fluent in  French and German as well as English.  <p> <p>All of a sudden, his life is in danger.  And so is the life of the pretty girl, played by Frank Potente, who only meant to give him a lift to Paris and never meant the relationship to develop past that.  Ha Ha!<p> <p>Somehow the CIA is involved and paid assassins are sent to kill our hero.  Chris Cooper is cast as the evil CIA commander.  It's an easy role and certainly below the quality of fine acting demanded in other films such as Seabiscuit and Adaptation.  But I guess that the powers that be know that he'll be good in whatever role is cast his way.<p> <p>There's lots of action, several murders and many chase scenes.  And I think I was supposed to care.  But I found the premise impossible to relate to, and the action similar to that in a thousand other films.  And when the plot got confusing, I actually fell asleep and missed the last 20 minutes of the film.</p></body></html>

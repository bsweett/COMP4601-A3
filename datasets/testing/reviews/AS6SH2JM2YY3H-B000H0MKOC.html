Whether you realize it or not, we are constantly bombarded with messages about what is cool, or hip, or deadly, or immoral.<br /><br />This is a fictionalized account of one such battle:  smoking tobacco.  When the evidence is so clear that smoking harms both the smoker and others inhaling the smoke, why is smoking tobacco still legal?  It is because there is a cadre of professionals whose job it is to make sure we hear and absorb certain messages, like the government wants smokers to die so that agencies can get larger budgets, while tobacco companies want smokers to live because smokers are their best customers (example taken from the movie)!<br /><br />This film is very entertaining, with a number of great, great actors.  Rated PG-13, and highly recommended.  I give this film 4 stars instead of 5 because the sex scenes (admittedly limited) and language will keep younger children from seeing this film... and I'd like to see more people, not less, view this film.</p></body></html>

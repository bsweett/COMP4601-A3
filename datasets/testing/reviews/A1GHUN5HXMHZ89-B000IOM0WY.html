Wahlberg and Norton are fantastic and the rest of the supporting cast are super.<p><p>I was disappointed that Donald Sutherland's role was so brief, but even so he is quite effective. The story line of revenge is only marginally contrived but the director brings us around to his way of thinking. He sets us right with the incredible precision heist mechanics and the wonderful chase scenes and of course the cute Mini Coopers.<p><p>Any fan of good remakes of older heist movies with above average acting like &quot;Oceans Eleven&quot; and &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; should love it.<p><p>The DVD quality is unsurpassed and all the extras including a making of documentary and the Mini Cooper stunts make it well worth owning.</p></body></html>

An incredible feat, this first film to incorporate animation with live action.  Dick Van Dyke and ensemble, not to mention Julie Andrews, who I believe is so credible as Mary Poppins, and she's so likeable, laughable that it's a shame that no other movies came along with her, but that was before sequels.  I'd say that this is at the top of the heap of all the best and the brightest of movies.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!  And after you've seen it, you'll all want to "...go fly a kite," as the song said.  Inspiring, romantic, and it makes you feel good, too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Malice In Wonderland"></head><body><p>There was quite the schism when Tim Burton remade <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BB1MI2">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>.  Some felt like he'd injected a much needed dose of modern madness to Dahl's tale of Kids Behaving Badly.  Others felt like he'd bastardized an already <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009FGWN0">pitch perfect film</a> by making the whole thing acidic and aggressive.  He made the factory grander, weirder, and far more unsettling, and he took Gene Wilder's impishly subdued Wonka and made him into a twitchy germaphobe with creepy teeth.  I found it difficult to compare the two films, because it seemed like they were trying to do two completely different things.  The first film was about childish wonder and the fine line between growing up and growing old.  The second film was about daddy issues and the dangers of drug abuse.  I think.<br /><br />Burton's next big remake, ALICE IN WONDERLAND suffers from the same division of purpose.  In fact, it would be far better if the film had been billed as a sequel.  ALICE IN WONDERLAND II: BEYOND THE THUNDERDOME.  Alice is no longer a precocious and curious child, and when she falls down the rabbit hole this second time, she realizes that she misheard the name of the place when she was younger.  It's not called Wonderland.  It's called Underland.  Burton is known for his darkness, and that name change gives you a good idea of just where Burton applied most of the strokes of his grim, black brush.  The effect is contrary to what most people (fans of the original, for sure) will be expecting from the film.  The original was about the wonder and beauty of a child's imagination; this film is about the dreary blackness of control.<br /><br />Of course, the original Wonderland had its dark sides (not the least of which being a queen with a penchant for beheadings), but those dark sides were the unavoidable shadows you got from all the loony brightness that dripped from the trees or exploded from the ground (or just appeared out of thin air).  What Burton has done is take all that background menace and bring it straight to the fore, so that the wonder and enchantment take a backseat to the film's angry (and rather dull) plot.  What we have here is a Wonderland -- excuse me; I mean Underland -- that is steadily decaying under the rule of its Machiavellian queen ("It's better to be feared than loved," she mutters, a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979415403">The Prince</a> surely hidden beneath her dress).  According to a prophetic scroll, Alice must return and restore order to the world by dispatching of the queen's barbarous pet, the Jabberwocky (a beast lifted from a few of Carroll's poems).<br /><br />Wonderland as Carroll described it was always distinctly amoral.  It sprawled and seethed and pulsed with chaotic color.  Burton's Underland is all about justice and slavishness and it hisses with murky moodiness.  Instead of having a Mad Hatter of dizzying antics and baffling wordplay, you now have Depp's (oddly Scottish) Hatter, a man who is less mad than he is bi-polar.  One minute he is railing against the queen and crying for rebellion, the next minute he's sadly melting into himself as if struggling with senility.  He shares the screen with the excessively plastic White Queen (Anne Hathaway cheesing it up big time) and the encephalitic Red Queen (played by an emotionally mute Helena Bonham Carter; she uses about as many facial expressions as an actual deck of cards, and I never once believed her when she called for yet another person's head).  The only character who really lights up the screen is, of course, the Cheshire Cat, and even his psychotic omnipresence is neutered by the film's insistence on rules (I CANNOT believe a character actually claimed there were rules in Wonderland!) and structure.<br /><br />There's no real plot to Carroll's tale, and that was part of its beauty and charm.  Burton's movie, on the other hand, is what you get when people pretend that madness is supposed to make sense.  Although it doesn't need to be said that Burton has created a visually arresting tale (the 3D mostly a so-so addition), he hasn't done anything to enchant the mind or heart.  He has instead replaced Carroll's whimsy with bellicose dreariness, and he's supplanted the frivolity with your basic (and boring) movie morals: Believe in yourself!  Don't back down from adversity!  Enslave the Chinese with the opium trade!<br /><br />Forget I said that last part.  I'm not sure what it has to do with the movie, unless it's Burton's way of slapping himself in his own face.  You won't get the reference unless you see the film to the very end anyway.  If you do, then you might find, like I did, that this final moment of the movie makes the preceding bits all the darker.  It proves that, although fun in all the most obvious ways, Burton's film still lacks charm, grandeur, and the kind of loony and limitless innocence that makes Wonderland a place anyone -- young or old -- would ever want to visit.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Saw III - The downfall of Jigsaw"></head><body><p>After consecutively watching the entire Saw series over a recent weekend (and LOVING it), I decided that a single review with modified details could be used for all the films.  Enjoy.<br /><br />A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.<br /><br />Saw THREE begins with ONE person trapped in an abandoned MEATPACKING PLANT.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John "Jigsaw" Kramer) game, JEFF (Angus Macfadyen) has to prove his will to live, and his ability to FORGIVE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), OFFICER DANIEL RIGG (Lyriq Bent), and rugged veteran DET. MARK HOFFMAN (Costas Mandylor) are investigating as a team, but ALLISON KERRY may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participant learns that AMANDA YOUNG (Shawnee Smith) may be an accomplice to his abduction, and his situation provides a choice between VARIOUS TRAPS (for OTHERS) or guaranteed death (for his family).  To help his cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead him (aka life perpetrator) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.<br /><br />Several murderous contraptions like the CHAIN CHAIR (for a HABITUAL CRIMINAL), the PIG VAT TRAP (for an ACTIVIST JUDGE), and the NECK BREAKER RACK TRAP (for a MURDERER) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the opening scene EXPLODING RIB ANGEL TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S MODUS OPERANDI, and on to Saw IV.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

A long-lost civilization ? This romp to planet Altair, besieged by an unknown evil force, is unbelievably hilarious for its pulp and sixties sensibility. The movie always threatens to morph into a weird episode of some sixties sitcom with a name like "Leave it to Beaver" in outer space. Bonus points for having a story that actually makes sense and manages to be interesting, despite the movie being hilarious. Definitively to watch if you love bad movies.</p></body></html>

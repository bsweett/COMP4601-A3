<meta name="summary" content="In extremely poor taste"></head><body><p>One reviewer noted that "Splice" has more in common with the films of David Cronenberg than anything Vincenzo Natali has been involved with.  That's an understatement.  This would be Vincenzo Natali taking direct cues from David Cronenberg and Piero Pasolini on a darker day and giving birth, no pun intended, to this disgusting piece of trash.<br /><br />Adrien Brody plays Clive Nicoli--his character's appearance itself is enough to tell you "not a quality movie" (bleached red hair and corporate hipster wear, just not jiving with Brody's regular appearance)--a young scientist who believes that anything is okay to do in science, blaming those "ignorant fascists" (meaning Christians) who think that any caution in science is unacceptable.  Sarah Polley plays Elsa Kast, his live in girlfriend who feels the same way.<br /><br />In short what happens is this: these two psychologically compromised people end up creating what looks like Sinead O Connor with a slice in the top of it's head.  As a baby it looks kind of appealing, and that's the cruel ruse of the movie: it wants to warm you up to the idea of this kind of "science", and then turn you on your head and stomach for ever having cherished the creature or the characters.  Let's just say that some disgusting things happen between the three (one count of incest, one count of rape), and the whole thing is like black bile.<br /><br />This is not even shocking art in the sense of "breaking taboos", it is just unpleasant and gross.  Not recommended at all.</p></body></html>

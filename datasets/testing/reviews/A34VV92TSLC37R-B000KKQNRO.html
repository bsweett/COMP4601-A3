<meta name="summary" content="An exercise in mediocrity"></head><body><p>Do what you are supposed do to, and absolutely nothing more. That is the attitude that a lot of people use throughout life. Whether it's at work, with your family, or in relationships, it is the attitude that makes people and their lives totally unimpressive. This is the exact same attitude that turns The Da Vinci Code into an exercise in mediocrity.<br /><br />Let me say that this review is being written as a film geek, and not as a Christian. I was really excited to see this movie. Despite the horrid reviews, I still thought the movie was going to be good because it was being based off of such entertaining source material. While the book was pretty crappy writing, it was definitely a page-turner. Throughout my reading of the book, I was constantly thinking what a great movie it was going to make. Turns out I was wrong...<br /><br />It's tough to describe what actually happened to make the movie so boring. I think it's because the writers stayed too true to the book. You'd think that would make a better movie, but what ends up happening is that we get a lot of pointless, annoying, unnecessary flashbacks along with a lot of drawn out, agonizing monologues from the main characters. In movie form, these methods of communication just don't really translate to exciting cinema. I sat stationary for pretty much the entire film. Never once was I excited. I know you're saying that of course I wouldn't be excited because I knew what was coming, but if a book to film transition is done well, watching the movie can be a whole new experience, and that definitely didn't happen here. I basically felt dead inside while watching the movie.<br /><br />I really did want to like this movie. In fact, at the end of the film the writers added on some dialogue between Robert and Sophie that made me want to like it even more. In this conversation, Robert talks about prayer, and "what matters is what you believe." Does it even really change anything if Jesus was married and fathered a child? I don't really have a set belief on that yet, but I am leaning towards no. The ending dialogue really showed me that the filmmakers just wanted to make a good movie. They failed, but at least they won't offend anyone by what they did.</p></body></html>

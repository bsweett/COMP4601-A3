<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected and I expected alot!"></head><body><p>This was is a terrific movie very original as the front of the dvd says "Kill Bill meets Looney Toones" I would say thats accurate I knew this film would be good but didnt really expect to get cought up in it like a did.Besides for the the great fight scenes the cgi great but the characters are teffiffic.I've seen the dvd version already and its great the picture and sound are really good and also the special features include a 30 min. interview with director Stephen Chow for american audiences plus a 45 min making of documentary,Really good stuff Buy IT.</p></body></html>

Taking the source material and using it as a mere foundation for a far more accessible story, `How to Train Your Dragon' is one of those rare films that gets the clich&eacute;s just right.  I'm certainly a skeptic when it comes to clich&eacute;s, but certain films underscore them in a way that makes them feel pertinent to the story, and that is the case here.  Instead of transferring the oddly uninspired prose developed in the children's book to the big screen, `How to Train Your Dragon' is something completely different and far more effective thanks to the sharp changes made to the story itself.<br /><br />The film follows an unlikely hero, Hiccup.  Hiccup is a Viking, son to the chief and yet he is, well, not very Viking-like.  He's small and scrawny and peaceable, as opposed to big and brawny and violent.  When all of Hiccup's fellow villagers are waging war against the dragons, slaying them left and right and training their hardest to defend their livelihoods, Hiccup is befriending them.  Soon it becomes apparent to Hiccup that the misconception surrounding these winged beasts needs to be addressed, and changed for the betterment of the Viking people and for the dragons themselves.  With his newfound friend, a rare and dangerous dragon he names Toothless, Hiccup attempts to change the minds of his people, but that is easier said than done.<br /><br />One thing of note regarding this film; it is visually arresting.  The CGI animation is superb, truly.  The character details are wonderful (Toothless himself being a wonder to the eyes) and the editing is as sharp as they come; splicing through scenes with marvelous effect.<br /><br />The story, one of acceptance and love and growth, is exemplified by the simplistic approach to the script.  Like I said, it is one of those films that takes advantage of the clich&eacute;s it possesses.  Having read the source material (and not caring for it much at all), it is nice to see the themes presented in a much farer fashion in this splendid film.  The humor is subtle, yet effective, never beating the audience over the head with manipulated gags and one-liners.  Instead, the film allows the softness of the story to transcend.<br /><br />The themes of loyalty and love are given a nice touch with each passing frame.<br /><br />With tons of excitement and charm to boot, with a story that will appease both kid and adults, `How to Train Your Dragon' is yet another notch in the animation belt of 2010 (god, what a great year for animated films).  Don't worry too much about the thrills here either, as the action is presented in a way that the humor can shine and the scares don't last.  You'll little ones won't be hiding under the blanket or complaining of nightmares here.<br /><br />This one is all fun and games!</p></body></html>

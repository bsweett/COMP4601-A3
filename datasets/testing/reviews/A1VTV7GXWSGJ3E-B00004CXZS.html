<meta name="summary" content="The Best Star Trek Movie to Date."></head><body><p>Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan was a great rebound after the fiasco of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. While the first movie seemed desperate and unending (and downright stupid at times) ST II was a joy to behold. The plot was solid, it had the best villian, and the special effects were wonderful by 1980's standards.<p>The story is basically a sequel from an old Star Trek TV episode called Space Seed. In it Khan (played magnificently by Ricardo Montalban) is a leader of a small genetically engineered group of &quot;super-beings&quot; who had been left in hibernation for 200 years drifting in space. After trying and failing to take over the Enterprize he and his group are left on a deserted planet to build anew. The movie starts 15 years into the future. The planet had experienced an enviorement disaster, causing all life to perish. All that is left is Khan and his dwindling group barely surviving. By sheer luck they are liberated by a starship, which they take over, and Khan is unleashed to seek his revenge. The film plays out almost like a chess match. The battle of wits between Kirk and Khan goes back and forth, leading Khan deeper and deeper into madness.<p>The highlight of this movie is quite simply: the cast. Of course all your favorite Star Trek crew members are here. The supporting cast include the aforementioned Ricardo Montalban, Bibi Besch as the old love interest of Kirk, Paul Winfield as the Captain of the U.S.S. Reliant, and a VERY young Kirstie Ally.<p>I would HIGHLY recommend this to not only the Star Trek Fan, but to any sci-fi movie fan. It's action-pack from start to end.</p></body></html>

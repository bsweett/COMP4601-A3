<meta name="summary" content="Reservoir Dogs"></head><body><p>Watching RESERVOIR DOGS for the first time a dozen years late is an odd experience.  It's like watching a football game - long stretches when nothing is happening are punctuated by brief moments of exaggerated violence, following by more interminably long stretches.<br /> A group of low-rent thugs are recruited by a crime boss to steal a shipment of diamonds.  To protect things, nobody uses their real names.  Rather they are given color names - Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, etc.  If they're caught, that deep level of anonymity will protect the rest of the group.  RESERVOIR DOGS is all about what happens when good heists go bad.  And this one goes very bad indeed.<br />  There is some very graphic violence here and gallons of movie blood are spilled; I strongly suggest anyone with a weak taste for such things pass this one by.  There are also some scenes that just go on and on and on, minutes after they've finished their business.  The characters, save for a few exceptions, are vaguely drawn.  I watched the special with the critics' review and I guess this was all intentional on Quentin Tarantino's part.<br /> The cast is excellent.  I don't usually like graphically violent movie, but I thought the infamous "ear" scene was very well done.  Yeah, it's brutal and it'll make you squirm some, it wasn't needed to push the story along, but it works.<br />  I give this one a tepid endorsement, mainly because I'm a big fan of Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superior survival horror"></head><body><p>I knew nothing about The Crazies going into the theater.  I didn't know it was originally produced by the father of the zombie genre, George Romero.  And I didn't expect to see a movie about a sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell) with my own wife six months pregnant. Please note: this review contains spoilers.<br /><br />The movie starts out slowly.  In these stressful times, we're all too familiar with scenes of sudden gun violence in an idyllic setting.  After sheriff Dutton is forced to gun down a former town drunk on a little league field, the town of Ogden Marsh begins to unravel.  Everybody knows everybody else in this small town and a murder leaves emotional aftershocks that traumatize its citizens. This includes Dutton's wife, who happens to be the town doctor.<br /><br />The tension slowly notches up from there. These early moments are critical in establishing The Crazies as a superior horror film. The petty rivalries, the secret and not-so-secret grudges, the sadistic bullies - all of the townsfolk's deepest impulses are let loose through the TRIXIE virus, a military bioweapon that has accidentally (?) contaminated the town.<br /><br />Unlike so many other horror movies, Dutton and his deputy Clank (Joe Anderson) are precisely the people who should be dealing with an outbreak.  The problem is that they are little fish in a very big pond.  The movie quickly morphs from a slasher flick to survival horror when the military gets called in, loses control, and pulls out.<br /><br />What makes The Crazies so refreshing is that it plays on horror tropes, using it to narrative advantage.  We find out that the soldiers who are executing townsfolk aren't faceless, that the TRIXIE virus may or may not be transmitted through the water supply, and that taking one's temperature isn't a guaranteed means of identifying who's infected. The Crazies makes no promises but always delivers.<br /><br />This ambiguity may frustrate some people who expect everything to be wrapped in a neat bow, but director Breck Eisner knows that there is horror in uncertainty.  It's precisely this lack of clarity that makes the movie so good - the villains aren't unilaterally evil, the victims aren't always helpless, and the solutions aren't always moral.  The Crazies wallows in the gray area of harsh decisions, treating an outbreak with all the ethical gravity of a war.<br /><br />Let there be no doubt, this is as much a war movie as it is a horror movie. The real crazies, Eisner seems to say, is anyone who would trust authority. These days, that may not be such bad advice.<br /><br />P.S. Stay through the credits!</p></body></html>

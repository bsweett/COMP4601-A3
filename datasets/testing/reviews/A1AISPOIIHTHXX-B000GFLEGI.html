Well maybe not perfect but this film looks at films like the Resident Evil's, 28 Days Later, and the Dawn of the Dead remake and goes "step back and learn". So we have this film which may not be the most family fun, but rent with a few buddies and you'll have a good time, nothing more.<br /><br />I haven't watched the previous 3 so I can't comment on those. But in this one, many humans now live in cities with water on all sides and electrified fences all around. A team gets sent to get supplies now and then(why they don't just take them all at once is beyond me). Only something peculiar happens: one of the zombies, nicknamed Big Daddy can actually think, well sort of. It's more like a case of deductive reasoning and nothing more. He sees something and learns what it is, he goes "ooh, I see" and off we go.<br /><br />Part of the team is a man named Cholo, working for another man, THE man in the city. Only Cholo's not getting paid so for revenge he decides to hold the whole city for ransom or he'll fire missiles from a big truck known as Dead Reckoning. Sent by the man to get him is Riley, pretty much the designer of the truck. So it's basically a race to get the truck then turn around to save the city.<br /><br />If there's one thing you can count on in a zombie movie is gore and with this unrated edition, it's got it in spades. Faces' get pulled; tongues, arms and heads get ripped out; even a belly-button ring gets yanked out. If you're not into gore or can't stomach, stay away from this. There's a big gap where the "story" takes over but once zombies hit the city it's pretty much carnage right through.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not into horror films. Quite frankly, a lot of them are stupid and trying to do something which they're not doing in the end. Gore is meant to create disgust, a sense of "eww, did that head just get pulled off?" but what it's supposed to do is freak you the **** out. That's me so other people might find that freaky but me personally I like it when a horror film gets under my skin and creeps me out. Of course with a film like this, it's supposed to be carnage candy so you just go along with it.<br /><br />If you're big on horror, gore, or just the zombie films in general, you'll dig this. If you're like me who's into films like Seven or Aliens where the gore is more implied rather than shown in all it's glory well stay clear.</p></body></html>

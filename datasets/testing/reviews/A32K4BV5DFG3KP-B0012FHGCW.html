<meta name="summary" content="He's a little run away."></head><body><p>I very much liked the book Into the Wild, but somehow the movie misses what the book captured, it shows a very naive young man who acts very immature and insecure. I disliked how Chris was always shown running around and jumping off of ledges, overall it just reminded me of how a child acts. Also the way he acted around the hippie guy and also the Hal Holbrook character was very submissive and childlike. Chris was twenty five years old around these times it just really set me off the whole movie. I was really expecting to see Chris put his arms out like wings when he was running down the beach, and make an airplane noise. I really think that this movie could have been much better if Chris was presented in the right light. The book made him seem edgier rougher. For instance when the guy giving him a ride to the stampede gave him a ride ,asked if he had a hunting license, he said he did not need the F@$*ing government telling him to eat or not. Overall nice scenery somehow misses the character of a misunderstood man, comes up with an immature crybaby.</p></body></html>

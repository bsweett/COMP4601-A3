<meta name="summary" content="Glory"></head><body><p>Historical war drama about the Civil War battle at Antietam, and the formation of the first black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Voluntary Infantry. Glory is a masterful piece of work that will leave you breathless. Matthew Broddrick plays Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and performs him masterfully. Denzel Washington's performance was powerful as well. This movie stands as a great achievement, that could very well be called a classic.</p></body></html>

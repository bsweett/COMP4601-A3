<meta name="summary" content="An Incredible Blu Ray Boxed Set!"></head><body><p>I WOULD GIVE THIS RELEASE 10 STARS if Amazon allowed me to!<br /><br />Ben-Hur is one of my all time favorite films.  It is probably the single greatest performance ever given by Charlton Heston and the greatest epic ever filmed until the Lord of the Rings trilogy came along but still it holds it's head high and remains a timeless classic, just as good as it ever was, maybe better today!<br /><br />Much has been written about the film itself, so my review will just cover the actual Blu Ray presentation and the included extras.<br /><br />Many sets have been released with much ballyhoo and assorted trinkets and swag included in the box. Much of it is useless stuff you look at once, then put away and never see again. This is NOT the case with the Ben-Hur boxed set. Everything you get in this box set is of high quality and compliments the film itself.  Speaking of the box itself, it is a very VERY nice embossed keepsake box that is protected by an outer covering and when opened reveals the film along with two books. The three included discs are housed in a nice glossy fold out container with full color high quality printed photographs both inside and outside. The presentation is gorgeous, a real head turner.<br /><br />You get the film, Ben-Hur spread over two BD 50GB discs for maximum quality and zero compression artifacts and presented in it's original aspect ratio of 2.76:1. This is basically the widest of the wide screen formats, filmed in luscious 70mm with 65mm used for picture information and the remaining 5% used for the original 6 track magnetic soundtrack.  Ben-Hur was painstakingly restored, in fact it took them so much time that the actual 50th Anniversary of Ben-Hur was missed by a few years in order to provide us with the BEST picture and sound possible. Yes, we have all heard those words before, but in this case it is REALLY true!<br /><br />I have owned Ben-Hur on VHS and then all the various DVD releases. It has always lacked in the video quality department and I am happy to say that is no longer the case. This Blu Ray release of Ben-Hur gives us Bold  and Crisp NATURAL color (NO TEAL tint anyway in sight), NO signs of DNR, NO signs of edge enhancement , beautifully lush and focused cinematography that may even perhaps afford the home theater enthusiast with a better visual presentation than most theater goers got back in 1959.<br /><br />It is a 1959 film to be sure, but is is ALSO reference quality in every sense of the word. This is what REAL film looks like, no digital enhanced crapola! This is a beautifully filmed epic and the Blu Ray transfer faithfully represents the finished product from 1959, looking more like something filmed recently. The investment in both money and time by Warner Home Video was well worth it, showing all of us what Blu Ray releases COULD look like, if the proper care was shown prepping and transferring the original film elements.<br /><br />The time and money spent on restoring and rescanning Ben-Hur is obvious from the very beginning of the film. The resulting transfer is a singular achievement in home video entertainment. I have only a few negatives to mention, namely a few places that exhibit 'jump cuts' where a very small number of frames in a scene are missing or were damaged beyond repair and needed to be discarded to keep from spoiling the mostly pristine look of the rest of the film. At one point during the start of the big race I noticed a few white blips or print tear marks and an actual hair on the left side of the screen. I thought I imagined it so I went back and watched in slow motion. Yeah, they were there alright, but they were gone very quickly, never to return.  Luckily the audio does NOT suffer in these instances and there are very few OF them. This is NOT a transfer that in any way requires an apology (such as The Godfather, pt.1) or needs to be prefaced by saying "It looks good for the films age".  This IS a classic film from the tail end of Hollywood's Golden age, and as such has the look of a classic film. The color timing and lighting choices, the types of special effects used (no CGI back then) and the sometimes very noticeable dialogue looping are all byproducts of the way films were made then.  I guess what I am trying to say is this is NOT 100% perfect, but then again, no film is or ever was.  The only way Ben-Hur could look any better is to print this new scan at it's full resolution and then project it the old fashioned way.<br /><br />Even with a few missing frames I easily give Ben-Hur on Blu Ray 10 stars for the video quality alone!!!!<br />As a nice bonus this disc is NOT Java encumbered and as such your 'disc resume' feature WILL work, which is a boon for a title of this length if you can't sit still for the entire run time and need a few breaks.<br /><br />The audio is pretty much just as great as the picture. Presented in DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 , this might be the very best Ben-Hur has EVER sounded, then or now. Nothing gimmicky about the surrounds, the dialogue is perfectly rendered, no clicks, pops or blatant flaws, no screechy sounding music. During the big race the crowd sound effects coming from my rear surrounds were distorted a bit. This might have been how they were originally recorded but as the race progresses some elements of the audio mix suffer a bit, the louder things get, the more certain sounds break up. It isn't my system, I can blast the LOTR trilogy with no ill effects. You need a good ear and decent speakers to notice this, but for those that are picky I will admit that it is there.<br /><br />Also, for those with 'Golden Ears' you WILL hear the occasional hiss that the digital noise reduction didn't get rid of and you will also hear a bit of low frequency hum and rumble at times which sounds mechanical in nature to me but it is on the track and on the disc.  Most people will never notice it, but I tend to watch and listen with critical eyes and ears the first time around. All in all it is simply a stunning job of remixing and remastering the original magnetic sound elements.  Put this together with almost perfectly restored picture quality and you have an epic presentation of an epic film.  The good far outweighs the bad in regards to the sound.<br /><br />The Bonus features are superlative.  A keepsake quality book of glossy production photographs, an exact reproduction of Charlton Heston's personal production diary, two full length documentaries, screen tests, original movie trailers, a wonderful 'Music Only' track that highlights Miklos Rozsa's beautiful Oscar wining score , Newsreel footage and even Oscar Highlights from 1960 when Ben-Hur swept the awards with a record 11 Oscars, not topped EVER and not equaled until Titanic and then Lord of the Rings. Add to all this the original Silent version of Ben-Hur from 1925 and you have enough bonus features to fill all the chariots in the big race.<br /><br />This Ben-Hur Boxed set totally exceeded any and all my highest expectations.  The best presentation imaginable for one of the best films ever made. Ben-Hur (50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition) is a MUST OWN for all classic film lovers and fans of Charlton Heston.  I think it is THE BEST Blu Ray release of this year, easily outshining Star Wars and even the LOTR trilogy.  I cannot recommend it highly enough!<br /><br />WORD OF WARNING!!(contains spoilers)----  Make sure you hit the STOP button on your Blu Ray player IMMEDIATELY following the "The End" title card , otherwise you will be inexplicably treated to a censors approval screen from India and then directly into the FBI threatening to put you in prison if you bootleg or share your discs. It REALLY spoiled the mood I was in after such a wonderful movie and just a beautiful ending.  Judah Ben-Hur has his Mother and Sister back and Leprosy free, he got the girl, Masala was ripped apart and Judah Ben-Hur has just been converted to Christianity by Jesus (In Person!!),  The music swells to a crescendo and it says "The End" ..  Great! Then less than 10 seconds later you get this other weird stuff and I can't for the life of me figure out how this got past the disc authoring stage and onto my disc! GRRR! ANYWAY, you might wish to avoid that mood killer by remembering to hit STOP as soon as the end title card fades out. Like Gilda Radner liked to say, "It's always SOMETHIN'" !!</p></body></html>

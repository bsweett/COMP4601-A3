Limited Edition is the way to go!"></head><body><p>What prompted me to buy this movie is the fact that it had won 7 Oscars and it was listed on the American Film Institute's #11 best movies of all time.  There are two DVD versions in the market.  The regular version and the limited edition.  I opted for the latter despite the cost because if this is a &quot;very good movie&quot;, I wanted to be treated with whatever was on that second DVD and I'm happy to say that this is one hell of a movie!<p>I don't think today's movies can do what was done on &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.  It's even hard to believe that this movie was made with a two million dollar budget.  The movie is brilliant as it tackles two major storylines between two leaders Colonel Nicholson for the English and Colonel Saito for the Japanese.  Two fanatics + another (the commando / British Major) who comes later in the story.<p>The movie was brilliantly done and for a movie that was made in 1957, the video was very nice and it's letterboxed and in digital 5.1.  You can hear the insects and birds all around you. <p>After you are done with the movie, you are then treated with the nearly an hour documentary on the film which is filled with interesting tidbits such as the problems of making the film to learning how demanding the director was.  Very interesting.  Also, an appreciation of the film by John Milius (director of &quot;Big Wednesday).  The original B&amp;W featurette,  a short USC film narrated by William Holden, movie trailers for other movies by the Spiegel/Lean duo, cast information and more.  <p>This is an awesome DVD.  Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not quite the book"></head><body><p>The Empire is in trouble, so the government brings in some of the great heroes to help avert disaster.  In this twist on history, literary characters are real, and each of the characters in blended into one great story.  After reading the graphic novel, I was very excited about the movie, but I found myself disappointed with the retelling and rewriting.  What was wrong with the original?<p>The extras on the DVD discuss how Sean Connery was approached, and perhaps as a way to get him involved, the script was rewritten to take Mina Harker from her leadership role and replace her with Alan Quartermain.  Also, Quartermain, in this telling, is merely a retired adventurer rather than an opium fiend found in a back alley.<p>Because I had such high expectations, I was only mildly pleased with the movie.  Seeing each character fight his or her inner demons was interesting, but I couldn't stop comparing it to the book.  My wife, on the other hand, had not read the book and found it very exciting.  Although I would recommend seeing this, I would recommend reading the graphic novel more.</p></body></html>

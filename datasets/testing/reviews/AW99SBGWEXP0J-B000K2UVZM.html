<meta name="summary" content="The Black Dahlia"></head><body><p>LAPD detectives Bucky Bleichert (Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Eckhart) are partners.  They are working a child rape case when their path intersects with the murder of Elizabeth Shore (Kirshner).  Lee becomes obsessed with that case, and drags Bucky along for the ride.  The investigation leads Bucky to Madeline Linscott (Swank), and soon he is in a relationship he shouldn't be with a possible witness.  At the same time, sparks are flying with Lee's girlfriend, Kay (Johansson), but going down that path would be disastrous for his relationship with his partner.  As Bucky and Lee get closer to the truth, things get dangerous, and neither of them might have long left to live.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" is based on the novel by James Ellroy, and not the real-life unsolved mystery.  This gives the movie free reign to actually solve the case, but perhaps their treatment of the solution was better left unknown.  "The Black Dahlia" is a bit of a confusing mess.  Add to that poor acting, for the most part all around, and this is a film that does not live up to expectations.  Sure, it looks great, but that only goes so far.  I cannot recommend this film.</p></body></html>

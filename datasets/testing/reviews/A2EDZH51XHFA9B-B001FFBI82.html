It's not a soldiers-in-peacetime movie; either; it's about that period of "hurry up and wait" the we called Operation Desert Shield.<br /><br />Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a marine. No one, least of all him, knows why. ("I got lost on the way to college, sir!") He survives boot camp and, after some training, ships off to the desert for Desert Shield, where there was little to do but play tricks on reporters, watch war movies, and slowly go insane. Swofford and his seven teammates do a lot of all three.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this movie is, basically, about nothing, it's very well done. Mendes brings in some of the out-of-touch-with-reality vibe that made American Beauty such a fun movie and combines it with a very, very wrong humor. It's all the insanity of Apocalypse Now-- a film to which it wears its debt naked on its sleeve-- without all the things blowing up. Gyllenhaal is supported by a fine cast of others, including Jamie Foxx (who's really come into his own as a dramatic player), Peter Sarsgaard, and Evan Jones, who looks more like Flea with each passing day.<br /><br />Fun, even-- especially, perhaps-- if you're not a fan of war movies. *** ?</p></body></html>

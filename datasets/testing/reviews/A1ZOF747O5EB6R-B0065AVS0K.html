<meta name="summary" content="More Surreal Than Real"></head><body><p>"Sin City" is a comic book on a big screen.  Although played with real actors, the film definitely has a surreal edge where everything is larger than life.<br /><br />A synopsis of "Sin City" would probably be that all the violence, the plots and the characters cannot be believed at the end of the day.  Rather, the viewer is dwelling in the world of comics where heroes can take a terrible beating but still return for more and the characters are nastier, meaner and more unrelenting than could ever be the case in real life.<br /><br />I saw this film with my 18 year old son who believed it to be the most violent movie he had ever seen.  To an extent he was right although this ignores the fact that the characters were part of a modern world comic strip.  Once one adopts this mind set, the movie is more surreal than real.<br /><br />"Sin City" has large ensemble cast and is filmed mainly in monochrome.  Yet for every black and white image, there is always one piece of colour.  It may be a woman's eyes, it may be her dress or it may be the skin colour of a baddie.  On this scale, "Sin City" is a technical marvel than envelopes the viewer.  There can be few films released in the past year that both captivate and repel the viewer at the same time.</p></body></html>

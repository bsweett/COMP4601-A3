<meta name="summary" content="I, Boring"></head><body><p>I've seen this movie three times, and still can't force myself to like it. Frankly, it's boring. Will Smith looks bored, so does Bridget Moynahan (Sylvia Calvin) and Chi McBride. The "funny" one-liners are boring, too. The only person smiling in this production seems to be the robot, Sonny. And he's mostly animated! The movie is saved to some extent by the dramatic finale, when the robots come alive and try to take over the world (what else?). But not by much. Even during the finale, Smith and Moynahan look bored and boring! "I, Robot" ends with a cliff-hanger, implying that another revolution is in the air, this time led by the nice guy Sonny. But since there's no sequel, we're ultimately left with nothing at all...<br /><br />Two stars.</p></body></html>

Building on the momentum of the first film Director Bryan Singer continues to graft contemporary issues (although, to be fair, the original comic did so as well but not in such a compact fashion)to the X-men story. The major theme of the second feature, like the first, is prejudice and tolerance. Singer handles the themes and the film's story well. Although many of the original elements from the graphic novel involving Stryker have been changed, those changes work dramatically for the film. <p>When we last saw the X-Men, Wolverine had left Xavier's School For Gifted Children and the X-Men compound to discover his origin. He ends up at an abandoned research facility so it appears, on the surface, that his search has reached a dead end. Rogue mutants have become bolder making an attempt on the life of the President. This assassination attempt allows William Stryker the opportunity and excuse he needs to convince the President to sign an order giving him troops to invade Xavier's school and take the X-Men (and the children at the school)captive. <p>Encased in a plastic prison cell, Magneto is a caged bird. When Stryker arrives with a special serum to force Magneto to cooperate in revealing information about Xavier's school and the compound, Magneto sings giving up his old friend to a mutual enemy. <p>Jean Grey's abilities have blossomed in a frightening way since her encounter with Magneto at Ellis Island. Her abilities indicate that she might be more powerful than ever before. She and Storm go in search of the Presidential assassin so they can get to the bottom of who is trying to create a war between humans and mutants. Meanwhile, Stryker attacks Xavier's compound and with Wolverine the only adult around, he goes into high gear fighting them off. All of this becomes central to the conflict between Stryker, Magneto and the X-Men. <p>The performances are all exceptional in particular Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Famke Jannsen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Brian Cox give considerable power and presence to the various roles they play. Unlike some films, the actors here are clearly committed to the material and aren't going through the motions. <p>The DVD looks exceptional although I did notice a bit of edge enhancement. Still, it's nothing serious and doesn't mar an otherwise exceptional presentation. The colors are rich and, unlike the film the Santa Clause (another recent release)the transition from one layer to another in the disc isn't disruptive. <p>The extras are an improvement when compared to the first edition of X-Men on DVD (and comparable to 1.5). On disc one there are two running commentaries with Bryan Singer, Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and a second audio track with various comments from a variety of the actors and producers. <p>Disc two focuses on a wide variety of extras. The Nighcrawler Attack sequence is a multi-angle interactive sequence that is actually quite cool although I doubt you'll go back to it again and again. The Wolverine/Deathstrike Fight Rehearsal provides the nuts and bolds of choregraphing a difficult and demanding fight sequence. The documentary The Second Unanny Issue of X-Men (cleverly titled I might add) is quite good and provides a good glimpse into the production process. It's not the best documentary I've seen included as an extra but provides considerable insight.<p>The Featurettes include The Secret Origin of X-Men, Nightcrawler Reborn, The Adventure Before X2, Introducing The Incredible Nightcrawler and character studies. As before there are deleted scenes although I haven't had the time to investigate all of these fully so can't completely comment. <p>Parents should be warned that there is a bit of bad language and also some suggestive sexual situations in the film.</p></body></html>

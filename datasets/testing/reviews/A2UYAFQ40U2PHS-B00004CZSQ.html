<meta name="summary" content="Argento's greatest..."></head><body><p>This film is utterly amazing to look at.  Dario Argento was a master at these kind of films from 1975 to 1987.  During that time, he made 6 films, several of which are masterpieces.  This is his signature film, the only that he will always be known for.  It's a worthy film to be known for.  It's one of the most terrifying films you'll ever see.  Seeing it letterboxed on DVD is the 2nd best way to see it.  I would love to see it in a theater (it was shot in 2.35:1).  It was shot on 3 strip Technicolor stock, which is why the colors are so vibrant and startling.  It was one of the last films to be shot on the old Technicolor stock (the same stock used for The Wizard of Oz).  The film's plot really doesn't make a lick of sense, but the visuals are utterly amazing.  Most of Argento's films have the same plots.  An English/American artist of some kind goes to Italy and gets involved in a murder mystery.  But his visuals overpower his stale plots.  The music by Goblin (who scored several Argento works) is one of the most amazing soundtracks in film history.  Argento made a few more masterpieces after this (Inferno and Phenomena), but this was his peak, and he's never come close to repeating or surpassing it.  This is a masterpiece...</p></body></html>

I can never believe what the movie showed me. It depicted that the Cruise, the professional assasin could not kill Jamie the taxi driver!<br /><br />At  the end, the dialogue was so childish that it's unbearable! Cruise said to Jamie "I was just trying to make a living!" before trying to kill Jamie. But it turned out Cruise was killed by Jamie! On top of that, there's no suspense at all.<br /><br />No wonder it's a big flop at the box office. This is one of the worst movies starring Tom Cruise. Save your money on this one.</p></body></html>

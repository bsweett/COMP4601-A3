I heard a lot of &quot;buzz&quot; about it, therefore heightening my curiosity.  I begged my mom to let me watch it.  She always said &quot;no&quot;.  It took two years for her to finally say &quot;yes&quot;.  I rented it that day.  After I watched it, I realized it was worth the wait.<p>&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is a work of genius.  Who knew that a thriller can contain such level of quality?  The writers have a very creative mind as expressed in this movie.  Few other movies can chain an unusual chain of events and an unusual personality and make it fit so perfectly.  It blends with the rest of the movie smoothly.  This movie was well-deserving of all five Oscar wins, including Best Picture.  However, it should have won more.<p>Anthony Hopkins was terrific in his Oscar winning role as the infamous imprisoned serial killer Hannibal Lector.  This is his best acting in his career.  Jodie Foster was the perfect casting choice for her Oscar winning role as the determined FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling.  Their chemistry is perfect, even with a glass wall between them.  The role of &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; by Ted Levine is wonderful.  <p>Every scene will keep one watching closely guessing what will happen next.  Therefore, one can watch it everyday for twelve years and still find new reasons to love it.  Though, those who are offended by graphic violence and images may be disturbed by certain scenes.  Those who are not will have no problem discovering why &quot; The Silence of the Lambs&quot; will be a classic.  Of the Hannibal Lector trilogy, this is the best.</p></body></html>

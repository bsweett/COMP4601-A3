His father was killed a few years earlier, and Norton is a very angry and bitter person now.  His behavior is tearing apart the family, and he soon gets arrested for murder.  While in jail, he changes his views and no longer wants to be a skin-head in the neo-nazi group.  When he getys out of prison, he leaves the group and everyone turns against him.  He's in all kinds of trouble then.  This movie is very powerful and the performances are just incredible.  I highly reccomend you see it.  It's a little disturbing at times, but it's very moving.</p></body></html>

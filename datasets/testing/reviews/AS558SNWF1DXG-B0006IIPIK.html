<meta name="summary" content="What's this? A multimillion dollar Guy Maddin movie? Cool!"></head><body><p>This is an extremely anachronistic yarn that reminds me of a Guy Maddin movie for two reasons.<br /><br />It borrows the colors, camera angles, whipes, dissolves, designs and tone of an old German expressionist movie and it also seems to be specifically for people who love film and can identify the homages being paid here. I'm not sure why they did it, exactly, but I'm glad they did and I'm glad they dove in, unapologetically, and made this beautifully artificial machine that has heaps of heart and humor, even if the heart exists entirely in binary code.<br /><br />"Sky Captain" also pays great nods to the old Superman matinee cartoons, Orson Welles and both "Indiana Jones" and the myriad influences that made Indy possible in the first place.<br /><br />A strange and wonderful experiment that won't be for everyone but that manages to outweigh its indulgence with sheer stylistic audacity. Oh, and it's also a lot of fun.</p></body></html>

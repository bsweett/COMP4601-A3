The opening begins with a riot and a group of animal right activists taking monkeys out of an experimental lab. But, what they don't know about the monkeys is that they are infected with a virus that makes a person into a crazed cannibal, or has they are really known as zombies. The main character, Jim, played by Cillian Murphy, who is a bike courier who wakes up at a hospital 28 days after the virus was released. He went into the hospital to have brain surgery before the virus was released because when he was delivering a package when he ended up in the hospital. When he goes around the city, he goes into a church and wakes up some zombies. Then he runs into two survivors, Selena, played by Naomie Harris, and Mark, played by Noah Huntley, who saves him from the zombies that were chasing him down one of the streets in the city. They go to Jim's house and that is where Mark gets infected and Selena kills him. When walking to a safe haven, Jim and Selena sees Christmas lights that are signaling any uninfected survivors to come up there for safety. While trying to get there, Zombies appear. Jim and Selena run from them, then, thanks to Frank and his daughter, Hannah, they were safe. The next day, they hear a broadcast on Frank's handradio to come to Manchester to get away from the zombies. On the way, in a tunnel, they, in Frank's taxi, climb over cars in order to get to Manchester. One of the tires popped and Frank and Hannah had to change the tire. And in there, see rats running from the zombies and that is when they rush to get the tire on in time before they are near them. They get out of there, but, later, Frank is infected by a drop of blood. And that's when they are spotted by a group of soldiers run by Major Henry West, played by Christopher Eccleston. During that time, it is when Jim, Selena, and Hannah discover that the real monsters aren't the zombies, but the soldiers themselves. The ending is too good for words, but I am not going to tell you anymore of this excellent zombie movie. Danny Boyle's directing is extremely brilliant, Cillian Murphy as Jim is smart and intelligent and heartwarming as well as Naomie Harris' Selena is. Brendan Gleeson's performance is extremely heartwarming and emotional as Frank, the grief-stricken father of Hannah. Megan Burns' performance as Hannah is excellent without compromise. But the performance that takes the prize is Christopher Eccleston's. His performance as the crazy Major Henry West is an remarkable performance for a villain ever. John Murphy's score for the movie is encouraging and smart at its best. The production design, the costume design, the visual/make-up effects, the cinematography, the editing is extremely well done at its best just like the rest of the movie is. Go see this movie now in theatres almost everywhere near you! You will surely enjoy it.</p></body></html>

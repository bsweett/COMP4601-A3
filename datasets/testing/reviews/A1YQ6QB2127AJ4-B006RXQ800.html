Had he started any sooner, it may not have resulted so magical.  The special effects and the art direction are amazing.  Who knew that so much blood could be so magical?<p>  Daniel Day-Lewis deserved his Oscar nomination for this role.  He never loses his character for one second.  Leonard DiCaprio made an amazing comeback with this film, which he was dissed for the Oscar, as was Cameron Diaz.  She proves that thieves can be emotional(this can only happen on screen).  For that, I expected her to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress before the nominations were released.<p>  "Gangs of New York" may also be a history lesson of how the Irish and other immigrants/minorities had to fight oppression in the 1800's.  If you are sensitive to graphic violence/war scenes, you may want to choose another movie.  Otherwise, you will be very satisfied of Martin Scorcese's outcome.</p></body></html>

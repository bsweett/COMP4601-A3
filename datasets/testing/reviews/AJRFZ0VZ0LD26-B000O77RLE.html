<meta name="summary" content="Another fine Clint Eastwood direction"></head><body><p>It is a treat to have Clint Eastwood deliver his latest piece of work.  "Letters of Iwo Jima" is shot in black and white and it is one of the finest war movies since "Schindler's List" that was made in the same style.  It is also a foreign movie, shot entirely in Japanese language. This is a story of WWII in Pacific, made entirely from the Japanese soldier's point of view.  These soldiers are just like any other.  They are dedicated to their country, their duty to their emperor and honor towards their fellow countrymen.  They are lonely, concerned about their families and their future.  Human nature and character trancends any morality tales.  Eastwood is not lecturing us here.  He is just showing us that no matter where people come from some are noble, some are not; some are decent and some are not.  However, Eastwood manages to make them feel human, strong and vulnerable at the same time. An absolute gem - must see movie.</p></body></html>

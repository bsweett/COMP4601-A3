<meta name="summary" content="One of the all around bad movies this year"></head><body><p>There's a scene in the original Halloween where through the camera's POV complete with holes functioning as our eyes, we follow a figure walk through a house, grab a knife and proceed upstairs to viciously attack a young girl only for it at the end to be a young boy in a clown mask. Later he grows into an unstoppable killing machine that stalks and terrorizes comes after you and no bullet or knife can stop him. It was that feeling of an evil that would continously coming after you that made "the Shape" such a memorable horror icon. Apparently that notion was lost on Rob Zombie who thought that clearly we need an explanation as to why he'd be such a monster (beware of hick families is the message here) and not only from a story standpoint but from a filmmaking one as well, the new Halloween just hits all the wrong notes - no pun intended, Mr. Zombie - the whole time.<br /><br />Michael Myers is a seriously disturbed young boy growing up with a promiscuous sister, a controlling father figure and a stripper mother who at least tries to help. But after viciously killing his family, save his mother, Michael is institutionalized under care of Dr. Samuel Loomis. But 15 years pass and Michael escapes and makes his way back to his home of Haddonfield where he tries to track down his baby sister, Laurie.<br /><br />Whereas "the Shape" of 1978 liked to appear in the shadows, ominously watching teenagers unaware to his presence, this new guy likes to just mindlessly bash stuff in and be as loud as possible (he's like one of those hulking brutes with the deep voice and lack of intelligence that school bullies have for protection) and this practically sucks the suspense right from the film. Remember that scene where Michael sits right up behind Laurie who doesn't see him? Nothing like that here. Not to mention the gaps in the story like the lack of trick-or-treaters, Michael's seemingly psychic knowledge of Laurie's school schedule, her present appearance, much less her name. Then of course there's things in the filmmaking spectrum like out-of-focus shots, out-of-character decisions and dialogue, continuity errors like crazy and just strange cuts (in one scene, Laurie is behind hauled away by Michael kicking and screaming and in the next shot, she's passed out being carried off by Michael. Uh, did he punch her out?) With the Zombie trademark of characters swearing with reckless abandon, and I might add, zero creativity, this Halloween version is just unfortunate.<br /><br />As far as casting is concerned, the Samuel Loomis of this one, played by Malcolm Macdowell is a good one and the young boy playing Michael is good as well while the rest either overact, don't act enough or just not simply given nothing to do. The new Laurie, played by Scout Taylor-Compton, is easy on the eyes but she almost seems to be given one direction: be cute and scream your face off when the terror starts. The casting is just one of many a problem that the film faces and quite simply, there's just not enough to recommend.<br /><br />In all good seriousness, I just can't recommend this. Sure it does stand out from Carpenter's original and not just a clone and the idea of exploring the evil sounds like a good idea but this is just one unfortunate business of a film.</p></body></html>

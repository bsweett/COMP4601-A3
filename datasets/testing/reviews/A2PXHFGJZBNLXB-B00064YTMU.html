<meta name="summary" content="Above-average film works as thriller and two-character study"></head><body><p>COLLATERAL, director Michael Mann's most recent film, is not only a nail-bitingly tense thriller (especially in its final half hour), but also a fascinating study of two characters, contract killer Vincent (Tom Cruise) and cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx), who, as screenwriter Stuart Beattie subtly and slyly reveals, had grander ambitions as younger men but have had to settle for something much less. Max, especially, has dreams of eventually owning his own limo service and striking it rich---but he's been dreaming about that for the twelve years he's been driving a cab.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film a lot, but I will concede that I probably liked it more for its ambition than for its execution. To be hypercritical, for example, I suppose that in the end this human angle to the characters---the conversations Vincent and Max have while the latter is taken hostage by the former take on existentialist, "what-is-our-purpose-in-life" tones, though never as pretentious or preachy as it may sound---doesn't really lead anywhere, that they're all just little details to add spice to what is otherwise a rather standard thriller. The moody final shots of the film, for me, don't sum up any of the character themes Mann throws into the picture, as fraught with meaning as they outwardly seem.<br /><br />Still, better to have involving human characters that spout convincing dialogue rather than just another high-tech thriller with loud shootouts and bombastic chase scenes to cover for a neglect for the human factor. And it helps that the performances are, for the most part, quite effective. In the case of Jamie Foxx, it is much more than that. His touching performance as Max truly brings sympathy to his character, who is not only Vincent's victim but perhaps a victim of his own delusions of grandeur. (In a few small ways, I think Foxx's quiet, unassuming turn here might be slightly more memorable than his more outwardly impressive portrayal of Ray Charles in the recent RAY.) As for Tom Cruise, I was generally able to accept him as the steely bad guy Vincent, but a better actor might have brought more convincing menace and gravitas to the role. Still, Cruise pulls off this casting-against-type reasonably well...and besides, now that I think about it, perhaps COLLATERAL is more about Max than it is about Vincent. Who doesn't dream big against all reason once in a while? Max is who we relate to in this film, who we root for, who really involves us emotionally.<br /><br />In short, COLLATERAL may not be a truly great film, but it is a good one that works as an effective suspense thriller and as a character study. These two sides may not totally mesh together to produce a convincing whole vision, but I would take this kind of ambitious, intelligent movie over a soulless Hollywood thriller "product" any day.

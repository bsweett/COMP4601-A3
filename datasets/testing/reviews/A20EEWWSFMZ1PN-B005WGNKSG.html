This brings him to the attention of Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube). Henrik is receiving packages from the person who probably killed his niece, Harriet. Therefore, he hires Mikael to track down and find out what actually happened to Harriet. With piles of old data and Mikael is still stumped and does not know where to turn to find the answer. He gets his help and answers from an unexpected source Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) a girl with the appearance of a punk rocker and bearing The Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />The only social redeeming value of this film is now I have learned how to cuss in Swedish. I also took notes on things I did not know you could do. I do not consider myself a prude however I believe this film was excessively graphic for the telling of the story. The film is very slow paced and makes you want to have the type of player that you can listen too when it is in fast forwarded mode. In addition, there is an annoying background theme plays over and over and over throughout the complete film. The film does stick to a generic formula, throws in the standard red herrings, and twist at the end no big surprises but it is what we expect.<br /><br />For people interested in media I watched the Blu-ray version only and it has an option for English voiceover. The voiceover is easier to follow but sounds like a voiceover being read. The DVD has many by-passable coming attractions. There are the standard DVD extras that we have come to expect.<br />Theatrical trailer<br />Family tree (a single slide)<br />Interview with Noomi (her accent seems more British)<br />TGWPWF Sneak Previews<br />Previews</p></body></html>

However, I gave Dark Water a second chance and I'm so glad I did! Dahlia is a woman with problems, and this movie lets you make up your own mind whether they are psychological or paranormal. I personally feel like it was a combination of both. This movie just gets better and better every time I watch it. I truly feel like Jennifer Connelly is this generation's best actress, and I feel she's so underrated.</p></body></html>

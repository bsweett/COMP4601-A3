<meta name="summary" content="`Superman' doesn't leap over its own self-constructed tall buildings"></head><body><p>With `Batman's revived success and the ongoing small-screen success of `Smallville', the producers of this movie must have thought now was an opportune time to revive the `Superman' movie franchise.<br /><br />The last `Superman' movie was made in the 1980's. In that era, the Internet still was confined to government agencies, cell phones were extremely bulky contraptions only for the `super' wealthy alone, and the Cold War still existed.<br /><br />This screenplay attempted a tremendous feat of going back in time to an era, essentially before the last two movies were even made.<br /><br />Unfortunately doing this made Clark Kent into a very inept `nerd'. Because he is now effectively established in pop culture as `good looking' in his own right, Singer really should not have tampered with `Clark Kent'----instead leaving him as Dean Cain and Tom Welling  effectively reconfigured this part of the legend in public consciousness.<br /><br />Since Brandon Routh is a pretty decent looking guy himself, better `Clark' character development easily could have highlighted his own sex appeal throughout this entire film ultimately without alienating audiences. Even the earlier Christopher Reeves and George Reeves interpretations wanted their audiences to come away liking `Clark' as much as 'Superman'; Clark isn't supposed to be the buffoon leaving viewers wondering how he even got the Daily Planet's attention. .<br /><br />Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) having a kid is admittedly off cannon, but I've seen deeper goofs on television. It's an interesting proposition though: can Clark now be a parent to the same kid that he briefly fathered while a non-kryptonian but then never met until just now? Because he gets presented as the 'good guy' this technical revelation of Superman/Clark Kent as 'the absentee father' is a novel plot twist!<br /><br />Less convincing is Lois's relationship with Perry White's nephew, I've never ever heard of him until now! Plus, the idea that she would just happen to fall in love with the boss's relative is too coincidental for my tastes. Not to mention Lois herself--who does not either look or act like the big city investigative reporter whom I attempted to emulate with some success in a college newsroom!<br /><br />Singer obviously took advantage of the advanced special effects capabilities and set designs since the 1980's, so having 'Clark' and other characters walk around in (what I presume is an attempt at) 'classic' wear just makes them look like they are obvious actors on an obvious movie set. I understand that both this screenplay's writer and director wanted to pay tribute to Christopher Reeve and his time in the title role, but they also needed to have decided what era they were setting this movie in, and then STICK WITH IT!<br /><br />There is a reason why Routh looks much better--not to mention more comfortable--decked out in the 'Superman' outfit as opposed to his 'Clark' clothes. If he himself appears so uncomfortable in the latter character, why should audiences ourselves be comfortable with that role--who ultimately is the real person while Superman is the powers according to this script?<br /><br />Sure, there are highlights in this film--Kevin Spacey plays a delicious 'Lex Luthor' and  archive footage of  Marlon Brando as 'Jor-El' reminds audiences of the additional reasons why the first 'Superman' movies WERE awesome blockbusters.  However, this particular screenplay itself is obviously a case of not having completely thought through how to implement a `great idea'. Thinking projects completely through is always essential to ensuring they are a `super' success.</p></body></html>

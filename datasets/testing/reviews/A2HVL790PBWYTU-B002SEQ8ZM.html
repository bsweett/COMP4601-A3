<meta name="summary" content="those creepy, creepy button eyes that are way creepy"></head><body><p>To be honest, Neil Gaiman's novel left me a bit cold and not at all invested in the lead character of Coraline. This is one of those pretty rare instances in which I prefer the film adaptation to the original literary source. Because Coraline may still be not be as endearing as Dorothy Gale or Pippi Longstocking or even Helena from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BT97AO">Mirrormask</a> (also written by Gaiman), but at least the stop-motion animation looks absolutely cool and bizarre. CORALINE the film conveys the same uneasy and feverish vibe that was so palpable in the book, and I wouldn't be at all surprised that little kids upon seeing this movie end up with nightmares. The quick premise breakdown: a lonely little girl wanders thru a hidden door and finds a better version of her life. But is it really a better version?<br /><br />The sense I got is that her parents are so distracted and neglectful that they couldn't even work up the energy to give her a proper name. Michigan girl Coraline Jones with her blue hair and her folks have just now moved into the Pink Palace Apartments and she doesn't waste time in exploring her new home. And what an odd home it is. Coraline soon runs into fellow tenants, an acrobatic foreign old gent perfecting a mice act and two seriously dog-loving old spinsters dwelling in the basement apartment. There's a mangy cat who knows more than it lets on. And then there's that peculiar door that's been painted over... and we know, don't we, that it won't take long at all before Coraline finds out what's on the other side of that door?<br /><br />What she finds on the other side is a spooky length of tunnel which leads into a fantastic alternate world, and this world apes Coraline's new digs. But what's disturbing is that Coraline promptly encounters creepy mimics of her parents and neighbors. Instead of immediately perturbed, Coraline is instead equally bemused and enchanted because this set of parents, this Other Mother and Other Father, is fun and caring and attentive, showering Coraline with love and mouth-watering dishes and treating her to marvelous magical sights. Except that these parents have buttons sewn into their eye sockets. And then Coraline runs into warped counterparts of her real world neighbors, and even a version of that annoying kid Wybie (short for Wyborn). But everything seems so perfect and idyllic in this other dimension, and Coraline is so gratified to be the center of attention for once that she dismisses the worrying fact that people in this place HAVE FRIGGIN' BUTTONS FOR EYES! Inevitably, though, the doubts start to set in. And if she's not careful, Coraline may find herself forever trapped on the wrong side of the door.<br /><br />Henry Selick, director of CORALINE, also directed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas (2-Disc Collector's Edition + Digital Copy)</a>, and don't be surprised at how similar these two films are in terms of the surreal and exaggerated and unsettling animation. I dunno, to me, there's just something so fundamentally disquieting and macabre about people with buttons for eyes. The film also features wistful ghosts of dead children, victims of the Other Mother. And adding to the colorful parade of grotesque, we learn that the two nice old ladies, as nice as they are, tend to stuff their dead pets.<br /><br />It took a while for me to warm up to Coraline Jones. She's a little mean and peevish, and she's not too nice to that kid Wybie. But she did win me over in the end as she demonstrates gumption when things take an alarming turn, and it doesn't hurt that Dakota Fanning provides the vocal talent. Meanwhile, Teri Hatcher does double duty as the Other Mother and also Coraline's real mom. CORALINE may not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy - in fact, it may throw you off your comfort zone - but it's certainly worth watching, for its memorable twisty visuals and its spindly, wildly imaginative characters. The glaring theme is parental neglect, but you can also draw out a pretty classic adage: "There's no place like home." Even if home is someplace as garish-sounding as the Pink Palace Apartments.<br /><br />Creepy button eyes. Ugh.</p></body></html>

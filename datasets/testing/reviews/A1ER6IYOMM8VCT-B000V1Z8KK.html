<meta name="summary" content="ENTERTAINING AND TOTALLY ABSORBING ACTION FILM!"></head><body><p>Another well thought out action/thriller film from 'Antoine Fuqua'(Training Day). This film will keep you interested for it's 2 hour running length. One of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time. The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some interesting extras.</p></body></html>

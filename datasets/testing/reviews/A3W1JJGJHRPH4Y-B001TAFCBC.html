<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Concept"></head><body><p>There is much to recommend the movie. The plot is simple: boy meets girl. How the movie tells the story is complicated. The plot line folds in on itself. It reveals bits and pieces of the relationship slowly and sometimes you have to put a piece somewhere else than where you originally placed it in the jigsaw puzzle of their relationship. This makes the movie interesting to watch. In this respect it is like "Memento." Carey and the other actors do a good job. Carey plays a lonely loner in this movie very well.<br /><br />The plot device is the memory erase. A doctor comes up with a method to erase all memories of a relationship. What the movie points out very well,using Carey's relationships and subplots, is that memories of even bad relationships should be valued and erasing memories does not really solve any thing in your life.<br /><br />I did not give the movie five stars because I was not engaged in the relationship. There is an emotional center in the movie, but it really did not interest me. I could care less whether Carey's character and Winslett's character have a successful relationship. Maybe it is just me, but you see much of the bad parts of the relationship before you see the good so it is hard to be a cheerleader for this relationship to work.<br /><br />I recommend the movie; however, it did not overwhelm me. Maybe I expected too much, because I liked the director's other works so much.</p></body></html>

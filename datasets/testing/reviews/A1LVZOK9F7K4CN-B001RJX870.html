<meta name="summary" content="Life inside the bunker..."></head><body><p>I believe that this is the first German film to deal with the problem of Hitler.  Independent/Foreign Film icon, Bruno Ganz, gives one of his best performances as the increasingly insane Fuhrer.  Hitler, in this movie, is human and frail, but still a monster.  His random acts of kindness are all the more grotesque.  Even at the end, he congratulates himself on his courage in dealing with "the Jewish problem."<br /><br />The movie is book-ended with clips of Hitler's real-life secretary, who appears as a young girl in the film.  Most of the movie is seen through her eyes - from her first job interview with Hitler at the age of twenty-two, to the final days in the bunker.<br /><br />The movie feels so authentic it is almost a docu-drama.  A series of titles at the end shows what happened to each of the characters - a surprising number of them led incredibly long lives.  We get to meet most of the characters in the bunker, which seems like a version of Hell.  The most illuminating character is Eva Braun: she actually has a feisty personality.  What does she see in Hitler?  What, in fact, does anyone see in Hitler?  At a time when he is clearly insane, commanding make-believe armies, and doing everything wrong, his supporters cling to him all the stronger, as if he were capable of leading them away from this horror.</p></body></html>

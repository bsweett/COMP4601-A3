<meta name="summary" content="Is nature benevolent or cruel?"></head><body><p>Timothy Treadwell spent 13 years among grizzly bears in Alaska with his video camera before he was killed by one of them.  A recovering alcoholic who never fit in human society, he found meaning living with the bears, whom he loved for the romantic characteristics that he projected upon them.  He saw the bears as beautiful and authentic and believed that he had a genuine connection with them.<br /><br />How ironic and interesting that the filmmaker who presents and shapes his footage is Werner Herzog.  Treadwell captures Herzog's sympathy because his crazy obsession to confront nature is so similar to that of many Herzog protagonists in other films.  Yet, where Treadwell saw beauty, Herzog sees only cruelty and chaos.  Nevertheless, he seems to respect Treadwell's compulsion and presents his story with great sympathy.  He also admires Treadwell as a filmmaker, and we are treated to many extraordinary images.  After listening to the tape that recorded the deaths of Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard, he tells the woman who owns the tape, a close friend of Treadwell's, that she must destroy it and never listen to it.  This is far more affecting and dramatic than any voyeuristic thrill the viewer might get from actually hearing the horrible sounds.  This is an extraordinary and unusual nature documentary.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Requiem for a Dream (2000)"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that everyone should see, but most people won't like. In fact, there's not a lot to like, because the movie is about four likable people falling deep into desperation and despair. The dream mentioned in the title is the American Dream of making it, of having it all, of acheiving your goals. But these people, Harry and his mother Sara, Marion, and Tyrone, all try to acheive their goals in the most dangerous ways. Watching these four change into shadows of themselves is depressing. All said and done though, this is still one of the best movies I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

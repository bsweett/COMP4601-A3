<meta name="summary" content="A seasonal Christmas classic"></head><body><p>This is a collection of tales as they are recollected by a person thinking back on their childhood one Christmas. It has all the exaggerations with its ups and downs.<br /><br />Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) spots a "Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB" 200-shot Carbine with compass, in the window of a story and fantasizes on how to get it for Christmas.<br />Will he succeed?<br />And if so will he shoot his eye out?<br /><br />I had one of those Davie Crocket hats when I was a kid. There were lots of other items and actions that I could relate to. However my wife likes the watering method used by Melinda Dillon (mother) around the trophy. And she likes the way the mother conserved electricity by turning it off. I could see her snickering through the corner of my eye. I am not sure I should have bought this movie. It may prove fatal to any window plans.<br /><br />The sequel of "A Christmas Story" ("It Runs in the Family" [1994]) lacks a lot of the originality of this one.</p></body></html>

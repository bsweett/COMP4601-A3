I've never been so happy to be wrong.  Mostow did an incredible job meeting the high expectations that fans have for this series.<p>I'm not going to talk about the plot for fear of revealing too much, but I will say that this is the movie where John Connor finally meets his destiny.  This is where the questions and issues of a time paradox (ex: If Judgment Day never happened how did John's father come back in time?  Would he never have existed?) are finally answered (intelligently I might add).<p>And of course, Arnold (or Governor Arnold now I guess) absolutely IS the Terminator.  I don't think I have EVER seen a role more perfectly cast.<p>If there I had any complaints at all, it was mostly just for what I felt I was missing then anything.  I never thought I'd say this about an action movie, but I really wish there was a bit more dialogue and characterization for John Connor.  As I said before, this is THE MOMENT when he becomes the man he was destined to be.  I would have LOVED just a couple of extra minutes to watch him make the transition into the role.  <p>I'm holding out hope that extra footage will be added to the DVD.  I really got the impression that T3 was made with a strict eye on the clock.  The first two Terminator movies are around two hours (more for T2), T3 clocked in for almost exactly an hour and a half, if I remember right.  I honestly think that a lot was left on the cutting room floor; I'd love to see some of it integrated back into the movie.<p>Again, 4 out of five stars.  A very solid third entry into this wonderful sci-fi saga.</p></body></html>

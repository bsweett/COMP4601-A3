<meta name="summary" content="awesome western!"></head><body><p>The theme song to this movie still sends chills down my spine! This gritty tale was one of several that set the bar for great westerns. Clint Eastwood didn't have to be muscle bound or loud to be a convincing 'tough hombre'. And of course, who could forget the wicked 'Angel Eyes'? The movie also incorporates some of the horrors of the Civil War era while we focus on the quest for hidden gold. Who will get to the cached gold in the graveyard first?<br /><br />Chrissy K.

<meta name="summary" content="Very good film, Steve Buscemi should have been nominated"></head><body><p>Very good film, being Quentin Tarantino's film debut. Sadly, this film didn't get nomianted for an Oscar, but either Steve Buscemi, Lawernce Tierney or Tim Roth should have been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor. Can you believe there is only ONE woman in this film? But, who cares.<br /><br />This DVD has both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the movie, and only the widescreen version has DTS sound. The director himself makes a few apperances as Mr. Brown. But the first disc has five deleted scenes, inculding two alternate angles of the bloody "EAR" scene, one which is more graphic than the other. But, the more graphic angle when Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) slices off the ear, he's HOLDING the ear while he PRETENDS to slice it off! No wonder that angle wasn't in the film.<br /><br />Overall rating: 7/10</p></body></html>

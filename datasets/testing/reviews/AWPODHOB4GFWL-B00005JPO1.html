<meta name="summary" content="Looks Great/Sounds Great - Plot Suffers Terribly"></head><body><p>Let me be very fair by stating that this film is beautifully recreated in Blu-Ray with all the special effects and sound seemingly amplified!  It's a beauty!<br /><br />However, the fourth installment of "Indiana Jones" is a disappointment.  The entrance scene with Indiana and his fedora in a silhouette is a nice start, but the film's plot quickly disintegrates into implausibility.  Now, I do understand the Saturday `Flash Gordon' type stories where credibility is stretched for entertainment, but this film stretches and breaks.  Marion is back (Karen Allen) and her entrance is so very welcome, but she soon disappears into a one-dimensional character.  Indiana's new side-kick (Shia LaBeouf) misses his mark and only annoys when constantly slicking back his hair (thanks to George Lucas).  John Hurt is such a great actor, it hurts to see him delegated to barely speaking, but his face tells a lot more than the dialogue around him.  Cate Blanchett is thoroughly believable as the commie villain, but her character is also `dumbed-down'.<br /><br />The action scenes are not as inventive as previous Indiana Jones films (remember the first 15 minutes of "Temple of Doom" from the dance number, "Anything Goes" to jumping out a three-story building to a car chase to jumping out of a plane in a raft to sliding down a snow peaked glacier to dropping off a cliff into a wild raging river and on and on...?)  There is nothing like that here.  There is a floating car with our heroes that goes over numerous gigantic waterfalls and no one gets hurt (only a little wet).  The car chase scene on the cliff never gets too exciting and to see LaBeouf swinging on vines ala Tarzan is just TOO much to have the audience believe.  Do I need to add the scene where Indy survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator that is blown a mile away?  And finally, I apologize, but the "Close Encounters" ending is fairly dramatic, but with all that torrential water gushing, mountains collapsing and the winds hurling around the characters, why don't their clothes or hair move at all?  It is the most egregious CGI overlook since George Lucas ("Return Of The Jedi") had Mark Hamill fly through the redwood forest on the air-scooters and the ferns didn't move at all.<br /><br />Like I said, I tried to be fair.  It is still a great film compared to most that is out there.  But when Lucas and Spielberg set the bar SO high with previous works, they can't top themselves and that hurts - kind of like growing up and realizing your heroes are really ordinary people.  But it's still worth watching (or owning), if only for its historical significance and the beautifully filmed scenery (in Blu-Ray!!!)  Get the first three in Blu-Ray as well (when available).  The difference will make the films seem like new!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superior action flick from DIE HARD director John McTiernan"></head><body><p>Now this is what a well-made, stylish action film should be. It's not quite a classic---it has a RAMBO-like opening action sequence that I personally could have done without---but this 1987 film is undoubtedly one of the better films of the action genre, one tinged with a sci-fi angle that provides slight novelty to what is pretty much a gruesome version of "Ten Little Indians" in a Central American jungle.<br /><br />PREDATOR was directed by John McTiernan, who would expand his popularity as an action director in the following year with the release of the wildly successful DIE HARD. McTiernan could show some of the younger hotshot action directors today how to really craft great action. With both PREDATOR and DIE HARD, he proves that great Hollywood entertainment doesn't have to be simply brainless or crude. In both those films, McTiernan brings energy, wit, and even an eye for beautifully composed images to considerably liven up a potentially routine action thriller. PREDATOR definitely benefits from some terrific jungle scenery and cinematography (by Donald McAlpine); despite its high body count and gruesome gore, the film almost always looks beautiful (which is more than one can say about the action thrillers of younger directors like Michael Bay or Renny Harlin). In a way, McTiernan is a more refined action director than most, emphasizing slick craftsmanship over sheer heart-stopping excitement; but, in the case of this film and DIE HARD, his refinement never dilutes the excitement of the action scenes (which flow beautifully from one scene to another here).<br /><br />The special visual and aural effects of this film still look and sound top-notch today. Stan Winston's conception of the alien creature is still dazzling (and grotesque) to look at, and the sound effects are always convincingly atmospheric. PREDATOR also benefits from a terrific orchestral score by Alan Silvestri, sounding especially muscular on the film soundtrack on this special edition DVD. (Trevor Jones must have been somewhat influenced by it when he scored Renny Harlin's CLIFFHANGER in 1993.)<br /><br />As for Arnold Schwarzenegger (oops, sorry; GOVERNOR Arnold Schwarzenegger), well...once again he proves himself to be a pretty good action hero, with certainly the physique to be one as well as a decent way with a cheesy one-liner (although he only has about three of them in this movie, certainly a lot less than he did in COMMANDO or RAW DEAL). The former Mr. Universe had not, by this film, shown the charisma and likable self-mockery he was to display in later action films and comedies; despite that, PREDATOR remains one of his better films (and a vast improvement over the laughable RAW DEAL).<br /><br />In sum, if you're looking for action fireworks, PREDATOR will fit the bill quite nicely. Director John McTiernan brings a welcome amount of class to the picture, bringing wit and style and even an acute sense of beautiful imagery to what would be merely a crude gorefest in lesser hands. Overall, the picture is a fast-paced (apart from a slow beginning), suspenseful, exciting action ride with a final showdown between good and evil that rivals with the best final showdowns of the action genre.

<meta name="summary" content="One of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET in terms of War Movies with Characters' Depth"></head><body><p>WARNING: Spoilers Ahead!<br /><br />- The special effects of the deaths in the battle field are vividly real.<br /><br />- There are many scenes dealing with human psychology. They made me feel unsettled, and deeply touched. They also showed that the enemies were not always inhumane. For example, in one scene, a Japanese officer ordered his doctor to help a U.S. prisoner. In another scene, some U.S. killed 2 Japanese who surrendered to revenge their buddies' death.<br /><br />- There are many extremely disturbing scenes depicting the fanatic of many Japanese officers and soldiers who prefer suicide to surrendering. In another scene, a soldier lying to his officer about shooting a barking dog and was savagely beaten.<br /><br />- It got an Oscar in 2007 for Best Achievement in Sound Editing,<br /><br />- In short, this is one of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET in terms of war movies with characters' depth</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One serious horror flick!  TREMENDOUS!"></head><body><p>"The Evil Dead" is one serious horror masterpiece. It makes "The Exorcist" look like a "G" rated film. My flesh is still crawling...it will definitely give anyone nightmares, and this digitally remastered version has it all. I bought the Special Edition on DVD. I have never seen more gore, greater sound, so many jump-out-of-your-skin scenes in my life. If you are a horror fan...and have a strong stomach...this one's for you. No kidding everyone...this is a SERIOUS film. It was rated NC-17 when it first came out in 1982. It should stay that way! I was raised on horror films, but I never thought they'd go this far!!! The setting is a deserted cabin in the woods. For 85 minutes you never leave it...nor do you want to! Don't go into the woods! Whatever you do, don't go into the woods! Of all people, I may not sleep well tonight. This film accomplished what I thought no horror flick could ever do...it scared the %$#( out of me. There have been "moments" in other films, but this one is non-stop. I think I'll take a break now and go watch "Peter Cottontail" or something. Wanna get scared? Wanna venture deep into the horror genre'? See "The Evil Dead" and don't let anyone or anything interrupt you. It's better than any thrill ride I've ever been on. It takes your stomach to the same place. I gave it 5 stars on Amazon.com scale.  It deserves a 6.  Don't rent this.  Buy it!  It's one you'll want to relive over and over again when you need/want a good scare...or need/want to scare others.</p></body></html>

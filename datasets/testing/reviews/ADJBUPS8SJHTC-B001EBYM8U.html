Don't get me wrong, he played the role and all, but I didn't like the character. You got this cop who "trains" this rookie cop who don't know nothing about nothing and gets caught up in this we. When he was coerced to take the drugs, he should have walked and asked for a transfer. But when he gets a beat down from the Latinos,all bets was off then. Basically,this guy wanted to be a good cop, and hooked up with a seasoned cop handling his own personal business on company time and got more than he bargained for in the process. This is one gritty film folks.</p></body></html>

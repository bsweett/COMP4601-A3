The film is bookended by moments of seriousness (which keep the film from falling too far outside the Star Trek cannon), but the meat of the story is hilarity all around!<br /><br />The movie begins with the U.S.S. Enterprise crew heading back home (in a Romulan warship) to face the criminal charges stemming from Captain Kirk's decision to destroy the Enterprise.  On the way back to Starfleet, however, the crew finds that the world is in great peril and set off back in time (to twentieth-century San Francisco) to make things right.<br /><br />While in Frisco, the chaos (and hilarity!) begins.  Whether it is Kirk and Spock trying to fit in among the locals, Scotty deciphering old computer technology, or Chekhov trying to find his "nuclear wessels", non-stop laughs abound.<br /><br />When the Enterprise crew finally does return to Starfleet, the scene that follows is one of the most uplifting moments in the entire Star Trek cannon, effectively ending the Star Trek II-IV movie "trilogy" and giving the show new life in the future.<br /><br />To conclude, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is a rousing film filled with non-stop laughs.  Though not as serious as all the other "Original Series" films, this movie has been embraced more than any other for its ability to lampoon both present and future cultures alike.  If you just finished watching Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and are not in the mood for any more gut-wrenching scenes, this is the breathe of fresh air you need!</p></body></html>

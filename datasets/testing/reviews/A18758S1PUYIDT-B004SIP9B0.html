This film is an interesting exploration of the old monarchy vs. the "modern age."  Sure, I think monarchies are old-fashioned and need to go the way of the dinosaur.  But at the same time, I don't see why those who choose not to flaunt their emotions in public should be judged so harshly for it.<br /><br />Otherwise:  James Cromwell does nicely as Prince Phillip, as does the fellow playing Tony Blair.</p></body></html>

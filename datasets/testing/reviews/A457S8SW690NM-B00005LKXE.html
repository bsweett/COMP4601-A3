<meta name="summary" content="A dissapointment, but improvement over the book"></head><body><p>3 and 1/2 stars<br />I watched this film after reading the book. The book was average but not at all as good as the brilliant silence of the lambs. This movie was a big dissapointment to me because after watching the silence of the lambs, I expected another masterpiece. But, I was wrong. Red Dragon was actually much better than this also.<br />But, this movie isn't at all bad, it's a descent movie, better than a lot that I have seen, but after the two others in the series, it was a letdown. Hopkins was of course at his best, and Julliane Moore did well as a replacement for Foster, but Foster was still better. Gary Oldman was also very good as Mason Verger. Hannibal is loose in this film and Clarice Starling and the FBI are trying to hunt him down. Of course, there are many great scenes in this movie, but it fell short of amazing. The ending was very good though, and was much better than Harris's ending.<br />The difference between the silence of the lambs and this is that while the silence of th lambs is creepy because of the cinmatography, Jane Gumb's and Hannibal Lector's characters, and true suspense, this one repulses you by throwing horrifying and disturbing images on the screen. There's a big difference there as you can see.<br />If you liked the silence of the lambs, you'll like this, but you won't love it. But, it is a better movie than the book was. The book was more of a dissapointment, but this movie tried its hardest to turn an average book into a remarquable movie. It ended up being a little short of great, but ended up still being a good movie, that is recommended for fans of the series.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pierce Brosnan steals this show."></head><body><p>Brosnan plays a creepy yet wierdly amusing aging hitman. He runs into a struggling middle class businessman played by Greg Kinear in a Mexico City hotel bar and begins to wreak havoc in his life. All in all they make a pretty entertaining pairing and the film works as a light off-beat comedy.<br /><br />Brosnan really is different from all the polished James Bondish characters he has portrayed. He comes across as slightly deranged, disheviled and just a bit sleazy,yet likeable.<br /><br />Worth checking out.</p></body></html>

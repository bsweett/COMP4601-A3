<meta name="summary" content="Blueprint for action movies"></head><body><p>This is one of my all time favourites! Paul Verhoeven is at his best here! This movie could have easily have turned out into a smooth Hollywood production, but Verhoeven managed to squeeze in a lot of his dark sense of humor somehow. This is adding a real extra dimension to the movie. The movie is situated in a possible future Detroit where the police is privately owned (!) by a company called OCP. OCP now has a plan to call a halt to crime: the Robocop project. All they now need is a "volunteer".<br />Peter Weller was brilliantly cast as Robocop as he basically talks like a robot by nature already. However Kurtwood Smith delivers the best performance here. His role of psychotic gangleader Clarence Boddicker really rocks! Go and watch this<br />as this movie proves, that action movies do not necessarily<br />have to be stupid.(SARR)</p></body></html>

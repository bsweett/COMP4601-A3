<meta name="summary" content="Whole lot of action, whole lot of fun........."></head><body><p>Just watched this for the 2nd time, I surprisingly enjoyed it even more then I did the first time. This movie, although violent and some might think silly at times, is pure revenge fun. This is another one of those if you don't take it to seriously and enjoy it for what it is movies. How can anyone go into this expecting some deep, moving drama with 5-star perfomances? no-no, not this one. It's pure action from beginning to end with a few breaks for some character development, which was another surprise as it was done very well.<br /><br />Anyone remember Deep Blue Sea? The shark movie that 90 percent of the world thought was terrible? (3 stars from me, silly fun) Well Tom Jane played the hero in that one, and he plays the hero in this one as well, and you know what? The man needs a little work. Don't get me wrong, it's not as if he is horrible, but he really needs to work on his emotion and expressions, as in GET SOME!!!! But it's not like he needs to talk in this, just take his shirt off and kill alot, and I do mean alot, of bad guys, which he does fine. I also believe he was Cameron Diaz's love interest in The Sweetest Thing, but I need to see that again before I can comment on his performance.<br /><br />Is it me, or does John Travolta not rule as a bad guy? Everytime he plays the villian he absolutely engulfs the role, adding just the right expressions and mannerisms to really make the character a complete heartless ass. Even in the very poor Battlefield Earth, he was awesome as the main willian, but alas, nothing could have saved that disaster.<br /><br />The supporting actors are all pretty decent, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is the weakest of the bunch, but her roomates are priceless and added alot of touching humor to there roles. Also Kevein Nash is terrific in a small role as "the russian" He is hired to kill Jane's character, Frank Castle, he doesn't say a word, but the fight scene those two have is one of the best I can remember recently.<br /><br />Plot? please, like you all haven't heard this one before, bad dudes kill his family, (twist here, his WHOLE family) and he goes on a major revenge spree. But who cares about the plot, the violence and Travolta are the big attractions here, and both shine quite well.<br /><br />So, don't be too hard on it, I know alot of the comic book fans were not pleased with final product, but the movies rarely do the comic or book justice, but the action and some decent acting with a touch of funny here and there should more then hold you for the 123 minutes this is on, enjoy.<br /><br />acting...........3 stars, Travolta rocks, Jane and Stamos not so much<br /><br />directing.......3.5 stars, Not too bad for a comic book movie<br /><br />special effects....4 stars, Lots of explosions, seriously, lots.<br /><br />action rating.....4 stars, see above. Also strong fight sequences<br /><br />quality.......3.5 stars, Bit dark at times, but still fun.</p></body></html>

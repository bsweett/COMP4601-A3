<meta name="summary" content="this one is only for the kids"></head><body><p>Lacking the originality and the freshness of its two predecessors, Shrek The Third manages a few laughs. Mostly, the jokes are flat and childish. Shrek movies have become known for making fun and delighting their audience with an incredible movie soundtrack, yet, the third installment attempts to be mediocre and gather the attention of little kids (presumably in hopes of staying afloat long enough to earn the big bucks). The Ogre himself has less face movements (with his jaw moving but the rest of the face remaining expressionless) and Fiona is barely in the movie to make much of an impact.<br /><br />The credits, however, are done incredibly well and are enjoyable to watch. If only the rest of the movie was as entertaining.</p></body></html>

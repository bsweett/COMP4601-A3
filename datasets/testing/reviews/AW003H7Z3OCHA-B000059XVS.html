<meta name="summary" content="Wow!  The Greatest &quot;Desert Epic&quot; finally comes to DVD!"></head><body><p>American Film Institute voted &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; the 5th greatest film out of 100 films in the last 100 years (1998).  Winner of 7 Oscars Including; Best Picture 1962 &amp; Best Director - David Lean.  The movie is based on the book &quot;The Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; written by T. E. Lawrence.  This was Lieutanant Lawrence's tale of his adventures in Arabia during World War I while serving as a cartographer in the British Army.<p>T.E. Lawrence (played by Peter O'Toole -his first major role - Oscar nominee) was a British Hero who brought infamy to himself and his counrty through his deeds in Africa.  O'Toole's personifies Lawrence's character to the letter. <p>In Summary; The period was during the war in Africa against the invading Turks.  Lt Lawrence was an eccentric, interlectual &amp;  society outcast who joined the military to serve and explore the Arabian culture.  He manipulated his way into being a miltary advisor for the Arabs in their fight against the Turks.  Up until this time Lawrence was totally incompetent and disliked by all his fellow officers.  Well Lawrences genius and ability to befriend &amp; unite the feuding Arab tribes &amp; fight the Turks was nothing but unbelieveable since his fellow advisors had no success at all.  Lawrence not only unified the tribes, but was adopted &amp; elected by them (his British Officers hated this because of his independent nature) to lead their revolt against the Turks defeating them continuously. He was treated as a world wide hero &amp; devine leader and the rest is history.<p>This movie is the grandest in cinematic scale and the desert mesmerizes our senses.  We become totally absorbed in its splendor.  Digitally remasterd both in picture and sound presents the haunting immense scope of the desert beautifully.<p>The many extras on this DVD make you understand the complexity of the man &amp; the making of this &quot;Desert Epic&quot;.  A very long movie and an very slow evolving telling of this long complicated storyline.  David Lean is the master storyteller &amp; he does this beautifully.</p></body></html>

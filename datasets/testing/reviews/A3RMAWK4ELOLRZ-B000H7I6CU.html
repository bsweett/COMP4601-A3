One day while going to California, McQueen gets left in the middle of the street (accidentally of course).  He goes to Radiator Springs where he accidentally tears up the road.  McQueen is sentenced to fix the road.  While at Radiator Springs, McQueen has a change of heart; he finds out the true meaning of winning is not actually getting the most trophies, it's being a good sport and believing in yourself.<br /><br />..also starring the voice talents of Bonnie Hunt as Sally, and Paul Newman as Doc, cars in Radiator Springs.<br /><br />This is a really good movie!  It has its funny moments.  The cars Guido and Luigi had my dad and I laughing hysterically!!  I don't know about my dad, but this film gave me a warm feeling inside once I left the theatre.</p></body></html>

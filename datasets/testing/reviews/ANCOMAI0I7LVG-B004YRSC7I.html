I mean this with all sincerity, if you miss the first thirty seconds you're screwed.  That said, when caught from the very beginning `Memento' is also one of the most enjoyable and richly rewarding films to be watched.  It's a true stunner of a film, from plot to execution, and is one that will instigate lots of post-watching conversations.  The acting is top-notch, especially from the likes of Guy Pearce (looking like a scraggly Brad Pitt covered in interesting tattoos) who just blew me away here.  I've never really been a fan of Pearce.  In `L.A. Confidential' I felt he was the weakest link and pretty much everything else I see him in I just don't feel him, but here he just soars.  The direction of the film is a thing of beauty really, and Christopher Nolan has pretty much established himself as one of our greatest new-wave directors.  He truly gets into his material and delivers this masterful story in a very unique way which proves to be the grandest embellishment.<br /><br />The film centers around Leonard Shelby, a man who's lost his wife to rape and murder and in the process lost his mind.  He has set out to find the man who did this and punish him.  The movie opens with him killing a man named Teddy.  This is the end of the film, or I should say the end of the story.  Teddy is, for the sake of discussion, the man who raped and murdered Leonard's wife.  The film them jumps back in ten minute segments until we get to the beginning of the film, or should I say the beginning of the story, where we uncover who Leonard came to this conclusion.  What makes this direction so interesting is that the film gives you just enough information to keep you guessing.  It tells you just a little bit and then takes you back and fills you in, leaving new doors open for interpretation before taking you back again and filling you in.  It's truly a masterpiece of a film and executed so well it's a real shame the academy snubbed Nolan his directing nomination.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, Pearce is a spectacle in this film, but there are two other performances within `Memento' that deserve attention.  For one we have Carrie-Anne Moss' who plays a barmaid who is helping Leonard for reasons yet to be uncovered.  Is she really concerned with Leonard's plight or is she using him for her own selfish gain?  Moss surprised me here because I'm really not familiar with her work aside from `The Matrix' and a film like `The Matrix' doesn't really allow the actors to shine, but here she delves into the meat of her character and delivers a great performance.  The real star though, the actor that outshines them all, is Joe Pantoliano of `The Sopranos' fame (yes, that's Ralph).  As Teddy Joe is spot on and delivers an exciting, fresh and completely absorbing performance.  It's funny because my wife and I are HUGE `Sopranos' buffs and when we saw `Ralph' we just about died (since his character was one we loathed from start to his finish) but here he completely sheds his `Sopranos' persona and delivers a separate performance altogether and it paid off wonderfully for him.<br /><br />`Memento' is a film for the ages.  It's one of those movies that may not be your cup of tea, and for that I understand, but really, there isn't much to dislike with this film (that is if you catch it from the start).  There are so many films where one is advised to sit back and turn your mind off but here I'm telling you to sit up and turn your mind on because `Memento' is the type of film that will keep you thinking, keep you guessing, and in the process keep you completely entertained.  The end, or should I say the beginning, plays out in a wonderfully inventive way that is unexpected yet ultimately rewarding.  It packs a huge `wow' factor and I just love that about this film.  I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoilt he surprise, but just be aware that it's not what you'd expect, and that's a beautiful thing!</p></body></html>

The writing will definitely not win any awards and the storyline could have been a  better.  But let's face it, this is an action movie----a popcorn movie that allows you to sit back, not think too much, and just enjoy the ride.  If you think of "The Day After Tomorrow" in those terms, then you are in for a treat.  The story basically is this----there is a huge climatic change in the earth, due to global warming, that triggers a new ice age.  There is a predictable plot of Dennis Quaid's character trying to find his son (played by talented young actor Jake Gyllenhaal), the authority figure (in this pic, the Vice-President) who doesn't heed the warnings of our hero and the belief in mankind to surmount unsurmountable odds.  But the true star of this movie is good old Mother Nature.  From horrific mutiple tornadoes destroying Los Angeles to massive waves flooding the streets of New York City, it is the weather and the awesome power it can display that will hold your attention.  The special effects are incredible (as to be expected from the man who brought us "Independence Day" and "Godzilla").  Should you see this film?  If you want a thrill ride, absolutely!  Strap yourself in and just have fun.  And don't forget the popcorn!</p></body></html>

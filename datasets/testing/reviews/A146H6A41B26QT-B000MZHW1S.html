<meta name="summary" content="The Child Soldiers of Africa"></head><body><p>The second star turn for Leonardo di Caprio in a year, "Blood Diamond" tells a story of Africa--not the wild beauty that comes to mind, but blood and violence, war and arms, greed and manipulation.  Danny Archer is a smuggler. Diamonds are the currrency of war, and Archer moves them from Sierra Leone, where diamond trade is supposedly banned to avoid fueling internal conflicts, to neighboring Liberia for export. Everyone knows few diamonds are found in Liberia, but all choose to ignore that inconvenient fact. In the service of the trade, rebels capture their own people and make them slaves,  panning for stones in shallow streams.<br /><br />But the child soldiers of Africa are the real story of this film. Boys are captured from villages by rebels and in the best totalitarian style brainwashed and ordered to commit unspeakable crimes. Those who resist receive the same punishments the European powers and American slave traders used so effectively for so long.  Everything familiar is stripped away, and the indoctrination is so complete we see a child contemplating killing his own father. The more things change. . . . .<br /><br />This a tough movie, and we almost stopped watching because of the violence at the beginning. But it was worth it--this movie will haunt you for a while.</p></body></html>

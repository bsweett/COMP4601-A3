<meta name="summary" content="Kung Fu Panda"></head><body><p>I would have liked a different actor as the mentor to the panda in this movie, but it was still a fair amount of fun and a good message. I was a bit disappointed in Dreamworks casting. Most families will enjoy it. The one voice that truly didn't seem to quite fit was Dustin Hoffman's. No offense to him but we needed someone who could have called Jack Black's panda, grasshopper. David Carradine would have been good in that role. Some may find Hoffman's high pitched complaints funny, it just didn't strike me that way. It is a fairly entertaining movie for the family. Good quality DVD with decent replayablity. If you enjoyed this catch "Mulan".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

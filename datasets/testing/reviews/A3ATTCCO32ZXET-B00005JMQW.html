<meta name="summary" content="Now I see what all the hype was about."></head><body><p>Dang I'm impressed.  I realize that some people would read that as sarcasm but truthfully, I'm being sincere.  This one is without a doubt the best movie of 2004.<br /><br />On the heels of the first Spiderman movie (a mere two years ago) we find Peter Parker graduated from High School and being put upon by life in general.  Fired from his carpy day job, beset by a grating landlord for the overdue rent on his rinky-dink apartment, missing and failing college classes, lack of love life staring him in the face every time he sees the billboard plastered with his ex-girlfriend's face...we all know guys like this.  Heck, we could all be this guy from time to time.  Even worse, his alter ego as Spiderman is being publicly slandered in the newspaper by his own boss.  Here is one average joe superhero who is taking a massive ego beating.  You're not alone, Charlie Brown.<br /><br />Hold on action fans, Spiderman 2 is no downer!  There's a good balance between the sympathetic backstory and the energy that lured us into the theaters.  Spidey gets plenty of fight play from Doc Octopus, the new supervillain on the block.  There is a great deal of incredible web-swinging as well, better than in the first film; you really get the sense of fun from the spider's-eye view.  I dare say the animators have finally perfected their art here.<br /><br />Now a word of caution to parents.  Like me, you may have assumed that since S1 was fairly low on the violence meter that S2 would be similar.  Regrettably, I think the violence level of S2 was jacked up a bit too high for a movie that appeals so widely to children.  There are just a few too many scenes of actual humans being graphically savaged by Doc Oc for my comfort as the parent of a 6-year-old Spidey fan.  If I had realized that I wouldn't have let him see it until we could buy it on dvd and selectively fast forward through the intense parts.<br /><br />On the whole though, I loved this movie.  I saw a hero that was made more heroic for the fact that he was a very real person with problems who chose to sacrifice his own interests and go fight the good fight anyway.  That's what made this a standout in the genre of comic superhero flicks, the real heroism of the human spirit embodied by Peter Parker.  The cool costume is just a nice bonus (by the way, my eternal thanks to Stan Lee for giving us a superhero without that annoying cape).<br /><br />Go see this on the big screen while you have a chance to enjoy the maximum effect, then buy this for your kids on dvd later.  It's really worth it.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

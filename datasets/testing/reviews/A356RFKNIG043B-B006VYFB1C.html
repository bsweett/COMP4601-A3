<meta name="summary" content="Pitt Hits A Stand-Up Triple"></head><body><p>4.7 stars<br /><br />It's a good sign when you're two hours into a film and wishing it would go on another two. Pitt carries this one so well that it's just a pleasure watching him work, and the script is what lets him be this good.<br /><br />Everything is measured yet compelling, and every bit role is cast and played perfectly. Some movies just feel good from front to back, and Moneyball is in that league. Then again, I love baseball, so maybe I'm biased, but I'd put this one up there with Bang The Drum Slowly and Bull Durham.<br /><br />It was a great real-life story, and so many details are caught just right in this exemplary screenplay. The score has moments of real beauty, and the heavy drama during the 20th win is played to the hilt while the music says it all. It's a treat to see a movie round the bases this convincingly.<br /><br />The box score says that Moneyball is a great baseball movie.</p></body></html>

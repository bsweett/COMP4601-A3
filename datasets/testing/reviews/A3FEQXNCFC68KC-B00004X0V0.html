For no other reason than that, Men in Black is a well-deserved hit. Combine that classic sci-fi charm with a smart combination of different special effects techniques and the chemistry of actors Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith and you have a recipe for fun.<br /><br />Probably the most intriguing element of Men in Black for me is its classic sci-fi charm. The urban legends of the men in black surfaced around the 50's and this movie seems to tip its hat at that prospect. The aliens and gadgets all have that classic 50's sci-fi B-movie aspect in regards to their looks and names. The B-movie aspect is all the funnier when Tommy Lee and the gang interact with this strangeness as if it were an everyday thing. In addition to the classic sci-fi fun you also see some fun with the whole government conspiracy to hide the truth. I'm telling you it's great fun seeing MIB agents with their deadpan looks handle completely outrageous situations.<br /><br />This movie oozes style. Not only with the sci-fi space guns and tech but also the look of the MIB headquarters. It's another throwback to the 50's with some major art deco designs and black and white color schemes. It's like looking into one of those freaky classic movies. Special effects can be a mixed bag, but still fun to watch. You get some really good animatronic effects with a few aliens as well as computer animation, but I tend to give more kudos to the animatronic side of things here. While the CG stuff looks good at a distance it starts to lack on closer shots with that very noticeable shine you get from making a too glossy surface.<br /><br />Another plus on style is the Jones/Smith interaction. It's a lot like a buddy cop film where the two partners are very different from each other. Tommy Lee's straight and serious Agent Friday style of professionalism is perfectly juxtaposed by Will's irreverent wisecracking style. My favorite performance is from Vincent D'Onofrio, who made an enormously entertaining performance as the bug in an Edgar suit. I don't think you could have gotten a better cast.<br /><br />While Men in Black is a definite plus it does have a few limitations. For one the pacing of the movie feels rushed in a certain way, although it's hard to put my finger on. I suppose Will's indoctrination into MIB worked well, but after he became an agent, things moved more mechanically than dynamically. Might be more of a time constraint issue than anything else. Also this movie is slimy. You will find lots of gooey and icky stuff splattering all over the place. Some of you might get into it. I just feel like I need a shower.<br /><br />Men in Black is ultimately light entertainment that pokes fun at the genre while at the same time being true to it. The only people I can't recommend this movie to are the ones who are looking for a whole lot of depth in the story, or can't get around the slimy stuff.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Suspense: Applause and Curtain Call for Tom Clancy and Cast"></head><body><p>THE SUM OF ALL FEARS may be 10 years old not but it packs a wallop no matter how many times it is viewed. Credit the particular genius of Tom Clancy and his memorable creation of the main character in these suspense/espionage thrillers for that, but at the same time much credit is due screenwriters Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne for the tense dialogue and DiRector Phil Alden Robinson for the pacing of this story. As far as the story is concerned, very briefly the essence can be summarized as follows: When the president of Russia suddenly dies, a man whose politics are virtually unknown succeeds him. The change in political leaders sparks paranoia among American CIA officials, so CIA director Bill Cabot recruits a young analyst to supply insight and advice on the situation. Then the unthinkable happens: a nuclear bomb explodes in a U.S. city, and America is quick to blame the Russians.<br /><br />Jack Ryan was a role that seemed to belong to Harrison Ford in the other Clancy films, but here that role is assumed very well indeed by Ben Affleck. He is capably assisted by Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Bruce McGill, Liev Schreiber and Philip Baker Hall along with a large cast of supporting actors. They give it their all and make this film work on every level. For solid entertainment this is a film that deserves repeated visits. Grady Harp, December 11</p></body></html>

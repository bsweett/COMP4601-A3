I enjoy period movies and books especially those around the turn of the (last) century, so I was drawn to this movie.  I was interested to read the reviews to find out how others related to the film.  The plot was fascinating and the acting was excellent.  The storyline was well done as well.  Not really one feel good moment in the film, so if you are interested in that, look elswhere.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to those with a bent towards period pieces and the accompanying accents and outifts.  For me, this was a very enjoyable 4 star film.</p></body></html>

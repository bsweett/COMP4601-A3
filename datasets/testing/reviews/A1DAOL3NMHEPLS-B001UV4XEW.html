<meta name="summary" content="Unoriginal, but off-and-on funny"></head><body><p>Just watched this on DVD, and while I laughed several times, I felt that I've seen most of this material before. Take equal parts "Go" and "Dude, Where's My Car," throw in a dash of "Sideways," and you've got "The Hangover."  It's certainly funny in spots, but there's too much violence for a comedy in my opinion; watching people get badly beaten, tasered, etc. is not my idea of humor.</p></body></html>

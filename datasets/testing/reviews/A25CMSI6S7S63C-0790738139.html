<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Modern Film Noirs"></head><body><p>I just finished watching this for the first time in a long time. This is an EXCELLENT film noir. Its not often a modern day noir hits the jackpot but this did. This movie takes place around the time where classic Film Noirs were being made. The pace is swift, the acting is fantastic, all the stars were perfect in their roles. Excellent story. It reminded me of the great Cagney, Bogart and Robinson gangster/noir movies. It might take a few times to understand it all, but you will be truly rewarded with a fantastic movie, a must of fans of Film Noir.the cast - Kevin Spacey,Russell crowe,James Ellroy,Kim Basinger are just FANTASTIC. Highly recommended. Not too terribly gory for those with a squeamish stomach. Great DVD with bonus features galore...</p></body></html>

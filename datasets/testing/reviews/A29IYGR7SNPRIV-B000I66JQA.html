<meta name="summary" content="Stunning!"></head><body><p>A book is not a movie. A movie is not a book. While both are visual media, in the sense that we absorb the content through our eyes, a film must succeed primarily via what is unstated but suggested, while a book must make a statement. I loved the book. I was reluctant to see the film. I needn't have been concerned. The film is faithful to the essence of the book, and that's what is important.<p>With heartfelt performances throughout, exquisitely fine-tuned editing, and great directorial skill, everything pulls together to make a series of intertwined statements about the inner lives of women versus what is displayed externally.<p>Without question, this is the best performance Meryl Streep has given in a very long time. Her Clarissa is strong yet vulnerable; she is the classic caregiver whose feelings get glossed over or put on hold while what must be done gets done. Julianne Moore is, as always, flawless in her ability to make us feel what her character feels. And the big surprise is Kidman's performance; she moves in and takes up residence inside Virginia Wolfe--haunted and driven, conflicted and yet optimistic, even in her contemplations of death. <p>Splendid as ever in supporting roles, Claire Danes, Allison Janney and Toni Collette each offer fully dimensional characters in their brief times onscreen. I was particularly taken by young Jack Rovello as Richie and Ed Harris as the poet Richard. There is something very potent both in the casting and in the roles as they're played out.<p>Altogether this is a remarkable film--one that is about women but that doesn't show them to be weak or helpless or dependent upon men either for rescue or survival. It's about struggling to get past the restrictions of society and its imposed definition of who and what women ought to be. This isn't lightweight material; it's thoughtful and provocative--just as the book was. And so the film succeeds brilliantly in carrying the message successfully from one medium to another. Not cheery viewing, but definitely enlightening.<br />Most highly recommended.</p></body></html>

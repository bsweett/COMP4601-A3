I had a glass of whiskey and a swell dame close by.  She hadn't shot my partner.  That would be bad for detectives everywhere, so I didn't let her take the fall this time.<br /><br />Taken from the amazing Dash Hammet mystery novel, The Maltese Falcon translated to film without a hitch.  In fact, Dash co-wrote the script and much of the novel's dialogue is uttered by the likes of Bogey, Mary Astor, Sid Greenstreet and Peter Lorrie.  In Hammet's world, everyone is lying.  This is the first Noir film, dark and cynical. There's something in my drink.  John Houston shoots it without thrills.  There aren't any fancy Orwellian shots, so for that reason, some film schools are snobby about this film.  All the scenes take place in a Hollywood set including exteriors.<br /><br />Ah, but the characters drive this 41 Chevy coupe.  Sam Spade is the American.  Bogart refines this icon character a few years later in Casablanca.  Spade has seen it all and he doesn't stick his neck out for nobody unless his code is lanced.  Then all the fury of detectivehood is unleashed and even a great kisser can take the fall.</p></body></html>

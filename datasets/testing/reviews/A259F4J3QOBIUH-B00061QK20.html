This is a masterful film, and a movie to treasure.  I also recommend purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Q6VXC">House of Flying Daggers</a>.  For those who somehow missed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXR4">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>, I suggest adding that to your wish list, as well.<br /><br />I was only slightly interested in martial arts films, until <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXR4">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a> was created, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Q6VXC">House of Flying Daggers</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00030590I">Hero</a> have expanded my interests.  These movies are truly masterful productions, and they have inspired many other beautiful films.  This genre is unique and highly recommended.<br /><br />If the name Quentin Tarantino freaks you out, or makes you think only of Gore, Violence, and potty mouths....relax.  This is different: not his usual fare.  Personally, I love Quentin Tarantino movies, but I can understand why some people might avoid HERO, due to his other work.  No worries; this is not what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.  He is a genius, and this movie fits well with the genre of oriental / martial arts / beautiful cinematography films listed above.<br /><br />Don't judge the movie by the name on the cover, but by the reviews and images on the cover.  You will be impressed, amazed, and gain a new respect for Quentin Tarantino.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still Bright in a Dark Genre"></head><body><p>I read Stephen Kings the Shining when I was 9 years old and the book frightened me, I could see in my minds eye the Overlook Hotel, its starkness in the winter, the isolation that the family had to endure, I always loved how King could take buildings and breathe into them a misty haunted frightening humanity of some kind. The first movie I ever saw Jack Nicholson in was One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest, and then I saw him in this, so I automatically see him as crazy, his wild eyes and forehead and that hair help with that vision greatly! Although the book explained what Shining was in more detail, Kubrick shortened it enough to get the point across, to me his films although they are visceral and sometimes leave a bad taste in your mouth, are so cleanly lit and the sets are maddeningly perfect.<br /><br /> I was certainly scared, of "that" room, the lady in the tub, the twin girls, all the blood, but what I was most scared of was how badly that hotel wanted that family to suffer and die, and how desperate Wendy was to save her child and realize that by doing that she had to kill her husband. Kubrick really got across the struggle between disbelief and the resolve to survive. The only thing I couldn't stand, and its no fault of Kubricks, or Kings, but the whole "redrum" chant to this day is a bit comical for me, because everyone copies it, holding up their finger, making their voice strange and gravely, I even do it at inappropriate times, like when I see some kid in the mall with a bowl cut. I would recommend anyone who hasn't see this classic movie, to buy it. Don't watch it on TV, because its just so edited its "Overlook Light".</p></body></html>

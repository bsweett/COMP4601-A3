I mean I guess I can see how maybe she just isn't your brand of actress, but truly, she is extraordinary.  She has turned out classic performance after classic performance and is a standup person to boot.  Her portrayal of Erin Brockovich may actually be one of her most challenging roles and she delivers it with such precise determination and dedication that she becomes so real and engaging and truly memorable.  The best thing about `Erin Brockovich' though is that Roberts is not the only reason to stay and watch.  Sure, she has everything a movie star needs to keep her audience at her beck-and-call, but Soderbergh (who had such a marvelous year in 2000) doesn't rely solely on Roberts to carry his film.<br /><br />`Erin Brockovich' sports a brilliant script penned by Susannah Grant that utilizes fact with Hollywood drama and peppers in enough humor and charm to make the film stand out apart from your everyday biopic.<br /><br />The film tells to story of Erin Brockovich, a brash young single mother who winds up working for attorney Ed Masry.  Erin doesn't always rub people the right way, but her blunt self-confidence carries her a long way in the legal world, especially when she takes it upon herself to investigate further a case involving a power company and their blatant disregard for the health of the citizens of Hinkley, California.  As Erin becomes absorbed in the case her personal life starts to take a turn as she meets her kind-hearted yet gruff-exteriored neighbor George.  `Erin Brockovich' does a masterful job of melding this woman's personal and professional life together in a way that makes both sides of her interesting and entertaining, never once waning.<br /><br />One of the main reasons to watch this film is to witness the rapport between the actors on the screen.  Julia Roberts is a standout, obviously, but everyone involved pulls their weight and works wonderfully together.  Albert Finney is flawless as Ed Masry and should have won that Oscar.  His chemistry with Roberts is beautiful to witness, just beautiful.  In infuses this sense of paternal concern into his performance that makes Masry a likable and relatable character.  Another standout is Aaron Eckhart who marvelously captures the heart of George.  He plays to Roberts strengths and helps keep the personal side of this story lively and tender.<br /><br />In the end, `Erin Brockovich' is a film that stands on its own, a film that deserves to be seen and lauded.  Roberts received countless amounts of praise for her performance (and a much deserved Oscar to boot) but I think the Academy Award nominations for Supporting Actor, Screenplay, Director and Best Picture speak for themselves in declaring just how impressive this film really is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Seemed like a formula flick even though it was a true story"></head><body><p>I wanted to see this film because there was a lot of buzz about it and because I like gangster films.  However, I never read much about it first, and therefore didn't realize that it was based on a true story which happened in the 1970s.  I saw it simply as another Hollywood formula flick with Denzel Washington cast as the drug kingpin and Russell Crowe cast as the honest cop who brings him down.  That said, I relaxed and enjoyed the film, but I must say that I laughed out loud often because of what seemed like a very contrived plot.  For example, the cop character turns in a million dollars in unmarked bills making him hated by other cops and therefore incorruptible.  And the African American drug kingpin from the South buys a house for his mama.  Denzel Washington plays it cool, so cool in fact that he seems unreal, especially in the scenes where he goes to Southeast Asia to buy drugs from the source.  He is always dapper and in control of all emotions.  His role called for little if any subtleties.  Russell Crowe, on the other hand, had a more difficult role to play.  His character was always full of self doubt.  In spite of that, or perhaps because of that, it became a mission for him to arrest Denzel Washington.  How it all plays out makes a fast, well paced film, which held my interest throughout.<br /><br />It was only at the end of the film that I realized that the story was real, and then I went flying to the internet to learn more background.  This gives the film a different context and I appreciated it more.  But I just can't help remember how funny some of the stereotypes were.<br /><br />Recommended for some light entertainment, but American Gangster doesn't even get on the playing field when compared with a show like the Sopranos.</p></body></html>

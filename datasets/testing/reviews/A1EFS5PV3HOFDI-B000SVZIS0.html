<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable in its own Tim Burton way"></head><body><p>In his own time-honored way, Tim Burton has made yet another enjoyable movie, however rotten the ending may have been.<br />Frankly, Mark Walberg should have just stayed on the now free planetarium of apes, instead of ending up where he did.<br /><br />He didn't even get the girl, well....in the conventional way at least. Actually, he seemed to be pretty populare with both species on that footing. Hmmmmmm. Must have been that manly physique of his.<br /><br />I've watched the first planet of the apes when I was younger, and I must say at least this updated version is alot cooler and interesting to watch for two hours. And its rather funny to see Charlton Heston's roles switched from the human hero to the dying father of General Thade, although his dialouge still ran in the same rut of the first one, giving us a pretty clear idea how his relations with human's lay.<br /><br />There's even a few scenes with Paul Giamatti (Sideways,Big Mamma's house,)as the slave trader. And if you've ever seen big fat liar, one can clearly see he went for the blue body garb with orange hair once again.<br /><br />A good action flick with plenty of CGI environments to spice up the apes world. The few shots of outer space in the beginning wasn't bad either, I especially enjoyed the magnetic field that Mark flew into. But enough of that, I won't bore you with any more details.</p></body></html>

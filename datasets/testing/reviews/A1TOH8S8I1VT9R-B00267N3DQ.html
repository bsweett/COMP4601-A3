<meta name="summary" content="5 star Film, 15 Star DVD...  ...time is running out!!!"></head><body><p>I just bought this film.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to find (check out my review date).  For anyone collecting Disney animated features; GRAB IT NOW!!<br />  What can I say about the film that hasn't been said.  Despite its' age (The first successful animated feature)it has some of my favorite Disney animated moments.  This film carries with it a sense of real innocence and purity of story that has not been acheived since.  Here is a list of what I liked about this DVD and Film;<br /><br />THE FILM<br /><br />-Again, purity and innocence of story.<br />-Dance sequence in dwarfs cottage, one of the most joyful in film history.<br />-Dwarfs mourning over the Princess, one of the most heart-wrenching in film history.<br />-As benign as the Princess is, she has moments of incredible charm and like-ability; "YOU must be GRUMPY" hits the nail on the head!!<br />-Wicked Queen starts the Disney tradition of villains with a bang.  She's so mean and crazy she taunts skeletons in her dungeon; "..WANT A DRINK!?".<br /><br />-Artwork is dated... ...and icredibly charming. The colors used are breathtaking.<br />-Songs are timeless.<br /><br />THE DVD<br />-Quality of picture and sound as good as can be expected for the time of original production.  You really must nit-pick to find a flaw.<br />-Extras are overwhelming!!<br />-Dopey's mine ride is a cute little game.<br />-Deleted scenes a real treat.  One of them actually fully colored with backgrounds.  "Musical Soup" is hillarious!<br />-"The Goddess of Spring" short film is very interesting.  It's use as a "test" for the Snow White concept is obvious.  Some good chuckles for it's crude execution.<br />-The worst thing with this DVD is how difficult it is removing the disks from their hubs.<br />-I wish Wide Screen existed when Disney made this film, just imagine....<br /><br />Why the first Successful animated feature?  There were other(s?) made before Snow White, including Max Fliechers "Gullivers Travels" which rushed production to get to theaters ahead of Disney.  However, no previous attempt captivated audiences minds, hearts and money like "Snow White".  "Snow White" validated the financial side of making an animated feature.<br /><br />Regrettably, I've owned this DVD for 24 hours so I have not had the time to view all of it.  However, it's safe to say that I love it so far!  I'm not an "easy" critic for what that's worth. I know this is a pricey DVD even by Disney standards.  But consider that my collection of 200 DVDs has an average price of $11 and I do not regret this purchase for one minute!!!  A MUST HAVE!!!<br /><br />Addition 1-29-2008<br /><br />This is tentatively schedule for re-release in October of 2009.</p></body></html>

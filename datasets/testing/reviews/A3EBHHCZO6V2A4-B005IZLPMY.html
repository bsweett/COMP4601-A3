Chris Evans makes Captain America a down-to-earth, refreshingly humble superhero. He starts as a scary skinny recruit, but becomes a super soldier. To his chagrin, he is used for patriotic propaganda. He fights back, and fights, FOR REAL. Tommy Lee Jones stars as his mentor. Dominic Cooper of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJFO">The History Boys</a> again stars in a period piece, though this time it's as Captain America's sidekick rather than a British schoolboy. Hugo Weaving, who was the gentle&brave elf lord Elrond (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition)</a>), relishes being the villainous head of HYDRA, Red Skull. When he removes his face a la <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630512762X">Face/Off</a> it's a truly creepy moment, showing how Red Skull has lost his humanity in his quest for power. Samuel L. Jackson also makes an appearance in the twist ending, making it like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXQA">Unbreakable (Two-Disc Vista Series)</a>. "Captain America: First Avenger" goes for an over-the-top retro look, an exaggerated WWII era.<br /><br />This would be an otherwise routine action film with explosions&gunfights, if it weren't for the humility and hunkiness of Chris Evans. He's likeable as Captain America. "Captain America" is all for the American way! Long live the USA!</p></body></html>

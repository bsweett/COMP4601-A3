<meta name="summary" content="THE INCREDIBLE HULK-EVERYONE LIKED IT!"></head><body><p>This was a three to four star film as far as all members of my recent movie party (on my 52" HDTV) were concerned.  I thought the wives in the group would only tolerate the film, but everyone was in agreement that this movie was lots of fun and very enjoyable.<br /><br />Even my wife thought the computer graphics were really good and did justice to the Hulk. In fact, she felt sorry for Ed Norton's character (which means the film worked for her). We both are looking forward to getting the Iron Man into the fray!</p></body></html>

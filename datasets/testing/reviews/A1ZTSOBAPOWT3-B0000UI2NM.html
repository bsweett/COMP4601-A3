<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Blunderworld&quot;"></head><body><p>Wow, a Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves... &quot;Underworld&quot; looked like it was going to be great, but it was a huge disappointment. The story has been overkilled so many times. The action lacks style. The special effects weren't very special. A kindergartner can draw better werewolves with his or her foot. I'm sorry, but do not watch this waste.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of Kubrick's best"></head><body><p>First off is Stanley Kubrick's addition to the slew of Vietnam war films that came out during the '86-'87 film season. Based on an effective novella about the Vietnam War titled Short-Timers, Kubrick's take on that war and the military (specifically the U.S. Marine Corps.) at that time is one that's very anti-war and also shows the dehumanizing effect that young men go through to become effective soldiers.<br /><br />I agree with Ed that the first half of the film during Corps bootcamp is very effective and also very brutal. The dehumanizing tactics used to turn soldiers like Pvts. Joker, Cowboy and Pyle into killing machines has Kubrick's style written all over it. Kubrick succeeded in showing the brutality of their training, yet still keeps the audience at a distance. Its almost clinical in the way he pulled it off. The stand out performances by R. Lee Ermey as Gunny and a young Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt. Pyle made the first half of Full Metal Jacket a classic in my book. The second half on the other hand loses some of the effectiveness of the bootcamp scenes.<br /><br />Kubrick tried to show the inhumanity of war through scenes for the Battle for Hue. The scenes are well-shot, but Kubrick's knowledge of city-fighting was very limited and he has talked about it in some detail that he didn't want to really show the battle accurately. He needed a major set piece and the Battle for Hue was a major battle the USMC fought in and used it. This second half is also where he deviated from the book. The book showed the camraderie that Joker and Cowboy had during bootcamp and then throughout Hue and showed that even through war's inhumanity and insanity soldiers kept a bond with their comrades that allowed for heroism to shine through. Kubrick's take on the second half was that war made instant cynics and murderers of people no matter how principled they may be.<br /><br />I may disagree with the second half's treatment of the book and of Kubrick's unsubtle antiwar message, but this film has to count as one of his best. Right up there with The Shining. Spartacus and Lolita.</p></body></html>

They usually don't conform to the standard Hollywood storytelling model, which means there are gaps and inconsistencies and odd duck characters and miscues that aren't entirely justified or the structure of the films is slanted without a clear "beginning" "middle" and "end" or where a "twist" takes the place of a genuinely motivated character arc -- in general in his case this is not a good thing but every once in a while it gives a fresh and unique edge to his films.  "Lady in the Water" was no exception -- and it was clear from the beginning that Shyamalan didn't want to make concessions: he set up a cast of "misfits" and contrived a story that would bring them together under a common cause, and wasn't worried about mixing genres or stretching the limits of plausibility or giving his characters enough evidence for us to believe that they would believe in and embrace this cause at the peril of their lives.  This is a story about abandoning oneself to believe in the power of stories, about suspending disbelief and letting the storyteller tell her story however ludicrous its implications become.  (What is odd is that he seems to want to say that if we can just abandon ourselves to stories we will be better people and there will be less war, etc. -- but of course it is often the willingness to accept stories about "good" and "evil" without fact that gets us so riled up about going to war in the first place).  In any case there is something obviously self-serving and a bit naive about the premise of the story -- and the self-reference is as blatant as it can get in this film, since Shyamalan himself acted the part of the writer who was going to write a lot of strange things that would not be accepted at first but eventually would change the world through the power of belief (not to mention the one person who gets "eaten" in this film is a film critic who can't write anything himself but likes to criticize films for lacking neat plots and stories, i.e. one who wouldn't have liked "The Village" or this film).  Still, as stories tinged with the fantastic go I enjoyed this one (it's a better film than "Signs," which did much better at the box office).  It worked even better for me on the small screen when I watched it again with a couple of my children on dvd.  There I wasn't so bothered by the obviously grandiose delusions of the film (and its filmmaker) -- but just enjoyed, most of all, the undeniably fascinating and powerful performance at the heart of this film by Paul Giamatti, one of the most consistently strong supporting actors in Hollywood, here given center stage.  Three stars for the film, and five stars for Giamatti give this film my four star rating.<br /><br />The way I think of M. Night Shyamalan's films is that he is like a small budget independent filmmaker who happens to have big budgets.  This is sometimes good and sometimes bad.  He tells small stories that appeal to a niche audience -- but luckily for him that niche has coincided with a fairly large number of Americans: mostly sci-fi/fantasy lovers and "believers" who like their fantasy movies to hint at transcendence (the afterlife, etc.)  Where this is a drawback is that weaknesses in plot or limitations in scope or unconventional stories that you could forgive (or even celebrate as an alternative) in a small budget independent film are hard to accept in a glossy big budget feature put out by Disney or another major studio.  Watching "Signs," for example, it struck me that I would have liked it much better if it hadn't had such big name actors and hadn't obviously had such a large budget.  It feels like a "small film" about a crisis of faith and an identity crisis, but its science fiction premise overwhelmed this rather than working seamlessly with it.  (Unlike, say, Spielberg's "Close Encounters" -- a film that was able to manage both intimacy with the characters and a global science fiction premise).  Shyamalan obviously has visual talent and the ability to coax exceptional performances from his actors and has been lucky enough to hit upon a few stories that resonated enough at the box office that he has been given free range for quite a few films.  Plus, the studios he has worked for have had the good sense to market his films as being different and as expressing his unique vision. I don't know how much longer that is going to work for him, though -- with films like this one and his previous one that have had diminishing returns in the box office he may have to turn to creating the kinds of independent and low budget but high concept films that he would have been making if he hadn't had the good luck to have the right actors and the right kind  of buzz that made "Sixth Sense" a smashing success.</p></body></html>

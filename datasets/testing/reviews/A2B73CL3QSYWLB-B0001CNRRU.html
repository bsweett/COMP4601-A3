<meta name="summary" content="A Dynamite Film"></head><body><p>To descibe a film as being truly original is thrown around so often but in the case of "21 Grams" it totally applies.  Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a new talent to be reckoned with.  The structure and editing of this film is so unique that it takes your breath away.  It's like fragments of a whole that seem to be random but come together at the end for a satisfying conclusion.  Inarritu takes three disparate individuals whose lives couldn't be so different who, through circumstance and tragedy,intersect.  The acting in this film by the three principles is top-notch.  I thought Sean Penn as the heart transplant recipient gave a better performance here than he did in "Mystic River" in which he won the Oscar.  Naomi Watts continues the stellar work that started with "Mullholland Drive" as the grieving widow.  I save my highest praise for Benicio Del Toro who continues to amaze with his portrayal of the ex-con who finds Jesus.  I recommend this film highly, in particularly for the more ambitious film-lovers.</p></body></html>

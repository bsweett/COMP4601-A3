<meta name="summary" content="Liked the movie version"></head><body><p>Based on a book about Marie, this movie focuses on the arranged marriage of a young Marie to a man she hasn't met. What follows is high pressure protocol and frustration over a husband who is reluctant to bed her and produce a child. Marie begins to live the life of a 'Paris Hilton' and angers the subjects of France during a difficult financial period for the country. Whether Marie actually said 'let them eat cake' is still being debated, but I liked the way the movie was written and the performance by Kirsten Dunst.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

This is the dark side of Marvel comics characters, a sort of nasty Doberman they keep out of sight when friends are visiting, but want to have around for less welcome characters. Thomas Jane (probably best remembered as the brooding shark wrangler in Deep Blue Sea) does a pretty good job portraying what is probably one of the most difficult and grounded Marvel hero's (I use the term loosely). He is first and foremost a victim, turned vigilante, bringing restitution to those who have escaped the law. The twisted morality card is played LARGE here, as Travolta heads up a pretty vicious organized crime mob, who murder the entire family of our hero, during a family reunion. A few more sadistic scenes reinforce in the viewer the need for these baddies to die summarily, and horribly where possible, as they have worn out any votes of sympathy with the audience. Overall, it's a very dark, at times extremely violent, but enjoyable drama. Yes, I said drama, and that point is probably the paradoxical weakness of the movie. He's a man, he bleeds, he can die, he has no cape, and he certainly can't fly. However, he can survive severe beatings, bullet wounds, stabbing, fire and explosions, and still bounce back with a grimace, and his own small arms factory (remember what I said about suspension of disbelief). If I had to make a criticism, it would be that paradox - the very shaky walking between two genres, that almost, but not quite comes off. On the one hand, this is an adult themed violent revenge movie with attitude, on the other it's a Marvel character romp complete with unlikely characters, and some very misplaced dialogue. Jane looks the part at least, and spends most of the movie sulking inside a whisky bottle, when he's not killing villians which actually makes you feel for his character more than you would expect. Not too many surprises, but good CGI, good support cast, great stuntwork, and tight script make this 3.5, but not quite 4 stars. DVD has 4 featurettes that are well worth a look, as well as usual deleted scenes, commentary and trailers etc. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

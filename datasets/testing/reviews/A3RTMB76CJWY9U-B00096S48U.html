<meta name="summary" content="(Too) Faithful to the Original (?)"></head><body><p>The Omen is about a United States Ambassador who slowly comes to realize that his "son," Damien, is actually the Anti-Christ. It is a remake of a 1976 classic by the same name.<br /><br />It is a very faithful remake.<br /><br />Maybe... too faithful. Allow me to explain.<br /><br />Films are more than plotlines, characters and dialogue. Like literature, they also have mood, tone and style. Again, like literature, there are certain time periods that have certain defining characteristics--Victorian literature feels distinct from literature produced during the Harlem Renaissance. With cinema, 70s movies feel different than 60s movies or 80s movies. They come from different cultures, different times, with different fears, hopes and beliefs.<br /><br />Taking a film from the 70s, like the Omen, and remaking it as faithfully as they have here, feels odd, watching it in a theater in 2006. It doesn't feel like a modern movie. It feels like a 70s movie because, in a lot of ways, it is. This is not to say that it is a bad film--many 70s movies were quite good, and the Omen is a pretty good film in any era. However, it rings slightly off to the modern ear; it arose from a culture and a society that has subsequently moved on. Stephen King, in his excellent Danse Macabre, argued that the evil in horror usually is a manifestation of what the culture currently finds frightening. In the 50s, we were worried about nuclear annihilation, and so most of our horror film threats were either from the skies or the results of science/radiation. A giant bug movie, made today, feels strange (unless it is a throwback parody, like Eight Legged Freaks). This movie, in recapturing a 70s film, is fighting against things that no longer frighten us in quite the same ways.<br /><br />The teenagers in the theater I saw the Omen in didn't need the academic explanation--they knew it was dated, too, and sniggered more often than screamed.<br /><br />Technically, this is a very good film. The acting is all fine, and the filming, direction, lighting, effects, etc., all serve their purposes. The stunt casting of Mia Farrow (who played Rosemary--mother of the Anti-Christ--in Rosemary's Baby, another 70s film) was genius, and she does not disappoint. She plays creepy to the hilt.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good movie and an incredibly faithful remake of a famous 70s film. The biggest drawback, perhaps, is that, by being so very faithful to the original, we've resulted with a movie that is slightly out of step with our current culture and rings slightly false to the modern ear. If you've never seen the original 70s movie, no need--for all intents and purposes, they've recreated it for you, here.</p></body></html>

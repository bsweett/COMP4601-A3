<meta name="summary" content="Some good action and characters, though very talky"></head><body><p>Not that I mind talking per se--and Q.T. did a great job with the talking scenes in Pulp Fiction--but here, the scenes of people chatting, socializing, etc. go on much too long and don't add much to the story.  This could have benefited from some trimming here and there; it ends up being 2.5 hours long as it is.<br /><br />Otherwise, Brad Pitt turns in another excellent performance as Aldo, the leader of a small group of Nazi hunters who scalp the Nazis after killing them, though they also release a few of them after carving swastikas on their foreheads as a warning.  Eli Roth is great as his righthand man, and the fellow playing Landa, their primary foe, is outstanding.  The photography in France is very nice, as are the locations; the songs chosen well; and the scenes of violence are actually rather brief and not as graphic as in some of QT's previous work.</p></body></html>

Personally, I think this movie is perfectly blended with action and humor at the same time. Pitt and Jolie both portray spies that have been married for 5 or 6 years, but neither one of them know it. The fun begins when they find out the truth about one another. I thought it was hilarious to see these 2 married people trying to kill each other. I think a lot of people missed the real element of this movie. It was not action drama. It was more romantic comedy with a splash of action pitting husband against wife, or a battle of the sexes if you will. Jolie kicks butt as always, and Pitt does a great job too as always. This movie was fantastic in my opinion.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not worth the 1%"></head><body><p>This movie is 99% stupidity and 1% hilarity. Take out that 1% and this would be one of the worst things ever put on film. As it is, it still belongs in the lowest tier of cinematic garbage. The humor is shallow and gets old VERY quickly. Mostly, it's just rude and awkward. Save your money.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></body></html>

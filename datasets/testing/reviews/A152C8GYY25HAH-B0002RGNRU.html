Some are big budget ventures whose sole purpose is to entertain. These are relatively easy. Despite a critic's personal feelings, it fairly easy to see that, for example, "Spiderman 2" is a lot more bang for the buck than "Lara Croft 2".<br /><br />Movies like "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" are harder to write about because they aspire to be art. Whether or not they entertain in the conventional sense is of secondary importance. `Art' is such a subjective thing. When a reviewer uses words like `masterpiece', `genius' or `brilliant', a red flag is raised. The opinion becomes very subjective. To me, "Eternal Sunshine" is the most interesting American movie I have seen so far in 2004. It is also the best love story / romantic comedy I have watched in awhile. To you, the opposite may be true.<br /><br />The premise itself is simple. Joel [Jim Carrey] and Clementine [Kate Winslett], two eccentric people, meet and fall in love. They have a falling out, and Clementine resorts to a doctor [Tom Wilkinson] who knows how to erase all memory of Joel from her mind. Naturally, this leaves Joel dazed and confused. When he finds out the truth, the angry young man confronts the doctor and his staff. Forlorn and desperate, he takes the only logical course and has the doctor erase HIS memories of Clementine. The question then becomes whether or not true love can ever really be forgotten.<br /><br />The movie bounces wildly between past and present, between real memories and false ones. This is the way it loses some viewers because the plot is anything but linear.<br /><br />Since "The Truman Show", I've thought that Carrey is a remarkable actor who has been trapped by his "I'm so funny" reputation. He really should get a Best Actor Oscar nod for his work here. Kate Winslett is superb as Clementine. In supporting roles, Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Woods and Mark Ruffalo are outstanding.<br /><br />I think in years to come "Eternal Sunshine" will be rememberd as both a mesmerizing love story and as a sharp commentary on relationships is the early 21st Century.</p></body></html>

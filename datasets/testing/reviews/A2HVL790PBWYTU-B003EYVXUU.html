Second, this American remake of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is actually really good. I do have a preference for the Swedish adaptation, partly because it was the original film, partly because I still regard it as the superior film. Thankfully, director Matt Reeves did make sure to get novelist John Ajvide Lindqvist's blessings. Moments into the American version, that sinking feeling I had going in dissipated, never to return.<br /><br />The plot, if you haven't heard yet, tracks the bond formed between a lonely, mercilessly bulled boy and a vampire girl who moves in next door. It's sweet, yes, but horrifying. LET ME IN is one of the best horror films I've seen in recent years. It is stunningly atmospheric and stark and melancholy, graced with soulful acting by the two lead children, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz. These two kids are heartbreaking. One of the most striking elements is the film's deglamourizing of vampirism. "Abby," eternally twelve years old, leads a a bleak, nomadic existence. Her predations reduce her to this feral, primal ghoul, and it's ugly to see, and shocking. It's indicative of Smit-McPhee and Moretz's extraordinary performances that you still find yourself rooting for their relationship to work out, for things to turn out okay for them. Never mind that Abby requires human blood to sustain her.<br /><br />It's obvious that Matt Reeves is drawing metaphors between vampirism and adolescence as a torturous existence. It's true, though, that real horror originates from close to home, when it's grounded in reality. Even more terrifying than the vampire element are those three kids who relentlessly victimize Owen in school. The score realizes this and introduces this really ominous beat whenever the trio converges on Owen. Sue me, I couldn't wait for them to get their violent comeuppance. And that's the twisted bit about this film, really. It makes you care about Owen and Abby and even about Abby's "father," who is a serial killer (played by Richard Jenkins, excellent).<br /><br />Horror cinema and artistic merit are barely nodding acquaintances, but both converge in this movie. LET ME IN stands out from the pack, draws your eye like a bare-footed child on a chilly night. Or blood spilled on the snow banks of wintry Los Alamos, New Mexico. It fills you with creeping dread and leaves you with a bittersweet aftertaste. The love story is unconventional but hauntingly moving. Abby confesses to Owen, "I've been twelve for a very long time." As the cycle begins anew.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus material: Audio Commentary by Director Matt Reeves; "From the Inside: A Look at the Making Of LET ME IN (00:17:05 minutes long); "The Art of Special Effects" - goes into the components that make up the film's various CG-rendered sequences: the tunnel kill; Abby scaling the exterior hospital wall, Abby hurdling a fence, etc. (00:06:30); "Car Crash Sequence Step-by-Step" - if you've seen the film, you know the one (00:05:36); 3 Deleted Scenes with optional Director's audio commentary, including one fairly disturbing scene which reveals how Abby was herself turned into a vampire (00:05:09); a trailer gallery; and a poster & still gallery. And there's also a mini comic book insert from Dark Horse Comics, the first issue in a four-part mini-series which is the "official prelude to the film."</p></body></html>

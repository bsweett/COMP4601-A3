<meta name="summary" content="The movie was very entertaining and enjoyable"></head><body><p>I liked this movie just as much as I did the first one. I thought that Disney did a very good job at the story and the movie did capture the period of the time. There was a little problem that I did see in the movie and that was it did drag a little bit at times in the movie. But, it isn't that noticable and the humor kept it going through out. I recommend this movie to the Pirates of the Carribbean fans. It is just as good or better than the first one.</p></body></html>

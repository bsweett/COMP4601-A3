<meta name="summary" content="A lot better than you may think"></head><body><p>For a monster movie, this is a great film.<br /><br />The premise is simple, a mist (that spawns all types of monsters) surrounds a supermarket, trapping patrons inside. When somebody goes outside, they get killed in gruesome fashion. While it may appear that there is safety inside, since it is a grocey store , with big plate-glass windows, it is just a matter of time before the monsters get in. What I just described is your basic silly monster movie. The premise is ridiculous and it is unimportant what caused this phenomenon.<br /><br />What makes this movie good, is that the focus is on how the people inside of the grocery store try to cope with each other. There is betrayal, hysteria, allegiances and other relationships which actually is the primary focus of the film. There is a pragmatic and doting father with his son, a crazy religous zealot, mindless small-town yahoos, a pompous lawyer and other representatives of opposite polarities which make the human survivors much more monstrous towards each other than the dinosaur/monsters lurking outside. Like George Romero from "Night of the Living Dead", some of the melodramatic conflict is a metaphor for real life issues like racism, religous fanaticism, zenophobia and desperation.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT. The main knock on this movie is the extremely dark and downer of an ending. The ending is not typical of a mainstream "happy ending". The ending is not stupid and it is consistent with the plot and progession of the characters. I think the ending is not appreciated because this was a cheesy monster movie with a real serious and emotional ending.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is better than 90% of horror movies out there.</p></body></html>

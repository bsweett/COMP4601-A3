<meta name="summary" content="Classic Films, But Slightly Disappointing Extras."></head><body><p>I'll try to make this short, as this site doesn't allow more than 300 words on the reviews.<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK<br /><br />This film is the classic and quintessential "Indiana Jones" film. Great storyline, top-notch acting, rousing music (especially the famous<br />"Raiders March"), hair-raising action sequences and superb directing. Rated PG for action violence and mild language.<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM<br /><br />The second (though chronologically the first) movie in the series is the darkest in the franchise. Good storyline, excellent acting, rousing music terrific drecting and some ideas originally conceived for "Raiders." Interesting sidenote: Kate Capshaw and Steven Spielberg married soon after this movie wrapped. Rated PG for some intense action violence.<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE<br /><br />This third movie in the successful franchise is the lightest. The cast includes Bond villain Julian Glover, Bond girl Alison Doody, "Stand By Me" 's River Phoenix (as a young Indiana Jones in a prologue) and the original James Bond Sean Connery. Packed with action and comedy, this movie is one of the best. Rated PG for action violence and some language (in my opinion; the movie was unfairly smacked with a PG-13 rating).<br /><br />The extras are slightly disappointing. The production featurettes and documentaries are terrific, though shockingly brief. However, there are no deleted scenes. What a letdown. It would've been nice to see what was deleted from the film and to hear why the scenes were cut.</p></body></html>

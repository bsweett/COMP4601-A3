<meta name="summary" content="blu ray is the best you are going to get probably."></head><body><p>This is a good blu ray.  NO doubt about it. They did a fine job with the print here as far as cleaning it up. But it is a 80 year old movie so you can't expect it to look like a newer flick. Still the extras are good on this one ,and one of the cinemas alltime greats deserved this treatment. It's not perfect but at least it's not a scratched up mess! Like lets say 'galaxina' or a dirty print like 'kelly's heroes'. However I would say that if  you love old movies like this one and I bet even some people that are young today still love this old movie with it's stop motion effects too, then you will be pleased with this blu ray. It's as good as we can expect at this date with a film this old. Picture wise I was impressed mostly but then I have seen prints from movies from the 90's that looked all beat up on blu ray. This is more classy; but don't expect the clarity in all scenes that a modern movie would have.</p></body></html>

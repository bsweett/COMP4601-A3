<meta name="summary" content="Cold-hearted thriller examines society's 'moral vacuum'"></head><body><p>SE7EN<br /><br />(USA - 1995)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)<br />Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS<br /><br />On the eve of retirement, a world-weary cop (Morgan Freeman) teams up with his younger replacement (Brad Pitt) in the hunt for a monstrous serial killer whose crimes are based on the seven deadly sins.<br /><br />Dark, gruesome shocker which set director David Fincher on the road to Hollywood glory following an inauspicious debut with the half-baked sci-fi shocker ALIEN?. Freeman loans dramatic weight to the proceedings as a burnt-out cop struggling to make sense of the horrors he has witnessed during his long career, and Pitt distances himself from the 'pretty-boy' roles in which he had become typecast by playing a complex, headstrong character whose flaws lead to a devastating climactic 'twist'. The drama unfolds in an unnamed city where moral values have been replaced by human apathy and excess, allowing the killer at the heart of the story to fester unnoticed, until his monstrous scheme begins to overwhelm the central characters. In fact, Andrew Kevin Walker's ingenious script works both as a police procedural and as an examination of society's moral vacuum, though the downbeat ending may strike some as too neat and cynical for its own good.<br /><br />The movie is quite shocking in places - the killing derived from the sin of 'lust' is particularly degrading - though it's also quite playful in its own twisted fashion (note, for instance, how the constant rainfall surrenders to bright sunlight for the horrific finale), and Darius Khondji's elegant widescreen cinematography often belies the movie's grim subject matter. A triumph for all concerned, this is as close as 1990's Hollywood ever came to a 'daring' mainstream blockbuster, and nervous viewers are urged to avoid at all costs.</p></body></html>

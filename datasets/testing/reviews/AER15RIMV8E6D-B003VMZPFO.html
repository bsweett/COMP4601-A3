<meta name="summary" content="One Crazy Remake!!!"></head><body><p>I thought this movie was a lot better than the 1973 original. I don't hate the original, but I found it really boring. This movie was more suspenseful and creepy. A toxin by the name of Trixie contaminates the water of Ogden Marsh, a small farming town in Iowa. Soon, everybody starts becoming crazy and killing each other. Some are not infected, such as David and Judy Dutton. The Government comes and quarantines almost everybody to stop the disease from spreading. Throughout the film, David and Judy try to avoid the Government and kill any crazy people that get in their way. If you wanna get down with the sickness, you may enjoy THE CRAZIES!!!</p></body></html>

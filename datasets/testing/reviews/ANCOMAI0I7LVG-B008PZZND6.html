Many would argue that it's only because of it's taboo subject matter or controversy but in the end, after the dust has settled and the smoke has cleared `Brokeback Mountain' is more than just a superlative talking point, it's a monumental powerhouse of a motion picture, from it's brilliant script to it's earth shattering acting to it's award winning directing.  At it's very core `Brokeback Mountain' is a story about life as we see it, live it and need it and it reaches to the heartstrings of much more than would be expected.  This is far deeper than `gay cinema' as some have labeled it but is modern cinema at its finest and teaches valid and life changing points that everyone can learn from despite their orientation and or morality.<br /><br />The film, based of Annie Proulx's short story, centers around the lives of two sheepherders Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist.  The two meet when they are but eighteen, Ennis engaged to his sweetheart Alma and Jack just trying to find himself.  They spend the summer together on Brokeback Mountain, herding sheep and albeit unintentionally falling in love.  The film setting begins in the early sixties and advancing twenty-some-odd-years before its conclusion and throughout the notion of repressed sexual feelings it made apparent. It's not culturally acceptable for these two men to even entertain the idea of loving and or being together, and so after their summer-long affair they go their separate ways, Ennis to marry Alma and Jack to eventually find and fall for Lureen.  Years later, after the births of their children, the memory of their affair still plagues them, not in regret of action but in regret of leaving it alone for so long and so they start up again, rekindling a flame that could only end in tragedy.<br /><br />The film is less a `gay love story' and more a universal cry for love in the most complex of terms.  This film proves that you can't pick the one you love but that the thoughts and feelings of those around us, whether it be close family, friends or the idea of a culture in whole can and will affect our decisions to whom and how to love.  While I feel that Jack Twist's character is and was a homosexual man I feel that Ennis was more or less a man you found love in a place he least expected it.  He never sought after the attention of other men as Jack did.  In fact even after Alma leaves him he still seeks the affection of a woman, but Jack and Jack alone had stolen his heart.  That's what's so moving and inspiring about this film is that it parades the truth that love is love and one must embrace that love of lose all happiness they could ever know.<br /><br />What helps elevate this film so far above the competition is the brilliant acting on the entire cast, a cast of young talented stars who blew up in such a big way by taking on such a mature film.  Looking at the roster one may not believe they could handle the material but everyone involved is stellar.  Ledger plays Ennis with such restraint and precise confusion that one is brought to tears almost as much for Ledgers star turn as he is for the tragedy wrapped within his character.  Ledger creates a performance that stays with you.  Gyllenhaal also manages to brilliantly create a character we can relate to.  Jack Twist is someone we know and maybe even a little bit of each of us, a man who just wants to live his life and doesn't care what the consequences.  Death to him is a fair enough price to pay for freedom.  Michelle Williams is a revelation as Alma, her pain, her subtle emotion, her breakdown and her silently unraveling sanity is as moving as it is astonishing to watch.  Anne Hathaway, while not receiving the critical attention of her co-stars delivers a brilliant performance and deserves to be recognized.  Her performance as Lureen may not have been as baity as the character given to Williams, but she maneuvers her character through her scenes with a maturity that she is recently blossoming into.<br /><br />Visually stunning and emotionally captivating `Brokeback Mountain' is a movie that demands to be seen and taken seriously and is one that will stay with the viewer for years even decades to come.  We feel the pain in Ennis' gut as he falls to his knees in despair over leaving Jack.  We feel the torment in Alma's eyes as she watches the man she loves embrace another man.  We feel the frustration in Jack's demeanor as he pleads for Ennis to stay with him, give him anything more than an annual escapade.  But most of all we feel our own heart breaking and setting as we realize how this film and it's very essence effect us in ways we'd never imagine.  Gay, straight, male or female we have all met our Ennis or Jack and maybe even let him or her go because of outside influence or confusion of heart.  May this tragic tale of love denied and love lost move us to never let that happen to us again.</p></body></html>

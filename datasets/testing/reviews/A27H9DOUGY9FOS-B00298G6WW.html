<meta name="summary" content="Defying Conventions--This Hitman Comedy Is Also A Refreshingly Original Character Study"></head><body><p>I had moderate expectations for "The Matador." I had heard some good reviews, especially for Pierce Brosnan for sending up his James Bond persona. Expecting a full-out comedy of a has-been hitman, I instead got a thoughtful, and funny, character study. Utilizing aspects of buddy comedy, slapstick, and thrillers--"The Matador" weaves together a story of two men, essentially, at crossroads in their lives. They come together out a certain necessity and form a strange bond that neither knew they needed. I really enjoyed this story, it's one of the bigger surprises I've had in a while. This film has a heart and subtlety that I hadn't expected, but certainly welcomed.<br /><br />The story really gets going in Mexico. Kinnear is trying to land a big account, and Brosnan is also there on "business." Brosnan's in a bit of a slump, having botched a previous job and realizing he's alone for his birthday. None of his usual diversions (drinking and sex) are helping, so he befriends Kinnear at the hotel bar. The two form a tentative relationship which escalates when Brosnan reveals his occupation. At first, Kinnear is skeptical, then fascinated, and then somewhat disturbed. The two share some escapades around town and when Brosnan asks for Kinnear's help on a "job," the two have a falling out. Some months later, Brosnan shows up at Kinnear's home. There is some unfinished business between the two, and I won't reveal more than that.<br /><br />The pleasure in "The Matador" comes primarily from the character development. I think that many people approached this film expecting a ribald comedy (and there are very strong comedic aspects), but the film works largely as a study of friendship and male bonding. Watching the evolution of the relationship between Kinnear and Brosnan is the film's strong point. These two are put in the most outlandish situations, and yet, the performances ground the characters in a subtle reality. It's as if the "wacky" plot development is secondary to a refreshingly believable interaction between two disparate personalities. It's really quite rare, and most unexpectedly pleasurable.<br /><br />Much has been made of Brosnan's performance. Earning him critical accolades, he is a bit of a burnt-out Bond--an emotional and lonely mess. But I also want to mention Kinnear. This ranks with his top work (which must be "Auto Focus"), and the film would not have succeeded without his adept portrayal. Add indie favorite Hope Davis as Kinnear's wife, and you couldn't ask for a better performed film. I had hoped to like "The Matador," but I also respect it. In other hands, I feel this film could have gone terribly wrong. As is, though, it's a real genre-busting treat. KGHarris, 01/07.</p></body></html>

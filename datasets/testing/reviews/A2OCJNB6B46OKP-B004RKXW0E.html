<meta name="summary" content="Quite possibly the best Disney Animated Film...EVER!"></head><body><p>First and foremost if you are actually reading this and you haven't seen it, get up off your ass and go to the theater right now! I know it is still playing in a theater somewhere!<br /><br />It has been 11 years since we have seen these characters and I will say when I heard about a script in the works for the third chapter I was a bit skeptical for many reasons. Apparently this movie started out as a direct to DVD release when first conceptualized about...4/5 years ago. It was not going to be in CGI and the plot was about Woody and the gang rescuing Buzz from Japan after he and other first edition Buzz Lightyear figures were recalled to the manufacture. Yea, that could have worked, but this is Toy Story! I mean when we all went to see this movie about 15 years ago we were just awestruck by these unbelievable characters. The movie was full of such magic and the story was so original that is just made you think about your own Toys and how great they felt when you played with them. I know I am going on and on, but that just shows you how meaningful Toy Story is to me and film as a whole.<br /><br />Toy Story 3, does not meet up to the grandeur of its predecessors. Toy Story 3 goes above and beyond anything that this story has given us so far. Toy Story 3 turns this simple little world into a massive epic, and the story itself while it may be so simple and easy to follow, there are just so many different emotional levels seen throughout. There are points in the movie where you will laugh so hard and then in the following scene you will be trying so hard to hold back tears. In the theater I was in, I saw grown men cry. For that to happen because of a movie, it just shows you there is something truly special here. The Pixar animation has come so far since Toy Story, that the textures and scenery that you see in this installment are so believable and lifelike you can almost touch them yourself. The voice acting is fantastic as well. Along with the story, the cast returns and steps up their game as well. Each character is given so much more depth and the funnier members of the bunch get even funnier. On top of that we are introduced a whole new batch of toys. Each one is unique in its own way and the new actors that lent their voices did a wonderful job, it was as almost as if there were there from the start. There are not many jokes that play on satire or pop culture like Shrek, but the humor that is used just works. The movie is great for all ages, but I believe it was really made for those that have been there from the beginning. You can tell by some of the scenes that it is not only because you have known these characters growing up, but it is the fact that you are now seeing these characters as a grown up and how you must have felt when you realized it was time to stop playing with your own toys and if they were like these characters what they must be feeling. On that note, probably the best part of this film would have to be the ending. I don't think I have seen a story end on such a high note since 'Return of the King' It just makes you feel so many different kinds of wonderful emotions. The feelings that you leave with towards these characters, in fact the entire legacy that Toy Story has become, you could not have asked for a more proper send off.<br /><br />Now, after reading this I sure hope that if you haven't seen Toy Story 3 that you will. Brush up on your Toy Story and Toy Story 2, because when you see Toy Story 3 you will be very glad you did. Pixar really has outdone them selves with this film. As a person who has seen almost every Disney animated film and who owns every Pixar film, Toy Story 3 could arguably be the greatest Disney animated film ever made! This movie has been praised by fans and critics everywhere since its theatrical release. It makes me wonder where the Pixar gang will go with future projects, some of which will be sequels to other Pixar classics. In fact I don't think 2010 can possibly give us anything better in film! I have already seen Inception and I have to say that Toy Story just adds that little bit of extra magic. Toy Story 3 to me at this point is the best film of 2010, it has surpassed The Incredibles as my all time favorite Pixar film. I sure hope that this film wins the Oscar for Best Picture of the year, yea I am going to stick to that last statment because a film like Toy Story 3 is why we go to see movies and purchase them in the first place. Not only do we want to be entertained, or just escape the hardships of every day life, in the end what we truly want from the films is that sense of perfection that goes deep within our souls. While that feeling maybe different for everyone if you find that feeling it just sets everything right in the world. Like Peter Jackson, John Lassater deserves his credit that has been due to him ever since he created Toy Story. To get an award as prestigious as the Oscar for best film will show the world that animation can be just as real as live action and if you just have the desire and the passion to create something special that is not depicted by something that is entirely real, you can sure as hell do the best that you can to make it real.<br /><br />BUY THIS MOVIE!!!</p></body></html>

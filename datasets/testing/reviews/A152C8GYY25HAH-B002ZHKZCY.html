<meta name="summary" content="An over-the-top, first rate spy thrill"></head><body><p>The spy thriller is very alive and well in "The Bourne Supremacy", one of the most entertaining and well-crafted movies of 2004. It's a sequel to 2002's "The Bourne Identity". In many ways it surpasses the original.<br /><br />The movie, which has a sweeping panorama of international locales, opens in India, where Jason Bourne [Matt Damon] is living with his lover, Marie [Franka Potente]. He still has amnesia, but is often awakened by nightmares about his past as a CIA agent. Meanwhile, a CIA agent is killed in Berlin. One clue is left behind by the killer - a finger print belonging to Bourne. How can this be? Bourne was 4000 miles away. Soon, Bourne is caught up in a conspiracy full of deception and dead bodies.<br /><br />Damon is again perfect as Bourne. His performance is central to the success of the movie. His is essentially a despicable character [at least as far as we know] but he makes us feel a great deal of empathy for Bourne. He is ably supported by two great actors, Joan Allen and Brian Cox, who play CIA agents out to get him.<br /><br />The drama side of "The Bourne Supremacy" is balanced by a great deal of satisfying action. For example, a car chase through the streets of Moscow that ranks as one of the most exciting ever made.</p></body></html>

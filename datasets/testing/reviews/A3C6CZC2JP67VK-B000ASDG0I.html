The story starts out with the telling of why the Smith's marriage is failing apart. Thru the eyes of a marriage counselor. The Smiths who both are assassins for hire. Both discover their mates' true nature then the sparks fly. Vince Vaughn, whom I truly enjoyed, plays a fellow assassin and John Smith best friend.<br /><br />The ending of the movie was a bit unrealistic to me and closure between them was missing something. The movie just falls apart at the end just a little. They argue and talk about their marriage during shoot-outs which can be annoying at times. Then there's a time that the shoot out last too long which makes it unrealistic.  Seriously I mean the movie just ends after a shoot-out that's not that involving or believable.<br /><br />The movie probably needed a main villain. The movie is just about their marriage though and I guess it would've lost focus a little if their was a main villain. Still though it needed something besides them just killing soldier after soldier that come after them. I really liked this movie and I'm happy that I purchased the DVD. It is far from perfect, but quite enjoyable nonetheless, so I will give it 4 stars out of 5. "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is a good source of entertainment and that's good enough for me.</p></body></html>

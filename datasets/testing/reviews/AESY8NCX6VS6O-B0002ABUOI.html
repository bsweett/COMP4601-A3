I, do, though, know when I hate a movie and when I love it, and oddly enough I can't say either about Dawn of the Dead. It's one of those strange, middle-of-the-road movies that I liked enough to sit through, but disliked it enough to not really recommend it to anyone. For one, the movie has enough character development for three typical slasher films, and it might surprise you to know that the whole middle stretch of the film favors that over gore. And it's a welcome change that only occasionally tried my patience. But all the sitting in the mall and fending off the zombies eventually comes to an end, and the movie comes to where it unfortunately stumbles: its long, drawn-out, completely overdone conclusion that you just eventually hope gets the hell over. For a movie that was doing so well up until that point, it commits the sin of overkill and just crams as much in as it possibly can...including over the end credits. Please, would someone tell me why in the hell some directors must stretch the conclusion of their film all the way through the end titles? I think it's called 'lack of talent,' and for all of the intelligent, promising things in Dawn of the Dead, it's the overkill and that finale that takes it from a B- to a GRADE: C+</p></body></html>

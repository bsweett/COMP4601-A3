But it drops a big hint.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" is a wonderful exercise in the use of CGI and digital processing to create a film with a unique visual style. But as a drama with a surprise ending, it's less than satisfactory.<br /><br />The problem is with dialog that telegraphs the ending. When Eisenheim asks Sophie if she wishes to run away with him, she replies that Leopold will hunt them down and kill them, no matter where they go. Given that they're obviously intelligent people, and they understand exactly how Leopold will react, the ending is all too predictable.<br /><br />The acting and directing are nothing if not exquisite, fully matching the magnificent art direction and scenes of period Vienna. Note how when Inspector Uhl feels the hands of Sophie's corpse to see if she really is dead, the director does nothing to draw our attention to it. He assumes the audience is paying attention, and is intelligent enough not to need having Uhl's actions explained.<br /><br />I suspect the implicit anti-Semitism of Leopold's hatred of Eisenheim (who's Jewish) and the line "Make us disappear!" anticipate the anguish of the millions of Jews who would be exterminated 40 years later. But the film doesn't acknowledge or develop these implications.<br /><br />By the way, the orange-tree illusion was created by the French illusionist Robert Houdin, the magician Houdini named himself after.</p></body></html>

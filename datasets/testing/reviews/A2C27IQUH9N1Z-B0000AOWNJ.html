<meta name="summary" content="triumph of style over substance"></head><body><p>I'd give this stylish thriller 5 stars for cinematography and 3 stars for its thriller value.  An interesting premise (based on the Japanese horror film Ringu) and haunting, provocative images ultimately fail to horrify, weakened in the editing room.  The music and the look of the film are chic and edgy --  I'd buy the soundtrack and put stills on my desktop, but I never did get scared, as the impact of horrific images or revelations was often weakened by a confused structure or goofy plot devices.  The ambience was a lot scarier than the plot.  <p>Extras include a nicely done 15-minute movie that incorporates deleted scenes along with Lynch-ian b&amp;w cuts from the video that may be proving fatal to the film's unfortunate but attractive citizens.  Naomi Watts is no Cate Blanchett, but she comports herself believably in the role of an intelligent if emotionally stunted heroine.  The film can be heard in English or French and subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish.  You can also see trailers for Ringu, 8 Mile and Catch Me If You Can.  No commentary track.</p></body></html>

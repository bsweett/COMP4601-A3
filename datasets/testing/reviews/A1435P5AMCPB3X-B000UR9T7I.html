<meta name="summary" content="Another Movie in the Spidey Line, worth a look"></head><body><p>If you are a fan of the other two movies, then this will be a bit of a slower movie, and a slight let down, but still well worthy of four stars.  There are some really corny parts that are hard to take, but otherwise, this has the action, the back story, and decent characters to boot.  There are a few to many villians at one point, and it feels like the movie rushes all at once to try and give everyone their place, but still runs together well overall.  Check this film out in the theaters, worth buying on DVD.</p></body></html>

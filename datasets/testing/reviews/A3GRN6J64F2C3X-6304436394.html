<meta name="summary" content="Hollywood-ized sequel to indie hit still worth a gander."></head><body><p>Robert Rodriguez's bigger-budget sequel to his surprise hit "El Mariachi" demonstrates that more money and more polish don't necessarily equal a better movie.  Still, one can't deny that "Desperado" is still pretty watchable.  There's good action, some funny moments (mostly courtesy of Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino), and the undeniable beauty of Salma Hayek.  The thing goes on a little too long, however, for a movie that basically just wants to entertain you with a succession of cleverly conceived and shot action sequences.  Kudos to the DVD image, though: it's blisteringly sharp and clear.  The extras are good, too.</p></body></html>

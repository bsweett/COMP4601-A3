<meta name="summary" content="Cinderella Man on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>I must say that I loved this movie and originally bought the standard edition, now upgraded it to the Blu Ray version.  Won't get into summarizing the story lines as, when I buy a DVD, I already know the movie and am only interested in the quality of the DVD itself.<br /><br />The video transfer is one of the very best I have seen.  The depression era sepia colors look as natural and balanced as one could ever expect and I saw no video noise or aliasing.  To my eyes, this video transfer is simply outstanding.  The DTSHD audio was crisp and clear.  However, the sound editors appeared to mux the rear channels, used especially for the arena crowd scenes, into one output.  In other words, the audio in the rear channels did not sound as if the rears were discreet channels.  There were no whistles coming from the right while a shout came from the left.  It sounded as if whatever came out of one came out of the other as well.  On this score, I was a bit disappointed as audio is very important to me and too many companies scrimp on the audio end of editing.  Front left and right channels were used discreetly tho sparingly as, other than the fight scenes, this is a dialogue driven film.<br /><br />There are a ton of excellent extras, most from 2005, and even a newsreel of the original heavyweight championship match between Braddock and Baer.  I read some time ago that Baer's son hated the way his father was portrayed.  The acting was excellent all around and Russell Crowe even moved and looked like the real Cinderella Man.  Renee Zellweger's performance was the most sincere I have ever seen her and she should have gotten more attention for this.  The only bad extra amongst many was a Kodak Gallery which was little more than an advertisement for them and contributed nothing.  However, you will find that all the other extras will retain your interest and enthusiasm.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

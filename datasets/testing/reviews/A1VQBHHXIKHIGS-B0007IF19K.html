<meta name="summary" content="Ray"></head><body><p>Any movie about Ray Charles is guaranteed to have a fantastic soundtrack. What else? First of all, Jamie Foxx became Ray Charles. He was a pleasure to watch. Next, since we have childhood flashbacks, we must have a credible young actor. We do. The kid's great. Next, the story. Yep, we've got that. No sugar coating of the lows and an excellent job of sharing the highs. It's a fine, fine movie. It focused on the early years, before rehab, and probably simplified some things to fit into only 2.5 hours. So, not perfect. But very good. Well worth watching.<br /><br />Possibly the funniest moment is this. White kids on the beach trying to sing the orgasmic call-and-response of "What'd I Say" as if it were something from a Frankie Avalon/Annette Funicello movie. Hilarious.<br /><br />DVD bonus features include a jam session between Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx. Unfortunately, that didn't work on my Chinese version. I hear Foxx is a talented musician himself, and that he showed this to the Grammy audience recently. I'm not surprised.</p></body></html>

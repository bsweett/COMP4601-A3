<meta name="summary" content="Superior thriller"></head><body><p>An ambitious taxi driver (Jamie Foxx) is forced to be the driver for a hit man (Tom cruise) as he travels across LA eliminating his targets.  This film has one giant plot hole-obviously, any real super-assassin would not depend on his ability to control a random cab driver as the key to an important job where precision timing is the key.  But if you can roll with that, you are in for an extremely entertaining ride.  Foxx (the real star of this film) and Cruise do great work and there are many specific character details that bring the story and people to life in a manner that is uncommon in the action genre.  Director Michael Mann and screenwriter Stuart Beattie acquit themselves well.</p></body></html>

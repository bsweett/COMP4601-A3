In many respects the film "Atonement" is about both these definitions and how they can define a life. When pre-teen Briony (Saoirse Ronan in a spectacular performance) a budding writer catches Robbie (James McAvoy) the bright, young groundskeeper and her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley)having sex in the study she pieces this along with other things she has seen to create a "story" for the police when a crime is committed that rips the two lovers apart.<br /><br />Older and wiser Briony (Romola Garai)tries to make amends and repair her relationship with Cecilia (now a nurse)and Robbie (who is now being sent overseas to fight) as best she can during WWII but finds the road to forgiveness difficult and painful.<br /><br />Screenwriter Christopher Hampton (the scripts for "The Quiet American" and "Dangerous Liaisons") captures the essence of the novel capturing the spirit as well something that is rare for film adaptations from a popular novel. Director Joe Wright ("Pride and Prejudice") is no stranger to the peril of translating a novel to film does a marvelous job of making "Atonement" cinematic in every respect. You'd be forgiven for the mistaken belief that this isn't adapted from another medium.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: "Atonement" looks marvelous in its DVD incarnation with colors that perfectly capture both the pre-War bright colors of the film and the somber tones of London and France during WWII. Detail is sharp and a very nice, smooth film-like quality to the DVD.<br /><br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES:<br />We get a solid batch of special features with "Atonement". The best special feature, however, is director Joe Wright's commentary track which provides intricate detail about the challenges of shooting the film--particularly the amazing tracking shot on the beach of Dunkirk which only took three takes (amazingly) to perfect. It's a good thing, too, since it was shot using Steadicam requiring the camera operator to lug the camera up and down the beach. It's a brilliant sequence easily as cinematic as anything that the Coens or Ridley Scott dreamed up for their big films from last year "No Country for Old Men" and "American Gangster".<br /><br />We also get deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Wright, a solid featurette on the making of the film. The "Novel to the Screen" featurette is pretty interesting as well detailing the challenges of translating the written word to a visual medium without losing the very qualities that made the novel so memorable.<br /><br />The one flaw the film has is that it runs a bit too long and could have been trimmed without losing the dramatic power of the film. That observation is purely subjective however as some people will probably love the film just the way it is.<br /><br />Largely overlooked by Oscar this year, "Atonement" may be a bit stuffy and more conventional on the surface in a Masterpiece Theater way when compared to "No Country for Old Men", "There Will Be Blood" or the experimental "I'm Not There" but that surface is as deceptive as Briony's story. Director Wright and screenwriter Hampton's sly, slick slight of hand in telling this tragic love story is easily as adept as any of those other films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What can i say...its great !"></head><body><p>This is quite a movie folks.  The story is good,  we have 3 travelling lads<br /><br />looking for a good time/sex as most males like to do, but they kind of end<br /><br />up in places they did'nt expect.  The acting is good, the girls are nice<br /><br />and it never gets boring.  The sets and atmosphere are pretty creepy and<br /><br />mixed with the right music.  This is 2007 and now movies will show most<br /><br />gross special effects compared to a decade or two ago. So what we have is<br /><br />is very well done effects that adds to the movie and will probably make<br /><br />your stomach turn a bit.... We have to remember this is only a movie, but<br /><br />in a world where rich people pay for snuff films and other sick things this<br /><br />scenario (i hope not) could or may be happening somewhere ...</p></body></html>

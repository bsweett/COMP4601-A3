Mike White's script is very very strong and well written as I would have expected.  Linklater's direction is spot on throughout particularly in the scenes involving the music.  The kids are astonishing.  All of them should have gotten some kind of ensemble award.  This is a very entertaining film that is definitely worth owning.</p></body></html>

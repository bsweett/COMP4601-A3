What tremendous acting performances and script.  I don't know how this one got by me when it was first released, but it goes down as one of the best comedies of all time.  All 5 stars.  I won't even go into the plot.  Watch it!  Enjoy it!  Laugh, laugh, laugh...then send your comments as a review here at Amazon.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I only have one job on this ship" - Highly Recommended"></head><body><p>"Galaxy Quest" is a fantastic satire on Star Trek and pokes a little fun at Trekies too, but all in good taste.<br /><br />Staring Tim Allen as Commander Taggart, Sigourney Weaver as "Lt. Madison", and Alan Rickman ("Snape' in the Harry Potter movies) as "Dr. Lazarus". Well more acurately, they play actors playing those parts.<br /><br />No spoilers from me, but the movie has a strong plot, good special effects, and is very well acted. The best parts of the movie are the scenes where the writers "nailed" the Trek actors (Shatner comes to mind :-) and the convention crowds.<br /><br />This is a seriously funny movie! Highly Recommended!</p></body></html>

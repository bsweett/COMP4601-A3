<meta name="summary" content="Moving Collage Beyond Karrate Kid and Second Hand Lions"></head><body><p>I got this movie on a whim, in part because I am tired of seeing Americans turning into either fat blobs or pussies afraid of their own shadow (or worse, self-righteous morons who really think government is the answer to everything.<br /><br />Eastwood might hate the comparison, but this is a collage that goes well beyond <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800179501">The Karate Kid</a> meets <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000YTP02">Secondhand Lions (New Line Platinum Series)</a>.<br /><br />It most assuredly is right up there with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JVUHY">Million Dollar Baby (Full Screen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731959">Absolute Power</a>.<br /><br />It's hard to sum up this movie so I will say just three things:<br /><br />1.  He weaves every possible American hard-ass self-made man image in as gracefully as it could be done.<br /><br />2.  He does for the hill people of Viet-Nam what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094AS9U">Bride and Prejudice</a> did for India but without the music, love, and dance.<br /><br />3.  The ending is spectacular--Eastwood's voice in the background, slow singing against a visual as the Gran Torino drives toward the future with its special passenger who inherited from the master.  For this alone I would rent or buy the DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slick In the Line of Fire"></head><body><p>Here Michael Douglas plays the agent that took a bullet for the president and now as an aging Secret Service agent, he must uncover an assassination plot. Fans of "In the Line of Fire", "Enemy of the State", and the "24" TV series should enjoy this fast moving actioner. At first I thought this is another "In the Line of Fire", but the story was different and I actually enjoyed it more even if once again I thought this guys is to old to be secret service.<br /><br />Good cast, sets, directing, and story make this a good one for most the family. The rating suffices it to say there is some adult situations and language. Although you can't help thinking Clint Eastwood and Michael Douglas are to old to playing active agents, you have to give them credit for doing their best. I would be interested to know the mandatory retirement age of agents guarding the president. It unlike many jobs should not be handcuffed by age discrimination. I say that as a member of AARP.</p></body></html>

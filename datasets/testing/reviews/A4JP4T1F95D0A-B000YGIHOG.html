<meta name="summary" content="Zombie Rage"></head><body><p>28 Days Later is a terrific movie.  As far as sequels, this is really top notch.  Though I didn't like it quite as much as the original, it does hold up well when placed beside the original film.  The movie starts with a bang during the height of the infection.  It then gives a brief overview of what has happened from then to now 28 weeks later.  Britain has been decimated by the virus, but now all of the Rage infected have died of starvation and the U.S. army has moved in with about 15,000 refugees and set up a safe zone to start over.  But you know things aren't going to go smoothly and another infection breaks out and all hell breaks loose again.  I liked the sense of unknown in the first film.  Had the virus spread across the world, were they the only people left?  The second film doesn't quite convey that.  The army has the jets and helicopters and you don't quite feel overwhelmed by the thought of the world ending.  The last scene of the movie is great though and I hope for a 28 Months Later follow up.</p></body></html>

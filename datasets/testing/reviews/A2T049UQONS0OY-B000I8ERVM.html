<meta name="summary" content="Three and one half stars: Good throughout until the end, then a letdown"></head><body><p>"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" effectively mixes courtroom drama and affect from "The Exorcism" and other spooky films for a cinematic, or DVD, experience that is enthralling until the very end, when it seems to unwind and turn vanilla.<br /><br />The story traces the actions of a priest that performed an exorcism on the named character and the courtroom drama around his work, which the prosecution suggests led to the girl's death. The courtroom drama  takes up most of the scenes, which are interspersed with reconstructions of Emily's takeover and the exorcism.<br /><br />The film effectively eschews most of the gore, blood and guts that have appeared in many of these movies and is still effective all the way through to the end, where it lets the viewer down by trying to satisfy everyone.<br /><br />Two wonderful actors -- Laura Linney and Campbell Scott -- play the attorneys on each side of the court case in this thriller. Linney, coming off her Oscar-nominated work in "Kinsey" is more multidimensional than I can recall seeing her before. Campbell, a terrific supporting actor who has appeared in a lot of movies, takes on an older, more mature, more conservative appearance in the movie playing a God-fearing lawyer than must bebunk a priest whose actions, he believes, led to Emily's demise.<br /><br />The interaction between the two attorneys in the courtroom is what drives the action in the film. There is a subplot of demonic possession that transcends the titled character, a plot contrivance I've never before seen in an exorcism-takeover movie. It adds somethig fresh to the overall horror production.<br /><br />However, an equivocal ending -- apparently based on what happened in real life (the film is said to be based on true events) -- robs the movie of forward motion, bringing everything to an unengaging stop. It gave me the impression that everything leading up to it was less important than I previously thought.<br /><br />Still, this is an effective thriller with riveting performances by the two lawyers and a convincing plot built around real events. There are epilogue scripts onscreen after the flick that tell you what happened to everyone after the court case.<br /><br />This is a good movie, very effective until the end, where I felt like a deflated balloon. Not all viewers will have this feeling, of course. Check out other reviews for other reactions.</p></body></html>

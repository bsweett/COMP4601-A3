The movie is set in a very specific time and place - a rainy Good Friday in contemporary Manhattan (sometime before 9-11 as we see the World Trade Center and the release date was early 2002). In a morning auto accident hotshot Wall Street lawyer "Gavin" played by a barely adequate Ben Affleck hits a car driven by recovering alcoholic insurance salesman "Doyle" excellently portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson.  Both men are made late for court appearances and Affleck's character has inadvertently left an important legal file with Jackson  causing repercussions that lead to  escalating and improbable acts of revenge during the course of this spring Friday.<br /><br />One of the problems with the film is Affleck is unbelievable as Gavin as he does not impart the intelligence or drive one would expect to see in a rising Wall Street attorney.  One can never imagine him possessing the power and gravitas his father-in law (played by Sydney Pollock) commands as a senior partner.  Both his soft spoken pretty wife (Amanda Peet) and his career girl mistress (Toni Collette) are much stronger and decisive. Furthermore Gavin's "ethics crisis"  seems phony as we are supposed to believe an insider in a high power firm is suddenly opposed to white collar flimflam when he is not above some evil mischief against Doyle or cheating on his wife.  Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as Doyle a man who has anger and alcohol problems but desperately wants to get back in the good graces of his divorcing wife and two sons.  However he is so out of control (in one day we see him throw a computer through a bank window, beat up some characters he meets in a bar, attempt to kill Gavin by loosening his wheel and yell and scream at various other people) even when sober that it is difficult to believe he is functioning at all in life let alone on a job with some responsibility.  The premise of the film is good but the script needs more believability to rise above the typical Hollywood offering.</p></body></html>

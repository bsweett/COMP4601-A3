One was Dr. Strangelove, and it fulfilled my expectations. Young Frankenstein was the other, and this time, I have to say, I was quite wrong. Young Frankenstein is superb all the way around. (It probably helps that I had a recent re-watch of James Whale's Frankenstein under my belt, for those of you who haven't seen it yet.)<br /><br />The plot concerns Dr. Frederick Frankenstein ("that's FRONK-en-shteen") (Gene Wilder), the grandson of Victor, the doctor in the original. He's spent years trying to get rid of the family taint, which all comes spiralling down around him when he inherits the old castle and the accompanying lab. Leaving behind his cloying, uptight fianc&eacute;e Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), he travels to the castle and meets the staff-- Igor (Marty Feldman), Inga (Teri Garr), and Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman). Surreptitiously encouraged by Inga, Frederick becomes obsessed with the idea of repeating the experiments of his grandfather, and soon, the new monster (Peter Boyle) comes to life. The rest of the movie is half homage to James Whale's original and half screwball comedy.<br /><br />The real strength of this movie is the cast; Mel Brooks could've sat back and pointed a camera, and they could make this work. Wilder, Boyle, Feldman, Leachman, Garr, Kahn, Gene Hackman, and Richard Haydn (in his final film) are all either in career-best form of darned close to it here. All are actors with impeccable comic timing (yes, even Gene Hackman), and it often seems as if Brooks just said "okay, do whatever it is you were planning to do, then put it way over the top." The result is in no way a sophisticated comedy; this is just a straightforward gut-buster with dozens, if not hundreds of quotable one-liners and great sight gags. One for the books. ****</p></body></html>

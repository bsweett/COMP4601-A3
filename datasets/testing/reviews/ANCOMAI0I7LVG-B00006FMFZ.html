I guess I really shouldn't, since he won a Directing Oscar on his first shot out the box in 1999, but in this particular case I feel really bad for him.  Much like the Coen brothers in 1990, Sam Mendes made a wonderful Gangster movie that was trampled over by an inferior one; both by Martin Scorsese.  Sure, `Road to Perdition' is no `Miller's Crossing' (which is a masterpiece), but then again `Gangs of New York' is far from `GoodFellas'.  Truth be told though, `Road to Perdition' is much more controlled, complete and enjoyable than that scattered mess Scorsese campaigned for a Best Picture nomination.<br /><br />The film centers on Michael Sullivan, a strong arm for an Irish mob in depression era Chicago.  When his son, Michael Jr., witnesses a murder he becomes a liability, one that John Rooney, Michael's boss, can't allow.  When Michael's wife and youngest son are murdered at the hands of his `family' Michael and his Michael Jr. travel down the road of revenge, vowing to set matters straight.<br /><br />But it is far from an easy journey.<br /><br />Emotionally, `Road to Perdition' has a lot going for it.  It is a film bent on exploiting the contradictions between the life of a mobster and the life of a father.  Michael Sullivan is a man going to hell, but his only desire is that his son makes it to heaven.  While it seems like a simple enough morale, the way in which Mendes transfers it is deeply moving.<br /><br />But the film, above all else, is a technical marvel.<br /><br />`Road to Perdition' is visually stunning, a sublime directorial piece by Mendes.  It reminds me a lot of his recent `Revolutionary Road' in the way he was able to really connect with the era, not just the story.  Everything is so clean and so authentic; from the cars to the d&eacute;cor of the homes to the look of the skin on the man you are staring at.  Everything about this film lives and breathes the era Mendes was attempting to capture.  The score and the glorious set pieces also help in that regard.  Another testament to Mendes's impressive direction is the performances he gets from the ENTIRE cast.  This is one of the strongest ensembles of the year, for each and every player, no matter how small, adds so much to their scenes.  One that is truly impressive is Hanks, who I am vocally NOT a fan of.  What I really appreciated about his performance was the way he very slowly came out of his dark shell.  It was such a realistic and ultimately heartbreaking transition because we saw him become a father for the first time.  This had a lot to do, I'm sure, with Mendes's instructions, and his pacing of the film (while some may find it slow) truly helped establish this man's emotional journey.<br /><br />Hanks is not the only star here though, as I mentioned, everyone is great.  Paul Newman is the films standout, without question.  His paternal conflictions are so reaching and so moving, especially as the film draws to a close.  Jude Law is a horrific mental image who never fades away (giving me chills right now) and Daniel Craig took advantage of his personal charm in creating an arrogant child in a man's body.  Even bit parts like Stanley Tucci's or Jennifer Jason Leigh's or Anthony LaPaglia (who was cut from the film only to make his way back if you catch the right `version') are all spot on.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, this is no `Miller's Crossing'.  The film, while great and far better than Scorsese's overhyped disaster, is not perfect.  I personally did not like the subplot involving the bank robberies and actually found the bizarre approach to those scenes almost off-putting.  They construed the eerie vibe the film was maintaining by trying too hard to insert a comedic edge.  Thankfully it was short-lived, but it is there and that upsets me.  I actually could have gone with a little more length in the film as well; maybe a few more scenes fleshing out the relationship budding between father and son.  I think that it would have aided the film in comparing the relationship between Michael and his son with the relationship between Michael and Rooney, who was obviously a father figure.<br /><br />The film is still stunning in many areas and a very, very engrossing and entertaining film.  I highly recommend this to any fan of the genre or the actors or the director (I am really impressed with his small yet diversified resume), for they are all at the top of their games.</p></body></html>

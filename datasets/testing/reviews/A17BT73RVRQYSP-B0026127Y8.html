<meta name="summary" content="Big Jake in the 21st century"></head><body><p>Liam Neeson becomes a one man avenging angel when his daughter is taken by sex slave traders in Paris during the 21st century .<br /><br />For 20 minutes we establish Neeson as a spook + who loves his daughter but was never there, his wife is has remarried a very rich man and he can't compete with him.  The daughter wants to take a trip overseas with a friend, her father objects but relents with conditions that she ignores.<br /><br />Lucky for her she keeps the phone he gave him and at about the 27 minute mark when she is taken he gives his ultimatum to the man on the other line, his daughter or his life.  As the movie progresses it is clearly established that like the villain in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)</a> he chooses poorly.<br /><br />At this point he is no longer the weaker link in a family squabble, he becomes John Wayne in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CMR4">Big Jake</a> without Maureen O'Hara or sons to back him up.  The locale is different and his foes are not looking for his cash but the quest is the same, the girl alive OR them dead, each and every one of them, but he makes a slight alteration; the  OR becomes an AND.<br /><br />Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YIGND6">Trade</a> we see the inhumanity of the modern slave trade and the indifference of those who practice it.  Unlike trade we get a movie that is meant to entertain and does.<br /><br />It may be less realistic but the results are immensely more satisfying.  He proceeds with no mercy to anyone who would hinder him, it is that lack of mercy or honor that makes this movie even better.<br /><br />If you are a Wayne or Eastwood fan you will enjoy this movie particularly the last half of it.  If you are a Michael Moore fan you will not.<br /><br />Simple as that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek II: The Worth of Khan"></head><body><p>One thing that many serials use to great effect, but is surprisingly missing in the original series of Star Trek, is the recurring villain. They had a sense of that with the recurring Klingons and Romulans, but we never got to see the same people playing the roles in more than one episode. The only antagonist that ever recurred throughout the entire three year run was Harcourt Fenton "Harry" Mudd, and he was a bit of a joke at best.<br /><br />However, as much as you may want to laugh at the idea of Mudd as a "villain", the recurring role allowed the character to become more real. Thus his problems and motivations were more real to us.<br /><br />On the heals of the commercial success of the critically decried "Star Trek: The Almost-No-Motion Picture", director Nicholas Meyer was determined to prove that Star Trek could be a successful and well reviewed movie franchise. Herein came the great idea: use a villain that the audience already knows.<br /><br />Like all original series villains, Khan Noonian Singh was in only one episode. Yet brilliant writing and Montalban's portrayal of the genetically engineered superhuman created one of the greatest episodes of the entire series. By bringing him in to the story, they not only firmly establish that these movies are the continuing voyages of the crew that started out in the sixties, but the audience could now see the results of one of their most favorite episodes ever. Rarely do we get the rest of the story. Here we see it in larger-than-life effects and played out superbly by the inimitable Ricardo Montalban.<br /><br />His hatred of Kirk was believable before he ever mentioned the (then) Admiral's name. There was a terrifying restraint to his deliberate actions, but his eyes always told us that there was much more power and emotion than we were being allowed to see. Shatner gave a wonderful performance in this showdown with a foe he thought to have left behind, but it was Montalban who truly shone through.<br /><br />Superb movie and a wonderful DVD.</p></body></html>

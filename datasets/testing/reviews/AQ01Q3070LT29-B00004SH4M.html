<meta name="summary" content=""No Bond, I expect you to die"!"></head><body><p>Sean Connery returns in the third "James Bond 007" film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K0E6">Goldfinger (Special Edition)</a> (1964).  Creator and Author of James Bond, Ian Fleming died on August 12, 1964, before the films' release.<br /> James Bond's mission is to spy on Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) who Bond is keeping a watchful eye on at the Fountainebleau Hilton Hotel Resort in Miami Beach, Florida.  Goldfinger plays a very sneaky hand of gin.  Bond goes up to Goldfinger's hotel room and finds a black bikini-clad Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) looking through binoculars and the opponent's cards and speaking through an earpiece to Goldfinger. Well, James Bond wins that hand and invites Jill out to dinner as it were.  Actually we see Bond kissing Jill in bed with a bottle of Dom Perignon '53 by the bed side.  In the kitchen, Odd Job (Harold Sakata) knocks Bond out cold.  Later, when Bond comes to, he finds Jill dead on the bed with her body completely painted in gold.  The hunt is on for Auric Goldfinger.<br />  Bernard Lee returns as "M".  Lois Maxwell returns as "Miss Moneypenny", Desmond Llewelyn returns as "Q".<br />  Cec Linder as "Felix Leiter".  Tania Mallet as "Tilly", Burt Kwouk as "Mr. Ling", Honor Blackman as "Pussy Galore".  Les Tremayne (Shazam! tv series) is the voice of the Radio newsman).  Michael G. Wilson plays a "soldier".<br />  The man in the classic gun-barrel opening sequence as 007 shots his gun and blood cascades down, is not Sean Connery, but stuntman Bob Simmons who also appears as a soldier inside Fort Knox in this film.<br />  This is the film that has Sean Connery tied up on the table with a red laser gradually burning up between his legs.<br />  Shirley Bassey performs "Goldfinger".<br /><br /> If the Fontainebleau Hotel looks familiar, you may also have seen it in the Jerry Lewis film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002NY8RQ">The Bellboy</a> (1960).<br /><br />  Other Locations: Burnham Beeches, Stoke Park House, all in Buckinghamshire, England.<br />  Southend (Rockford) Airport and Southend-on-sea, all of Essex, England.<br />Fort Knox, Kentucky.

Miss Eaton is still very much alive.<br /><br /> The nuclear device stops at 003 in the United Kingdom version, but stops at 007 in the American version.<br /><br /> 2007 DVD Frame by Frame Restoration:<br /><br /> Option of Language: English Dolby Digital 5.1, English dts, English (Mono), French.<br /> Option of Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Thai.<br /><br /> Audio Commentary #1 with Director Guy Hamilton.<br /> Audio Commentary #2 with cast & Crew.<br /> Commentary Subtitles: Chinese, Koren, Thai.<br /><br />  James Bond returns in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K0E9">Thunderball (Special Edition)</a> (1965).<br /><br /> SKYFALL will be released November 9, 2012.</p></body></html>

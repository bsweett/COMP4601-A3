<meta name="summary" content="Another Under-Appreciated One - A Fine Horror Thriller"></head><body><p>I was really surprised to like this movie so much.  It didn't seem like a good choice for a remake, and the trailers made it look like it was going to be a possibly-too-slick, mainstream-ized, and frankly dumb, version of the original.  Instead I found the actual movie to be a smart, well-crafted horror thriller.  While it wouldn't make my Top Ten for 2006 by any means, I thought (although I'm clearly in the minority here, judging by its overall low rating) it was a very succsessful remake.<br /><br />  I thought it was a succsessful remake largly because of this: it does something different with the original material.  If you're going to remake something, I think you should take some different paths so the two versions are distinct from one another.  The 1973 original focused on a Christianity vs. evil paganism theme; today paganism isn't viewed with nearly the same distrust and misconceptions as it was decades ago, and in this remake has been replaced with a strange new religion apparantly created just for the movie.  The Christianity element has been eliminated altogether for whatever reason; I wouldn't have minded if it had stayed but that wasn't the way they decided to go.<br /><br />  The rest of the premise is the same as the original - Nicolas Cage is a policeman drawn to the island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a little girl on the island.  Edward Woodward made that role in the original his own, and here Cage plays the role in a totally different manner; even the name of the character has been changed.  Once on the island, Cage finds the locals uncooperative to the point of denying the little girl ever even existed.  The island is ruled over by the outwardly benign Sister Summerisle, played by Ellen Burstyn - another change: in the original it was Lord Summerisle, played by Christopher Lee.  In any remake of a movie that featured Lee, the recasting of his character is going to be tricky (I'm not counting Dracula movies; there have been so many different incarnations of the Count over the last hundred years that they don't really count as remakes of any previous film, and haven't for a long time) and in this case they went so far in differentiating the roles as to change gender.  Which ends up a good thing, with having a 'queen bee' type of figure tying right into the mythology of the island and its religion.  The islanders are fixated on bees, the creature they keep for harvesting honey, although I suppose the question of who's really keeping who could be argued, if you want to read between the lines.  The bee motif plays out in the movie in ways alternately subtle and overt, and made for a fascinating mythology and backdrop.  The officer's investigations lead him to quickly conclude that the girl did indeed exist, and that a large part of the island is covering up not only her death but her life as well.  Cut off from the outside world in a society with no link to the mainland, he attempts to find out what happened, and whether she may even still be among the living.  With performances that are far better than they've been given credit for, and a nice tight tension throughout, I give this one a strong recommendation.  8/10</p></body></html>

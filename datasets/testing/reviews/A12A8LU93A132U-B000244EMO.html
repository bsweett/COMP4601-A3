<meta name="summary" content="Shouldn't get highest rating for picture or sound quality"></head><body><p>I wanted to comment on the Widescreen Review of the picture and sound quality. I think the highest rating should be reserved for quality that is perfect in every way. There were a few short minor scenes where the picture  looked grainy and I found very easy to pick up. I also had a weird sound  change where background noise disappears (ie sound of burning wood) in the  middle of some dialogue that had me rewinding wondering if I has hearing or  not hearing things, as the case may be. None-the-less, the picture quality  and sound is excellent where it counts and all this DVD could use is maybe  some more extras. A decent DVD to have in any collection.</p></body></html>

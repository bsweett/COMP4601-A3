<meta name="summary" content="another kevin smith masterpiece"></head><body><p>Just like Mallrats, the cover kicks ass!!! The special features in this dvd isn't too shaby either. Theres not really much of a featurette, but it includes over an hour of deleted scenes. This movie makes you think. The best scenes are between Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. I can't believe I mentioned Ben Affleck and a "good scene" together in the same sentance. The only films he's ever good in are Kevin Smith movies. Jay and Silent Bob are funny in this too. The weird thing about this movie is knowing what to classify it under. Comedy? Drama? Action? You need to see this movie!!!!!and buy it.....</p></body></html>

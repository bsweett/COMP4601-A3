<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Movie!"></head><body><p>There is one word to describe this movie.Awesome (or breathtaking). I have never seen Kurt Russell play a better role.<br />Wilford Brimley adds to the quality of this film. The real show stopper is the monster that has invaded the base that they are on.This monster has the ability to transform into any living creature. All of the transformations done by the monster in this film are something to behold.This movie is scary as well as being very exciting. This movie will definitely hold your<p>attention. Buy this movie and watch it. You will never forget it.<br />It is definitely a classic.</p></body></html>

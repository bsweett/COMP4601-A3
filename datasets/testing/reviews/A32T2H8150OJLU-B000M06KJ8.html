<meta name="summary" content="A movie that couldn't decide what it wanted to be..."></head><body><p>I watched Marie Antoinette for the first time last night, and was it ever a snoozer!  I mean, I like dramatic period films, e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMQG">Amazing Grace</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth (Spotlight Series)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018C705M">Horatio Hornblower: Collector's Edition</a>, etc., but this film was, um, there's no way to say this gently...flat.<br /><br />OK, I admit that I was somewhat fascinated by the recreation of life in the French Court of Louis XVI, but that's about it.<br /><br />I did hang in there and watch the whole thing, but as the film progressed I was struck by the thought that the film-makers couldn't quite decide what they wanted this film to be.  For a while it seemed like a solid period drama, a but slow, a bit flat, but a drama.  Then the diretor seemed to change direction, and the combination of filming and music (e.g., during some of the carriage scenes) reminded me of some rather bad 1960s films, back in the day when film-making was striving to be "artsy" at the expence of watchability (is this a word?  well, whatever), and then there were times when it looked like the director was shooting music video for MTV.  It was hard to keep up.  It all seemed somewhat disjointed.<br /><br />All in all, I have to say that it was "OK."  I doubt that I will ever watch it again, but 3 stars is all I can give it in good conscience.<br /><br />3 stars...too little acting, too little character development, too little consistency in filming and soundtack, so, it was just adequate...3 stars.</p></body></html>

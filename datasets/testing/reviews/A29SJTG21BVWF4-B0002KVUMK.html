This film is not one of the top Dracula fims that has been made.  Were, we have a plotline that follows Van Helsing going around the world trying to save it from all kind of beasts and demons for the catholic church.  However,  the movie does a poor job on portraying the character Van Helsing as a heroic character and as a savoir of humanity.  The character of Dracula is spinned off into a new direction of coming to be a vampire, its not from hatred of the catholic church because of a lost love as in the book.  But is made a vampire because he made a deal with the devil for immortality as long as he serves the devil on earth.  Which is not to enticing of a character storyline but still ties into the movie in general.<br /><br />  Kate Beckinsale does a horrible job with her eastern europe accent but still manages to make a decent attempt at acting as the movie love interest/co-hero of Van Helsing.<br /><br />  Furthermore, this movie is driven by the special effects that so many big budget movies are.  Which in turn, like so many before it,  lack a true plotline.  Where the characters are bound to the typical actions of a hero storyline.  Although there are a some well timed humor and decent acting from the main characters, that make this movie an enjoyable and entertaining movie to watch.<br /><br />  The Special Effects in of themselves are actually really good.  With amazing footage and computer generated scenes makes the movie into a great spectical.  It does capture the goth life style that was prominate during that time period and setting the mood for each scene.  For that this movie gets an A-minus.<br /><br />  The Directing of this movie was well thought out and done beautifully but could not save this film enough to make it a classic film or even a good film.  Although it is an entertaining movie to say the least.  A good movie to rent when you and your friends want to sit down and have a movie marathon.</p></body></html>

But I watched it again today for the first time in ages, and it reminded me how great this is and how much of a classic it is.  You have to see this.  I can't imagine anyone that wouldn't love it.  It's a classic from a classic director.  Quentins mind is warped in a great way and only he could pull this off.  It's funny and so well written.  You have to see this.  It's one of the best movies ever made.  John Travolta et al are amazing.  They did such a good job on this.  GO AND SEE IT.  You'll love it.  It's 2 hours and 30 minutes of excellence.</p></body></html>

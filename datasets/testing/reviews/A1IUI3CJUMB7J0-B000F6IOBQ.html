<meta name="summary" content="A fun gory action sequal"></head><body><p>I have never seen the first movie and I do not really like vampire movies so I was surprised that I liked this film. The film explains what happend in the first movie in the first 5 min so i kinda understood what I missed, but at times I was lost and had to ask my friend some questions. The movie is enjoyable for thriller or action fans. The movie has lots of gore and is really dark. The story is action packed and dosent stop. The acting is pretty good for an action/thriller movie. Overall I enjoyed this film with all the gore action and scary parts.</p></body></html>

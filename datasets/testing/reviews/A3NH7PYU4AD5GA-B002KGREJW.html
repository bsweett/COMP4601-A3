America does understand America after all. I have hope.<br /><br />This movie is as black a piece of humour as you can find. Possibly not even the title hero is quite right in her mind, but let us be generous. She is cute. The most so when she loses her mind over having qualified for the finals.<br /><br />The rest of the family has been accurately summarized as "dysfunctional". What a nice word.

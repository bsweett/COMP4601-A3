But the gore gets reptative, the characters are two dimensional and the plot . . .well, actually there's not too bad on plot. this one ends differently than the original. Way different. On a sharp note you might say. But I would have liked it much more if they used more items in the mall. All they ever did was hang out in the cafe area. Totally lame, man. All that free stuff and you're not going to use it?</p></body></html>

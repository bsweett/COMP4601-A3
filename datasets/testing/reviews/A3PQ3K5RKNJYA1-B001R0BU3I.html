<meta name="summary" content="Great acting by Cheadle and Pearce - SPOILER ALERT!"></head><body><p>Excellent script, direction, acting and storyline. Don Cheadle as Samir Horn, the "bomb-maker" of a secret terrorist organization is convincing as the "deep cover operative" and Guy Pearce as the relentless FBI agent Roy Clayton on his trail. The last few tension-filled minutes are worth it; and amply demonstrates that superior direction and editing can result in an excellent movie. Great support from Said Taghmaoui as Omar, Samir's "brother-in-arms."<br /><br />The last couple of minutes got me really tense as I thought Don Cheadle (Samir) was going to get blown away by the "other guards" on the boat (what happened to them when the good guys boarded the ship?).<br />Anyway, I figured Samir had somehow sabotaged the simultaneous bombings by wiring the explosives incorrectly on all the bombers. Then I saw that they all seemed to have boarded only one type of bus line. Sure, it could've been a nationwide bus service, so I figured he'd set them all to blow up together. Didn't realize that one was enough to take out the entire "crew." Too bad that hapless bus driver had to be sacrificed.</p></body></html>

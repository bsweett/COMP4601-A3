It's transparency can make getting the message across more effective because it is letting you in on what its up to, sort of like in-your-face, wink-wink-nudge-nudge "we know You know" blatant product placement. I suppose. Anyway what I want to say is the movie is simply not that funny, period. No the politics are not what ruined "Machete", for me anyway, so much as the way the politics were delivered. My Mexican-American friends didn't like the movie. Because it isn't very funny. Are we learning how Mexicans are persecuted and about corrupt, opportunistic politicians and white racism, etc., or are we doing a comedy inspired by grindhouse and blaxploitation flicks (which means some socio-political commentary)?<br />You can serve-up the laughs along with some soical awareness. Just look at a recent homage to blaxploitation called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BWP3W0">Black Dynamite</a> to get the right idea. Dig it. And how about just more Machete killing and killing again and Desperado style fights. Brutal action, almost non-stop. But I loved "Once Upon A Time in Mexico" and "Planet Terror"... one BIG difference - these movies had more entertaining characters, no? Having Johnny Depp, Salma Hayek, Willem Dafoe, Enrique Iglesias, Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes and Rub&eacute;n Blades in your picture helps a lot. Robert De Niro looks half asleep to me through many performances these days and he ain't funny. Lindsay Lohan...whatever. OK, Steven Seagal is funny and could have had a fatter role to play.<br /><br />Look, the Machete preview was *art* as far as I'm concerned and Danny Trejo is still the man.</p></body></html>

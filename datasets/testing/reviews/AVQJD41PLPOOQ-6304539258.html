We're talking about the original version of STAR WARS as it was realeased on video "one last time" in 1995.  Black and blue box with Darth Vader on the cover.<br /><br />While the special edition in 1997 was entertaining, it was in no way an improvement for STAR WARS purists, like myself.  The video I'm describing is the original 1977 film before George Lucas started butchering it and it has the benefit of being remastered in THX.<br /><br />I'm not saying don't own the special edition DVD.  Of course own it!  It looks and sounds perfect!  I'm saying own BOTH!<br /><br />By the way, everything I've said I also holds true for the 1995 video release of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, as well.  Between the original film and the 2004 DVD release, this film got butchered the most.  The insertion of Ian McDermid into the scene between Darth Vader and the Emperor was beyond shameful!<br /><br />I can only hope Lucas will one day get the message from his fans and release the original (3) films on DVD.</p></body></html>

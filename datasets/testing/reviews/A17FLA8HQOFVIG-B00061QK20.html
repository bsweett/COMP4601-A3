<meta name="summary" content="Complexity of ideas as well as an epic extravaganza"></head><body><p>This 2002 Chinese movie is an epic extravaganza in the best action film tradition.  It is much more than that, however, as it was conceived with a bigger purpose in mind.  It is not just about the swordplay.  It is about just what it takes to be a hero.  There are themes of love, vengeance and redemption as well as personal dramas inside of all the action.  This is the most expensive Chinese film ever made and I understand the Chinese army itself is cast as the extras.  It was filmed in a remote area of China where it was very windy.  And the scenes all reflect this.  For example there is one action scene with two women engaged in swordplay where golden leaves are blowing all around.<br /><br />The plot seems simple at first.  A swordsman is being honored for conquering a king's enemies.  But as the story unfolds, it is much more complicated than that and we see the same story told over again from several different points of view.  Each time our understanding of it deepens.  And although it is not realistic and could never quite happen this way (especially the choreographed action scenes) the theme is universal even though the plot is a little hard to follow.<br /><br />I have nothing but accolades for the people who brought this to America.  I understand that Quentin Tarantino was involved in this project.  He's seen in one of the extras on the DVD in an interview with the star, Jet Li.  There's also an excellent extra about the director, Zhang Yimou, which really enhanced my appreciation of the film I had just viewed and kept me up long after my bedtime just to relish every moment of it.<br /><br />I loved this film and give it a high recommendation.  It might not be for everybody.  But those who appreciate the art of filmmaking and the complexity of ideas will love it.</p></body></html>

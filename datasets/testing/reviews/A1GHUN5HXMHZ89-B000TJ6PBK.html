John Cusack turns in a great performance as a author that is in search of haunted places. The movie focuses on what happens in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. Now although you will see some gruesome images, you won't see the typical "Saw sequels" and "Hostel" type gore. I enjoyed this movie for that reason because I have always enjoyed movies that set the proper atmosphere, actually much like the first "Saw", and don't spend all their time trying to be gorier than previous movies. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "The Shining", "Secret Window", and "Lost Room". - C. Luster</p></body></html>

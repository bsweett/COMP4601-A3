<meta name="summary" content="Keeping The Saw-ries Alive"></head><body><p>This film helps to make the story of Jigsaw even more complex.  A great addition to the franchise.  Nothing is ever simple in the Saw series and this installment is no exception.  Horror fans should be pleased.  These films seem to be very "fluid" in continuity, film style and feel.  Many other filmmakers could learn from that alone.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

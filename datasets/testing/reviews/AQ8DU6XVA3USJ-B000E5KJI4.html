<meta name="summary" content="A Timeless Epic of Great Heroism and Beauty"></head><body><p>"Troy" doesn't pretend to be an accurate depiction of the Homeric epic poem but states in its credits that it is merely "inspired by" "The Iliad." That kept in mind, this massive film has spectacle and beauty, and the feel and often the look of the great sword and sandal epics of the 1950s. Filmed in Mexico and Malta, the cinematography is a feast for the eyes, and there is wonderful detail in some of the lavish costuming and art direction. The romantic aspects of the story have been thankfully minimized, and the film focuses on the courage and heroism, as well as the lust for power and carnage of war.<br /><br />There are many excellent performances throughout, and I especially enjoy Eric Bana as Hector, and Sean Bean as Odysseus. Orlando Bloom is good as Paris, as are Peter O'Toole as Priam, Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus, Brian Cox as Agamemnon, Rose Byrne as Briseis, Vincent Regan as Eudorus, and a short but lovely appearance by Julie Christie as Achilles' mother, Thetis. Brad Pitt looks like a golden god and is believable as the larger than life Achilles, and is fantastic in the fight scenes. The brilliantly choreographed battle between Achilles and Hector is memorable, and has to be one of the best mano a mano action sequences in film history.<br /><br />Some of the loveliest music written today is for film, and James Horner has outdone himself in "Troy," with the gorgeous song "Remember Me," sung by Josh Groban, and the atmospheric voices of Tanja Tzarovska and Desislava Stefanova woven throughout the score. Wolfgang Peterson's sweeping direction, the cinematography of Paul Bond and Roger Pratt, and the script by David Benioff make this satisfying, and often riveting viewing, and it's a film that should be seen multiple times to fully appreciate. Total running time is 163 minutes.</p></body></html>

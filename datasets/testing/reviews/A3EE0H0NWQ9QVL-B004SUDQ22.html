<meta name="summary" content="Another 'Beautiful Mind'"></head><body><p>Beautiful and mysterious '{Proof}' takes the lives of two math geniuses, a professor at the University of Chicago, Robert (Anthony Hopkins), and his aspiring student daughter, Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Both are gifted and both suffer from mental illness.  Ingeniously, we see the movie from inside Catherine's fragmented consciousness.  Her perception of scrambled time with memories that are elusive makes us passengers inside her struggling mind.  She is his caretaker, but she assumes the independence (and talent) to go to Northwestern and materialize her education.  In the meantime, her father has died, which shatters all the time frames.  Sister Claire (Hope Davis) comes from New York to the funeral.  We find her an irritating presence, but she is intriguing.  Is she thoughtful to Catherine or not?  Everything from shampoo conditioner to funeral arrangements is taxing for Catherine--and it shows. She finds some needed love and reassurance from her father's understudy, Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), and this is where the split comes between audience and protagonist.  Paranoid, she suspects he is some opportunist trying to feed upon her and her father's legacy.  Although even her suspicions are logical.<br /><br />The film posts some important questions for us to ponder.  How crazy was Robert during his lifetime?  How much of a genius?  And, especially how much do these two dynamics fit in for Catherine?  She doesn't know herself.  It is hard for Catherine to sort out the truth from fiction in her scattered consciousness, but she finds out the truth, and so do we.  The way the story is presented is fascinating and emotionally rewarding.  Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning play by David Auburn.  Kudos for director John Madden, who gets us into Catherine's skin, taking advantage of film in a way that the theatre can't.  '{Proof}' is sometimes a beautifully heartbreaking film with revelations that are poignantly presented.<br />(4 1/2*'s)</p></body></html>

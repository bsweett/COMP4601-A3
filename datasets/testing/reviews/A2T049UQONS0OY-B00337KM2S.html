<meta name="summary" content="3.5 stars -- a sequence of cliches but mostly well-done"></head><body><p>George Clooney is one of People magazine's most photographed "older" men, meaning "older" women want to see him which is among the reasons he is sought out for films like this one: a dramedy with a handsome leading actor who thinks he knows himself, finds out life is about more than he thinks it is, tries to reconcile this new knowledge to his new goals, and finds out he's trapped in the life he's made for himself. This is all very nice, of course, and it fooled a lot of critics that haven't seen many movies into believing it was unique to this film even though Frederick March played the role more wisely and with greater commitment in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NZ2OW">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a> more than a half-century ago.<br /><br />Still, there is plenty to like about "Up In the Air," not least of which is Clooney's characterization of a corporate head chopper -- the opposite of what used to be called a headhunter (someone that recruits candidates for open jobs.) In this role, Clooney plays the head chopper -- someone that goes around and tells people they are fired. The script says Clooney does this, "because companies are too chicken s--t to do it themselves."<br /><br />That's disingenuous, of course. My wife was canned by a Fortune 500 corporation directly, not through a head chopper. She was called to personnel at 3 p.m. one day, told her job was eliminated and she was not being offered another in the company, that someone would get her coat, she should leave the building accompanied by company guards, and her personal belongings would be mailed to her.<br /><br />In "Up In the Air," once Clooney delivers the bad news, people were allowed to hang around their office the rest of the day. In real life, people would tear up the place, spew virtriol to their soon-to-be ex-coworkers, and use their computers to download viruses to wreck their company's operating system under such circumstances. But, I recall saying there were things to like about this movie...<br /><br />Those include the film's second subject, Clooney's romance with another head chopper played by  Vera Farmiga (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341QE">The Departed</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OU5NLW">Quid Pro Quo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D9PNS">Love in the Time of Money</a>), who plays his female alter ego. In one scene they compare their travel and hospitality cards, a sad view into their lonely and empty lives spent on the road, in hotels, and in coporate backrooms telling people their careers are either dead, dying, or on life support, but a scene that seems on the surface to be one of happiness and fulfillment.<br /><br />The pair have an affair, of course, and, in a later incomprehensibly dumb sequence at Clooney's sister's wedding -- where he takes the object of his affair as a date -- Clooney's life objective suddenly turns 180 degrees. He then bolts, revolts, tries to relent, and calls on Farmiga to be his soulmate. This episode is full of heartbreak and predictability, but so is much of the movie.<br /><br />The main attraction of "Up In the Air" is the starry and beautiful leads, the breezy script that moves quickly from scene to scene, and the scenes where Clooney and Farmiga interact. Take away these elements and you have a fairly bland film about some aspects of corporate life in the post-2008 stock, auto, financial and employment markets' meltdown and its affect on the employees of those industries.<br /><br />Just as Michael Douglas played the angry American who lost his job in the 1991-92 recession in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790742780">Falling Down</a>, George Clooney here represents the decaying infrastructure of America's coporations in the post-meltdown era. The fact that there's a love story and some beautiful people in this flick, and a fast script, is what keeps you from thinking about the reality of the situation. If you want to do that, watch Michael Moore's comedy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030Y11XS">Capitalism: A Love Story</a>.</p></body></html>

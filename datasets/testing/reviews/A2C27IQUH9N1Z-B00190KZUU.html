<meta name="summary" content="tall tales wrapped around a father-son relationship film"></head><body><p>Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands) is the perfect director for this film about a dying father (Albert Finney) and his son (Billy Crudup), alienated by the father's habit of grabbing the limelight with his elaborate tall tales.  The film is a bit confusing, with multiple actors playing characters as the timeline jumps back and forth, but the fantasy sequences show Burton at his best and the cast, including Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, Jessica Lange and Steve Buscemi, is flawless.  The film uses elaborate folk stories about circuses, giants and warfare to address the relationship between fathers and sons, and is thus a film that will be entertaining for children even as it touches men in a more personal way.<p>The dvd extras are very good and include a commentary track by director Tim Burton; a trivia game about Burton's previous films; and many fine featurettes concerning several of the characters, Burton, myth, special effects, and the book on which the film is based.</p></body></html>

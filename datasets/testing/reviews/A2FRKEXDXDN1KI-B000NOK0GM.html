Winning the 1949 Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, the film would win a British Academy Award for Best Film and an Academy Award for "Best Black and White Cinematography".<br /><br />Directed by Carol Reed (The Running Man", "Oliver!", "Follow Me"), "The Third Man" is an adaptation of a novela by Graham Greene ("The Quiet American", "Double Take", "Strike It Rich")  who also penned the original screenplay.  The film would feature music by Anton Karas and cinematography by Robert Krasker ("The Criminal", "Cry Wolf" and "The Quiet American").<br /><br />But the film would also receive top honors with the film being selected by the British French Institute as the best British Film of the 20th Century, 57th on the American Film Institute's list of top American films and  is regard by cinema fans as one of the great films made of all time.<br /><br />Although released on DVD from THE CRITERION COLLECTION in the past, the film has now underwent through modern restoration and was released on Blu-ray in Dec. 2008.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"The Third Man" is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  According to Criterion, "The picture has been slightly windowboxed to ensure that the maximum image is visible on all monitors.  On widescreen televisions, black bars will appear on the left and right of the image to maintain the proper screen format.  This high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a restored 35 mm time-grain master positive."<br /><br />As with most Criterion Blu-ray releases, the company also had thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.<br /><br />The picture quality, although in black and white, looks incredible for a film created in 1949.  Black are nice and deep but you can see a lot more detail in the surroundings.<br /><br />Suffice to say, THE CRITERION COLLECTION releases films with how the director intended the film to be.  There is no DNR (digital noise reduction) and no softness and the film keeps the grain and retains its film-like quality.  The film just looks beautiful on Blu-ray!  I didn't own the previous Criterion release on DVD, fans of the film have commented that this Blu-ray release features the definitive picture quality for the "The Third Man".<br /><br />Although Robert Krasker's cinematography was criticized at the time for using an tilted/angled view, fans have shown their appreciation for Krasker's artistic style.  I personally enjoyed the cinematography of the film.<br /><br />As for audio, the soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from a 35mm optical soundtrack and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The audio has an uncompressed monaural soundtrack.  My Onkyo receiver received a multichannel signal (via bitstream) but overall, audio dialogue is understandable and clear.  And Anton Karas's music sounds absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Subtitles are featured in English.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"The Third Man" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio commentary by filmmaker Steve Soderbergh and screenwriter Tony Gilroy - A commentary that is quite complimentary of the film and also discussing about the film and some factual tidbits.<br />  * Audio commentary by film scholar Dana Polan - An informative and entertaining commentary by the film scholar Dana Polan.

For one, the talents were well-cast, the cinematography and the amount of cuts and smooth editing was fantastic, the music was memorable and most of all the storyline was well-planned.<br /><br />Because the film took place right after World War II, the destruction of Vienna and what was going on at the time with people having to sell their jewelry and belongings just to get bread and butter due to the heavy rationing at the time is captured.  The penicillin stolen from American medical areas and were meant to take care of the wounded and sick but being sold in the black market and that story of racketeering is captured in the film.  Also, how Vienna was separated into four zones is integrated into the storyline of the film through the various shots of key locations was well-planned.<br /><br />So, in some sense, this film is also a snapshot of a time in history and why it remains so popular in the minds of many cinema fans but also a sign of pain for some who live in Austria and seeing how things were at the time the film was being shot.  Even many historians on Vienna's history are impressed of how much the film captures that difficult time in Vienna history and also has actual footage from that time.<br /><br />But there are just so many memorable scenes that stick in my head.  From the music (which was #1 in the charts and started a zither craze) to certain shots where shadows were effectively used, Vienna was well integrated into the film and who can forget the child screaming after his father is killed and trying to place the blame on the wrong person.  Or even the final shot of the film.  There are so many moments in this film that stay strong in your head.<br /><br />But what I found so fantastic about this release from THE CRITERION COLLECTION was the amount of bonus content.  It's one thing to get audio commentaries but two documentaries, radio shows and many more.  That's awesome to receive so much content for an older film such as "The Third Man".  Bonus content that actually is quite entertaining, especially when you find out how volatile things were behind-the-scenes.  Surprising to say the least.<br /><br />Overall, "The Third Man" is a film and a Blu-ray release worth having in your HD collection.  It's also important to note that because THE CRITERION COLLECTION has recently lost the rights to this film, if you want to own the definitive version of this film, you better get it now before the prices skyrocket for the Blu-ray or DVD release.<br /><br />"The Third Man - THE CRITERION COLLECTION" is highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A modern crime classic"></head><body><p>First off--personally, I'd give this film five stars, but I'm rating the DVD, and it does not justice to fans .<p>This is just not your typical 'cop' film by a long shot.  Michael Mann has been aiming for this his whole career.  His Thief (1981) has similar elements, even similar scenes.  Heat is actually a remake of Mann's own LA Takedown, a 1989 TV film.  <p>With Heat, every element is in place.  The cast is a dream, even for a Hollywood film.  DeNiro and Pacino do some of their best work and even the ground in the story of a dedicated cop tracking the leader of a band of professional thieves.  The surrounding players are all pro: Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Jon Voight.  The film has the perfect look, a cold, steely blue light and a much different look at LA than in any film.  The soundtrack is in place as well, a mix of Eliot Goldenthal's rich score, Lisa Gerrard, Brian Eno, and Kronos Quartet.<p>At three hours, Mann throws in everything.  The director's reverence for the material pushes the film way past genre.  It's unfair to call Heat a 'heist' film or even a 'crime' film.  It's a rich drama about relationships between cops and crooks and men and women.<p>The action is spectacular, everyone remembers the shootout scene in downtown LA.  It highlights an awesome sound mix.  Though it's extreme, it wasn't two years before a two man crew pulled off a bank heist and started a massive shootout with cops in North Hollywood.  <p>The DVD sucks.  For a film like this, a three hour epic from a big name director, with these stars, we get zilch.  Three theatrical trailers, and French subtitles.  There's a Dolby 5.1 mix, and the film is in widescreen with a nice, clean picture.  I'm guessing Mann had little say in the release; this is doubtless a film that should get a commentary track and some behind the scenes material.<p>However, for now it's recommended on the strength of an excellent American crime film.</p></body></html>

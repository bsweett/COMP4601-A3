<meta name="summary" content="The best &quot;Star Trek&quot; film"></head><body><p>The &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies were all originally released on DVD with only the bare-minimum treatment- the &quot;special features&quot; were theatrical trailers and widescreen options.  This upset me, especially since the second &quot;Star Trek&quot; film- &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;- is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Finally in late 2002, &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; was given the treatment it deserved, and was fully loaded with special features.  These further enhanced a film that actually didn't need them too much anyways, because it was so good.<p>&quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; is my favorite &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, and is arguably the best film that the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise could ever be expected to deliver.  It isn't a perfect film, but I still give it five stars because of how enjoyable it is.  William Shatner- whose acting has never exactly been heralded- gives his best performance here, showing the right amount of leadership, arrogance, and tenderness.  I won't say much about Ricardo Montalban's performace, since it can just be summed up as the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; villain ever.  He hams it up like there's no tomorrow, and he's terrific to watch every step of the way.  The returning &quot;Star Trek&quot; regulars all fit into their roles comfortably.  Director Nicholas Meyer injected some much needed life into the series with this entry, as he added the right amount of humor, action, and emotional bonding.  The ending when a major character dies is surprisingly wrenching, even over 20 years later.  The only part where the film missteps is with Merritt Butrick's performance as David- he's really not very good (he would improve in the next entry).  Other than that, this is one &quot;Star Trek&quot; film that will appeal to all sci-fi fans, not just Trekkies.<p>Ironically, this was easily the cheapest &quot;Star Trek&quot; film made, even when adjusted for inflation.  The special effects do look somewhat dated now, and some people may object to the film's occasionally hokey tone.  However, I think that this is simply a wonderful viewing experience, and was the peak of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.  If you want to see just how the &quot;Star Trek&quot; magic works on its fans, look no further than &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;.</p></body></html>

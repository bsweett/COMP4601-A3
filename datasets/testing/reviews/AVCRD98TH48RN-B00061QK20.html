This film is huge in scope with magnificent sets, a large cast of extras all clad in ancient armor, and beautiful locales for all the scenes to unfold shrouded in a veil of fantastic cinematography.  I was reminded of two Kurosawa films, in particular: "Ran" and "Rashomon."  "Ran" because of the sheer size of this film with regards to sets, cast, and costumes; and "Rashomon" because of the unusual plotting.  It isn't until the film is nearing its conclusion that the entire truth is revealed with an historical aspect thrown in for good measure.  Of course, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is the most immediate comparison in modern day cinema with regards to the balletic choreography during the many fight sequences.  The magical fantasy that was so charming in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is given a much more serious tone here with ancient history/folklore as the driving spiritual force behind the story.  There are some minor flaws.  The one that stands out the most is when two similar scenes are compared.  Both are fight sequences that take place within the matched warriors' minds.  The early sequence is shot in black and white, while the later scene is shot in color.  That sort of lack of consistency is the main reason I cannot consider this a masterpiece.  There were many other small, though unfortunately noticable flaws scattered throughout the story, but to nitpick would be to forget how good the rest of the film is.  The cinematography is the true star here, though many of the actors acquit themselves with talent and dignity.  This is a glorious and colorful spectacle from one of my favorite directors, Zhang Yimou.  It was interesting that he chose to do an action film when his most notable films are all dramas.  Some of his finest works include "Raise the Red Lantern," "Ju Dou," and my personal favorite, "To Live."  As for the DVD, the special features section highlights include a comprehensive documentary featurette and a sit-in with Quentin Tarantino and Jet Li talking about the film and other martial arts films of note.  All in all, this DVD is a solid purchase.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

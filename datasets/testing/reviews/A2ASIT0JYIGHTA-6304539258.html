<meta name="summary" content="Thanks to everyone on here"></head><body><p>I bought this DVD because I wanted the 1977 film. However, I didn't check the back cover details properly (ie. 4:3 letterbox, yuck!). Fortunately, I read the Amazon site before removing the shrink-wrap. Thank you to all the reviewers who have warned about this DVD. I then marched back to the shop with my unopened DVD and got my money back. Thanks again to you all.<br /><br />I will not put up with non-anamorphic DVD's in this day and age. Nor will I put up with a greedy old fart called Lucas who fiddles with film history. It reminds me of when Spielberg stuffed around with E.T. in 2002. The CGI effects he introduced then were dreadful and made E.T. look comical.<br /><br />I am willing to bet that Star Wars (original version) will eventually be re-released correctly either in time for christmas 2007 or when the HD-DVD or Blue Ray format is settled.<br /><br />Thanks again to all you reviewers. You all deserve five stars, while this product only gets one star. The best part is, Lucas didn't get my money in the end!!!</p></body></html>

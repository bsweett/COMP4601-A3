<meta name="summary" content="Consummate Guy Flick"></head><body><p>This is a great Guy Film, to watch alone or with a buddy and, preferably, with a giant pizza and a few glasses of beer.  It features a terrific dialogue-driven plot, a few enjoyable action scenes, and some great background music.  It's a dude movie all the way.<p>Don't EVEN try to watch it with your wife or girlfriend.  She won't like it, and there is no way you can persuade her to understand how good it is.  Don't even make the effort.  This is simply the reality of the situation... and, it's her loss.  C'est la vie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't Listen to Rodger Ebert!"></head><body><p>Rodger Ebert was wrong..if you read his review he didn't believe this was a film was impressive.  It may not be a critical success. However it does capture the characters. Especially the Thing.  He was my favorite! Without him the movie would'nt have worked. His character was pivotal and was the turning point of the movie.<br /><br />Although the director took some creative licence to change Dr. Doom, it was a crowd pleaser.  The kids and parents in the audience were cheering the Thing and the group as they were battling with Dr. Doom.<br /><br />I have to say that a lot of the bad press this movie has on the web is wrong.  It's not a dark Batman type of super hero movie! It's one of those films that you can take your family to without having to do a lot of explaining to your children.  I only hope that the sequel can be made with the Silver Surfer and Galactus.<br /><br />...if done right...the Surfer and Galactus would be a landmark film with acting and CGI.  Let's hope for FF 2!</p></body></html>

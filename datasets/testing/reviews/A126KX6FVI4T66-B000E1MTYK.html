Rowling seem to be turning these sequels out at record rate.<br />Magic is fun for kids?<br />From the UFO stuff in the 60' through 80's I realize that what seems "harmless" fun<br />to the more intelligent can be a trap for the less preceptive<br />and simple?<br />Sure, I like these movies and seeing the characters grow up<br />on the screen, but the problems of this being a sort of modern Buck Rogers<br />serial of full length movies is one that we will have to deal with down the road.<br />I just saw the last one out on dvd over Christmas<br />and the villain's personality is split into 7 parts:<br />each of which it seems will be killed in froth coming books and movies.<br />That plot device will keep this going past 2017 and make Rowling<br />as rich as the Beatles?</p></body></html>

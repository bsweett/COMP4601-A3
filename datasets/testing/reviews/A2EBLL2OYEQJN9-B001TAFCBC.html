<meta name="summary" content="A romantic comedy and a mystery"></head><body><p>This is an examination of a relationship--the highs and the lows, the good memories you'd give anything to keep, the on-going nagging issues, the misunderstandings.  In addition to being a romance, Eternal Sunshine is also a mystery, because Carrey needs to figure out who was behind his girlfriend Clementine's memory erasure, and he needs to figure out how to survive on his own.<br /><br />The movie is a lot easier to follow than the previews let on.  The portrayal of Carrey's inner memory map, and how memories converge into one another, was beautiful.  The filmmakers are to be admired for capturing the concept so well on screen.  Pick this one up if you want a nice break from the usual romantic comedy fare.</p></body></html>

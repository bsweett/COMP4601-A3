<meta name="summary" content="Great stuff from Michael Mann; Foxx deserves Oscar nod"></head><body><p>'Collateral' is classic Michael Mann - it resembles 'Heat' in a lot of ways.  Mann spends time on character development.  We get to know Janie Foxx's character 'Max' very well through about a 15-minute or so introduction.  It's great movie making.<br /><br />By contrast, Tom Cruise's 'Vincent' is a cipher here.  And rightfully so.  Mann's unwillingness - and Foxx's inability - to penetrate Vincent is crucial to the chill that develops whenever Vincent swings into action.  Cruise is great - never once did I think "that's Tom Cruise playing Vincent." Instead, the guy frightened me to death.  So much for the theory that Tom Cruise has to play the hero.  He's about as far from that here as you can get.<br /><br />Foxx surpasses even that praise.  He's deserves an Academy Award nomination here.  His 10-minute scene with Javier Bardem is just about the finest piece of acting you'll ever see.  This one-on-one confrontation was reminiscent of the Pacino/DeNiro ("I do scores") meet in 'Heat.'</p></body></html>

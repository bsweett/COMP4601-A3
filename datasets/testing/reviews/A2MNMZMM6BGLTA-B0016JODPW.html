<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>I found this movie to be very disappointing. I thought at one time that Phillip Seymore Hoffman could not make a bad movie or have a bad performance. This movie just did nothing for me and I found it boring as hell. Ethan Hawke has not grown as all as an actor and I think he is pretty poor. Marisa Tomei was naked in the movie, that is the best I can say for it and I find her to be a poor actress as well. How she ever won and Academy Award is beyond me but hey, they gave one to Cuba Gooding too so that says alot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stupid"></head><body><p>I have seen my share of dumb, stupid, pointless obsene comedies, but this one certainly tops that list, or close to it. I found absolutely nothing funny about this film. Was it original, yea, sure, but that doesn't make it good. I mean, it was barely watchable. I applaud Sasha for attempting to play a role like this, and for staying in character, but really, this is a pretty awful movie. And worst of all is, I bet there are quite a few ignorant people out there that would think that how they portray Kazakstan in the film, is how it really is, which I must say, it is certainly not. I know how to take a joke every now and then, when it truly is funny, but this is a complete waste of time. Yes, it is interesting to note that there are quite a few clueless and dumb people in this country who would do or say anything if they got a chance to be in a 'movie' but it really isn't surprising. And then you get the people threatening to sue just cause they didn't think it would be seen here in America. Give me a break.</p></body></html>

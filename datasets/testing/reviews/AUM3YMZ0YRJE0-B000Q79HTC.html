<meta name="summary" content="gritty realism makes this something unique and new"></head><body><p>This has got to be one of the best action films I have ever seen.  Not only does Matt Damon with his superb acting make you believe in the reality of what happens onscreen, but the story is complex and darkly fun.<br /><br />I think what distinguishes this series is how realistic Damon makes it seem.  THere are no techie fixes or superhuman feats, just disciplined improvisation by the ultimate assasin.  Then there is his personal crisis, worked out in amnesia and his desire to start a new life, perhaps with a woman that he is endangering.  Finally, there are the shenanigans of the CIA, with its covert program gone awry and the brutal power maneuvers of the flacks trying to save the situation and their careers.  Very fun and interesting, with a nice space for the viewer's imagination to take hold.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Tribute to Ray Charles falls short"></head><body><p>Ray Charles was a very talented man, theres no getting around that.  Jamie Foxx is a very talented man, theres no getting around that one either...but this movie was just not as good as it should have and could have been.  A bi-opic is tricky, you either have it or you don't.  There are many great ones (A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man & Finding Neverland) and then there are ones that fall short of the mark like 'Ray'.  It's not an understatment to say that Foxx's performance SAVED this movie from becoming critic foder, and there are MANY critics who agree, this movie is really nothing without it's star performer.  Ray's life is intriging all in its own, but Taylor Hackford does a terrible job of piecing it together.  It was choppy and felt out of place, like scenes were thrown together last minute without really thinking about where they should go...(Remember Alexander anyone?)  Kerry Washington does a good job as the supporting wife (we've had an outstanding amount of supporting ladies lately) and I feel she too deserved the oscar nod for supporting actress and was yet robbed.  Really, Ray Charles was not much of a role model.  It's commendable that he overcame his vices (namely drugs and sex) but that is where I felt the movie went wrong.  There was too much focus on secondary things throughout the film that when we get to the end we've exhasted all our time and have no time left to really show us how Ray overcame his obsticles.  We see Ray in a hospital bed trying to recover and we see him go through his withdrawls but it's so quick and before you know it, he's healed.  What I loved about movies like 'A Beautiful Mind' was that it showed how his problems effected those around him BUT it also showed us how he fought to overcome them, and how he succeded.  Ray shows us how he wasted everything and everyone he ever loved and then it just tells us that he overcame his problems by showing us newspaper clippings and such.  Poor choice on Hackfords part.  I give this movie a 3 1/2 stars because Foxx did outstanding.  I just feel bad that with all it's potential it fizzled come the conclution instead of going out with a bang like say 'Cinderella Man' was able to do.</p></body></html>

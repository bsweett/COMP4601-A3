I thought it was too dark and was missing much of the "soul" of the Star Trek TNG series, which excelled at morality plays. However, in re-watching it recently, I've revised my opinion upwards, albeit it still doesn't rank as the greatest of the Star Trek films.<br /><br />First, the bad. While the movie seems to contain an interesting moral message about the "nature vs. nurture" debate, it sacrifices that subplot on the alter of action scenes. The idea of Data and Picard confronting "clones" of themselves is intriguing, but the plot device bringing them together seems forced. In fact, the whole chase scene at the beginning seems gratuitous and out-of-place for a Star Trek film.<br /><br />The second major problem with the movie is that director Stuart Baird seems unfamiliar with the ensemble nature of Star Trek TNG. After the initial scene, the movie becomes a "Data and Picard" show. The other characters only have minor roles. Geordi, Dr. Crusher, and Worf have little more than glorified cameos. While everybody loves Data and Picard, they work best when they can work with the other crew members. Admittedly, Deanna Troi gets to put her telepathy to good use, but her scenes, including a telepathic "rape," almost seem more awkward than exciting.<br /><br />Finally, the Remans and the Reman plot were simply not well executed. The Romulans would have been a perfectly good enemy for the TNG crew. They've always been manipulative and intelligent. By contrast, the Remans seem like a bunch of boorish brutes. They don't seem to plan any of the attacks or do much thinking at all, leaving that up to the human leader Shinzon. And the masks just don't look realistic. They look like Romulans wearing vampire masks. Their uniforms are shiny almost to the point of looking like disco suits. I suspect the producer and director thought the movie needed a more "menacing" enemy, but I think the Romulans would have worked better.<br /><br />Having said all of that, the movie does work as an action movie, if not the most faithful of Star Trek films. It's entertaining and suspenseful. The threat to Earth is serious and Picard's response to it is appropriately grave. The space battles look beautiful, especially with the green nebula as a backdrop. The damage the Enterprise E suffers in the battle is shocking, even more so than the destruction of the Enterprise D in Star Trek: Generations. Seeing the enterprise in such disrepair really raises the emotional stakes.<br /><br />Despite my earlier comments about the plot, this movie does have some wonderful "Star Trek" moments. I was ecstatic when I saw Riker and Troi's wedding - a moment anticipated since the very first TNG episode. The dialogue between Data and Picard about "nature vs. nurture" recalls the best of the TNG series. Picard's reaction to Shinzon's appearance and death are silent yet laden with thought. And, of course, the death of a beloved crew member at the end nearly made me cry.<br /><br />While I wish I could unreservedly praise Star Trek: Nemesis, given that it is the last of the TNG films, my reactions are mixed. There's a lot of unrealized potential and far too many poor choices. Overall, I'd give the movie 3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

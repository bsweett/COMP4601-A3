<meta name="summary" content="Hostel  (2005)"></head><body><p>Director:  Eli Roth<br /><br />Cast:  Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eythor Gudjonsson, Barbara Nedeljakova, Jan Vlasak, Jana Kaderabkova, Jennifer Lim.<br /><br />Running Time: 94 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for intense, gruesome torture violence, extreme amounts of female nudity, and language.<br /><br />"Hostel" is a very confused, problematic film. On the one hand, it is armed with a dynamite, socially relevant premise and an absolutely blistering albeit accidental commentary of the human condition, judged especially on the audience but, on the other, it is an appalling example of missed execution, bumbling screen writing, and over-hype. It is a dichotomy of contradiction that unravels the macabre with the simple relish of fraternity caliber humor. Rest assured, this is not a very good film, but perhaps there is enough novelty in what will no doubt be a hugely successful film to warrant a look at some point.  The premise and subtext underlying director Eli Roth's ("Cabin Fever") latest film is essentially a dissection of the pleasures that drive two separate groups of vacationers. First, there are the three backpackers traveling as sex tourists across the European continent in pursuit of the carnal pleasures of the flesh. Two of the kids are the typical college byproduct of an over-sexualized culture in which adolescent achievement is measured more by the number of orgasm achieved during the month long jaunt rather than any academic, professional, or personal merit. Complementing this group are the heavies: rich, professional men who for a sizable fee can satisfy their diabolical pleasures of the body through the murder an torture of specimens apportioned out by some clandestine charnal company of mobsters and henchmen. These two groups are two extreme sides of the same coin, both in search of the pleasures derived from other people; one sexual, one absolutely homicidal. A very thin thread divides the two groups of protagonists, perhaps leading credence to the theory that left unchecked, extreme sexual behavior can lead to extreme homicidal behavior.<br /><br />"Hostel" then breaks down in its transition. It turns alternately from a light hearted, "EuroTrip" sex romp populated by one truly annoying Icelandic character to a somewhat dark, more like dimly lighted than opaque, journey into the world of economic sadism but the transition is full of seams. With little of the ominousness of the gruesomely brilliant "Wolf Creek" or the suspense of "Audition", the plot heavy handedly limps from "American Pie" to Hannibal Lector like a jagged scar. Before the audience even has a chance to grasp the nature of the threat, one character is offed off-screen and another has a sit down with the diabolical surgeon who explains pretty much the jist of what is going on.  Also, there was a lack of continuity with the heavies; since the baddies are rich merchants of torture and leather jacketed henchmen, the nature of the villainy lacked a face. Black jackets and walkie talkies don't generate the same suspense as a ghostly Micheal Myers or backwoods mutant. In fact, as two of the principals flee the dungeons, the film digresses into an absurd Inspector Gadget esquire escape, with legions of henchmen pacing back and forth oblivious to the cowering pair skulking their way through the corridors Roth lacks an eye for action as evident here. It was beyond heavy handed, it was contrived.<br /><br />The torture was rather boring, nothing much new: slicing of an Achilles, a dissection, a drill to the foot, clipping of a toe.  It was all pretty pedestrian and attention seeking as personified y its director. The carnage in this film essentially plays out with the suspense of a college party drinking game.  In the end, Roth may have betrayed his own sensibility. Changing tone for the third time in the film, the survivors limp toward a showdown with their tormentors in which retribution is inflicted in such a light hearted manner that one has to wonder if Roth even believes in the subtext of his own film. If sex and sadism are two extreme sides of the same coin, then how can he relishly delight in the slaughter of the heavies with such gratuitously bloody style The audience swooned when the breasts made their first appearance, reviled (mildly) when the torture commenced, and then laughed when the three Hostel wranglers were rundown on the street Is Roth suggesting that the same psycho sexual tenancies exist even in relatively sane people (the audience?) or perhaps was the gore thrown in for the pure geek factor? If it is the former than the joke is on the audience and Roth is laughing at his own fan base. Either way, the change in tempo tended to unravel any horror that could have been generated, by purpose or incident. In the end, the carnage of "Hostel" is tantamount to eating a bad Thai meal; heavy feet and buyer's remorse.</p></body></html>

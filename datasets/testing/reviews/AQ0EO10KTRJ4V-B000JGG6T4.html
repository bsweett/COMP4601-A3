<meta name="summary" content="OK......... not as good as expected"></head><body><p>Basically MAN ON FIRE was pretty good.<br /><br />Not quite what I expected from previews (pacing was a bit flat).... but much better than alot of garbage released these days.<br /><br />My biggest complaint ?<br /><br />This film had some of the worst cinematography, lighting, camera angles and editing of any film I have seen this side of low budget camcorder-shot B-films.<br /><br />The camera work, visuals and lighting made the film a bit annoying to watch and detracted from the film's overall impact.</p></body></html>

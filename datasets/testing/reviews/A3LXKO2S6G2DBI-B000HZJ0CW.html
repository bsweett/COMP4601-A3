<meta name="summary" content="A Mediocre Entry into the Star Trek Film Series"></head><body><p>Though I feel a bit out of place reviewing a &quot;Next Generation&quot; Star Trek Film--I was never a huge fan of the second Star Trek TV series or any that came after it--there's enough wrong with this particular entry to deserve comment.  Even on the small screen, ho-hum Jean-Luc Picard and crew were tedious substitutes for the original series' wonderfully adventurous and colorful characters, and it's that lack of charisma that is the main problem with &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis.&quot;  Without caring much about the characters, there's no emotional punch to the film's often poorly conceived and executed scenes, even if some seem lifted from the much less expensive but much more watchable predecessor, &quot;Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan.&quot;  In this one, several rather awkward plot contrivances pit a heretofore unknown clone of Picard named Shinzon against the Federation, though the reasons for the clone's psychotic hatred against humanity are murky, at best.  (From what we see onscreen, it makes more sense for him to hate his Romulan keepers.)  While the film's opening ten minutes are gripping--featuring the brutal assassination of the Romulan government--things go downhill from there, including a tired wedding sequence that has little to do with the rest of the film, several space battles created with topnotch special effects but that are as exciting as watching bathtub toys bobbing along, and the inevitable, surprisingly bland face-to-face confrontation between Shinzon and Picard.  The film's pace and story are so unengaging that I even had time to consider how silly it was to use vehicles with wheels in an age of spaceships zipping around (through a ship's corridors, no less) and people beaming themselves from place to place; &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; gave me plenty of time to disengage from what was happening on the screen.  So far, only one &quot;Next Generation&quot; movie has held my interest--the surprisingly fun &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;--but that's probably because it came closest in spirit to the 1960s TV series (though it contradicts what we learned there).  Even Jerry Goldsmith's score can't seem to pump any excitement into what should have been Captain Picard's finest hour.</p></body></html>

He goes for action and he fails at that too. The problem is, this is a director who simply doesn't know how to make a movie. What's the movie about? I'll tell you. There's this super woman, this group of people, a mad scientist and a monster guy and they all run around shooting stuff. There, you don't need to see it now. My favorite scene is when this super sexed up cop enters a room with a little girl and there are zombies in the room and the girl is scared but the cop says not to worry because the zombies are slow and they can just run right around them. HAHAHAHA! That takes any kind of threat out of zombies right there. End the movie now. But no. It drags on through this plot that makes absolutely no sense. Somebody explain to me what the point is of scientists making two monster people and making them battle each other. There's no suspense in this movie, no drama, horrible acting, so-so special effects and no story what so ever.<br /><br />And it's sad because the Resident Evil games are known to be the scariest games out there. So what the heck is up with this movie?</p></body></html>

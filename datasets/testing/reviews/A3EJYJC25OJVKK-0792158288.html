<meta name="summary" content="Three great movies boxed in one!"></head><body><p>This movie trilogy is a threesome pack of three unforgettable action/adventure movies that feature our beloved archaeologist. All three of the movies are tremendous classics all in their own right. Each one of them are unique and different from each other. The outstanding scripts of George Lucas and the incredible directing of Steven Spielberg all combine to create a totally awesome movie trilogy. <p>RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK: This first entry in the movie series is probably the most loved of all the three. This one finds Jones going after a religious artifact called the Ark, while staying at least one step ahead of Nazi explorers and a rival archaeologist associated with them named Belloq, who are also after it. Marion Ravenwood was Jones&#65533; love in this movie. She was funny, and intelligent and sexy in a way because of her strong attitude. For me, I like rebellious women in action/hero movies. The villainous Toht was unforgettable, being played by the late Ronald Leacy who passed away ten years after this movie. Belloq was an awesome villain. They have no idea of what&#65533;s in store for them when they get to the Ark&#65533;s power. This is my favorite movie from 1981. There are some incredibly funny scenes too from time to time. <p>INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM: This second entry in the series is the most controversial of the three but for me, this is probably tied with the first one as my second favorite. This one brings Jones out of Nazi-controlled Germany to the dark underground caverns of a religious cult called the Thuggie Cult lead by Mola Ram. Jones&#65533; love though in this one was Willie Scott, a famous singer from Shanghai, China. Willie in my opinion was relatively irritating with her excessively helpless character but occasionally showed some toughness but overall was nowhere near as good as Marion was. &#65533;Temple Of Doom&#65533; caused controversy with moviegoers saying that it was much more violent and negatively portrayed the Indians as bloodthirsty and hateful and then British come and save the day. To that, I say GARBAGE! European colonists killed numerous tribal populations during the past 500 years in North America (Native Americans, Aztecs), South America(Mayan, Brazilian tribes) and Australia(Aboriginals) so basically every nationality in the world has been the villain and the hero at different times. Don&#65533;t listen to these detractors. About the more violent atmosphere, with movies that are loaded with extremely graphic content, this movie now is pretty much lightweight. Despite all the controversy, this movie was a winning successor to Raiders. The action scenes and funny lines made &#65533;Temple Of Doom&#65533; every bit as entertaining as &#65533;Raiders&#65533; was. Even Willie was funny at times too. <p>INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE: This is by far my favorite of the combo. This movie brings the series full circle back to the Nazi-controlled Germany on two missions: Find his missing father and also to find a religious artifact called the Holy Grail. Jones and his father Henry Jones Sr. now are on a dangerous quest to beat the Nazis and their leader Walter Donavan to the Grail before they get their hands on it and gain immortality but all of them have no idea of the powers that they are coming to grips with and also learn the price of immortality. This time though, the woman love is actually a villainess named Esla Scheider who is also associated with the Nazi&#65533;s. Elsa is my opinion wasn&#65533;t as strong as Marion was but was miles above Willie Scott in my opinion. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford play the best father/son movie duo that I&#65533;ve ever seen and I guess that one is never too old to be a hero. There are also a lot of humorous lines interwoven within the action scenes too. We also see how Indiana got the fedora, whip and the scar. &#65533;The Last Crusade&#65533; brought this dynamite movie trilogy to a top rate conclusion.<p>This is a fantastic movie gift set with three unforgettable classics. There is the possibility of a fourth Indiana Jones movie in the near future. If it does come to fruition, it&#65533;s unlikely that Marcus Brody will be returning as Denholm Elliot who played him is now deceased but most of the rest of the permanent characters will return. Anyhow, this trilogy set is a marvelous purchase as you get all three of the movies all in one box. Now that&#65533;s a hefty purchase!</p></body></html>

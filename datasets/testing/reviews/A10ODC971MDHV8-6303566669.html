<meta name="summary" content="The Terminator"></head><body><p>Long before Arnold had a gubernatorial gleam in his eye, he starred as a hulking, monotone killing machine in this electrifying sci-fi action thriller by "Titanic" director Cameron. Popping off some of the most famous one-liners in film history ("Hasta la vista, baby!"), Schwarzenegger is both frightening and funny, even as he brutally destroys anyone who interferes with his mission. Hamilton and Biehn handle their roles splendidly too, with credible intensity, fear, and against-all-odds resolve. Full of dazzling special effects and far better than its buffed-up sequels, "The Terminator" is a hellish, suspense-fueled fun ride into the future.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="excellent movie with great performances"></head><body><p>A Film by Steven Spielberg<p>Catch Me If You Can is based on the 1980 memoir by Frank Abagnale.  We are told at the very beginning that this movie is inspired by the book, which means that there are changes in both the events of the book as well as the characters.  All this means is that the filmmakers chose to tell a slightly different story than was Abagnale presented in the book.  It doesn't make the movie any less truthful.  <p>This is the story of con man Frank Abagnale, Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio).  The movie starts with Abagnale in a French prison and being released into the custody of FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  Throughout the film we switch back between Abagnale conning and running from the law to Abagnale and Hanratty talking on the plane.  It offers a nice change of pace as well as a continued questioning of how Abagnale got caught.  <p>We flash back to Abagnale before he leaves home.  He is devoted to his father (Christopher Walken), and is deeply hurt by the divorce and the court requirement that he make the choice of which parent he wants to live with.  Instead, Abagnale chooses neither and runs away to New York City.  Thus begins his life of the con (though there is a suggestion that he had been doing some check/credit card conning before he runs away).  Surprisingly, the movie strays from focusing on Frank Abagnale himself but spends just as much (or more) time on Carl Hanratty and the hunt to catch Abagnale.  <p>Hanratty is a somewhat geeky FBI Agent.  He is very serious and very devoted to his job of catching check frauds like Abagnale.  He is good at his job, but Abagnale leads Hanratty on a long chase over most of the country (and the world) before ending in France.  The film shows as Hanratty discovers more clues as to where Abagnale is, but never quite manages to catch up to him.  There is the yearly Christmas Eve phone call from Abagnale to Hanratty (because both end up alone on Christmas).  <p>We do get to see some of the cons that Frank Abagnale pulls off, but we never quite see his preparation or learn the reason why Abagnale is conning.  It takes something away from an otherwise excellent movie.  <p>I would recommend this movie as I thought it was quite good, but if I had to choose between Abagnale's book and the movie, I would take the book any day of the week.</p></body></html>

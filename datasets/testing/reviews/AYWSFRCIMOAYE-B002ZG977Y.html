<meta name="summary" content="Fake 3d effects + Shallow characters + Quick and Jerky Fighting Scenes"></head><body><p>The first disappointment with this movie is the fake 3D effects. They looked like scenes cut out of cardboard then put one behind another to create virtual depth. It's terrible. It was actually shot in 2D then "magically" transferred to 3D to cash in on the 3D fever.<br /><br />The second disappointment was the characters were shallow.  The ones in the original 1980 script moved me with their depth and human feelings. Of course the special effects of the '80 movie were laughable.<br /><br />The fighting special effects of this film were a mixed bag. In one hand, it's very impressive. For example, the giant scorpions looked scary, and  real. On the other it's disturbingly disappointing because the fighting were filmed so quickly and jerkily I could hardly saw what were happening.<br /><br />In short, it's a waste of my money.</p></body></html>

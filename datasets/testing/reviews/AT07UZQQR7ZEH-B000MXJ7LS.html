<meta name="summary" content="Oliver Stone at his most  powerful and exhilarating"></head><body><p>Oliver Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER is a powerful and disturbing masterpiece that left me proud to be an American.  Working with a brilliant screenplay by Andrea Berloff, Stone is free of political agendas and cooking on four burners here.  We are about to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the tragic 9/11/01 terrorism events.  So Stone and Berloff could not be more timely with a movie about one aspect of those events.<br /><br />There must be a hundred stories about 9/11 that could be told, including Paul Greengrass' gut-wrenching UNITED 93 earlier this year and a documentary by Frenchmen on one fire brigade inside the twin towers five years ago.  The writer and director here focus on two real-life Port Authority policemen, the rookie Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) and Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage).  They remain trapped under tons of rubble inside the ruins of the twin towers, while their sympathetic and complex wives Donna and Allison (Maria Bello and Maggie Gylenhaal) watch TV reports and await phone calls.  Stone and his editors cut back and forth, both dramatically and visually, between the darkness with the two trapped officers and the sunny brightness of the anxious wives.  All four main actors give magnificent performances.  And many extras are played by the real-life survivors of 9/11, who just play themselves.<br /><br />Stone told NEWSWEEK, in an August 7th cover story,  that WORLD TRADE CENTER was more a film about heroism than about terrorism.  I  have not seen the critically-acclaimed UNITED 93 yet, but the two movies should make a good double bill, if Stone's movie were not (an engrossing) 130 minutes.  He does show the aftermath of the twin tower attack and debris all over downtown Manhattan, without ever showing any terrorists.  Rather, Stone and Berloff (with an original screenplay refreshingly free of both gratuitous profanity and smoking) want to tell the exhilarating true story of two Port Authority policemen and their families on that fateful day--exhilarating because they come home to their wives with hugs, albeit long hospital recoveries.  People fearing a bleak ending, like UNITED 93 surely has, should know that Stone ends with a "two years later" picnic epilogue.  But there is also an eloquent roll call of the fallen on that tragic day.  This is a story I was glad to see told, and told by a master filmmaker at his best.<br /><br />The sets and visual effects, the falling debris and fires inside the towers where the two men are trapped, along with a lot of makeup blood, are awesome and deserve Oscars.  Clearly, a sizeable amount of WORLD TRADE CENTER was filmed on location.  But the set designers have built the twin tower ruins convincingly on a huge vacant lot in Marina Del Rey, south of Los Angeles.  It looks like the real thing to me as a film scholar who has been to NYC once long ago.<br /><br />Oliver Stone is the perfect filmmaker to make a 9/11 movie.  Working with real main characters, he is restricted in telling their dramatic stories faithfully and honestly.  Critics of him from, say, the underrated masterpiece JFK (1991), because of political agendas and polemics getting in the way of the storytelling, should be pleased to know that he just wants to tell a great story in WORLD TRADE CENTER; one about ordinary men and women as heroes.  It should make most moviegoers proud to be Americans.  I do hope it does well at the box office and on home video--incidentally, it was sensibly shot "flat" and not in "scope", so it should translate to pan/scan cable nicely.  Maybe for DVD, Stone can also lighten the twin tower rubble scenes a little; they were underlit in my tiny suburban multiplex screening room.  Unless he wants that much darkness for the scenes with McLoughlin and Jimeno.  Maybe they and the very gifted Berloff could all be interviewed on DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Get Smart-Steve Carell was perfect"></head><body><p>Get Smart was an excellent five star comedy starring Steve Carell who was absolutely perfect for the role.  I did not expect much from this film and saw it only because I enjoy Steve Carell's work in The Office. This film was more funny than the original series and I couldn't stop laughing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unremarkable action film kept afloat by the presence of Bruce Willis"></head><body><p>"Realistic" is not a word that springs to mind in connection with the "Die Hard" films and "Die Hard 4.0" is no exception. Over the top action sequences, people who refuse simply refuse to die, and of course criminal masterminds who don't kill the "good guys" when they are given the chance - they're all here.<br /><br />For the most part it is unexceptional although it does contains one good over-the-top action sequence which - if it actually occured - would have resulted in many hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage!<br /><br />Bruce Willis's wisecracks and charm keep this one afloat.</p></body></html>

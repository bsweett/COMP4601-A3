<meta name="summary" content="Collector's Edition DVD"></head><body><p>This film plays more like a Black Comedy, than a Horror Film, partly due to the fact that Griffin Dunne's character Jack Goodman, isn't to be taken too seriously. Also, due to the fact that John Landis (The Blues Brothers, Trading Places), is also known for comedy films. So, the script, tends to look at the humor, rather than the horror. In any case, the film is entertaining, and when the film came out, 1981, it was a different approach, to the material, that's been done before.</p></body></html>

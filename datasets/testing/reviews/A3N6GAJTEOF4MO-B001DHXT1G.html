<meta name="summary" content="A Great Nod To Everything Hulk"></head><body><p>I think we can all safely say we've put that 2003 attempt at a Hulk movie out of our minds. Sure it was aweful, and made some of us sweat with sheer hatred at the boredom we suffered. When made aware of this film some simply sighed and said, "keep Ang Lee as far away as possible" he's a great director but isn't a comic book movie maker. This adaptation wasn't a sequel, nor was it a reinvention, it was simply a nudge in the right direction and had Louis Leterrier say this is how it should have been done.<br /><br />Ed Norton now takes the role as Bruce Banner and is supported by the sexually appealing Liv Tyler. Yes, I said sexually appealing. The film starts off in Brazil where Bruce is hiding from the United States army and keeping the Hulk at bay. He works in a bottling plant and one day cuts himself leaving a drop of blood in one of the bottles, which makes an un-witting Stan Lee very ill indeed. By the way, off topic a little but can Stan Lee please stop with the cameos. Yeah, we get it Stan, you came up with the characters it doesn't mean you have to appear in every single Marvel movie ever made.<br />Back on topic. The Army track Bruce through the sick Stan Lee and employ Emil Blonsky, a man who's very high ranking in the British Royal Marines and is entrusted to bring Banner back to the states. Things don't go too well and the Hulk is awakened and destroys the soldiers, escaping once again. Blonsky isn't happy and with the help of General Thadeus Ross, he is put in the super soldier program for round two with the Hulk.<br />Meanwhile, Banner wants a cure for the Hulk so he seeks out Betty Ross to help him cure himself along with the help of the mysterious Mr. Blue.<br /><br />I can't really go further into the story as it all comes together at the end in one excellent climax, but as you can see in the cover it involves Abomination in some way. In my review title I mention that this is a nod to everything Hulk and I wasn't kidding. Just the little things you tend to notice more if they're familiar to you. The nod to the TV show with Lou Ferrigno having a cameo and a nod to the games in the final scene, Hulk smashes a police car in two and uses the parts as make shift boxing gloves. Comparing it to the first movie, this has definitely taken more inspiration from the comics. Utilising comic villains and giving a possible hint to a villain in a future installment. The look and general feel of the film are very cartoon like but are still very cool.<br /><br />Hopefully this, along with Iron Man will lead to much more comic inspired comic book movies being made. Sure, you can give us a comic movie with the main hero, but it's not really a comic movie if you take that character and change the world around them. A very enjoyable movie and worth the time, especially for the end fight sequence between Abomination and Hulk.</p></body></html>

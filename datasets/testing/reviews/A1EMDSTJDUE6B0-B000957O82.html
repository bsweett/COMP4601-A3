<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Good"></head><body><p>This was surprisingly good. I generally don't like romances. Unless they're funny and not too syruppy. This certainly fit the bill. Gut-breaking funny at points, sad, sincere, optimistic. Not to mention great acting. Not just a date flick, but a fun laid-back movie. Give it a try.</p></body></html>

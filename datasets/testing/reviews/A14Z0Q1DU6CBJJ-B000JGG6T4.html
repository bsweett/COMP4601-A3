<meta name="summary" content="MTV influences ANOTHER movie"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie. It is dark, challenging and the performances are great.<p>Denzel Washington plays a hired bodyguard and former assassin named Creasy who is to protect an adorable little girl named Pita, played by Dakota Fanning. There relationship is phenominal. Denzel slowly warms to her personality and finds a new purpose in life behind her.<p>Denzel, once again, proves that he is one of, if not THE finest actor in hollywood. In MAN ON FIRE, he takes on 3 personalities and he flawlessly transforms from one to the next with ultimate believability. <p>Revenge is ugly.<p>Everything about the movie is entertaining and engrossing. Yet, one thing really set me off. That one thing was an MTV, flash image story-telling that frequently left me wishing they would just STOP and SHOW THE IMAGES! At times, it was okay, but at times it was frustrating and confusing. <p>Is it art? Is there a point to it? Or is it just a way to be different? I don't know. From what I saw, much of it served no purpose other than to be artsy and NEW AGE.  <p>You know that instance where you GET IT? Where you're watching a scene and you know what is happening and you know what is going to happen? Many of these scenes were dragged on excrutiatingly long and longer to the point of frustration by bizarre closeups, flashes, overdramatization and slow motion.<p>The movie's good. It deserved 4 stars, and if I hadn't gotten frustrated at numerous scenes throughout, I would have given it 4 stars.</p></body></html>

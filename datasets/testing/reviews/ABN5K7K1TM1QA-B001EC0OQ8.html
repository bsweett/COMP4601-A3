<meta name="summary" content="Classic gumshoe tale with a great cast"></head><body><p>This was John Huston's first film and some say his best.  It features a most interesting cast led by Humphrey Bogart who, one can see, had a great time playing the devil-may-care and cynical private eye, Sam Spade, a creation of mystery novelist Dashiell Hammett, who also created another cinematic favorite, The Thin Man (1934) (and sequels) starring William Powell and Myrna Loy.  Playing opposite Bogey as the tearful and treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy is Mary Astor, at the time in her mid-thirties and a veteran of many films going back to the silent era.  Interestingly enough one of the films was The Runaway Bride (1930).  In Hollywood the films never change, they just get make-overs.<p>Peter Lorre plays the perfumed and villainous Joel Cairo in a style both humorous and sinister.  His distinctive high pitched voice has become a staple of cartoon villains.  Sidney Greenstreet, the rotund one, who catches up on his reading while they await the delivery of the falcon, plays Kasper Gutman, art connoisseur and sly crook.  Elisha Cook Jr., the eternal little man with a gun, whose face seldom changes expression from that of hurtful vengeance, plays Wilmer Cook, Gutman's bodyguard.<p>What makes this film the favorite of so many is the supremely confident manner in which Sam Spade deals with not only the motley assortment of crooks and con artists, but with the police, tearful women and the district attorney.  He's a man's man whose rationality and good old fashioned common sense allow him to spot deception in the twinkling of an eye and give him the power to turn his back on love if there are strings attached.  The cosmopolitan air and the sophisticated script allow the players full scope and they are fascinating to watch.  Astor's fake tears and feigned innocence cause both Bogey and the audience to grin broadly.  And the t?te-a-t?tes among all the characters, but especially between Greenstreet and Bogart and Lorre and Bogart--the big eyes, the greedy grabbing of guns--are the kind of scenes you can watch again and again with pleasure.<p>Some see greed as the theme of this film, and indeed John Huston is very good at delineating the psychology of greed--witness also his The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)--but in the existential character of Sam Spade we see an American legend come to life.  He is the thinking man of action living life by his wits and an independent code, the kind of man who takes life as it comes but without ever losing his sense of humor, the kind of guy we'd all like to be.<p>There are a couple of earlier version of this film, The Maltese Falcon (1931) with Bebe Daniels and Ricado Cortez, and one starring Bette Davis and Warren William called Satan Met a Lady (1936), neither of which I've seen, but I understand that the 1931 version is very good.  With help from a script by Truman Capote, Huston made a kind of a spoof in Beat the Devil (1954).<p>Incidentally, in this and in The Big Sleep (1946), Bogart never really plays the gumshoe with the kind of hard-nosed disregard for conventional morality as envisioned in the novels, but is politically-corrected for the mass movie audience.  Note here however that the first thing Sam Spade does when he gets the guys unconscious is to go through their wallets.<p>Bottom line: a classic and a treat.  Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="1, 2, Freddy's Comin' for You!  3, 4, Jason's At Your Door!"></head><body><p>It has taken more than 10 years to get this promised pairing of horror icons Freddy Krueger (of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET fame) and Jason Voorhees (bemasked killer from the FRIDAY THE 13th sequels) to the silver screen, but the waiting sure has paid off.  Director Ronny Yu and screenwriters Damian Shannon and Mark Swift stay faithful to the established origins of both characters, yet they still manage to merge the two cinematic mythoi in a way that seems logical and uncontrived.  They have also peopled modern-day Springwood (Freddy's original stomping grounds) with fresh meat for the two serial killers to pursue, but most of these new characters are not the cardboard cutouts that are usually found in lesser slasher-flick fare.  Instead, the audience is offered three-dimensional characters that, with all their human foibles, are familiar, likable, and easy to relate to.  When the audience can identify with a character, it makes it all the more terrifying when the killer comes for 'em.  And gettin' terrified is what these two horror franchises are all about.<p>The basic plot: Nightmare fiend Freddy has surreptitiously and deceitfully enlisted the aid of Jason to help him spur the memories of the kiddos he once terrified in the quaint little suburb of Springwood.  If he can awaken images of himself in their memories, Freddy reasons, he will again be able to inhabit their nightmares and thereby continue his acts of terror and murder in the realm of Morpheus.  But Jason is no yes-man, and he has a deadly agenda of his own.  Eventually, this difference of philosophy leads to a showdown between our two prolific homicidal maniacs and....<p>As is the norm in the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series, a lot of gallows humor is thrown into the mix, which should definitely please fans that back Freddy in this monstrous match-up.  And those who root for Jason will be pleased to see that the ol' boy is still his reticent, esoteric self--and just as adept as ever at wielding that machete.  Add in the outstanding special FX and make-up work, the good acting, and the occasional bare female breast, and Yu and company have cooked up one "killer" of a movie!<p>The outstanding two-disc DVD set is a slasher-flick lover's wet dream.  Disc one offers a beautiful anamorphic widescreen transfer of the print, a feature commentary from the director and the two principal actors, and an amusing Jump-to-a-Death chapter-select option.  Disc two is chock-full of other wonderful extras, including deleted and extended scenes (with optional commentary), behind-the-scenes featurettes, FX featurette, trailers, and more.  Definitely a must-own for fans of the two horrific franchises, as well as for aficionados of the horror genre in general.</p></body></html>

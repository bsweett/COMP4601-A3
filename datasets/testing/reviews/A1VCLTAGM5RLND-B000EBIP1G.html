The green-screen use is laughable.<br /><br />The children could not act in this film.<br /><br />The pacing was somehow both too slow AND too fast. There were plenty of dead-air moments that failed to create suspense (people in my theater were snoring, getting up a lot, getting restless), and slow mo of poorly CG'd battle, but the storyline developement was skipped over, pushed ahead, and seemed to take a back seat to action</p></body></html>

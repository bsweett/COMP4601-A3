<meta name="summary" content="Something Between Nicholson &amp; Keaton"></head><body><p>Something's Gotta Give is a romantic comedy that pairs Jack Nicholson &amp; Diane Keaton for the first time since 1981's Reds.  The film is a romantic comedy about Harry Sanborn (Mr. Nicholson), a 63-year-old playboy who is infamous for never having been married.  Harry has a penchant for women half his age and the film opens with him driving to the Hamptons home of 30-year-old Marin (Amanda Peet).  Marin's mother is a famous playwright, Erica Barry (Ms. Keaton) who is not supposed home.  While Harry is in the kitchen, Erica &amp; her sister Zoe (Frances McDormand) come into the house and mistake him for an intruder.  When Erica finds out he is dating her daughter, she immediately dislikes Harry.  While engaged in some foreplay with Marin, Harry suffers a mild heart attack and is rushed to hospital.  The scene of Harry being taken in on a gurney will be repeated several times throughout the film.  The attending physician, Dr. Julian Mercer, turns out to be a big fan of Erica's and asks her out to dinner.  Harry is forced to recuperate at Erica's house and sparks fly between the two and they end up sleeping together.  The romance doesn't last as Harry is not the commitment type and Erica is heartbroken.  The play Erica is writing ends up to be about the their relationship and it is a smash hit and Erica ends up with Julian.  Harry has second thoughts about the relationship and eventually tracks Erica down to Paris where she is with Julian.  In the end, Erica &amp; Harry end up together with Marin being married and having a baby.  Ms. Keaton won a great deal of praise for her role including winning a Golden Globe and garnering an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.  While Ms. Keaton is good in her role, her character seems a bit too whiny.  The premise of the movie is supposed to be that middle-aged woman are desirable as they have strength, smarts and looks even though middle-aged men overlook them for younger women.  Ms. Keaton comes off as flighty and emotionally high strung that puts her against the premises.  Her relationship with the much younger doctor is the retort to Harry's dalliances with younger women, but it doesn't seem to be a believable relationship.  Mr. Nicholson is perfect in his role, as he is essentially playing a character he has played numerous times.  Ms. Peet is also quite good as is Ms. McDormand in a under utilized part.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="PURE ENTERTAINMENT..."></head><body><p>This is a razzle, dazzle, knock you out of your seat with special effects, kind of movie. It is non-stop entertainment, and a worthy sequel to its predecessor, "The Mummy". Even though the plot is thin, and character development is almost non-existent, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />Archaeologists Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) have tied the knot since the original movie and have an eight year old son, Alex, adorably played by Freddie Boath. While on an archaeological dig in Egypt, they recover a special, golden bracelet which conveys special powers to the person who wears it. Alex, not knowing this, puts on the bracelet which had, at one time, belonged to the Scorpio King, played by wrestler, The Rock.<br /><br />Evie's brother (John Hannah deliciously reprises his original role) is mistaken for Rick, as mysterious emissaries try to kill him in an attempt to recover the bracelet on behalf of the evil Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo reprising his original role). As Evie and Rick continue to do battle against these evil, murderous emissaries, the mysterious and devastatingly attractive, Medjai warrior, Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr also reprising his original role), joins them in their battle against evil.<br /><br />In this sequel, past and present collide, and reincarnation adds its own interesting, little twist to the plot. For my money, Oded Fehr walks away with the movie, as Ardeth Bay is such a compelling character: sexy, swashbuckling, and mystical, all rolled into one. He is definitely my favorite character. I hope that we will see even more of him in the next sequel. (Who are we kidding? Of course, there will be another sequel!)<br /><br />The only negative thing that I have to say about the movie has to do with the animation of the Scorpion King at the end. It is too cartoonish. I found it jarring and distracting, as it did not seem to fit with the other graphics used throughout the movie which were great. It made me give the movie four stars, rather than the five I would probably have given, had this concept not been so annoying. It was unnecessary to have this cheesy looking animation, as it detracted from the movie and downgraded its overall quality.<br /><br />Still, see this movie. It is escapism at its best, as well as pure entertainment.</p></body></html>

Watching it now, one is amazed at the number of cliches that the makers managed to cram into every crevice of the plot; they only seem like cliches now, though, because so many other action films have incorporated them so shamelessly in the interim.  Aside from the tired second installment (the working title was "Die Hard: In An Airport This Time!"), the franchise, even at this late date, shows considerable steam.  That is to say, if you like action movies, you should LOVE this thing.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is back, balder than ever, as John McClane, a New York cop who can never catch a break.  This time around, not only are homegrown terrorists sticking their fingers into every digital device in the country, but his daughter has also pretty much disowned him.  Timothy Olyphant (I will always know him as the stubbornly practical drug dealer from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767835093">Go</a>) is our Main Bad Guy, a national securities expert who was dismissed and disgraced by our country's leaders for daring to suggest that our computers needed a few more firewalls.  He returns with a giant truck full of fancy electronics and less-fancy hackers in an attempt to wreck havoc and steal money (or digital files that represent money these days).<br /><br />The start-up work for his Terrorist Inc. was done by a group of clueless computer nerds who have since been dispassionately dispatched of by a team of big-jawed foreign men with oversized guns (natch).  All of them, that is, except one: Matt Farrell, played by Justin "almost, but not quite, Tom Hanks, Jr." Long.  When the nation's head servers experience a troubling blip, every techno-geek in the country is summoned, and McClane is sent to grab Farrell.  Just in time to stop him from being ventilated and charred by the Vanload Of Henchmen.<br /><br />With America experiencing the national equivalent of a seizure (traffic systems down! phones no longer work! power goes out everywhere! walkie talkies hish annoyingly! the only thing on TV are old State of the Union speeches! Noooooooo!), it's up to the blunt force of McClane and the wire-wise smarts of Farrell to take down the almost-omniscient cyber-villains.<br /><br />Willis, as gruffly charming as ever, is starting to show his age here, but the movie actually capitalizes on that.  It means that he doesn't crack wise as often as you'd might expect, but it does give us a chance to watch him fuss over his grumpy daughter when she gets felt up by a lascivious (non)boyfriend.  It also makes a perfect counter-point to Long's stumbling sensibleness, an act he's perfected since his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IZJZIU">Accepted</a> days.  After a perfectly choreographed disaster sequence involving a dark tunnel, several dozen collisions, and a helicopter, McClane is noticeably hurt.  As the two limp away from the wreckage, Farrell says, "Hey, this is no joke.  You should go to the hospital.  I'm not a doctor, but it looks like you're hurt."  McClane grimaces and says, "Sexy, isn't it?"<br /><br />Even when McClane isn't wrily thumbing his nose at these ridiculous action movie conventions ("Where do you get all your henchman?" he asks Olyphant.  "Is there an 800 number you can call?"), he's waxing prosaic about the more human impact of being a hero.  In some movies, this would be the lag where you run to get a refill on your soda, but Willis and Long pull off the moment without resorting to overfed emotion.  It shows McClane at his most vulnerable, which makes the ensuing theatrics all the more exciting.<br /><br />For what it wants to be, "Live Free or Die Hard" is a rousing success.  In fact, I'm hard-pressed to think of anything that's wrong with the film.  It shows strides beyond the days of its granddaddy, and even if there is still a little cheese left in the series, it's served up glowing red and bubbling hot.  The lactose-intolerant should stay away.  The rest of you should have a seat, grab a snack, and say, "Yippie-kay-yay."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Harry ventures into the Chamber of Secrets"></head><body><p>"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is an excellent sequel, superior and darker in tone than "Sorcerer's Stone." Daniel Radcliffe has grown as an actor,along with Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) There are special effects,but they don't overshadow the story's central mystery. Who is the heir of Slytherin? What dwells in the Chamber of Secrets?<br /><br />When I went to see "Chamber of Secrets",it was to celebrate that I was no longer working for a Christian school that labeled the series demonic- and to look at Kenneth Branagh. Branagh shines as the conceited pretty boy Gilderoy Lockhart. He's marvelously smarmy.<br /><br />In "Chamber of Secrets", Harry is warned to not return to Hogwarts by a house elf. Bravely,he returns anyhow. Students are being petrified. He hears menacing voices&sees bloody writing on the walls. Ron's sister, Ginny, also has a creepy crush on him. In the end,he confronts a giant snake,rescues Ginny,and battles Voldemort's younger,ghostly self.<br /><br />There are disturbing sequences-such as Harry&his friends being taught to cut up mandrake roots,which resemble infants. Harry also meets Moaning Myrtle,a girl who was killed in the bathroom. Possession is hinted at with the characters of Harry and Ginny.<br /><br />"Chamber of Secrets" is one of the better Harry movies. It's stronger than its predecessor,and worth venturing into-if you dare!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="classic SCI FI!!"></head><body><p>This was cutting edge SCI FI in its time and surprising holds up rather well even today.  Though back then we thought of Leslie Nelson as a very serious dramatic actor.  Now after Police Squad and Mr. Magoo, it somehow takes on a slightly different light, making you wish they included the out-takes!!!<p>It is great to see this classic in such clean crisp form!  Based on Shakespear!!!<p>A must for every collector!!</p></body></html>

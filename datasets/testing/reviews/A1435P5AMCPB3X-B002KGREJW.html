<meta name="summary" content="Funny yes, but it builds to it."></head><body><p>This is a good movie, but not the funniest of the year by far, nor of all time. This movie really starts off slow, and after a while things wind up falling into place, then the real laughter starts.  By the end, it ends up being a really funny movie.  This is a good movie to rent, but I would not spend the extra to buy this.  This has good dark humor, greg kinnear's and steve correll are both funny, and this is a great showing of a dysfunctional family, and a worst case scenario of whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.  worth a watch.</p></body></html>

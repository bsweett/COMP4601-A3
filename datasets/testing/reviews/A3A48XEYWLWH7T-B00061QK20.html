The warrior claims to have vanquished three assassins who have plagued the royal household for years.  Through a variety of flashbacks we view the different angles of the story as told to the King until it is completely at odds with what was originally expected.  Compared to Crouching Tiger this film lacks the epic scope and humanistic sweep.  It tries too hard to be attractive.  There are moments of sumptuous beauty as the fights are framed and CG effects are poured in.  The wire work is great and the color palettes change in dramatic fashion with the combatants.  The film asks the viewer to make a lot of logical jumps for the purpose of plot advancement, and to embrace fully its eventual coda.  I wasn't quite ready to do that, but that didn't hinder me from enjoying the ride.</p></body></html>

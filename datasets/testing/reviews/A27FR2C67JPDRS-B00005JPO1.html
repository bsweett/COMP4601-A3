<meta name="summary" content="Dust off your fedora, Dr. Jones is back!"></head><body><p>Dust off the old brown fedora and crack out the whip, Dr. Jones is back....Dr. Henry Walton Jones, Jr., that is!  For the long awaited fourth installment of the Indiana Jones franchise, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg bring the aging action hero back to life, older and worn but still finding himself at the center of amazing archeologicial adventures.<br /><br />  After a run-in with Russian baddie, Irina Spalko, played by Cate Blanchett (a deliciously wicked villainess, by the way!) and drawing the attention of the FBI, Jones is forced into a leave of absence from his professorship at the university.  Before he can get out of town, however, a young man named Mutt Williams, (played by Hollywood's current "IT" boy, Shia LeBouf, in full-on Marlon Brando/James Dean mode) convinces the doctor to take a look at the case of a crystal skull, an artifact believed to be part of the Amazonian legend of the mysterious city of gold---in fact, a key to finding the well hidden city.  With a mutual friend, Oxley, in jeopardy as well as Mutt's mom in peril, the two adventurers set off for Peru to find Oxley's whereabouts and search for the crystal skull.  Of course, the Russians, led by Irina, are not far behind, racing neck and neck, as one would expect, in order to find the artifact and the city's mysteries and treasures.<br /><br />  Indy 4 is a fun ride, a nostalgic return for many of us to the days of our youth.  This addition to the franchise is entertaining, full of great CGI effects and give us both familiar and new characters, welcomed additions to the Indy universe.  All the essential elements are there for an Indiana Jones film---nail-biting chase sequences, the inevitable Indy snake scene, a little romance and some great one liners!  Although I enjoyed the movie, I will say there was something lacking from the film that I found so pleasing in the earlier films.  I'm not sure what it is, to be honest, but there was just a missing spark that left me not quite satisified.  Nonetheless, it is a worthy addition to a summer movie season that seems to be brimming with more hits than misses---and for that, I am grateful!<br /><br />  Harrison Ford does well as the older Indy and falls into his role with apparent ease.  Cate Blanchett with her tidy bob haircut and pale skin is an icy and ambitious foe, a worthy adversary for Indy and Co.  Mutt is an interesting new addition to the cast though a certain revelation about him midway through the film can be seen a mile away.  And, the return of Miriam (Kate Allen), the hard drinking, acid-tongued heroine of the film that started it all, takes the fans full circle. Jim Broadbent and John Hurt, both fine actors, figure into the story, though Broadbent to a lesser degree.<br /><br />  The ending sets the stage for a possible new chapter in the Indy chronicles with Mutt, perhaps, as the heir to Indiana's adventurous ways. I'm sure we haven't seen the last of Dr. Jones, and with this weekend's huge talley (something like 126 million not counting the actual Memorial Day take) it is likely in a few years we'll be watching a fifth installment...and I doubt you'll get few complaints about that!</p></body></html>

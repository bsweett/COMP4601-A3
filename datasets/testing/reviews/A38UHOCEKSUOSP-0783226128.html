Though some people who love this movie see it for entertainment purposes (and the "Say hello to my little friend" scene is certainly one of the most entertaining in cinematic history) much more can certainly be said about the real purpose behind Scraface.  A simple message is implied by the end of the film, though its pretty obvious from nearly the beginning as well, and that is, now matter how much you "fly straight" in this dirty business, your fate is basically already written.  Its almost ironic.  Scarface is easily the cliche of a film you never want your children to see, yet at the same time, the message and the way that is portrayed is something they need to understand, though with the 200+ "f" words and the excessive violence and drug content, it probably is better to play it safe about allowing younger audiences to watch Scarface.  However, compared to films like the present day American Gangster with Denzel Washington, Scarface is beginning to feel milder all the time.<br /><br />Al Pacino is the star here, naturally, and its amazing how different his acting abilites for his Cuban character "Tony Montana" are compared to his famous role in The Godfather.  It takes a bit to get used to the accent, but his lines become those you love to quote, and eventually you want to both love and hate Tony Montana at the same time.  The supporting cast is just as impressive, but considering the film was released in 1983, you have to expect a couple of cheesy, overacting at some point.  Same goes for the music.  I actually love the score, though it is very 80's with songs like "She's on Fire" played in the club.<br /><br />The movie takes a patient watch, running a little under 3 hours in time.  Scenes either move along quickly or get dragged down, but when the action roles it stay real and perfecly in flow with the story.  Aside from the final shootout in the film, the gun fire scenes and other forms of violence are just enough to progress the plot, instead of providing mass entertainment (though with this kind of film, violence for entertainment purposes begins to tread over tricky waters).<br /><br />Scarface has become one of those films everyone needs to watch at least once.  Whether you will like it or hate in in the end, it has become so popular you just have to find out what all the hype is about.  It really is a great film, and chances are you may only dislike it for the obsessive dirty business protrayed.  It can be entertaining to some, but also realize the film makes a point and says something.  With that said, I believe its possible for anyone to enjoy this film.  Scarface doesn't have the best action, acting, etc. in a film, but it certainly goes down as one of greatest Gangster movies of all time with a teriffic story.<br /><br />The Platinum edition has been remastered, both video and audio.  The video wasn't overaly impressive, but the audio was fantastic, especially the gun explosions in the finale.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5</p></body></html>

Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />Fantastic stuff. What it lacks in acting and personality comes back and more in soundtrack. visuals, pure awesome stunning action, and scriptwriting. Not only is this one of the biggest parties of recent years, (which is why it should have been a June/July release,) but it also deals with the mind of Tony Stark in a way nobody realizes because they are used to it. Something that we've all been through, giving up. Some of us actually do end at a drunk party with us as the host, but I believe we can be like Tony Stark and become successful.<br /><br />BARACK OBAMA! WHY ARE YOU WRITING MY REVIEW? I, I just though YOU DID NOT THINK I, I please sir GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, AND INFACT, GET OUT OF THE WHITEHOUSE! *Barack Obama walks out*. JOHN MCCAIN?!?? Okay, enough of that, but seriously folks, this definably is smarter than people think. Go and watch Mr.Blacks reviews of the two, then reverse em' and you got me. In my mind, the second was better than the first. Why? Everything is improved. While some bad things are added, actually a lot, it all blends in too the superhero type of movie.<br /><br />Lemme just say this is hyper-action. Super Hyper-Action at points. There may not be enough, but lemme put it this way. 100 pounds of crap vs. 1 pound of gold. Which would you take? You can't just go get 99 pounds more just because it's more even when you get crap. You want gold. Now, it's not quite that ratio, there are plenty of action scenes, but not nearly enough to make the hardest of critics realize. I used to think my eyes were hurting from watching too many movies I though I wasted on. Man, what do people like Zaranyzerak and Mr. Black think?<br /><br />I mean, I should have just said hyper-action and you should have spent the 20 bucks this is worth! Heck, make it 22 for a large bucket of popcorn. You also get some candy with that 22 and maybe a soda. But lemme say the visuals are also spectacular. You can't beat laser beams going everywhere while robots are going everywhere BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE! The soundtrack. The soundtrack, the soundtrack, the soundtrack. AC/DC. What else do I need to say? Well, I do. Only two times is AC/DC used, at the beginning and at the credits.  Not the very beginning though.<br /><br />The only thing I would have liked changed was Mickey Rourke's character and Hammer. Those two, ugh. I wish they knew how to communicate. Things would have worked much better, but, it does add to an element of utter compositions that lead to the apocalypse of dry air into humanity releasing gasses that shall poison all discriminating laundry detergents! But, they do a good job for what they have. All the characters are annoying really, but I can get over those. But the two I talk about I cannot get over. Tony's ego is appropriate, the ladies anger is appropriate. The politicians bull$#!T is appropriate, but not not being able to understand Russian!<br /><br />But the real reason to go to this movie is for the hyper-action, if you have no patience, fall asleep for a while. You'll miss some good stuff, so I don't recommend it.  All in all, alsoulutely awesome stuff. I can't agree more with what the people over at Marvel were thinking. For my rating, I give Iron Man 2 (Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh) 5.8/5</p></body></html>

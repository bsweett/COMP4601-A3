<meta name="summary" content="A very minor step-up from previous film"></head><body><p>I'm am one of the few probably who never liked Napoleon Dynamite, done by Jared Hess. It didn't even had a plot so much as one series of mishaps after another that eventually led to something, which is okay if the film was actually funny. For the "hugely anticipated follow-up", Hess enlisted Jack Black, set it in Mexico and centered it around wrestling. While it does feel at times a step-up, it's ultimately one of those films where the bright spots than get completely overshadowed by something totally ridiculous.<br /><br />Ignacio is a monk/chef working in a Catholic orphanage. He secretly longs for the career of a Mexican wrestler. It can work since prize money, even if he loses, can afford the children better food than the hard-to-determine stuff he has to feed them. Only thing is is that the church frowns upon it, as well as his crush, nun Encarnacion (are they serious with this name? Don't know if it's an actual cultural name but eek). He decides to go ahead with it anyway, even having to fight professional wrestler Ramses.<br /><br />While I'm not bragging, I always prided myself on being very open-minded about music or film, not once considering something "beneath me". Sure I watch films like Seven or Terminator 2 but then you'd see in my DVD collection several romantic comedies or some animated children's films. Why bother mentioning it? Well it ties into some of the film's gags: reliance on scatological, or "potty humor". On more than one occasion, Ignacio does some flatulence almost as if that's so basic that anyone will laugh at it. Star Jack Black's portly belly is on display several times throughout the film and there's the stock joke of somebody ready to hit somebody with something only missing and hitting a friend/girlfriend/relative instead (in this case, it's a big woman with a crush on Ignacio's friend Steve only to have her disappear from the story).<br /><br />Ultimately though how's the casting? Well one reviewer pointed out once about Tom Cruise that it seemed like he was playing himself who was playing a character. Jack Black is slightly similar in that we can't seem to separate the actor from the character, as if their star power is too noticeable. So of course we have certain Jack Black-isms throughout the film and even a moment where he sings, as if the script writer thought there should be something for Tenacious D fans. Oddly I rented Spanglish as well which has a bit of a similar tone but it also had a particular cast member who shined above the rest. In that case it was Paz Vega, or even Shelbie Bruce, and here it's Ana de la Reguera. While not exactly the biggest outlet for talent, she does have that sincerity and likability that you'd wanna fight for her too (not to mention absolutely gorgeous of course).<br /><br />Luckily I don't judge directors on previous films (if that were the case, Spielberg would get a huge rant from me because of 1941 and Always) but Napoleon Dynamite was one of the most overrated films I've seen but Nacho Libre on its own shows there's something brewing underneath but ultimately still feels limited by its old jokes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Made with a lot of love and affection; just not that good."></head><body><p>"Starsky & Hutch" is not the worst movie made from a TV show...that list is way long...but it's not that good of a movie either.<br /><br />Other reviewers have outlined the plot, such that it is.<br /><br />It's clearly made with a lot of care. The soundtrack, the sets, the dialogue, the hairstyles...it's "fun."<br /><br />The screenplay is lazy, but it's sort of like lazy in a "70's TV show" kinda way, so this might be intentional. Owen Wilson's wisecracks are occasionally funny, but are also anachronistic. Ben Stiller adds another ballistically whacked-out character to his resume...he's fearless in his goofiness, surpassed only by Will Ferrell (who has a small, extraordinarily weird part in this film) among our current actors.<br /><br />Much has been said about Snoop Dogg, and his casting is fine. He's not an actor, but he's funny enough being Snoop-as-Huggy Bear.<br /><br />Many other actors, like Fred Williamson, overact to the point of absurdity, while somebody like Jason Bateman barely registers as Vince Vaughn's compadre. Vaughn is solid, as always, with the lines he's given.<br /><br />While watching the film, we sometimes became impatient. Lines fell flat. Scenes just didn't work. But as the movie progressed, it did gain some sort of momentum where we did want to know how it ended.<br /><br />That may be faint praise, but I know all of you have seen movies where you couldn't care less how it ended because they were that bad ot that boring.<br /><br />This isn't in that category. It's funny in spots, but not uproariously so.<br /><br />I will say this: the ending was worth waiting around for.</p></body></html>

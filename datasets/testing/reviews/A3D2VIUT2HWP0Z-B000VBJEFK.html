<meta name="summary" content="Delightful and Plain Fun"></head><body><p>Amazon reviews, the editorials, sometimes amaze me; What person is going to have a "Gag Reflex" after seeing animated rats?<br />This is an artfully done film, created in the Disney-esque tradition of making animals so lovable and anthropomorphic.The basic premise of the Rat who had culinary  ambitions is the leaping off point for many laughs and a great joy ride.<br />The DVD is well done, except that the extras that relate to the film somehow do not.The one extra you will laughing LOTS at is "LIFTED", this is a very good addition, and well worth the words of an extra.The material stated as extra which more closely relates to the film is<br />essentially a waste of time, and not worth a look out, certainly not entertaining like the feature and the extra LIFTED.</p></body></html>

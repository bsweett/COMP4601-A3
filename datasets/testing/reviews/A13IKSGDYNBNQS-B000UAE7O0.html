<meta name="summary" content="Near the mark"></head><body><p>The film commences with "Our forthcoming presentation" an excellent fake trailer for "Machete". However if you check the IMDB you will find that Machete is a film in production! In the trailor for Machete the whole plot seems to be given away - now doesn't that sounds familiar. So what about Planet Terror? Well having recently watched Death Proof I really wasn't expecting much, but this is much nearer the mark than Tarantino's effort.<br /><br />A zombie movie, with classy B movie actors who supply the type of performance you would expect from a major production that pays homage to many movies from the 1970's and 1980's. So long as you've got a reasonably strong stomach and you don't mind the slightly 1970's misogynist edge to the whole thing its really entertaining.<br /><br />I was never a fan of Rodriguez until I saw Sin City, and this is almost as good as that. It only lets itself down in one area, that is the fake early 1970's era scratchy film quality which is over-played hugely. Its a one-joke technique played for 1 hour 40 min. Overall though great fun.</p></body></html>

Beware, as it isn't for the faint of heart, as it contains strong violence but great humor like in Kill Bill. The movie is divided into 3 parts. The first one is concluded at the end. I don't want to give anything away but Bruce Willis plays a cop with a heart problem hunting a pedophile; Mickey Rourke is a BEAST ( he's huge) framed for murder; Clive Owen hunts down crooked cops and tries to save prostitutes from extermination. It's a must see and is original as it is in balck and white with color only appearing at certain moments. Reccomended for anyone that wants to watch a movie that's just absolutely AWESOME!</p></body></html>

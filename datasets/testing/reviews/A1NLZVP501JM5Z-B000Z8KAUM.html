<meta name="summary" content="Wow.  Great surprise, best in the series"></head><body><p>So of course when I heard Oceans 13 was coming out I had to watch the 2nd installment.  I liked the first but was left with no desire to see the sequel.  So I watched the sequel which was alright, nothing great, but a fun little movie.  But for this movie my expectations were low.  But to my surprise this was a great movie.  Al Pacino is great and fresh as the new villain and everyone else is great.<br /><br />Part of my problem with the first one was that the first hour seemed like filler.  The heist was great but nothing else really happened.  In the second one I thought the dialouge was much better and funnier.  But the heist was nothing great.  In Oceans 13 they have taken the great heist from the 1st and the great dialouge of the 2nd.  And yes the 2nd has some cheesy dialouge but that is absent for the most part too.<br /><br />Overall there isn't much to say.  This is funny, exciting, and it feels fresh.  Opera is the subject of some of the funniest moments in the movie, along with a Mexican workers strike.  Overall this is silly, ridiculous and fun.<br /><br />Great movie.</p></body></html>

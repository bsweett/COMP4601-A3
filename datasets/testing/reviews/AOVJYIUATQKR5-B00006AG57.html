<meta name="summary" content="Family seems to like this even more than the 1st."></head><body><p>The sword fights, the "save my wife" the addition of a kid to the cast make this a family favorite for the adults, my sons and my daughters. I am constantly in search of movies that i can share with my whole family.  This one qualifies.  As with the first movie, we have to skip one scene of near nudity but otherwise this is now one of our favorite movies.<p>Way to go stephen sommers!</p></body></html>

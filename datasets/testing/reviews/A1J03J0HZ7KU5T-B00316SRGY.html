<meta name="summary" content="Classic Eastwood"></head><body><p>A superlative achievement, Clint Eastwood's "Gran Torino" (2008) charts new territory for the legendary actor-director while continuing his cinematic winning streak. The fact that Eastwood made this film and the powerful "Changeling" in the same year is nothing short of astonishing. Just when you thought Clint had retired from acting, he emerges with another classic portrayal as a redemptive veteran in a changing urban landscape. Hollywood rarely gets it right these days, but Eastwood delivers the goods. "Gran Torino" represents the movie icon at his absolute best.</p></body></html>

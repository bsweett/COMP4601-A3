Maybe because this movie and its music makes you feel that way. <p> Take 'America', Simon &amp; Garfunkel's super-hit, for example. My wife and I decided to get married while listening to this song. And so it goes. Elton John's 'Tiny Dancer' - extremely beautiful moment in the movie. <p> It makes me remember the fact that music seems to be there for a reason, and it is to tie sounds to your memories, to times during your life, and that is priceless. <p> Definitely worth seeing, owning, and listening to also.</p></body></html>

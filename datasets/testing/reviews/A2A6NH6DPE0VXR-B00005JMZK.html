I don't think it works that it takes place in present time with Bishop being in it though. I mean think about why that is a flaw.  Alien 3 took place in the future like a 100 years after this and the Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henrikson) character was in that. He's a human that has a android made of him and that isn't even mentioned here. Here he's just a sick rich guy who wants to explore an underground Pyramid. Oh plus he doesn't even mention aliens or have knowledge of them.  So I don't think him being in it works or even makes sense. They might as well not even have called him Bishop. The Alien movies are years in the future with spaceships and the humans don't use ships in this..they weren't even invented.<br /><br />  Don't get me wrong though this movie does have decent ideas and they are decently executed. The Alien vs Predator scenes are entertaining and cool but isn't really any use for humans being in the movie. The humans in this barely even put up a fight at all, where's Ripley when you need her ? Plus just like in Freddy vs Jason, you don't care about the humans eventhough they take up half the movie. You just want to see Aliens vs Predators and when you get it that's when there's some actual life in the movie. I guess the film-makers thought that Bishop being in it would attract fans of the Alien franchise. It would've worked if they actually thought it through. Plus having the director of Resident Evil do it wasn't a great idea either. Still though this is a better Alien movie than Alien Resurrection at least. When a movie doesn't get released for critics, you expect something horrible but this really isn't that bad.</p></body></html>

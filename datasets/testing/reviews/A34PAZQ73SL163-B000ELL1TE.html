The combination of music, lighting angles, and sheer verve in Snatch and Lock Stock... is outstanding.  I loved the plotline and suspense.  As usual, I had no idea what would happen until the end. Brad Pitt is almost as good in this movie as he was in Kalifornia; his accent is hilarious. Brick Top is terrifying and other than Dennis Farina's overacting, its hard to find any fault in this film.</p></body></html>

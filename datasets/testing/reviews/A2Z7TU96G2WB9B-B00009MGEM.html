The Hammer horror films (numerous Dracula films with Christopher Lee) had a plot line that came to a conclusion, granting that sometimes the conclusion was transitory (like the hand of the monster reaching from the grave as the movie closed).  Other films, like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," don't have the same structured narrative construction.  The story is more a basic premise that is wrapped in horrific images that are designed to get a response.  Rob Zombie's film is more like the latter.<br /><br />"House of a 1000 Corpses" has a few basic storylines that connect but like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," there is no explanation of why.  The movie is designed to get a visceral response from the audience, and this movie does this in spades.  The photography can be chaotic, which reflects what is happening to the victims.  You will feel uneasy and disturbed.<br /><br />Traditional horror fans (like ghost stories, vampires, mummies, etc.) may find this a bit too graphic and bloody.  Fans of slasher films (with the psychopathic killer) will find that Rob Zombie does know horror.</p></body></html>

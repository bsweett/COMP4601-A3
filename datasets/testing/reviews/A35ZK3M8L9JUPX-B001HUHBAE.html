<meta name="summary" content="Zodiac (Full Screen Edition)"></head><body><p>Robert Graysmith is a cartoonist who works for the San Francisco Chronicle. His quirky ways irritate Paul Avery, a reporter whose drinking gets in the way of doing his job. The two become friends thanks to a shared interest: the Zodiac killer. Graysmith steadily becomes obsessed with the case, as Avery's life spirals into drunken oblivion. Graysmith's amateur sleuthing puts him onto the path of David Toschi, a police inspector who has thus far failed to catch his man; Sherwood Morrill, a handwriting expert; Linda del Buono, a convict who knew one of the Zodiac's victims; and others. Graysmith's job, his wife and his children all become unimportant next to the one thing that really matters: catching the Zodiac. "Zodiac" may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's movie expecting a traditional serial killer thriller.  Early scenes in this movie are shocking and, compared to the rest of the movie, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective. Parts of "Zodiac" are intensely creepy. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances.  I found it to be a great story told in a remarkable way, very entertaining, with great performances, and wonderful direction.</p></body></html>

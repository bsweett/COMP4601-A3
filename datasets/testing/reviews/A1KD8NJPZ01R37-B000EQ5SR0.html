They all did.<br /><br />Excellent story (wasn't sure what they'd do with that either), but it was great. ORIGINAL, for one thing. Finding that these days is not easy.<br /><br />And GREAT. A Great Movie. It's the trifecta. If you love Sci-Fi, I don't know what your waiting for...buy it, and fall in love.<br /><br />The cartoon is good too, Intense. But dated a little, and it is anime. So, i's a toss up whether you'll like that series. Personally, I wish more people created cool and wierd entertainment that wasn't trash.<br /><br />NICE GOIN GUYS!!</p></body></html>

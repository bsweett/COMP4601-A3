<meta name="summary" content="The Best Bond Film of All Time!"></head><body><p>I know -- the ad line for every Bond film makes that statement. However, in this case, it's a reasonable claim. Goldfinger was the blueprint for the entire series. Although there have been several great Bond films since, the series never again reached the high point it attained with Goldfinger. The films has the best of just about everything of the series: the best heroine (Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore); the best villains (Gert Frobe as Goldfinger and Harold Sakata as Oddjob); the best plot; the best theme song; the best gadget (the famous Aston Martin) and, of course, the best Bond, Sean Connery. When he filmed Goldfinger, Connery had firmly defined himself as James Bond, but had not yet grown tired of the role. The gadgetry is eye-popping, even to today's audiences, but does not overwhelm the entire film as many of the later Bond entries do. This is one of the few films in the series that actually improved upon the original Ian Fleming novel. Goldfinger has transcended the series and become one of the classic cult films of the 1960's. In every way possible, Goldfinger is a true classic.</p></body></html>

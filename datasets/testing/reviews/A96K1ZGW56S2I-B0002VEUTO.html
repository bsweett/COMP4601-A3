PITCH BLACK was one of the most innovative sci-fi movies to arrive in theatres in a long time and it is, after all, the movie that really "made" Van Diesel. However, I was somewhat disappointed by the film. The movie tried to fit in all the surviving characters from PITCH BLACK and place them in a life and death situation with an invading species that is threatening the known universe, assimilating and annhiliating entire worlds at the same time on their quest to find the Underverse. Riddick isn't quite the same person he was five years ago when he blasted off from that planet of darkness. He's got compassion in his soul now. Nevertheless, he's still as smart, speedy, and strong as ever. With a kick-but character like Riddick and a fairly decent story line, you would think the movie would be top notch.<br /><br />But, it's not. Instead of building on the originality and creativity of the first movie, THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK tries for something safer and rips off some of the best stories in epic sci-fi (the Necromongers are a rip off of STAR TREK's Borg and much of the second half of the movie is suspiciously similar to DUNE). Not only that, but though the movie CAN stand on it's own as a movie, I don't think there are many people out there who will enjoy the movie if they haven't seen PITCH BLACK and know who Riddick is, which kind of defeats the purpose.<br /><br />Still, the film was interesting enough to keep my attention and even though it's largely a set-up for a third film in the series, there's enough there to make me watch it again and want to see the next movie to see how things play out. There aren't many movie sequels that can do that.</p></body></html>

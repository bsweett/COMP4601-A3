He's a lawyer but the firm won't let him practice law because he's too good at fixing the law firm's messes. When the firm's top lawyer experiences a breakdown, Michael must clean up the defense of a chemical plant land contamination. Three billion dollars are at stake and Michael has a lot on his plate - not to mention his financial and family problems.<br /><br />This was one of Sydney Pollack's last movies and he is terrific as one of the firm's big shot lawyers. Tilda Swinton received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role as legal counsel for the chemical plant.<br /><br />A great movie thriller and one of the best George Clooney films ever.</p></body></html>

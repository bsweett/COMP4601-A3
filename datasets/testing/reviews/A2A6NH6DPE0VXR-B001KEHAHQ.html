<meta name="summary" content="Martin was wrong for the part"></head><body><p>Despite being a little better than I expected, it's still not that great. There's some laughs here and there but the movie is still more stupid than it is funny.<br /><br />  While, I don't know who told Steve Martin that he'd make a good Jacques Clouseau. He has his usual look but with a brown mustache glued on. In some scenes, it appears that it's falling off his face. White hair with a brown mustache looks pretty silly as well. Kevin Kline looks more the part and could have pulled it off better. Yet, he's only wasted in a supporting role.<br /><br />  Martin simply just looks out of place and has been a lot funnier. I do like him as a comedian, I have liked many of his films. I just don't like him in this role. He's totally wrong for the part.</p></body></html>

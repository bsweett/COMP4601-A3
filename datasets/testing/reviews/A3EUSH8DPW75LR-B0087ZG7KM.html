<meta name="summary" content="Amazing comedy is superb on blu ray"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that has received such exceptional praise and a particular comparison to being a female version of THE HANGOVER that most people have high already set expectations before viewing this movie.  I did not see this in the theater and was filled with anticipation to watch the blu ray.  I love most of the women here and was not let down at all.  Funny though, after all the hype, it was not anything what I expected.  The comparison to THE HANGOVER?  This film involves a roadtrip but differs greatly for it is a comedy with heart.  Kristen Wiig is the true headliner here and she carries this film from beginning to end.  She provides many of the greatest laughs but her character also provides the true heart and emotion to this film.  Yes, it is a laughfest comedy with humor that is sometimes a little gross but under all that is a heartfelt story.  Maya Rudolph also provides heart to this film.  For the comedic part of the film the greatest performance is given by Melissa McCarthy.  This is a huge breakout performance for her.  If you aren't too happy after your first viewing of this film I highly suggest ginving it another viewing without expectation.  You will then see the many layers that make this film a huge success.<br /><br />The blu ray comes with the theatrical version as well as the unrated version.  The video is amazing and colors pop while fleshtones are realistic and lovely.  Black/white ration is excellent and the picture just jumps off the screen with a vibrant crispness.  And the clarity shows every detail in every frame to great detail.  The audio is also excellent.  Dialogue is always present and clear and when music comes the surround speakers are put to great use.  This film honestly shows blu ray at its best.  And the blu ray edition also has hours of amazing extras that are not on the dvds.  I highly recommend this film.  It is an amazing comedy with an all female cast that will have you in stitches.  But try to forget the hype and try to not have any expectations for this film is different and better than it is being described.  This is indeed a great comedy that truly touches the heart.</p></body></html>

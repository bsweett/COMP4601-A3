<meta name="summary" content="Sad attempt at being clever"></head><body><p>The movie has just ended, and for that I am grateful. It has been two hours of sincere unpleasantness. So why did I bother with it? Well, to write this review. Now that I've finished watching, I realized that I could have stopped watching within the first 30 minutes, because there wasn't much that changed. I thought it was a train wreck initially, and I didn't change my mind.<br /><br />This was an utter, complete mess. The attempts at cleverness with regard to twisting the Grimm's tales failed miserably, with one exception, and it succeeded only marginally. If I mention it, I will have put a spoiler into the review, so I won't.<br /><br />That Terry Gilliam directed this is unbelievable. I would have thought him far too good for such a wretched disaster.<br /><br />Damon and Ledger were serviceable, in their performances, but they had no chemistry together. The one scene that could have offered some form of chemistry came far too late, and was snatched away from us just in the nick of time. The one true moment of the film, and it never happened. What a pity.<br /><br />So they were charlatans, then ended up fighting real monsters, and then, we suppose, wrote their grim tales based on their experiences - giving "clever" twists to their resulting stories based on the "facts". I so want to say that I loved how clever it was, but I can't. It was only marginally clever. And whatever cleverness there was, there was a complete lack of suspense that overrode everything. With all of the action, the near death scenes, the real death scenes - there should have been enormous suspense and extremely enjoyable action.<br /><br />Nope. Wasn't there.<br /><br />Even the scenes that were supposed to be funny were flat. This evoked zero emotion from me. It should not have.</p></body></html>

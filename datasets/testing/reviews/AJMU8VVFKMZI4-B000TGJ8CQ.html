The movies I think I'll hate, I love and the ones I think I'll love, I hate.  Weird.  Anyway, my best friend encouraged me to watch this movie and I'm glad that I did.  I thought the little quirk of being to see into the future for just two minutes intriguing.  I found Chris/Frank odd and charming.  Biel was actually pretty good as a love interest in this film and I even like the big twist at the end.  Win.  Win.</p></body></html>

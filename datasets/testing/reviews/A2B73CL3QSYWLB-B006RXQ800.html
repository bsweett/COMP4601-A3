It has many of the elements in place.  Good ensemble acting(in one case, great), breathtaking art direction, costumes, and cinematography.  The one thing the film lacked was a cohesive script and ultimately that was the heart of this film.  The screenplay is credited to multiple contributors which usually is not a good sign.  Ostensibly the film concerns itself with the turf wars between the "natives" and the recent Irish emigres in New York in the mid-nineteenth century.  One of the Irish, Amsterdam Vallon, vows revenge against one of the natives, William "Bill the Butcher" Cutting for the murder of his father.  To do so he has to first gain the confidence of Bill and infiltrate his gang.  There is also a love triangle involving Amsterdam, Bill, and Jenny, a pickpocket.  Interspersed  throughout the film various historical figures pop up(Boss Tweed, Horace Greeley,P.T. Barnum) as well as allusions to historical events (Tammany Hall scandals, the Civil War draft riots).  The film probably should have focused more on the central conflict between Amsterdam and Bill and less so on these peripheral issues.  As Amsterdam and Jenny, Leonardo DiCaprio give adequate performances.  The revelation here is Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher.  Lewis embodies the villainy and brutality of Bill completely.  One chilling scene in the film is one where Bill relates how he gouged out his own eye after losing to a superior opponent in a turf fight.</p></body></html>

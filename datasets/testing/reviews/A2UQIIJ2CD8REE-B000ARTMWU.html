<meta name="summary" content="An exciting, grisly French thriller!"></head><body><p>College girl Alex has brought her school friend Marie to her family's country home for a weekend of studying and fresh air. Their relaxing visit is not meant to be, however. A deranged, perverted killer arrives at the home on the same night and slaughters Alex's parents, baby brother, and dog. Marie barely manages to go undetected as the psycho leaves the farmhouse with Alex in the back of his truck. But Marie has come along for the ride too, and throughout the long night she attempts to save her friend while having to keep unnoticed. It's all an adrenaline pumping thrill ride building up to a surprise ending where we learn the killer's true identity and the fates of Marie and Alex.<br /><br />From director Alexandre Aja, "High Tension" is a gorehound's fantasy with a touch of lesbian eroticism and plenty of what the title suggests. Though the plot is very simple and the twist perhaps something viewers have seen before in different ways, the nonstop flow of the story, excellent visual style, and outstanding performances make it a must watch for one viewing at least. Most notable are Ma?wenn Le Besco and C&eacute;cile de France in the roles of Alex and Marie respectively, and Philippe Nahon as the killer (Le tueur). The film comes to us from France and is presented in this widescreen, unrated version with a mix of English dialogue and subtitles. The extras include a DVD introduction, commentaries, 3 behind the scenes featurettes, and audio and subtitle options. The DVD lists trailers as an extra, but these are for other films. (this review refers to the widescreen, unrated edition)</p></body></html>

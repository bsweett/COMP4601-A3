As the second part of the duo, though, it lacks a little of Part One's energy.  Hence the 4 rather than 5 stars on this entry.  Uma continues to amaze here as the Bride and in this installment, I half expected her to have a shootout with Eastwood - both wearing dusters, of course!  Hannah is a hoot in this and her showdown with the Bride gives Lucy Lui a run for her money.  Excellent follow-up to an even more excellent begining.</p></body></html>

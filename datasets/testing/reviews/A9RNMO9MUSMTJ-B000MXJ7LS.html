Im glad this movie was made...to remind us when we will<br /><br />tend to forget.  The movie is pretty good, it will bring back memories, and<br /><br />even if most of the movie is about the rescue of 2 men, it brings to mind<br /><br />all related events that unfolded that day and how mankind dealt with the<br /><br />ultimate chaos....  .</p></body></html>

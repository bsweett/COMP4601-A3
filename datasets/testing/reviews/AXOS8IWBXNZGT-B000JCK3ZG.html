<meta name="summary" content="Closure"></head><body><p>I just recently got back from seeing X-Men: The Last Stand, the film which brings to a close the X-Men film trilogy.<br /><br />I am sad to report that, while the film does bring to a close to many storylines within the trilogy, it does not do so terribly well. The previous film (X2 - X-Men United) did set the bar high, , but it did so not through the use of special effects, but instead by taking the time to build up the characters, making us involved in their struggles and losses on a personal level.<br /><br />X3, at a running time of 104 minutes, feels much shorter and compressed than X2 at 133 minutes. That missing 30 minutes makes all the difference. Characters die in this movie, while a few new ones are introduced...but its hard for us to be invested in things, either way, because any caring on the part of the characters seems to have been excised out of the story.<br /><br />What is our story, this time out? Without spoiling things, I can say that a pharmaceutical company has developed a "cure" for "mutancy". This causes consternation, to say the least, amongst the mutant population, which splits along the Xavier/Magneto lines, with Magneto wanting the so-called cure destroyed. Many of the X-Men (Xavier's crowd) are still mourning the loss of Jean Grey...and when Cyclops finds her again, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Seem like two independent storylines to you? Well, they are forced together, nearly midway through the film. One storyline is about the conformancy vs. not fitting in, and choice vs. force. The other is solely about power vs. responsibility. Well, if you're going to blend two different themes together, then you should take the time to do it right. Making a straight-out action flick, in which the characters barely have a moment to mourn the death of one of their two fallen comrades, is not the way to do it.<br /><br />So, colour me disappointed. It's not a bad movie...it's just not the best it could have been.</p></body></html>

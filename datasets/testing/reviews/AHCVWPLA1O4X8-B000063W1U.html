<meta name="summary" content="Good, but not THAT good"></head><body><p>The Scorpion King is a spinoff of the Mummy and the Mummy returns movies.  It stars the Rock as Matthias, an assassin for hire who has a personal score to settle with the typical bad guy.  Along the way there's the girl, the comic sidekick, the rival turned ally, the climactic final battle...well, you get the picture.<p>Okay, so there's nothing that original here, but the Rock actually does a pretty good job of acting.  Also, there's his buddy Balthazar, played by Michael Clark Duncan (you know, that REALLY big guy from Armageddon and The Green Mile).  Besides the acting, the special effects are really cool, and the fight scenes are very exciting.  <p>The downside is simply that it's nothing new.  It's all been done before, but hey, we won't hold that against the Rock.  All in all, it's a movie worth seeing, but maybe not worth owning.</p></body></html>

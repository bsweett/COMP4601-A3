(The story takes place during World War II in England where Lucy, the youngest of four siblings [Peter, Edmund, and Susan] stumbles upon a magical kingdom named Narnia in the back of a wardrobe of a professor's mansion while playing hide-and-go-seek.)  The children find themselves in a world of animals, fauns, and other mythical beasts who are captive to a witch's spell casting a perennial winter upon Narnia.  They find themselves in an adventure to help free Narnia from the icy grip of the White Witch, Jadis, and her endless winter. (It is a fantasy much like "The Lord of the Rings" with Christian allegory, but with enough appeal to please a wider audience.)<br /><br />Fortunately, the technical development for the movie lives up to our expectations. Many comparisons have been made to Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, but, while "Narnia" owes a great deal to the former's technical excellence (mainly from director Andrew Adamson's experience with "Shrek"), "Narnia" stands on its own.  Luckily for C.S. Lewis fans, the making of this movie is very timely.  The acting, which has sometimes been undermined, is good all around.  While Tilda Swinton is aptly given praise for her role as Jadis, the White Witch, the child actors deserve accolades for their natural portrayals as the young sojourners to the Narnia world.  (Their emotional range from sibling rivalry to genuine astonishment is good throughout.) The movie is also true to the book in content and  meaning without being watered down.  It presents an absorbing story and a gripping adventure.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG, but it shouldn't scare away too many viewers.  There are some frightening moments, and, indeed, the violence, while not too graphic, will be at least a notch up from cowboy and Indian matinee movies from the fifties. (Some five-year-old viewers survived the jolts at the movie theatre better than this reviewer, and the reader can always control the volume at home.) This movie is great entertainment for people of all ages.</p></body></html>

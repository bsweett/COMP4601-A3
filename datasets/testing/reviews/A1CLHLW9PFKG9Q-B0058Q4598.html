<meta name="summary" content="No Punch"></head><body><p>In 2008 a re-make of The Day The Earth Stood Still was released to theaters.<br /><br />While the original was a warning against nuclear war, this re-make starring Keanu Reeves as the alien Klaatu, serves as a warning against global warming/ecology disruption.<br /><br />This giant sphere comes to New York and Klaatu emerges only to be shot by a lone military man.<br /><br />While under the knife, Klaatu befriends a scientist played by Jennifer Connelly who believes these aliens are friendly.<br /><br />Fat chance. They are here to collect a few specimens and then wipe out mankind.<br /><br />This updated version doesn't have the punch of the original. When you cast Keanu Reeves as your lead, you should know what you're getting yourself into.<br /><br />And GORT, the huge guardian alien has been changed altogether.<br /><br />If you must, just rent this thing for a day.</p></body></html>

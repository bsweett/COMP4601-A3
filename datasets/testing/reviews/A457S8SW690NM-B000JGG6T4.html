<meta name="summary" content="Violent, sad, amazing movie"></head><body><p>This movie is absolutely brilliant, led By Denzel Washington in a powerful performance. He plays John Creasy, once at the top of his game in the CIA, but now he's an alcoholic that takes a job as a bodyguard in Mexico City, where there are so many kidnappings that it made me feel very depressed and sad. He is to protect young Pita, played beautifully by Dakota Fanning. The movie is so powerful and sweet though thanks to the first half of the movie. In this section, Creasy becomes nicer and nicer thanks to Pita, and he falls in love with this little girl. They are now best friends, and now Creasy is no longer an alcoholic thanks to his great friendship with Pita. But when Pita gets kidnapped and Creasy gets shot, things go awry. Creasy awakens in the hospital and he is accused of having killed two cops who helped kidnap her. Creasy is released and is informed that Pita is supposively dead because the ransom exchange went awry. Creasy now is really mad and is bent on revenge. He gets some big guns and declares that he will kill everyone that was involved with the kidnapping. This section is very violent as Creasy chops off people's fingers, and wires bombs to one guy's but. Creasy is determined to show no mercy. This movie is very powerful and emotional. I almost cried because this is based on atrue story and kidnappings do occur sooooooooo very often in places like this. Washington and Fanning are both very powerful and the movie is built around them and their bond until the kidnapping. It shows that Creasy fears not his death but only wants to get revenge even if this means his death. The movie will have you laughing, maybe even crying or just staring in awe at what Creasy does. I strongly recommend this very powerful and wonderful film.</p></body></html>

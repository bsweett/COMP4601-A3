Apparently this film has end titles but the management of the cinema I attended saw fit to drop the curtains and up the lights before the film had even ended, as if to say: "right, you lot. OUT!" Or maybe it was a moment of misguided altruism: "My God, that was a turkey. I'm sure you'll all want to get out as quickly as possible!" Well, actually no. I was determined to watch it to the last excruitiating copyright symbol. Throughout the screening, a bit of curtain had inexplicably been left jutting out on the left side corner, obscuring part of the screen. Cynics might say, the less you see of Alexander, the better. In fact, there were no walk outs. Perhaps we were taken in by Oliver Stone's flattery of European audiences, and determined to sit there with an air of masochistic superiority. However, one gentlemen pretended to stretch in order to take a furtive glance at his watch. Saw that, mate. Surprising to hear so little guffawing from a country that made Life of Brian and Carry On Cleo. The only members of the audience behind me giggling were Americans. Now, I'm a terrible giggler and this should have set me off, but perhaps I was too stupified. I don't like to kick a man when he's down, so I'll merely tell you what sent the gigglers off the most. The notorious: "you love...HEEM?" followed by Alexander's bizarre wedding night, sure to be a bad movie fan classic. Then there was Alexander's Lion headset which made it look like a lion was sipping wine at one point. Bucephalus rising up against an elephant also on it's haunches (actually, that was me laughing. I definately heard myself). Surprisingly, Hephaistion's celebrated death scene did not muster so much as a titter from the giggle squad. Perhaps they had keeled over and died at that point. I was unable to keel over and die, dressed as I was, head to toe in rubber. Hey, I said us British were masochistic. Had a hell of a time getting out of the stalls, too.<br /><br />My own personal favourite bits were Alexander talking tough to his cohorts and then talking in a mincing voice to Hepheistion, as if in the closet. Eventually he appears to come out in horrified public by kissing a servant. Hang on a minute, I thought this sort of thing was accepted in those days, so who needs to come out? Another crass moment was the camera jiggling up and down, presumably to illustrate the effect of approaching elephants. Inexplicably though, in an innocuous following scene in Alexander's quarters, the camera starts jumping up and down again. I think it was pointing at a bowl of fruit or something.</p></body></html>

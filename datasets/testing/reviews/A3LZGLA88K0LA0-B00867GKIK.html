<meta name="summary" content="UP IS UPLIFTING"></head><body><p>UP seems poised to win an Oscar or Best Animated film and I can see why.  Who'd have thought a film with a 78 year old hero would be such a hit?  But UP is unique in every way from its poignant opening wonderfully displaying Carl and Ellie's courtship, marriage and her death to the fantastic adventures on Paradise Falls.  And it does so without resorting to the expected cutesiness found in most animated films.  The voice characterizations especially Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer are perfect.  UP is that rare animated movie that appeals to all ages and I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The monsters from Id!!!"></head><body><p>Leslie Neilson leads his crew to the Forbidden Planet to relieve the watch from years before. Little does he know the entire crew was killed by an evil force. All that is left is a scientist and his daughter.<p>Leslie is not the bumbling Detective Drumand in this flick. No siriee bob. Want to dream? Expect 20 extra guard duties. Wanna kiss a pretty girl? Ooh you'll get it good. But on the other hand Robby the Robot will make you 60 gallons of Kansas City Bourbon.<p>OK OK an advanced race called the Krell develop technology without machinery (you just have to follow me here). All the stuff runs on mind power. However since man (and all species now for that matter) are basiclly evil in the subconscious, you can create monsters from your Id. You'll just have to watch the movie. If you dose a little while you're watching it you'll be going &quot;huh?&quot; and &quot;what?&quot; <p>Special effects are pretty good for 1956, as is the story itself. It's a little boring for me to consider a must have classic, but I can see how this film can appeal to people on different levels. I'm more of a Plan 9 from Outer Space guy myself. I was hoping and expecting this to be a B-grade hilarious clunker. It's far from it.</p></body></html>

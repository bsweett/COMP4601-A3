<meta name="summary" content="I preferred this remake over the original"></head><body><p>In many ways, this remake of the original Swedish film is almost 80% an exact scene by scene remake.<br />However, unlike many people I found the dark lighting and backgrounds more fitting to the story in this American remake.<br />The Swedish version was very light and cheerfully bright.<br /><br />I also thought the kid actors were more powerful in this remake.<br /><br />It is a very similar remake, but I found the Swedish original a bit too artsy , while this remake used a darker and more somber tone.<br /><br />Both films are a bit on the slow moving side ... but they still hold your interest.</p></body></html>

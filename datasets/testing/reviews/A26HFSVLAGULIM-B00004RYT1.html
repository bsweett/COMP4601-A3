<meta name="summary" content="BEFORE THERE WAS JAWS TO KEEP US OUT OF THE WATER"></head><body><p>WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS:<br /><br />Sure, we all know the story. For some reason Janet Leigh steals 40 grand so that her boyfriend will stop making excuses and marry her. She ends up at the Bates Motel and the rest is cinematic  history. If you are looking for something fresh and new, "Psycho" doesn't sound too promising, but . . . .<br /><br />BEFORE THERE WAS JAWS TO KEEP US OUT OF THE WATER:<br /><br />There was Psycho to give rise to chain motels across America. Days Inns, Holiday Inns, Best Westerns and many more. No more homey mom and pop motels for us. We knew that Norman Bates was waiting to welcome us at those just like Jaws was waiting for us at the beach. Ever wonder why there are so many swimming pools in Florida and California?<br /><br />But Psycho is different. It changes moods and is very disarming, almost subtle, while at the same time utterly creepy and uncomfortable to watch. Add to that an unreliable narrator and somehow an utterly sympathetic villian.<br /><br />THE DINNER SCENE:<br /><br />The tension really mounts as the odd chemistry between Perkins and Leigh in their dinner scene reveals a common bond of estrangement and disenfranchisement with normal society and the world.<br /><br />After dinner, Norman Bates [Anthony Perkins] opens up a peep-hole in his office wall. With obvious hunger, he studies Marion Crane [Janet Leigh] as she undresses, revealing her black panties and bra, now replacing the white set from the opening scene liason with her beau. Presumably, she dons black now as she is now an embezzler.<br /><br />IN-BETWEEN:<br /><br />The middle of the film is something you'll just have to see, to believe. Suffice it to say that it has aged well and generates palpable tension and discomfort. Bernard Hermann's score ratchets the tension up a notch along with the action.<br /><br />"I WOULDN'T EVEN HURT A FLY"!<br /><br />We find out at the end, what Norman Bates motivations are, and we get it fast and concise from a head-shrinker [I mean psychiatrist]. After we feel pangs of impatience over having this nasty piece of exposition at the end, we get the real ending where we see how Mrs. Bates "wouldn't even hurt a fly", or would she?<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />Great remastered dual-layer transfer in Widescreen.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />A 90 minute documentary that features Janet Leigh and Joe Stefano [Script Writer] and others. This doucmentary is among the best I have seen on a film this old, and it includes the Assistant Director, Hilton Green's comments about the production of the film.<br /><br />A 7 minute trailer with Hitchcock walking us through the sets and a filmography.</p></body></html>

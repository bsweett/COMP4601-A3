There is a somewhat coherent storyline and the annoying Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are long gone.  I think when you're in the mood for something dumb but sorta fun, this is the type of movie you want to see.  The Blu-Ray looks great, sounds even better.  The image is a tad soft (shot on digital) compared to the first Pirates - which was tack sharp, but nothing to be ashamed of.<br /><br />Look, if the last two movies in the series never would have been made and this would have been the real Pirates sequel, it would be much higher rated.  It really is a huge improvement on Dead Man's Chest and World's End.  Those movies were genuinely awful.  This is harmless fun.</p></body></html>

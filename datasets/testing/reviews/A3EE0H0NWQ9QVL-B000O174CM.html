<meta name="summary" content="Truth Is Stranger Than 'Dream Girls'"></head><body><p>Truth is stranger than fiction.  Or at least it's very familiar in 'Dream Girls, a triumphant survey of modern black music interspersed with behind the scenes drama of backbiting, drugs, egos, and deception.  The thinly veiled look at Motown (Rainbow Records) and the debacle between key members of Diana Ross and The Supremes almost makes this whole musical historical fiction--or, I should say, non-fiction.<br /><br />It all starts, of course, with earnest talent like a James Brown-like performer (Eddie Murphy) who wows audiences and a girl group who tries to break through the fixed Detroit talent contest.  (They groom a B.B. King-like performer to win.)  Once they lose, they must depend on managers to see them through (Curtis, a very Berry Gordy-like figure played by Jamie Foxx, and an older entreprenuer (Danny Glover) who depends on his old-hand skills for catapulting stars.)  They all seek the top, but only Curtis sees what's necessary to get a black act there.  For all their talent, their records are stolen and sanitized by white singers (more than a little reminiscent of Pat Boone) and brought to the top of the charts.  Using gambling and mob money, Curtis bribes the D.J.'s to play his own music.  More galling is his maneuvering to unseat Effie White (played with spunk by Jennifer Hudson), the talented but overweight lead singer, to the backdrop and put Deana Jones (Beyonce') to the head of the group.  Even though her own mother is even perplexed by the venue change, Curtis, to his conniving credit has, cynically, the winning formula.  Everyone is at his mercy until they all either become washed up or leave his productive but overly possessive nest.  (And how many parallels can be made when Deanna and Effie  are nearly dead ringers for Diana Ross and Mary Wells?)  If that doesn't convince you that this musical movie is hardly fiction, then the near replicas for The Jackson Five surely will.<br /><br />'Dream Girls' is a glorious display of modern black music since the advent of the girl group in the early sixties.  It also intersperses well events like the riots and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's presence.  But one objection remains:  The backstage bickering is necessary, but also burdening.  When they expose the politics of alliances and talented people burned, they do it well.  That is until they sing about it; then it becomes awkward and maudlin.  Numbers like "When I Saw You" and "We Are the Family" seem sappy next to the splendor of the numbers they perform on stage.  See 'Dream Girls' by all means, but realize that it has limitations.  It is sometimes overly sentimental and embarrassing when they sing about their troubles--not as well integrated as, say, 'Chicago' in this regard.  Despite its flaws, 'Dream Girls' has a likable ensemble, a good story, and, most of all, glorious music.</p></body></html>

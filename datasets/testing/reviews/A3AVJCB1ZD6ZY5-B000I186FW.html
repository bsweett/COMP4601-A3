<meta name="summary" content="So wish I hadn't missed this in the theatres"></head><body><p>The year is 2020 and the people of Great  Britain are blind. It's not entirely their fault--the government in the persona of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has put blinders on the British as much as they are too frightened to see what is happening for themselves.<br /><br />Britons' everyday world is very much like George Orwell's "1984".  The heavily censored media controls what they see.  Language has morphed to the point where harmless words now carry a serious threat. The Party is all-powerful and can make people disappear without questions.  The countryside is mined with cameras and microphones to detect any protest and the police and military are empowered to eliminate enemies of the state. The Government may well be responsible for the deaths of over a 100,000 of its citizens due to St. Mary's virus.<br /><br />Then one dark November 5th night, Evey Hammond (Portman), a young British woman is walking home and is accosted by men bent on doing her harm.  She's rescued by a black clad figure in a Guy Fawkes mask.<br /><br />He calls himself "V."<br /><br />V (Hugo Weaving) offers truth and hope to the British people.  Taking his cue from the Guy Fawkes of history who tried to overthrow the British Government almost 4 centuries prior, V promises that in a year's time, there will be a revolution--the Parliament building will be destroyed and the old government will be overthrown.<br /><br />The film covers the next year's time.  First, the police are attempting to locate V through various means.  Evey parts from V and goes out on her own only to be captured.  And V continues to spread the word to the British people.<br /><br />Every book writer aspires to at least one good line per page.  I cannot say how many that translates to in movies, but "V" is beautifully and thoughtfully written.  In addition, the acting on the part of the major characters is good as well.  How Weaving can translate so much character without a facial expression, eludes me.  Natalie Portman's performance as Evey in captivity is also stellar.<br /><br />As I started off, I really regret not having seen this film in full screen.  I understand it's available in IMAX format and I'd love to catch it on that kind of venue.  In particular, the scenes from High Chancellor Sutler would probably be hair raising.<br /><br />Though I have rented this film, it's now on my wish list to add to my collection.  There is enough content to make "V" worth watching again--and showing to my friends.</p></body></html>

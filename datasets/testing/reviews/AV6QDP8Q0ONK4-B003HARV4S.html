<meta name="summary" content="I OWN IT"></head><body><p>This is a movie I am willing to say, "I own." I had to watch it three times before I caught everything in it, and I still watch it whenever it comes on TV, just in case.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays the illusionist in rather a boring fashion. He is carried by the fantastic acting of Paul Giamatti, as the inspector and by a very strong script. Norton's clever dialouge also helps make the movie, as his words to the inspector have alternate or hidden meanings. Norton attempts to win his childhood sweetheart from the prince as she was torn away from him in his youth due to their class differences. This is a movie you must pay attention to and watch closely in order to get the full effect. No fast forwarding allowed. It was currently in the Wal-Mart $5.00 bin and used ones are even cheaper on Amazon. This one is a keeper.</p></body></html>

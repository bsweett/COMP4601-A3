<meta name="summary" content="Well, at least it's better than the original"></head><body><p>The original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7ZOL2">Clash of the Titans</a> is perhaps mostly remembered for its sheer corniness. This remake by the same name is certainly better and has amped up special effects. On the whole, I'd give it 3.5 stars. The movie does some things very well, such as the monsters. Medusa looks great and perfectly combines beauty and horror. Yet, I can't help but think that the directors wasted this opportunity to make a truly classic movie. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG977Y">Clash of the Titans</a> falls into the trap of many modern movies in packing nearly every scene with intense battles or special effects. The movie's pacing rarely slows down enough to develop the characters or expand its emotional range beyond pure adrenaline. Also, some characters seem out of place. Who exactly are the Jin? As it stands, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG977Y">Clash of the Titans</a> is certainly worth watching, but didn't manage to reach is full potential.</p></body></html>

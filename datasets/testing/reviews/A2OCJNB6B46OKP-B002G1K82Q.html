(Part 1 of 2)"></head><body><p>As a huge Beatles fan since the age of 5 seeing the trailer for this movie was a very big thing. Not that many people have the audacity to bring the Musical to the big screen anymore, especially if the story is not based on a broadway musical. 'Acorss The Universe' is the story of an English bloke named Jude (from Liverpool no surprise) heading to America in the 60s to find his estranged father. No sooner that he get there he is swept up into the whole revolution that was America at that time. A wild and fun loving guy named Max and his sheltered younger sister Lucy guide him through this crazy time through travel, drugs, politics and of course song.<br /><br />While the movie was creative and being a Beatles fan it is something to see, I felt that the movie was just a little overhyped. I felt there were plenty of unanswered questions due to plot holes. There wasn't enough character development. While the story was very well thought out I felt that the movie was more focused on the music leaving the plot very shallow. Yes it is true that the point of the movie was for the songs to tell the story, as a person that loves film I just don't like that concept. I like to get involved and think about the stories, not just get lost in a visual specticle. Still, the linking of Beatles knowledge and 1960's pop culture references was pretty much what kept me interested in sticking around from start to finish.<br /><br />Did I hate this movie...no I found it origional and entertaining. I loved the guest appreaences of faces like Bono and Eddie Izzard. I loved the refernces to alot of secondary Beatles songs. I just feel that it was a story that could have been developed so much more if the movie was not focused on the songs. I have seen many musicals in my days. 'The Music Man', 'The Sound Of Music' and oh hell 'South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut'. They are had songs driving the movie, but at the same time a fantastic story that made you love it when the credits rolled. Still any Beatles fan out there should take the time to see 'Across The Universe'. You will be glad you did.</p></body></html>

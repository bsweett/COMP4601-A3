<meta name="summary" content="The Murky Depths Above"></head><body><p>Based upon a Japanese film of similar name, DARK WATER stars Jennifer Connelly as Dahlia Williams, a recently divorced woman who is trying to make a new life for her and her daughter, Ceci (Areil Grade).  An ongoing custody battle with her ex-husband, Kyle (Dougray Scott) hasn't left Dahlia with much money, but she is able to find an inexpensive apartment on an island across from Manhattan.  The apartment is small and somewhat dingy, but the landlord Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) seems quite helpful, the building is close to the school, and it's in Dahlia's price range.  So she takes it.<br /><br />At first she doesn't pay attention to a small water stain on the ceiling of the bedroom. Then Dahlia notices that the stain grows larger and is dripping dark water.  Then Ceci finds a little girl's backpack on the roof of the building and later her schoolteacher informs Dahlia that Ceci has been speaking with an imaginary friend named Natasha.  The apartment makes strange noises and Dahlia thinks she sees strange kids running around on the abandoned floor above. Her migraines become more intense and she starts having more frequent nightmares about her own troubled childhood. Dahlia believes that it's all connected and investigates into the root cause of all the problems.<br /><br />DARK WATER was marketed in the U.S. as a horror movie. I'm not really sure why because the film isn't a horror movie.  It does have a gothic tone and is suspenseful, but that's about the only connections to the horror genre the film has.  The movie reminded me most of some of the suspense films of Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have about DARK WATER is that it moves at a very slow pace.  The slow pacing augments the gothic tone of the movie, but it also makes the movie very difficult to watch all the way through in one setting.  What I enjoyed most about the film was the actual story and the acting.  The lovely Jennifer Connelly is brilliant as ever and John C. Reilly does a great job as the landlord.<br /><br />If you can handle the slow pacing DARK WATER is an average suspense film that is particular fun to watch on a rainy day.</p></body></html>

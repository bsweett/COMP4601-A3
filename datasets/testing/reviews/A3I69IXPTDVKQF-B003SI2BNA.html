<meta name="summary" content="Tremendously Powerful Meeting Of Fear And Love, Drama And Darkness"></head><body><p>"Dark Water" is incredible, one of the greatest examples of the quiet/atmospheric branch of horror movies ever made.  A word of warning: this is not a movie to just plant oneself in front of and half pay attention to if you want to get anything out of it (actually, I feel no movie fits that description but it's particularly relevant here).  It starts slow and takes the time to build up, and one admittedly has to meet it at least part way to fully take in the rewards of this very powerful and very emotional horror drama.  If you spend too much time just waiting and wanting the scares to come in the early portions of the movie (they do come, but later on) you're liable to miss out on the subtle enigmatic ambiguities, the developing relationships and the intricate 'brick-by-brick' approach of the plot building.  Don't get me wrong, I love horror movies that go strong throttle from the get-go ("Dawn Of The Dead", "Freddy Vs. Jason", "Rawhead Rex", et. al.) but this is a very different aspect of the horror field we're seeing here, and one that's no less potent.  The slower pace may have hurt its chances at worldwide blockbuster status, as may have the fact that the dominant relationship in the movie is that of the loving, non-dysfunctional bond between a young mother and her little girl, but neither detract from "Dark Water"'s quality.<br /><br />  The mother, Dahlia (played by the incomparable Jennifer Connelly) and her little girl Ceci (adorably played by Ariel Gade) have fallen on hard times following the divorce of Dahlia and her rather arrogant and unlikeable ex-husband and end up moving into a new apartment building, a rather run-down place, where the apartment in which they end up is experiencing problems with significant water leakage, at first nothing more than another aspect of the building's general weak state of repair but later taking on much more sinister implications.  The source of the water seems to be the empty(?) apartment above their own, and Ceci seems to be developing a friendship with another child who may or may not really exist.<br /><br />Things, circumstances, and characters change as the movie progresses.  At times, the brand of intensity is similar to that in the brilliant "House Of Sand And Fog", Connelly's last movie before this one.  There are moments of lightness sprinkled throughout the dark, many of them involving the aforementioned mother-daughter relationship, and the acting throughout, right down to the smallest supporting players, is first rate.  Disturbing, often sad and tragic, frightening, and gloomy, "Dark Water" avoids being depressing through the liakability  of its leads, through the moments of beauty and compassion and courage, through the sheer quality of the movie and frankly through the bountiful' cute kid' appeal of Gade as little Ceci and the gorgeous beauty of Connelly as Dahlia.<br /><br />The ending (not to give anything away, but...) - I've seen, I don't know, it must be well over a thousand movies and I've never seen an ending even remotely like this.  I will say nothing of it except that it's extremely effective and eternally memorable; a must-witness.<br /><br />Outstanding; one of the year's best.</p></body></html>

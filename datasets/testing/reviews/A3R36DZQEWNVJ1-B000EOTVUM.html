<meta name="summary" content="Wolf Creek tries to deliver the goods but fails with predictability and not enough scare"></head><body><p>In Broome, Australia in 1999, two girls and one guy go on a road trip and they stop along the way in Wolf Creek where they take a gander at a large crater (pretty cool aerial shot of it by the way). Supposedly a metetor hit it (which is like 2 atomic bombs dropping). When they get back to the car, the girls notice that their watches arent working and then the car isnt working...so they are stuck there but later in the night they are helped out by a stranger, played by John Jarrett (Better Homes and Gardens, Next Of Kin), who tows their car back to his shop. One of the girls wakes up tied up and gagged. She then gets free and finds her friend being tortured by Jarret. They escaped and then they go back to look for their other friend and one of them finds out why this sicko killer does what he does. Predictable situations cloud this movie with only one uncomfortable scene (it's at the end where the guy who is kidnapped takes himself down from the wall because he's pinned to it) and there are some pretty good camera work. The Acting is ok but it turns into the typical screaming and hollering in any horror movie.  The movie it started out ok but then it ended. Inspired By True Events....when isnt it? Also starring Nathan Phillips (Australian Rules, Neighbours), Cassandra Magrath (Hotel de Love, Shock Jock) and Kestie Morassi (Darkness Falls, Strange Bedfellows). There was an Emu Creek, why didnt they just visit the Emu's instead of hiking 3 hours for the big crater?</p></body></html>

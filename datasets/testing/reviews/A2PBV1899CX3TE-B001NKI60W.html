Though it was also the name of a canned fish company, Abba made it their own, and became an international sensation with a catalogue of hits built on catchy hooks and a wall-of-sound made of up of multi-tracked harmonies from Agnetha and Anni-Frid.<br /><br />Two fans wanted to base a musical on Abba songs--stringing the tunes together with a little plot to give it a very slight pretext. The band was at first cold to the idea, but the fan/musical producers prevailed, and after many, many performances, and now a movie, Abba has come around.<br /><br />------------------<br />Sophie: [reading Donna's diary] We danced on the beach, kissed on the beach and dot, dot, dot.<br />=================================<br /><br />Mamma Mia! was wildly successful, but lots of critics took aim, some calling it the worst movie of the year. I think that Mamma Mia! appealed to an untapped older audience nostalgic for the days when Dancing Queen ruled the airwaves and the dance hall. I think it was more like a Fantasy Camp for actors who always secretly wanted to be rock stars, and also wanted a chance to get away to a luscious Greek Island. It is like singing Abba at a Karaoke bar--and what is the point of judging it on the basis of the singing? It is the fun factor that is paramount. The people were having so much fun making the movie that you can't help but be caught up in the festive mood. What does Meryl Streep have to prove as an actress? Did you want to see if she could master yet another accent, and emote flawlessly, as if it were her native tongue? Don't you think she could do that blindfolded in her sleep with one hand tied behind her back?<br /><br />----------------<br />Donna: And welcome to- to Sophie's dad. I have to tell you, he is here.<br />Sophie: I know, I invited him.<br />Donna: You couldn't have, I don't even know which one it is.<br />=====================================<br /><br />Meryl Streep's acting was bad, but it was fun to watch her let her hair down and just have fun. How often do you get to see Streep, master thespian that she is, act badly? Pierce Brosnan signed up on the strength of her name alone, without even reading the script. Was he disappointed that she didn't bring her "A" Game? No, he was relieved that his acting wouldn't have to be judged in comparison. It was bad enough that of the whole cast, he was judged the weakest singer.<br /><br />Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsg?rd were the three men from Donna Sheridan's past who might be Sophie's (Amanda Seyfried's) dad. Skarsg?rd was the token Swede, and I am only mentioning him at all since I wanted to make use of my Umlaut font set, but I was glad to have him there, as after all, Abba was a Swedish group. The three possible fathers were more than adequate to their roles.<br /><br />----------------<br />Donna: Wh-wh what are you all doing here?<br />Bill: I'm writing a travel piece.<br />Harry Bright: I- I'm on a spontaneous holiday.<br />Sam Carmichael: I-I-I I just dropped in to say... hi.<br />===============================<br /><br />The three woman, led by Streep, were really great. Here is some interesting background trivia. The women who wrote Mamma Mia based the character of Tanya on Mary Ann, a character played by Christine Baranski on Cybill Shepherd's eponymously titled sit com. No wonder Christine Baranski was perfectly cast as Tanya, and the catharsis is complete.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Tanya: [talking about Donna's money troubles and her life in general] Yeah, but are you being taken care of?<br />Donna: What do you mean?<br />Tanya: Are you getting any?<br />Donna: Oh, you mean...<br />[turns on the screw driver, making loud noises, then says to the screw driver:]<br />Donna: Down, boy.<br />===================================<br /><br />Julie Walters as Rosie was also a little show stealer.<br /><br />------------------------<br />Rosie: [to Tanya] Typical isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad and then three come along at once.<br />============================================<br /><br />So, if you want to pass judgment on a movie and fault it for bad singing, bad acting, and over or under exposed film, then by all means throw those rotten tomatoes. But if you want to have fun, fun, fun 'til your daddy takes your T-Bird away, then what are you waiting for?

<meta name="summary" content="A Message in the Madness"></head><body><p>This film is edgy and incredibly imperfect, it bounces around in time and begins where it ends but there is a method to the madness.<br /><br />In every life a stranger's actions may reflect our future at any given moment and this film brings together three lives and three families as no other. It begins with the ending, an unexplained moment that makes no sense and seems entirely insignificant until the end. We find a cynical almost self-loathing man in need of an organ transplant, he sits alone in a room waiting to die or be given life through another's death. Another core character is a busy mom who bakes a cake with her girls but hides her deepest secrets from her family. The driving force in the film is an ex-con who covers his anger by representing a born again Christian to the outside world. The film takes these main characters and twists and turns back and forth through time revealing the past and presenting glimpses of the future as it rolls slowly along. It is difficult to get through but worth the effort once all of the scenes are eventually tied together.<br /><br />The actors in this film deserved more attention for their roles. Sean Penn is the ailing professor and puts his all into the struggle of this man's life. Penn is perfect as the seriously conflicted man managing to always be flawless in such challenging roles. Naomi Watts is the seemingly happy young mother but soon changes face as tragedy disrupts her protected world and Watts decays into a different character. Watts is brilliant next to Penn and is not even close to suffocating in his turmoil; she brings her own agony right back and does it extremely well. Finally Benecio Del Toro is superb as the flawed ex-con trying to control his future by a false faith. Del Toro is anguish! He always brings something extra to his roles. Adding to the fantastic acting of these individuals is the way that the director filmed this movie. The actors are filmed in a gritty light that sticks in each and every facial imperfection and traces the tragedy of their lives. The actor's skin is sallow and almost gray, with dark circles under their eyes and grimy fingernails clasping cigarettes in most of the scenes. If you are looking for pretty this isn't it! But the filmmakers deepen the tragedy of the characters with this unique technique somehow.<br /><br />The message that extends from this gritty film is that our lives intersect with many others through a series of events and that one bad decision can off shoot into a million others. With all of the people we pass by unconsciously everyday it may make you wary or it may make you aware of the impact your life has in the world. The message is clear and the writer/director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, has managed to convey his worth to the world in an amazingly unique and profound way. The weight of this film is more than a few grams and Inarrito has carved himself a brilliant future.</p></body></html>

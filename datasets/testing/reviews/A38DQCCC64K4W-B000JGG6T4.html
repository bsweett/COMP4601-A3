<meta name="summary" content="One Of Tony Scott's Best Never Looked Better"></head><body><p>It's a little longer than it needed to be, but this story of a little girl kidnapped by some criminals in Mexico is still intense, beautiful to look at, and generally hard to ignore; Washington and Scott are in fine form, as the colorful 'washed' look of the film suits it perfectly. Christopher Walken is in fine form, as is Dakota Fanning; The relationship between Washington and Fanning is never overdone, but more on a realistic side. And when the s**t goes down for the final few acts of this movie, you can't help but root for Washington the whole way. Great scenery and color schemes help to make this something special to me. Very violent but seemed to fit the premise. On blu ray, it's pretty amazing.</p></body></html>

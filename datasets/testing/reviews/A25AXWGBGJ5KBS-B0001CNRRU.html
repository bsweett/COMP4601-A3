<meta name="summary" content="The best acted movie of 2003."></head><body><p>&quot;21 Grams&quot; is a movie of overwhelming power and drama, told in a compelling fashion by director Inarritu.<br />Much has been said about the kaleidoscopic, jigsaw puzzle-like storytelling technique used in this film, but it works flawlessly.<br />Briefly and reduced to absurdity, Sean Penn plays a man with a diseased heart, Naomi Watts plays a happy mother of two with a seriously dark past, and Benicio Del Toro plays a religious fanatic ex-con. I dare not tell you more, because one of the joys of this film is figuring it out the true sequence of events on your own.<br />These three strangers end up together (you know that from the beginning, given the way the story is told), but being only given snippets of information, in an artful, non-chronological and piece-meal manner, lends extraordinary suspense to the film; you feel guilty even pressing pause. We're talking Hitchcock levels of suspense here...you NEED to know how it's going to end.<p>&quot;Incendiary&quot; is an adjective often used to describe an acting performance; you will gasp at Naomi Watts here. I sat slack-jawed and fully amazed. I never knew she could do something like this, and she will surpass your every expectation.<p>Sean Penn gave the two best performances of the year, here and &quot;Mystic River&quot;. They're both career performances, in a career full of them. He's making a strong case for being our greatest living actor. Those who think I'm overstating the obvious, consider starting with Spicoli from &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, and then imagining roles in &quot;Falcon and The Snowman&quot;, &quot;Carlito's Way&quot;, &quot;Casualties of War&quot;, &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, &quot;At Close Range&quot;...and ending up in 2003 with those two films mentioned above. Few actors could match that range with that quality, for over two decades straight.<p>I was not prepared for this film. I was far better than I thought it was going to be. It's the type of movie you want every person who enjoys film and filmmaking to see. You will tell others about it. You will want to talk about it.<br />Set aside a night to watch this, I implore you. If youv'e read this far, this is the type of movie for you.</p></body></html>

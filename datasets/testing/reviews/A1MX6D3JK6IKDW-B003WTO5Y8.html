<meta name="summary" content="QUESTIONS / ANSWERS"></head><body><p>In a movie reviewed a million times, I have only questions. Who are the idiots who are forever saying that this movie is historical fact? What institutions did they escape from? How and who captured Dr. Lechter in the first place? As good as the movie is, am I the only person in the world who thinks both actors have done better work in other films? If Lechter is right about Crawford's sexual attraction to Starling, wouldn't he have had her around him at every opportunity? For my buck, I"m much more uneasy about "Buffalo Bill" than Lechter. You? Does anyone doubt that Lechter has his arch enemy for dinner? I"m still fuzzy about a killer who prefers rotund women and the significance of Chinese butterfly eggs. Explanation of these two parts of the puzzle? Finally, any truth to the rumor that this film is in the top 10 of all time in box office receipts? I say "no way".</p></body></html>

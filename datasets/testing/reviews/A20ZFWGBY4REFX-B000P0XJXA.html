<meta name="summary" content="Kilmer's great performance sparks this intelligent thriller!"></head><body><p>Not too long ago, I managed to check out "Spartan" at the theater. And, to me, I thought that the film was nothing short of amazing. "Spartan" had a great storyline, a powerful plot, and masterful direction by David Mamet ("Heist", "The Spanish Prisoner"). The performances of Val Kilmer ("Red Planet", "Top Gun"), Derek Luke ("Antwone Fisher", "Biker Boyz"), William H. Macy ("Jurassic Park III", "Magnolia"), Ed O'Neill ("Dutch", TV's "Married with Children"), and Kristen Bell ("Pootie Tang") were top-notch and flawless!<p>"Spartan" puts the focus on Robert Scott (Kilmer), a career military officer working in a highly secretive special operations force. Scott is a man hardened by years of brutal service, but is respected by his peers and elders in the world of espionage. When Scott is recruited to find Laura Newton (Bell), the daughter of a high-ranking official (more than likely, the daughter of the President of the United States), he is paired with novice Curtis (Luke), who becomes his protege. Working with a special task force comprised of presidential advisors, the Secret Service, FBI and CIA, Scott and Curtis stumble upon a sex slavery ring, which may have some connection to Laura's disappearance. As the story unfolds, the straightforward search-and-rescue mission becomes complicated by the political ambitions of those in high places. Like Stoddard (Macy), a political operative who may know more than he's telling about the clandestine circumstances surrounding the abduction of Laura. Scott and Curtis are on the brink of tracking Laura's whereabouts when the mission comes to an abrupt conclusion, with the media issuing reports of the girl's death. Scott returns to the quiet life of landowner in a rural location and awaits his next assignment in relative peace. But Curtis can't rest. In his naivete, he seeks out Scott to confide his belief that Laura is in fact alive. If she is, their continued unofficial investigation will put them, as well as Laura, at the center of a dangerous conspiracy that reaches the highest levels, even past the doors of the White House itself!<p>In conclusion, "Spartan" is a fine, superb, underrated thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat as well as to keep you guessing from heart-pounding beginning to breathtaking finish! With powerful performances by a stellar cast and masterful direction by David Mamet, "Spartan" is nothing short of a DVD must-own when it's released!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Makes so sense.  But it's pure entertainment and I loved it."></head><body><p>First of all, understand this is science fiction.  Second of all, understand that the plot is simple and silly.  And third of all, realize that this $125 million film has given work to hundreds of people in the special effects business.  <p> <p>Then sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.  And if it's in an air-conditioned theater on a hot summer day, you'll enjoy it even more.<p> <p>O.K., it's not great art.  And Dennis Quaid, cast as "the scientist who nobody listens to until it's too late" has been seen in better roles.  He's supposedly based in Washington DC and his 17-year old son, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is stuck in New York when the disaster hits.  It's a whopping disaster too.  The weather is going wacky.  A tornado is destroying Los Angeles.  And the "mother of all blizzards" is burying New York in a mountain of snow and ice.  The temperature is dropping at the rate of 10 degrees a second. Global warming has caused a new ice age and everyone in the northern part of the world is freezing to death.<p> <p>There's a whole bunch of people holed up in the New York Public library, most notably Jake Gyllenhaal and well as his girlfriend who needs some emergency medicine to save her.  There's the librarian who reluctantly understands that they need to burn the books in order to survive.  And then there is the homeless man and his dog who teaches the people how to put layers of paper inside their clothes in order to insulate themselves and keep warm.<p> <p>There's a global emergency and half the United States has to be evacuated into Mexico.  Of course the writers added humor and the audience got a chuckle watching Americans crossing the Rio Grande to get into Mexico illegally.  <p> <p>Anyway, Dennis Quaid decides to try to find his son in New York.  And so he decides to walk on snowshoes.  <p> <p>Of course this makes so sense.  But I didn't come to this film to see something that made sense.  I came to see the special effects.  <p> <p>But, curiously, something interesting happened.  Somewhere along the line I forgot to notice the special effects.  All I saw was the city I love being destroyed.  I couldn't help it.  There were tears dripping down my face. <p> <p>There's a happy ending of course.  All the main characters live.  The world will continue.  And everyone will be more aware of the dangers of global warming.<p> <p>And yes.  I do recommend this film.  Just know what you're in for before you walk into the theater.</p></body></html>

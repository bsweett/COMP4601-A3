Then a friend of mine seconded his opinion, claiming it was dreadful.  She mentioned that the 12 yr old boy she brought to the film thoroughly enjoyed it.  One of the readers of the NYTimes, a jr. high teacher, said he found the movie to be perfectly geared to a jr. high audience.<br /><br />So....I waited till it came to the dollar theater, not expecting a whole lot.  I think that expectations are important...I have found that if I expect a lot I'm often disappointed, and vice-versa.  So I offer this review saying that if you don't expect High Art, and are not bothered by politically incorrect homophobic jokes, you might like this.  (I also advise you to read the review here by Mark Eremite, which I think is quite intelligent.)<br /><br />So, expecting not-much, I bought my very cheap ticket and joined the crowd at the Sat. afternoon show at the cheapest theater in town.  I actually enjoyed it!  Not a huge amount---but my attention never left the screen from beginning to end.  With the exception of a really tacky episode with a gay cop, there's nothing really offensive.  And that says a lot for movies these days.<br /><br />I think that the success of the film (and it was a huge box office smash) is due to the very capable and attractive cast.  John Travolta is strong and charismatic.  While I wouldn't call him exactly handsome, he certainly is hunky and not bad to look at. He doesn't seem to take the role terribly seriously but maybe that's ok.  Martin Lawrence is very funny and endearing.  His facial expressions are terrific and he excudes a sweet vulnerability as the hen pecked plumber.<br /><br />William H. Macy, a fine actor, brings a touch of class to what could have been a very dopey character--the computer nerd.  He embues this girl-shy guy with an innocence and simplicity that is really touching.  Even with his rumpled face and tendancy to self-destruct, he wins the prettiest girl in town, which I found truly touching.<br /><br />Tim Allen's performance, as the dentist, was the most lack-luster, in my opinion.  He does have a nice moment near the end, when confronting the "real" bikers, telling them that they, are really the posers.  That won points for me.<br /><br />The big surprise is the cameo appeaance of the archetypal film bad-biker, Peter Fonda!  He is appropriately adorable with his grey curls under his bandana, eclipsing all of the other bikers, and wannabes with his presence.  A nice touch, for those of us who remember him cruising through the same New Mexico territory in Easy Rider.<br /><br />Under all the silliness, there are some nice lessons and the good guys really do win out.  Just read the reviews here, see who you most resonate with, and make that your index of how much you'll like this movie.</p></body></html>

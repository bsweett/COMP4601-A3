<meta name="summary" content="A fast paced, action packed and witty movie"></head><body><p>This is a highly entertaining movie - the 2 hours at the cinema just flew away. On the movie, Brad Pitt and Anglina Jolie looked cool, intelligent and made for each other. The music score was as exciting as the action quickenened the heartbeat. The director(Bourne Identity) succeeded to maintain the pace and tension throughout the movie. He was clever to make full use of Angelina's strengths - determined look and physical prowess built in Lara Croft movies. Brad Pitt had excellent lines and a big heart.<br /><br />What makes this movie better than other summer blockbusters is the focus on the romance part and the attention to fine details in the script - well-written dialogues, timely gags, looks exchanged. There is chemistry between Brad and Angelina.<br /><br />The best scene was when Mr. and Mrs. Smith, both professional killers for different companies, were at the dinner table figuring out whether the other one was the rival player and how much the other knew already. At the same time, they were wary of all sorts of potential dangers - sharp words, knives, poison, guns, car chase etc.  Watch for the crucial moment when Brad Pitt gave a final test to Angelina and she fell for it. From then on, they were at each other's throat and their relationship changed drastically - only for the better as their love for each other was rekindled.<br /><br />Differences between men and women were implicated in the movie. Consider how Mr. and Mrs. Smith work, Jane's sorority vs John's pair, how Jane outsmarted John in the search of the house. Not to mention the head count between Jane and John. The marriage counsel meeting at the beginning and at the end of the movie was a delightful twist.<br /><br />A movie with excellent lines, laughs and action. I walked out of the cinema with anticpations greatly exceeded. Love to watch it again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable, Watchable, Scarey Unrated Edition"></head><body><p>Once again, the Unrated edition beats the other editions.<br />The Fog itself behaves in the same "against the wind" manner it did in the 1979 version.<br />A larger budget, excellent FX, make this film a blast to watch. The audio is great on a 5.1, and adds to the chills.<br />The deleted scenes in the extras are interesting, and there is no clear reason why some very spooky moments are deleted.<br />The features show a lot of the behind the scenes work, as well as the FX magic. The commentary is sort of enlightening, but it seems like the director is as at a loss as to why the good scenes were chopped as is others. The Unrated edition adds back some superb work. The end result is a good story, well executed.<br />Even after Multiple Viewings, my original reason for getting this film was seeing the clip of Selma Blair ( HellBoy), still stands as  the mosty outstanding reason to get this film; even so, the film has some great moments with the exchanges with  Dan the Weather Man, the signature rapping on the door, and the extremely well done extension of the background story to the Wraiths in the fog, as well as the History of the Town.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></body></html>

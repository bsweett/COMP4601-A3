He befriends a girl, and together they try to understand the meaning of a mechanical man left behind by the boy's father upon his death. Martin Scorsese has long been a great storyteller and he has now established himself as a master of the 3D effect. The visuals in this film are remarkable, without being a blatant attempt at cashing in on the 3D fad. With good acting all around, the performance that stands out is that of Chloe Moretz, one of the best young actresses in Hollywood. Her subtle expressions throughout add to the charm of this film. The film's intricate storyline may not keep younger children entertained for two hours, but for older kids and adults Hugo is a magical journey of discovery and visual wonders.</p></body></html>

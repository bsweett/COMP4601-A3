<meta name="summary" content="Clooney is not just a movie star. He has become a first class"></head><body><p>dramatic actor. Michael Clayton is not so much a great movie as it is an award worthy performance by George Clooney & Tom Wilkerson. George Clooney plays an attorney (Clayton) known as a fixer. He is brought in  late to clean up cases that have gone south. He was a fine litigator, but never got his chance. Tom Wilkerson is a top flight litigator who cracks up & changes sides. It is Clooney's job to clean up the mess. They both work for a morally bankrupt law firm hired to defend a corrupt chemical company. Key moments of the movie take place in Milwaukee & Wisconsin farm country. They both are turned by a crisis of conscience & somebody tries to kill them both in separate incidents. Not a particularly brillant plot. But the acting is. This movie should be seen because it is good & entertaining, but also for the transcendent acting.</p></body></html>

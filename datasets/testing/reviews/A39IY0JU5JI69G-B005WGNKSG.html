<meta name="summary" content="Better than the book"></head><body><p>This is one of the few instances in which I can say that the film was better than the book.  Or, more accurately, less bad than the book.  I read the book (actually listened to the unabridged audio version) a year ago while I commuted.  I hated it but kept on till the end just to pass the miles.  I never intended to see either of the two film versions.<br /><br />However, in the past year I saw the lead actor, Michael Nyquist in two other Swedish films and loved him...so when I saw that he was portraying Blomquist I thought I'd take a peek.  In my opinion he helped the film a lot by humanizing the lead character.  In the book, Blomquist was portrayed as a super-stud, who was so irrestable to women that many of them took their clothes off in his presence.  (I chalk this up to fantasizing on behalf of the writer who based Blomquist on himself.)  In the film Nyquist is much warmer, sweeter, more sensitive and actually made me care about him...enough to keep on watching.<br /><br />I liked the woman who played Lizbeth Salander, too, although I didn't relate to her at all in the book.  In the book, she's a one dimensional cartoon but in the film she manages to show some warmth and vulnerability behind the Goth and leather getup.  The original version of the film was Men who Hate Women and I think the change is much better.  This really is Lizbeth's film; she's the one we will remember.<br /><br />Other improvements:  some of Blomquist's sexual encounters with various women are left out, notably that with Berger, his boss at the magazine.  That was a relief!  Somehow the sexual assaults and various other crimes were less horrific here, although the film doesn't spare the sights.  Maybe it was because I knew what was coming, but also I think the book goes into much more details.<br /><br />I liked the relationwhip between Blomquist and Salander; I thought the film got it just right.  In the book it's much more about Berger, which is confusing.<br /><br />The story, itself, has possibilities.  Unfortunately much of it is beyond belief and way over the top in sensational garbage.  I liked the few scenes of rural Sweden.<br /><br />Mostly I think the book and film are way, way, over rated and I would not recommend either.</p></body></html>

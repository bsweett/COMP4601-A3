<meta name="summary" content="Throw Away Your Video Tape: Get The DVD"></head><body><p>DVD extras are all very well, but they are meaningless without the movie itself--and here Disney's remastered, restored, and digitalized SNOW WHITE lives up to every bit of the press it has received.  Even now, some seventy years after it was first seen, this simple version of the famous Grimm fairy-tale can still cast a spell through storytelling pure and simple.  And the DVD formatted film is astonishingly beautiful--brilliantly colored--incredibly clear--so beautiful that no matter how often you may have seen the film in the past you will feel that you now see it for the first time.<p>The extras are enough to fill out a second disk and include everything from background art to timelines to trivia games.  Some of it is very interesting indeed; some of it I found rather tedious.  But... so what?  The important thing, the thing you're actually buying the DVD for, is SNOW WHITE, right? And with this DVD release, she remains the fairest in the land.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What Lies In THE FOG?"></head><body><p>After the smash success of his 1978 horror/suspense classic HALLOWEEN, director John Carpenter, along with his producer Debra Hill, instead of exploiting that film's success with a sequel (for the time being, anyway), decided to make a ghost story.  The result, the 1980 thriller THE FOG, was almost certainly the first really good horror film of the Eighties, one that for the most part was otherwise dominated by HALLOWEEN-inspired slasher movies.<p>Like Hitchcock's THE BIRDS and Spielberg's JAWS, THE FOG is set in a seaside community.  This time, it's Antonio Bay, on the coast of Northern California, near Point Reyes.  The community is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary of existence, and a lot of people are in attendance.  But, in the film's prologue, as an old man of the sea (John Houseman) relates it to some kids, we learn that a crew of leper pirates had been led to a watery grave while being guided by a lighthouse beacon onshore shining through a very thick fog bank.  Now, these same pirates are about to take their revenge on the people and visitors of Antonio Bay, shrouded by that very same thick blanket of fog that sent them to their doom a century before.<p>As with HALLOWEEN, Carpenter has sought to limit the violence and gore that was starting to become part-and-parcel of most commercial horror films of the time.  Instead, he opts for a combination of supernatural horror, mystery, and suspense, as Antonio Bay's townsfolk find themselves at the mercy of a past they thought they had put behind them.  And for this, Carpenter has assembled a tresure trove of actors--Jamie Lee Curtis (HALLOWEEN); her real-life mother Janet Leigh (PSYCHO); Hal Holbrook (ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN); Charles Cyphers; and Nancy Loomis, to name just a few.  Although some plot holes do lessen the experience somewhat, THE FOG still succeeds as an atmospheric thriller, largely thanks to Carpenter's own piano-dominated music score, the eerie fog effects, and Dean Cundey's superb cinematography.<p>Only a handful of horror movies from this point on would ever really be considered classic material.  THE FOG is admittedly slightly imperfect, but in comparison to much of the dreck that followed in the 1980s, it is very much a classic nevertheless.</p></body></html>

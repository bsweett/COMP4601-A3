<meta name="summary" content="One of boxing's greatest stories comes to the big screen"></head><body><p>This is one of those real life stories that truly is almost too good to be true, a true story that out-rocks ROCKY, with a far more likeable central character.  The tale is such a superb one that one would imagine it impossible to botch, though Ron Howard is one of the few directors capable of doing precisely that.  Luckily, Howard, despite some efforts throughout the film (of this more below), does not manage to ruin the movie, though in the end it is more accurate to say that it succeeds despite and not because of his contributions.<br /><br />I would cite three main reasons the film manages to succeed:<br /><br />1) The basic story generated by Jim Braddock himself.  His improbable comeback at the height of the Depression to win the world heavyweight championship after injuries had caused him to leave boxing to work on the shipping docks in New Jersey, when he could find work at all.  His plight would force him to go on relief at one point.  Everything would change, however, when he was offered a one-time opportunity to fight a leading contender, whose opponent had been forced to withdraw at the last second.  For Braddock, it was an opportunity to get some cash to keep his family's head above water, but when he improbably defeated the contender, he unexpectedly found himself on the comeback trail.  As any boxing fan knows, Braddock went on to defeat two other boxers in an elimination sequence for a chance to take on heavyweight champion Max Baer.  Despite the odds, Braddock went on to defeat the heavily favored Baer, who gained a reputation as one of the most savage brawlers in boxing history, though he also has a reputation for not being one of the most skilled boxers.  My favorite moment in the telling of Braddock's amazing story might be during the interview before the title bout, when he explained that unlike the first half of his career, he now had a reason to fight:  "Milk."<br /><br />2) The performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, who I have found to be two of the most consistently interesting actors of the past half decade.  Crowe's offscreen antics sometimes obscure a massive onscreen talent.  There have been times when I have thought him to be the finest screen actor of his generation, and this performance has done nothing to lower him in my estimation.  Giamatti, who plays Braddock's manager, gained great notoriety in the widespread outrage expressed when he failed to gain an Academy Award nomination either for his amazing performances of the past two years, AMERICAN SPLENDOR and SIDEWAYS.  There is an effortless intelligence in his performances that mask just how gifted he is.  There is no actor I would rather see in a movie than Giamatti, and for a while I feared his unusual appearance might keep him from the kind of roles he deserves, but luckily Hollywood seems to have recognized just how extraordinary he is, and he unexpectedly emerged as an in-demand leading man.  He will next year star in M. Night Shyamalan's next film LADY IN THE WATER.  Though there are many other excellent performances in the film, these two provide most of the reasons for watching it.  Although I'm a big Ren&eacute;e Zellweger fan, her role simply wasn't as memorable as many of her other roles.<br /><br />3) The fight sequences.  Although they do not rival the boxing action in RAGING BULL, which is likely to serve as the gold standard for some time to come, they equal or surpass anything else, and vastly surpass the absurd fight scenes in the ROCKY films.<br /><br />Still, there were some things that infuriated me in the film, primarily two.  First, Ron Howard was guilty of shameless attempted manipulation of the viewers.  What I dislike about Howard (though I confess in interviews he seems like a nice enough fella) is the way he completely disrespects the intelligence of his viewers.  He plays tricks on the audience, usually telegraphing his punches like a bad boxer.  There are a host of instances of this in the film, but I will cite only two.  First, at one point in the film Zellweger's character is tearing wood from a billboard in order to have some firewood.  In the background we see a woman running after a man, begging him not to leave her, presumably a husband who has given up the struggle to keep his family together during the Depression.  Later, under trying circumstances, Russell Crowe leaves his family's miserable apartment, and Howard frames it all so as to attempt to make us believe that she is afraid that he is leaving like the man we saw earlier.  Of course he isn't, but this is the kind of cheap manipulation that only a hack director would engage in.  The second example I would point to comes later in the film when the possibility of Max Baer killing Braddock is exaggerated to utterly ridiculous levels.  Howard isn't content for Braddock to be an underdog:  he must be in danger of dying as well!  The historical record simply doesn't support such fears, and if we ask why it appears in the film, the only answer is:  Howard is trying to make us feel a threat that didn't exist so as to further manipulate our emotions.  This is just lousy filmmaking.  I should add briefly that the photography was often sub par.  There were a lot of perplexing transition shots that simply didn't do any work, where a camera would focus for utterly no reason on, say, an iron bar, and then pull back and pan over to others.  Why?  It was if someone said, "Well, we have to get this shot started, so we'll do THIS," without any clear understanding of why.  Also, there was a lot of unsteady camerawork, which is odd in the age of the Steadicam.  Directors and cinematographers will often use a hand held camera to engender a feeling of disease and vulnerability or disorientation, but it appeared at times in this one (and not just in fight scenes) with no apparent reason.<br /><br />I was also highly disturbed by some of the attitudes expressed in the film about some of the victims of the Depression.  At one point, for instance, Braddock applies for relief to feed his family, and the woman behind the counter, with an air of moral disapproval, says, "I never expected to see you here," as if he were guilty of some ethical failure.  I found her attitude to be inexplicable.  At a time when a quarter of the workforce was unemployed, why would anyone be the object of anything except sympathy and compassion?<br /><br />Still, problems like this does not in the end keep this from being a great story.  It remains to this day one of boxing's greatest fairytales.  Who needs ROCKY when you have Jim Braddock instead?<br /><br />Trivia:  A sequence in the film shows a boxing match between Max Baer and Primo Carnera.  The latter was in his day the largest boxer ever seen, at around 6'5, 260.  His career was more or less the basis for the film THE HARDER THEY FALL, which was notable for being Humphrey Bogart's last film before succumbing to throat cancer.  Interestingly, Max Baer has a significant role in the film.  Baer's son, Max Jr., would later achieve fame playing Jethro Bodine in TV's THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES.</p></body></html>

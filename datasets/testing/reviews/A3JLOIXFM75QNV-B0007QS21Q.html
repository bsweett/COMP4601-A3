<meta name="summary" content="An interesting premise"></head><body><p>This movie was unique and entertaining. I know the concept of A.I. is not new, but I like how it was realised in this film. This is by no means a great movie or a real important one, but it was fairly enjoyable and basically what you would call a 'popcorn flick', though a decent one. Will Smith plays the same exact character in every movie so I can't really rate him on his acting skills in this film, but it was at least bearable. The robots in the film were pretty neat, as were the rest of the effects. So, while not completely innovative, it is definitetly watchable.</p></body></html>

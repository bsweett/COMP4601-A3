<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>Definitely a great movie, Ocean's Eleven, brings to the screen the story of a recently released bank robber who plans to rob three Las Vegas casinos in one go.  Things become a bit more complicated when the team he has set up to carry out the heist finds out that his ex-wife is the casinos' owner's current girlfriend...<br /><br />George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few laughs.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Ocean's Eleven is a movie worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!  It is definitely a keeper! 4? Stars</p></body></html>

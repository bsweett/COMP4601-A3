"Transporter 2" is also patently ridiculous, but this time director Louis Leterrier (who did not direct the original) manages to keep the movie flowing and it's transferable fun manages to overpower the moments that lead our rational brain to say "What the . . ".<br /><br />Once again, Jason Statham is Frank Martin, a 'Transporter', who moves a customer's valuables from one location to another. He asks no questions about his cargo, keeping to a code that allows him professional detachment. Frank has taken up a temporary job to help out a friend by transporting the son of a U.S. Senator (Mathew Modine). Frank has taken a liking to the boy (Hunter Clary), while his mother, Audrey (Amber Valletta), has taken a liking to Frank. In the midst of this, an international thief for hire, Gianni (Alessandro Gassman), assisted by his borderline dominatrix associate, Lola (Kate Nauta), have kidnapped the son, Jack, with the intention of holding him for ransom, and also making it appear that Frank had a hand in it at the same time. Frank escapes the kidnappers, only to start to believe that there is more to the kidnapping than meets the eye.<br /><br />"Transporter 2" is one of those films that should come with the warning label to check your brain at the door. Lots of things happen in "Transporter 2" that are outside the boundaries of reality. Cars defy gravity, human beings perform incredible stunts and survive and people are often in the right place at the right time. Yet, the film has a strong charm that is hard to ignore. A lot comes from the presence of Jason Statham. He is all business as Frank Martin, and he cements the film with his no-nonsense attitude. Statham is the epitome of cool in this film, and that is just what it needs. We can't not help but root for this man at the center of the film, and our interest in seeing him pull himself out of his scrapes is at times just plain lifting. Alessandro Gassman has just the right amount of boldness to be fun as the villain and Kate Nauta seems to be channeling a punk rock superstar as a deadly, but sexy assassin.<br /><br />The film's action, while borderline impossible, is well-staged. Unlike many recent action films that over-edit their action, director Leterrier keeps everything clear and the running. The fight scenes, choreographed by fight-master, Corey Yuen, are as good as anything in recent martial-arts action movies, with a lean towards slightly more realism than, say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00030590I">Hero</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXR4">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>.<br /><br />If you are looking for some entertaining action then this is it, just don't believe everything you see.</p></body></html>

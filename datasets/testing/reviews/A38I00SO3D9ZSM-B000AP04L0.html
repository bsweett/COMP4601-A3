<meta name="summary" content="Umm, I'm gonna need you to go ahead and watch this movie. 'Kay?"></head><body><p>Office Space is a brilliant parody of life in corporate America.  While funny, the movie conveys the soullessness of commuting to work, putting in 8-10 hour days doing tasks you hate for a boss you hate even more, only to have to wake up the next day -- sometimes on weekends -- and do it all over again.  Even though it's clearly a comedy, Office Space has caused me to stop and consider (more than once) how I want to spend my work days.<br /><br />The comedy is brilliant.  There aren't too many movie scenes funnier than Peter, Michael and Samir exacting their revenge on a bothersome piece of office equipment.  The rest of the movie hums along at a great clip, lampooning the sameness of office and service industry job environments.<br /><br />The humor is a bit raw in spots.  If you are concerned about language, Office Space has its fair share of "F-bombs". Unlike some movies that need raunch to carry them, Office Space would be funny as a PG flick.<br /><br />Office Space is one of the best comedies of the last decade. Watch it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A perfect mixture of so many classic horror movies.."></head><body><p>..but with a Rob Zombie twist. Take &quot;Texas chainsaw massacre&quot;, &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &amp; &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; put them in a blender and blend well. The movie is hypnotic and twisted, funny, spooky, psychotic, stylish, inventive, and over all insane. A group of nerdy teens (who appear to be near 30 in real life) stop off at a wacky gas station / haunted novelty store. Big mistake! After the psychotic clown who runs the place gives them a map, they pick up a strange female hitchhiker. They take her home and meet her estranged family. If their nightmare hasn't begun, it's about to. From here on out they are abused, tortured and much more. &quot;HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES&quot; is what you might expect from goth rocker Rob Zombie. I mean that in a good way, you get lots of humor in between the scares and thrills.</p></body></html>

But, curiosity got the better of me, that, and so many misleading/glowing reviews posted here.  I just had to see what the fuss was all about.<br />I guess I should have read the negative reviews first.<br />All I can add is that I didn't absolutely hate it, but I saw nothing of real merit either.  It didn't engage me on any level.  I found it cold and detached from start to finish.  Everything about it was euphuistic: the grandiose score that never felt appropriate to the matter at hand, the mismatched acting styles that gave the BIG secret away, the intrusion of too many flashbacks (misleading clues), the dead slow pacing.....  Not to mention having to watch DiCaprio scowl/squint and misplace his accent for 137 minutes!<br />On an amusing note, the very qualities that people raved about were the very qualities that irritated me.  I found them more gimmicky than artistic.  Which brings this down to a matter of taste.  I can guarantee you'll either love it or hate it, or like me, not be moved to have any deep feelings for it.<br />I will add that I'm not sorry I watched it and didn't feel it was a waste of my time.  But, I have absolutely no interest in watching it again.  Not a keeper.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="one of the best movies ever"></head><body><p>Disclaimer first: if you are cheching this review for summary of script, you've come to the wrong place. I deal in impressions, not story-revealing.<br /><br />I saw it at opening evening, and it was a premiere sponsored by UNICEF. So the movie began with a long advertisement for UNICEF and UNHCR. Which is ridiculous, cuz if you have ever been to any of the conflict zones you KNOW that:<br /><br />1) UN staff mainly just take care of their safety and collection of danger pay<br /><br />2) UN staff (mission personnel and military involved in "peace keeping missions") are known for all sorts of misbehavior, from smuggling to raping children.<br /><br />Now that we have put that aside, let's go to the movie:<br /><br />First think that stroke me was the realism of the movie. Thanks to the multifaceted story, brilliant acting and excellent camera/ editing.<br /><br />The movie sucks you right in. I was jumping in the seat moaning "run run!!", I cried several times in the movie, I was shocked to see what happens in this "civilized" world we live in, I was embarassed to be complaining about "a bad day at work" or "dissatisfaction with life in general" I sometimes feel, I was happy to be born NOT in Africa (thou some might think Croatia is not THAT much better), I made a decision NEVER to buy another diamond, I was appaled at world business and all value being lost and forgotten apart from $$$.<br /><br />And that was one of the aims of this film, to make us reflect and adjust our behavior, and do our little thing to make world a better place.<br /><br />To this point, Connely says to DiCaprio "good things are done every day. just not by you". In the end, they both do good things. So can all of us.<br /><br />Kudos to casting director in this film. Thou I don't really like DiCaprio, he IS an excellent actor and he proves it from one movie to the next. In this one, his "Rhodesian" accent, the whole role of white boy in Africa /traumatized mercenary was compelling.<br /><br />Connelly in one of her better performances.<br /><br />Last but not least, Hounsou and Vosloo (oh he ages so good!).<br /><br />Cannot praise this film enough.<br /><br />Sorry about the long anti-UN rambling. Croatia has had its experience with them, so I kindda know what I am talking about..</p></body></html>

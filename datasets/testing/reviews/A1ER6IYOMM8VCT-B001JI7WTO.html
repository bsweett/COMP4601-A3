SORRY WRONG MOVIE!"></head><body><p>This remake is really disappointing and doesn't even come close to capturing the wonder of the original. The writers aimed this movie at 5 and 6 year old kids, but I think even they would be bored to tears as the action doesn't start until two thirds of the film has elapsed! Even when the film gets going.....so to speak, it's so tame and ridiculous that you would be much better off watching a classic like 'Pinocchio' or even the Saturday morning TV show 'Land Of The Lost' for more drama!<br /><br />I like Brendan Frasier, but he has made some extremely bad film choices over the years, hey I know....who can argue with a couple of million dollars to do this stuff?. Right?....... I'd probably do it too!<br /><br />In short, the CGI is unconvincing, the film is beyond juvenile and the story is really stupid and boring, it even seemed long for it's 85 minute running time and 10 minutes of that are opening and closing credits. I like the cast, but even they can't save this one from falling into a bottomless pit!</p></body></html>

Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) immigrated to Brighton Beach from the Ukraine with his family in the 1970s, where he had the revelation, after witnessing a mob hit in a restaurant, that, just as people will always have to eat, they will always have to kill. After selling guns to local mobsters for a while, he realizes, "The real money is in actual wars. Between countries." Shunned by the big-time arms dealers who operated with the CIA's blessing during the Cold War, Yuri turns to the gray market with his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) in tow. Idealistic Interpol Agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) becomes his persistent pursuer.<br /><br />"Lord of War" is told in biographical fashion, with Yuri delivering a biting, witty voiceover narration about his adventures in the arms trade throughout the film. The narration is smart, ironic, and funny. But it is delivered with droning lethargy by a self-loathing, vaguely regretful Yuri. This exemplifies "Lord of War"'s fatal flaw. Writer/director Andrew Niccol doesn't like his protagonist, hates guns, and probably disdains political violence in general. What's worse, Yuri is telling the story, so his own angsty, guilt-ridden delivery reflects his director's bias. Imagine reading a novel that is narrated in the first person by someone who can't stand himself. You will have a pretty good idea of what it's like to watch this film. Yuri is an interesting character who has a provocative story to tell. But he tells it with bored detachment, acute self-loathing, and without a trace of the salesman's vigor and sheer nerve that it took to sell weapons to the world's scariest war-mongers. Arms dealers are not, in reality, burdened by excessive guilt. Yuri enjoys his business, and he's good at it. Yet he refuses to act like it.<br /><br />"Lord of War" is ultimately critical of the arms trade. That's fine, but Andrew Niccol allowed his socio-political agenda to hamper his strengths. He wrote a smart, funny narration and then was afraid to let us laugh at it. The arms dealers and their ultra-violent clients are absurdly comical, but the film tries to shame us out of laughing at them. One minute, Yuri's commentary struck me as hilarious; the next minute I am being told that guns and killing is a very grave matter that only immoral people would make light of. "Lord of War" goes back and forth like this, constantly undermining itself. I commend actor Eamonn Walker for playing bloodthirsty Liberian President Andr&eacute; Baptiste, apparently based on deposed President Charles Taylor, with such gleeful viciousness that I couldn't help laughing at him. He seemed to understand that Baptiste was nuts but also completely ridiculous.  I like "Lord of War"'s script a lot. But it needed a more energetic lead performance and a director who was willing to make an all-out black comedy. People would get the message that the arms trade is unethical even if Yuri liked his job and relished his accomplishments. There was no need to emasculate the guy and bore the audience.</p></body></html>

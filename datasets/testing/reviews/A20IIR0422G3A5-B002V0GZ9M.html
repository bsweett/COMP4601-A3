And, in a strange way, this movie is as unusual as a romantic comedy as `Speed' was as an action movie, since both movies are based on unusual premises.<br /><br />The assumption, no surprise to anyone who has seen the trailer, is that the Bullock (Kate Foster, a doctor fresh out of residency) and Reeves (Alex Wyler, a building contract supervisor) characters both occupy the same house set upon stilts just off the shore of a small lake somewhere within easy driving distance of Chicago, except that Wyler occupies it in 2004 and Forster occupies it in 2006. The two communicate across this span of two years by leaving letters in the lake house's mailbox. And, the characters realize this little temporal anomaly quickly, about 20 minutes into the movie. What the trailer doesn't reveal (but which does not do much to give things away) is the fact that this lake house was originally built by Wyler's father, a famous architect, played by Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />The story is so simple and the characters are so few, I am hard pressed to find interesting things about the film without giving away a major part of the plot. One thing I can say is that the time travel aspect of the time shift premise is so subdued, one gets absolutely no sense this is remotely like any `science fiction' or even `Twilight Zone' type of story. It is far more like some Cary Grant romantic story from the 1940s or 1930s, where two characters are supposed to meet at the top of the Empire State Building, but one of the two characters never shows up.<br /><br />One thing the time travel premise does do is eliminate any sense that this is a `romantic comedy'. There are some light-hearted moments, but it is not really much more amusing than `Love Story' or `The Paper Chase'. It is certainly not in the same comedy class as `The Wedding Crashers' or `The Breakup'. Another thing the time travel scenario does is make your head hurt when you try to work out the classic time travel paradoxes, when the two characters do meet in circumstances where the later character, Forster (Bullock) encounters the earlier character, Wyler (Reeves) and Forster is not aware of the cross-temporal communication, since it hasn't happened (for her) yet. Again, fortunately, the time travel hypothesis is well downplayed you hardly notice the anomalies.<br /><br />One thing for sure is that this movie `works' as a romantic story. By the time we are halfway through the flick, we really want them to get together and are frustrated when they can't seem to figure out the obvious solution to the problem and actually get together. When they do set a plan in motion, we are genuinely distressed when it doesn't work out. Even more distressing is the suspicion of why the meeting did not work out.<br /><br />The side stories involving Wyler's father and brother and Forster's job and boyfriend are lightly done, just enough to distract us for a bit from the main story line without taking on too much substance and stealing from the romance.<br /><br />One of the more interesting little conceits is the fact that the two main characters end up adopting the same stray dog, who then succeeds in occupying scenes in both 2004 and 2006. The curious thing is that said dog doesn't appear in the final scene... I guess that would have been stretching the old space-time continuum just a bit too far! I'm also just a tad disappointed that there is no hint of explanation for why these two people should find themselves in this situation at these particular times, but then we would start getting into `Twilight Zone' territory, and there is really no need to go there. It contributes nothing to the love story.<br /><br />So, it would have been nice to have a director's or writer's voice-over commentary to give us some of this stuff, but there is none, reducing somewhat the rewatchability of the flick. But, if you need a good date movie, this one is a winner.<br /><br />Note that I strongly suspect the widescreen version is highly recommended here. I saw the 'full screen' version, and definitely sensed I was missing some things.</p></body></html>

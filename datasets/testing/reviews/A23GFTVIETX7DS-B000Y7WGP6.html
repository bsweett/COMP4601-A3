<meta name="summary" content=""We'll Kill Them All""></head><body><p>The powerful history of the United States' involvement in the Saudi Arabia flashes on the screen before the opening credits, creating a direct line from the past to the present day antagonism, and these moments are  the most affecting ones of this political thriller.  Jamie Foxx plays an FBI agent in charge of a small band of agents (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Cris Cooper) investigating, without State Department approval, a Saudi bombing which has cost the lives of one of their friends and hundreds of civilians.  During the investigation, they are watched over by Saudi policeman, Faris Al Ghazi (Ashrof Barhom), a man assigned to control their every move in the spirit of protection.  Of course, this being a Hollywood thriller set in Saudi Arabia, the Americans take matters into their own hands to overcome bureaucracy and corruption and to pursue the villains.<br /><br />Barhom plays his character with real humanity, and he steals every scene with his no-nonsense approach, tinged with idealism and hope for real justice.  The Americans all do competent acting jobs, although their roles seem too predictable given the plot.  The chase scenes are heart-stopping and somewhat over-the-top, but they keep this fast-paced flick moving from first moments to last.  The message driven home, that we are two peoples fighting and corrupting future generations, is laid over-the-top of what is an essentially go-blow-up-the-bad-guys plot. Nuances such as diplomacy, culture, and history are quickly lost in the gunfire.<br /><br />Certainly, this film entertains the way the best in the genre does; however, it tries too hard at times and not hard enough at others.  I recommend this for a one-time viewing.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></body></html>

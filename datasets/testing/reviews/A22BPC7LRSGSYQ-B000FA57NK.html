Apollo 13 (1995) is a great cinematic achievement from director Ron Howard.  It really captures the essence of what happened with Apollo 13 in April 1970.  One of the few failed expeditions in the history of the U.S. space program, it reminds one of how dangerous space travel is and how things can go wrong.  Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Kathleen Quinlan, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinese, and Ed Harris star in this movie.  Quinlan was nominated for an Academy Award for her great performance.<br /><br />The musical score by James Horner is great.  The movie also contains popular songs from the time period.<br /><br />All right thinking Americans should salute Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (the other half of the Apollo 11 mission and the second man to walk on the moon) for their bravery and for paving the way to the future of space exploration.  Now the U.S. is exploring Mars with its rover called Curiosity.  One day the U.S. will take the next step when it comes to Mars.<br /><br />Overall, Apollo 13 is an entertaining movie that I highly recommend.  In my opinion, it was the best movie of 1995.</p></body></html>

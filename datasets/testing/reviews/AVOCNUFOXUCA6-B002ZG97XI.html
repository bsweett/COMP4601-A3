<meta name="summary" content="One of the funniest movies I've seen for a while"></head><body><p>From the beginning, it's obvious that "Hot Tub Time Machine" was written and directed by people who knew what they were doing.  This movie starts off funny and energetic, and doesn't waste time getting to the titular hot tub.  I'm a fan of when people say the name of the movie in a movie, and the part where someone says the name of the movie was very funny.  "Hot Tub Time Machine" keeps moving, pokes fun at 80s teen comedies, and doesn't let up on the comedy.  In a way, I'm surprised I liked this movie so much.  Yes, it is crude and vulgar, but in a way that works comedically.  And, yes, the characters at the beginning are unlikeable across the board, which is usually a recipe for unfunny disaster.  However, the actors are all professional and experienced enough, and the script is written well enough, to give us reasons to not hate the characters.  Indeed, you find yourself rooting for them, and more and more so as the movie goes on.  More to the credit of the script, "Hot Tub Time Machine" is devoid of maudlin drama bits where the characters get sappy at the end; they do undergo change, but it's organic and fits in the movie as a whole.  It's great to see Cusack in a role once again where he can be really funny and show off his comedic talents.<br /><br />"Hot Tub Time Machine" also doesn't overstay its welcome, at an hour forty, which is about as long as a comedy should ever be.  I haven't laughed this much at a movie for a long time.  Unless you are a person who objects to vulgar humor, you will likely enjoy this, and it is at least worth a rent.</p></body></html>

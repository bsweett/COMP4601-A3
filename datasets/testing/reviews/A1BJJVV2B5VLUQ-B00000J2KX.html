This adaptation was definitely not. Kubrick was thought to be a genious... The Overlook Hotel somewhere in the hills of Colorado - what better place for Nickolson to strut his absolute  best work. Shelley Duvall was an excellent choice to play the scatterbrain  wife with the wide popping eyes at all the right times. The flashbacks and  things little Danny sees really set the stage and without being graphic or  gross - totally horrifies you. A few memorable scenes... 1. The Interview,  2. Nicholson is interrupted by Duvall while typing, 3. Nicholson chasing  Duvall up the stairs and cornering her in the bathroom, and 4. the chase in  the snowy cold garden labyrinth. Do not watch this film alone at night.  Classic horror/suspense film that belongs in any movie buff's library.</p></body></html>

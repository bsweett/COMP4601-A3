<meta name="summary" content="A frenetic thriller that's more accomplished than 'Identity'"></head><body><p>Two years ago, (...) when The Bourne Identity turned out to be a good movie and The Sum of All Fears, well, sucked. He's back in full force with the sequel, part two of three, a movie that not only improves on the original but really sets the bar high for the third and final film. In the able hands of director Paul Greengrass, the movie whips and whirs along with the thrill of great storytelling, great action sequences, and really great acting. Case in point: Joan Allen. I loved her in The Contender, thought she was one of the best things about The Notebook, but she enters the realm of 'Oscar Contender' here for her fierce, engaging portrayal of Pamela Landy, easily one of the strongest female supporting roles to come along in a while. But let's not forget Matt Damon, either; he brings a complexity to a role that could have been a cardboard cut-out instead.<br /><br />  And I don't know if it's just me, but the action scenes in Supremacy tower above the first film, as well. Greengrass has wisely chosen to shoot the movie with many, many setups on action scenes, and handheld cameras throughout. Just about every violent moment in the movie ranges from engrossing to flat out pants-pissing exciting, and only in a huge car chase at the end of the film does it cross that ever-so-thin line of plausibility. Is The Bourne Supremacy a masterpiece of spy-thriller moviemaking? Nah, not really. But these kinds of movies are a dime a dozen lately, and when one as technically assured and extremely well-acted as Bourne hits screens, it's obvious that it's worth every penny of those 7 bucks.

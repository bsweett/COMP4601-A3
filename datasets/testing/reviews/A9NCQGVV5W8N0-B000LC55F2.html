<meta name="summary" content="At War With Wizards..."></head><body><p>A decent little film that will keep you entertained, even if you, like I, work out the twist in the first five minutes. It goes off on a completely different tack from Christopher Priest's novel, but in a very interesting way (and to the point that even the author apparently prefers Nolan's vision of the concept to his own). Michael Caine does his usual splendid job of subtly stealing every scene that he's in from the two leads and David Bowie makes a beautifully underplayed cameo appearance as Nikola Tesla.</p></body></html>

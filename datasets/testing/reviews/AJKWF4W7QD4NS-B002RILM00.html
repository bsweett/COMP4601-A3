<meta name="summary" content="Needless, pointless re-make of a classic horror film"></head><body><p>Every couple months or so, there seems to be a slew of horror film re-makes that flood the market.  We had Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Hills Have Eyes, and even the upcoming Black Christmas, and now, another classic horror film has a needless, pointless re-make, and it's the Wicker Man.  Nicolas Cage stars as a cop investigating the disappearance of a young girl in a mysterious island community.  What he soon discovers is a religious cult that has their own secret, and thus, let the schlock fest begin.  What many fans of the original film, this one included, complained about the most, was the gender transforming of Lord Summersisle (originally played by Christopher Lee) into a woman (Ellen Burstyn).  While Burstyn does her best, Cage is wooden, and the rest of the cast, including Deadwood's Molly Parker and Leelee Sobieski, are just plain bad.  Not to mention that where the original film was a creepy, sexy, haunting satire of differing religions and communities, this version is just a watered down, wanna-be horror film with lame, typical conventions that you see coming before the film even starts.  All in all, the Wicker Man re-make is nothing that is worth seeing, but fans of the original classic already know this.</p></body></html>

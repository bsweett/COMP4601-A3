<meta name="summary" content="A different kind of family movie, and one that works on many levels!"></head><body><p>As the movie begins a clear dislike of everyone but the little girl develops, but then it starts to warm up.  One after another each family member shows a humanity, focusing on Olive.  She realizes that she is no beauty, but she has convinced herself, and everyone else, that she has the skills needed for winning the Little Miss Sunshine contest.  With one mishap after another each member of the family develops a depth and snese of caring that helps them coalesce into a full and happy family.<br /><br />Dysfunctional?  Not a bit.  The family functions very well, as much as any other family, even with initial starts and stops, with each one caring for the other, which is no more apparent than at the end of the movie.  The movie is certainly not predictable, although in hindsight, Olive's performance, being coached by her foul-mouthed coke-sniffing grandfather, could have been nothing else but the delightful shocker that it was.<br /><br />On another level, this movie helped to expose the promiscuity of the parents who send their little girls to beauty contests, parading them as adults.  This is just sick, and the movie makes this point very, very well.<br /><br />A different kind of family movie, and one that works on many levels.</p></body></html>

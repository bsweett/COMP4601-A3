<meta name="summary" content="Cat and mouse games ensue amongst Denzel, Clive, and Jodie..."></head><body><p>Renegade director Spike Lee and actor Denzel Washington (MO' BETTER BLUES, MALCOLM X, HE GOT GAME) team up for the fourth time in this absorbing and byzantine caper film. Denzel plays Police Detective Keith Frazier, toiling in the Hostage Negotiation Team, who, along with his partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), gets assigned to a daytime robbery at the Manhattan Trust Bank which had escalated into a hostage situation. But, with a cerebral criminal mastermind (Clive Owen) who seems to have thought of every contingency and is always one step ahead of the law and, also, with the involvement of a mysterious female civilian negotiatior (Jodie Foster), things get very murky indeed.<br /><br />As usual with these types of films, there are layers of complexity woven into the plot. Nagging questions surface thru the course of the film which perplex the viewer. Why does the leader of the robber gang seem to be stalling? Why is the elderly chairman of the bank's Board of Director (Christopher Plummer) so invested in the goings-on? What exactly is Jodie Foster's character up to? Why do the robbers dig a hole in the storeroom? And, because this is a Spike Lee joint, there are several scene interjections of social and racial relevance. Let's face it, we're living in the post 9/11 era and Lee's sequence of the "Arab's" treatment by the police, in particular, underscores that plainly.<br /><br />The magnetic Denzel Washington is again superb (but, really, when does the guy ever suck?). He always brings to his role an aura of cool assuredness and a certain stylish bravura. His smile, as usual, when directed at potential perpetrators, contains a biting intensity. Clive Owen is equally very good as the self-contained and calculated villain of the story, somehow becoming sympathetic enough that you sort of root for him. His opening lines, as he breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the viewer, makes him an instantly intriguing figure. Jodie Foster doesn't do as well in her nebulous role of a smirky, high-powered transactionist but she does do enough, acting-wise, to rouse the audience's curiousity. I do feel, however, that Chiwetel Ejiofor's talent is wasted here as he isn't given enough script with which to get his hands dirty.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN isn't exactly set at a breaknecked pace. It's a contemplative feature film, a thinking man's thriller with very few action set pieces, though tension is maintained and remains palpable throughout. The movie's main selling point is the cast, who makes the most out of this twisty caper premise. This complement of actors has got to be Spike Lee's most star powered group yet. Now, the ending might leave a few audiences disgruntled for not having enough "punch" but it's perfectly in line with the cerebral tone of the movie.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN proves the versatility of Spike Lee as a director as, this time out, he tackles a suspense film and does a more than adequate job. Once again, Spike ventures into slice-of-life, character-driven interplays, even giving his lesser actors time to briefly shine in the spotlight. There is one sequence - wherein the sergeant first on the crime scene reveals his casual racial prejudices to Detective Frazier - that I thought particularly effective. One of my favorite moments in the film is the scene wherein the police, after having solved a puzzle postured by the heist ringleader, continue to humorously argue about the details of the puzzle. And, then there's the prim-looking white guy whose cell's ring tone is Kanye West's "Golddigger." Anyway, if you don't mind sitting thru a film over two hours long - a film which, by the way, might require more than one viewing - and consulting your brain cells throughout its screening, then INSIDE MAN is for you. Plus, that Indian song, "Chaiyya Chaiyya," is kinda slamming.</p></body></html>

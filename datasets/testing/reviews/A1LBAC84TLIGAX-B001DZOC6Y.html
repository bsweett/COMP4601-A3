I've watched a lot of M. Night Shyamalan films like The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, and Lady in the Water and enjoyed them all, and I liked this movie.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: It begins in Central Park in New York, whenever a strange wind blows people stop like their frozen in time and then kill themselves. Jumping off buildings, shooting themselves, stabbing themselves, the works. Then it begins moving to small towns, roads, and eventually to even the most deserted places across the eastern states. This phenomenon is caused by plants that give off a strange chemical which causes people to harm themselves in some way because the plants are angry and wanting to get back at humans. It's mostly centered around a group of survivors from New Jersey; a man and his wife, and a little girl are the main characters who try to survive this occurrence. The story may be flawed, but it does a decent job of putting itself together, and it's definitely M. Night Shyamalan because of how bizarre the film is.<br />MUSIC: The music is great and really nows how to fit the atmosphere and mood of this movie.<br />DISTURBING FACTOR: Most of the ways people get killed in this movie are things I've already seen, but some scenes flatout shocked me like the part where the two boys get killed in the movie unexpectedly. Some of the deaths are shocking in this movie, but it's not very disturbing overall.<br />ACTING: The acting is generally good, though I did notice some sequences of cheesy acting. The dialogue is nicely assembled at least and adds to the film's creepy value.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: I don't know about you, but I found this movie to be rather entertaining and interesting. It mostly depends on how willing are you to take chances with a film that got bad reviews from critics? The acting in this movie is good, the dialogue is good, the creepy factor is good, and the music is great. A highly entertaining and underrated film.<br />OVERALL: Approach with caution, rent before buy. This film is not for everyone and there is a deep divide between people who think it's good and people who think it sucks. Be warned.<br />THE GOOD: Good acting, great music, good creepy factor, good dialogue, interesting premise for a story.<br />THE BAD: Story is flawed and sometimes stupid, some acting sequences were cheesy, and the film is sometimes too weird for its own good.</p></body></html>

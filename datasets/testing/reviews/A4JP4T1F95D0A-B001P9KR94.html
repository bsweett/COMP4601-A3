The story is of a slumdog who is on India's "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" and manages to get the questions right.  He is picked up by the police who doubt an uneducated child of the streets could know the answer, therefore he must be cheating.  Through flashbacks that cut back and forth between then and current time on the show, the viewer is shown how he knows each answer and why.  It is both an uplifting story, and a tragic one.  I wish that is was completely fiction, and not based on the real sad lives of the children on India's streets.  Very good movie.</p></body></html>

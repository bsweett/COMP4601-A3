<meta name="summary" content="The another side of Hannibal!"></head><body><p>Many people remained astonished after the film . Confused perhaps because they had tought this was a sequel but this is a wrong appreciation.<br /><br />In fact Hannibal is free in this case and precisely this fact makes the things turn around .<br /><br />The artistic gaze is a crude and brilliant exercise of superb good taste . Think in Florence the ancient memories of Hannibal in his prison 's pictures , and besides the nest of the Reinassance .<br /><br />Think besides in Dante , Pazzi and consider his death as poetic justice .<br /><br />You may argue the film is gore , but what do you expect from Hannibal?<br /><br />The cast is splendid . Oldman made a glamorous tour de force as an invalid hunger of revenge .<br /><br />The erotic presence of Julianne Moore makes Clarence Sterling a little bit altered respect to Jodie Foster .<br /><br />The first entry is a pshycological thriller. This part is a hard multiple chase from Pazzi and the FBI and simulateously all of them seeking Hannibal , superbly played by Anthony Hopkins possibly the best actor in the world who just was working in Titus Andronicus .<br /><br />The default perhaps resides in some minor aspects such as : How can Dr. Lecter to travel from Europe to USA being one of the ten most dangerous criminals and how could Clarence penetrate in the Oldman ' home with such easiness ?<br /><br />If you let these questions to the random you may enjoy of a very clever and intelligent drama which will face you against our particular dragons .<br /><br />Brilliant artistic direction , superb photography , memorable acting of Giancarlo Gianini (nominated in 1976 for his breathtaking performance in Seven beauties), Ray Liotta and a bit of Francesca Neri .<br /><br />Not recommended for squeamish tastes or sensible viewers.</p></body></html>

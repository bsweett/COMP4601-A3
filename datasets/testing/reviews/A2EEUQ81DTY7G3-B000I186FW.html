<meta name="summary" content=""People shouldn't be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people""></head><body><p>V For Vendetta certainly tackles some provocative and timely themes: media and government manipulation, and terrorism and the old adage that power corrupts and governments will single-handedly manipulate the populace to stay in power.  The film is packed with ideas - sometimes a little too many - but it's a smartly designed and superbly acted thriller and it actually gives you something to think about while you're watching the Britain's Parliament House get blown up.<br /><br />V For Vendetta indeed presents a scary scenario. It is England in 2020. The effects of world instability, including the downfall of the United States, have finally reached the country and now fascist political party has come to power, in the form of a draconian Thatcherism predicated on order, conformity and intolerance.<br /><br />With the government mushrooming into totalitarian repression, the public is controlled through police repression, surveillance and propaganda - particularly through the media. High Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) is a despot who rants from giant video monitors. Homosexuality or owning a Koran - unauthorized love and unauthorized faith - are capital crimes and free speech is seen as a disloyalty to the party, to the government and to the country. Into this mix comes the freedom fighter V (Hugo Weaving) who wears a mask and models himself in Britain's most famous revolutionary, Guy Fawkes.<br /><br />V is a revolutionary and an ideologue, his conversation is dense with analysis and philosophy; his fortress of solitude isn't a museum of weaponry, but a vast library and art gallery. He is a fearsome hand-to-hand fighter, who thinks of nothing of murdering to make his point. The center of his campaign is the protection of Evey (a ravishing Natalie Portman) when he saves her from being menaced by the secret police for violating curfew.<br /><br />The police (led by Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) suspect that Evey is his accomplice, and V takes her into his sanctum for her own protection. As she witnesses him blow up the Old Bailey, Every falls ever more into V's revolutionary web. The screenplay by the Wachowski Brothers parallels areas of government surveillance, torture, fear-mongering and media manipulation, not to mention corporate corruption and religious hypocrisy, the references to current events being opportune depending on your world view.<br /><br />Whilst the back-story involving both Evey and V's past is a little convoluted, the Director James McTeigue adroitly visualizes the multifaceted story and keeps the action moving at a fast pace. At times, the script is a little overly alliterative and a section involving Stephen Fry's television host is filmed in such a way that it's hard to tell what's going on.<br /><br />The actors, however, are all suburb: Portman is wrenching as the victimized Evey, well matched by the masked Weaving, who crafts a terrific performance from body language and vocal inflections. Although V for Vendetta is not without its faults, it's still a timely, surprisingly entertaining and totally thought-provoking film on a future-world that could so easily come about in any country given the right political environment.

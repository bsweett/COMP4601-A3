<meta name="summary" content="Superb movie of a wonderful and deservedly well-loved story"></head><body><p>"The Chronicles of Narnia" is one of those rare sets of stories that are meaningful to children, teens, and adults.  However, what is especially interesting about these stories is that they mean very different things to people at different ages while retaining their ability to convey it central message to everyone.  There is a reason this set of stories has grown in popularity and reputation over the past fifty-plus years.  C. S. Lewis created his stories drawing on his rich understanding of myth, his Christian faith, and his brilliance as a writer.<br /><br />Kids will love the fantasy and adventure.  There will be moments of great wonder and even some of fear, but all of this great movie will delight them.  Teens will relate to the four main characters and their complete loss of control over their lives during the terrible Blitz of World War II and then having to rise to the challenges that face them in the very strange world of Narnia.  Adults will enjoy all the adventure and fantasy, but also the way ancient myths and characters are used to dress out what is basically a Christological message.<br /><br />Then there is the achievement of the film itself.  The visual aspects of the film are simply marvelous to behold.  It is something you will want to see many times (at least I do).  The achievement of Aslan as a character who exists only in a computer or briefly as three different models, well, that is a tour de force of the animator's art.  Having to get such a beloved and well known story into a film that can be shown at commercial length and still delight fans of the books is also an accomplishment to be proud of.<br /><br />The characters on the screen and the voices chosen for the animations are all spot on.  I enjoyed every performance in the film and am delighted to own this DVD to watch with my family many times.<br /><br />The extras on this deluxe 2 DVD edition are unbelievably rich.  You get a voice over with the director and the four children of the cast, another voice over with the director and a few of the other creative talents who helped make the movie, and another feature with pop up informational bits.  So, you can watch the movie four times and without watching it the same way twice.  Then there is also a montage of bloopers that is a bit of fun.  This is all just on the first disk.<br /><br />The second disk is crammed full of features that will show you what seems to be every aspect of making the film.  We get features of the director, all the principle creative talents including the producer.  Then there are features about the story C.S. Lewis created and how all the other artists had to tell that story through their individual crafts.  So much of the original story has to be interpreted to get it on the screen.  The areas where images, sounds, and effects would have been supplied by the reader's imagination have to be made explicit in a movie, and what we have been given here is amazing.<br /><br />There is another feature on the creating of the creatures and one on a single amazing scene and how it was put together from filming done in a half-dozen countries.  There is even a map of Narnia that the viewer can explore in 3-D computer generation.<br /><br />Even the case of this deluxe edition is interesting and evokes the main idea of the magical wardrobe.  It also includes a couple of postcard-sized reproductions of the concept art for the movie.<br /><br />I recommend this for everyone and especially families to watch and talk about together.  There is a lot in these stories and a lot to draw out of each other about what the meaning each took from the various scenes and images.</p></body></html>

All future movies of it's kind should be so good. Unfortunatley, most of them haven't been. Save a few. This original film was the "origin" of Superman and Clark Kent. Telling it from the beginning. Basically, here is the story. On the planet of Krypton, about to meet it's end, Jor-El and his wife Lara, send their baby son Kal-El to earth in a small spaceship. Ot crash lands in the small farming town of Smallville, Kansas. The little boy is picked up by local couple, Jonathan and Martha Kent(Glen Ford, Phyllis Thaxter). Right off the bat, the little boy showed super powers. Flash forward several years, and young Clark(as they named him, and played by Jeff East for these scenes), is leaving home. Read to go out on his own and find out who he is and his true calling. Once he makes it to Metropolis, Christopher Reeve steps into the role. He gets a job as a reporter for The Daily Planet, under the employment of Rough and grumy Perry White(The great Jackie Cooper). Soon, Clark is accquainted with feisty reporter Lois Lane(Margot Kidder), and boyishly wholesome photographer, Jimmy Olsen(Marc McClure). Gene Hackman plays millionaire madman, Lex Luthor. With the help of his sidekicks Otis(Ned Beatty), and Miss Tesmacher(Valerie Perrine), Lex plans on taking over the world, unless Superman can stop him. Ned Beatty and Valerine Perrine donate some comedic relief to the proceedings as Lex's team. This is a real high class production. The performances are well done and fleshed out, and carry the film to the grand adventure that it is. Reeve was a virtual unknown at the time, and was only 26 I believe. He did a phenomenal job his first time out, brillaintly creating two seperate people in one, with Superman and Clark. He was wonderful. Hackman is a pro, and he chews the scenery with scene stealing bravado, owning every frame he is in. Kidder was perfectly cast as Lois Lane. She had that right sense of perkiness, determination, and strength, that makes the character endearing. Cooper is a delight with his portrayal of Perry, and McClure brings the right level of 'ah shucks' to his bow tied photographer. One cannot exclude Marlon Brando, who was paid millions for his few days(and few minutes)of work on the film. The script is expertly written by Mario Puzo("The Godfather"). It is such a well structured script that tells the beginning, and origin, of the legend, and is incredibly tight. Richard Donner's direction was flawless. He captures every scene and makes every moment count. There are numerous scenes here etched in fans' heads, and lines as well, and that makes for a rather unforgettable adventure. There are also some nice little cameos in the movie. The original Superman, Kirk Alyn, plays Lois' father early in the movie when they are on a train, and the original TV lois, Noel Neil, plays her mom. Now, with Bryan Singer doing "Superman Returns" for 2006, with Brandon Routh as Clark/Superman, Kate Bosworth as Lois, and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, he has a lot to live up too. With Spacey being cast, it's already on the right track. The best superhero movie of all time.</p></body></html>

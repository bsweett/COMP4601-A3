<meta name="summary" content="Superman Returns . . . And Boy was He Missed!"></head><body><p>Superman Returns shows us just how much we have all missed Superman and still need him.  Of course, comparisons to Christopher Reeve are inevitable as he made the role his own, but Routh makes it his own as well.  Although he looks and sounds just like Reeve, intended by the studio no doubt, he is a good actor who brings depth to the role.  Okay, now for the specifics on the film:<br /><br />Plot: Well-conceived improvement over similar ideas presented in Superman I and II (slicing off California to enhance property value at the fault line and monkeying around with the Fortress of Solitude).  I also think it was a terrific idea to have this film pick up after Superman II where Lois and Superman, while reduce to a normal guy, get together.  This allows us to forget the dreaded sequels that followed and breathes life into the franchise with perhaps a "superboy" down the road.  In addition, this element in the story reminds us how Superman takes the high moral ground.  In Superman II he selfishly gave up his powers to sleep with Lois Lane and after realizing this error he sacrifices a normal life for the lonely hero life as the world still needs him.  To invade Lois's and his son's life at this point would be morally wrong and as equally selfish as when he gave up his powers in Superman II for a chance at a regular life and he knows it and, therefore, decides to step back from Lois and his own son's life (although we see he obviously cares when he observes them without them knowing it).  That's one big sacrifice and NOT a shirking of his duties as one reviewer here suggested.<br /><br />Character Development/Acting: Much time is devoted to character development than in most superhero films of the past (excluding X-Men and Spider-Man), especially regarding James Marsden of X-Men fame who is now Lois Lane's husband to be.  He has to struggle with the memory and return of the Man of Steel, and trying to be the best man for Lois and hero to his own son (who is really Superman's son).  He is very believable in this role.  Frank Langella is perfect as newspaper head and Lois Lane is wonderfully played by Kate Bosworth even to the point where you wish she was the original Lois Lane.  I never cared for Margot Kidder much in that role so I'm a bit bias here.  Of course, a superhero film isn't complete without the villain and Lex Luther as played by Kevin Spacey is perfect casting.  We never really feared Gene Hackman's Lex as he was a bit too cartoonish even though he damn near stole the second movie right out from under Superman.  Kevin is funny where he needs to be and punishingly ruthless where he has to be.<br /><br />Last, but not least is Brandon Routh, AKA Superman.  He knows he has big shoes to fill not just in Reeve's command of the role before him, but also in that many learned to love Reeve during his tragic post-Superman life wherein he really proved he was Superman with the courage he faced everyday while being a paraplegic.  I am one of those who grew to love and appreciate Christopher Reeve and I cried at his passing as did my children.  Someone new taking over this role established so well by a beloved actor has it's challenges and just as many are leary of Daniel Craig as the new Bond, some may be just as suspicious of Routh's Superman.  No need to be.  He pulls off the role with great skill and respect.  You can see the sadness in his eyes when he learns that Lois has moved on without him, had a son, is about to get married, and no longer believes the world needs Superman.  He is perfect for the role in spite of the studio's wish to simply find someone to mimic the looks of Reeve.  Routh is an acting find for this role and I look forward to seeing him in other roles as well.<br /><br />Director:  Who best to work behind the camera on this than veteran action TV series and X-Men movie director Bryan Singer.  He continues to prove his metal, forgive the pun, while working on the Man of Steel.  The story is well-paced between action sequences that are truly breathtaking and the plot and character development sequences.  He did a bang up job with this film.<br /><br />Special Effects:  Well, what is a superhero movie without them?  Those in this film are mind-boggling, especially the plane sequence in the early part of the film.  In fact, that sequence is probably the best in the film, but that doesn't mean the rest are poor, just not as good.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is fun for the whole family except those really young ones who might get a bit upset over the punishing beating Superman gets when he temporarily loses his powers late in the film.  That beating is rather graphic, hence the PG-13 rating.</p></body></html>

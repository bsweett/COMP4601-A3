<meta name="summary" content="There be dragons"></head><body><p>How to Train Your Dragon has all of the best qualities of Pixar/Dreamworks movies: the lovable characters, great CG graphics, and comedy. While the overall design of the dragons is comic, their skin looks incredibly realistic. I did however take one star off for lack of originality. In many respects, the plot is pretty predictable and the same as many other "boy-meets-the-enemy" type movies. The boy befriends the dragon a bit too easily, first with food then healing his broken tail fin. Overall, it's a cute story, and families will surely enjoy it, but I don't know how much enduring appeal it will have.</p></body></html>

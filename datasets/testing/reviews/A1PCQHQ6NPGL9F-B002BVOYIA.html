<meta name="summary" content="Good acting by Cheadle, but average movie overall"></head><body><p>Hotel Rwanda is just average. Cheadle does a great job. He speaks well with an accent, and he is very convincing when everything falls apart around him. When he speaks to the staff at the hotel about calling loved ones, you feel like he means what he says. When he cries from the dead bodies along the road, you feel his despair.  Although Jamie Foxx won an oscar for Ray, I think that Cheadle did a better job of making me connect with someone I had never heard of before.<br /><br />Aside from Cheadle's acting, not much in the film stands out in my opinion. When people are getting slaughtered everywhere, I am confused as to what Nick Nolte is actually doing. He doesn't shoot anyone during the entire film, even when people are being killed around him. I'm not saying he should of killed someone, but it's hard to connect with someone who doesn't seem enthusiastic about helping. Don Cheadle's Wife in my opinion is flat out terrible. She isn't likeable at all. Moreso, she is always crying about something. She cries at the drop of a hat(cliche), and it just makes her appear weak and cowardly. Yes, tons of people are dying around her, but she doesn't have to bawl at every chance she gets. The other part of the movie I hated was the ending. The ending just feels rushed. I'm not saying the ending is bad. It just feels like they made it in a hurry to make a different movie.</p></body></html>

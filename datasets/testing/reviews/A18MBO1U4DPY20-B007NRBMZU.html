Had I watched it earlier, I would have realise how seamless this film is in terms of storyline and shock value._Ashton Kutcher_ plays the role of not one but two lifetimes. This movie is probably ONE OF THE THREE most engrossing films I have seen in the latter half of this year. It took me one hour to realise what the film was all about and it took me an hour and five mins to realise I was wrong. This film is likely to question your own ability to access your own sub-conscience and thought analysing extremes. The last half an hour of the film was gripping and also extremely well directed. The pace of the film is shocking and the effects are super. I can go on and on about the film but I would never really be able to fully comprehend in my review what this film is "all" about.Hey reader, Watch this film you think you deserve the need to deserve to watch it.<br /><br />PS - The other two films that shocked me this year were "Oldboy" and "Crash" [Click on me for reviews]</p></body></html>

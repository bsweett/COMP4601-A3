I was both ecstactic and sceptical to hear it would be turned into a feature film.  Picture books don't tend to translate well to feature length films (See Jumanji, Cat in the Hat, the Grinch).  Yet the team behind this guaranteed that care would be given to the treatment of the material.<br /><br />Care is given to the material.  The world of the film is true to the world of the book.  Attention is given to little things such as being able to see the wolves from the train.  The theme is that of innocence, and if you're looking for a film that encapsulates innocence, look no further.  Zemekis and crew do a fantastic job of illustrating the innocence of children at Chrismastime.  This film has a lot of spirit going for it.  And by far, it is the most innocent, 100% kid friendly movie I've seen in recent memory.<br /><br />The filmmakers take some liberties.  Notably in adding some conflict, such as difficulties in reaching the North Pole, creating some side characters, and adding more depth to the North Pole that is featured ever so briefly in the book.  The best addition is easily the homeless man who appears only to the Hero boy on top of the train.  The worst has to be some awkward decisions about the North Pole.  Sorry, but the ultra futuristic look and Santa's rainbow whip kinda turned me off.<br /><br />Then there is the design.  This movie looks specatacular - in 3D.  And if you see this in Imax 3D, it is a breathtaking experience.  However, on DVD the 3D experience is not there to reveal the film's many shortcomings.  For one, "oohs" and "ahs" of the 3D experience are replaced with the filmmakers attempts to stretch the story into a 100 minute feature.  Furthermore, the supposedly groundbreaking "acting" in the film makes the people's movements seem awkward.  While the actual character designs are fine (though I would probably reconsider some of the facial expressions in the film), the movements do not allow you to suspend yourself in disbelief.  The final blow is the film's music.  The score is fine, which seems to recall Silversti's own Back to the Future, while also recalling another winter based score, Danny Elfman's score to Edward Scissorhands.  Sadly, the same can't be said for the film's songs, which lack the immediacy and poignancy of Disney's animated features.<br /><br />Overall, the Polar Express is a great family film that fares better on the big screen than on the small one.  On the small screen, the story moves slowly and the visuals don't come to life nearly as well as they do on the huge Imax screen.  Zemekis and all involved capture the innocence of the book perfectly, but can't stretch the theme of the story to keep us sustained for 100 minutes.  Catch it at the Imax in 3D or read the book.  As a stand alone film at home, it may be a snoozer.</p></body></html>

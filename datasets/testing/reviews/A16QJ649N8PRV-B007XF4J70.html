It is a real gem.<br /><br />Made in 1942, it is set in French unoccupied Morocco.  It features Humphrey Bogart as nightclub owner Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa.  Rick had not seen Ilsa since the day of the Nazi invasion of Paris when they were separated.  She shows up in his club with her husband Victor Lazlo who is an underground leader.  He had been imprisoned by the Germans and Rick had not known she was married.<br /><br />It is an unusual love triangle.  Rick has portrayed himself as apolitical.  He has to decide whether to assist the cause or pursue his love.<br /><br />Although I am not usually one who enjoys romance type movies, this one is very good.  I enjoyed it.  This one is well worth watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The ending totally shocked me"></head><body><p>I love it when a movie can surprise me since it's rare that ever happens.  So when I come across a movie like "The Others" that I thought I had all figured out, only to be delightfully proved wrong, I get very excited.  There's a plot twist involving the elderly couple that I guessed early on, and I suspect most audiences will suspect early on.  However, the final ending was something I had NO idea was going to happen.<br /><br />This movie moves slowly in some parts, however, Nicole Kidman's character is so bizarre that I was able to keep interested in this movie even during the slow parts.  I kept trying to figure her out.<br />An example of her bizarre behavior is in the beginning when she takes all these special precautions and administers warnings before anyone can even see her kids.  I kept wondering if her kids had rabies or something.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased that there's still master filmmakers out there who can delight audiences with great plot twists.</p></body></html>

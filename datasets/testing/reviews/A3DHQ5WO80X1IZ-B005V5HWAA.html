<meta name="summary" content="Creepy thriller"></head><body><p>Pretty good psychological thriller with Kevin Costner playing a serial killer. He does a good job playing creepy, and William Hurt is funny and hammy as his alter ego. Even Dane Cook is decent (I thought someone else could have done a better job, but he didn't embarrass himself).</p></body></html>

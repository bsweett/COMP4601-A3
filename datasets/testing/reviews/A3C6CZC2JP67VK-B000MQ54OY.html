The characters are well developed and the imagery is extraordinary. My only problem with this part of the movie is that there are too many songs crammed into it. You know that Mumble is going to be different, and when he does arrive on the Earth, the film does a grand job in making the other penguins exclude him for his lack of singing skill, and we quickly feel sorry for the young Mumble, who is thrust into a nasty world straight from birth. The start of the film is very touching, but lacks on the comedy and general interest, and therefore, the film could not have continued in that way forever. And it quickly changed - with the film being best having Mumble as a teenager. He then realizes that people are sick of his uniqueness now and that he is making the others feel humiliated, and that he could well be on his way to an early death.<br /><br />The film started to have more comedy from this point on - thank God for the Latino penguins. If it wasn't for them, the film could hardly even be called a comedy. Though it is meant to be touching, some of the action is extremely high-octane - when the penguins slide down cliffs into the sea, it makes for an overwhelming experience on the silver screen, and it may even thrill you. Though this film tries to be a masterpiece with its important message and generally effective characters and script, it is the animation that makes it brilliant - it is easily one of the best I have seen this year. It is all beautiful, and it truly raises the bar for animation in the future. The film is full of star-studded voice talents, from the youthful Elijah Wood to the irresistibly comedic Robin Williams, who entertains the audience with a feast of accidents and sessions of improvisation.<br /><br />Happy Feet isn't exactly a monumental film and probably won't have any effect on the environmental problems we suffer now, but the animation and story is good. Children will enjoy the clever animation and fun music. The story is a bit too detailed for younger children but the older members of the family will follow it. The movie is longer than what most children will sit through but the love story is endearing and the adventure is thrilling. If you liked March of the Penguin's, you'll love this movie. Even if you didn't like March of the Penguin's, Happy Feet still offers plenty to enjoy.</p></body></html>

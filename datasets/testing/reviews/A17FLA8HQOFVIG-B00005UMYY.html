The word "memento" means "remember" in Latin, and the story is about Leonard, so traumatized by a blow to the head after his wife's rape and murder, that he has lost his short-term memory. He's out for revenge and is looking for the killer, but, although he remembers his life with his wife and who he is, he cannot remember anything that has happened since.  He therefore takes Polaroid shots of everyone he meets and writes notes on them.  And he also tattoos things he wants to remember all over his body. The role calls out for an exceptional actor and Guy Pearce certainly does rise to the occasion.  I found myself drawn to him, identifying with his condition, and joining him in his struggle to relate to the world.<p>The story unfolds backwards, an unusual narrative technique that is tricky to use.  We see a scene and think we understand.  And then there is another scene that has happened prior to it, and it totally changes our perception of what is going on.  Purposely, it is confusing.  And purposely, there are moments of clarity where it all fits together only to become even more confusing in the next scene.  Carrie Ann Moss plays a femme fatal and, as we get to know her, we are not quite sure what her motives are.  Joe Pantolino is cast as in the role of Leonard's buddy, and we are constantly confused as to whether he is friend or foe.<p>I sat there fascinated as this complicated plot unfolded, enjoying the mastery in which the director led me down different avenues of thought and also introduced questions about the moral issues involved.  By the end, I was absolutely sure of nothing at all, except that I had been traveling on a roller coaster of an experience that didn't have any easy answers.  While I tend to want films to have a beginning, middle and end, and a story line that is easy to follow, this an exception to the rule.  I definitely recommend to those who are willing to explore this unique film, which is certainly one of a kind.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If LOUD blasts of sound scare you...this is your cup of tea!"></head><body><p>Lately, there have been a lot of PG-13 rated horror movies, most of which have drawn critical and public lambasting.  BOOGEYMAN, CURSED, THE GRUDGE, WHITE NOISE, even RING 2.  One criticism often leveled by the public is that the "whimpy" PG-13 rating is causing the filmmakers to soften the horror of the movies.  Well, this weekend saw the arrival of an R-rated horror movie, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, and it pretty much proves one thing...the R-rating ISN'T what these other movies were lacking to be good.<br /><br />AMITYVILLE is a lousy movie, pure and simple.  I'm old enough to remember the original phenomenon.  The Lutz family buys a house for a great price because the previous residents had been horrifically murdered in it.  28 days later, the Lutz's run from the house in horror because they nearly suffered the same fate.  Soon, a "non-fiction" novel of their story came out.  The Lutz's made the rounds of less picky talk shows and basically, a huge urban legend sprung up.  Their story was TRUE!!  (Of course, it was all a hoax, but who cares about that!).  Then a movie came out, and everyone was all in an uproar over the walls that bled!  Cool!!!  But the movie, with James Brolin and Margot Kidder was schlock then and it's certainly dreadful now.<br /><br />Then here comes a remake that doesn't even bring the zeitgeist of the original with it.  We take it as pure fiction right from the get-go, despite the title card stating "Based on a True Story."  Yep, it truly is a story alright.<br /><br />The thrills are predictable in the extreme.  Most of them are heralded with a burst of loud music.  Over and over.  Now, I will grant you that horror movies have been doing this for years...but this movie makes the most of the device.  It accompanies EVERYTHING that might be even remotely creepy.  LOUD NOISE=HUGE THRILL!!! Right??<br /><br />Wrong.  In one scene, the father (played by a bushy faced Ryan Reynolds...designed to make him look like the bearded James Brolin from the original) is watching some home movies.  He smiles.  Suddenly, one of the kids' faces briefly turns demonic, right on the film.  LOUD, LOUD BLAST OF SOUND!!  I just about had to laugh.  This wasn't scary at all.  The kid wasn't going to come out of the film and attack the father. It was just a weird little thing that would have been more effective with quiet music or none at all.  But no, why be subtle when a SLEDGEHAMMER OF SOUND is readily available.  Thus, the movie renders all its thrills equal.  There's really no sense of climax.  Right near the end, something horrible happens to a major character, and we actually think, "Cool, the movie is daring enough to surprise us in this way."  Nope, it was just a dream.<br /><br />Also horrific is the fact that the wonderfully talented Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights) plays the local priest as though a gun were being held to his head.  I assume he got a nice paycheck, or maybe did it on a bet or a dare, but he sure looks unhappy to be in this film.<br /><br />I give the film 2 stars, because I reserve 1 star reviews for the true dregs of the earth like FEAR DOT COM or THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES.  But this movie is just clumsy, unexciting and UNTHRILLING.  As for the R rating?  Well, one "F" bomb is dropped, and there are some disturbing images when we discover what REALLY happened on the land the house was built on.  Mind you, I said disturbing.  But not scary.  So, I don't recommend the movie for kids...or anyone else, for that matter!</p></body></html>

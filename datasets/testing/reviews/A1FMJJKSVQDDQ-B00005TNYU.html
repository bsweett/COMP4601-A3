Flight of the Navigator, Milo & Otis, Casper, and now The Goonies are just some of the family films that I remember watching when I was a little kid. I sure had a good time watching them either alone or with the entire family. The Goonies  I particularly remember very well for the underground adventures, and the characters Chunk & Sloth. They make a great duo, don't they? The booby traps and the "keys" to the hidden treasure were a bit frightening back then, but now they're pretty imaginative. This, along with the other family films that I've mentioned above never gets tedious. Of course, they don't! We loved them when we were kids, and it's not such a bad thing when you're looking for some childhood nostalgia. Although I slightly prefer Milo & Otis and others, The Goonies is still a great one.</p></body></html>

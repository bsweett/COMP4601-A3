The first time without the commentary on so you can appreciate the terrific jazz score by Rolfe Kent that terrifically underscores the action on the screen.  Criminally, Kent's score was not even nominated for an Oscar.  The commentary track by the film's stars Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church is indispensible and not to be missed.  This pair have infinite clever bon mots about the action on the screen and the making of the film.  As for the film itself it is a humorous account of two college buddies, one depressive the other libidinous, who go on an extended bachelor party through California wine country.  In the process they learn about life, love, themselves, some of it painful, some of it wickedly hilarious.  Director Alexander Payne with this film and his previous comic masterworks, "Election" and "About Schmidt" continues to rise to the upper echelon of American filmmakers.  We can thank him for advancing the careers here of Paul Giamatti, star of last year's brilliant "American Splendor", Thomas Haden Church, best known for his work in sitcoms, "Wings" and "Ned and Stacey".  Particular mention should be made of his utilization of Virginia Madsen as Maya, the waitress that captures the heart of Giamatti's character, Miles.  Madsen had fallen from grace with the powers-that-be in Hollywood even though she delivered solid work in movies as diverse as the horror film "Candyman" and Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of John Grisham's "The Rainmaker".  Here's hoping the success of this film is a springboard for the careers of all those involved.</p></body></html>

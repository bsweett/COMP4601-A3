<meta name="summary" content="And you thought Murray underplayed in "Lost in Translation"?"></head><body><p>If you thought Bill Murrary was underplaying in Focus Features' "Lost in Translation," he makes that role look like Tom Cruise on Oprah compared to what he puts on the screen here in "Broken Flowers."  Murray is completely believable as the undiagnosed yet obviously depressed, stuck and emotionally devoid Don Johnston.  A little pink envelope from a (ex-?)lover and wanna-be detective neighbor Winston (the great Jeffrey Wright) slowly but surely shakes Don from his moorings.<br /><br />I'll admit, like others, to feeling perplexed and unsatisfied by the ending.  However, I'll also own up to the fact that I completely missed a key clue in the movie, which - after realizing it later and piecing things together - I feel took me to a higher level of appreciation of Jim Jarmusch's direction.  Well played, Mr. Jarmusch.<br /><br />That's not to say "Broken Flowers" is on par with "Lost in Translation."  That was Murray's role of a lifetime - no question he deserved an Academy Award for that.  Let's hope for a make-up call here.<br /><br />And, what the world needs now is more Julie Delpy.  Her luminous presence at the beginning of "Broken Flowers" has me once again scratching my head trying to figure out why every director in Hollywood isn't beating down her door.  This smart, attractive actress should be on everyone's A-list.  Anyone who disagrees needs to watch her Nina Simone impression at the end of "Before Sunset."  She's so pitch-perfect and fetching, you'll be slack-jawed.</p></body></html>

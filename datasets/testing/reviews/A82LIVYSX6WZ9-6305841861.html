<meta name="summary" content="way better than the first"></head><body><p>without a doubt this one is way better than the original. more funny gags and gore galore. the funniest sequence would be at the beginning when Campbell is hit sky high then lands in the puddle and he shakes the demon out of him. then later on hes chased back to the cabin and all threw the house. just great. and the laughing deer head kicks ass too. a must see for anyone</p></body></html>

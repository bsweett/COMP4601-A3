<meta name="summary" content="Permanence vs. impermanence"></head><body><p>"Therefore, the Lord god banished Adam and Eve and placed a flaming sword to protect The Tree of Life." - Genesis 3:24<br /><br />Three intertwined stories that parallel in different eras (1500 AD, 2000 AD and 2500 AD). Three parallel journeys from darkness into light.<br /><br />We see a person (Hugh Jackman) struggling to hold on to life at any cost.  Will he succeed, fail, or learn something about just letting go in the process?<br /><br />Great background film score which has just as much presents as the actors. Brilliant images of Petri dishes and Rachel Weisz. We get a close up of the Tree of life and a new twist on its meaning.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6300182541">Resurrection - Ellen Burstyn</a></p></body></html>

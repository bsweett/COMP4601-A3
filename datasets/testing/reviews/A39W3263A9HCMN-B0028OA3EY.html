Pure fun and action, and Kate Bosworth is a total hottie! And great 3D effects aswell.<br /><br />PLOT: Clark Kent has returned. He is given his job back and finds out that Lois Lane has written an editorial about why the world dosen't need Superman. He later finds out that she has a new boyfriend, and Lex Luther has returned with a new crystal lair. While Lois is on the flight, It is in danger of crashing so Sperman stops it (the 2nd part in IMAX 3D). One day, Lois and her son are taken away on Lex's ship. Superman must save her!<br /><br />THOUGHTS: 10x better than expected. The best way to see it is in IMAX, which is how I saw it. You're in for one helluva ride when seeing it.<br /><br />So see this movie!</p></body></html>

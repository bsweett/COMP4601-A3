Whereas most sci-fi movies have characters and special effects, this movie has so much and so many special effects that they aren't special anymore.  They are the movie.  The characters are there just to provide a minimal vehical for a story to wrap special effects around.  I'm glad I saw this in a way that I didn't have to pay for it.<br /><br />Oh, and Megan Fox is beautiful enough in her own right without these posed glamour shots that seem designed only to provoke teenage lust.  To bad she didn't actually do more, you know, like acting and stuff.</p></body></html>

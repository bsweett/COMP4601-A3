Their powers aren't apparent immediately and are dormant upon re-entry.  However, towards the end of their quarantine upon re-entry the five individuals become aware of changes in their bodies:  Dr. Richard Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) has the ability to stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes and takes on the name of Mr. Fantastic; Susan Storm (Jennifer Alba) is Reed's love interest and brother of Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) finds that she is able to become invisible at will and create force fields and is known as the Invisible Woman; Johnny Storm finds he is capable of turning himself into a living human ball of fire and that he can fly and thus calls himself The Human Torch; Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) becomes the most changed of the group having gained superhuman strength and endurance, but through a growth spurt that not only increased his sized but covered his body in giant orange scales that look like rocks.  Also aboard the station at the time of the accident was the man who financed the project, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).  Doom doesn't outwardly acknowledge the changes occurring within him, which basically has to do with his body turning metal and some other secret skills, and blames Reed for allowing the accident to happen, even though Doom was the man at fault.  Of course, Doom was courting Sue Storm, so it doesn't help that Reed is the one who ends up winning her heart.  After revealing to the world their powers, the team tries to find a way to reverse the effects of the cosmic ray while Doom secretly plans to take over the world.<br /><br />FANTASTIC FOUR has some incredible special effects.  Apparently one of the scenes of The Human Torch flying over New York was completely computer generated and took four months to create.  Despite this, the movie is relatively low on action.  There's a major fight sequence at the end, but other than that there's not much.  The reason for this is that the studio behind the film plans on making FANTASTIC FOUR into at least a trilogy and as the first part of the trilogy, this film is intended to set up things that are to come later.<br /><br />I usually don't mention this, but FANTASTIC FOUR has some amazing makeup.  The Thing was not created using CGI, but instead was brought to life the old-fashioned way, through makeup and costuming.  In a day and age when many films completing ignore traditional ways of doing things, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't do that, especially in one that had so many other CGI created effects to begin with.<br /><br />I didn't read very many FANTASTIC FOUR comics, but I had read enough to know the general origins and premise.  The movie stays fairly accurate to the original series (some of the action sequences were taken directly from the original comic books), though some things have been altered to make the film more modern and dramatic (e.g. Doom's presence on Shield at the time of the "collision).  I was a little disappointed by the lack of action, but overall thought the movie was a good adaptation and a fairly exciting comic book action movie.  FANTASTIC FOUR might not quite be on par with SPIDERMAN, but it's a good opening film about a historic comic book fighting team.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Catch This Movie if You Can"></head><body><p>Being a stickler for realism, the coming attractions of this movie had no appeal for me as I beheld the boyish face Leonardo Decaprio in a Pan Am uniform of a first officer, knowing intimately that gray hair and a cane was almost a prerequisite for that airline's cockpit personnel. Imagine my surprise as the story came to TV and I found myself enjoying one scene after another.<br /><br />Decaprio plays, Frank Abagnale Jr., a modern day Ferdinand Waldo Demara, with a twist. He makes emotional attachments along the way as he starts conning and defrauding very early in life, at about the same time that his father and mother start to separate.<br /><br />Chasing Frank is a stuffy, Catholic, typical, white-shirted FBI Agent named Carl Hanratty who seems outwitted by his prey at every turn, as he comes up one step behind. Frank's greatest caper, along with passing forged Pan Am checks is puddle-jumping on other airlines while pretending to be a Pan Am pilot. Ever the ladies' man he meets stewardesses and hookers whom he cons as if it is was the most natural thing in the world. But our Frank isn't content with being a mere pilot.<br /><br />Faking diplomas from Harvard, he passes himself off as a doctor where he works in a hospital emergency room directing other interns to take care of the patients. Just to round out his curriculum vitae, he decides it would be nice to be a lawyer as he woos a prosecutor's daughter. With two weeks of study, he passes the bar exam in Louisiana. The only problem is that darned FBI agent Hanratty won't give up coming after him.<br /><br />He seems to be the perfect candidate for a psychopath. His happy home is broken by his father's financial and business misfortune, His mother leaves his father for the father's lawyer, and Frank takes pity on the father who thinks the government is after him for everything. It is obvious he worships a man who is a failure, but still does everything he can to gain his approval.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's direction is as upbeat as the movie's tempo and dialogue. The viewer may develop a fondness for the pursuer and the pursued. There is a happy ending for both of them.<br /><br />The real Frank Abagnale had a cameo appearance in this movie, playing one of the French police that captured Abignale in France.<br /><br />The End (almost)<br /><br />Sometimes real life turns out to be even more interesting than the fiction, and this was no different. I was more than interested in the man who reminded me of "The Great Imposter," Ferdinand Waldo Demara.<br /><br />The real Frank Abagnale Jr. made his first con against his father. He asked his father for a credit card so he could date the many women he admired. In order to get the cash, he used the card, told the garage to keep the batteries, sets of tires and gasoline, resell them, and give him cash.<br /><br />He served time in more jails than is shown in the movie. He served time in Sweden, six months in French jails and a few years in federal penitentiaries where he escaped from one pretending to be a prison inspector.<br /><br />In addition to being a "doctor" and "lawyer," Frank faked credentials to gain a teaching assistant job at Columbia University in New York.<br /><br />Frank's fortune changed after he was fired from one job after another when a background check revealed his prison record. He approached one bank with an offer. He would give them a lecture on detecting bank fraud. They wouldn't have to pay him if they didn't like it. If they did, they would pay him $500 AND tell other banks about his work. He ended up making millions.<br /><br />He currently lives and works in Tulsa, OK, and is still good friends with Special Agent Joe Shaye (known in the movie as Carl Hanratty).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Star Showcase For Joan Allen!"></head><body><p>The best thing about The Upside of Anger isn't the script or the direction, it's the impeccable performance by one of Hollywood's most serious actresses, Joan Allen. She simply is the reason to watch this irresistably funny dramedy. She carried this movie by showcasing her very best just like Annette Bening did in Being Julia. Kevin Costner is very funny and charming as Allen's romantic interest, and he did managed to put out the fire in her.<br /><br />Joan Allen played a middle-aged housewife with four daughters aged from teen to early twenties, and she learned or suspected that her husband had abandoned her and ran off with his Swedish secretary. She was devastated and naturally lost herself emotionally, and became very Angry at people. If something goes wrong, she'd lose her temper. Her relationships with her girls are rather volatile, and her only salvation was Vodka on the rocks with a lime wedge. She's seen drinking almost every scene for more than the first hour of the film. She no longer have any real feelings or respect for others as she became increasingly drunk, resentful, and angry. Then entered Kevin Costner, a former baseball-pro turned radio show host, was the one to turn things around for her.<br /><br />Well, it wasn't easy at first to please this angry woman. He was the only man who dared to get involved with her and it took some time for her to warm up to the idea of possible new love. Meanwhile, not managing her own temper, she's faced with responsibilities of her rebellious daughters who are driving her to the point of near nervous breakdown. She soon learned that it's not good trying to control others when she couldn't even control herself, and she must change and make amends before everyone walks out on her.....<br /><br />I enjoyed Joan Allen a great deal in Pleasantville, and this is her best work in recent years. It's obvious that the role is tailored made for her. She excels through moments of wit, anger, shock, and heartbreak. She stood out completely in the group scenes and generated a ton of laughs when she makes an @#$! of herself in even a formal situation. Those eyes with so much fire and judgemental towards other characters is so memorable to look at. Anyone with a mother like her will be guaranteed non-stop laughs.<br /><br />Kevin Costner did a great job playing a role that's kind of a spinoffs of his past baseball player roles. There was plenty of chemistry between Allen and him. The scene when he got into a fight with her after she declined on marriage proposal was great. He told her that he refused to be her bitch in their relationship, so it shows that she was the dominant force.<br /><br />The young and beautiful daughters are pretty good, and I think Erika Kristensen was more outstanding.<br /><br />Overall, the film  succeeds as a good family dramedy, but I was not pleased with the unexpected ending. It seemed like it was written that way so that Allen could have a heavy duty scene to display a breakdown.</p></body></html>

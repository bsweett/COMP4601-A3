Everytime I hear him listed as an Academy Award winner, I wish they had to say that it wasn't for his acting abilities.<p>Jennifer Garner as Electra is perfect. Colin Farrell as Bullseye is right on target (sorry, couldn't resist). The effects work is first rate.<p>This is the epitome of a popcorn movie. Just sit back, relax and enjoy it for what it is. As a translation of a comic to screen, it stands up fairly well. Unfortunately, the only thing that didn't translate from that two-dimensional world was Ben Affleck. The rest of the movie is exceptional.</p></body></html>

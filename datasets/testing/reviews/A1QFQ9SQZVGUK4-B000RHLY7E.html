<meta name="summary" content="Very shoddy sequel!"></head><body><p>The original House of 1000 Corpses was great because it was a celebration of Zombie's love for the horror genre. It also included such great camerawork and surrealistic colors and humor.<br /><br />This film was just a straight killer flick. Nothing fun or original from the 1st film was included.<br /><br />Karen Black? Gone. Replaced by an actress (most famous for the Police Academy films) who couldn't capture 1/5th of Black's mania or comedy.<br /><br />No mentions of Grandpa Firefly, Dr. Satan or The Professor.<br /><br />What a disappointment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Can I tell you something?? Capitalism is good."></head><body><p>Listen, the message in this movie is a great one.  Work hard and you will succeed.  I am shocked at how many people seem to think the only thing this movie promotes is earning money.  What about the dedication Chris displayed to his son?  What about the earning self-respect by finding something important and meaningful to do with your life.<br /><br />The only thing that bugged me about the movie was that it could have been a more honest portrayal of the real man.  He wasn't the saint that we see Will Smith portraying him to be.  People are flawed (I know I am, because I haven't found a man who will commit to me yet) and Chris Gardner or whatever his name is is not an exception.  He was honest about it in his book, but the movie makes him out to be this absolutely perfect angel.  What a crock.<br /><br />But all that said, to live a comfortable life we all have to earn money.  It makes the world go 'round and we all need it.  Period, end of story.  Chris made a lot of it and that doesn't guarantee him a happy life but it sure makes the journey smoother.  Shame on those who prefer socialism (i.e. - communism) to the brand of capitalism we practice here in the great United States.</p></body></html>

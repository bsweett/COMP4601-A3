<meta name="summary" content="EXCELLENT 2 DISCS SET! WELL PACED ACTION FILM WITH GOOD CHARACTERS!"></head><body><p>I saw this film a few years ago and decided to give it another look. While the film is contrived at times, it is helped greatly by a wonderfully cold performance by Tom Cruise. The film is well paced and builds slowly to an intense climax. Fox and Pickett should also be commended for turning in believable performances under crazy situations. The film probably rated a little over 4 stars, but the two discs DVD set is stellar and brings this super charged action film up to a top rating!</p></body></html>

Kazalski "Rock Expert" (New Orleans, LA) - See all my reviews<br /><br />Not quite as good as the first movie but it still holds you attention.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version is awesome. Time to cease product of low-def DVD's and go Hi-Def only starting now. Only a person with no standards would watch a low-def movie when Hi-Def is available.<br /><br />And now for mine: Only a person who likes to throw away money on Blu-Rays that come with no extras cannot be too smart.</p></body></html>

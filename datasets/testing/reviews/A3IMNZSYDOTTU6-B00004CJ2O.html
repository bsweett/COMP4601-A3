<meta name="summary" content="An Underrated Achiever...Jason Is Born..."></head><body><p>Many of us have been in those scenario's where you're watching a horror movie, and then we say "yep, I've already seen this." Well, FRIDAY THE 13TH might seem like one of those by-the-numbers slasher flicks. But in all reality, it's not. It's got a mind of its own, and director/producer Sean Cunningham had no idea he was going to make a movie that made more money than THE SHINING did, which came out that same year.<br /><br />FRIDAY THE 13TH takes place at Camp Crystal Lake, a place notorious for the drowning of a boy named Jason Voorhees. The student camp counselors are there for a weekend of fun and sex, sleaze and booze, but in all seriousness they are preparing for the kids who are due to arrive in just a few days. Little do they know there's a maniac on the loose who, one by one, dispatches with the young, hormone-driven population. But by the time the killer gets to Alice, the real killer is exposed. That's where the one fault lies...the killer explained her motives for killing off the sex-driven teens, and that gave Alice a chance to fight off Mrs. Voorhees, a mother who loved her son so much that she would lose her head for him, and she literally did. The ending of the movie is infamous, as many moviegoers and collectors alike fell for the "dream" sequence that flowed into the "real" ending of the film. Of course, that was one of the movies big strengths.<br /><br />This was one of the first movies to star Kevin Bacon, and his performance was bulletproof, even if his character's grim fate was not. Betsy Palmer originally didn't want to do this movie (she's not a movie buff by any means, and admitted that after this movie, she got more fan mail than any other film), but she did the movie to afford her car. Her performance is creepy, and she convinced me that she was out for revenge. Adrienne King was cast well as Alice, and her scenes of running and battling Mrs. Palmer were actually quite good. And of course, who can forget the dream sequence of "rain and blood"; the discordant violins that make up that all-too-chilling score by Manfriedi; and then the fact that Jason is not the killer in this movie, that's what really intrigued me about this movie. It was a smart move by Cunningham, and it really kept us in the dark until Mrs. Voorhees herself appeared on screen.<br /><br />FRIDAY THE 13TH is probably the best in the entire series, but it's not the only good one, although some of the series lacks the punch this one kick-started when it came out over 25 years ago. Grossing over $40 million dollars at the box office in America alone, FRIDAY THE 13TH is really the only entry casual moviegoers need bare witness to, unless you want to check out the sequels...but be warned...ch-ch-ch ka-ka-ka...</p></body></html>

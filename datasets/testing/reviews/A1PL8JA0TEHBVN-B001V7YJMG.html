<meta name="summary" content="A TRULY AMAZING FILM!!! DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE!!!"></head><body><p>This is miles ahead of the lame, saccharine, Mormonish, sexless, sanitized <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P5HRMI">Twilight</a>. This is the REAL thing. This is a little Swedish film that is years ahead anything made in Hollywood these days within the Vampire genre.<br /><br />Little Oskar lives in a small Swedish town. It's Winter and he is bullied at school. Until he meets Eli, a girl who befriends him and teaches him to make a stand against his enemies. In the meanwhile, they both experiment with love. Oh, and by the way, she is a vampire.<br /><br />This little film captures childhood or pre-puberty as few others do. And on top of that, the horror is so tasteful and well introduced that the viewer is constantly on the edge of his seat without the need for the cheap scares we see in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />It is amazing how this film captures a kind of Winter mood, as everything seems to stop and be confined to the indoors (while Oskar constantly keeps going to the playground in order to meet Eli). I also loved the cinematography.<br /><br />But it is the directing, the screenplay and the actors who shine in this film. I did not need the subtitles and it a shame if they do not translate the dialogs accurately, because everything here is beautifully written.<br /><br />Truly amazing! The Europeans have done it again! Hall? Sverige!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More Action Than Logic"></head><body><p>"Law Abiding Citizen"  follows Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler), an upstanding family man whose wife and daughter are brutally murdered during a home invasion.  When the killers are caught, hotshot Philadelphia prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is assigned to the case.  Nick offers one of the suspects a light sentence in exchange for testifying against the other.  Ten years later, the man who got away with murder is found dead and Clyde Shelton admits his guilt, issuing a warning to Nick: either fix the flawed justice system that failed his family or key players in the trial will die.<br /><br />The film addresses the weakness of the justice system while providing plenty of action.  I was never convinced that Shelton would be able to engineer the mayhem that he does from behind bars, but a sense of the believable doesn't seem to have been a priority for director F. Gary Gray.<br /><br />The movie is available in both DVD and Blu-ray.  Bonus extras include audio commentary by the producers, the featurette "The Justice of Law Abiding Citizen," a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie, and a mini-documentary on its special effects.  The Blu-ray edition contains both the theatrical and unrated versions.</p></body></html>

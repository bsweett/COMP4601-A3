<meta name="summary" content="Very good, very faithful adaptation of the book."></head><body><p>A film that manages to be faithful to a seemingly impossible-to-adapt book, "The Hours" features three of the best working actress in three different, haunting roles, but the film itself deals with how meaning, passion and happiness can be found in the moments of life moreso than in its overall fabric. <p>Nicole Kidman's work as Virginia Woolf is showy, devastating, romantic and remarkable, but it's Julianne Moore's take on a housewife's day of depression and disappointment that struck me the most.</p></body></html>

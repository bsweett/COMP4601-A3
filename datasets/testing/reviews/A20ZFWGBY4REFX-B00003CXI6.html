<meta name="summary" content="Shocking, yet very entertaining!!"></head><body><p>&quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; is a scarefest that will have you on the edge of your seat. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer gave great performances as Norman and Claire, the perfect couple leading the &quot;perfect&quot; life, until these ghostly apparitions start appearing in the house, etc. This film will send chills tingling down your back until the end. And also, you will never believe who the killer is in this movie!! But I will not say who he/she is until someone has rented or bought this movie. The extras for the DVD were exceptional. The pretty decent extra was the trailer for the film. But anyways, dont miss this film!!!</p></body></html>

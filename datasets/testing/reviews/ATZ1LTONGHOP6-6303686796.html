While driving around, he becomes obsessed with "cleaning the scum from the streets", and in particular, with saving a 12 year old prostitute (Jodie Foster).<br /><br />It's sometimes hard to remember that Robert DeNiro was once a serious actor and not a semi-comedian who has sunk to the level of self-parody. However, watching "Taxi Driver" makes you realize how DeNiro gained his reputation in the first place. It is DeNiro's performance that makes "Taxi Driver" and without it, this film would have been long forgotten. That's not to say that the script, directing and other acting aren't also great. It's just that, the focus of this film is on one man's descent into madness and obsession, and without a convincing actor in the lead role, this film would not have worked. The intensity of DeNiro's performance translates well into Binkle's own intensity in his crusade.<br /><br />"Taxi Driver" has a reputation for the levels of violence that it contains, but with the exception of the final 10 - 15 minutes, it is actually surpringly non-violent. Having said that, this is a very disturbing film. Watching DeNiro practice pointing a gun made me wonder if this is what mentally unstable killers are like just before they commit a crime, and it comes as no surprise to hear that this is the film that inspired John Hinckley to attempt to assassinate Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />This film well deserves it's place on many "greatest films" lists and hopefully it will continue to remain on such lists for many years to come.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another Pretty Good Chick Flick!!!"></head><body><p>As I've said before, I'm usually not a chick-flick guy. I'm more into horror, gore, and sick twisted comedy, but I watched this with my mom once, and it was pretty good. It has a lot of funny scenes and funny dialogue. It even has the legendary Andy Griffith in it. Jenna's husband Earl reminds me of Ronnie White from Rob Zombie's Halloween, and Doyle from Sling Blade. So, if you are a fan of comedy, pies, abuse, and Andy Griffith, then you'll love WAITRESS!</p></body></html>

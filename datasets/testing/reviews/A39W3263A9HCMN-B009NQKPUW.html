It's very pretty looking<br />2. It's better than the Phantom Menace<br /><br />Seriously. People keep comparing this to The Phantom Menace, and that's so unfair. It's easily better. For one it's prettier and there's some nice creepy characters. But ultimately, Prometheus is a movie so bad that I can only recommend it to people the same way I recommend The Phantom Menace: not at all.<br /><br />Before people tell me I didn't get this movie or I didn't grow up in the time the Alien was released: I actually grew up with these movies in my video collection. I like Alien, Aliens and Alien 3, but Alien Ressurection disappointed me greatly. And let's not even get started on those horrid Alien Vs. Predator movies- those movies are just plain insulting to both franchises. And sadly, so is Prometheus. Oh, and I got it just perfectly. It's too bad the film is just a steaming pile of crap, though.<br /><br />One thing I could imagine was that Ridley must have overheard his 5 year old grandson telling a friend a story when coming up with the idea for the film. Seriously. "And then a robot can see people's memories, and then they go to a planet, and there's a cave with all these coccoons, and then they find a head, then they bring it back to their ship, then they revive it, then it explodes, and then the robot puts alien blood in a guy's drink, and then the woman scientist has a baby in her tummy, and then she removes it from her stomach but it's not really a baby but an alien and then the guy turns into an alien, then they go to a cave, and then they meet a bald guy, and then the robot gets his head torn off, then the woman goes back to the ship, and then the alien from her tummy didn't die there and fights the bald guy that followed her..." seriously. As Peter Griffin says, "There, I just saved you two long and boobless hours!"<br /><br />In addition to such a ludicrous plot, There's also hideously bad acting- I typically love Noomi Rapace but she was abysmal. Not her fault, she is a Swede, so why make her a Brit? Charlize was just boring to watch and spoke all her lines in a similar fashion to Kristen Stewart. Shaw's boyfriend was bad too, and the only good performance was from Michael Fassbender. I felt sorry for him, watching him be the one good actor in a film riddled with bad performances.<br /><br />Then there's the dialogue. Dear lord. I swear for 10 minutes the dialogue consided of "Prometheus are you seeing this? Prometheus did you catch the image I just saw? Prometheus are you still following us?" I swear if I heard the word "Prometheus" one more time I was going to walk out of the cinema. And that horrid "I am your father" moment... UGH.<br /><br />Just avoid this film at all cost. It will ruin everything you love about the Alien movies.</p></body></html>

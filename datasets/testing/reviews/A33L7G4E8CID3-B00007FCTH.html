Through it we see the life of one Charles Foster Kane analyzed: a man doomed by his own ambition, corrupted by power and with love only for himself. We see the creation of Kane's behemoth news empire and how it destructed. This is the single best character study I have ever seen, and it really defined the genre. This is a movie you can watch dozens of times and see something new every time, it is also a funny film (I laughed more than a few times), and such innovative storytelling and camerawork. The acting is excellent, and the score is perfect, not melodramatic, like many scores for older films, but entirely appropriate. In conclusion, if you like a well-made classic film that will make you think, pick up a copy today.</p></body></html>

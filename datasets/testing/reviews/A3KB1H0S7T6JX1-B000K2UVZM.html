You gotta be kidding!<br /><br />The Black Dahlia was a bit of a disappointment due to the fact that it's too complicated and too confusing at times (actually most of the time), though by no means is it a bad movie.  It's one of those films where you cannot afford to let your guard down or else you're completely lost.<br /><br />The setting is Hollywood right after the end of WWII and a series of murders has two boxers-turned-cops looking for clues to solve the mystery.  Things, however, are not what they seem in the City of Angels...<br /><br />Josh Hartnett, Hilary Swank, Scarlett Johansson, Mia Kirshner, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.<br /><br />In short, the acting, the setting, the dialogues, and the music are all very good, while the plot would have been great if it wasn't so darn confusing.<br /><br />The film does bring L.A. Confidential to mind and even though it's not as good, it will provide for an evening's entertainment as long as you make sure you've taken care of anything and everything that might distract you prior to viewing the movie.</p></body></html>

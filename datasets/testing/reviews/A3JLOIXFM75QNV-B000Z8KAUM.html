<meta name="summary" content="Somewhat of a mess"></head><body><p>I loved the first one but was confused by the second until I rewatched it a few times. Ocean's 13 is even more confusing and I have NO desire to rewatch this mess of a film. The plot is just way too ridiculous and even more far fetched than the other two films. Also, I felt that the characters didn't really work as a team as in the other films. I just didn't feel like they gave it their all, and were just in it for another paycheck.<br /><br />Also, I found that the actual dvd quality was terrible. One of the worst I've ever seen. It just showed up extremely dark and saturated on my 46".<br /><br />There is absolutely no point in watching this film except if you like the actors in it. Other than that, the film is an utter confusing mess.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I love this movie I really do..."></head><body><p>But I can't stand how this is 2 sided dvd.  I thought it was Widescreen and Fullscreen, but yet it was side A and side B.  The viedo only had 1 casset, and this just pissed me off.  Getting that aside, this is one of the greatest mob movies ever made.  It explains how a kid hung arounnd a cabstand, and grew up to become a made gangster.  Ray Liotta(Henry Hill) did a real good job in the movie as the man, and a good job as the narrirator, Robet Deniro(Jimmy) delivers one of his greatest acts in his carrer as a man who did mob hits since he was 16.  And Joe Pessi(Tommy Diveto) deserved best supporting oscar for his role as a low temperd man who wouldn't take no ....  This movie shows three decades of the mafia, than began the good times, but ended in bad times.  This movie will keep your eyes glues to the screen to the very end.  Trust me, if you loved the godfather, there's no doubt in my mind you'll love this.  But don't buy the DVD like I did.  Avoid that mistake, and get the video.</p></body></html>

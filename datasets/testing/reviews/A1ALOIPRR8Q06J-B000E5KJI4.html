My main beef in addition to the theatrical release lacking any emotional depth or characters I cared about at all was that the story was stripped of its crucial mythological underpinnings. Where are the gods? Homer isn't meant to be real history. It'd be like if they did Lord of the Rings without magical wizards...instead Ian McKellen is an old hermit and there's no magical ring. They're just good northern European medieval people fighting an evil league of Roman Catholics, Turks, Middle Eastern peoples and Africans. Anyway. Yes they think Troy existed but that ain't the point of Homer and as far as realism goes (IF that's what they aimed for..) it didn't successfully flesh out ancient Greek life and war. I recall a scene of thousands of cgi spear carriers running across a field and feeling like you do when you're consciously watching a mundane "special effect", not something you feel real or compelling. Ex. of realistic type ancient battle is found here--> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FZJW7O">Braveheart Poster Movie 11x17 Mel Gibson Sophie Marceau Patrick McGoohan Catherine McCormack</a> and...here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FJH4X2">Rome: The Complete First Season</a>. This Troy movie is a pedestrian sword and sandal battle flick. The battles weren't exciting except for a moment when poor Hector must face Achilles.. you had to feel bad for the guy. Achilles himself came across as almost neurotic and whinny but I still didn't care for him. And I think Pitt is a solid actor. My 2 cents. I'd recommend the amazing Rome: The Complete Series for godless, metaphysical free truly gritty realism. You're in the streets with the plebs smelling the body odor and gagging on the overpowering aroma of the sewage and rotting things and you could get shanked, beaten and robbed or worse... and you're also brought into Machiavellian soap opera intrigues of wicked aristocrats. Heck check out the original Clash of the Titans for some good but unabashedly campy Olympian adventure story fun - Laurence Olivier as Zeus!</p></body></html>

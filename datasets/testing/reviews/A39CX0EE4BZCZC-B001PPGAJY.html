There are absolutely tons of stunning special effects, both visually and audibly. All of that means very few lulls in this 134-minute film.<br /><br />Having said that, I do think the film actually needed some lulls. At over two hours of pretty intense action, it needed more breaks. Either that, or shorten the story.<br /><br />Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, in her skin-tight outfit, is still a feast for us male eyes and Halle Berry and Famke Jannson aren't bad, either! Other familiar names from the first film are still here, such as Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Anna Pacquin and Ian McKellan.<br /><br />It's a pretty interesting story and  - all-in all,  if you liked the first film, you'll like this, (and you'll love the third installment!).</p></body></html>

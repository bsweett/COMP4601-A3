<meta name="summary" content="Overall a better film than the first"></head><body><p>This second Harry Potter outing is an overall better film than the first.  After some initial time spent with his adoptive Muggle parents, Harry escapes to his friend Ron's house, then makes his way to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for year two of his training.  But not all is well at the school - students are turning up petrified and the teachers are not able to stop it.  Therefore, it's up to Harry, Ron, and Hermione to save the day yet again!<p>The film is better for a number of reasons, not least of which being better source material.  Rowling's 2nd book is smoother and more cohesive, and this comes through in Kloves's screenplay.  Secondly, the children actors are more comfortable in their roles (and the actors playing the adults maintain their high quality).  Unfortunately, Harry himself, Daniel Radcliffe, still seems too standoffish and arrogant relative to his portrayal in the book.  I'm not sure if the blame for this lies with the actor or the director.<p>Thirdly, Director Columbus spends less time admiring the scenery and more time developing the story/characters.  That is not to say that the film is any less dense, but the camera doesn't linger too long, improving the pacing and interest in the story.  Finally, the new characters, including a scenery-chewing turn by Kenneth Branagh as a new prof, and the parents of Ron and Malfoy, are welcome additions to the Potter cast.<p>This DVD edition is likewise far superior to the first film.  Gone are the annoying little games you had to play to access the special features (the annoying games are still there, but they aren't requirements for accessing the goodies).  There are many (19, but mostly short) alternate/cut versions of scenes, an interview with Rowling herself on adapting her books to the screen, and other such extras.  Columbus does not grace us with a director's commentary this time, but I suspect it's unecessary because he covered much territory in the Philosopher's Stone commentary.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="When awful is not a strong enough word"></head><body><p>I rented this and what can I say? Well... you can't use that type of language here at Amazon but I'll just go with it...<br /><br />Awful acting? Check.<br /><br />Awful story? Check.<br /><br />Awful direction? Check.<br /><br />Awful villian? Check.<br /><br />Awful chemistry? Check.<br /><br />Awful ending? Check.<br /><br />To have this movie as a 3.5 star average and to even have ONE five star rating is a crime against God, humanity, and cinema... and maybe not in that order. If you are the brainless sort that finds Fear Factor to be "good television" then by all means, buy this NOW.</p></body></html>

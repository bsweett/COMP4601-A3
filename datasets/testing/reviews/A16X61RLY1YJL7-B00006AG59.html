<meta name="summary" content="The Mummy Returns - Pure entertainment!"></head><body><p>Where "The Mummy" was impressive "The Mummy Returns" is a highly impressive movie that is stunning and extraordinarily breathtaking in its non stop action, superb plot and innate comedy!  When director Stephen Sommers put "The Mummy" on the silver screen he set a very high standard for himself and those involved.  In "The Mummy Returns," he not only exceeds that standard, he raised the bar to an entirely new level that a third film will have a hard time measuring up to.  Given how magnificent the first two films are though, I'm sure that all involved will certainly raise the standards even higher should they decide to make a third movie.<p>Where "The Mummy" had "some" amazing CGI provided by ILM, "The Mummy Returns" is stuffed to the gills with their fine work!  To say that the CGI in this film was amazing is simply an understatement.  Adding to the allure of this movie is the fact that all of the actors from the first movie returned to reprise their respective rolls.  The ever beautiful Rachel Weisz and the adventurer Brendan Fraser are nothing less than spectacular in their roles.  Oded Fehr, having had a much smaller part in the first movie, easily steps up to the much larger role in this movie.<p>Of the many movies over the years that have attempted to portray ancient Egypt, this and the first movie are tops as far as their realism and overall feel of the movie, bringing the viewer "into" ancient Egypt through such highly detailed realism.<p>The premise:<p>We flashback five thousand years and see "The Rock" as The Scorpion King leading his armies across Egypt only to run into resounding defeat and the humiliation of being sent into the sacred desert of Ahm Shere to die along with what was left of his Army.  Seeking revenge upon those who defeated him, The Scorpion King offers Anubis, God of the underworld, his soul.  Anubis accepted the offer and gave The Scorpion King his Army...<p>It is now nine years after the events depicted in "The Mummy" and the Mummy, played perfectly by Arnold Vosloo is about to be resurrected by none other than a woman who appears to be Anck Su Namun, but without her spirit resurrected from the dead.  She plans to resurrect Imhotep and then he can bring back Anck Su Namun's spirit into her vassal.  They then plan to find The Scorpion King's resting place, defeat him and take control of the Army of Anubis and take over the world!  This is all a great plan of course, except for one small problem; the Bracelet of Anubis, which can lead them to The Scorpion King, has recently come into the possession of the O'Connell's.<p>What follows is as stated above, one of the best films to come out this millennium that combines intriguing Egyptology, non stop action, superb humor and a well matched cast to make it one of the most enjoyable and fun movies to watch.<p>I highly recommend this film and its predecessor as they're both extremely entertaining!  {ssintrepid}<p>Widescreen Collector's Edition Special Features:<p>- An Exclusive Conversation with The Rock<br />- Unlock the Secrets to "The Scorpion King:" DVD-ROM Link to the movie production<br />- Spotlight on Location:  The Making of "The Mummy Returns"<br />- Visual and Special Effects Formation<br />- Feature Commentary<br />- Outtakes - This is extraordinarily entertaining but too short.<br />- Live's "Forever May Not Be Long Enough"<br />- Egyptology 201<br />- Theatrical Trailer<br />- DVD-ROM Features:  "The Mummy" PC game demo and screen savers<br />- And several other special features...</p></body></html>

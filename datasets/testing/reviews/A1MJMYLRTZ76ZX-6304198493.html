<meta name="summary" content="A modern classic of film noir"></head><body><p>I happened to catch this film just by chance on a movie channel recently. I hadn't seen it again since it came out 10 years ago, but it was just as good the second time around. It's a dark mystery and thriller about what really amounts to the ultimate bogeyman--a criminal mastermind known as Kaiser Sose--a mysterious but quintessentially evil and nefarious criminal no one has ever seen but who seems to know everyone and everything that goes on in the criminal underworld. No matter how clever you are, he can outsmart you; no matter where you try to run or hide, he can find you (he seems to have spies everywhere), and no matter how bad or tough you are, he's badder and tougher. In short, he's like the seemingly invincible criminal masterminds one used to encounter in the old comic book stories, but reinvented in a more adult way in this very well done movie.<br /><br />If you like convoluted and twisted plots, this movie won't disappoint you either, and just that part of the movie practically takes Kaiser Sose's brainpower to follow and unravel, at least for me. :-) The script is terrific, and the acting by the entire cast is also superb. The drama and suspense build up from the opening scene to the final climax, where at least one of the mysteries is resolved--you finally learn who Kaiser Sose really is. Although Sose's omnipotent presence is felt during the entire movie, he's never actually identified until the last scene, although he does appear on screen. I would have never guessed who it finally turned out to be, but see if you can figure it out yourself. :-) Overall, still a fine movie that has held up very well and that I suspect is destined to become a classic of the film noir and detective/crime genre.</p></body></html>

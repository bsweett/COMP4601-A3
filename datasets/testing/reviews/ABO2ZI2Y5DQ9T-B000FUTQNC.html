<meta name="summary" content="Routine Thriller with Ford's Least Satisfying Performance"></head><body><p>Let's face it. Harrison Ford needs `Indiana Jones' right now. I don't care if Han Solo is now 63 years ago. Good actor is always good, and age does not matter. However, it is not a little shocking to see Harrison Ford in `Firewall,' who gives least satisfying acting in his career. Probably I am not the only one who thought he is not commited to the project, and his acting, lifeless and dull, is far from his best.<br /><br />In `Firewall,' Harrison Ford plays Jack Stanfield, security specialist working for a bank. His wife (Virginia Madsen) and his two children, however, are taken hostage and terrorized by a villain one Bill Cox (Paul Bettany sporting distinct British accent), who orders Jack to do what he says, Of course Bill wants the money, and does not come to Jack's house alone. He is with four armed baddies, all non-descript guys.<br /><br />[CLICH?-RIDDEN] This extreme situation has been used with some variations added to it (as in `Don't Say a Word') and though it ceased to be fresh long time ago, it could be still thrilling with clever twists. But `Firewall' misses all the chances, relying on a number of clich?s. Instead of writing about the predictable plans of Bill Cox, let's see a check list prepared for you: An ordinary American male with beautiful and understanding wife [check]; his daughter with I-Pod [check]; his son [check]; the son's disease [check]; a dog [check]; one villainous male with British accent [check]; four henchmen foolish enough to follow the ruthless leader without worrying about their own demise [check]; computer jargons and one laptop, two cell phones, and last-minute escape [check]. It goes on and on.<br /><br />Perhaps these familiar ideas might be tolerable if Harrison Ford had done a better job. Sorry, but he is not only miscast, but his vapid performance undermines all the efforts of the supporting actors, and the film lacks in both life-or-death thrills and emotional impact.<br /><br />I almost forgot to say that despite the title, the film's content has little to do with the computer security. `Firewall' shows you that the best defense against the hackers and imposters is traditional fisticuffs. And don't forget a dog. Believe me or not, `Firewall' proves that keeping a dog would be very helpful in case you meet these bumbling baddies in person.</p></body></html>

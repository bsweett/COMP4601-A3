<meta name="summary" content="Creative and wildly imaginative. Kind of scary too."></head><body><p>Wildly imaginative, intriguing, and delightful, Coraline is not a kid's film. It's an animated film for adults and it's dark in nature. To say that this film is creative wouldn't do it justice - Neil Geiman and Henry Selick have a vision beyond anything previously seen on the screen (although the opening sequence is very much an homage to The Nightmare Before Christmas and is reminiscent of Corpse's Btide). I can imagine rewatching this dark tale over and over and gaining something from it every single time.</p></body></html>

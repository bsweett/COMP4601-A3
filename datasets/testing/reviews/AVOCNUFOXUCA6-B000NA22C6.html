I liked that one better.<br /><br />The paper-thin story is derivative at best.  One of the story elements that I particularly don't care for is the Omniscient, Omnipotent Villain (OOV).  And the OOV is definitely a main feature of this film.  The "twist" is not particularly surprising, although it does show a bit of directorial flair absent from the remainder of the movie.  Further, the pacing of this movie, which I'm sure was characterized by the studio as "deliberate," descends beyond that into "tedious."<br /><br />The performances can't be faulted; they are all very good.  In particular, Johnny Depp carries this entire film on his shoulders.  I suspect this would have been a one-star film with anyone but Depp in the lead role.  However, great performances alone can't carry the entire weight of a movie, and this one collapses on the shaky foundation of its script.</p></body></html>

However, I'm always up for a well-made superhero movie, and Louis Leterrier's revision is quite entertaining to say the least. Growing up I never really followed the Hulk. His character just never interested me with the whole duality struggle between Bruce Banner and Hulk. Admittedly, if you think about it in the long run there could be some really good potential for some interesting theme exposition, but I've yet to actually witness it through the comics or other forms of media. This particular movie, however, is still very enjoyable as an action flick. You've got chases, drama, smashing, more drama, more chasing again, and finally an epic battle between two behemoths in the film's finale. I was very surprised at how well-choreographed all the action is. But because the majority of focus is on that action, I feel the movie falters a bit in character development. I like Edward Norton a lot. He's a great actor when given something good to work with. Unfortunately, they don't do much to build Bruce Banner as any kind of real character, other than what we see in the opening credits. I like how Banner was trying to suppress/control his Hulk self throughout the film, but it's always in spurts and they never really utilize that to convey anything to the narrative effectively enough. I remember hearing a rumor of a potential Director's Cut that was supposed to have 70 extras minutes of footage, but I don't know what happened. If Universal should ever decide to double-dip, though, I'd certainly consider it. The Incredible Hulk is a very good movie, and I'm anxious to see more cameos in future Marvel productions.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />Colors and flesh tones look outstanding, especially greens. I really like the cinematography at the beginning with the shots of Brazil and other landscape environments. CG integration of the Hulk and Abomination also looks seamlessly perfect. I didn't detect any signs debris or artifacts through my viewing, nor did I see any signs of image manipulation. There is a fine layer of grain to the photography, but I think it actually gives the film an extremely gritty look, which fits the thriller-esque nature very well. Contrast levels never falter, making all sorts of shades feel like you were right there in front of the camera yourself. Black levels are deep as well, and detail is particularly sharp. Everything from the blades of grass in the park to the wrinkles on Liv Tyler's pouty lips look.. incredible. This is easily the best the Hulk has ever looked in the film medium.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Universal presents The Incredible Hulk to us with a DTS-HD MA 5.1 track. And yes, to be clich&eacute;, you can take whatever Marvel superhero adjective you can think of and apply it right here -- incredible, amazing, spectacular, uncanny, fantastic. The sound design and audio placement is flawless. Directionality is very impressive during the action sequences; bullets, rockets, explosions, propellers, sonic cannons, roars, tearing metal, shattered earth; everything is perfectly placed throughout the entirety of the movie, and all with absolutely zero loss in dialogue quality. Speech, sound effects, and a surprisingly good soundtrack by Craig Armstrong are all as crisp and dynamic as you can get. And of course, LFEs are rightfully booming. The Hulk's and Abomination's thunderous footsteps will give your subs a thorough workout.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />As I mentioned before, I was never a big fan of the Hulk. But after watching the special features, I have to say I'm a little more intrigued now by the whole concept and central theme of "duality." I guess you could look at the Hulk as representing two sides of ourselves. You've got the normal, controlling, happy-go-lucky human side that we see in the mirror everyday that does his routine, wants to be happy, goes to work, comes home, and repeats. But inside, there's a part of us that's a bit of a savage, some kind of hedonist that, if fully unleashed, can amount to any kind of potentially destructive force controlled by rage or whatever kind of negative emotions we're keeping inside. Granted, this movie didn't emphasize it enough, but I wish it did. I also find it interesting that Norton almost turned the movie down, which I'm most certainly glad he didn't. Also of special note is the alternate opening, presented in full 1080p and with DTS-HD. It's a nice twist to start the movie with. It's just too bad they didn't make that Director's Cut that was rumored.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect. I really like Leterrier for Danny the Dog, and even a little for Transporter 2. Both were entertaining in their own respective rights, though I'd be lying if I said I didn't want The Incredible Hulk to carry over the same kind of writing/directing as his first effort. Regardless, though, The Incredible Hulk is still entertaining enough to make up for the loss in actual character development. With a reference A/V presentation and some pretty good explanatory features, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone of the comic book genre that's looking for a quick fix in action.</p></body></html>

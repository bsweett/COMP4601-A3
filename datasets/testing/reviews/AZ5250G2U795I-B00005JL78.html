<meta name="summary" content="One of the more interesting Sci fi's"></head><body><p>I will admit to not viewing this willingly:  My best friend is a rabid Tom Cruise fan, and insisted we rent it.  It wasn't bad, but could have used some changes or 'tweaking' to make it more interesting.<p>The use of technical elements was actually pretty cool.  I can actually envision some/most of these gadgets being in use in the not-so-distant future, and it was just cool to see a high tech movie not weighted down by the technese.  The personalized ads were also pretty cool as a plot device.  I did find the eyeball switching to be a bit contrived and a stretch to believe...but it didn't detract from the overall premise too much for me.<p>I do think that, had Spielberg's name not been attached to it, it probably would have registered a little lower on the overall critical scale.  One major problem with this movie is it could have benefitted largely from more editing:  you can lose 20 - 30 minutes of this movie and it would have flowed so much better!!!!<br />It got very draggy at certain points and, under a less-respected director/production team, critics would have made note of this.<p>This is a good movie, but bring your attention span.</p></body></html>

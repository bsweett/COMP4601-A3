<meta name="summary" content="Oh, Rats"></head><body><p>Rats! That is what the folks at Pixar threw at us for the delightful "Ratatouille," the anti-Willard of kids movies. Filmed in a sweeping style (the visions of Paris after dark are almost dreamlike in their beauty), the story of Remy, the Rat who would be Chef, is the kind of Disney "can-do" movie that they've been making for years. But this is easily the best they've done since the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MAO46">Toy Story.</a><br /><br />Remy has to overcome his upbringing and his species after he gets separated from his clan. A series of events leads him to Linguini, kitchen help at a famous but downtrodden French Restaurant. From there, Remy and Linguini form an alliance and taste success. But they still have a big obstacle to overcome, food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole, "Ratatouille's" only celebrity voice-casting). How they manage to warm his heart and save the day is fun and funny, only leaning into mean-spiritedness once or twice. (Unnecessary French bashing, Remy's Dad seems too simple a character).<br /><br />The animation is way beyond average. Remy is fluid and lifelike...conveying more with a shrug or shimmy than most live critters (including two legged ones). His ride down the stream is breathtaking, as are the visions of Paris. (For Purists: there's a disclaimer at the end of the movie that 100% Animation - not motion capture, etc - was used to create "Ratatouille.") The story of being who you are despite what others expect is positive, even coming from a hoard of Rats. What they have in "Ratatouille" that gets a bit different is that there isn't any stunt casting, the cast doesn't suddenly break into song, and the language doesn't revert into cliche of the day. It just starts a good story and follows it though to a happy ending. One you can watch with anyone, any age, and likely, for repeat servings.</p></body></html>

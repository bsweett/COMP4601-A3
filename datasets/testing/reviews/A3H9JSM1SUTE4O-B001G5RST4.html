<meta name="summary" content="TERRIFIC  ENTERTAINMENT -- GREAT VOICE WORK BY SACHA BARON COHEN"></head><body><p>The best DVD thing about MADAGASCAR besides the hip and funny zoo guys going  wild, the witty story, great character design, ultra-sharp wonderfully hued transfer and the cool commentary by the scene-stealing penguins is the absolutely brilliant voice work by Sacha Baron Cohen. Too bad he's not featured on the extras.<br /><br />If you missed this one and are looking for a riotous family film, all ages will laugh out loud and won't mind seeing it more than once.  The bar is raised very high.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

There is a lot to take in, but that is a good thing. It focusses on two men who wake up in an old change room/toilet chained to the plumbing.  But how did they get there.  It's all a puzzle, and I doubt any viewer could have seen the ending coming. Once again, very clever.<br /><br />SAW is the work of two Australian scripwriters, one of whom plays a lead role in the film. It was originally intended as a straight-to-video film but impressed the right people and gained a cinema run world-wide.  Rumoured to have been severely cut in places to enable a moderate rating, fans of the film will no doubt hope the DVD release features the full uncut version.  I will add that even the cut version is not for the squeamish.</p></body></html>

That was not enough for me to head to the theatre. I waited and rented the DVD instead. I really didn't see any reviews before I watched it, so I did not know what to expect.<br /><br />Well, the special effects did not disappoint, but they were not enough to carry this movie into the blockbuster area and my DVD collection. In this technology age, there are plenty of movies with special effects accessibility. But budgets can cut into the writer's script research. Special effects should enhance the believability of a movie script.  It should not try to carry a movie.  The movie must have at least a good plot. The Day After Tomorrow disappointed me in this must do area. Can we believe that global warming will dive us into the ice age within a week? (Days) Is an instant freeze within a hurricane like storm that rotates and then dissipates into nothing possible? Would this only affect North America?  This movie does nothing to answer any scientific questions. There are so many loopholes in this movie it could become a trivia question on How not to write a movie script. Can you count them?<br /><br />This movie's budget is all special effects.  If you want to see Los Angeles/Hollywood sign destroyed on purpose by tornadoes and New York in a hell freeze rent this DVD. I think there is a hidden message behind those chosen cities. Does Roland Emmerich hate the Hollywood scene? Or that New Yorkers are cold! Maybe.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Pixar masterpiece is given a fantastic HD Release!!!"></head><body><p>Pixar Animation Studios is without a doubt the best studio making movies right now. I love all their films and having to pick one as your favorite is a really tough decision that has to be done with some serious thinking. They're that good. Still, as fantastic as every Pixar film is, I've always have had a softer spot for The Incredibles and I have to call it my favorite Pixar film.<br /><br />Since its release in 2004, TI has been one of my favorite films of all time. The story is excellent, the characters are endearing, it's action packed and has amazing animation. Brad Bird really created a masterpiece. TI resonate in so many levels because it's not only a fantastic super hero film, it's also a fantastic film about family, relationships, and a lot more. It's really a very sophisticated movie that perhaps will entertain the adults more than the children but, as with every Pixar film, TI has a wide appeal and is high quality entertainment for everyone.<br /><br />At long last, Disney has released the film in Blu-Ray and what a release it is!!!<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />As with every Pixar film on Blu, it's no surprise that TI comes to HD looking absolutely demo-quality. The level of sharpness and detail is mesmerizing, colors are bright and blacks are balanced. Also, compression artifacts are nowhere to be found in the print. The DVD looked great for SD but looking TI on Blu is like watching it all over again and is a joy to do it. A fantastic transfer through and through.<br /><br />The audio features a 5.1 DTS-HD MA that will absolutely will knock you out!!! The sound is so clear, so vibrant that you will believe the crashings and the bangings are happening in your living room. Dialogue is also crystal clear. An absolutely excellent audio.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The 2-Disc Collector's edition DVD has a lot of insightful material that fortunately gets carried over to this 2-disc Blu-Ray which is chocked full of bonus goodies. Aside from all the DVD features (that include galleries, a making-of feauterette, trailers, character designs and much much more), The Incredibles BD has also some new material that will enhance your viewing. First and most important is the featurette "The Incredibles Revisited" which is a roundtable with Brad Bird and all the collaborators who did the picture. Is an excellent reminiscing piece with great anecdotes that will increase the love for the film. Also you got a PIP commentary on the excellent short "Jack-Jack Attack", a new interactive program about Syndrome's Island, Pixar anecdotes and the now customary Paths to Pixar featurette that in this time features the Story Artists. Also you got two audiocommentaries and the short "Bounding".<br /><br />This two BD set will leave you exhausted because is so full of material about the film that you will become an Incredibles expert. An excellent set all around.<br /><br />Aside from the two BDs, this set also contain a DVD and a Digital Copy.<br /><br />Sneak Peeks:<br />Only two Sneek Peaks are found in this set:<br /><br />Cars 2 (in theaters June 24)<br />The Lion King: Diamond Edition (On BD and DVD this Fall)<br /><br />Closing thoughts:<br /><br />The Incredibles is another example of how good Pixar is. It's a masterpiece and this new BD set, with amazing picture & sound and hours upon hours of bonus features, it's a must-own release. Completely recommended!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="2 1/2 Stars: This Bowl of Chili is Too Greasy"></head><body><p>Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is back after ten years and he is looking sleeker and sharkier than ever in his latest film, "Be Cool." Unfortunately, the entire film around him is flat and uninspired, except for a couple of scenes that make you wonder: what happened?<br />Most of the time, Travolta seems to be acting in a different film than his fellow actors. But when he connects: he connects big time as in his scenes with Edie (the glorious Uma Thurman):  his tango-mambo-Sergio Mendez-cha-cha-cha dancing scene with her is absolutely surreal and beautiful. Why/how did director F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job) go so astray?<br />Another gorgeous scene is Cristina Milian's (Linda Moon) singing onstage with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler. But other than these two scenes it is dullsville.<br />There are a couple of chuckles involving The Rock as a gay bodyguard/chauffeur to music mogul Raji (Vince Vaughn) but mostly this film inspires nothing but yawns. The question here is: with this cast how did so much go wrong?<br />First of all the pace is too slow, the editing is slack and boring and the writing is poor at best. Even Billy Wilder would have trouble putting this lame script across.<br />"Be Cool" could have been...but it just isn't.</p></body></html>

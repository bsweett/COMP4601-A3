<meta name="summary" content=""Evolution...""></head><body><p>Based on the heroes from Marvel comics, X-Men is a wonderful sci-fi film, which brings to the screen the struggle for supremacy between two rival groups of mutants while an undeclared state of war with the humans looms in the background.<br /><br />X2-X-Men United picks up where the first movie left off, with a mutant attempt against the US President leading to government countermeasures against the X-Men.<br /><br />Moreover, Wolverine is now closer than ever in finding out about his past, while more interesting characters also make their appearance.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen and Halle Berry (BOTH of whom are GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all out of this world!<br /><br />In short, X2-X-Men is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!</p></body></html>

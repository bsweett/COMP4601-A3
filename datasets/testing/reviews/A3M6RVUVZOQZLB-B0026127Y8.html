<meta name="summary" content=""Taken," but at 4 stars"></head><body><p>I usually enjoy movies like "Taken"--violence with purpose and edge-of-your- seat action--but this time, I was too aware that I was watching a movie, not experiencing the story, and unable to suspend my disbelief. Bottom line: Although the story is plausible (a slaver underworld run by "foreigners" is rife in Paris), I couldn't get past the fact that this was a movie.<br /><br />First, I appreciate that Liam Neesom had the opportunity to play this character. In an interview some years ago Denzel Washington explained his role in "Virtuosity." His son was a little embarrassed that HIS father had not performed in the role of an action figure, thus the film with Russell Crowe. I suspect Neesom had reasons, too, to step out of weighty roles into a vengeance seeker. And he is certainly allowed!<br /><br />However, here are things that took away from my 5-star commitment:<br />1. I'm sorry but Neesom is too old to do all the physical things he did. The viewer should have been given some clue that Neesom was still physically fit, e.g. working out in a gym, playing handball, something. Showing him wax nostalgic on his sofa over emotionally losing his daughter through years of job-related neglect made me think the opposite: uh-oh, couch potato in early retirement. Also, the tricky camera shots usually in a darkened atmosphere made it easy for a body double to do the stunt work in those one man against many fights.<br /><br />2. His daughter Kimmy was impossibly silly. I will leave it at that.<br /><br />3. The mother allowing two teenage girls to track a rock group across Europe was impossibly silly. What was the woman thinking? What world does she live in? Oh yeah, the world of the rich and pampered. I congratulate Neesom's character for not saying, I told you so, at the end. Justifiably, he could have!<br /><br />4. Where did that bag of fluids come from that he used on the poor girl he "took" out of slaving? I don't doubt that he has done that before (put in a drip), but how did he get it? Just one of those things he was carrying in his duffel bag? That seems really far-fetched.<br /><br />5. And the girl!! What happened to her? Does he just leave her? Note: I just learned that the girl is left at a safe house. Thank goodness!<br /><br />6. And the worst: When Neesom is finally caught and suspended from a pipe, how he escapes is really too much!<br /><br />7. Somehow I find it difficult to believe that even a retired "government worker" could leave Paris without being detained. There were too many dead bodies after Neesom rampaged through Paris. We know he didn't leave Paris without seeing some doctor. His arm was bandaged when he stepped off the plane.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are many believable points: totally devoting himself to salvaging his relationship with his daughter, saving the rock star and earning her undying gratitude, killing without remorse in the cause of rescuing his daughter, unflinching violent action when needed, forging ahead fearlessly. It's these kinds of things that make or break an action movie. Because of Liam Neesom's commanding presence and talent (not fully utilized in this movie), as well as the points listed in this paragraph, I DO recommend the film with a nod of acknowledgment to what I consider less than perfect components.<br /><br />New point: Kimmy didn't know the nature of her father's work, making their alienation caused by long-term absences more real. On the way to the airport, he told her he was a "preventer." By movie's end she saw exactly what he did--up close and personal--and had a new appreciation for her dad. That alone is worth the ticket price!</p></body></html>

Dark and brooding and kinda Clive Barker-flavored.  Truly astounding storyline.  Moving  & visually stunning.  Graphic & scary.  This is one of those movies where you go into the theater thinking it's about one thing and it winds up suprising you totally.  Definitely not for the kiddies although I would show i to my 16-year old daughter.  I think she'll get a kick out of it.  Great moviemaking!  Even though the entire movie is spoken in Spanish, that never detracted once andthat says alot.  When it comes to DVD, buy it immediately!<br /><br />DIG IT!!!!</p></body></html>

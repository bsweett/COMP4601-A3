For one thing i have to be truthfull the begining kind of sucks but it gets better twords the end. I personaly like these types of movies. Action and adventure. And some of the other reviewers are right you really can't compare this with Indiana Jones. This movie has it's one unique style of desert fun. Matthew McConahghey Does a really good job at his part as Dirk & Steven Zahn is hillarious. There is this one scene that will make you laugh your socks off. It is entertaining, When there is nothing else one. I recomend that you rent it first before you bye it. Just in case.<br /><br />Plot: Scouring The ocean Depths for treasure Dirk Pitt and his buddy al are having a time of thier lives hunting and searching for rare objects. Then one day dirk was snorkling for something and he came upon a woman who was in trouble. So he saved her and she was a doctor working for this company called W.H.O. who are trying to cure the african people from this deasie that is going around. But when this Man named Zahim found out what they are doing he wants the doctor and her partner killed. So Dirk and al end up helping the doctor with her search about finding this deaise. can they find out what is going on and save the day. You'll have to rent the movie and find out.<br /><br />If you liked the movie check out the book and soundtrack.</p></body></html>

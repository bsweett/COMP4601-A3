Ask any film buff what one of their favorite films are and this one always comes near the top. Winning multiple Oscars including Best Picture of 1965 "The Sound of Music" is one of the best movie musicals of all-time. Featuring Canadian-born Christopher Plummer in the role of a naval commander who is the widowed father of seven children, the film is equally known for its beautiful soundtrack and memorable songs. Based on the stage play of the same name, "The Sound of Music" is one of those rare films that has grossed over a billion dollars since it debut at the boxoffice. This particular DVD set comes with a slew of bonuses including behind the scenes featurettes and a splendid audio commentary by Julie Andrews herself. Both Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer recall the shooting of the film together and perhaps the greatest part about the bonuses is the beautiful reunion of all seven kids now adults discussing their memories on "The Sound of Music". It is wonderful that all seven actors still remain friends to this day. Lastly, there is an old screen test of a very young Mia Farrow who tried out for the part of the oldest child. Simply, you will enjoy the many multiple viewings you will have when buying this film. A film for the entire family.</p></body></html>

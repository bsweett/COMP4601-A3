I'm not talking about an adorable little Yorkie or even a cute but annoying Chihuahua; I'm talking about one great big mangy, mud-covered, tick-infested, shaggy mutt of a dog.  The whole story is ridiculous, the script is consistently groan-inducingly dreadful, and the acting is about as bad as I've seen in a long, long time.  Don't count on Angelina Jolie (in little more than a cameo) to bail this one out; it's way too far gone before she ever shows up.<br /><br />So what do we have here?  Well, in what is best described as some futuristic 1930s world (and how crazy does that sound?), there's some mad scientist sending legions of humongous robots to reek havoc all over the world.  It's like The Iron Giant was seduced by the dark side of the force and then cloned a bazillion times.  On the ground, we have the intrepid and incredibly annoying reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), who's on the story of several missing scientists when the giants attack.  Helpless authorities send out the equivalent of a bat signal to Sky Captain, aka Joe Sullivan (Jude Law).  This guy apparently spends all of his time flying in his P-40 just waiting for a call to save the world (and don't even get me started on the whole "gas mileage" issue).  As the story progresses, Perkins and Sky Captain team up to discover who is causing all of this mischief so they can track him down to his hidden lair and save the world.  In between aerial battles and visually incredible flying sequences, our two heroes constantly snipe at each other over their former love affair.  No matter how tense the action gets, or how few seconds the world is away from annihilation, these two always make the time to bicker like a couple of teenagers who just broke up.  The addition of Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie) aboard her top-secret flying platform somewhere over Asia only adds fuel to the extended lovers' spat.<br /><br />I won't even begin to describe all of the science fiction shenanigans writer-director Kerry Conran throws into this film (the words "everything but the kitchen sink" come to mind).  All of these special effects are, I suppose, the real selling point of the film.  They are - for the most part - quite impressive, and the whole movie certainly has a unique look and feel to it, what with basically everything but the prominent actors being a creation of CGI effects.  I'm sure the actors had quite a time performing all of their scenes in front of blue screens, but they never really had much of a chance given the mediocre script.  I have mentioned just how dreadful the dialogue in this film is, haven't I?  Conran doesn't just run a gag into the ground - he tunnels all the way through to China with it.  And it continues all the way through the final line; I really wanted to just slap somebody after this movie finally ended.<br /><br />As impressive as the CGI effects of this movie are, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow actually offers compelling evidence that CGI-created films such as this are not a good idea at all - I never bought into the idea that these characters were actually in the environment, and that necessarily prevented me from connecting to these characters at all.  Special effects do not a movie make.  I mean, a rose is pretty to look at, but I don't want to stare at one for over an hour and a half.  It really doesn't take very long for you to get used to the unusual look of this film, and after that point you're left with nothing more than bad actors delivering painful dialogue from a mediocre script.  My oohs and aahs were greatly outnumbered by my groans and "for Pete's sake" comments during the film.</p></body></html>

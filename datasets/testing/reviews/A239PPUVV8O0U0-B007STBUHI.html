<meta name="summary" content="The Definitive Shark Film (And the First Real Summer Blockbuster)"></head><body><p>From the first killing to John Williams' fantastic theme, there has yet to be a shark movie that combines suspense, action and drama. What makes this so much better than the sequels and recent movies that feature killer sharks (and I know other people have said this but not me) is that they don't show the shark until the movie's almost over! I mean, you know what's killing these people but you have no idea of the size of this thing until it pops up out of the water when Schieder's throwing the chum. I think all the horror/slasher films need to take a lesson from this; don't show the monster all the time because the people will never get scared. People are afraid of the unknown, so if you show people getting killed off but don't show who or what's doing it, then you'll get a bigger scare out of them when you do finally show it. Anyway, enough prattling on how good suspense should be done. Roy Schieder gives a great performance as Chief Brody. He's an average person thrust into this extraordinary situation. Robert Shaw is off his is rocker as Quint (a complete opposite compared to his role in From Russia with Love). And Richard Dreyfuss is down to Earth and believable as Hooper. All three actors have great chemistry together when they're on the boat. The shark, while not sleek looking by today's standards of special effects (God awful CGI would probably replace the model if this film gets remade and we'd probably see the shark every waking moment), is very believeable in its few moments on screen. And I think the shark roars or makes some weird sound when it busts through the boat right before Brody thrusts the air tank in its mouth. I might be wrong though.</p></body></html>

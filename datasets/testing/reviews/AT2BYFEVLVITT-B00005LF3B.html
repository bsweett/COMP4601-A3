<meta name="summary" content="Good, but could have been even better!"></head><body><p>After seeing this film my first thought at the end of the movie was, &quot;thats it&quot;. I thought it could have been a little longer to tell a better story. I'm not sure if it was the lack of dialog in the movie, or if my expectations were to high, but I was a little disappointed. I thought it could of been much better. Now, I'm not saying the movie is bad, its far from it, I'm just saying I was hoping for more. Tom Hanks gives an oscar worthy presentation once again, and its basically just him throughout the whole movie. I think that if film makers weren't constricted to how long they could make a movie, I think this would have been twice as long, that way they could of told a much better, in depth story. It felt like they cut corners in certain parts of the film, particularly with the ending.</p></body></html>

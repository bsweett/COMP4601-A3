Now, I'm not saying thats a bad thing, but I must say I was a little spoiled by the first two, specifically the last half hour of X-men 2, that was incredible film-making. We get alot of new characters, but not alot of background info on them, no real inter-action by any of them, and thats a shame, some of them could have been real cool to expand on. One reviewer said there was to much Halle Berry, um, no such thing my friend, she is still drop-dead gorgeous and one of the better actors in this trilogy. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is still cool as ever, and Magneto and Xavier are still a blast to watch.<br /><br />Now, the best part....As you may recall we lost Jean Grey at the end of 2, but good news, she's back, BIG TIME!!!! Problem is, she is sooooo powerfull she can't separate good from evil, and the battle scenes she has at the end are simply fantastic, if they decide to do a fourth, it would be wise to find a way to bring her back, definitely the coolest of all the X-men. Also, as mentioned earlier, there are tons of special effects, and most of them work, expertly shot with exceptional lighting really brings you head-on into the action, and Ratner uses it too perfection. Here's hoping for a fourth, but how about a little more character development. please?</p></body></html>

In that film, the film went way over the top and I was disappointed with the final result.  This time around, they get it right!  This film is a rip-roaring laugh riot!  The real star of this film is Sacha Baron Cohen's hillarious rendition of F-1 driver turned NASCAR speed demon.  He makes this film worth the price of admission!  This is for NASCAR fans and Non-NASCAR fans alike!</p></body></html>

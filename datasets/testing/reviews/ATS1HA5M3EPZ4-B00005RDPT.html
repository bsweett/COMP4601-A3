<meta name="summary" content="Clooney and company hit it big"></head><body><p>No major special affects, no grand CGI animation, no promise of a violent showdown between the protaganist and antagonist.  Ocean's Eleven is a tribute to simple film making that relies on characters, dialogue and pacing.<br /><br />Considering the cast, it's amazing they were able to make this movie.  George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia...where does it end?  If this was the NFL they would have broken the salary cap five times over.  I think the money they cart out at the end of the movie was their paychecks.  It was reported that George sent his buddy Julia a twenty dollar bill in his request for her to be in the movie.  The quote inside; `I hear you work for twenty these days'.  This kind of simple charm has worked it's way into the movie.  Clooney and director Steven Soderberg have created a masterful remake of the Rat Pack movie that is far superior to the original, which starred Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.  The 1960's version was widely known to be a stinker, so you may wonder why anyone would re-make a bomb?  Why ask why?  The new version is witty, quick and sharp as a ginsu.<br /><br />Everyone is in top form playing characters who are specialists in one way or another.  Don Cheadle is especially note worthy speaking with a British accent, playing an explosives and electronics expert.  Clooney's character, Danny Ocean, pulls together a group of professionals to pull off one of the biggest Las Vegas heists in history.  Timing and intelligence are key, as well as the delicate art of the con.<br /><br />The story unfolds however to reveal that Ocean's former wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) is now married to Terry Benedict, the man he is trying to con, and rob over 200 million dollars from.  He knows Terry doesn't care about Tess like he does and in the midst of the robbery, he proves it.  Don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything for you.  Trying to keep track of everything going on can be a little exhausting, but in the end, everything is made clear.  And if not, don't worry because you will want to watch the movie again.  I'm really looking foward to the sequel.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Eye Candy, But I Wanted Something More"></head><body><p>Probably I would be one of the minority reports here, but I should be honest. I didn't mind if Marie Antoinette is played by Kirsten Dunst speaking American English because I knew Sofia Coppola's revisionist biography is not a schoolteacher's lesson about history in France. And I liked the mixture of colorful costumes and modern pop music which is unique and imaginative (thanks to the photography of Lance Accord and costume designer Milena Canonero). But to me, Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" turned out unexpectedly boring especially during its second half of it even though it tells a story of a person who lived a very eventful life. Retelling a familiar story is a good thing, but when the new story bores you, that would be a big trouble.<br /><br />I won't repeat the life story of Marie Antoinette. The new film presents her as a more vivacious, playful, or often brave and vulnerable person than is generally supposed. Casting Kirsten Dunst is a success to achieve this goal, and her portrait of the Queen of France shows undercurrent loneliness and emptiness of her life in Versailles. Colorful costumes and pop numbers like Bow Wow Wow's `I Want Candy' perfectly match her image as a young woman living the life of unreality.<br /><br />Sadly, as in her previous `Lost in Translation,' Sofia Coppola fails to create and develop anything original out of the great materials she is given, except good acting from some of the cast and the gorgeous mood of the place. While the film traces the life story of Marie Antoinette and her relationships with Louis XVI, Louis XV and his mistress and her affair with Count Fersen, it never sheds light on the inner side of her enigmatic character which still intrigues us. Here Louis XVI is reduced to a shy and weak youth; Madame Du Barry a disreputable woman, and Count Fersen a hunky aristocrat. All these hackneyed characterizations only help make the persona of Marie Antoinette less credible and more melodramatic.<br /><br />Of course Sofia Coppola has a right to show her own vision, or what she wants us to see, and sorry, but having interested in Marie Antoinette, I expected more. This film is a real eye candy which is good, but if this is only about the gorgeous costume and hairstyle, what's the point of re-telling the story of this famous historical figure now?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Of Disney's All-Time Greats Looking Better & Better"></head><body><p>This was Walt Disney's first animated full-length movie. I've read where it took somewhere between two to five years to make, and the artwork still stands up to today's standards.<br /><br />t was good to see Disney releasing a nice Blu-Ray of this. It's pretty sharp and up to the Disney Blu-Ray standards. It makes a great movie all the more great. Not only is the picture improved, but so is the sound, and so is the regular DVD.....so you get a lot of bang for your buck here.<br /><br />The story is "cute" because of the seven dwarfs. The evil character - the queen - doesn't have that big a role so most of the time it's just a sweet, enjoyable film with nice characters. It's one of the those movies that makes you feel good as you are watching it.</p></body></html>

Thats the main fault I have with this film is that there really seems to be no reason what so ever to watch it.  No one speaks to one another, I mean I think Colin Farrell utters maybe five words in total (minus his narative scenes) and when he's spoken to he just stares at the person with this look of complete stupidity.  A breath of fresh air is newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher who plays her role so perfectly you can't help but love her as John Smith loved her.  FOr the most part shes the only part of this film worth watching...I mean, Malick has vision, it's just not right for this film which comes off more like a documentary then a motion picture.  I worry about the people who see the 3 hour version he's planning to release.  I mean, this movie dragged on for so long with nothing to keep you interested.  I fear for Colin's career because he keeps making BAD decitions, but at least in Alexander he had speaking lines.  Christopher Plummer was in all of five minutes of the movie and Christian Bale is a BORE!  Another bone I have to pick is the musical score which is played so loudly that it pounds you head and leaves you wanting to rip your ears off.  If there were a mute button this film would be beautiful, random shots of water in a brook and spiders on a tree and Colin Farrell kissing a newborn and  Q'Orianka Kilcher running around like a deer...it's beautiful...but with the repetative narrating, Smith lamenting over how he can't be around her and Bale lamenting over how Pocahntas won't love him the way she loves Smith...it's really annoying and the ending...OH GOD DON'T GET ME STARTED!  The end of this movie is just freaking RETARDED!  It just ends, just like that, like he ran out of film, I mean, he wasted so much of it on spiders and water and crap like that that he didn't have enough time to shot a decent ending to the film.  I think this film a waste of time and it actually made me want to get up and walk out and i don't normally want to do that and I think the ONLY reason I stayed was so I could actually write this review and feel like I knew what I was talking about.  I hope you won't waste your time like I did.</p></body></html>

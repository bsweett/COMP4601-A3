<meta name="summary" content="Ben Kingsley does it again ..."></head><body><p>WOW ... what a super movie .... the character development needed to make this pure and unadultrated tragedy work is delivered by the director and then some.... <p>As in any real tradgedy one can not help but identify with the main characters as they are dragged along by events and situations that are seemengly beyond the characters control. Any personality flaws or weaknesses are then magnified as we watch helpless to change the course of the tragic characters. <p>Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly bring in rock solid performances and I believe this is a must have DVD for your collection.</p></body></html>

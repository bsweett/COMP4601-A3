<meta name="summary" content="The Beginning of a Masterpiece Trilogy"></head><body><p>Since the 1972 release of "The Godfather", it has been hailed by many critics as one of the top ten greatest films ever made.  This film proved to be only the beginning in this triumphant history making.  It received ten Oscar nominations, winning only three (Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor [Marlon Brando refused]).  It's proceeded with two sequels that either match or beat the quality of the original.  While most film sequels don't match even closely to its original, this trilogy has stood against the test of time.  This film has since influenced many filmmakers that have since come.<br /><br />"The Godfather" follows the lives of the Corleone family, one who commits organized crime.  Vito Corleone, the family leader, is slowly losing his health due to old age.  His struggle to create peace within the rival families is growing harder because of major recent conflicts.  People are continually get murdered.  The Corleone family must protect and love one another more urgently to assure the safety.  Meanwhile, this follows the rising power of Michael Corleone, who becomes better known through the remaining trilogy.  The eyeopening series of events ready audiences for the triumphant sequel.<br /><br />Director and writer Francis Ford Coppola leads the cast and crew to create this amazing masterpiece.  He pays great homage to the novel of the same name written by Mario Puzo, who assisted in writing this screenplay.  The maintained emotional stance allows room to explore themes beyond organized crime.  Themes of family, love, protection, and italian pride fit wonderfully within the film.  Amazingly, this film doesn't portray the Corleone family as either good or evil.  Despite the crimes committed by them, the powerful stance never loses its edge.  Throughout, the film's passion that keeps audiences watching remains intact.<br /><br />The physical backgrounds give accurate and great additions to this film.  Through the buildings to the wardrobes, it feels like actual 1940's living.  The research proves revalent with its obvious hard work.  Its level of greatness presents itself as more than elaborate backgrounds.  Audiences can sense the individual themes through these physical beings, namely italian pride and organized crime.  The use of color and their tones matches well with the film.<br /><br />Everytime the music is heard, one thought arises to the listeners: "The Godfather".  The type of music is always played in the perfect scenes to match with the events.  Two versions of the main theme are presented: the orchestral and the italian-based.  It begins with a long trumpet solo, no instruments backing it.  Then it changes to the chorus played by the woodwinds.  Afterwards, it plays various melodies with various instruments.  Then the chorus repeats itself but more intensely and with string instruments.  The other songs also present themselves wonderfully, though not as well-known.<br /><br />"The Godfather" stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and John Cazale.  This amazing cast makes this film them much more powerful.  Audiences could not possible ask for better.  Pacino, Caan, and Duvall also received Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actor.  This is one of few times in Oscar history that three actors from the same film are nominated for the same catagory.  None are more deserving than these three with their fine performances.  Brando states his performance the heaviest by developing an old-man italian accent for his role as Vito Corleone.  His expressions match well with Vito's personality and his health/ emotions.<br /><br />Such tremendous film quality makes "The Godfather" deserving of its title as a classic.  This is sure to please many audiences for many more years.  Those who like this film should also watch the two sequels.  Those interested in them must watch this edition first.  Otherwise, the events will be confusing.</p></body></html>

A RARITY IN FILMS! 4 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>While 'The Book of Eli' will certainly seem familiar at times to those who remember 'The Road Warrior', 'The Book of Eli brings enough new to the table to carve out a nice spot for itself among other post-apocalyptic films. Denzel Washington is in top form here in this smart action film with a lot of heart and soul.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that I didn't see the end twist coming which is a rarity for me, especially considering the clues that are dropped throughout the film. Of course, it's easy to see once you've seen it. The film has a slick look with a very narrow color scheme giving it an almost sepia tone or black and white look at times. This is a good thing because it makes you focus on the story and not a lot of parlor tricks.<br /><br />I can not recommend this film enough for action fans who want a little more than explosions and senseless violence. The only reason I'm giving this 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 is that I thought the story wasn't all that original despite having some nice twists.</p></body></html>

If they weren't going to make a good film, then at least they would make a long one.<p>Not all of Troy is so bad.  The action sequences are entertaining.  Most of the visuals are pretty good.  OK, that's about it.  The rest is normal Hollywood summer film fodder.  Big stars in a low-substance film.  Pretty boys abound here so the ladies won't be disappointed.<p>Brad Pitt is, at best, a mediocre actor.  He scored big in 12 monkeys, but that was oh so long ago.  No one pouts better than him.  No one looks more handsome wielding a sword.  Still, don't look for Mr. Pitt around Oscar time.  <p>I'm pretty disappointed with Orlando Bloom.  The fact that he uses a bow and arrow in Troy doesn't separate him from his Legolas role does it?  This elf should try his hand at some serious roles and leave action behind for awhile.</p></body></html>

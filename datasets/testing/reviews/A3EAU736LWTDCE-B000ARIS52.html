<meta name="summary" content="ok, but it didn't knock my socks off like it did so many"></head><body><p>Did you guys know there was an invention a few years ago called color television?  So what if it is a comic strip? Did you know its cheaper to make a movie in black and white? Quentin Tarantino is laughing all the way to the bank on this one, and don't give me the "he was experimenting, trying to make a comic book, made a revolutionary new idea" statement. The old 70's spider man series did this concept ages ago.<br /><br />Anyway. Some of the mini stories are interesting, some where silly or boring. I am not a big KillBill fan either. I like Quentin Tarantino when he does stuff like "from dusk till dawn"<br /><br />Sin city might be worth watching once, but I would not see it again. Loved the violence though :)</p></body></html>

In ddition to the Oscar winning performance of Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf, the entire cast is impeccable:  Stephen Dildane as Woolf's devoted husband is mesmerizing; Meryl the Magnificent Streep once again shines as an editor throwing a party for her dying writer friend (an extraordinary Ed Harris); Julianne Moore is riveting as the depressed housewife who chooses suicide as an escape route, and what a supporting cast;  Toni Collette, Claire Danes, John C. Reilly, Miranda Richardson, Jeff Daniels, Allison Janney.  They are all brilliant in a film that is compelling in its expert weaving of how these three women's lives are so parallelled.  The editing of the film is outstanding as well, the gorgeous score by Phillip Glass; Stephen Daldry's emotional direction.  All come together to bring a movie of unusual depth and sensitivity.  While certainly not a "feel good " kind of movie, THE HOURS IS nonetheless absorbing film viewing.</p></body></html>

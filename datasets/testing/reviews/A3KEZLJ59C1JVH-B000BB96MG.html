<meta name="summary" content="A solid remake of a classic story"></head><body><p>Tim Burton did an excellent job remaking "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." The film stays pretty close to Roald Dahl's book and the original movie adaptation, although there's this weird thing at the end regarding Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) father and the whole issue of family. Overall, though, I was impressed with this movie. The special effects are excellent, and the children are all hilarious and perfectly cast. (I especially loved watching Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket...that kid is so adorable!) The Oompa-Loompas are spectacular...they were all digitally multiplied and portrayed by the same actor, Deep Roy, who is very funny.<br /><br />Some people have criticized Depp's performance as Wonka, but I think it was brilliant. He really made the role his own by building upon the quirkiness of the character, which resulted in a fresh interpretation of the role that is drastically different from Gene Wilder's version of Willy Wonka, but not at all bad. I also loved the way that Willy Wonka's skin was the same grayish color of a human cadaver...that's Tim Burton for you! It really added to the overall creepiness of the movie.<br /><br />This is a very good film and is one of the best remakes to come out of Hollywood in some time.</p></body></html>

I don't know about you but I've just about had enough of cliff hangers or giant efforts to make evil industructable to the point of getting numb as a viewer not knowing what to believe. This movie (D9) ignores the stereo typical ideas for sci-fi and gives me a sense of hope that no matter what sometimes the right champion emerges against all odds. On one hand it is shameful the producer drops the name 'Lord of the Rings' as part of his work, because D9 isn't even in the same league by any definition - not anywhere even close. But it is great to see some body count happening where it should and for what little budget there was obviously used (not used), I'd still recommend this movie for die-hard sci-fi fans. Not because it is fantastic, but because crawfish prawns deserve to be heard. The unlikely alliance formed is laughable but still a great idea to base the story's plot upon nonetheless. The armored suit machine had my attention, and I couldn't help but realize I need one of those myself in real life for about a week or two (hee hee hee hee). Don't spend big bucks on this movie - get it used, single disc edition, and that way you can still enjoy it. I'm grateful Amazon dot com has those kind of options and such a variety of reviews. BTW there's no female nudity so up front you're getting told here that the R rating is for language and violence. Good movie worth watching, even if I didn't recognize any superstar actors or actresses.</p></body></html>

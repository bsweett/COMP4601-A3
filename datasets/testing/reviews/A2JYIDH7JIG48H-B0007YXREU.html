To give you an idea of the type of humor, it's fair to compare it to Mike Myer's Austin Powers movies.  If you liked Austin Powers, you'll probably like Team America, but it's not for kids or seniors - or normal people.  It has about an order of magnitude more filthy language and sexual humor, not just inuendo.  Yes, much of the humor is sophomoric (perverse and repulsive), but there is also much very funny satire, and the whole thing is ridiculous because they're just puppets, and that made me and the whole audience laugh as much as anything.  Much has been written about the film being homophobic; that's just nonsense, propaganda put out by Hollywood types who are offended by the very funny satire poking fun (violently) at the puppet versions of their friends Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Matt Damon and others.  The movie also lampoons right-wing secret government agencies, and the whole homophobic thing is about homosexual acts of the head of the agency - to me it seemed pro-gay.  At any rate, the movie's offensive to everyone, and if you can stomach it, it's a riot.</p></body></html>

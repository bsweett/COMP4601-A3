<meta name="summary" content="All works very well for them until they decide to crash the wedding of weddings."></head><body><p>The Frat-Pack, are surely the hardest working collective in Hollywood. Hardly a couple of month's goes by without a movie featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, or those Wilson boys Luke and Owen being released. When Starsky and Hutch paired Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller it was good, when Dodge ball put Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller it was better, but "Wedding Crashers" could well be the finest Frat-Pack pairing to date.<br /><br />Although Wilson and Vaughn have appeared in four movies together so far, this is the first where they've both taken star billing. "Wedding Crashers" is at times formulaic, the comic performances raise this movie above par and in lesser hands the main characters could have descended into Rom-Com clich&eacute;. The fast-talking machine-gun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson's laconic style. Their single-guy banter's often painfully accurate, as is the acknowledgement they're both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic set-pieces too, notably the divorce meeting, the weddings montage, the cringe-worthy football game and the hunting trip.<br /><br />The supporting cast are also an asset, Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable, while Rachel McAdams' 'Claire' has a charming vulnerability and an easy-to-fall-in love with quality. Former "Home and Away" pin-up Isla Fisher however, is less convincing.<br /><br />I admit "Wedding Crashers" is far from perfect, at time situations seem too contrived, the nudity is laughably gratuitous, and Claire's evil fianc&eacute;e Sack (Bradley Cooper) is an almost too heavy-handed device to make Wilson look good.<br /><br />But if you can look past all that, and simply accept it for what it is, you're left with a very funny film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="AWESOME MUSICAL"></head><body><p>For fans of the movie musical, and everyone else for that matter, this movie is a gift!  Featuring most of the sensational Kander-Ebb numbers from the Fosse Broadway show, but presented with the fresh imagination of director Ronb Marshall, this movie is non-stop, gleefully sinful fun.  And the performers really shine, most of all Renee Zellwegger, who is a brilliant choice to play Roxie Hart.  Catherine Zeta-Jones literally slithers across the screen, and who knew Richard Gere was such a terrific tap dancer?  Concerned much more with fame and the spotlight than with the means it takes to gets there, this movie's heroines have more than a small chip on their shoulder; they are basically a collection of killers.  You will find it hard not to applaud each and every number; the music is infectious, non-stop and expertly arranged and performed.  Chica-GO!</p></body></html>

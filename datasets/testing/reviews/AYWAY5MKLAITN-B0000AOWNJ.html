With the aid of two chatty teenage girls we find out that there is a specific VCR Tape that has the ability, when watched, to kill the viewer in seven days. Even more, the ghost who posses the tape will call the viewer up at their home to verify that they indeed have seven days left to live. What follows is a reporter who is quickly tracking down the myth of the mysterious tape. But, for reporters, the only way to break the myth is to see what all the fuss is about. She finds the tape at a lodging place and watches it. Sure enough, it's real. Now, before her time is out, she has to unravel the mystery of the killer tape using only the footage and her resources. Wierd things start happening: Distorted images, nightmares, signs, and ghostly otherworldly images.<br /><br />A tense Mystery/Horror that disturbs the mind as well as the senses. It's a movie that hitchcok would be proud of.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

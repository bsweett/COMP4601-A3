Never quite knowing for what to expect. Nor when. "Lady in the water" containing these necassary ingredients. The locations rarely change, the contrasts focused on good and evil. Sympathetic characters we identify with, the drama. But then it is the main creature. A narf. From a world we don't understand or recognize. And do we feel wiser after watching the movie?<br /><br />Speaking for myself, well, no. I actually found myself thinking meanwhile watching the latest movie of one of my favorite directors/writers -this was intended on his children? No wonder if they fell asleep then. Because first time I watched so did I. I've now seen it twice since that. I don't hate it. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen. And I still have faith in Shyamalan as a director of future entertaining-releases. I just hope he doesn't try with a sequel on this. To me, the ending being the ending was what surprised me. Good acting as a plus though.</p></body></html>

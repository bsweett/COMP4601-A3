<meta name="summary" content="Late Night Flight"></head><body><p>"Red Eye" was a snappy summer surprise, a tightly-written and gore-free thriller from the unlikeliest of directors, horror maven Wes Craven. Like the film that followed it, "Flightplan" with Jodie Foster, "Red Eye" pits a resourceful hero (Rachel McAdams) against foul villainy in a plane at 30,000 feet. A little girl, a helpful man and flight attendants play pivotal parts in both pictures. And both women ultimately triumph combining superior intelligence with physical prowess. Foster knows her way around a psychological thriller, but for Craven, principal of Slasher High, this is new territory.<br /><br />His fluid camera, relentless pace and acute take on the genre pay off in performance, even in the supporting roles. Boyish Irish actor Cillian Murphy has a dreamy jawline and is charming until his close-up (those chill blue eyes.) McAdams looks lovely but too young to be managing a luxury hotel. No matter; both nail their characters with economy and suspend any disbelief. Seasoned pro Brian Cox, as her father, comes to the rescue. Surprise and suspense are as elevated in "Red Eye" as the big studio-built airliner. If Craven finds another cast and script as savvy as these, a new career awaits him.</p></body></html>

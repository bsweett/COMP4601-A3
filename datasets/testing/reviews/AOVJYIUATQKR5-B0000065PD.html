May 27, 2003<br />Guess I didn't like the bad guy and the fact that he seems to be a Michael Jackson imitation, in the worse sense, and surrounded himself with children. If you can get past that this would get 5 stars from me.  Also, It is a movie I can watch with my 12 year son and my 20 year sons. My 6 and 10 year old daughters didn't like it though and they like anything starring "Jack Burton".<p>The new TV show based on this movie is also worth a look.</p></body></html>

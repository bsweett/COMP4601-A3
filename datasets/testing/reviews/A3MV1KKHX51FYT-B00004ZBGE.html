They see a craft near the beach, soldiers arrive to pull the craft ashore. "Open it up." Three travelers step out and remove their helmets! The visitors are locked in the zoo infirmary. We hear their explanation of events. "Don't take any chances." The female is tested and shocks the examiners. Something bad happens to a visitor. "We mean you no harm." There is another shocking statement! "I like you." The news shocks the scientists. The Presidential Commission meets to learn the facts. They speak the language of their ancestors. They come from a distant planet system. "We came from your future." The audience applauds. What did they see destroyed? They can't tell all the facts.<br /><br />Cornelius and Zira are taken to a hotel and shops in Los Angeles. They are shown the sights (like Disneyland). Zira speaks out. "Beastly" says Cornelius. Zira faints. "Grape juice plus." "In vino veritas"? What about the future? "Convince me." Can we alter the future? There is a philosophical discussion about the two apes. The Presidential Commission makes a decision - they will go to Camp 11 and be questioned. How did apes arise? It began with a great plague. Apes are smarter than dogs and cats. After a few centuries they learned to change their conditions. They want to give a drug to Zira and then question her. They did it for "science". Experimental surgery on humans? Will the apes be "humanely destroyed"? Or will they escape? Can they find a refuge? Yes, and Zira gives birth to Milo. The search is on for the two apes. Armando says farewell. They can hide on an abandoned ship. Lewis gives Cornelius a revolver "just in case".<br /><br />The scientists talk about problems like the population explosion or the threat of nuclear war. They find the clothes of Zira by an oil well. They search the area. The scientist who wants to kill the pair approaches their hide-out noisily. Other armed men arrive. There is a shoot-out. [Who are the savages?]And so their story ends. There is one last surprise. "Mama."<br /><br />This is a lower budget film that is part satire and part adventure. It is not too dramatic, as if the story had to be toned down. Think of the implications if the lower classes forgot their place and showed they were equal to the rulers of society. That could mean liberty and justice for all.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3.5; like the book, entertaining to a fault"></head><body><p>The Da Vinci Code, written by Dan Brown, was one of those books that became a blockbuster but partly for the wrong reasons. While it was indeed a good read, the main selling point was its tackling of religious issues, especially dealing with the legend of the Holy Grail and what it actually is. Naturally a film version was in order and who do we get to adapt this mega-hit? None other than Ron Howard, director of Backdraft, Apollo 13 and a Beautiful Mind, with the film being adapted by Akiva Goldsman(ugh). Is it as bad as the critics said it was? Not quite but it's definately a massively missed opportunity.<br /><br />Robert Langdon, a symbologist and professor is called into to oversee a body murdered in the Louvre: a naked old man who mutilated a pentagram onto himself and left some clues. Of course, the police believe he's guilty of it so he has to team up with crytologist Sophie Neveu to solve the riddle of one of the most well-guarded secrets(well, in fantasy land anyway) in history. Chasing them is Silas, an albino monk prone to self-flagellation, a corrupt Bishop and an elusive character known as the Teacher.<br /><br />Having conversations with a friend of mine is always a minefield because she hates swearing and sometimes I tend to become a sailor. In many ways that's exactly how people reacted to this film: overdoing it. It's a book, it's not an expose piece a la CNN debunking an entire religion, it's fiction, same way an author might talk of an apocalyptic world despite the fact we still have airplanes and malls and ice cream parlors. That's your basic mindset upon first reading the book: don't believe everything. With the movie? Same thing but don't think you're going to watch a great movie. In fact that's where the film drops the ball: what should've been a great entertaining film is merely a serviceable adaptation but missing key things. For one: the film's just not exciting. I literally finished the book in one night cause it was so engrossing. Here, it's like once is enough. Second: the film feels rushed as if you can easily digest all the massive amounts of exposition on the go. That's why the book worked: I can re-read all the sections about Christian history: here's it's just whoosh!<br /><br />How's the casting? Ironically, I couldn't think of anyone else(besides Hugh Jackman maybe) to play Robert Langdon than Tom Hanks but he almost sleepwalks at times though it's probably not his fault. Knowing he had a blockbuster on his hands, Howard probably just rushed through his takes. And what better actress(and adorable one too) to play Sophie than Audrey Tautou of Amelie fame? Then of course there's scene-stealer Ian McKellan and creepy Paul Bettany as Leigh Teabing and Silas respectively. But as I said, some of it seems very first-take stuff. What helps the film is the added visuals to help with the clue solving. Letters appear brightened, flashbacks are used and in my favorite segment, a computer teaching tool is used for the Last Supper. It makes the film very similar to National Treasure and regardless of your feelings on the plot, this kind of stuff is always fascinating.<br /><br />How's the special features? It felt very studio-sanctioned stuff. This, along with the Matrix, can play host to numerous commentaries from Director and Cast and Crew to Dan Brown himself to even scholars to debunk Brown's conclusions or even support theories. No such thing. The stuff that is in here feels very surface-skimming as if the studio said "okay, 5 minutes is enough on this segment, next!" Whatever happened to documentaries like Episode I's the Beginning or the Appendices from Lord of the Rings?<br /><br />If you're a big fan of the book, of course I'd recommend it since it makes the stuff from the book cooler but if you're ultra-Catholic than stay away. Those looking for thrillers be warned while those looking for good escapism of pretty much found it with this one.</p></body></html>

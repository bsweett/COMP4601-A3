Only running into a couple of stinkers here and there like "The Mist", but this year I get "No Country For Old Men", "There Will Be Blood", and now Juno. This is the sweetest, smartest comedy/love story I've seen in...I don't know how long. Awesome soundtrack, great actors, just great great great. If you didn't like this movie just a little, you are a sad, sad, retarded person with severe taste deficiencies, and you probably like to project your own sorry life onto the characters and criticize them for their choices, just like you do with every other movie you watch. Oh, well. The rest of us will enjoy it for you.</p></body></html>

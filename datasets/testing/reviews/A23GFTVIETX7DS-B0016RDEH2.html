<meta name="summary" content="A Haunting Tale of Lost Innocence and Brutality"></head><body><p>Billed as a "fairy tale for adults," del Toro's brilliant depiction of the brutal aftermath of the Spanish Civil War through a fantastical tale of fauns, quests, and a lost princess is far more moving than a straightforward account could ever be.  Bookish, creative Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) finds herself at a remote military outpost when her pregnant mother marries the cruel commander, Captain Vidal.  Ofelia finds herself amidst men who don't hesitate to torture and kill and rebels who are willing to sacrifice their own lives for freedom.  The Captain sees Ofelia as a disposable appendage of her mother, and her mother, suffering from pregnancy complications, cannot care for her.  As Ofelia meets a insect-like fairy and a faun (Pan, in the English translation), she descends into a fantastical world that is every bit as dark as the one in the outpost.<br /><br />Through these two parallel worlds, del Toro manages to offer hope where there is none, and freedom in an unescapable situation. The relationship between the Captain's servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL57">Y Tu Mama Tambien</a>) and Ofelia is poignant as the two find refuge in a surrogate mother/daughter bond.  The chemistry between the two actresses is palpable and believable; without it, the connection between the real and the fantasy worlds would not have succeeded.<br /><br />Viewers who like more traditional methods of storytelling will likely be disappointed, as this film is darkly bizarre, with much ambiguity.  Those who like unusual foreign films (and don't mind reading subtitles) will embrace this twisted tale of a child abandoned in an unforgiving world.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></body></html>

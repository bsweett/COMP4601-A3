<meta name="summary" content="I Liked It"></head><body><p>True, the story line is a bit far fetched, the movie dove into the plot with confusing speed, and some things (such as the wolves) were predictable . . . Still I liked it.  "The Day After Tomorrow" passed my prime tests for a film even if it doesn't stand up well as a social statement.  Then again, I wasn't in the mood for a social statement when I watched it.<br /><br />Test #1  It kept me glued to my seat.  The action came with enough speed that I didn't want to slip out for popcorn for fear I would miss something.  I wasn't watching my clock, and when the movie was over I didn't feel as if I'd wasted the evening.<br /><br />Test #2  Although much of it was a formula film, just enough was different that I didn't feel like I was watching a remake of something I've already seen before.<br /><br />Test #3  The next day I would have been willing to watch it again with another member of my family.<br /><br />Test #4  I could actually imagine someone adding it to their DVD collection.<br /><br />So what if it doesn't seem realistic (like most of Hollywood makes sense???).  This film is a keeper.</p></body></html>

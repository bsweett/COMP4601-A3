<meta name="summary" content="Mystic river"></head><body><p>Mystic River was the first movie that I have ever watched that was directed from Clint Eastwood, and I am happy to say that it was worth the time.<br /><br />Mystic River is very sad, and rather depressing. If you've ever watched the Sleepers, then you'll understand when I say that Mystic River was exactly like that one. Except this time Kevin Bacon was on the right side of the law.<br /><br />The ending did nothing in making the film lighter or more joyous, instead, it left me even more sad than when the movie began. Not the best way in ending a movie, but thats life I guess, not everything is going to turn out for the better. Still, I couldn't help but wonder if things could have turned out  better, and what would have happened instead if such a thing was possible.</p></body></html>

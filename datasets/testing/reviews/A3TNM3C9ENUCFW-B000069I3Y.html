<meta name="summary" content="Should Have Been Better"></head><body><p>This is a great idea for a movie, and much more than a "switchover" story, in which we meet two completely different individuals whose live become intertwined after a car accident. , but Affleck & Jackson are certainly not small names these days, and although I'm sure many people will disagree, do their best to pad out a pretty lame script, one has to say.<br />This is a story of morals, and certainly trys to deliver a message, after one simple event forces each of the main characters to study, and ultimately reassess their lives. For me this movie however, fell a bit flat - I kept expecting something much more than I saw, and the ending seemed as if the Director had run out of ideas, and had to go with the "off the shelf" crowd pleaser finale. I wouldn't say that this movie was a waste of talent, or particularly bad. It's just true that a book cannot be judged by it's cover, anymore than a movie can be judged by it's cast. A struggle to get to 3 Stars.</p></body></html>

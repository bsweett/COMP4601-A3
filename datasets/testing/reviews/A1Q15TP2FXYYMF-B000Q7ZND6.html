<meta name="summary" content="A Long Anti-Smoking Commercial"></head><body><p>The story is simple; self-centered John Constantine: Hellblazer (Keanu Reeves) did a "no no" in his youth ensuring him a place in the underworld and to compound the problem he is to be short lived due to a smoking habit.<br /><br />Mean time he, due to his accident he has the ability to see angles and demons. Even though he is conceited and knows where he will be going he still finds time to do some good for mankind and in the process send a few demons back where they came from.<br /><br />Something has gone horribly wrong with the balance. And with the aid of his young sidekick and a medium that is well done by (Rachel Weisz) he intends to get to the nature of the problem.<br /><br />The character of Constantine comes from the DC comic world and has been modified a tad to fit a movie with a beginning middle and end.<br /><br />I could not help but notice Tilda Swinton who played Gabriel. She made you feel that you were watching a first class movie.<br /><br />The only redeeming feature of value of the movie is not the movie its self but the audio track that explains wheat they are trying to do in the making of the movie. In fact you could just bypass the movie and listen to the voice over audio instead and save yourself two hours.<br /><br />I think I should have watched the two disk version as even with the audio track they refer to many things that are not in the movie.</p></body></html>

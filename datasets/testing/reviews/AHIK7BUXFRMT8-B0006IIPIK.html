<meta name="summary" content="A Delightful Trip Down Memory Lane"></head><body><p>As a boy growing up in the 1930's I can still vividly remember my excitement on Saturday mornings as my dad would take me to our local theater for the Saturday morning fun club. There would be a feature film plus a shorter cliff-hanger serial that would leave the hero in a life threatening situation which was not resolved until the next installment the following Saturday morning.<br /><br />It was there I saw my first Buck Rogers serial and I was hooked for life on science fiction. It was not until the Second World War that I would discover sci-fi pulp magazines. The Boy Scouts would collect waste paper for the war effort and I discovered science fiction pulp magazines; I was so excited by that discovery that I would keep every copy that came my way and read and re-read them.<br /><br />My wife tells me that when we married one of the few things I owned was my treasured collection of sci-fi pulp magazines; sadly they somehow disappeared as some of those are now worth a lot of money.<br /><br />I mention that because this movie reminded me of that era and those serials and those pulp magazines. The magazines always had lurid covers of space ships, heroes, villains, and space monsters enough to satisfy the imagination of almost any young boy. This movie does a marvelous job of capturing the emotions generated by those magazines and movies.<br /><br />It communicated powerfully with my memories of those times and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Although there are fewer of us now, if you are one who can share my memories of that bygone era, I encourage you to get this movie. If you're of a younger generation and can free your imagination I suspect you'll be able to enjoy it too.<br /><br />For the record I'm still a dedicated sci-fi fan and enjoy an extensive collection of books and movies.</p></body></html>

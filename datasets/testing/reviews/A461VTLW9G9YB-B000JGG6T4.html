And little Dakota aww how cute is she. She also did a good job, when the movie was done I wanted to watch it all over again. Yes it has a lot of violence and explosions but it was needed for the movie. I loved the song Blues Bayou. Wonderful movie. Can't wait until the DVD comes out!</p></body></html>

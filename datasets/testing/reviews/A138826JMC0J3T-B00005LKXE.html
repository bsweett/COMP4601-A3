<meta name="summary" content="Hannibal"></head><body><p>Hannibal was great!  It's a great psychological, suspense thriller that just chilling and all out, a great movie.  Anthony Hopkins returns as Dr. Hannibal Lechter, 10 years after SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Also starring in this is Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling and Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman.<p>It's been 10 years since Dr Lechter escaped from custody and his case has been all but forgotten except by 2 people, Clarice Starling and Mason Verger (Oldman), the only survivor of Hannibal Lechter.  Horribly disfigured and scarred thanks to Lechter, Verger has been waiting 10 years to exact revenge on Dr Lechter and now the time is finally right because Verger finds him.  Agent Starling then reopens the case in hope that she'll find him first and be abto find him in time before Verger gets a hold of him.<p>Hannibal isn't nearly as psychologically scary as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was but I will say that it has a lot more gore in it.  Here's 2 perfect examples, the end scenes and the library.  Hopkins really puts up another quality performance as Dr Lechter.  There are 2 down sides to this movie.  Julianne Moore replaces Jody Foster as Clarice Starling.  It would have been nice to have the original, but Moore does a very good job.  The other thing is that the ending might disappoint a few people.  Personally, I thought it was a good ending and it added a bit a fear to it.  <p>Either way it goes, make sure you watch SILENCE OF THE LAMBS first because there are so many references to it that if you don't see it, than HANNIBAL won't seem as good to you.  I recommend this one to anyone who's into the series and to anyone who likes suspense thrillers because this one will do that for you.  Plus, Hopkins says the classic line "Hello Clarice".  Check out HANNIBAL!</p></body></html>

While Halle Berry seems to have worked hard enough to make a name for herself, this movie set her back past Square One.  She has to reestablish herself all over again thanks to this tripe.<br /><br />Halle Berry plays a churchmouse clerk named Patience at a cosmetics company that is about to introduce a new beauty cream.  When she discovers that this new miracle product has tragic side effects, she is done away with by the top executives of the company.  She survives the attack and becomes the inner vamp, Catwoman.<br /><br />While this is certainly true to the roots of Catwoman in the comics, this movie is so terrible it's almost painful.  Halle Berry is acting like a cat (the jerky movements watching fish in an aquarium, liking sushi, etc.) and it looks ridiculous rather than insightful method acting.  The plot descintegrates as she is attempting to battle the evil corporation from releasing this product, her relationship with Bejamin Bratt goes to weirdness, and we are treated to little if anything than looking at her perfectly fit, cut body in those skin tight leathers with a whip.<br /><br />Why 2 stars rather than 1?  Sharon Stone was pretty good in this movie, despite what she had to work with she is a great actress.  Plus on the special features section, we see a history of Catwoman hosted by Eartha Kitt which is very good.  Catwoman is a great character, the inner vamp that no one, not even Batman himself can catch, but this movie was weak, campy and just plain bad.</p></body></html>

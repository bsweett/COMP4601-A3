<meta name="summary" content="Classic and Classy Thriller"></head><body><p>Both this movie and Flight Plan came out at roughly the same time, and they both have that main ingredient necessary to make a classic mystery thriller. They both take place in enclosed spaces. With Agatha Christie, it always used to be the old manor house, specifically the library (where the body would be found). Now with movies like Red Eye, we have that ideal claustrophobic setting provided by an airplane. There's no escape. You're locked in there with the villain.<br /><br />In this case, the villain is truly scary. The individual playing that part almost changes facial contours - from initial affability, with just a hint of the sinister - to a physiognamy of outright Hyde-like evil.<br /><br />All the other actors do similarly admirable jobs with their roles.<br /><br />The movie has a rather lame ending - with the usual bloody confrontation between good and evil. But the ride itself is well worth the fare.</p></body></html>

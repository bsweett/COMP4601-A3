I give it an &quot;almost 5,&quot; only because I can't help but compare it to &quot;Immortal Beloved,&quot; a film that struck me as superior both in tone and subject matter.  (I prefer Beethoven to Mozart, and also tend to favor Beethoven's brooding presence and inner demons.  I also like Gary Oldman a great deal more than either F. Murray Abraham or Tom Hulce.)<p>But make no mistake.  This is a beautiful, rich film that centers on a personal conflict that ought to resonate in most of us--the conflicting admiration and jealously we often feel for those who are both better than us and so naturally gifted that excellence seems effortless to them.  Salieri shows the worst of human nature in a perform that is both true and revealing.  Hulce's Mozart is an audacious character, and whether it is true to Mozart's persona (a frightening thought, suggesting that silliness, arrogance, and genius go hand in hand) or not, is interesting and engaging.  But Abraham is the star here.  He is the heart of the movie.  And if I had to point out one flaw, it is that the character of Mozart simply isn't sufficiently fleshed out.  He ends up being a caricature in many respects, which is disappointing.</p></body></html>

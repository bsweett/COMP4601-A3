<meta name="summary" content="quirky but uneven"></head><body><p>Just for those thinking it's sacrilegious for Mr. Tarantino to have invented a alternative, B-movie version of WWII history, I say go fly a kite.<br /><br />In fact, I wish Mr. Tarantino would make several more such movies, playing fast and loose with various periods of history until we get it through our heads that doing this opens up creative avenues of insight and adventures that we currently deny ourselves.  Authors in previous ages certainly wouldn't have scrupled.<br /><br />But the thing seems thematically uneven to be considered great.  From what I read, Tarantino took 10 years to write this, and it shows.  They say you shouldn't take that long to write something, because there are too many changes in the author himself during such a time.  Thus what you finally come up with is likely to be stylistically and thematically clunky.  (Think of Moby-Dick:  unfortunate that the author went through so many changes while writing that.)<br /><br />It's like Tarantino was at times trying to do this, at other times trying to do that.  In the end we get something that doesn't cohere stylistically and is only intermittently entertaining.</p></body></html>

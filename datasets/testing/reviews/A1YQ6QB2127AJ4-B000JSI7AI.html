<meta name="summary" content="The True Best Picture of 2005"></head><body><p>In 1963, two young men Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are searching for summer work.  They find this in Brokeback Mountain in a small Wyoming city.  What they find is much more than just summer work; rather, much more than what they expected.  After months of staying in the camp site hurdling sheep and other duties, they find love within one another.  Neither had examined their sexualities before arriving at Brokeback Mountain.  The end of the summer leaves them heartbroken due to the separation.  Ennis stays in Wyoming, marries a woman named Alma, and has two girls.  Jack moves to Texas, intenses his career as a cowboy, marries a woman named Lureen, and has a boy.  Five years later, Ennis and Jack reunite and discover that their love they shared remains.  However, society and the times prevent them from sharing the love as deep as their desires.  This relationship leads to romance and heartbreak.<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain", adapted from the short story of the same name by Annie Proulx, was beautifully crafted by its cast and crew.  It proceeded to receive nominations and win several major awards, including eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) leading to three wins (Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score).  Its emotional impact remains alive throughout the film.  They beautifully express the characters' pain and turmoil caused by a homophobic society.  This adaptation is one of the best screenplays written in many years.  Few other filmmakers have crafted a storyline that compiles twenty-five years of events within only two hours while sharing its story so deeply.  Its storyline placement and series of events proved highly difficult, yet succeeded in many ways.<br /><br />Many are quick to label "Brokeback Mountain" a gay film.  However, it is much more than that.  It is a story of love, secrets, loneliness, and struggle to express their true selves.  This is one of many qualities that make this film so groundbreaking.  Therefore, its viewers will quickly recall the characters Ennis and Jack and how much of an impact they made.  This is the first film with a romance of two people of the same sex as its primary subject line to receive such critical success.  Therefore, this will surely open doors for other filmmakers to continue pushing the envelope.<br /><br />This film could not have been so monumental through its emotional stance if it wasn't for the actors' hard work.  Three of its eight Oscar nominations were for acting: Best Actor (Heath Ledger), Best Supporting Actor (Jake Gyllenhaal), and Best Supporting Actress (Michelle Williams).  For years, Ledger and Gyllenhaal have been underrated talent-wise, despite several wonderful performances (Ledger's "The Patriot", "Monster's Ball"; Gyllenhaal's "The Good Girl", "Donnie Darko").  Ledger's performance as Ennis, a quiet and lonely man, showcases his talents further than in the past.  Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack, an eccentric and and outgoing man, fits well with Ennis and the overall film.  Williams and Anne Hathaway successfully placed their teenage image aside for the film.  Williams proves that she is much more than just "Dawson's Creek" as the lonely and gentle Alma.  Hathaway proves that she is much more than just "The Princess Diaries" as the sassy and feisty Lureen.<br /><br />Such film quality proves that "Brokeback Mountain" will stand beyond the test of time.  Therefore, this is destined to become a classic.  Hopefully by that time, the government will have legalized same-sex marriage.</p></body></html>

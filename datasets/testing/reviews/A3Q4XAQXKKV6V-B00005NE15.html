<meta name="summary" content="Halloween seems to be a fluke"></head><body><p>...the Thing (***), the Fog (**), Ghosts on Mars (-*)Vampires (-**) seem to try and recapture the magic of Halloween, like the score in the Fog really tries to be Halloween but falls apart from its unoriginality. ... The mood and sets of this movie are actually really pretty good. The set-up is great, the first hour is very nice, but the movie quickly devolves into a real witless piece of revenge. (Um, why do the zombies come back 100 years later? How do they know it's 100 years later? Do they have calanders? Why even take revenge on the town NOW? They didn't do anything to you zombie folk.)<p>I just have to ask, why do drowned zombies KNOCK on the door trying to get in? The first time I saw this, I was like, OK, that has to be someone else leading us to believe it is one of the villians... but sure enough, the zombies knock on the door trying to get in! How polite!<p>The transfer, sound and extras on this are really great and add quite a bit of value to this movie... however you must like the movie first for it to matter... John Carpenter says during the commentary that Hal Holbrook didn't like the movie when it was finished. I have to second that. I like elements of it, but the movie as a whole doesn't measure up to his previous works, I mean work, Halloween.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Are you going to watch yourself die tonight?""></head><body><p>A decade ago I used to watch my fair share of horror movies, but at some point I started to have trouble finding good films in this genre. This resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of horror productions I watched each year. I am happy to say that "Saw" was reminiscent of the good old times. This is a movie that has an electrifying pace, plenty of gore, thrills galore and a clever plot.<br /><br />It all starts with two men chained on opposite ends of a filthy, rusty and generally disgusting bathroom. Between the two, there is a dead man with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. The two prisoners are clueless as to what is going on, with Dr. Lawrence Gordon being by far the calmer of the two, and Adam freaking out. Of course, at this point we are asking ourselves, what does the kidnapper want? But we do not have to wait long, and soon enough, the games begin. Adam finds a tape in his pocket, and Lawrence finds not only a tape, but also a key and a bullet. You can probably guess, but just in case, let me tell you that the key does not work on the locks that are keeping them chained.<br /><br />The point of the game is that Lawrence has to manage to kill Adam by 6 pm, or the psycho will kill his wife and daughter. At that time, we also find out that Lawrence has been a suspect in previous murders by this killer. We then get a combination of flashbacks to previous events related to this case, and the ordeal the two men are going through.<br /><br />The previous cases show us a very creative and twisted individual, who does not really kill his victims, but makes them kill themselves. In these scenes you will get a high dose of gore, so this movie is not for people that are even a little bit squeamish. If you like horror films though, I guarantee that you will be entertained through the duration of this movie and that your nerves are going to be seriously tested. There is only one reason I did not give this movie five stars; the acting. Both, Whannell and Elwes, deliver sub par performances, with exaggerated facial expressions that do not fit the mood of the film. Everything else on this movie is right on target.</p></body></html>

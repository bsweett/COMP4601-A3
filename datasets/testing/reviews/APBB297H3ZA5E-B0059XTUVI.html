<meta name="summary" content="Forget the politics and accuracy; it's just boring"></head><body><p>1.  I'll make this review short and sweet:  forget the politics and forget the pro / con arguments regarding the "accuracy" of this movie.  Yes, those are important things for a movie that deals with someone's life.  But the overwhelming issue with this movie is even more basic;  it's just a dreadfully boring movie.  Furthermore, this lamest of movies is exacerbated by the terrible method of film making (at least in this case) where the scenes go from the present (ie demented state) to the past.<br />2.  Bottomline:  to all potential folks interested in watching this movie (and it doesn't matter if your liberal, conservative or unclear), just do yourself a huge favor and bypass this movie because it's just simply boring and semi-confused.</p></body></html>

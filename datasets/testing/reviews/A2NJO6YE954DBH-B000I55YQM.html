<meta name="summary" content="An above average remake of the original classic film"></head><body><p>I have to give credit to screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris for the way they played with the original 1962 screenplay by George Axelrod based on Richard Condon's novel "The Manchurian Candidate."  The original film is a classic and for all those who have seen it this 2004 version provides minor twists and turns for all of the major characters and plot points.  You know what is going to happen, but not exactly, so that Jonathan Demme's film works pretty much equally well for those who have seen the original and those who have not.<br /><br />Of course, for those who have seen the original Denzel Washington plays the Frank Sinatra character (Captain Marco), Liev Schreiber the Laurence Harvey character (Raymond Shaw), Meryl Streep the Angela Landsbury character (Raymond's mother), and Kimberly Elise the character played by Janet Leigh.  Forty years down the road politics has changed enough that now Raymond's mom is not married to a U.S. Senator but one herself and Raymond is now the title character.  The "Manchurians" this time around are not Chinese Communists but a multi-national corporation, which actually makes the situation more realistic than the original (at least in terms of the villains).  Despite the appearance of liberal gadfly Al Franken as a television commentator, there really is nothing to really pin down which political party we are talking about here, which is fine, because it works either way.<br /><br />On the eve of Desert Storm a reconnaissance mission is ambushed.  Most of the unit survives and Sergeant Raymond Shaw is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions.  When he returns to the United States he is elected a Congressman from New York and is pushed for the vice president spot on the party's ticket by his Senator mother.  But Marco and the other members of the unit have been having the strange dream and are becoming convinced that the story they have been repeating is not what really happened.  By the time Marco finds something under the skin on his back, it seems there is something at work here that is more serious than depression or Gulf War syndrome.  Could it all be some giant conspiracy?  Oh, you had better believe it.<br /><br />One of the ironies of watching this version of "The Manchurian Candidate" this particular week is that as Raymond Shaw is suddenly put on the presidential ticket while there are media references to "the Lost Patrol" that he saved, there is no effort by the media to contact Marco or any of the other members of the unit.  This week everybody who ever stepped foot on a Swift Boat during the Vietnam War, whether they knew John Kerry or not, gets to be on television.  But Shaw the war hero has no contact with the men he supposedly saved and nobody in the media seems to notice because that would make playing out the game here a lot more difficult.  So we make allowances.<br /><br />Washington's Marco does not get to be as heroic as Sinatra was in the original, not only because the script takes a slightly different tack but also because we have a different expectation today of what happens to people when their brains get messed with my mad scientists.  Schreiber does a nice job as the man who is caught in between who he is, who he wants to be, and who he remembers he was once upon a time.  I think that those who insist on seeing Hilary Clinton in Streep's performance are missing the point, because I see sure signs of the hyperbolic female talking heads on television news programs.  Pyne and Georgaris get special credit for fixing the major hole in the original film, which was why Janet Leigh takes up with Frank Sinatra (it always bugged me since it suggested it was setting up something but was not).<br /><br />In case it is not clear, if you have not seen the original version of "The Manchurian Candidate," then you should do so.  At this point you should probably wait until after you have seen this one and if for some reason you feel you should only see one version then it should definitely be the original, but it does belong on your must see list, even if it is in black & white and the Cold War means nothing to you.  For everyone who has seen both films, I definitely doubt that anyone will prefer the new to the old, but I also think that few viewers will consider this remake (or updated version) to be an insult to John Frankenheimer's original.</p></body></html>

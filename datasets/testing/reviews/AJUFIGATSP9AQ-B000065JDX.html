<meta name="summary" content="Crime/Horror great BD Best & Must, A/V Tops"></head><body><p>The disc is great. (My first Canadian import, more on the way) Allience's BD is astonishing in picture and sound quality, compared to the Dimension DVD; the sound is tops, very balanced with strong bass (&LFE). The voices were clear. I say so, have good gear and the disc is very good. ( I thought I should give it a close eye&ear and I say it's A-OK) These HD days, you have to adjust the sound, when it's powerful and that's good,right?<br />I saw this film at an opening week at the CINERAMA Dome in L.A. and half way through the movie, half the audience walked out. Are you man or woman enough for FROM DUSK TILL DAWN in 1080p?</p></body></html>

How they made the lovely Charlize Theron look so unbecoming is remarkable and she completely nailed the part of Aileen.  Ricci was just as good an actress and deserved some recognition.<br /><br />There was nothing fancy or beautified about this movie at all. It was edgy, a bit raw and very straight forward.  All the more convincing and a highly recommended watch.  No sympathizing here with Aileen, just the straight story telling of her life and her tragic end.</p></body></html>

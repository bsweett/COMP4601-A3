<meta name="summary" content="another wanna be horror fan"></head><body><p>I go to many horror film websites and mesage boards, and I am always assaulted with reviews about this film. It seems even a new generation of horror fans seem to think they aren't a real genre pro if they don't like this film. So, it is about a ballet school run by Beulah Ballbreaker. Tacky late 70's overkill on the colors, looks like Willy Wonka meets Liquid Sky. Take away the colors and sets, and what do you have? A long, boring film. I am afraid I will have to discredit any reviewer who includes this as the greatest film ever made. This film is to horror movies, what American Idol  is to the indie music scene, a total annoyance. Run for your life if you come across a person who says this the greatest film, they haven't a clue what they are talking about...if you come across a website citing this as the best horror film, click exit and keep searching for new sites. I know a lot about Italian cinema, yes I am a Lucio Fulci fan. So I know this just doesn't stand up to all the praise. Granted it is good and probably better than Hollywood films on many levels, but what the hype is all about I do not know..</p></body></html>

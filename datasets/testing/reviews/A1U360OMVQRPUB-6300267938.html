<meta name="summary" content="HD DVD Tech Just Keeps Getting Better"></head><body><p>I just watched THE SEARCHERS on HD DVD and was extremely impressed.  The color transfer is absolutely brilliant.  The colors are vibrant and alive, and the Utah badlands where the film was shot is gloriously represented in shape, shadow, and shade.  The film was originally shot in Technicolor in 1956, but I had no idea what the quality would be like until I popped the disc in and the first few frames started playing.  The wide, sweeping shots through the camera lens are breath-taking, but the filtered effects to do the "night" shots hold a glow to them and sharpness of the actors' shadows that just isn't possible in true dark.  Still, rather than being distracting, it's more indicative of the process that was used.<br /><br />John Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, a Confederate cavalry man returning to his brother's farm after three years of wandering.  No soon is the family introduced than Ethan is called away to help track a band of Indian horse thieves.  But the trail is just a ruse and the Texas Rangers end up getting back too late to save their loved ones.  This starts up a manhunt for the last little girl from the family.  The trail crosses thousands of miles and five years, and involves changes within the characters.<br /><br />THE SEARCHERS was the 12th film John Wayne worked on with John Ford, and it stands the test of time as one of their greatest achievements.<br /><br />Although the story is a slower-paced than present-day tales would be, it encompasses a lot of territory and a lot of emotion.  Some of the accents(such as Ken Curtis's portrayal of Charlie McCory) were too pronounced and struck a false note.  And Jeffrey Hunter's emotional outlets were sometimes too forced.  The action sequences were given short shrift by today's standards as well, but on the plus side, a lot happens in the two hours of movie time.<br /><br />Western fans and John Wayne fans have probably already got this one.  If not, they should.  But the HD DVD version is definitely a reason to start thinking about plunking down hard-earned cash to upgrade the home entertainment system.</p></body></html>

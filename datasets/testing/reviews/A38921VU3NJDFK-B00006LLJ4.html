<meta name="summary" content="Minority Report (2002)"></head><body><p>Based on the short story by popular sci-fi novelist Philip K. Dick, this intelligent--and rather ominous--vision of the future is one of Steven Spielberg's finest works, and manages to captivate and stimulate viewers for nearly two-and-a-half hours. The story, too, presents a long-thought-over theoretical conundrum regarding individual independence and self-government vs. fortune that is predestined by a higher power--the eternal battle between religion and evolutionary humanism. More faintly, however, this film probes the mental and technical processes by which criminals plan their crimes and law enforcement pursues the criminals. Shot with an over-exposed lens and a desaturated color palette, Minority Report grows more beautiful with each successive scene, and also entails magnificent special effects of various ultramodern technology and gadgetry (including the ingenious mechanical "spiders").</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MORE ROTTEN HORROR FARE! (Spoiler Below)"></head><body><p>"Final Destination 2," like it's predecessor, is a scary film: scarily bad. With the people knowing what signs to look for before a death occurs, there's no sense of terror: We pretty much KNOW how people are going to die. The few jump moments are put in as almost an afterthought. And the death scene at the end felt like a Monty Python gag than an actual horror film element. The cast does a descent job with what they got, but it's not enough to save this horrible horror film. For straight horror-film fans only; the rest can skip it.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: D</p></body></html>

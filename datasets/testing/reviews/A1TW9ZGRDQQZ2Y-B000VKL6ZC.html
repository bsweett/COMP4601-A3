<meta name="summary" content="A unique remake that lacks the horror"></head><body><p>I did like how Rob Zombie made this remake very different from the original 1978 masterpiece of horror. Most horror film remakes today are the exact same film with bigger production values and zero horror. At least Rob made something totally fresh, though it has many flaws. I liked Michael Myers much better when I knew nothing about him. Now he is given a more realistic abused past and thus makes him human. Big mistake. The acting is decent enough for a horror film, but even the original wasn't the best acted film, so I can't really knock this one too much in that department. I think this is the third best film in the Halloween series after Halloween and Halloween II. Hallween 4 was okay, but all the rest aren't worth watching.</p></body></html>

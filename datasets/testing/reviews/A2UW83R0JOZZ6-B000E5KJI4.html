The time period that both take place in is similar and both have their roots in Greek/Roman history.  The films have their obvious heroes and protagonists and one veteran actor from the golden age of Hollywood (Peter O'Toole, Richard Harris).  Even the score by Howard Shore (A Beautiful Mind, Titanic) seeks to imitate the haunting eastern chants created by composer Lisa Gerrard (Whale Rider, The Insider).  Despite its best efforts to measure up, "Gladiator" is both technically and artistically a better film than "Troy" and the rest of this review will more than explain why.<br /><br />For this story, the clock rewinds 3200 years, the opening scene a blown-up map of the Greek empire during 1100 BC.  Many of Greece's cities are now under the rule of the militaristic autocrat Agamemnon (Cox), save one - Thessaly, a coastal region that resides westward of King Priam's (O'Toole) proud municipality of Troy.  Agamemnon's brother and fellow sovereign Menelaus (Gleeson) is amicable to the Trojans, inviting them to a sumptuous repast in his homeland of Sparta.  Rather than feasting his eyes on the myriad of dancing ladies that frolic about the banquet table, Prince Paris (Bloom) instead gazes longingly at Menelaus's young and resplendent wife Helen (Kruger).  Little does Menelaus know, Helen has been cavorting with Paris for quite some time and after another passionate embrace that evening, the prince beseeches her to steal away with him back to Troy.  Knowing the dissension her departure from Sparta will cause, Helen nonetheless lets her heart rule her head and boards a Trojan ship, instigating a war that will last for nearly fourteen years.<br /><br />The movie's greatest assets lie with the aforementioned O'Toole (Lawrence of Arabia, My Favorite Year) and Eric Bana (The Hulk).  Bana maintains a strong sense of integrity as Hector, heir to the throne of Troy and a great warrior in his own right.  O'Toole is mesmerizing in his every scene, such a commanding presence that the role of Priam is almost beneath him.  He even commented that in his heyday, he would've "murdered to play Achilles or Hector".  What a killer performance he would've given.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) coasts along, letting his looks do most of the work and later on takes to a bow like a master (visions of Legolas are hard to avoid when he swiftly and accurately deposits arrows into his enemies).  Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson look more like Vikings than Greeks, Cox devouring the role of Agamemnon with zeal - a little too much for his own good.  Sean Bean makes a respectable walk-on as does Julie Christie and Rose Byrne is passable as the vestal virgin Briseis.<br /><br />According to legend, Helen of Sparta was a REAL looker.  The "face that launched 1,000 ships" beheld a magic spell - one look at her ravishing physiognomy and a man was completely at her mercy.  German model Diane Kruger is no ugly duckling but she is also not phenomenal, either.  You would think a make-up artist would do their best to show off a woman's NATURAL beauty at a time when eyeshadow and mascara weren't available but Kruger's pleasant visage is loaded with cosmetics (Rose Byrne's mascara ran in every weepy scene).  It may as well be a Maybelline ad, not a period piece.<br /><br />As far as aesthetics, Brad Pitt is perfect as the unyielding Achilles.  With a 6-month training period before shooting in Malta even began, Pitt defined every major muscle group with the help of personal trainer Gregory Joujon-Roche.  The result is sizable biceps, thick and defined hamstrings and calves and perfect pectorals offset by a rippling six-pack.  His body alone is a wonder of the world.<br /><br />His acting, however, is less than legendary.<br /><br />Try as he might, Pitt is not made for a purely dramatic role and the portrayal of the stalwart Achilles suffers for it.  The dialogue loses some of its integrity for three reasons: Pitt rushes it, misinterprets it and tries ever so delicately to imply a British accent, no doubt to feel up to his British peers (Bloom, Bana, O'Toole, etc.).  "Devil's Own" was proof enough that Pitt is not adept at faking it, but thankfully he doesn't embarrass himself to that level here.  All the same, his awkwardness in Achilles's shoes is felt and don't let the rumors about his supposed "nude scene" fool you - not even a full shot of his tone, tanned glutes is available.  Of course, this rumor was designed to get the women flocking en masse to the cineplex, as was the casting of two other hard bodies with handsome mugs (Bana, Bloom).<br /><br />The script is highly lacking - there are shining moments, such as the meeting between Priam and Achilles after the poignant death of an integral character and Achilles's first encounter with Prince Hector while sacking a sacred temple.  The rest lies flat, particularly the dialogue between foes.  There is either too much talk or not enough of it and the exchange is spiritless and inconsequential.  The villains of the story are hard to appreciate for their duplicity nearly as much as the conniving Commodus of "Gladiator" (bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix) and the central female character of Helen is meek compared to the dignified and discerning Lucilla (Connie Nielsen).<br /><br />"Troy" also attempts to wow the pants off its audience with its myriad of CGI tricks, the movie's visual effects team creating tens upon thousands of digital soldiers for the storming of Troy's beaches and the sweeping vista of the 1,000 ships that sail across the Aegean on their way to war.  "Gladiator" had a much smaller digital stratagem, the most major being the coliseum that resided in the heart of Rome.  With half its images created by a series of complicated clicks on a mouse, "Troy" can't really be praised for exquisite cinematography - it's practically farmed in techno-land.<br /><br />So if you're headed to the video store this evening and can't decide between "Gladiator" or "Troy", this review should help you make a quick (and smart) decision.</p></body></html>

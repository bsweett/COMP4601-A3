<meta name="summary" content="Good Film But Not So Great DVD Version! Updated for Blu-Ray Release!"></head><body><p>This film is certainly one of Scorcese's best although to say it matches the calibre of Coppola's work on "The Godfather I &/or II" would be stretching it.  It's a good film though that's based on a true story and succeeds admirably in portraying a no-holds-barred story of what life in the mafia is like and is like a good adjunct to the whole "Godfather" franchise.<br /><br />This dvd version though isn't perfect as although the sound quality is good and sounded like it was a Dolby 5.1 Surround setup on my system but the picture quality hasn't been restored leaving a lot of frames with those irritating white spots.  I note that a Blu-ray version has been released and so here's hoping they took the opportunity to clean up the picture quality a little bit more.  No special features of note here as well but overall, if you don't mind the few picture imperfections and if you are not into the making-of documentaries or cast interviews then this dvd version should suffice.<br /><br />My recommendation though is to get the Blu-ray version but if you need to get the standard version, this dvd will do if you can do without the extras.<br /><br />Updated 17 July 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately I'll have to do this here: the blu-ray release is definitely an improvement over the dvd release I reviewed above but as far as comparison with other blu-ray releases that are out there this ranks as average.  The good thing is that they got rid of virtually all the white spots although the vertical scratch line on De Niro's face is still there but overall at least picture quality-wise we get a vast improvement over the dvd.  Sound-wise the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround is still good but not a great deal better than the dvd release.  The Special Features section is vastly improved over the dvd with making-of documentaries and even a short interview with the real Henry Hill.  Overall this is much better than the dvd release but it is not perfect and hopefully they will release a future blu-ray version in a nifty digibook format and a more perfect picture quality soon.<br /><br />Verdict: mixed bag but definitely better than the standard dvd release.</p></body></html>

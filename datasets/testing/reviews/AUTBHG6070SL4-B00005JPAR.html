It's beautiful, even if it tends towards a gold-sepia monochrome and big-face closeups. It manipulates your emotions, but does it well. More important: once the movie grabs your attention, it gives something grand in return. Remember how many art spectacles don't, then understand why that matters to me. It's beautiful, and it inspires sentiment that's more than a paperback-cover deep.<br /><br />If you can't feel why Jackman's scientist mourns in the lab, then you've missed most of the movie. I've felt that, a little, so I've glimpsed the uniquely human emotion being portrayed: hard, shining intellect driven by white-hot emotion. That feeling takes both; if you feel the need to argue, then you've never been taken up by that frame of mind. I think I understand a little about the conquistador, too: dying-deep love of queen and country, and personal bravery in every moment. None of that precludes art, including the devotion to a work that has to go beyond death. The work has its own life, and the human workmen must sometimes pass the vision on.<br /><br />"The Fountain" is baffling and nonlinear. It cloys and it brutalizes. It's just beyond belief. It's probably the most involving and evocative movie I've seen in the last twenty years. It engages emotions that I have never been able to share with anyone, not in my whole life. Maybe, just maybe, you've spent a lot of your life all alone with feelings like mine. As of now, you're not alone any more.<br /><br />For all that, I'm still not sure whether it's a good movie. It's great, but I don't know whether it's good. Greatness is good enough for me.<br /><br />//wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release</p></body></html>

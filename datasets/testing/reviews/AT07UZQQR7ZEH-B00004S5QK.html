<meta name="summary" content="Maybe the best color musical ever made"></head><body><p>Often considered the greatest movie musical ever made, Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952, MGM) starts with a witty Betty Comden and Adolph Green script about the advent of sound.  How did it revolutionize the film industry in the late 1920's and for actors who could not talk?  The plight of the latter is immortalized by Jean Hagen, in the performance of a lifetime as Lina Lamont, an actress with a loud and squeaky voice.  As someone says, "Lina's a triple threat-she can't sing, she can't dance, and she can't talk."<br /><br />The movie's three main stars are Gene Kelly as matinee actor Don Lockwood (and the movie's co-choreographer); Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Seldon, the pretty actress Don loves; and Donald O'Connor as best friend Cosmo Brown.  All three are wonderful, and Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown give them fabulous songs to sing:  "You Were Meant For Me," "All I Do is Dream of You," O'Connor's show-stopping "Make `Em Laugh," the title song, "You Are My Lucky Star", and the overwhelmingly colorful "Broadway Melody" climax.<br /><br />The production values here are so colorful and irresistible-cinematography, production design, and costumes just don't get any more beautiful.  The movie is drenched in gorgeous color in every scene.  One could get drunk on this movie's visuals!  How, pray tell, they all three areas lose out on Oscar nomiations the year after AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (1951) swept the awards?  What was the Academy thinking?  Maybe one or two of them won for PARIS.  At least Adrienne Fazan DID get nominated for editing on SINGIN'.  Among the actors, only Hagen got nominated--and should have won the Oscar.<br /><br />The version of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN that I am reviewing and that you should buy is the 50th anniverary double disk DVD from Warner Home Video.  Disk one has the movie shimmeringly remastered and with a lavish audio commentary by just about everyone still alive in 2002.  Disk two has two magnificent and informative documentaries, one on the Arthur Freed Unit at MGM and one hosted by Reynolds on the making of SINGIN'. Also on disk two are generous original movie excerpts from more than a dozen other MGM musicals that first used SINGIN' songs, and a deleted Debbie Reynolds song that someone had the brains to save in the vaults.  It is a glorious total set--under $25-- and worthy of this greatest of color musicals.</p></body></html>

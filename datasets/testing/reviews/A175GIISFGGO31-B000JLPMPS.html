The story develops slowly,  the viewer learning in small bits about the main character William Munny.  The subtlety of the movie is its greatest strength.  Gene Hackman is incredible as the town Sheriff and won a well deserved Academy Award.  Eastwood also won a much deserved Academy Award for best director. <p>  If you like westerns this one is for you.  Its a classic.</p></body></html>

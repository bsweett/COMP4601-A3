<meta name="summary" content="INCREDIBLE MOVIE"></head><body><p>I must confess i loved this movie, it is very well conceived.  The computer animation is amazing and the dialogue is very funny.  I laughed my a** off at the Edith Head character, it was genius to channel her for this movie, she was the beginning and the end for movie fashion in her time.  This movie represents one of the rare instances when adults will enjoy a kids movie at least as much if not more than the children it is intended for.  Highly recommended on so many levels.</p></body></html>

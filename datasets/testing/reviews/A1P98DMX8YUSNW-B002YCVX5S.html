<meta name="summary" content="Re-imagining WW2 history"></head><body><p>This is a great Tarantino film, but kids, don't watch this for the history. It's no history flick, but an entirely re-imagined take on WW2, with a completely different ending. Divided into five chapters, each one is filled with tension that finally explodes so fast you barely have time to decipher it. This, of course, will remind people of the "Kill Bill" films. So be it. There 's a lot of unsavory violence as we watch Nazis being pulped with a baseball bat, and bodies being riddled with bullets. Brad Pitt is far from the lone star here, though his role is less central than credits make it appear. A fantasy movie. Great watch.</p></body></html>

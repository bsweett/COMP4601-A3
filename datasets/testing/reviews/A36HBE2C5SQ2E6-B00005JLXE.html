<meta name="summary" content="A decent comic book adaption ruined by its flaws."></head><body><p>After losing his eyes to a tragic nuclear<br /><br />waste accident, Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) starts<br /><br />developing superhuman powers and all of his other 4 senses are<br /><br />more keen then they previously were. He lives in<br /><br />external darkness, but yet he sees the light in<br /><br />innocent people who he defends by day, and harms their<br /><br />perps that have been discarded by the justice system<br /><br />and thrown into his own brand of justice. He plots<br /><br />revenge on anybody that harms the innocent. He then<br /><br />takes on the man that is making him do his job.<br /><br />The Kingpin is his main enemy and he must bring him to<br /><br />justice before anymore perps get back on the street<br /><br />Well, I have seen some comic book movies bomb and fail<br /><br />to grasp what the comics are about.<br /><br />I also have seen some filmmakers tarnish what is held<br /><br />dear to some people. I have to say, This is how a<br /><br />comic book movie should be done. Everything is not<br /><br />perfect, but it gets its point across and makes sense<br /><br />and makes the film enjoyable to watch. Also, even<br /><br />though there were some horrendus actors, I have to<br /><br />say, that Ben Affleck pulled off the performance of<br /><br />Matt Murdock decent enough. I also thought that<br /><br />Jennifer Garner was just eye candy and Colin Farrell<br /><br />was wasted as Bullseye.<br /><br />There were humongous plot holes in this. I<br /><br />was absolutely questioning how some of the things were<br /><br />being done and why. Some stuff felt out of place and<br /><br />and didn't really gel with what was going on in the<br /><br />film. It really made the experience of watching the<br /><br />film less enjoyable. I do not like point out plot<br /><br />holes to myself when I am watching a movie. I want the<br /><br />director to make sure the film has no plot holes. When<br /><br />a film has plot holes like Daredevil had, it makes you<br /><br />question the writing of the script and the screenplay<br /><br />by whomever wrote it. It really ticks me off when a<br /><br />writer makes such mistakes when he is writing a movie<br /><br />and trying to insert plots. What the writer did here<br /><br />was a failure to express what was going on. The only<br /><br />thing that I liked about the writing/screenplay was<br /><br />that he kept it dark and grimy and evil and good.<br /><br />The acting by Ben Affleck barely impressed me because<br /><br />Ben Affleck isn't that great of a actor and in his<br /><br />other roles, he has failed to impress me with his<br /><br />chops. The only movie that I actually liked him alot<br /><br />in was Good Will Hunting and he was very impressive in<br /><br />that. Mainly, I prefer his counterpart, Matt Damon,<br /><br />who by far is a more accomplished actor than he is. I<br /><br />hate to say it here, but Colin Farrell was wasted<br /><br />here. He was basically the best performance out of the<br /><br />bunch and I was satisfied with his performance as<br /><br />Bullseye. Jennifer Garner is just eye candy, plain and<br /><br />simple. She was there to provide the steamy part of<br /><br />the movie when she has the part of Matt's crush,<br /><br />Elecktra. I cannot believe they decided to make a<br /><br />spin-off of a eye candy character. Micheal Clarke<br /><br />Duncan is, in my opinion, a decent actor at best. I<br /><br />feel that he has had one great performance in his<br /><br />career and that was in The Green Mile. Again, he<br /><br />failed to impress me as the Kingpin and I was left<br /><br />unsatisfied after the movie ended.<br /><br />The movie has its flaws, its sometimes<br /><br />good performances  and sometimes not so good<br /><br />performances . But it was still a entertaining movie<br /><br />that I enjoyed watching but had the experience ruined<br /><br />by the gaping plot holes, the sometimes cringe worthy<br /><br />acting, and the lack of where the film was going. I<br /><br />was enjoying the experience of a comic book on the<br /><br />screen but the flaws absolutely ruined it for me.</p></body></html>

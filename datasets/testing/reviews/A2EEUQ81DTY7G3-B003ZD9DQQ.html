<meta name="summary" content="A portrait of a madman"></head><body><p>There's a lot going on in this incredibly powerful German film about the last days of Hitler. Primarily told from the perspective of Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), Hitler's infamous personal secretary, Downfall is all about the fall of Berlin as Hitler (Bruno Ganz) goes through the motions of masterminding fantasy counterattacks and disintegrating mentally.<br /><br />When his inner circle of generals and confidants begin to realize that they're losing the war, their allegiances to The Fuehrer begin to fracture and disintegrate, while the average German citizenry is left to cope with the out and out horror of a full scale Russian attack. As the Allies get close to Berlin, the story shows what it must have been like to be trapped in Hitler's bunker, to be caught up in wave after wave of shelling, and to realize, that if it is a choice of getting caught or suicide, taking one's life is the only option.<br /><br />Outside the bunker, we follow a variety of subplots involving a 13-year-old Hitler Youth named Peter who receives a medal from Hitler shortly before all hell breaks loose, and an impossibly noble army medic Dr. Schenk (Chrstian Berkel), who disobeys his orders and stays in Berlin to provide treatment to the locals. But the main dramatic impetus takes place inside Hitler's palatial fortress where he rants and raves at his most powerful leaders as he stands over maps, manipulating nonexistent divisions, desperately trying to turn his forces around to protect Berlin from the barrage of enemy attack.<br /><br />The high-ranking Nazi's are portrayed as a nervous, sweaty lot who are either ready to cut their losses and betray their leader or are just fed up and disillusioned with the whole process. Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) and Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) both beg Hitler to leave Berlin for the safety of German civilians, while Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) - a square-jawed conflicted wimp whose wife constantly prods him to do the Reich thing - tries in vain to stand up for the "noble" ideals of National Socialism in the face of crippling defeat.<br /><br />But it is the portrayal of the women that is the most affecting and perhaps the most firmly drawn: The fresh faced and beautiful Lara as Traudl Junge is so devoted to Hitler that she treats him like a father, and in the face crippling sense of disillusionment, becomes the singular reminder of how anyone could have fallen for Hitler's false promises in the first place. Juliane Kohler is superb as the ditzy and flighty Eva Braun, who is so obsessed with maintaining stoicism in every situation, that she even gets drunk and demands swing music and dancing as the shelling outside the bunker only increases.<br /><br />But the most powerfully sinister performance belongs to Corinna Harfouch as the benevolent purposeful Magda Goebbels. She's a one kind of political wife, who, while hysterically begging Hitler to leave Berlin, also possesses a steely and determined resolve to spare her six children from living "in a world without National Socialism." The most horrific scene in the film is when this calmly psychotic and resolute woman sedates her children with "special medicine."<br /><br />Much has been made of director, Oliver Hirschspiegel's efforts to portray Hitler as a somewhat sympathetic character. The film certainly shows him vacillating between moments of intense madness and tender kindness. Consideration is enthusiastically given to those people who believed whole-heartedly in the Nazi party and who have thoroughly devoted themselves to it. But as he blames the German people for failing him and blithely announces that they deserve death and congratulates himself for ridding the country of scourge of the Jewish, the film finally shows him up for what he really was.<br /><br />Ganz gives a brave performance in a showcase role imbuing Hitler with sure-handed mix of sadness, anger, craziness, and eventually false hope. Hitler is always recognizably human, if still disreputable, and Ganz never shies away from showing both facets of his complex personality. And as the movie steadily revolves around his moods, his final decent seems to bring Berlin itself to madness.<br /><br />It has never ceased to amaze me that for all the death, destruction and mayhem that was caused, not once did Hitler or any of his cohorts ever express regret or sorrow at the terrible results of their ghastly and appalling world-historical project.

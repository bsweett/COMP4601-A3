The movie has a religious message that will turn alot of nonbelievers off, if they cannot get past it. Being somewhat of a neutral person when it comes to religion, I enjoyed the movie as just what it was, a movie. And if it makes you feel any better, one of the Hughes Brothers is an atheist. So if an atheist can direct a film about the power of the Bible, everyone should be able to watch it. Sorry if anyone considers that a spoiler, but yeah. The Book of Eli is a Holy Bible. I was quite impressed to see old Denzel swinging his machete, dagger or whatever the blade was, like a trained assassin. No matter how good I expect him to perform, he always does better. It was also nice to see Gary Oldman return to his roots as the villain after nearly a decade of playing Sirius Black in Harry Potter and Gordan in Batman. Mila Kunis is okay, but I'm not sure if she was exactly right for her role. She looked and sounded so clean and neat, while everyone else around her looked like they were actually in a post-apocalytic world. She wasn't bad though. Overall, The Book of Eli is pretty good. It's definitely worth the price of admission.</p></body></html>

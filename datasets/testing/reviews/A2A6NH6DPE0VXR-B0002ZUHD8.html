<meta name="summary" content="Fun and exciting, I loved it!"></head><body><p>I walked into this film not knowing what to expect and I really was surprised how much I enjoyed it. I never  saw Clive Owen in anything before this and I must say he was great as Arthur. He has a strong screen presence that I was surprised by. Kiera Knightly is also really good as Guinevere. Kiera Knightly is gonna be a huge star. I think she was even better here than she was in Pirates of the Carribean. She's believable in tough women roles where she doesn't take crap from anyone. She's also very sensual and sexy, the camera loves her and she can act too. So yes she's going places. <p>  Sure there has been lots of King Arthur films but most of them focused on the same story. They all had Guinevere fall for Lancelot and vice versa with both of them betraying their loyalty to Arthur. Here you get a fresher Arthur story that was never told before. Lancelot obviously loves Guinevere but she loves Arthur and not him. He knows this and he never gets too close to her. He mostly just steals looks at her. In this film you know Lancelot is too loyal to Arthur to go with his feelings for Guinevere. <p>  The actors and characters are strong and they help the film be more engaging. The battles are fantastic too.  They're exiting and intense. The battle on ice is cool but in some ways the one in Merlin is better. The battle at the end is the most compelling and totally makes the movie though. The story itself could've used more work but still I admire the film-makers for trying to be original story wise. They could've just gave us the same story we've seen many times before  but they chose otherwise and it worked for me. It's not a fantasy and Merlin isn't this great magical wizard....he's this dirty wise warririor guy that lives in the forest lol. Plus Arthur never goes looking for the Holy Grail. The movie is about love, characters with real emotions, friendship and freedom. It's not a great movie but it's a really good movie and deserved a lot more of an audience than was there when I saw it.</p></body></html>

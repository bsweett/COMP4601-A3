<meta name="summary" content="Best Tarantino movie yet"></head><body><p>The Kill Bill series is a real masterpiece.  This review counts for both movies.  They are both very entertaining works of art.  The action is brutal and great, the story is excellent, the performances are total bad a$$, the drama is great, overall this is the greatest revenge movie ever, and is also Tarantino's best so far, i hope he continues making movies until his sad sad death. Quentin is the man.</p></body></html>

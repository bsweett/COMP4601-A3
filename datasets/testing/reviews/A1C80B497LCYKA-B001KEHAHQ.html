It can't be good, because this film is so bad. No one is doing good work, so they can't be happy. But who is causing the problems? Director Shawn Levy? Writer and star Steve Martin?<br /><br />Anyone who saw Kevin Kline in A FISH CALLED WANDA knows how funny he can be. But in THE PINK PANTHER, he seems almost bored. He is in and out of character - as well as accent - so often that it's difficult to determine just what Chief Inspector Dreyfus is supposed to be: surely not funny, and surely not French. In the original, he is definitely French, and Clouseau is definitely driving him crazy - but not in this version. Here he gets beat up a lot; but that's not what made the Dreyfus character funny in the original - it was his borderline insanity.<br /><br />While Steve Martin seems sincere in his efforts as Inspector Clouseau, they fall flat because the writing - which he shared in - isn't funny. He doesn't understand slapstick, which is the type of humor used in the original PINK PANTHERS - and with good reason, given Inspector Clouseau's proneness to accident. He doesn't even understand his own character. Clouseau is supposed to be a self-deluded dim wit: he believes he's a great detective, but he's anything but. He bungles everything, is oblivious to clues that are right under his nose, and when he does something right, it is purely by accident. Not in this film. In this version, Clouseau actually solves the murder mystery through his powers of observation and deductive reasoning, as well as his knowledge of Chinese. That totally destroys the entire premise upon which the Clouseau character is based!<br /><br />I have to scratch my head and wonder who didn't get it most: director Shawn Levy, writer-actor Steve Martin, the producers - who? I know that remakes are difficult, and especially the remake of two comic geniuses like Blake Edwards, who directed the originals, and Peter Sellers, the original Clouseau. But why didn't they take their cue from the originals and stick to what worked? Now there is an entire generation that will think the PINK PANTHER movies are dumb - as the reviews already indicate. But the originals weren't dumb: they were comic genius at it's best.<br /><br />Just about the only thing in this film that resembles the originals are the names of the two main characters and the fact that most of the story takes place in France. It does use the wonderful Henry Mancini theme music in the beginning. But the story opens with a soccer coach owning the world's largest diamond, the Pink Panther, and wearing it to a soccer game! That's not funny: it's ridiculous, as most everything else in this film is. I don't think Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers need worry about losing their rightful places in film history, or being forgotten. But this film will soon be forgotten, as it quickly finds its rightful place in the discount bin of your local DVD store.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

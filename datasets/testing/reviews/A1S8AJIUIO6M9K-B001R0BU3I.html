<meta name="summary" content="Jeffrey Nachmanoff Hits It Out of the Park"></head><body><p>As a former spy and leading critic of the $65 billion a year spent by the secret world, I normally limit my DVD intake to hotels and airplanes, but this one attracted my attention and deservedly so.<br /><br />This is one of a tiny handful of decent depictions of the spy world, and I want to note that Jeffrey Nachmanoff, a name most will not notice, was also the screen writer for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMXX">The Day After Tomorrow (Widescreen Edition)</a>.<br /><br />The over-all plot is credible, well-acted, well-filmed, and I was pulled in to give this my undivided attention.  The subtleties of inter-agency competition and non-sharing were well integrated.<br /><br />Bottom line: a top-notch offering all the way around, but I want to single out Nachmanoff for getting it right.  He's a talent to watch.<br /><br />See also:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUNYO">Taken [Blu-ray</a>]<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OYAT44">Breach (Full Screen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K0DR">The Falcon and the Snowman</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000228EK4">The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007LV9M">Smiley's People</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006A8T4">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XASZ8">American Drug War: The Last White Hope</a><br /><br />If you are interested in intelligence, I have written several books, all free online as well as for sale here at Amazon, and a great deal of information helpful to any citizen can be found at oss.net.</p></body></html>

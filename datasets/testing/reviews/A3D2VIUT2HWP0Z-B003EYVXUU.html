The screen-writers marry the alienation of being bullied with the variation of the vampire theme, and somehow try to make that alienation come out the same. The only way you can come to this conclusion is if you listen to the commentary and see the special features, and they are quite good.<br />  What is amazing is that the scarey scenes are almost totally digital, and the bully scenes are far too reminiscent of how I was treated myself by bullies. It really is a case of you have to see the film, AND hear the commentary to know what the movie covers and ALSO what the movie does not cover; and the film makers are very open about this aspect of the film. As some commentators  have indicated, the subtlties and nuancies of the original film and book are way out of the league of the english film, but it would seem that the author  of the original book is happy that his own story in fiction has made it out so far, so I suspect those that are motivated may go to read the original book in translation.<br />  The film is chilling and suspenseful in a broad sense, but not as scarey as I would have hoped for, especially given the scope of the subject matter. Its a bit odd that so many people who all agree that the exorcist is so scarey can't aspire to try and out scare people by out doing the exorcist in a "better" way.</p></body></html>

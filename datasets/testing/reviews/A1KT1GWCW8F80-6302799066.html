This one earns it."></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick's satire of the cold-war gone berserk was being made at about the same time (1964) as the &quot;serious&quot; treatment of the same theme by the movie &quot;Fail Safe&quot; starring Henry Fonda (also very good).<p>Shot in black-and-white, frequently in wide-angle for extended periods of time, there are many unforgettable images - probably the most-remembered of which is Major Kong (played by normally-a-cowboy actor Slim Pickens) riding the dropping bomb - &quot;Yee-haw...yee-hawwww!&quot;.<p>Although much has been made of Peter Sellers' 3 roles (which would have been four (as Major Kong) if not for breaking his ankle), I think Geroge C. Scott should have gotten an oscar for his performance. His &quot;itemization&quot; scene in the war-room was a thing of beauty - the single best part is when he gets to &quot;five...&quot;. Later, he also accidently (as rumor has it) falls down and somersaults to his feet, still delivering his line - and Kubrick decided to use it.<p>Sterling Hayden (normally a cowboy actor) also could have gotten an oscar for his performance as Jack D. Ripper, the Burpleson air force base commander who sends the planes against Russia. The scene when he tells Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers) about his plan is probably the best single scene overall in the movie, except for...<p>Peter Sellers as Dr. Strangelove at the end. He plays his German scientist role way way over the top. (&quot;Animals could be bred und slaughtered!&quot;). I won't spoil it further, however. Balances nicely with his portrayal of Group Captain Mandrake on loan from the RAF (&quot;Shoot, with the gun! That's what the bullets are for, you twit!&quot;), and his rather meek president Mertin Muffley (&quot;Get me Premiere Kissoff!&quot;).<p>James Earl Jones and Keenan Wynn have minor roles.<p>The one funky thing is the obvious fake flying bomber shots - a static model with rear-projection - but it is almost surely intentionally hokey. There are one or two other instances of this, such as the Coke spraying from the soda machine into &quot;Bat&quot; Guano's eye.<p>Even the style of the credits was unusual. Opening song &quot;Try A Little Tenderness&quot; over scenes of mid-air refueling airplanes, and closing song of &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; over scenes of....ha! you must see it.<p>Fantastic movie with good extras.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Implausible Action Story"></head><body><p>Die Hard, 1988 film<br /><br />The story begins with an airplane landing. One passenger carries a concealed weapon. He lights a cigarette. [That dates this story.] A woman makes a call to her home. The limo driver plays Christmas music. Mclane visits his wife in a tall office building. She has a new Rolex watch. A large truck enters a parking garage. Two criminals surprise the desk clerk. That truck is a "Trojan Horse"! Gates drop to lock entrances, elevators are disabled, telephone cables are cut. The gang has submachine guns, and gathers the party. The gang leader tells of his plans. He wants the head of the corporation. The gang leader demands the $640 million in bearer bonds from the safe. "Who said we were terrorists?" The gang leader is ruthless. Can they break the code to access the safe? Can a fire alarm bring help? Not if it is cancelled. "We are in charge." Then the elevator arrives with a passenger.<br /><br />Can a CB radio broadcast a Mayday on channel 9? Will they send a police car to investigate? There is a gunfight on the roof, three against one. Can the hero escape through an air duct? Yes. "Thanks for the advice." There is an event that warns the policeman, and he calls for assistance. Inconvenient timing? The gang leader gets bad news. Mclane sends news to the cops. A TV truck arrives to cover the news of the terrorists. There is subtle humor from the plans to invade. "They'll be coming." There are lights to show the building. "Send in the car." Can an anti-tank weapon stop it? Mclane drops a bomb in the elevator shaft. "It's him." Will one of the hostages betray Mclane? They want the detonators, Ellis says. A deal? No. Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson speaks to Hans Gruber. "Hello." "Who cares?" An author speaks about the "Helsinki Syndrome". A fantasy? "Not any more."<br /><br />Hans is a clever actor! Mclane runs a check. [This is too cute to be believed.] They shoot their guns as if their ammo was free. "Only John can drive somebody that crazy." Broken glass can cut bare feet. What will happen when they cut off power to that building? Will the government agents agree to the gang's demands? Will Mclane make a mistake? Will a TV reporter exploit two children? Helicopters arrive at the building. [The action builds towards the climax.] There is a terrific fight scene. The roof explodes! There is a final meeting between John and Hans. "Happy Trails." The ending is what you would expect from this action movie. [Are those the bearer bonds floating through the air?] Will a terrorist pop up for a dramatic ending? "He's with me." Holly answers that TV reporter.<br /><br />Can you see how this story was carefully crafted to appeal to a wide range of customers? Note how the story jabs at some authority figures in a crude way. The story has a failure in the over-elaborate plan to rob a safe. Too many hostages can identify the robbers. Being trapped in a tall building is a poor plan for any robber who wants to get away with the loot. [Did they issue untraceable bearer bonds in that era?] This story is "too clever by half", but worth watching once. The story about one man winning against great odds echoes "Red Harvest". The story of a gang taking over a business goes back to "The Painted Desert".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best crime films I have ever seen"></head><body><p>Mr. White ( Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange ( Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink ( Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blue ( Edward Bunker), and Mr. Brown ( Quentin Tarantino) are all perfect strangers that have been brought together by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney)to pull a simple diamond store heist. Unfortunately, when they show up, the cops are waiting for them and the simple robbery turns into a blood bath. Now this obviously means that they were set up. But no one knows which one of them is the police informant. The majority of the film involves introducing us to the characters and showing how they came to be involved, as well as flashbacks and flashforwards taking us through the day to watch the events unfold. <p>&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; marked the directorial debut of Quentin Tarantino, and I must say that it has to be one of the best film debuts that I have ever seen. The cast picked for this film was absolutely perfect. They all offer outstanding performances, and the film could not have succeeded without them. Tarantino was not only responsible for the direction of the film, but also wrote the flawless script. The script is brilliant. You have got a simple robbery gone wrong, that turns into a hard to solve mystery. Any man could be guilty. Not to mention the violence, which includes the infamous torture scene with Michael Madsen. The main reason this film succeeds, is that it shows what ordinary crime films keep out - the frustration when something goes wrong, the humor, and the clashing of egos between the criminals. The soundtrack to this movie is outstanding as well, and each song used fits each scene perfectly. <p>Overall, this is one of the best crime films that I have ever seen. The film is shot brilliantly taking us back and forth over the day of the robbery. This provides for tons of violence, a hard to solve mystery, and outstanding dialogue between the characters. This is the first crime film that I have seen that runs mainly on the personalities of the characters, and not the actual story. The DVD is great. The film was re-released with this Special 2 Disc Edition. Now you get deleted scenes, interviews with all of the cast, a tribute to Lawrence Tierney, and much more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great pot boiler when there is nothing else to watch"></head><body><p>This film is nothing to write home about, I'm glad I didn't go to the movies to see it but it was enjoyable enough to watch on DVD.<br /><br />Tom Hanks was a passable Robert Langdon, a bit wooden but okay, Audrey Tautou was a lot better as Agent Sophie Neveu, she gave a good rendition of fragility and strength in her role as the young woman whose own past is shrouded in secrecy, Paul Bettany was great as the haunted violent Monk Silas, and we had a cracking cameo appearance in Jurgen Prochnow as the corrupt bank official, along with Alfred Molina as the hard line voice of the Catholic Church and Opus Dei official.<br /><br />For me though the best two actors in the whole film were Jean Reno as the dogged French police officer who at first is convinced that Robert Langdon is guilty of murder but soon realises he is being played for a fool by the church and Ian McKellan as the monstrous Sir Leigh Teabing who has more secrets inside of him than Opus Dei itself.<br /><br />The movie doesn't follow Dan Brown's book exactly but what movie does?<br /><br />There are some good special effects, lots of spooky moments, eerie music and a mad dash around the world by Dr Langdon and Sophie as they work toward unravelling the greatest secret of Christendom, did Mary Magdalene actually marry Jesus Christ and did they have children whose descendents might still be living in the 21st century?<br /><br />There are the usual twists and turns, a sting in the tail so to speak and lots of clues, and codes to decipher.<br /><br />Not too gratuitously violent but it does have its moments and worth watching if you like a good old fashioned pot boiler of a thriller that was made on a mega budget.</p></body></html>

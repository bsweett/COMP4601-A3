<meta name="summary" content="Funny buddy comedy, a cleverly veiled chick flick, and somehow managed to promote The Rules"></head><body><p>What a great racket these two have going on!  Two lifelong friends, John and Jeremy, are professional wedding crashers.  Here they score free food, free champagne, and all the hot chicks they can get their sticky fingers on at all the weddings in town.  It doesn't matter in some situations that they are the only Anglos (the Indian wedding is funny) and obviously sticking out like proverbial sore thumbs, or that they are scamming people around them.  You laugh and pat them on the back, thinking why you didn't think of this yourself or how simple it could be if you were so crafty.  Eventually, John (Owen Wilson) falls for the sister of the bride at one of the society weddings they crash, and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) becomes the object of affection for another sister of the society bride whose insanity act and kinky antics leave you more fridgid than aroused.<br /><br />However, this movie fails to deliver.  I have a weakness for Owen Wilson, I admit it.  That broken nose just adds something to him that I find appealing.  Tee hee!  But, to see him using those lines on the gals at the weddings to bed them only to use them again when he at last falls for the perfect woman was disappointing.  Vince Vaughn is subjected to the majority of the physical comedy, and after a while it gets old.  Especially the closeted homosexual brother.  It just gets too obvious after a where the chain of events will go.  Once they are rejected they suddenly become the pursuers, proving the authors of The Rules might have been right all along.  Let him chase you, and then they will have more respect for you. (Although the Vince Vaughn / psycho sister situation is a little too twisted for words.)<br /><br />I was expecting a smutty, more slapstick humor (think the American Pie movies), but it turns into a chick flick on you before you know it.  Sappy ending, but Owen Wilson provided some nice eye candy.</p></body></html>

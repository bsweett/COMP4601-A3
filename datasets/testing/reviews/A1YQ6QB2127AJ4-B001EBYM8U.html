<meta name="summary" content="Denzel Washington at his best once again"></head><body><p>***Movie fact: "John Q" was filmed before "Training Day", but "Training Day" was released first because the producers felt that it's unusual for Denzel Washington to play a heartless villian.  They figured that if the audience didn't like him in that role, then "John Q" was to be the apology.<p>Denzel Washington needs no apologies for one of his best career performances in this wonderful action movie.  This is one of the more unique and the best police movies made in 2001.  It brilliantly desplicts the use and the dealing of narcotics.  This describes perfectly how to be a good and a bad cop.  <p>Washington deserved his second Oscar win for his portrayal of a criminal police officer, an unusual role for him.  This proves that the brilliant actor has many more monumental roles in the future.  Ethan Hawke deserved his first Oscar nomination as a cop in training trying to do the right thing.  Hopefully, Hawke is seen more often in the future in roles like this.  Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray prove in "Training Day" that they are talented outside of music.<p>The writers, the director, and the producers chose the perfect dark theme for this movie genre.  They make Washington's character's lifestyle as dark as it should be.  They desplict the drug houses and narcotic use as dirty as many of them are in real life.  They give Hawke's character the light that it deserves for being the good guy.  This combination blends with all events perfectly.<p>Those who are not used to such a unique movie may have to watch it twice to truly appreciate the quality.  The first watch may seem unproportioned.  The second watch will further understand all the scenes, therefore proportioning everything.</p></body></html>

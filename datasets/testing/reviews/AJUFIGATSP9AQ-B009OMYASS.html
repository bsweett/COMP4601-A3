Buckets of blood later has a clever, well done Hostel; which restrains itself in the most horrible; the horror that man does to man. Almost Neo-Noir Horror as the horny kids fall into a Holiday Hell, Euro style. The best of this type of film; Roth is fantastic : the photography and actors are real characters and have you along for the ride. Rough; but so was the Exorcist. A/V tops, Loud shaker, great widescreen, sound and photography. Rated NF (not for a lot of people)</p></body></html>

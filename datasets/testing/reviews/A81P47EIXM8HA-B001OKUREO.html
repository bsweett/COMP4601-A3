I was happy that Oliver Stone rushed this film into theaters in hopes that its extremely unfavorable painting of the current President would help John Kerry defeat him. Theater goers stayed away in droves....maybe due to the poor reviews maybe because they felt they were living it and too close (my reasoning)and others maybe pulled the plug on believing Oliver Stone could make anything relevant a decade before.<br /><br />Now that we have plenty of accurate accounts of the events portrayed in this film its clear it was historically wrong (a book could be written on that alone) and on top of that poor film making. Oliver Stone's cement style heavy handed approach seems directed to either left wing haters or those in the audience with IQs in the double digits. This story should, and still could, be done in a way which is less black and white and much much more in the mid tones. Stone's portrayal of these individuals is extremely one dimensional and often comical! For a glimpse at how ridiculous this movie is just listen to the actress playing Condi Rice for five seconds and you can get an accurate gauge on the entire movie.  These are real life people and yet the screenplay and movie inject less into them than a good movie with imagined characters!  How can you take this movie maker seriously when he refuses to inject any humanity into anybody in the story he does not like?<br /><br />Its almost impossible to make a movie of events while they are still unfolding...and Stone's joke of a film W. proves that. Stone is chasing relevance with his film making for some time  and continuing to fail....football, 911, George Bush,  and more recently Wall Street again.<br /><br />If he has to keep making movies perhaps he should find another Tarantino (who scripted Natural Born Killers) and just direct a brilliant script by somebody who actually HAS a voice. His chasing trends instead of setting them ...has failed.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy train wrecks and car crashes...because that is what this is.<br /><br />If you want to have fun at George W Bush's expense...then watch the hilarious Will Ferrell DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VEJK6Y">Will Ferrell: You're Welcome, America. A Final Night with George W. Bush</a>  Its much funnier than this joke.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Respect, Mr. Stone"></head><body><p>I remember Sep 11 like this: I was visiting in Shanghai, came to my hotel room in the evening, not so late, turned on CNN as usual, and saw a plane fly into one of the towers. It took me quite some time to understand what I had just seen. I called my wife and asked her to turn on TV at home. She had not heard yet.<br />I never felt more American than on that day.<br />I am German, by the way.<br />When I heard that Oliver Stone was making a movie about this, I could not believe it. Too early, too monumental, too emotionally loaded, too ideologically simple. This could only become a bad film.<br />It hasn't. It is a simple story about confusion and heroism and survival. Well done.<br />You never see a plane fly into anything. You only hear people talk about it, but there are also some who don't believe it. It shows you the segmented vision of people who are near the center. People watching TV in Shanghai probably knew more of what actually happened right at the time than those caught in the middle of it.<br />Stone stays away from explicit interpretation, he leaves that to the spectator.</p></body></html>

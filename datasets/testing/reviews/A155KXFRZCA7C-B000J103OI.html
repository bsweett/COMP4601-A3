<meta name="summary" content="Great Entertainment! Streep is excellent! More like 4 1/2 stars"></head><body><p>As usual, Meryl Streep delivers a most excellent performance. Also Anne Hathaway was very likeable and I think she did a great job. While Meryl plays the demanding Editor-in-Chief, Miranda Priestly, of a top-notch fashion magazine, she is not really as devlish as the title may indicate -- there are certainly far worse bosses around. Still, in a sense it's a type of comedy, but also with some serious undertones like e.g. dedicating your life to a professional career may ruin your personal life.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci is also superb -- too bad that he's so underrated. Tucci is an excellent actor and I wish he would show up in more films.<br /><br />This movie is certainly an enjoyable flick and it also gives some insight into the subjective and egocentric fashion business, but overall it's not to be taken too serious and it's even a spoof in some way. It's really a fun film and the quality acting really makes this film well worth watching.</p></body></html>

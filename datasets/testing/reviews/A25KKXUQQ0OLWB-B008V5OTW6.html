<meta name="summary" content="Quite a Story!"></head><body><p>This is a spy thriller in essence.  Based on the book Vengeance, an Israeli Body Guard to Golda Meir is engaged to assassinate conspirators in the kidnapping and murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  The main character uses many different aliases and travels throughout Europe to kill his targets.  It's an intriguing story and one that was never discredited as the truth.  I found the movie quite interesting but also confusing.  It is difficult to completely understand what is going on but I suspect that the main character and the other Israeli agents also felt that way.  The story is ambiguous in whether the mission helped Israel or harmed the country's long term peace goals.  It also highlights the intractable problem these two groups - israelis and Palestinians have with each other.  A very good movie to watch and learn from which can be entertaining at times, but very confusing and without a real ending - like real life.</p></body></html>

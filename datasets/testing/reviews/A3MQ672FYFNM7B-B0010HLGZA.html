This has always been my very favorite Christmas movie. As you may know there are about a zillion different "A Christmas Story" movie releases so although this review is about the movie, I will also be detailing the 2-disc DVD set that came out in 2003.<br /><br />I have fond memories of seeing "A Christmas Story" when it was still in the movies as a very young child. But this is the type of movie that everyone will love, it's not a movie just for children. The entire family will appreciate it.<br /><br />The story centers around Ralph Parker (Peter Billingsley) who longs for nothing more than a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. Ralph will stop at noting to get his Christmas-fix. Although the children in the movie were all very talented and funny, I think I liked the parents the most.<br /><br />The father is played by the late and much-loved Darren McGavin and the mom is portrayed by Melinda Dillon. I love the parents because everyone has parents like them. Mr. Parker always came home angry at the world, but just as angry and caustic as he was, that's how kind and loving Mrs. Parker was. I also loved the character of Randy (Ian Petrella) because he had to be at least 8 or 9, yet he was still being treated like a 2-year-old. That's classic and so hysterical.<br /><br />The coup de gr?ce has gotta be when Ralph goes buck-wild on Scut Farkus (Zack Ward). He just snapped and manages to get on top of the resident bully and just starts pummeling him with b-slaps, causing Farkus to start crying. I also love the part when Ralphie is forced to wear that hideous pink rabbit costume that his aunt sent him for Christmas. Because what child cannot relate to something similar happening; although I am sure nothing is as ludicruis as Ralph's bunny suit.<br /><br />Although the movie is shown during a 24-hour marathon every year I cannot think of a single reason why everyone should not own it. But, there are so many different releases, so it may be a little confusing to know which to choose. I prefer the 2-disc 2003 special edition set. Because it didn't cost much (that's most important and yes these are used but I couldn't care less) and because the packaging is great, it's looks like a Christmas gift (see the scans that I took the time to label and post) and it includes lots of bonuses and interviews. The 2003 2-disc set includes "A Christmas Story" in both pan and scan and letterbox, and the movie is remastered; making it appear just as fantastic as it sounds.<br /><br />If you're like me you will watch "A Christmas Story" over and over again during Christmastime because it's the perfect movie to welcome in the most joyous time of the year. Repeat the sounding joy.</p></body></html>

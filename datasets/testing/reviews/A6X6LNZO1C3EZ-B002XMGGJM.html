But that's not what makes it a good movie.  What makes it a good movie is there is just the precise amount left to the viewer's imagination, and most of the details are presented outright.  Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler out did themselves, and served up performances that uniquely fit together as properly as I've seen in a long, long time.  I like movies that are almost predictable but not entirely, and I like it when the bad guy is easy enough to hate that you don't mind when he gets what he deserves because they are demonstrated to be heinous criminals beyond rehabilitation - those type of people need justice upon them regardless of where it comes from.  The technical prowess of this film's gadgetry is impressive although not altogether believable.  There is enough graphic violence and gore, but not overdone.  There is about the right amount of cussing.  The movie's message is easy to relate to and the viewer can't help but get caught up in it a little bit.  Now for the reason I can't give this a full 5 stars.  The ending is wrong, and justice isn't served.  This needed to be a series, and not crammed into a single movie, and the ending needed changed.  For the record, just because somebody wears a business suit and carries a briefcase doesn't make them honest, just, have integrity, practice the Golden Rule, be charitable when deserved and/or harsh where deserved, nor does that business suit make them correct.  But one thing this movie drives home more than any other point is that if you don't have a serious resource of money, you can't fight back and the bullies have nothing to fear.  Unless you've fallen a few too many times which has made you eligible for a pneumatic refill and therefore you have no idea how to ferret out reality, truth, and facts (but at least you wouldn't care).  That said, 3 stars.</p></body></html>

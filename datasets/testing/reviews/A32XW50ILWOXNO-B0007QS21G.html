<meta name="summary" content="Never mind the &quot;political&quot; science."></head><body><p>Roland Emmerich learned his lesson.<br /><br /> The director, who was stung by critics and audiences when he drilled boredom into the first hour of &quot;Godzilla,&quot; packs the opening act of &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; with computer-generated mayhem: Giant tornadoes prowling Los Angeles, tidal waves flooding New York, volleyball-sized hail pummeling Tokyo. Global warning has triggered a massive, three-headed frozen hurricane descending from the North Pole.<br /><br /> Never mind the science. Or the politics. Just watch the destruction. It's epic and a little scary. Summer movies are about scale and spectacle and &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; rumbles with the best of them. The human element is average and the dialogue unmemorable. But the message - don't forget those Third-World countries, American capitalists - isn't bad and the actors - unlike those in &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Indepedence Day&quot; - are content to play it straight without pretention.<br /><br /> Dennis Quaid is Jack Hall, a weather scientist (paleoclimatologist if you want to get into it) warning the world's governments of impending metrological disaster while the American vice president (a Dick Cheney clone) scoffs. Cue up metrological disaster. Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhall) is in New York for an academic decathalon while Jack's wife (a wasted Sela Ward) burns midnight oil with a young cancer patient in Washington D.C. A third subplot involves Jack's Scottish colleague (Ian Holm) and his small team trapped in an observatory with the storm bearing down. Their findings help formulate an evacuation plan that, while belated, could manage to save some American lives.<br /><br /> The strength is the special f/x; in a year loaded with visual goodies, &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; actually deserves to be in the hunt come Academy Award time. The LA tornadoes is the movie's showpiece, a ten-minute, seven-funnel assault on the record and movie district. Though the movie drags in its second half - Sam indulges a crush on a brainiac ingenue (Emmy Rossum) while his father comes to rescue him - it finds a climax involving the eye of the storm at the deadly cold air inside it.<br /><br /> Conservative wags have lightly dismissed the picture (though not too harshly - it was released by Fox) but &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; ends on a hopeful note of global cooperation, a worthy aspiration should we face mass destuction (weather, weapons, or otherwise) in the near future.</p></body></html>

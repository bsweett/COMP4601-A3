<meta name="summary" content=""Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull" is excellent!"></head><body><p>"Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull" is excellent! This is how the story goes: In 1957, Indiana Jones is thrust back in action, venturing into the jungles of South America in a race against Soviet agents to find the mystical Crystal Skull. The cast led by Harrison Ford (returning in his signature role as Indiana Jones) is excellent! The directing by Steven Spielberg (who also directed the first 3 Indiana Jones films (1981, 1984, 1989) is excellent! The story (which is based on characters by George Lucas & Philip Kaufman) by Lucas (who also wrote the stories and screenplays to the "Star Wars" series and "Indiana Jones" movies) & Jeff Nathanson (who also wrote the screenplay to "Catch Me If You Can" (2002) & "The Terminal" (2004) and the screenplay by David Koepp (who also wrote the screenplay to "War Of The Worlds" (2005), "Spider-Man" (2002), "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (1997), & "Jurassic Park" (1993) is excellent! The music by John Williams (who also did the music to all 3 Indiana Jones movies and many of Spielberg's other movies) is excellent! The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (who has done the cinematography to Spielberg's films since "Schindler's List" (1993) is excellent! The film editing by Michael Kahn (who also did the film editing to all 3 Indiana Jones movies and many of Spielberg's other movies) is excellent! The casting by Debra Zane (who also did the casting to "War Of The Worlds", "The Terminal", & "Catch Me If You Can") is excellent! The production design by Guy Hendrix Dyas (who also did the production design to "X2" (2003) & "Superman Returns" (2006) is excellent! The art direction by Luke Freeborn (who also did the art direction to the upcoming "Star Trek" (2009), Lawrence A. Hubbs (who also did the art direction to "Superman Returns"), Mark W. Mansbridge, Lauren E. Polizzi (who also did the art direction to "The Lost World: Jurassic Park"), & Troy Sizemore (who also did the art direction to the upcoming "Terminator 4" (2009) is excellent! The set decoration by Larry Dias (who also did the set decoration to "Transformers" (2007) & Alyssa Winter is excellent! The costume design by Mary Zophres (who also did the costume design to "Catch Me If You Can" & "The Terminal") is excellent! This is an excellent return after 19 years of absence. Ford is back and still in great shape to play Indy. This is just as great as the last 2 Indiana Jones films in the franchise. This is also one of the best films of the summer so far.</p></body></html>

No...<br /><br />However, the movie had really good character development<br />and while it started out as a boxing movie, it became alot<br />more in the second half of the movie. Then it really hits<br />you what the movie is all about. Clint and Maggie become<br />so close and it seems as time passes by Clint starts to<br />forget about the real daughter that ignores him and Maggy<br />starts to become his daughter. It's about a relationship<br />and a womans will to do more than what is expected of her.<br /><br />Now, I think Clints problems with his daughter could possibly<br />have been brought to more light and perhaps Maggie winning<br />so easy throughout was alittle overdone... Also, the ending<br />can be argued as if it's right or wrong. But I believe these<br />are things that can be looked over.<br /><br />The movie delivered without using B movie clich&eacute;'s and un<br />needed music to help provide drama. It felt real and every<br />body in the movie done a good job. It's hard to do the<br />second half without getting overdramtic, but Clint managed<br />to do it.<br /><br />Oh, and for the guy... below... This movie is much better<br />than action flick Dirty Harry. Sorry. People need to realize<br />that Clint is doing different things now. It's ashame that<br />some of his older fans have tried to pigeon hole him as a<br />cowboy or action star. Those days are most likely over and<br />you need to realize that.<br /><br />Some of the reviews here are just moronic. Some complaining<br />because it doesn't have a happy ending. Personally, I'm<br />alittle tired the endless movies were everything and everyone<br />is happy. Those movies come a dime a dozen and several come<br />out every year. Not need to take moronic jabs at this one<br />for actually being different.<br /><br />We also have people complaining about the extra features.<br />Those are just freakin icing on the cake. So what if they<br />aren't great... Who buys a DVD for the extra features any<br />way? Sheesh! I can understand the ones that complain about<br />the ending, but these other people complaining about things<br />of such little importance are morons.<br /><br />Another Rocky? This movie takes a crap all over any of the<br />predictable feel good Rocky movies.</p></body></html>

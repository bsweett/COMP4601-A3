<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant performance that reminds of The Insider"></head><body><p>Rusell Crowe comes back with an outstanding performance that brings back to mind his role in Michael Mann's "The Insider," where he played the role of a former executive from a tobacco company that becomes persecuted by the company because how much he knew. This time around, he plays the role of mathematician John Nash, a brilliant mind who stands out of the rest of his peers while he attended Princeton. This put him in a position where he was bound to be involved with the Department of Defense in Top Secret operations, as "the world's best natural code-braker." However his mind plays games with him and drives him down a cliff of paranoia, ending up diagnosed with schizophrenia. His trip back from this problem with the help of his loving wife Alicia (played by beautiful Jennifer Connelly -"Requiem for a Dream") takes a central place in the movie, until he learns to live with the visions of his past that surround him while he gets in touch once again with what's real in life...<p>A movie with a beautiful message of what's possible with the help of love and determination. See it. You will like it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not for the gentle spirit"></head><body><p>Ignore the star power in this movie, if you can. Michael Caine, David Bowie, Christian Bale, Piper Perabo, Hugh Jackman, and Scarlett Johansson are hard to ignore, but try anyway. Also, ignore the low-key action of the movie, until you can't any more. This is about aggression that goes way beyond any normal violence. Even without the supernatural, these people can't be stopped by mere murder - or suicide.<br /><br />I can't say much, because almost anything would be a spoiler. When you get to the last scene, all you'll want is to see the rest all over again. It really does build up, moment by moment, in an utterly logical progression that conceals its logic. There is one deus ex machina at work, but only one. The rest seems inevitable, but only when you look back from the very end.<br /><br />It's intense, and just scratches the surface of a rage that gentle people will not understand. It builds slowly - I almost walked out about an hour into it. It finishes hard and fast, though. It reminds me of "Realm of the Senses," not in its sensuality, but in its cold, hard drive for revenge.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

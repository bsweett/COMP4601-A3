A powerful film that uses textured, mature acting and a story that cuts at its characters as its probes its own plot. Director Clint Eastwood is may bot be the most flashiest filmmaker out there, but his style feels as if it has evolved with experience and trial and error. Each shot looks and feels as if it has been set up by a skilled master of the game, and one who knows how to handle the story of &quot;Mystic River,&quot; adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane.<br /><br /> Three friends from urban Boston (a dynamic acting trio of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon) share a history. One that involves kidnapping and sexual abuse. As adults they have drifted apart, but when Jimmy's (Penn) daughter is discovered murdered, they come back together again as Sean (Bacon) is the cop assigned to the case Dave (Robbins) slowly becomes the prime suspect. Surprisingly, there is a lot of ground to cover, detailing Jimmys' chekered past as well as Dave dealing with his own wicked experience as a boy. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland (L.A.Confidential) does so with a clarity and even-handedness that proves invaluable. No major plot detail goes without being explained, and in a way that doesn't distract from the main murder mystery.<br /><br /> Eastwoods' supporting cast is equally stellar as the three leads. Marcia Gay Harden is haunting as Dave's wife, exuding subtle terror and fear that preludes the film's tragic two-pronged climax. Laura Linney has but a small part as Jimmey's wife but she makes an impact in the parade scene that ends the movie. The one real surprise of the film is Laurence Fishburne. For all of us who thought he was the walking dead in the ill-advised &quot;Matrix&quot; sequels, here he is a sly, humorous partner for Bacon, as well as being a great foil for the star in the scenes they share. Eastwood, however, makes the film. His style, though workmanlike, is masterful. He knows how to use the actors at his disposal and when he is at his best, he knows how to make a story deeply emotionally resonant, especially here with Helgeland's shrewd script. &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a film that you may not see often anymore, but it's one to be remembered.</p></body></html>

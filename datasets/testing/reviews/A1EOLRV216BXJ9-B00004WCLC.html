<meta name="summary" content="Has its gripping moments"></head><body><p>The movie opened with 3 curious incidents of coincidence in the past. The first hour then unfolded the backgrounds of 2 dying men, his daughter, a policeman, his son, a nurse, their wives and 2 prodigy at TV quiz show.<br /><br />The second hour saw the important decisions these people made. At one point, the camera shifted to and fro among 6 (or more) stories against a pulsating music background. The pace and grip closed in, leading the audience to yearn for more. The heavyweight character actors executed their parts beautifully and the shots were well-sequenced, successfully building up an atmosphere of urgency, I found Julianne Moore at the pharmacy store a mesmerizing performance. She was so beautiful yet cold, quiet yet restless, until her sudden outburst of spitting venom bespoke her guilt-ridden state.<br /><br />The last hour wrapped up only after a bizarre natural disaster, forcing the characters to a closure and a reflection of their chaotic lives. Without the improbable disaster, it would not be convincing that these people, all suffer from a relationship crisis, would alter their paths, heading for a better future.<br /><br />There is just a fine line between stories of clich&eacute;s-pretensions and sincerity. Even more difficult to cook all these stories in the same pot and still make sense. Nowadays books and movies (Clash, Babel, Friends with money) choose to dart from one short story to another on relationships which are supposed to be subtly related. Not all come off with a success though. At least this movie can be given the benefit of the doubt of being original and it displayed sincerity as well as good directing. Yes, the movie can be slow at some point but it had its gripping moments. It had thus gained enough momentum to drive the story to a more than satisfying ending.</p></body></html>

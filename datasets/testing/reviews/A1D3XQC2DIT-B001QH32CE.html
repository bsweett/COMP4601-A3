<meta name="summary" content="An inspiring movie to never overlook your own happiness."></head><body><p>Jenna (Keri Russell) would like nothing more than to pack her few belongings and move away. She has never been truly appreciated -- especially by her controlling husband -- despite her talent. Jenna makes pie. And there is an upcoming pie contest with a grand prize that would allow her to finance her escape.<br /><br />Reading and thinking about the synopsis of this movie would probably lead you, as it did me, towards an expectation of a sad movie. But if you watch it, you will find a more uplifting and empowering story about a woman who is finally ready to do things that make her happy.<br /><br />The movie had its rough spots just about any time Jeremy Sisto was on screen. He played the controlling husband and his scenes were hard to watch. I have noticed that there is a distinct category of people who did not like this movie based solely on Sisto's character. I find that unfortunate since there was a very charming story here, but I can appreciate the viewpoint of anyone who fits that category.<br /><br />Waitress was very well written. There were many great lines delivered by various members of the cast, but Andy Griffith stole the show. He played Old Joe, the man who owned the pie diner where Jenna worked. He was a crotchety old man who was nice to no one...except Jenna. He played a valuable role serving as her mentor and conscience and was a key ingredient to my enjoyment of the movie.</p></body></html>

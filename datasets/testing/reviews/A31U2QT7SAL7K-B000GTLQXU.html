Perhaps, by having two familiar faces, Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss, the director wants the audience to fill in the blanks about their respective characters.  Russell's is possibly an extension of the character that he played in "Backdraft" inasmuch as in this film he's a former New York firefighter turned mayor; Dreyfus is, perhaps, "Matt Hooper" from "Jaws," after the great white scared him out of the closet.  Both actors didn't seem to stretch their acting muscles much in this film.<br /><br />As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, Josh Lucas's "reformation" from professional gambler to savior of the group is almost believable, considering the predicament in which the survivors find themselves.  Though he has more lines than original "captain" Leslie Neilson, Andre Braugher doesn't get too much screen time and "goes down with the ship,"...literally.<br /><br />Because of the brevity of character development, the rest of the cast is filled out with your basic stereotypes: the single mom and son (Jacinda Barrett and Jimmy Bennett), the young couple (Emmy Rossum and Mike Vogel), the stowaway (Mia Maestro), the wise-ass (Kevin Dillon), and the noble crewman (Freddy Rodriquez).<br /><br />The special effects are indeed spectacular but more than thirty years have passed since the first film and it's logical that there would be an improvement in that area.  However, the first one benefited from having characters of whom the audience could connect.  By going "straight for the jugular" with the massive effort spent on CGI effects and stuntwork, Peterson has crafted a nice-looking package but with nothing inside.<br /><br />And even the original had a nifty John Williams' score; Klaus Bedelt's does not compare, even to his own superlative score to the hit "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."<br /><br />The film does have one great bonus: the sinking of the ship at the film's end.  That is a most likely occurence, considering the massive damage inflicted on the ship by the "rogue wave."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Really Funny Comedy, Sparkling Performances!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best comedies of the 90's. It is extremely entertaining and features perfect performances by an all-star cast. Jack Nicholson really shines as Melvin Udall, a role he was born to play. Helen Hunt and  Greg Kinnear are also brilliant as Carol the waitress and Simon the f@g,  respectively. James L. Brooks manages to write a refreshingly funny  screenplay with perfectly drawn characters. It has some great insights on  what lonelyness can do to a man and how relationships with other people can  change your life. Extremely entertaining comedy. From a scale of 1-10 I  give this film an 8!</p></body></html>

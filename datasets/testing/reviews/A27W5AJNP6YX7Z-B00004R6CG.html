<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock's masterpiece?"></head><body><p>So apparently this movie was a miserable failure at the box office and it was only years and years later that it was regarded as one of Hitchcock's greatest films. Why? Because we audiences of today are oh so much more sophisticated than the silly people of back then, who just didn't get it. (Oh, and something about how it was personal to Hitch.) Well, I have to say I disagree. While there are still good movies made today, I sadly have to opine that the art of the film has seriously deteriorated.<br /><br />That said, while I find this movie fascinating, it is not my favorite Hitchcock film. I've seen it a few times and maybe I just need to see it a few more to get all the subtleties. But honestly, it is probably more the subject matter - the poor treatment of women - that kept me from enjoying this film fully. Normally, the excellent acting, intense suspense, intriguing plot, and amazing camera work would be enough to overcome all that. But I don't know. It was just so... disturbing. Jimmy Stewart was always so pleasant, the guy next door. This role was such a departure for him, and he was very convincing. My goodness, what a creep. Making over his new girlfriend to resemble the woman he was in love with! Frankly I thought Kim Novak was more attractive as the second woman, with the darker hair she wore down around her shoulders, and the more colorful clothing. I can sort of understand why she was willing to change for him, because she was already in love with him. But seriously... what if she had stayed with him the first time? Would she have never been able to change for the entire rest of her life?<br /><br />But then, this movie probably intended to make us think and ask questions. In that, it really succeeded.</p></body></html>

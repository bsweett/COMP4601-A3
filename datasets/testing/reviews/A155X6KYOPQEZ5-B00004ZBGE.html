A planet where apes capture humans and use them for game.<br /><br />I really loved this version of the Planet of the Apes. I actually liked this one better than the 2001 version. (even though it looks more realistic) If you are a planet of the apes fan and liked the 2001 version, you may think well I don't want to see the old version! But this version really isn't that bad!</p></body></html>

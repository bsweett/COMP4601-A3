<meta name="summary" content="A HISTORY LESSON ON FILM"></head><body><p>One can't deny the visual beauty of Terrence Malick's films.  His camera captures glorious vistas, and beautiful lighting.  I found THE NEW WORLD, however, ultimately a dull, laborious history lesson.  Too much use of visuals, stilted dialogue, long unnecessary scenes, repetitive in nature, and even the action scenes seemed lethargic and unimaginative.<br /><br />Q'oriana Kilcher's performance as Pocahontas is the strongest one in the film; she has a stunning presence and uses her silences effectively.  Colin Farrell seems lost in his role as John Smith and Christian Bales and Christopher Plummer are lost in their brief roles.<br /><br />The movie is too long and tedious, and not one of my favorite recent films at all.</p></body></html>

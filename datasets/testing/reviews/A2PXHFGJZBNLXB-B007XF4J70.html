<meta name="summary" content="Great Hollywood entertainment (if not much more than that)"></head><body><p>Obviously there is a lot of hype about this old movie, calling it &quot;one of the greatest films ever made&quot; and all that. My opinion on the hype is this: there are plenty of films out there that have more psychological insight into its characters and explore deeper themes than CASABLANCA does. Despite the fact that it uses a wartime setting and has a cast of various nationalities, it merely uses these elements as a backdrop to a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama. The whole thing is basically safe old-style Hollywood entertainment, but that's really all it is. Nothing more, nothing less. (CASABLANCA is a film that would probably appeal more to older people who feel nostalgia for the &quot;golden age&quot; of Hollywood than to us progressive younger folk.) To call this film &quot;one of the best films of the cinema ever&quot; would be a gross overstatement of its quality, in my opinion. To me, CASABLANCA is hardly that, and I would not rate this high on my own personal list of the greatest films I've ever seen.<br /><br /> The reason I give this movie five stars, though, is that, as old-style Hollywood entertainment, it is pretty glorious. Here is a romantic melodrama that actually had me interested in its characters and situations from roughly beginning to end. The screenwriters and director Michael Curtiz never make the central romantic tensions overblown in any way (something that GONE WITH THE WIND did, to its detriment I think). It all remains nicely down-to-earth, and the actors help make it convincing and fun to watch, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the lead roles. Bogart, especially, does a good job with bringing out the sides of his character Rick Blaine, a man who outwardly shows cynicism and indifference, but deep inside still has feelings for Ilsa Lund and really does want to help her and her husband escape the country. (His final sacrificial act at the end of CASABLANCA is one of the most sublime things Hollywood has ever dreamed up.) And of course no discussion of this movie could dare to skip over the now-classic dialogue of this movie, which remains nicely edgy and flavored. (I particularly liked Rick's response to the officer who asks about his nationality, as well as his &quot;I stick my head out for nobody&quot; philosophy.) All in all, here is a romantic movie that never gets soapy, and its honesty of feeling is something to be truly admired.<br /><br /> CASABLANCA remains, to this day, an example of Hollywood entertainment at its skillful best. It doesn't have ambitions to be anything other than diverting, and on that level it succeeds magnificently. Just don't come into the movie expecting &quot;the greatest movie you'll ever see.&quot; Recommended.</p></body></html>

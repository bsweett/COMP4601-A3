Set in working class Boston, it tells the story of two childhood friends (Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon) who are emotionally scarred after witnessing the abduction of another friend, Dave (Tim Robbins).  As adults, Jimmy (Penn) is an ex-con trying to make a decent living with his wife Annabeth (Laura Linney), while Sean (Bacon) is a homicide detective.  But when Jimmy's daughter is suddenly killed, a murder mystery soon unfolds and Sean is soon called upon to investigate the case.  While much has been made of &quot;Mystic River&quot;'s cinematography, the film's power lies in the performances, all of which are stunningly good.  Expect yet another Oscar nomination for Sean Penn, who vividly brings to life the agony of a mourning parent desperate to seek revenge for the murder of his child.  The solid Marcia Gay Harden also deserves props for her role as Dave's wife Celeste.  But the real star of the show is definitely the 73-year-old Eastwood, who no doubt made his best film in years.  You can run to the multiplex to catch a big budget movie that's louder and flashier. But in terms of dramatic tension, believable performances, and a witty script, &quot;Mystic River&quot; is so far the movie to beat in 2003.</p></body></html>

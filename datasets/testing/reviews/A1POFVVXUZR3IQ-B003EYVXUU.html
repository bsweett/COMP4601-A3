<meta name="summary" content="The story of an old soul and a lost boy"></head><body><p>"Let Me In" is the Hollywood remake of "Let the Right One In", a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but both the original film and remake managed to handle these multiple themes in a credible manner.<br /><br />The remake is not exactly faithful to the original, and viewers who have watched both will notice the differences such as the opening scene, the changes in characterization for some of the minor characters, etc. For the most part though, the remake focuses on the essential parts of the story just as in the original and makes for riveting viewing. This is not the movie to watch if you're looking for pretty vampires smooching around, or a splatterfest with non-stop action. There's hints of a romance, slowly simmering, a mixture of Gothic and sweet teenage love, and there's also lots of blood, but by no means does this movie careen along - it takes its time developing the characters, drawing viewers into this strange, dark world where nothing is at it appears, and focuses viewers' attention on the two main characters.<br /><br />The story is of teenager Owen [Kodi Smit-McPhee] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Owen doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Owen meets a strange girl named Abby [Chloe Moretz] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Abby has just moved into the apartment next door to Owen's with a man Owen thinks is her dad. Despite Abby's words, the pair are drawn to each other, and form a real friendship. For a while at least, Owen remains blissfully unaware of the dark secret hidden by Abby and her `dad'.<br /><br />"Let Me In" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Owen and Abby manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role. The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire. Abby is a young-looking  yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.<br /><br />"Let Me In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see. The film is rated R, with Spanish subtitles, and English subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired. The film is in color, and the running time is 115 minutes. Special features include an audio commentary with director Matt Reeves; a feature titled From the Inside: A Look At The Making of Let Me In; The Art of Special Effects; Car Crash Sequence Step-By-Step; Deleted Scenes; Trailer Gallery; and, a Poster Gallery.</p></body></html>

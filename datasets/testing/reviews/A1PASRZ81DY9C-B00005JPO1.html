<meta name="summary" content="Boring and So Anti-Indiana Jones."></head><body><p>Viewed: 11/08<br />Rate: 1<br /><br />11/08: I feel like I went blind after seeing Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull (sheesh, what a long title or perhaps there are just too many syllables). Granted, this fourth installment should have not been made in the first place, and it's best to let the series die because Harrison Ford is just simply too old. Another reason is that, of course, a film made in 2008 would mainly involve a lot of CGI crap. That's just killing the feeling of the picture &aacute; la Live Free or Die Hard (or simply Die Hard 4). Basically, everything of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull is anti-Indiana Jones, and that's the worst part of the movie. I am not sure if the DVD is defective or that's the way how the producers wanted the film to be viewed, but I gotta say, my eyes felt like they were being forced to be crossed due to its ultra sharpness of the picture. That really gave me a headache after some period of time, and I had to turn the movie off to take a break. Again, because of the CGI crap, the action and everything that was going on in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull felt completely artificial. Having typed that, I felt a huge yearning to see again any of the three films: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, or Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. All of the characters in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull sucked to the nth degree, and I never felt like I was having fun like the other three films, which is a major disappointment. The biggest question of the movie is: why? Obviously, like I've said before, money had to be made. It's so disappointing to see quality being compromised to satisfy greed. Much of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull is recycled scenes, ideas, concepts, actions, and tidbits from the previous three films, so that's a strong indication that nobody could come up with anything so original. What's with the fake animals? How hard is it to shoot a real animal with an actual handheld camera? As for the plot of the film, what plot? I was like, "Oh okay...whatever," by the time Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull ended. It was like a great big...nothing. What happened to the good, true old fashioned filmmaking that I love? What happened to the good, true old fashioned stunt work that I love? What happened to the good, true old fashioned explosions that I love? Man, The Road Warrior and Mad Max are great examples of once lost art examples of what I am talking about. Who cares if they cost money? At least, be realistic as possible. *sighs* What's the point anymore? All in all, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull is 100% pure crap.</p></body></html>

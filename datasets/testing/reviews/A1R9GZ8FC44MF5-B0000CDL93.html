This film says it all, and even though it is quite long it keeps you interested all the way through and never gets boring.  This is bursting with facts and shocking truths, and is more suspensful then any thriller out there.  The performances are also notably good, and even though Costner is an avergae actor at best, he impressed me with this, and actually had me tearing at the end, because he spoke the truth.  Its powerful, well crafted, very well directed, well acted, all around great film making.  Its not for the weak of heart because you see JFK get shot in the head numerous times and see very clearly what actually happened.  JFK was a good president and if he wasnt assassinated would have done many more great things for america, like stop the vietnam war (My father is a vietnam veteran, and he deserves better then what that idiot Bush is doin for him right now).  This is Stones best film so far, but i think Alexander is probably gonna be better since he has been working on it for years, and Stone is a great director.  I highly recommend seeing this film and Fareinghit 9/11 (sorry if i spelled it wrong) if you have a brain and truly want to understand how screwed up our government is.  10 out of a 10.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock at his trippiest......."></head><body><p>VERTIGO remains one of the most thought-provoking films I have ever seen.  I still remember my first taste of this film (at least thirteen years ago!).  It's safe to say (without exaggeration) that it changed my life and how I view cinematography.  Yes, I know that is a tall statement to make about this movie, but it's well-merited.  Why?  For starters, Alfred Hitchcock's depiction of the medical condition of vertigo (extreme dizziness onset by perceived or actual drops in height--example:  standing at the top of a tall staircase and glancing down at the ground floor from where you stand) feels like, both, a deep acid trip (complete with spinning imagery and disorientation), as well as a really extreme look at the effect of this condition on Scotty (James Stewart), a retired policeman, hired by an old friend to follow his beautiful wife (Kim Novak) who believes is possessed by the dead soul of a mad woman.  Of course, this woman also has a penchant for ascending to great heights and attempting to jump off of them.  This only adds another twist to Scotty's pursuit of the woman.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock always had a flair for bringing the ironic, gothic and darkly comedic all to the foreground, in his films.  Cinematography was one way he achieved (and manipulated) these emotions in the stories he wove so eloquently, on screeen.  VERTIGO is no exception.  What's more, Kim Novak is a very compelling and beautiful actress who stepped out of her more "cheesecake" roles to play the role of Madeleine, a very deeply disturbed (and perhaps, psychologically pursued?) woman with a secret.  What's more, I love James Stewart, here.  His relationship with Madeleine is conflicted and borders on pseudo-erotic.  Of course, I won't divulge more plot details here.  I just figured dropping that clue would tease and tantalize you enough to want to see this great film for yourself.  I am so glad that it was given the kudos it deserved, with a re-released DVD addition.  Great news!!!</p></body></html>

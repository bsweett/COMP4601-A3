<meta name="summary" content="The Terror at Talbot Hall"></head><body><p>The Wolfman, 2000 film<br /><br />The story begins with a full moon in 1891 Blackmoor England. A man wanders at night, alone and unarmed. He is attacked by a wild creature. Gwen Conliffe is engaged to Ben, she asks his brother the actor about the missing Ben. Larry Talbot knows nothing. On the train a stranger offers him a silver-headed cane with a canine head. A two-horse coach carries Larry to the estate. [No servants?] A large dog barks at him. Sir John Talbot tells him the news about finding Ben's body. Did a wild beast do that? Were the foreign Gypsies responsible? Could it be a werewolf? Words in the inn lead to turmoil. Are the villagers ignorant and superstitious? [Why do they suspect the aristocracy?] Do actors pretend to be somebody they are not? A strange medallion was found on Ben's body.<br /><br />Larry remembers his mother's death. [Symbolism?] Larry was sent out of the country (to explain his American accent). There is another full moon. Larry goes to the Gypsy camp to inquire about that medallion. "Mazel Tov?" Mounted riders with arms enter the camp. Something attacks the men? Gunshots are useless. Larry runs after the canine: it attacks him! There is no cure for one bitten by the beast. Larry recovers at home, remarkably well. A warrior must be armed against evil, even with silver bullets. A policeman investigates the crime, Larry alone survived. There are no natural predators left in England. Could it be a lunatic? A group of men try to capture Larry on suspicion. Is a stranger dangerous?<br /><br />Larry orders Gwen to leave by nightfall. Is she in danger? The villagers cast silver bullets. The police detective waits in the village inn. Is Talbot Hall cursed (like the Baskervilles)? Why does Sir John visit the crypt at night? What does his talk tell? Larry undergoes a change in personality. The villagers hear a howl. Can they trap this beast? Who is caught? The werewolf attacks the crowd of men, impervious to gun shots. Can it be captured? Can ice water cure insanity? Or electric shock? Will Larry hallucinate? Sir John tells about his adventure in India, and its after effects. [Were you surprised?]<br /><br />Larry is brought before a group of doctors for an examination about his delusions. [Note the amazing special effects from computer generated images.] Was this meant as a comedy? And so Larry is free to run over the rooftops like a wild animal. Pistol shots have no effect! [Too bad for anyone where the bullets land.] Gwen finds Larry, he tells the family secrets (a hereditary disease). The police detective questions Gwen about Larry. Gwen read up on "Lycanthropy". Will she "set him free"? The police will shoot Larry on sight. Larry goes hunting too. Will there be a surprise? Can a werewolf defeat another werewolf? [More amazing special effects. Does this remind you of professional wrestling?] Will fire kill a werewolf? Or a silver bullet? The spell is broken, Larry is set free to go to a far, far better place. But what about that police detective who was bitten? ["Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde".]<br /><br />This is inferior to the 1941 original movie, which had more integrity. This version runs on too long with its extraneous scenes. Its great special effects got in the way of the story. I read that Curt Siodmak, the original writer, concocted those legends of werewolves (silver bullet, etc) which became part of popular beliefs. Check the references to "silver bullet" in popular culture. The original story was a parable about the economic cycle that regularly brought hard times.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Musical That Works"></head><body><p>Bob Fosse's "Chicago" is a spectacular and naughty musical.  Two Showgirls (Rene'e Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones) are put in the slammer for each murdering their lovers.  Their crimes of passion are presented as petty, but predictable in the Windy City during the Jazz Age.  The only regrets they have are the gallows, and their only deliverance is a greedy and conceited lawyer (played by Richard Gere).  Even though the women are desperate, they also crave the publicity that oddly gets them help from the papers if they know how to use it.<br /><br />The drama moves from the prison to the stage where the singers unbear their souls for each key scene.  The numbers and choreography are steamy and smooth, and the story is entertaining.  The performances are good, but don't require any subtlety.  Queen Latifah is particularly fun as the female warden.  The scenes are interspersed well and flow at a good pace.  There is some cynicism in the story, but the playful antics overshadow the darker elements of the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprising Ending? There's A Whole Load Full Of Similar Movies Like This."></head><body><p>The actors are great, only problem is that the movie didn't ultilize their full potential. As in surprise ending, predicted it in the beginning and firmed my prediction after 30 minutes. Nowadays audience are harder to trick, more or less I suppose, because of the many movies out now. Most ideas that movies base themselves on, plots, settings, etc are already taken in past movies. Its very hard finding originals nowadays and still there's no definate originals even if they try. I'm already seeing a limit to songs as it is. Nowadays, people just remake songs over again to bring it back, other words? They're running out of ideas.<br /><br />I did sort of got scared in some parts, but again its just the surprise and not really anything else.<br /><br />You should watch this if you want to know whats it about etc, because its not a HORRIBLE and totally time wasting movie since they do have to great actors in there, its just not all that great. Enjoy.</p></body></html>

Transporter 2 fails somewhat, as it's rated a PG13, instead of an R, which would have been so much better. If it had been rated an R, it might have turned out better. It wasn't shockingly bad - but then again, NOTHING can live up to Jason Statham on a motorbike, in a hospital gown, with the wind blowing.<br /><br />The story's different to the original, but it weakens it a bit, cos you seem to think Frank has come over all soft, 'babysitting' a little boy, for some unknown reason which didn't help. His dad is some big shot, the mother's lonely and more than happy to make sure Frank is doing OK. But there is no major love interest unlike the first Transporter.<br /><br />Kate Nauta, as Lola, the ultra skinny, ultra blonde chick (so much so that she looks like the chick from the group Roxette) was a big mistake in this film. It puts all women off watching it. Not only does she spend nearly all her screen time in lingerie and little else, but then she goes and gets wet. How original. She's very offputting throughout the entire film, and that failed for me. She probably HATED the director for putting her through that, plus, I could probably do my ironing on her stomach.<br /><br />The kid is injected with a virus, that will kill anyone who breathes it. But we don't discover this until what, the last 15 minutes in the movie? Plot lines are forgotton about quite quickly in this movie, and there is still some stuff at the end that doesn't quite come together. Which is disappointing.<br /><br />Although I did enjoy Transporter 2, I would suggest you to stick to the first film, or Crank. Hubba hubba.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A  really over the top spoof of local news coverage."></head><body><p>It does give you the idea, that network news picks the best & leaves the chimps to do local news & cover irrelevant & banal features. The gags are geared to a six-year old. Too obvious for an adult. It reminds me of Late Night with David Letterman. He has a brain-fart & it falls falt. He thinks it will become funny if he repeats it three or four times, then explains the joke. No. Only his fool, Paul Schaefer laughs. Anchorman gives you escapist fare & you'll find yourself predicting what will happen next. Will Farrell sharpened his acting skills since then, but not much. The gang fight with all the local news teams is the funniest scene. That's about it.</p></body></html>

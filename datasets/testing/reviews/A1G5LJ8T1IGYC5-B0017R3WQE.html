IN THIS ONE, A CUBAN IMMIGRANT [AL PACINO] COMES TO AMERICA WITH THE HOPES OF EARNING A SUCCESSFUL LIVING. SOON, HE BEGINS TO EARN THAT LIVING THROUGH COCAINE DEALING. WHAT A MOVIE! AL PACINO WAS SERIOUSLY ROBBED AT THE OSCARS FOR THIS EPIC GANGSTER MOVIE! HOW COULD THE PEOPLE AT THE OSCARS IGNORE PACINO'S PERFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE? RIGHT ASIDE FROM THE GODFATHER, THIS IS THE 2ND GREATEST GANGSTER MOVIE EVER MADE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, MANY CRITICS HAVE GIVEN THIS MOVIE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS MOVIE DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT WELL AT THE BOX OFFICE. BUT, REGARDLESS OF ALL THAT, THIS IS A MUST-SEE MOVIE AND EVERY MOVIE FAN SHOULD HAVE THIS IN THEIR DVD COLLECTION. THIS MOVIE WILL REMAIN A CLASSIC FOR YEARS TO COME. THIS VERSION OF THE SCARFACE DVD HAS ALL NEW EXTRAS, INCLUDING A 20 MINUTE DOCUMENTARY IN WHICH RAPPERS TALK ABOUT HOW THIS MOVIE HAS INSPIRED THEM AND THEIR MUSIC. GET THIS DVD NOW! AND IF FOR SOME REASON YOU STILL HAVEN'T SEEN IT, YOU SHOULDN'T RENT THIS, YOU SHOULD BUY THIS. IF YOU'RE GONNA OWN ONE DVD, IT HAS TO BE THIS ONE!</p></body></html>

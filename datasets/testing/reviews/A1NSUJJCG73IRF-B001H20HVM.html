<meta name="summary" content="Saw II  (2005)"></head><body><p>Director:  Darren Lynn Bousman<br /><br />Cast:  Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, Franky G, Glenn Plummer, Dina Meyer, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Beverly Mitchell, Erik Knudsen.<br /><br />Running Time:  93 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for grisly violence and gore, terror, language and drug content.<br /><br />Sequels, with a few exceptions, have a tendency to be very bad. In the wake of all this being let down by them, many critics were initially unimpressed with the idea of a clever little horror film like "Saw" to have a sequel. It seemed like too much of a way to cash in a successful revenue and good reception of the original and while this one isn't as good it is a formidable continuation.  "Saw II" does everything wrong that the first film did right. First of all, this film tells the story of a group of eight random people inside one of Jigsaw's "Fun houses", if you will, with a dangerous nerve gas slowly creeping into their systems. They only have 3 hours to find a way out, or they all die. Now, what made the first film great is that it built tension and suspense on the fact that everything was a mystery. The two men locked inside of a bathroom had no more of an idea of what was going on than the people watching the film. As the film went on, there was a little more information leaked, a little more progression with each minute that ticked by. And the fact that there were only two people instead of eight made it easier to know the characters, know why they were doing what they were doing, etc. Instead, "Saw II" is just basically a glorified theatrical version of "Survivor" with blood, guts, and gore.<br /><br />The first film also didn't reveal much of the surrounding environments outside of the bathroom. That's what made it scary; you didn't know who or what was watching them, why they were in there, or even if there was any hope that they would get out. In Saw II, a police team actually captures jigsaw (Tobin Bell), and throughout the film, there are cuts to detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), who must investigate the crime scene in order to save his own son, who happens to be trapped with the several others at the unknown location, about to be killed by the deathly gas.  Everything is just so silly when compared to the first film. It's like Leigh Whannel completely let his film go the way of "quick cash-in", and if he had a little more input on this film, I think it could have been much better.  Saw II does do some things right, such as the way people die and nailing the violence factor right on the head. There is plenty of gore in this film, and some of the twisted things the people have to do are pretty insane (seeing a girl crawl around in a pool of syringes is terrifying). But, the violence isn't handled well. Violence isn't something that is supposed to be there just to be there. It should have a purpose (such as scaring audiences!).  What director Darren Lynn Bousman and screenwriter Leigh Whannell (who wrote the first "Saw") attempt to do is create a scenario similar to the excellent "The Cube" and create a villain as menacing as Jon Doe in "Seven"; however, they fail to do either and "Saw II", despite its redeeming qualities, becomes an overly grisly, horrifically gory tale that isn't all that surprising or entertaining.</p></body></html>

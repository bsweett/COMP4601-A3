<meta name="summary" content="BRILLIANT---but you do have to THINK about the ending..."></head><body><p>I'll not bore you with a plot synopsis, which about half of all the reviews here have already provided.<br /><br />Nor will I go on at length about how masterful the script, actors, cinematography, and directors are---you probably already know that anyone who likes quality films (i.e. NOT the usual, execrable Hollywood big-budget, cliche-ridden, mainstream blockbusters, but REAL films that were *not* solely made by and for idiots and focus groups) raves about this movie's technical and artistic excellence.<br /><br />No, it's the ending of this movie, which is completely abrupt, inexplicable, and deeply unsatisfying in the conventional sense of what we usually expect from an ending: some kind of closure and resolution, some kind of "message" or "point," the good guys win or lose, the bad guys get caught or escape, the boy gets the girl or doesn't, tragedy or providence step in, etc.<br /><br />This movie ends with NONE of those things.  It doesn't seem to have any sense or meaning, rhyme or reason.  It's as if the rug was suddenly pulled from underneath us during the blink of an eye, and we have no idea who did it, when, or why.  It just happens.<br /><br />Well, this is one of the best reasons to buy this film on DVD: if you are totally confounded and befuddled by the way it ends, in the Special Features there is one segment where the directors and several of the cast talk about the film...they pretty much tell you what it's about, which is mainly through the title, the setting (the nakedly pitiless, harsh West Texas desert), and especially the stunningly diabolical character that Javier Bardem plays (for which he won a richly deserved Oscar).  It's kind of a nice Cliff-Notes feature, really.  And believe me, it makes all the sense in the world.<br /><br />In a nutshell, to truly "get" this film and its seemingly enigmatic ending, you have to understand one simple nugget: Sometimes making NO sense at all, actually makes the MOST sense of all.</p></body></html>

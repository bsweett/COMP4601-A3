<meta name="summary" content="Many good things to say about the movie.  Well done."></head><body><p>Children of Men is a science fiction story that could appeal easily to non-sci-fi fans. The movie is set in the year 2027 and portrays a very believable future. The twist is that by 2027, all humans have become infertile. The youngest person on Earth is 18 years old and when people stopped having babies, the world fell apart. Clive Owen delivers an incredibly realistic performance in bringing to life this book by British mystery maven, P.D. James. Owen stars as Theo Faron, the one-time activist who has lost his cause and seemingly his passion for life as well. An important part of his past catches up with him when he is confronted by an extremist organization asking for help. Does he help this woman find help, when it means risking her life and his? And does his decision become easier or harder when he learns she is pregnant!?<br /><br />The movie has it all: action, humor, and a brilliant theme showcasing the relationship between faith and chance in our lives. The action was gripping and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. In Children of Men, they do not hold your hand through the story; things happen and they happen quickly. You will not get lost due to the speed, but be prepared. Things happen and you may not agree with them all, but by the end of the movie I hope you agree with me that everything that happened was necessary and well-timed.<br /><br />The laughs come at odd intervals, but seem to be just when you need them. The performances by Michael Caine (Jasper) and Peter Mullan (Syd) added the right about of levity to balance out the serious nature of the story. I could talk all day about Michael Caine alone and his iconic career in film, but I will leave it at this: he was fantastic yet again. Any elaboration I make on that would mean divulging a detail of the film that you should experience for yourself.<br /><br />Jasper even brings the theme (mentioned above) right to the audience. He tells a story about Theo's past and sets it up nicely. I love movies that can pull that off; I can't imagine it is easy.<br /><br />I have never been in a war zone. I can only imagine what it would be like to be in such a hostile environment. From what I would imagine, Children of Men nailed it. I have seen movies with similar scenes, but they have never felt as real. Maybe it is the political environment currently that added to the feeling in the movie.<br /><br />I liked Children of Men for many reasons. I will admit that there were a few moments that I felt the time passed too slowly, but they were brief. Clive Owen did wonderfully. The language was rough and there is a lot of blood shed. If those do not deter you from seeing other movies, you should see Children of Men.<br /><br />For another Clive Owen movie you should see, check out Croupier.</p></body></html>

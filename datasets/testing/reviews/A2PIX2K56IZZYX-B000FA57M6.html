Awesome special effects, kick-ass guns, non-stop action, lots and lots of blood and gore, intense monsters and zombies, what more could you ask for? Good acting and a plot you say? Nope, not here, and you know what, who cares!! If anybody went into this expecting good acting and a plot I'm thinkin' they never played the game. The game has always been in-your-face, raw power, great visuals and lots of violence, and you want this in the movie version, and boy do you get it, and then some. Quick question, how many GOOD movies have we had that were derived from video games? Hmmmm, let's list shall we?<br /><br />1.Streetfighter, terrible 2.Super Mario Brothers, even more terrible 3.Alone In The Dark, just plain bad 4.House Of The Dead,  one of the worst movies ever made, oh, by the way, a sequel is in the works, god help us 5.Resident Evil 1 and 2, well, I liked these alot, but there were alot of negatives said about it. I'm sure I missed some, plus we have more on the way, Spyhunter, Bloodrayne (The same director from House Of The Dead and Alone In  The Dark) So, as you can see, the market is getting flooded, so it was real nice to see such a good video game movie such as this.<br /><br />The Rock and Karl Urban lead a group of bad-ass marines in a search and rescue/destroy mission on Mars. Problem is, there is no one to rescue, they have either been killed or mutated into a zombie/monster. Seems the research/archeologists found a 24th chromosone that can either make you super-human, or, well, you know by now I'm sure. But it effects each individual differently,  if you have evil tendencies you will turn, if you are generally good, then no change.<br /><br />The weaponry is so awesome, the guns these marines use are loud and quick, and pack a hell of a punch. Then there is the 'BFG' that The Rock gets to play with later on in the film, I'll give you 1 guess what it stands for...(Bio-Force Gun? nah.......) I'm guessing the monsters were CG, but I'll tell you what, it is some really good CG, They are all really scary looking and mean and nasty. Also the make-up on all the zombies and the blood and gore are all incredible looking, they really did there research into making the monsters/zombies look like something right out of the game. There is a scene toward the end where they switch to a 1st person shooter mode and it is so friggin' cool!! All you see is the end of the gun blowing anything and everything away, looking so much like the game but only better.<br /><br />Now I know acting and plot are important to any movie, and I would usually agree with you, no movie should get 4 stars if the acting sucks and you can't get into the plot. The acting doesn't suck, it's just that it's, well, not there. It's just your usual assortment of testerone-filled men yelling and cursing, you have seen it a hundred times before. This is The Rock's worst performance yet, but he has such a strong presence, and as my wife would say, when your that smokin' hot, who the hell cares?<br /><br />I did like Karl Urban, he of Lord Of The Rings fame, he plays Reaper, at first a total a-hole, but then mellows and kicks alot of butt toward the end. The other marines are all forgettable as are all the doctors and scientists, but it was sure fun watching then all die, some much worst then others.<br /><br />My wife usually does not like these mindless, pointless movies, but she said she had alot of fun (I'm sure The Rock had a little to do with that) and would recommend this to the ladies at work, so I think most women will enjoy it as much as the men. Be warned, it is extremely graphic and violent, just like the game was. There is also alot of language and some generally creepy, suspensefull scenes, I'd say late teens should be fine. You gotta check this out people, big fun to be had by all..........<br /><br />acting.....2 stars, Moving on.......<br /><br />directing....4 stars, Worthy adaptation of the game, well done<br /><br />special effects....4.5 stars, Incredible Monters, zombies, guns, Mars setting, The Arc,<br /><br />action rating.....4 stars, Non-stop from beginning to end, but there is also some horror and suspense to be found as well<br /><br />quality.....4 stars, A bit too dark at times, but otherwise amazing looking, be sure and watch the 1st person scene twice, trust me, it's worth it!!</p></body></html>

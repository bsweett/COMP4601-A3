Though in truth the ending.....<br />Anyway we start at a Star bucks coffee shop where we the viewers are introduced to a man in his 30's who is meeting a girl for the first time who is 14???  Anyway they chat for 20min getting to further know each other(they have only chatted on-line you see) and the young girl is very aggressive and would REALLY like to see the man's home.  Once inside we see that our male character is a photographer who takes pictures of only women DA-DA-DUN! He makes himself and his guest a drink where upon she smartly declines  And pours it out.  She however makes a drink for him and while he drinks she suggests he takes pictures of her DA-DA-DUN!  While he takes photographs  he starts to black out and eventually faints. Many hours he wakes up to find himself tied and taped to a chair.  He thinks its a game but THE GAME IS OVER!!!  The 14 yr.old girl is looking to find out what kind of guy she has before her and what kind of sicko gets off on 14 yr olds.  She looks desperately through out the house to find evidence and all the while cutting him and slapping him till he tells her.  a hour goes by as she trashes the house with no luck!  She looks and looks when finally she sees again the table with many little rocks on top.  She moves all the rocks and their is a safe!?!  We discover she does have a pedophile on her hands and also something more.  She begins surgery(her father is a doctor you see)and is going to castrate the male so she can pure him of his lust.  This however turns into a cat and mouse game which for me was kind of a let down.  I'd prefer it to stay with the HORROR aspects and leave the crime/drama out the window.  Still this is a good movie with great performances from its two stars and for those who like a twist at the end...This has it.  Do see it and if you are a guy...Hold them...Hold them TIGHT!!!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

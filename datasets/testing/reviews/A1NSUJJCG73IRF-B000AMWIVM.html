<meta name="summary" content="Saw  (2004)"></head><body><p>Director:  James Wan<br /><br />Cast:  Cary Elwes, Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, Ken Leung,  Dina Meyer, Makenzie Vega, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson.<br /><br />Running Time:  100 minutes.<br /><br />Rated R for violence, lots of gore, and language.<br /><br />"Saw" is obviously a direct pseudo-"Seven", attempting to create a new kind of psychopathic serial killer and for the most part it succeeds-but eventually falls apart slightly at the seams.  The overall premise is very clever:  A young man (played by Whannell, who also wrote the film) and an established physician (a much heavier, less charismatic Cary Elwes than in previous works) wake up in a disgusting, polluted bathroom and have no recollection of how and why they wound up there.  They are chained to the walls and accompanied by only one guest-a dead man with his head blown off.  As the doctor and his youthful companion piece the puzzle together, they realize that they are being tormented by the infamous "Jigsaw" killer, a maniac who juxtaposes his victims within scenarios in which they have to choice between their own lives or the deaths of others.  The identity of the killer is unknown, but as the truth from both of the captured men seeps through, the film picks up momentum and unfolds to a rather incomplete, far-from-stanch climax.<br /><br />Danny Glover stars as the aging detective who was originally assigned to the "Jigsaw" case, but was unable to completely close the case.  Due to an increasingly devote fascination with the killer, the detective attempts to stop the evil murderer once and for all.  "Saw" does possess some pizzazz and intelligence, using Elwes and Co. as players in a strange and macabre game of chess; however, the film is too disjointed and acted with such mediocrity that it cannot be taken too seriously.  The novice director Wan uses some excellent, hip cinematography to liven up the film and create some tense atmosphere, but "Saw" is never incredibly scary, but does keep you guessing until the very last frame.  Disappointing performances from Elwes and Glover.  A nice attempt for modern horror film standards, but films such as "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs" did it much, much better.</p></body></html>

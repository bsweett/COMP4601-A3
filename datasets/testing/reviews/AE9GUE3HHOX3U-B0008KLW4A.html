Considering it won the worst film of the year award from various sources, one can only expect "the worst".  The only thing that saves "Catwoman" from being a total loss is the "camp" value and the "so bad it's good" quality that made many a film famous including "Showgirls".  Halle Barry has never been an A List actress so you can't really expect much from her, but she does know how to gage her characters to a degree where it's effective but not spectacular.  Sharon Stone enters to add a strange chemistry with Miss Halle and oh NO!, that is when the movie gets really funky and oh so.... CAMPY!! (the word d'jour).  A most meomrable line from the movie that gives this film it's campy kick goes something like "It's OVER. No......It's over......TIME!!!!!!!. Yeah, you tell em girrl!  Hey, it's better than Avant garde BS like "Elecktra".</p></body></html>

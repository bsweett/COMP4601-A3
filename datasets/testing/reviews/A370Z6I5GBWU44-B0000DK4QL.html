<meta name="summary" content="Decent movie"></head><body><p>I am familiar with the basic story of the Daredevil comic books, so I think the movie does a decent job of adapting from the book. Sure, some people don't like this, and I don't claim it's a GREAT movie, but I honestly didn't think it was bad at all, and feel confident giving it a 4-star rating.</p></body></html>

She loves spooky flicks like this and developed goose flesh right away, almost in the first scene. I knew she was hooked by the supernatural elements of the movie. I wasn't as enthralled but stuck it out and had a pleasant surprise at the end.<br /><br />Briefly stated, "Skeleton Key" unlocks a lot of mystery and horror for the main players in this supernatural drama -- Goldie Hawn's daughter Kate Hudson, who plays a live in nurse; Gena Rowlands, who plays wife and matriarch to the patient, played by John Hurt; and Peter Sarsgaard who is their lawyer.<br /><br />Right after arriving, Hudson finds something is wrong in her new place of employment, an old Spanish moss laced mansion outside New Orleans. As the plot develops you learn the parties in the movie either practice or believe in something called hoodoo, a variant on voodoo. This is the source of the supernatural drama.<br /><br />Seems the (African American) caretakers in the house practiced hoodoo 90 years earlier with the children of the then homeowners. When the rich white parents and party guests found out, they lynched the caretakers. Or so it seemed, anyway.<br /><br />You dont find out what actually happened until the final apocalyptic scene in the film, where a truly unpredictable and exciting transformation takes place. You will clearly understand what's happened but you may not put it together with the caretakers from 90 years earlier.<br /><br />So, when you rent, buy or borrow this supernatural thriller, keep in mind at the end what happened 90 years earlier. By doing so, you'll be able to knock over all the dominoes in this involving, exciting and entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

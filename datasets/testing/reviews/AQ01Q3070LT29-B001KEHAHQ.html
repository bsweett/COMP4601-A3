<meta name="summary" content="Steve Martin tried but movie is a bomb."></head><body><p>DVD shown in Widescreen.  Warning: This is not a Blake Edwards movie.<br />The first  "THE PINK PANTHER" (1964) film starred Peter Sellers as "Inspector Jacques Clouseau".  This spy-comedy was a major success and it begun a series of Pink Panther cartoons theatrically and as a tv-series. People had already seen the James Bond 007 films, Dr No (1962) and From Russia With Love (1963).<br />  The second "Pink Panther" film, A SHOT IN THE DARK (1964), introduced Herbert Lom as "Dreyfuss", Bert Kwouk as "Kato", Peter Sellers, of course, returned as the bumbling Inspector, a role he would continue to play in 3 more films, THE RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER (1975), THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN (1976), REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER (1978).  Peter Sellers died in 1980.<br />  They had an idea. With the use of unseen footage of Sellers and bringing back other characters in new footage, they were able to make Trail of the Pink Panther (1982).<br />  At the same time, they were also filming "CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER" (1983) with Ted Wass (ABC's SOAP) as the Inspector.<br />  10 years later, they tried Roberto Benigni as "SON OF THE PINK PANTHER" (1993).<br />  13 years later, in an attempt to bring back The Pink Panther, Steve Martin was chosen as the new "Inspector Clouseau" after much voice training on Martin's part. However the number 13 would be unlucky for the film.<br />  No one from the original films made an appearance.<br />  Steve Martin tries in this one with Jean Reno as his partner, "Pon Ton". Kevin Kline as "Dreyfuss".  Kristin Chenoweth has three small scenes.  They should have made her part of the lead instead. She would make a great second banana to Steve Martin.  Steve Martin and Jean Reno look great as partners.<br /> Special Features: Audio Commentary by Director Shawn Levy, Alternate Opening title sequence CG version, Extended and deleted Scenes, featurettes, behind-the-scenes sleuth-cams.<br />A music video and a performance of Beyonce.<br />A clip of Sweet & Low "Think Pink".<br />  Option of English or French. Audio Set-up. Option of subtitles in English or French.<br /><br />Bottom Line: You cannot make a successful "Pink Panther" film without the writing and directing of Mr. Blake Edwards.<br /><br />***Pink Panther 2 was released February 13, 2009 with Steve Martin returning. John Cleese as "Dreyfuss".</p></body></html>

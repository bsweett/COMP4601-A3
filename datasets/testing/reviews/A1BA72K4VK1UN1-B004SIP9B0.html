In fact, this is the most redeeming facet of the movie.<br /><br />The story is this: Here, we have an intimate glimpse of Queen Elizabeth II (as well as her husband, the Queen Mother, and Prince Charles) during the window of time just before and during the week or so period of time after Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The focal point of the movie is the hostile reaction of the British people toward the Queen's cold attitude in regard to Diana's death.<br /><br />I need to say up front that I'm a fan neither of The Royals nor of the late Princess -- but I AM interested in hearing all about their endless peccadilloes. In fact, this actuality was one of my disappointments because I thought that this film was about the Queen's entire reign, and it's not. Still, I can't rightfully criticise what the film is NOT about... I just wish that the title had been more explicit.<br /><br />In any case, right away the Queen and the Windsor-Mountbatten family are portrayed as pretty heartless and rotten, at least by American standards. Following the death of Diana, Prince Charles is also served up to us as a spineless flip-flopper and a witless wimp... okay so far.<br /><br />At that point, newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair begins advising and urging the Queen to relent on her silence and isolation and share in the grief of the British people over Diane's death, a pill that the old sourpuss finds almost impossible to swallow. Still okay so far.<br /><br />Then, at a turning point in the movie, the producers elect to REDEEM the Queen, just because she came out and sniffed the flowers under extreme political pressure and duress. There was not the first bit of actual remorse in that woman's heart (neither in the film nor in reality!) So, WHY did the film-makers decide to attempt to make her look like a normal human being? I surely have not figured it out!<br /><br />So, in summary, I found this movie to be manipulative, although I must assert that this device was completely lost on me. I hold the Queen in no higher esteem now (post-film) than I did when she was acting like a witch the day after Diana died, (or even before that.)<br /><br />As far as the cinematography and the continuity of the film, it was superb. The Producers also shrewdly used some actual footage of Diana and others which was sprinkled throughout the movie. There's a lot of nice scenery in this flick and some really terrific acting. Overall, I was okay on watching this film all the way through but I would not watch it again. With some trepidation, I would slightly recommend it to others.</p></body></html>

I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks.  He's impressed me a few times before but honestly I can't think of a time when he's ever `wowed' me.  I am not a fan of Stephen King in that I never really have given him a try.  Aside from `Misery' I have never read any of his novels.  I have seen a few of the film adaptations and enjoyed them but I have also seen some of his adaptations and thought they were dreadful so really it's a mixed bag for me.  I decided to give this a chance only because a friend of mine raved it, and it has received high amounts of praise from the critics and have I mentioned yet that it was nominated for Best Picture of the Year at the Academy Awards so with that in mind I decided to sit down and watch this, finally.<br /><br />The film follows the effect one falsely accused man has on the prison guards in charge over him.  This man is John Coffey, an extremely large black man accused of raping and murdering two young girls.  Despite his immense size Coffey appears to be a very kind soul.  This is noticed by one of the guards, Paul Edgecomb.  Getting to know John, Paul realizes that he is, without a doubt, innocent but the evidence against him is surmountable and it appears that his execution is eminent.<br /><br />While this is the main storyline for `The Green Mile' there is so much more to uncover, and there should be since the film is three hours long.  I've read a while back that the character of John Coffey was modeled after Jesus Christ and this makes perfect sense when you watch this film and analyze it.  John's `powers' are very similar to the ones heaped upon Jesus and John's predicament is also one similar to that of Christ.  Everyone has turned on John except for a few men who put faith in his power to heal.  He is wrongfully accused of a crime he did not commit and sentenced to death by the men he was trying to protect.  It's something I did not expect to come from Stephen King, that's for sure, but then again I've never given him a fair chance...maybe I should.<br /><br />The performances in this film also elevate the material, especially that of Michael Clarke Duncan who delivers a performance so solid and so tempered that without it the film would have failed.  He is, with all due respect, the heart and soul of this film.  Tom Hanks surprised me by delivering an outstandingly tender performance.  It may actually be his best performance to date.  Patricia Clarkson sizzles in what little screen time she has as does Bonnie Hunt and David Morse and Barry Pepper do their best to stand out amidst powerful performances by James Cromwell and more notably Doug Hutchison who plays the `evil' Percy Wetmore.  Sam Rockwell is as disturbing as they come and the revelation of his character will chill you.<br /><br />Like I said in my title for this review, it is far better than I assumed it would be but it still was not as grand as some have suggested.  There are moments where the melodramatic feel doesn't quite mesh right and there are some scenes that tend to drag a bit.  I'm not saying that the length is a problem for it enables the audience to truly sink into the mood of the film but there are some scenes that could have been trimmed.  It is not one of my top five films of 1999, nor one of my top ten, but it rests well with my honorable mentions.  It is not as disturbing as `Carrie' and not as meaningful as `The Shawshank Redemption' but it rest nicely in the middle and delivers solid and gratifying entertainment.</p></body></html>

It doesn't pull any punches, doesn't sell itself out or wind up in a Hollywood fantasy ending. It is stark, violent, desperate and a bit nostalgic. An old time county sheriff(Tommy Lee Jones, brilliant in a laconic way) yearns for the days when the bad guys could be contained and caught without alot of violence. He could always solve a case without every using a gun but these days there is no limit to the violence(embodied by Javier Bardem's brilliant portrayal). Josh Brolin's character is out hunting and comes across a drug deal gone bad with bodies littered across the stark desert. A lone man is alive and begs him for water but he doesn't have any and takes off after finding a bag of money. But his conscience tears at him and he does the unthinkable even though he knows it is a stupid thing to do. He goes back to the scene of the crime to bring water to the man who by now is dead and he is seen by the drug bosses and the chase begins. My wife never really liked the movie, too violent and too abrupt of an ending. But like I said having read the book I think the film is brilliant and the best adaption of a Cormac McCarthy book I've seen. Any adaption of a McCarthy novel is close to impossible but the Coen Brothers have done it!</p></body></html>

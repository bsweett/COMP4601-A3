<meta name="summary" content="Four and 1/2 stars for one emotionally charged action thriller..."></head><body><p>Four Brothers is the story of heartbreak, emotion, and revenge driven characters and it is very good at emotional scenes and also action shots. This is one of the rare movies in which you actually believe in what the main characters are fighting for and how the death of one human being can effect so many people and cause so much grief...<br /><br />After the death of Evelyn Mercer in a store robbery, her four adopted sons: Bobby [Mark Wahlberg], Angel [Tyrese Gibson], Jeremiah [Andre Benjamin], and Jack "CrackerJack" [Garret Hedlund], return to the town that the grew up in for her funeral.<br /><br />The thing that links the audience to the characters is that all four of them aren't even related, but were all adopted by the kind woman who knew that they didn't even have a secure future in their lives. Angel and Jeremiah are black, and Bobby and Jack are white. However the four brothers still love each other and consider themselves family, no matter how many people look at them strangely as they call themselves brothers.<br /><br />The plot of the movie takes a dark turn as the four brothers start to learn that the random murder of Evelyn may not have been random at all. What results from that startling revelation is that Bobby, Angel, and Jack disobey police orders to not get involved in the case and go on a driven quest to find out who killed their beloved mother and why.<br /><br />The movie is filled with violence, and strong language. Some scenes involve drive by shootings, a wild car chase between the brothers and the two men who killed their mom, and a fist fight at the end between one of the brothers [I won't spoil who it is] and the sole man responsible for the death.<br /><br />Crooked cops, corrupt politicains, gang members, and organized crime all take shots at the four men and some scenes seem to have a million bullets flying everywhere. But there are moments of intense excitement and none of the action scenes seem to be overdone on violent killings. This is one movie that actually puts in the right amount of violence, mixed with the perfect amount of character buildup and even some bonding between the brothers that even they didn't know they could have.<br /><br />Extras of the Disks:<br /><br />Commentary by director John Singleton<br /><br />Behind the Brotherhood [A look at the different characters]<br /><br />Some deleted scenes<br /><br />English and Spanish subtitles<br /><br />and a showing of the making of the movie<br /><br />plus more....<br /><br />Highly recommended, this is one movie you need to see at least once......</p></body></html>

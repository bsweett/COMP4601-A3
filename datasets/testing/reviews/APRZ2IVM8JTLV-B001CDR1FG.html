A Universal Picture!!<br /><br /> Starring Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte, Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno and Sam Elliott.<br /><br /> Through an incredibly complex and lengthy series of events spanning decades, genetic biologist Bruce Banner begins turning into a large green monster at inopportune moments which soon involves his mad scientist mass murdering father, the US Govt., the military and a "evil" corporation which secretly controls the country. Soon much Freudianism, proterrorist and anti-American propaganda, the occasional CGI sequence and a certain degree of smashing ensue.<br /><br /> This is a film that, though very well, if rather desperately and frantically so, directed with several very pleasing moments of excellent comic book style action--particularly during the picture's fourth 30 minute act never truly succeeds due to several serious conceptual flaws and primarily because its director Lee was a bad choice from the outset. It seems fairly clear that Lee was using the film has a trial run for his later grab at Oscar and Politically Correct Hollywood acceptance BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The basic concept of both films is that things were great and nifty in the 60s under a Democratic President where evil mad scientist terrorists are easily contained through legal means and sheepherders can rump roast each other with carefree abandon but once a Republican gets in office--in the later film Reagan in this film Bush--things just go to hell. Gays get murdered by evil Americans. Terrorist mad scientists, who now resemble Osama Bin Laden, are released. The Govt. is controlled by evil corporations. Persons are detained indefinitely and can be made to disappear and prisoners are tortured. Both Bush and Condelliza Rice appear as characters apparently complicit in the liberal paranoia. There is a Haliburton style corporation. And the main corporate villain left the military to make money in business--which might sound familiar to Julius Streicher readers--and has a suspiciously large nose. How Lee restrained himself from having said character wear a yarmulke one cannot imagine. Those darn "neocons" are everywhere!! Oh and innocent people turn into large green monsters.<br /><br /> On the face of it, one is surprised that the film was not forced into being a major critical success ala BBM until one realizes that Lee made three fundamental errors. In spite of an unrelenting strictly by the Party line talking point attack on the Bush administration, Lee 1) presents the US military is a fairly positive light valiantly striving to protect the American citizen from death and destruction as well as being reasonably efficient and effective--which, of course, is anathema to the groups Lee was trying to court and 2) placing an a verbal attack on same and the country that could have been delivered with little alteration by anyone from Cindy Sheehan to Ted Kennedy in the mouth of the film's villain--thus rendering it ineffective from a propaganda point of view and finally 3) putting all of the above in a film about a large green monster---which is not really the type of vehicle such forces like to work in. Gay sheepherders are far more appealing to the pseudo sophisticates.<br /><br /> Plus the film just simply has far too much baggage designed to make it acceptable to the parlor pinks. There is all this rubbish going on about the relationship between Banner and his father, Betty Ross and her father General Ross, Bruce and Betty, suppressed emotions and memories and some new age gobbledeegook about reaching one's inner potential. There is nearly an hour of rushed jumping through the hoops exposition before the Hulk (only called by that name once in the film and almost as an afterthought) finally makes his first appearance. The film tends to be a talk fest with the occasional token Hulk appearances to justify the title and presumably keep the great unwashed in their seats for the primary indoctrination sessions. The film runs nearly two hours and thirty minutes when easily an hour could have been snipped.<br /><br /> To be sure, the film does have elements from the book so presumably someone had some familiarity with the character. The aforementioned long fight between the Hulk and the military is spectacular and worth the effort of viewing the film. The sequence set in 1966 is, though a perversion, is from the last page of the original HULK story. Though here instead of a repentant communist destroying a Soviet base with a nuclear explosion, it is an irate American destroying an American one. The Nick Nolte character eventually turns into a, if a rather snobby, version of The Absorbing Man. And the film does use the correct names.<br /><br /> But they are the names only. Bruce Banner--played by the incredibly dull Bana--Betty Ross--played well by Connelly though as the de riquer STRONG INDEPENDENT PERFECT FEMALE--and Glenn Talbot are unrecognizable and might as well be called Bob, Mary and Ted. Nick Nolte's mad scientist character is incoherent. One rarely understands either his motivations or, frequently, just what the heck he is saying. The film also favors and takes elements and lines from the failed HULK TV program of the 70s. So one has a failure imitating a failure. Sam Elliott, though perhaps a tad too calm as General Ross--gives the best performance leading a gravitas to the proceedings whenever he is on screen. The film never has the Hulk speak thus depriving the viewer of the character's great iconic dialogue. The Hulk is also far too large in the film being somewhere around 30 feet tall when the character was usually around 8 to 10 feet in the book. Thus the film comes across as being the first American Japanese giant monster film rather than about the Hulk. There is also the very silly idea that the Hulk, instead of getting stronger as his anger increases, expanding in size like a large green balloon in one case breaking an opponent's jaw by suddenly expanding his shoulder size like sometype of inflatable shoulder pad. Oh and is it really necessary to point out that anyone who detonates a nuclear device on US soil killing Lord knows how many people is NEVER going to be released from jail..even with a Republican in office!!!<br /><br /> This is a film as a primary example of the dangers of letting a so called genius near anything even remotely entertaining. One wishes a "mere" hack had been given the film instead so Lee could go somewhere else to suck up to the Gay Agenda crowd and get his Oscar. The sequel was a far superior effort because it remembered something that Lee forgot a superhero film should be.<br /><br /> Fun.<br /><br /> Truly complexity is the first refuge of scoundrels.<br /><br /> And it could have been all so easy.<br /><br /> Bruce Banner exposed to a Gamma Bomb explosion.<br /><br /> Whenever he is angry or afraid turns into the Incredible Hulk.<br /><br /> And then Hulk smashes.<br /><br /> Hulk is the strongest one there is.<br /><br /> Hulk likes beans.<br /><br /> Very simple.<br /><br /> Instead all we get are the beans.<br /><br /> See it when one has some time to kill.</p></body></html>

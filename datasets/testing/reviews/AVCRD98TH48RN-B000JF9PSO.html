It is a masterful, technical achievement that is impressive througout under the supremely talented eye of director Paul Greengrass.  His Oscar-nomination for his work here is more than justly deserved. I sincerely hope he wins.  The characters are all humanistic and easy to care about.  Even the terrorists, who embark on a crime against humanity, come across as real people who sincerely believe in what they are doing.  Creepy.  There is the underlying tension at the beginning as passengers and crew board the doomed flight, and one cannot help but hope the plane never takes off at all, that some technical problem will keep the plane grounded and safe; the people aboard returned to their families.  The idea of using hand-held cameras throughout the movie intitially turned me off from seeing this film.  Normally, under most circumstances, I despise hand-held camera-work as it comes across as amateurish and annoying.  But in this film the increasing tension aboard the plane makes use of hand-held cameras more kinetic.  Using absolutely no "name actors" in the movie also adds to the effect of feeling like one of the passengers.  The acting from the entire cast is superb.  Watching this film made me feel as though I were re-living 9/11 all over again.  This film is terrifying, exhilirating to the point you want to scream, and outstanding filmmaking in every way.  This is a special film.</p></body></html>

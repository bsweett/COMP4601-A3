<meta name="summary" content="Michael Clayton the earnest problem solver"></head><body><p>"Michael Clayton" is a drama film with a narrative that centers on Clayton (George Clooney) who is an attorney and he is the firm's fixer.<br /><br />The storyline contains several layers as Clayton has numerous work and personal worries. He has been part of a failed business venture and must pay out a loan shark, which also involves his brother. On the work front he has to see to a respected work colleague who has a bizarre meltdown, and a major firm client (U-North) is taking extreme damage control measures to cover up their wrong doings, and Clayton unwittingly falls into their sights.<br /><br />The movie has a solid cast who all contribute to provide a compelling performance in what is an enthralling story of deceit, attempting to uncover the truth, and redemption.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

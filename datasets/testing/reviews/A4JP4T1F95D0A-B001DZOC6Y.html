<meta name="summary" content="It's Not That Bad"></head><body><p>I'm not sure why there are so many 1 star reviews.  Maybe people expect more from M. Night because of some of his other stand out films.  This film isn't that bad.  After the terrible Lady in the Water and The Village, I thought this one was decent.  Certainly not his best, but a fair story.  The acting is a little weak, which is surprising considering how talented the cast is.  I thought the whole thing was an interesting idea that doesn't quite succeed, but does work on some levels.  Maybe my expectations were low after hearing so many bad reviews, but I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.</p></body></html>

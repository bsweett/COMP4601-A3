Now, Chris Cooper is good in everything he does. Jamie Fox is so overrated it isn't even funny. Jennifer Garner is not pretty at all in anything and when she is in a movie where she wears no make up and only has her incredibly strange face and big fish lips to carry here she falls flat on her face. He acting skills sure aren't going to carry her anywhere. The Arrested Develpment guy, or whatever show he is on? Well, he was ok though his role was very cliche but I have one comment. How can  you get kidnapped and have your hands bound and have about 6 guys beat your face in unmercifully and when you get captured? You have a bloody lip? He must have the hardest head and the skin on his face must be like shoe leather.<br /><br />This movie wasn't bad and worth watching. See above for my rant but see the movie. It is not great but worth a peak. Oh... and Jeremy Piven? God that guy is annoying. He plays the same character in every movie he has ever been in and that character is... Jeremy Piven.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's Johnny Depp!"></head><body><p>I won't spoil this film for you by giving details of the script. Too much has already been revealed! What you need to know is that this is one of the best films I've seen in quite some time. The DVD is riveting, not because of King's story (which is wonderful), but because of Depp's ability to bring it to life.</p></body></html>

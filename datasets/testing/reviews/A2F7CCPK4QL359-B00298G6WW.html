<meta name="summary" content="Its the Flip side of James Bond"></head><body><p>Pierce Brosnan has previously  played Remmington Steele and James Bond. In this  film, he plays a hapless hit man who lost his nerve to kill. This black comedy takes a large poke at the Steele/Bond legends that Brosnan have already done and made famous. Brosnan does this satire  with a flair<br /><br />When he loses his nerve, he chats with a simple man in a bar (Greg Kinnear). Kinnear's character reminds me of Albert Brooks's character from the bad remake of the IN-Laws..that is where the similar ideas ends. He befriends Bronson in his hour of need<br /><br /> Kinnear's wife is played by Hope Davis. This role is most lifelike I have seen Davis act since she did the role of Joyce in the film American Spendor<br /><br />To give away the end would spoil the fun..just get it and enjoy it yourself<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

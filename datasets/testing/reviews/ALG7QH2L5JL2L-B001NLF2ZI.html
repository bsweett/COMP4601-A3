The Interpreter, thanks to Nicole Kidman, was not just thoughtful, but involving. As with anything having Sean Penn in it, it was somewhat top-heavy in the 'message' department, but Kidman's elfin grace saved the day. Her portrait of a 'white' woman-and fair-haired as well; which kind of drives home the point-whose 'home' is a country where white skin is a cause of social displacement, discrimination and alienation, was understated and therefore effective. By comparion, Penn was ponderous and colorless; which is possibly as it should have been. His character, despite a contrived background that served mainly as a tool for some contemplative philosophy of life and death, remained essentially shallow and undemanding.<br /><br />The pacing of the story was uneven, but in this instance that was an asset. There was too much heavy stuff in here, which required some down-time on the part of the audience. All in all, the dosage was well measured and applied judiciously.<br /><br />For those who wonder, after they saw the movie, just what exactly was the 'point', or what it was all 'about'-apart from it being a political polemic, which, of course and sadly, it was to a large extend...<br /><br />Well, it's all in the ending-which in this movie does wrap things up, showing up the dismal and near-uncrossable gulf that will always exist between people who have something to live for and those who basically don't.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP</p></body></html>

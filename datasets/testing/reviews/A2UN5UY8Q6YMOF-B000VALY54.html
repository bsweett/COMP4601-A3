Robert Downey JR plays a petty theif who goes to LA and gets thrust into acting.  A murder mystery develops, but it seems mostly just there to provide a vehicle for Downey Jr's jokes and stunts.  The movie had several parts that dragged along, but unfortunately it is already too short to cut more out.  The picture quality is OK, but I still hate combo discs-I want to see HD DVD with minimal compression!  Worth renting, but nothing more.</p></body></html>

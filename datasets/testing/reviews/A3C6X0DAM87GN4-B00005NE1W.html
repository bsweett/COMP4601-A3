<meta name="summary" content="Worst Movie Of The Year!!!!!"></head><body><p>This is truly the stupidest movie I've seen this year! People seem to be looking at this movie in the wrong context. Many people for some odd reason seem to think it's a drama, when infact it's a boring,dull,long,and unfunny,comedy-of-manners. When you get right down to it this movie is about Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to convince David Dunn (Bruce Willis) that he is a superhero! What sort of profound mind could dare come up with such an idea!? This movie is so stupd, i saw this movie with a bunch of people who had really no idea how to view this movie. Let me give everyone who hasn't seen this movie two prime examples of what exactly I'm talking about. There's a scene where Jackson first proposeses the idea to Willis that he is infact a modern day superhero. That right there, is worth a laugh, but wait, there more absurdity on the way. Jackson then starts rambling on about how comics are windows into the past, yet again, this is worth another laugh. The man is speaking so profoundly about comics. He's stating their importants in the world. Give me a break! This, to me, is a funny, ludicrous scene. And to top it all off, Jacksons, says his lines, with such honesty. I was actually waiting for him to start to laugh. And the audience i saw this with, seemed to be so taken away with this scene. They seem to have forgotten just how dumb this movie is. That, it is okay to laugh at it. Here's a man, telling another man, he's a superhero. You have to admit that's funny in thought. Just think if someone came up to you and told you that. Wouldn't you think that person needs help and laugh in their face? Of course you would! Another example is, Willis's son believes what Jackson has said to be true about his father, and to prove it to him, he wants to shoot him to show him he won't get hurt or die. After pleading with his mother and father not to shoot Willis, the little boy says &quot;Only once mommy!&quot; as if that will make everything ok. Let me shoot daddy once, it won't hurt lol. And yet again, people just looked on not laughing. My two friends and I couldn't stop laughing at such a remark. I noticed, soon after people heard us laugh, many people then started to laugh also. It was as if they needed to be told it's &quot;okay&quot; to laugh. There's nothing wrong with that. I was able to see this movie for what it is, something many,many people aren't doing. This is a ridiculous movie with an insane storyline. And that's what it's suppose to be. A comedy - of - manners I feel. The whole idea amny have to agree is funny. One man trying to convince another man he's a superhero. If Mel Brooks would of made this, people wouldn't be able to stop laughing. My pick for the worst film of the year! * 1\2 out of *****</p></body></html>

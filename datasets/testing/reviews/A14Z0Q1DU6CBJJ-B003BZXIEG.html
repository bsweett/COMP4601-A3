I think the X-men is the richest of all the comic book superhero collections, when it comes to stories, characters and possibilities. Spiderman's the coolest, but X-men has numerous characters that deal with real issues that coincide with issues of the world... like mutantism/racism, fear of the unknown and stereotyping.<br /><br />So, now we have X-men: THE LAST STAND. What? Last stand?<br /><br />The first two X-men movies were outstanding, yet only scratching the surface of the stories that are to be told in the comic book series and its possibilities. The third and supposedly, FINAL film, couldn't possibly do the series justice if it ended the series now. I mean, what about APOCALYPSE, JUGGERNAUT, BLACK TOM, ERIC THE RED, the FOUR HORSEMEN, GAUNTLET, the HELLFIRE CLUB, STRYFE and the Mutant Liberation Front and of course the Sentinels.<br /><br />So, what did the creators of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND do? I'm still not sure. They took, what was the PHOENIX SAGA, or when Jean Grey returns from the dead as an even more powerful Mutant than she was, struggling to control her powers. They took the Phoenix Saga, rewrote it, and hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Ultimately, we do get to see the Sentinels... for about 15 seconds. Their eyes shining through fog and one of their heads dropping to the ground... only to turn out being a simulator. Then we do get to meet JUGGERNAUT... again, seemingly just thrown in and not given any meaningful air time. We get to meet a bunch of random Mutants, seemingly created by the writers. None of which are of any note. Oh, and of course we get to see ANGEL in some brief scenes... dives out a window and flies away and then appears in the final scene briefly. Colossus, vaguely used. Again, all these cool characters... just basically given a reference and not explored.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot about the introduction of BEAST, played by Kelsey Grammar. He does a great job, but again, just a, "Here's Beast, shows over folks."<br /><br />So, why are they in such a hurry to END THE MOST SUCCESSFUL comic book TRILOGY of all time? They are so intent on ONLY HAVING 3 FILMS that they sped through years of X-MEN history and needless to say put together a hyperactive, crammed too tight, scatter-brained, sloppy and disappointing film.<br /><br />What WAS a story that EXCEEDED all boundaries and had no limits, earth, space & beyond, became a story that could be capped off with a not-so-huge battle on a small island... and done. A disappointing end to what could have been a much richer and much more entertaining series.</p></body></html>

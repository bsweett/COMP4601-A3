Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep lead a cast of highly talented actors. Because they are not 'just going through the motions' of an earlier script, viewers will leave with chills....and food for thought.<br /><br />The high adaptability of politics to constantly changing times also means the 'new' ending does not detract from the enduring film message (which itself has not changed): Candidates which apparently seem too good to actually be true are likely fronting for another organization.<br /><br />Better than Michael Moore's documentary, 'The Manchurian Candidate' makes an excellent argument for increased voter participation and independent candidate scrutiny.</p></body></html>

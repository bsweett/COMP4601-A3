<meta name="summary" content="Without Depp, This Movie Would Suck.  2.5 Stars"></head><body><p>There's no question that Johnny Depp is one of the greatest actors alive today, if not ever. He's that kind of actor that can make any movie worth watching. Such is the case with SECRET WINDOW, the latest adaptation of a Stephen King story (I really wish they would stop; only a handful of King movies were really good, anyway . . . . the rest were horrible). Johnny Depp's performance in this movie is absolute dynamite, and I think one of his best. It's even better than his fun-yet-vastly-overrated performance in PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN (I mean, he was good, but he got his first Oscar nod for THAT?!) Depp creates a character in SECRET WINDOW that is truly memorable and realistic, capturing both the sorrow and humorous quirks that a reclusive writer probably would have.<br /><br /> That said, aside from marvelling at Depp's seemingly endless acting abilities, there's not much to see here. The story is fairly interesting, and might even have been really good, if not for the ending. I mean, I saw this coming half-way through the movie, so I was hardly surprised at all. (Let's just say that anyone who has seen A BEAUTIFUL MIND will easily guess the ending.) I mean, at least they could have made it more scary! I slightly jumped twice, and that was it. Luckily, it's a short movie.<br /><br /> Well, in any case, fans of Johnny Depp are definitely going to want to see this flick. After all, thanks to him, the story actually holds your attention. Without him, however, I'd say that this is one of the most derivative excuses for a &quot;horror&quot; movie or &quot;thriller&quot; that I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

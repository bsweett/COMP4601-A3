<meta name="summary" content="this movie is so bad, so clueless and so......"></head><body><p>by following james ellroy's novel about this murder case in the 40s is from the very beginning doomed to be a failure. ellroy's novels usually are so pretentiously noir. this screenplay is totally fragmented with bad casting job, even most of the performers are either oscar winners or reputed actors. a clueless, vague, boring, going-nowhere, don't-know-what's-going-on screenplay. almost every scene and set in this movie were totally unnecessary and could be deleted and won't have hurt its going. the boxing bout scene, the lesbian night club scene, the family dining scene, the hotel scene, the sit out at his partner's home to take care of his wife scene, the gun fight scene linked to the field where the mutilated female was found scene, the visiting of his senile father's scene....every one of them could be and should be cut and deleted. and to think further, the whole movie could and should be deleted.<br />the movie itself, just like ellroy's novel, even it was deemed as the best of ellroy's, is so pretentiously noir, noir, overly noir, added some yellowish, brownish lens to imitate that era with chain-smoking people, hats...lousy background music that usually come with disney cartoons, ended this movie up in a messy shape.  not even you've read or re-read the novel first, you still didn't quite get it, no matter what and, couldn't have cared less.<br />do i wear a dark sun glasses and make me look pretty noir? of course not.</p></body></html>

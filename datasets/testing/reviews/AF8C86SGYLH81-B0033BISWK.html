It is one of the best Sci-Fi films I've ever seen...and it has "heart".  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it won the Oscar.  A must!  Intelligent, emotional, believable, and awesome directing, editing, sound and makeup.  It contains a hint of several sci-fi classics such as "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "E.T.", and "Batteries Not Included".  Unlike those, however, this one is much more graphic and may be too intense for the kids.  Peter Jackson's finest work.  GREAT JOB!  I want more!!!</p></body></html>

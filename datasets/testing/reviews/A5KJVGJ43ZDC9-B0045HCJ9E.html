<meta name="summary" content="Lame Hitchcock"></head><body><p>Every artist has a bomb in them. This is one of Hitchcock's.<br /><br /> No good purpose is served by pretending to like this movie-seems like the editors and a good chunk of reviewers put metaphorical horse blinders on while watching because an ostensibly "great" director is overseeing it. It's a dumb movie no matter who is at the helm. The comedy is sub-par, Cary Grant is given inane and foppish dialogue as he tries to woo Eva Marie Saint's character, and the intrigue is nonexistent; you can get much more adventure out of the worst of the James Bond films.<br /><br />We all look back fondly on the classics in any medium. That said, a critical eye should separate the wheat from the chaff. Finding this glass-jawed lightweight a great timepiece of the 50s memorable lacks discernment. I will give it one thing...the score is superb. It does alot of the work in terms of atmosphere that the visual part of the flick is unable to provide.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you're on a classic movie tear, save yourself a painful 2+ hours and don't bother with this malarkey. Liberate thyself from the tyranny of blind artist worship for the sake of banal vanity.</p></body></html>

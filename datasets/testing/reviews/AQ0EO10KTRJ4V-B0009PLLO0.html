<meta name="summary" content="This should kill "sword and sandle" trend for awhile"></head><body><p>Everytime an idea hits big, studios race to imitate that concept until they grind that trend into the ground...<br /><br />It seems in the past 2 years there have been a flurry of films trying to reproduce the feel and success of Braveheart and Gladiator.<br /><br />Each have failed and been worse than the one before it.<br /><br />We have had Troy, several other forgettable ones that escape me now and here we have Alexander.<br /><br />This film should ring the deathbell for "Sword and Sandle" movies for awhile.<br /><br />I won't repeat what others have said here, but all I can add is that after watching this for 3 hours with friends.... when it was over we all looked at each other and commented...........<br /><br />"That was painful to watch wasn't it".<br /><br />To which the reply was.... "Oh I thought I was the only one that felt that way, if I knew you guys had the same feeling I would have suggested ejecting the DVD 2 hours ago !"<br /><br />Definatley not a movie that draws you in.<br /><br />When you see a great well done movie, you can almost forget for awhile you are watching a movie with actors playing a part and feel what you are seeing is real............ but with Alexander you FEEL like you are watching Colin Farrell play the part of a historic figure and in fact the whole film feels strained and forced like it just never got itself together.<br /><br />It's obvious alot of work and effort went into this film and for this I feel sorry for alot of the folks in it, because for all that effort it still falls flat and will probably be remembered as a cinematic failure.<br /><br />Unless you are an absolute fan of the historical figure Alexander, steer clear of this film.<br /><br />In fact even if you are a big fan of Alexander the Great, you make wish to steer clear of this film as it tends to highlight his faults, failures and weakneses over his strengths and actually diminishes his historical significance to the point of making him appear irrelevent.<br /><br />Usually in a historical film like this you get MORE interested in the focal character and afterwards want to go out and buy a book or find more information about them........ with Alexander,during the last 45 minutes of the film my wife and I were whispering to each other....... "Die already"<br /><br />Afterwards our friends admitted they were thinking the same thing to themselves.<br /><br />One of my friends who is not very historically knowledgable asked me afterwards.... "Hey Mike, why is he called Alexander the Great anyway ? Unless they skipped over it in this film, he really didn't accomplish much afterall did he except run his people ragged on some warped vision he had ?"<br /><br />Not the effect I imagine the producers and director were going for.</p></body></html>

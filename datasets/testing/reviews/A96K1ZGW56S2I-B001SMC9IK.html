There are very little special effects in that film and emphasis was placed on the writing and character development.  Over fifty years when it first was released in theatres, the film still holds up and resonates with audiences.  It's a film that was done so well, that no remake should ever have been attempted, yet because it was so well done it was also inevitable that one would be made.<br /><br />In the new THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL Keanu Reeves portrays Klaatu, an alien who comes to Earth in a giant fluid-appearing orb that lands in New York City's Central Park.  Klaatu is an alien, but in order to interact on Earth, he takes the form of a human--a man who came in contact with an orb in the Artic wilderness nearly a century ago.  The government wants to know whatever it is that Klaatu knows and if it becomes clear that he is a threat, they want him eradicated.  Enter Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly).  Dr. Benson is part of a group of scientists who were put together when government officials thought Klaatu's "craft" was an asteroid on a collision course with New York and she was the first person to make "contact".  Klaatu has a mission and he gets Benson, and her adoptive son, Jacob (Jaden Smith), to help him all the while trying to convince him to save humanity instead of destroying it.<br /><br />Even though I didn't think the movie should have been remade, I was looking forward to seeing THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  I had some apprehension about the movie, but the previews were full of suspense and action and I thought that Reeves would be perfect as newer Klaatu.  I also enjoy watching most anything Jennifer Connelly performs in.  With Kathy Bates, John Cleese, Jaden Smith, and Kyle Chandler rounding out the supporting cast, the movie appeared to have a great group of high-caliber well-known actors who would make up for any weaknesses in the script.  And after the opening sequence, which was extremely well done, I thought my misgivings and apprehensions about the movie were misplaced.  But, they weren't.  After the opening sequence, everything went downhill.  The cast really did a great job of acting but their talents were hampered and thrown to waste in an ill-conceived script awash with terrible dialogue that is basically just a device for a special-effects showcase and propaganda pitching machine.  Not only that, but one of the most memorable characters from the original film, Gort, has been reduced to an acronym that, instead of having the power to save the world and resurrect life, only exists to destroy it.<br /><br />Too bad someone didn't tell the filmmakers to "klaatu barada nikto" before they started.</p></body></html>

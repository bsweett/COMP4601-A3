During the scenes of Kane destroying Susan's room, Orson Welles' hand was really bleeding as his threw himself into motivation. He continued his scenes like a pro.<br /><br />  Orson Welles wanted Lucille Ball for the lead, but RKO vetoed it.  Lucy repaid his kindness by having Orson appear on her hit CBS tv series, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EJWA">I Love Lucy - The Complete Sixth Season</a> in 1956.<br />  In 1958, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz would buy RKO and changed the title to Desilu.<br />  Orson Welles and Lucille Ball would meet again on Dean Martin's Celebrity Roast: Jimmy Stewart, televised in 1978.<br /><br />  You may have first heard of Orson Welles from his CBS Radio program, "The Mercury Theater on the Air" dramatization, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LZ5AIG">The War of the Worlds - Original Broadcast</a>, October 30, 1938.<br /><br />  People who listened to the above broadcast thought it was real and it caused a mass panic. People were calling the operators, the police, and emergency because they were upset. People called into CBS Radio not realizing it was only a radio dramatization, not an actual news report.

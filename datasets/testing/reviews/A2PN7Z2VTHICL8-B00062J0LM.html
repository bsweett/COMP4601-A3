<meta name="summary" content="Corporative America is a good America, right Mother?"></head><body><p>If you like movies about the big, bad corporate evil stalking innocent civilians and making unholy alliances to further their already outlandish power and profit, then you are going to love The Manchurian Candidate.<br /><br />Ben Marco (the excellent Denzel Washington) was a Captain in a Gulf War incident, where his squad was attacked by the enemy and suffered two casualties.  The movie begins with him speaking to a troop of scouts about his Sergeant, Raymond Shaw (played expertly by Liev Schreiber) and how Shaw won the Medal Of Honor for his bravery in saving the squad.  Just outside this small meeting, Marco runs into Al Melvin, a disorientated squad member with a bizarre notebook containing sketches of his dreams.<br /><br />Like a slow leak, Melvin's revelations incite the unraveling of Marco's mind also, who attempts to confront Shaw with his own dreams that mirror Melvin's.  But Raymond Shaw is running for Vice President, a position that his mother, Senator Ellie Shaw (brilliantly played by Meryl Streep) used her power to manipulate him into.  Shaw seems a little strange, a little bit robotic, and reluctant to speak with Marco.  He seems torn by a force that is hidden inside him.<br /><br />Under all the political treachery lurks an enormous Corporation, Manchurian Global, contributing to both sides of the political dance but in fact backing a candidate they can completely control.  Ellie is obviously a tool of this conglomerate, but believes with pompous narcissism that she is always the one in control.  Running against her son's ticket to the white house is Senator Thomas Jordan (superbly played by Jon Voight), a man with enough power and experience in politics to thwart Ellie's plans for her son.<br /><br />Time reveals secrets unraveled, brainwashing, mysterious co-incidences, and a nasty evil-doctor villain named Atticus Noyle.  Ben Marco is in a race for time against his own sanity, and the only one he can rely on is a new acquaintance named Rosie (played by talented Kimberly Elise, who also appeared in John Q. with Denzel).<br /><br />You really must see the film, because nothing is what it seems to be, and at the pace that both discoveries and sanity unravel, it is truly a nail-biting experience.  Some of the scenes are a little disjointed, which in my opinion, follows the slide through Marco's mind.  There is a very bizarre dream sequence, and a very disturbing "incest is best" scene between Ellie and her son Raymond.<br /><br />A little reminiscent of vast deregulation spree of the 1990's, The Manchurian Candidate takes corporate greed and takeover-hunger to new heights of insanely dubious behaviors, one that we hopefully won't see in our own non-fictional future.<br /><br />Far outshining any other aspects of this movie is the absolutely spectacular performance of Meryl Streep as Ellie Shaw.  I thought she had reached her pinnacle when she made me laugh so hard in `She Devil', stealing the show from every other actress in it, but I would resolutely state that this is her finest performance to date.  She comes across as hard yet feminine, determined and demented, powerful and righteous.<br /><br />Teamed up with such a successful actor as Denzel Washington, for me it was a no-miss simply from the performances of these two actors.  Liev Schreiber is fantastic in his portrayal of Raymond Shaw, reminiscent of a talented cross between Kevin Spacey and Kevin Pollak, very adept with facial expression and depicting emotion.  Jon Voight is phenomenal as Senator Thomas Jordan, and my hat is also off to character actors Miguel Ferrer and Bruno Ganz for their roles.<br /><br />If you like intrigue, brainwashing, evil corporations, and sinister doctors and dreams, then you should like The Manchurian Candidate.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

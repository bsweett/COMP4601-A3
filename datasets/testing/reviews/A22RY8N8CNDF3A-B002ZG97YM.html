It is based on the book by Cressida Cowell and the hero is shy "Hiccup"  (Full name is Hiccup Horrendus Haddock III).  He is the skinny 13 year old son of a big and mighty Viking leader.  As part of Viking culture he must kill a dragon to prove he has warrior qualities and will be able to succeed his hero father in the Viking kingdom.  After Hiccup downs a dragon beast, he finds he cannot kill it.  He names it toothless and they become buddies as they help each other out.  The story shows how the kingdom has dragons of every ilk and many of them to boot!  It keeps you interested as the tide of opinion turns and a fantastic ending.  The only criticism I have is that the Vikings seem to have a Scottish accent instead of Nordic, and Hiccup's is just as American as can be.  That does not take away from the movie but older viewers may notice.  A nice adventure for the kids.</p></body></html>

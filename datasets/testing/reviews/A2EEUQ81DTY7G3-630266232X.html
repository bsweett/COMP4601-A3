All the attributes are there - a mysterious murder, brooding romanticism, the obsession of a beautiful woman, and a love that reaches far beyond the dark shadow of death. Elegantly directed by Otto Preminger, Laura is all about the lengths one will go, to prove one's love. The story is about passion and infatuation and about two very different men who end up being obsessed with the same woman.<br /><br />The movie begins as the wealthy Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) sits in his bathtub writing Laura's biography in his swank Manhattan penthouse. It soon becomes obvious that he has been sexually obsessed with a woman who was just found murdered. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews), a working class detective assigned to the case, is questioning Waldo about his relationship with Laura.<br /><br />Mark is ruggedly handsome, muscular, and down-to-earth, the complete opposite to the snotty, effete Waldo. From the outset, the two take an instant dislike to one another.  Although Waldo did not have a sexual relationship with Laura, they were great friends, he admired her beauty and gave her first big break in the advertising world where she moved into a position of prominence through her own ability.<br /><br />Mark becomes captivated with the dead woman when he searches her apartment and sees a beautiful portrait of her, but he is frustrated that he doesn't have any leads to the case. Waldo tells Mark that he has been constantly obsessed with her and jealous of her other boyfriends in the 5-years that he knew her. He was particularly resentful of Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), whom he despises as being someone who is a weakling, a scoundrel and a scam artist.<br /><br />Laura's older aunt, Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson), is in love with Shelby and doesn't care if his character is rotten, even supporting the bankrupt society person from Kentucky with funds. Mark is convinced that Anne, Shelby, and Waldo, are hiding something and they all become his suspects in the murder. As the young detective keeps digging into Laura's life, a sudden revelation casts light on whether it was really Laura that was murdered after all.<br /><br />Love letters, an antique clock, and an alibi that just doesn't add up, all factor into the serpentine plot. As Mark becomes more obsessed with Laura's portrait, he seems to be more intent on finding her killer, with Waldo and Shelby becoming the two most likely suspects. The film's theme of obsession ends on a psychopathic note, showing which one is not willing to give up his ideal woman to the other.<br /><br />The acting is magnificent, with the beautiful Gene Tierney perfectly suited to the icy and cool Laura. Dana Andrews is a revelation as Mark, and his truculent, sexy he-man attitude is nicely juxtaposed to the caustic almost effeminate performance of Webb. But it seems odd to me that Shelby and Waldo; the films two prissiest men are even attracted to Laura in the first place.<br /><br />Adding to Preminger's accomplished direction is the arresting cinematography by Joseph La Shelle, which creates a moody, tension fuelled atmosphere. Laura is a provocatively twisted tale; a very satisfying seductive thriller that explores the nature of unrequited love and the notion that misplaced romantic infatuation will always end in disaster.

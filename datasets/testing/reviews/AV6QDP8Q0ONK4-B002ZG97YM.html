<meta name="summary" content="ANDROCLES AND THE DRAGON"></head><body><p>Hiccup is a Viking ahead of his time. He is able to look at his own society much as an outsider would view it (Similar to "Eric, the Viking"). The village is besieged by dragons, but such is life for a Viking. Hiccup, as an intellectual Viking creates a weapon that is able to injure the infamous Night Fury Dragon, one that has never been seen by his people. Hiccup tracks the injured dragon on his own, however is unable to slaughter it when it lays defenseless trapped in ropes from his own weapon. Rather he cuts the dragon loose. They become friends as he brings it food. Hiccup splits his time caring from the dragon he names Toothless, and attending dragon school. He learns secrets by about dragons by caring for one. He applies what he has learned to dragon school, much to the amazement of his fellow students and instructors, becoming a child hero and legend. There is a young blond Viking lass he wants to impress. The plot is predictable and the movie is wonderful.</p></body></html>

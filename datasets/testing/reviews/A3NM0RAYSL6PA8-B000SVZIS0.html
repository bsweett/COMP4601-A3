<meta name="summary" content="Awful.  Not even the cool make-up saves this film."></head><body><p>What happened to Tim Burton. Or, perhaps more accurately put, what happened to the image of Tim Burton propogated so well by Hollywood? After watching his remake of PLANET OF THE APES, all I can say to Mr. Burton is take a bath, get a haircut, and drop the brooding genius pretense. There is nothing brilliant, artistic, or even mildly above average about this film. Think "Stargate Meets Planet of the Apes." And even a horrible film like Stargate had an ending we could understand.<br /> But, then, maybe that's Mr. Burton's game. Present an ending that even Socrates couldn't unravel. There! That's the proof of his brilliance. Only he of old man sunglasses and dirty hair is capable of understanding this "twist." Sorry, though, I don't buy it.<p>The ending of this film is so bizarre and so stupid that it defies belief. But it is worth dissecting it if for no other reason that to project what the sequel might be. (Oh, there will be a sequel. The ending begs for one. "Please, give me chance to explain this shocking non-sequitur!") Here are my best guesses for the sequel:<br /> (1) It was all a dream. Marky Mark is a zookeeper who wakes up from this nightmare, frees all of his chimps, and falls in love with a particularly attractive Orang. (She'll be animatronic in the film--with perky, human-like breasts, perhaps.)<br /> (2) Marky Mark entered a parallel universe in which an ape version of Tim Burton is making Planet of the Humans. Mark is recruited to star in the movie and is ultimately placed in a zoological park for retired animal actors.<br /> (3) Marky Mark was driven insane by his experience with apes and now sees all humans as Apes, including his mother--which leads to some dramatic incidents involving bananas.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="IRON MAN is a BLAST!"></head><body><p>Iron Man has been a favorite of mine since childhood and they got this one right. Marvel's best superhero movie to date (yes Spider-Man fans!). 2008 saw 2 great superhero movies (Batman: The Dark Knight was probably the best movie in 2008) that did not disappoint.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. was marvelous. The 2 disc addition is the one to own.</p></body></html>

Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? He looked really feminine and mime-like. It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makeup on him! Depp's character had a really awkward and uncomfortable feel (done on purpose but not in a funny way) with bizzare, dead sounding dialogue. The musical numbers were not catchy and there was an odd lack of music through the rest of the movie giving it a really inhuman, unnatural ambiance. I also disliked the one guy playing all the oompa loompas, it looked really fake like a clone attack and did nothing to make the movie more watchable. I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a little kid it's way too dark and scary and has 'humor' that is hard for most people young or old, to understand. I found myself asking, "Was that supposed to be funny?" on multiple occasions. The children (other than Charlie, who is underdeveloped) are really mean and bratty to the point of being unwatchable(as if we need more bad examples for kids!) Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. All the actors in this movie are very talented and it's a shame to see that something about this movie just didn't 'click'. This movie was not really about kids, or fun or candy, it was about Tim Burton falling in love with his own work and failing to realize how lame it was. Tim needs to stick with his own original stories (Corpse Bride for example, was great) and I think it shows a huge ego when someone tries to remake a classic movie like this! It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script is hollow and lousy. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. It has a very cold, lifeless feeling to it and had none of the warmth and joy of the original, almost like someone made a bad parody of WW. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, I wasn't entertained in the least and I think this fails as a kids movie and as a grownup movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!</p></body></html>

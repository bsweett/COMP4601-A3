<meta name="summary" content="Yeah.. I'm gonna need you to come in tommorow."></head><body><p>This is my all time favorite comedy. Believe me, it's abssolutley hilarious.<br /><br />Peter Gibbons goes to work at Unitech every day and works basically in a cubicle. His friends Michael and Sharim also work with him. Sharim has problems with the copier which he wants to throw out the window, Michael has problems because his name is the smae as a singer (Michael Bolton), and Peter has "a case of the mondays" and just wants to stop working. Their boss is one of the funniest characters with his awesome lines( yeah..... I'm gonna need you to come in tommorow..). Milton is also funny as he is a small nerdy man who isn't receiving a paycheck who is obsessed with his red stapler. The commotion over the stapler is absolutely hilarious! Then, when Peter's friends get layed off, they all join together to rob Unitech of its money even though Peter got a raise for "doing nothing"! (His boss hates him but the consultants love him)<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston plays Peter's love but one of the funniest moments is when one employee gets hit by a car while driving to work. He gets insurance money and gets to retire. He then hosts a party saying how lucky he is even though he is in a wheelchair with both of his legs broken! Absolutely hilarious. I'm not going to give away any more of the millionssssss of jokes but I really reccomend this to anyone in the mood for some good laughs.</p></body></html>

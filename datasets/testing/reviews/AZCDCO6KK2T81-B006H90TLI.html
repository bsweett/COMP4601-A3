<meta name="summary" content=""No Country for Old Men" is very uneven, but interesting."></head><body><p>I'm sorry, but I just don't get all the hype about these directors/writers and their films, especially this one.<br /><br />I found this film to be very uneven.  The cast is excellent and compelling to watch from start to finish, but the story is all over the place.  The first half is outstandingly well-paced and delivered, but the second half seems to be directed/written by others as it is noticeably different.  It pales in comparison to the first half.  I wish I could express better HOW this is so, but that is hard.  I just simply found myself no caring about the storyline much and a good thing since the ending is a complete clunker.<br /><br />I have to say that I was very disappointed with the extreme unevenness of this film, but it is good overall.  Nowhere near all the hype, but generally good.</p></body></html>

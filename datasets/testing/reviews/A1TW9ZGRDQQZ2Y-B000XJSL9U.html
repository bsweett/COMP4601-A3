<meta name="summary" content="A worthy entry into the Die Hard series"></head><body><p>I must admit that I found myself a little bored at times, not to mention that some of the dialogue was pretty bad. I actually liked the movie more as it approached an hour or so into the mayhem. Bruce Willis did seem to be just going through the motions, especially early on, but he still had some clever lines and action scenes later in the film. Justin Long, as the helpless computer nerd, was much funnier than I thought he would be and really got the most laughs out of my packed theater.<br /><br />All in all, the PG-13 rating didn't hurt the violence one bit, but having John McClane not throw aroung the F word every few lines really felt out of place in a Die Hard movie. Even his famous line is muffled by a gunshot.<br /><br />Still worth seeing if you like mindless action, with a little humor thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

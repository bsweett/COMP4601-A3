<meta name="summary" content="Like Fine, Aged Bourbon"></head><body><p>This movie is a reverie on death. Director Robert Altman unwittingly (perhaps) composed his own elegy with this film.<br /><br />It is a pensive mix of real and fictional characters who share life's stage, who weave in and out of each other's dialogue. Although there is more of the realistic than the supernatural here. You get what would be a typical Prairie Home Companion broadcast. Garrison Keillor's genius shines through - minus his signature Lake Woebegone report. But the goofy, all-too-apt ads for rhubarb and Minnesota pizza are there. Mostly, the music is there. Traditional folk/country songs are mixed with Keillor's original compositions. The actors do their own singing and all of them perform with heartfelt brilliance. They all could have second careers as song stylists. L.Q. Jones, the perennial Sam Peckinpah villain, delivers an especially moving turn. Meryl Streep has an angelic singing voice, pitch-perfect.<br /><br />It's the music that blends the real and unreal so beautifully. The result is like sitting down with a mix of bourbon and water at a favorite neighborhood bar. The lovely amber quaff will warm you into a gentle acceptance of the all of it - the raunchy humor, the camaraderie, and eventual death.<br /><br />Kevin Kline and Robert Altman do the DVD commentary. Their banter almost takes the form of one of Altman's improvised, overlaid film conversations. Kline makes some literary, amusing remarks, asks some pertinent questions. Altman responds a little lamely. But some interesting information about Altman's technique emerges - such as the observation that, in this case at least, Altman strove to make the camera a character "en passant" in the action.<br /><br />Kline and Altman sort of peter out toward the end of their commentary. But I still think the commentary is probably worth listening to. If for no other reason, it will give you a chance to view this wonderful, mellowing movie a second time.</p></body></html>

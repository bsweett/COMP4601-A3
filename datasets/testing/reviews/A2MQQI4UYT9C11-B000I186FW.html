Otherwise, I'm not a big fan of comic book movies, and might never have seen a very provocative and well-made film.  The near-future British setting recalls "Clockwork Orange", as does the man-vs-state story, although Hugo Weaving's "V" is a more admirable protagonist than Malcolm McDowell's Alex.  "V"'s V-alliterative soliloquy near the beginning and the overall production design are highlights, as is the history lesson on Guy Fawkes Day.  Surprisingly, Portman gets outdone by mask-wearing Weaving, who has the perfect voice for such a mysterious and threatening part.</p></body></html>

After hearing a year and a half worth of superlatives and castigations, for it seems no one was in the middle of the road about this one, I tried my best to have no expectations. I didn't entirely succeed, but it didn't matter much; this movie is nowhere near as impressive as I was hoping (far closer on the epic-flick scale to Eragon than The Return of the King), but on the other hand, it didn't have anywhere close to as much of the rah-rah-rah feel its critics chided it for as did, say, the remake of The Hills Have Eyes that appeared a couple of months later.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure everyone knows the plot by now-- didn't we all have to read this in school?-- so I'll skip a synopsis and go straight to criticizing the pace of the film, since there were any number of parts of this interminable movie that could have been shortened; I will try to avoid making the same mistake while reviewing it. It's been a good long while since I've read the book (and I distinctly recall not thinking much of it; if memory serves, I made it through this and Prince Caspian, then gave up after struggling through the first half of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader), but it seems to me there was a great deal of butchery involved in the first half of this script; I don't remember the novel being anywhere near this simplistic. And yet somehow it still manages to drag as if it were chained to a wardrobe itself. The first hour of the movie could have easily been rendered down into fifteen minutes. Or, alternately, it could have been used to give us a little more insight into the characters we meet during that first hour, rather than Adamson (who also had a hand in the script) and his collaborators assuming (I'm inferring here, but I think I have a good chance of being right) that everyone, having read the books, would already know these characters, saving the scriptwriters from the chore of having to let us get to know them again. Oops.<br /><br />Once the action starts up, the pace of the movie quickens, but it is sorely lacking the kind of expertise found in the action scenes of Peter Jackson (or, for that matter, Mel Gibson; the climactic battle plays far more like a less-inspired Braveheart than anything in the Lord of the Rings trilogy). It almost feels as if it's a highlight reel from the book that picked up every wrong highlight it possibly could.<br /><br />Just didn't work for me, on any level. The only thing that redeemed it-- kind of-- was some decent acting. * ?</p></body></html>

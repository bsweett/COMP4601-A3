And so it has. Here we get the icon from the long running series of "Alien" films that started way back in 1979 coming together with the Predator from the film series of the same name that started in 1987 and only had one other film. As far as the "Alien" movies go, this one isn't too bad of a new venture with the character with some nice moments, but is far from being a great representation. As far as the Predator goes, this is the best film for that character, since the 1987 original with Ah-Nold was mildly good, and the sequel in 1990 was extremely bad. The movie was written and directed by Paul Anderson, a man whose other work I have not seen. From what I uunderstand, this film is a sequel to the "Predator" movies, and a prequel to the "Alien" films. The story starts with something dastardly happening in 1904 at an Anartic whaling station. Immediatley jumping to present day, the discovery of a massive pyramid that is located way beneath the ice is located. Lance Henriksen, a nice nod to the history of the "Alien" series, plays Charles Bishop Wayland, who pulls together an elite group of scientists  to make the trek to Antartica and help him locate the mysterious pyramid. The scientists are made up of the usual fodder of people with different backgrounds and races, but the two stand outs are explorer Lex Woods(the lovely Sanaa Lathan), and french archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa, played by Raoul Bova. Once inside, the pyramid moves and changes every 10 minutes, and our captives soon learn that the place was a training ground for the predators to become hunters, and it's hunted were the aliens themselves. Soon three predators arrive as our captives do, which sets in motion the release of a gang of aliens from the queen mother, who has been held in some kind of crypto chamber to make new aliens so the hunt can begin. Most of the script and it's dialogue is mostly mumbo jumbo, because mainly the audience wants to see the good stuff. Unfortunatley, with it's surprising PG-13 rating, you won't be seeing the kind of good stuff you would probably want to see. There is some goo with alien guck and predator blood, but that is about as nasty as it gets. Why PG-13?. What in the world were they thinking?. The big team up between the two beasts happens about halfway in the movie, and while it is pretty good, it is also way too brief. The end battle is more running and trying to find something to stop whichever beast is left standing. Don't want to spoil it for you. So, the big grudge match really doesn't live up to the hype or deliver in the way that Freddy and Jason's showdown did. Big overture, little show. However, the movie is beautiful to look at. It is nicely shot and choregraphed, and it does look amazing. It makes the most of it's limited location, and for the most part, it works. The acting is pretty decent. Sanaa Lathan is no Sigourney Weaver, and I doubt she would try to be, but she holds her own pretty well in the role and gets the job done. It was very nice to see Lance Henriksen. He brought a sort of legitimacy to the proceedings, even if the end result does not really stand up to the best of the "Alien" series. I never liked the "Predator" movies. Always thought they were a poor man's "Alien". I can't give the creature the 'icon' title like the alien because I don't think the creature is. Not like the alien. It's a 90 minute popcorn/cotton candy monster fest. It does not really add upon the existing franchise of "Alien", but it does deliver the best of the "Predator" movies. It should of been R rated as well. It is not an overly great film, but is far from being the worst piece of trash ever captured on film. Talk about an overreaction. It is definitley watchable and entertaining, with some nice shots and moments here and there, but nothing more.</p></body></html>

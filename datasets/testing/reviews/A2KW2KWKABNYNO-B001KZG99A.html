<meta name="summary" content="The Best Superhero Movie So Far..."></head><body><p>I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.<br /><br />The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.<br /><br />The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.<br /><br />The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.<br /><br />Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.<br /><br />Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.<br /><br />Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.<br /><br />Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. As for it's Blu-Ray value, it's a must-own. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I knew that was Justin Timberlake"></head><body><p>The movie was about how Shrek had to make the decision about whether he wanted to be king or not. He has no desire to be in charge, but he has to find someone else to take his place so he won't be stuck with the crown.<br /><br />Pros: I love everything about Puss n' boots, and it's no coincidence that I'm that smitten with Antonio Banderas, too. Both the cat and the man have major swagger. Although I can't get into some of the movies Eddie Murphy has been in, he does a great job as Donkey. I don't think anybody else could be quite as funny as he is playing that part. Same goes for Mike Myers as Shrek. But I just kept listening to Artie and thinking, "He sounds so familiar." Mr. Sexyback Timberlake is playing his role, and he did an excellent job. I fell out laughing at the line about "relating" to him.<br /><br />Like the other two Shrek movies, this movie was funny, the technical animation was impressive, the plot was interesting and I loved how strong the women were. I was amused with them getting into position--classic. Good to see my buddy Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man, too. Great movie. The jokes in this Shrek series is better than most of the comedic films out for the past 10 years--the writers didn't try too hard. The film was just naturally amusing. I highly recommend it. I can't wait to see the final movie in a couple days.</p></body></html>

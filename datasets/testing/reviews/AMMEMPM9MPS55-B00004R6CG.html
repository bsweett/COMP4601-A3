<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock's finest film"></head><body><p>A typical first reaction to this film is disappointment. I, too, was somewhat deflated when, having been introduced to Hitchcock through Psycho and North by Northwest, I saw Vertigo and wondered what the fuss was about. On subsequent viewings, however, the film has become to me the masterpiece I expected it to be in the first place.<p>Its success cannot be pinned down to the plot or the thrills, because purely as a suspense thriller it is only adequate. The dialogue is not breathtaking, and if we expect a taut, credible storyline, we will not be satisfied; but that is hardly the point, for Vertigo's power lies in the emotions it conveys. Hitchcock's colours, Burks's ethereal lensing of San Francisco, Herrmann's score and the fittingly passionate performances of James Stewart and Kim Novak bring vitality to a story that could otherwise have been pedestrian. The more I watch this film the more I allow myself to be swept away in its tide of emotion: The sense of yearning for lost memories; the desire to recreate the past; the frustration of being trapped in time; the mythic quest for beauty. These themes are at the heart of the story, of course, but more than that, they are revealed in the entire ambience Hitch successfully creates: The dreamy settings entrance you and pull you into their spell; The film's key images haunt you long after the film is over. It is hard to describe the power Vertigo contains: It ought simply to be experienced; Let its themes and images and sounds wash over you.<p>When I am drawn back to the film, it is precisely because of that sense of yearning for something lost. I want to let it affect me all over again. I want to relive the experience. Vertigo does not only tell you about this intense human desire to relive the past: It makes you feel it.</p></body></html>

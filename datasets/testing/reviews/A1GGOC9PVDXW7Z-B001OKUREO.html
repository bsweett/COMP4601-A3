<meta name="summary" content="George W. Bush: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me... and won't get fooled again.""></head><body><p>Oliver Stone establishes at the beginning of "W." that's it's fictional, with George Jr. imagining he's the Texas Rangers centerfielder. Conversations are invented, facts altered, important players eliminated, composite characters presented as real. Later, there's a dream sequence where Jesus tells Dubya to run for president, him drifting off to fantasy land during a strategy session and a nightmare of Pappy Bush challenging him to a fistfight.<br /><br />He's portrayed as two-faced: gregarious with the public but a bully with staff and team members. Bush eats like a pig: with his mouth open, takes a dump in a small hotel room with the bathroom door open and wife Laura nearby. He's too stupid in a press conference to answer a simple question: what's your biggest regret? Fumbles with it for two minutes. Stone relishes such bad light moments as Bush choking on a pretzel or fighting with his parents.<br /><br />At the end, after it's learned there were no WMDs in Iraq, and that the president has antagonized the world by his invasion and overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he blames everyone but himself. The last scene mimics the first: Dubya stands at the centerfield wall, looking stupidly for an invisible fly ball. (You dropped the ball, George!)<br /><br />In the director's commentary track, he never once pronounces Donald Rumsfeld's last name correctly. Why is that?<br /><br />It's no surprise that "W."  is as big a hack job as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019QEXYS">NIXON</a> (1994).<br />The only worse Stone films may be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AF4Y9G">NATURAL BORN KILLERS</a> (1995) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PLLNQ">ALEXANDER</a> (2004).<br /><br />Recommended: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AUJR">SALVADOR</a> (1986), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004X13U">TALK RADIO</a> (1988) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767805763">U TURN</a> (1998).<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.5) W.

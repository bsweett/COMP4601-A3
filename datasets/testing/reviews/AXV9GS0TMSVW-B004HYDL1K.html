But while the Grindhouse pairing almost tried too hard in mixing original storyline with its homage, Machete revels in exploitation film conventions.  The result is a mix of over the top action, ridiculous violence, and gratuitous sex and nudity.  It makes no attempt to be deep, even though it has some biting satire towards immigration policy.  The film is ridiculous fun.<br /><br />The film's greatest asset is Rodriguez's slight of hand film making.  This film was made for 10 million, and while it has an intentional cheap feel, some of the actions scenes could have easily being pulled from a 100 million dollar blockbuster.  The action is very funny and very stylized.  An early use of interesting props in a hospital is the tip of the iceberg for me.<br /><br />The characters are equally fun.  Machete is a typical action here whose actions speak much louder than his words.  Danny Trejo is a perfect fit for this role, as he looks cold and serious, but is able to deliever the over the top action and such fun lines as "Machete don't text" without cracking a smile.  The supporting cast is equally impressive, particularly Robert De Niro, a proponent of immigration form who takes his disdain for immigrants to new highs.  De Niro plays a very stereotypical white politician with a slight southern accent.  De Niro's performance has a perfect subtle charm to it and as goofy as this movie can be, is probably one of the better roles he's had in a while.<br /><br />The story is not important and is actually the weakness of the movie.  It involves Machete being set up to look like he wanted to murder De Niro's character.  But as characters flood the movie, the story gets a little muddlded.  This never stops it from being fun, but can make the film a little more busy than it needs to be.<br /><br />Don't go in expecting something deep and appreciate the film for what it is and you will enjoy it.  Flawed, yes, but this as fun a Robert Rodriguez movie as you can hope for.</p></body></html>

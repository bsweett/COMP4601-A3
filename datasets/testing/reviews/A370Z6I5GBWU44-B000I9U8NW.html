<meta name="summary" content="Cool sequel"></head><body><p>This is a decent sequel to the first film. Yes, the film does not follow canon exactly, but it is still a film worth checking out. Special effects are also cool, and the plotline is coherent. I know some people don't like this and from what I see the reactions are mixed, but as long as you set aside expectations that this is going to be exactly like the comics, I think you will enjoy it.</p></body></html>

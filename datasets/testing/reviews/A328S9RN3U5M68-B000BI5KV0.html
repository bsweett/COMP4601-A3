<meta name="summary" content="The Sacrifices of Procreation and the Timeless Dignity of the Emperor Penguins"></head><body><p>As a moment of respite and perspective in a world cluttered with tribal warfare, human responses to natural disasters, and the garish flames of politics, MARCH OF THE PENGUINS reminds us of the eternal cycle of life, life perpetuated against all manner of foes and odds, and helps us re-center our blurring focus. This eloquently beautiful film, a documentary that goes well beyond the genre limitations, is a work of art by Director Luc Jacquet and his fearless crew of photographers, and as art should, it brings a subject into focus that reminds us of the space each organism occupies with dignity on this troubled planet.<br /><br />The story is simple yet profound: the Antarctica Emperor penguins yearly march from the sea to the breeding grounds, mate monogamously, procreate, the females leave their egg with the fathers and return to the sea for food, returning to nourish the new chicks, relieving the fathers to make their food trek to the sea, returning to relieve the mothers who depart for food only to return and conjointly raise their newborns, then make the sacrifice of leaving the chicks to mature and plop into the sea to begin the whole cycle again. These elegant and warmly humorous birds endure the outer extremes of nature all for the sake of nurturing their progeny. The cycle is fascinating in its centuries old repetition of ritual and wonderfully pertinent to the re-evaluating the human family unit!<br /><br />The photography is magnificent, finding not only the intimacy of the penguins, but the rapture of the frigid sea where they dive impossible depths for foods, and also the majesty of the Antarctica complete with 'Southern lights'. This film is a work of magic and happily can be shared with all generations, each segment from the very young to the very elderly will find a special message. Highly Recommended.

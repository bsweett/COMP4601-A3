<meta name="summary" content="Moving tale of Eminem"></head><body><p>To be perfectly honest....Im not the biggest Eminem fan but this movie which chronicles the period in Eminems life when he was down and out is a stirring, gripping tail of a talented artist discovering his potential.  He battles homelife,  poverty and quasi gangsters and ultimately becomes the winning underdog at the freestyle rap battle.<br /><br />  So pick it up today even if you dont like Eminems music,  youll root for this underdog thats for sure.</p></body></html>

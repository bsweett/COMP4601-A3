<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Pixar Film!"></head><body><p>I have seen every single Disney/Pixar film so far, and I think they just keep getting better.<br /><br />That is definately the case with this one. The Jack Jack Attack! short is hilarious! The animation is better than ever, and the plot is very good, and funny.<br /><br />If you are a fan of these films, or of good entertainment, this film is for you.<br /><br />Not just for the little squirts!</p></body></html>

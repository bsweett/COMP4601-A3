<meta name="summary" content="making the impossible believable"></head><body><p>As someone who has never seen the original &quot;Brat Pack&quot; version of &quot;Ocean's Eleven,&quot; I have no romantic ties to nostalgia and I saw the film with an open mind. I really don't care for plot lines that glorify crime as something that is exciting and without real victims, but the film has so many twists, turns and moments of excitement, you quickly forget that this is about the mother of all robberies and instead feel like you are a member of Ocean's team.<p>Carl Reiner is absolutely fantastic in his role and really helps to tie the film together.  Bernie Mac is also masterful in his performance.<p>Andy Garcia does such a good job at being a king-sized jerk (even though a few of these scenes were a little overwraught), you not only don't care that he's being robbed, you actually want to join in just to see him wince.<p>The plot is very clever and the story assumes that you (the viewer) are intelligent and are already thinking, &quot;No way, man... I saw a behind the scenes show on Discovery Channel and there is no way on earth you can rob a casino on Vegas!&quot; and then makes you believe it really is possible.<p>Of course, cameras are EVERYWHERE in a casino... and if you so much as picked your nose in a casino 10 years ago, there is most likely a video archived on a shelf somewhere showing your nose being picked from 3 different camera angles.<p>Nevertheless, you will find yourself smiling during the twists and turns and very clever ideas... because your mind is stimulated instead of being lulled into a coma.<p>Well acted, great direction, believable &amp; clever plot... makes a great movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sympathetic Characters Who Can't All Win"></head><body><p>Being honest, I did not much like the 1st "Pirates." However, I found this 2nd chapter to be a major improvement. A certain annoying character kind of ruined the subtle spooky horror Part 1 could have had. But fortunately, he never reappears now.<br /><br />Johnny Depp (Sparrow, I mean of course Captain Jack Sparrow) has of course gotten his ship back. But we see that he is in trouble with Davy Jones. (Depp owes a huge debt that has to be payed.) So, Depp is doing what he can to win some negotiating power of Jones. (Find his weakness, namely his heart, and hold that over Mr. Jones.) Will finds himself trying to save Elizabeth, and then his father. Of course fate will bring Depp and Bloom together. Granted the island of 'some undefined religion' seems a little silly, but at least it offers some laughs.<br /><br />In an interesting plot, Elizabeth joins the party looking for Will. We also meet a worn out James Norrington. While he was pompous and not so likable in Part 1, his destroyed defeated state allows us sympathy for him now. While we're on this subject, Elizabeth's father has also become a more sympathetic character.<br /><br />It's hard too say much without ruining the movie, but we have an interesting situation where we feel at least some sympathy for Captain Sparrow, Will, Elizabeth, and even James Norrington. But we also know that they aren't all going to get what they want in a neat package that doesn't do anyone else any harm.<br /><br />Another character worth some attention is Mr. Davy Jones. He is this interesting character that has elements of Gothic Horror but yet also sea horror. (A nice character who fills the emptiness left by Geoffrey Rush's death in Part 1.) Mr. Jones is really, really, bad. But he carries a charm that makes it virtually impossible not to like him a little. He wants Captain Sparrow's soul. But he is willing to negotiate. For 100 souls, he will consider Captain Sparrow's debt payed.<br /><br />Perhaps the most sympathetic character in the story is Will's father Bootstrap Bill who is trapped in Davy Jone's service. In a game of dice, he gives up any hope of salvation to save his son from Davy Jone's wrath. (Try to keep a dry face when he helps his son escape and says: "What more can they do to me?")<br /><br />Without going on too long, Captain Sparrow and his 'friends' find Mr. Jone's heart and only vulnerability. Then, we find that Captain Sparrow, Will, and James Norrington all want Mr. Jone's vulnerability for different reasons, and we have a dramatic, but not totally void of laughs 3 man sword fight. Soon, we see why we needed a few laughs here.<br /><br />There is a huge fight at sea. Mr. Jones is of course trying to get his one vulnerability back into safe hands. And he unleashes his HUGE monster. Captain Jack Sparrow wants to run, but he has a crisis of conscience and in a dramatic moment, flips the tables at least for the moment on this terrible monster. This really serves to underline the atrocity of betrayal from Elizabeth.  If you're on this website, you probably already know what happens after Johnny Depp pulls out his sword and says: "Hello Beasty."<br /><br />From here, there is utter sadness and what I consider the most sad, evil, and totally void of conscience cliffhanger end I have ever known. There is some hope when a character from Part 1 (who should be dead) suddenly returns to offer help. But of course, we want to know how he cheated death, and of course why he would offer help to his former enemies. (One of who killed him in Part l.)<br /><br />If you haven't seen his yet, I strongly suggest you have a copy of Part 3 "At World's End" on hand. You probably won't want to wait too long before you know what happens from here.</p></body></html>

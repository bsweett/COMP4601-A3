<meta name="summary" content="As Influential Now as It was Then"></head><body><p>I still consider The Exorcist the most influential movie I have ever seen as it had me question, as those involved intended, what it is that I believe.  I grew up in a mixed home in that my mom was a devout Christian and my father was a devout atheist, and I dated a Jewish girl through most of my high school days.  I never knew what to believe.  My parents always wanted me to make up my own mind, but both attempted to influence me with their individual beliefs.<br /><br />I viewed The Exorcist on its re-release in 1975 (or so) when I was around 12 or 13.  It scared, forgive the pun, the hell out of me, but more importantly, it made me THINK!  I began to both read The Bible and books on the occult.  In addition, I bought many scientific books as well to see what they had to say on certain religious themes.  I am thankful for such an influential film as The Exorcist which began a five year journey for me to discover what I believe in.  There are very few films that make one think about such heavy issues as life and death, heaven and hell, science and God, and so forth.<br /><br />Some films have a way of staying influential inspite of time and some go way beyond what their genre typically entails.  While this is a movie, it much more than "just a movie".  In addition, this film is definitely NOT just another horror story.  The Exorcist belongs right up there with other influential classics such as To Kill a Mockingbird, Natural Born Killers, Roots, The Killing Fields, and Platoon, and other such thought-provoking films that either make a statement or ask us to make one.  The very fact that after 30 years this film still has the power to move us speaks volumes to its importance and influence.</p></body></html>

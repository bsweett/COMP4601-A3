I am not familiar with the comic book character other than Blade is half human and half vampire. The special effects in that movie blew me away. I was a bit wary of the sequal but after seeing &quot;Blade II&quot;, that movie was just as good as the first. I'm a huge vampire fanatic and the last vampire film (&quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;) turned out to be a real turkey. &quot;Blade II&quot; definitely didn't disappoint me. I found the idea of Blade working with his enemies to eradicate this new breed of super vampires compelling. I must admit I was rather grossed out by these super vampires and watching them feed. When Blade rescued his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristopherson), I wondered if Whistler was going to turn out like Blade; half-man, half-vampire since he was infected with the same vampire virus. Some of the humorous moments in the movie came from Ron Pearlman's vampire character . My favorite character in the movie  I have to say is the vampire named Lisa, played by Leonor Varela.  I liked how strong-willed her character was. What I really enjoyed was the twists that the storyline of the movie took. I really didn't expect for how the movie ended and for one of the major characters in the film. Obviously Wesley Snipes watched &quot;The Matrix&quot; very carefully because a lot of the fighting scenes in the movie were heavily influenced by &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Now while &quot;Blade II&quot; is by no means Shakespeare, it definitely is one of the few modern vampire films that I thoroughly enjoyed without nitpicking the storyline apart. Truly an action classic.</p></body></html>

The plot is implausible and often bizzare but the performances are great. Reminded me  little of Pulp fiction in terms of style and very quotable dialogue. I'm not saying it isn't original but it definitely is in that category of weirdness. Ultimately Bridges character The Dude is one of the most memorable he's ever done. Goodman is very funny as a  partly deranged vietnam vet friend of the Dude&#62; he manages to be both offensive and sympathetic at the same time. Very cool movie.</p></body></html>

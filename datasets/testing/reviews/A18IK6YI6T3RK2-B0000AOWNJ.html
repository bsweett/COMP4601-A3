It starts with a bang and though it does flag at times, overall it keeps up the suspense.  Watts does a credible job with the lead, but the kid that plays her son is trying too hard to channel Haley Joel Osmant.  Though this story is a take on a Japanese film that was one of the top grossing film in the history of Japan, it feels highly original and I could not wait to find out how it would end.  If you are someone that likes suspense then you will definitely want to get this DVD, but if you see it late at night you might want to make sure you're not alone, it is spppooookkkkeeeyyyy.</p></body></html>

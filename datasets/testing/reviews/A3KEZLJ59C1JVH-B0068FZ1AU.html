<meta name="summary" content="It's okay"></head><body><p>"Mamma Mia" boasts an all-star cast and fantastic music by ABBA, but it doesn't rank as one of my favorite movie musicals of all time. The story revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a 20-year-old girl about to tie the knot on the beautiful island she resides on with her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep). Sophie has no idea who who father is (neither does Donna, for that matter), so she invites the three possible candidates (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard) to her wedding in hopes of reuniting with her true paterfamilias. Needless to say, Donna isn't exactly thrilled when three of her former lovers show up unexpectedly on the eve of her daughter's wedding, and of course hilarious hijinks ensue, followed by a totally unrealistic yet ridiculously happy ending.<br /><br />The best part of this film is watching some of my favorite Hollywood actors sing and dance like crazy. Some of them (Streep, Seyfried, Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters) are quite impressive, while others (pretty much all of the guys) are not. Also, I have no idea where this movie was filmed, but it's absolutely gorgeous and I totally want to go there!<br /><br />Overall, "Mamma Mia" is a fun little movie to watch, although I doubt I'll ever watch it again.</p></body></html>

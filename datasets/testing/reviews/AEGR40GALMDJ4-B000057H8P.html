No movie has ever gone into the Hollywood atmosphere to show how movies were made.  All the acting is superb.  Gene Kelly in this film is truely his best performance, as well as the laugh out loud Donald O' Connor.  Debbie Reynolds also plays a sweet innocent perfect character that she was born to play.  The music is fast paced and addictive, and unlike some musicals never slows down the pace of the plot line.  This is a definate film to see in your lifetime.  I highly reccomend this film.</p></body></html>

It is a visionary work that is unique and endlessly graceful.<br /><br />The reunion between ill-fated lovers Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) is disrupted by the theft of a sword called the Green Destiny.  The sword has been taken by the beautiful Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) who is determined to forsake her pampered existence.  Mu Bai's quest to recover the Green Destiny eventually leads to a showdown with the young thief and an old adversary from his past.<br /><br />Lee does a good job of examining the notion of romantic yearning through the characters of Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien and the notion of personal sacrifice in light of one's status through the character of Jen Yu.  Yet, it is the amazing acrobatics of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" that will catch your attention.  Your first impulse when you see the rooftop chase early in the film will be to guffaw at all the laws of modern physics that are being ignored.  At this point, you should suspend logic and embrace the special rules of Ang Lee's universe.  By doing so you will be able appreciate all the visual wonders that are on display later in the film.  Do not take "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" too literally and you will be privy to a rewarding viewing experience.</p></body></html>

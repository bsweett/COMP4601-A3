<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic"></head><body><p>First of all....many Marines say that the first 30 minutes of the movie about boot camp is THE most accurate depiction of Parris Island in cinematic history.  And of course Lee Ermey himself being a former Marine drill instructor tops it all....his profanity laced tirades are totally outrageous.<p>  Second of all,  the latter half of the movie deals with a subject not covered in Vietnam movies,  a squad getting lost and having to face a lone sniper.  Its a radical departure to be sure,  but Kubrick in his usual cinematic mastery makes it very gripping.<p>  So if you like Vietnam movies that are a bit different but still as strong as Hamburger Hill and Platoon,  check this one out....its fantastic.</p></body></html>

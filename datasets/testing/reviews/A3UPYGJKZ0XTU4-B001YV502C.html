James' dystopian novel set in the year 2027, where all women have been mysteriously infertile for 18 years. This world without children has deteriorated into chaos, ostensibly because there is little reason to maintain our infrastructures or composure if humans have no future. While the rest of the world wages perpetual anarchic war, Great Britain musters on, its government and industry still functioning. Refugees who have escaped violence on other continents stream into Britain illegally, where the authorities do their best to contain the immigrants in camps and shanty towns. Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a middle-aged bureaucrat, is kidnapped on the streets of London by a revolutionary immigrant-rights group calling itself "The Fishes". Their leader is Theo's ex-wife Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore). who implores Theo to help her obtain transit papers for a young woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who desperately needs to reach the coast.<br /><br />Julianne Moore's strong presence is the only thing that "Children of Men" has to recommend it. We don't see enough of her, and the rest of the film is completely forgettable. Too dull to be an action movie and too shallow to be anything else, "Children of Men" spends most of its energy wallowing in bleak, bluish, squalor. The production design draws attention to itself in every frame without ever managing to captivate. Squalor seems to be the principal theme. "Children of Men" is a chase movie, in which the characters are running away from one thing and toward another. That's fine for an action movie, but the action here consists simply of running or driving away from gunfire. The characters are woefully underwritten and the story simplistic. Oddly, "Children of Men" expresses its agenda in the background. Literally. The mistreatment of immigrants in the background of so many scenes conveys what are presumably director Alfonso Cuaron's views on immigration and open borders.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2007): Bonus features include deleted  scenes and 6 featurettes. "The Possibility of Hope" (26 min) are various doomsday predictions by social philosophers of the far left persuasion. In "Children of Men Comments by Slavoj Zizek" (6 min), social critic Zizek talks about what he sees as the true focus of the film, that being social oppression in capitalist systems. "Under Attack" ( 7 min) discusses the film's very long takes, with analysis of the opening sequence and  the car action sequence. "Theo & Julian" (5 min) discusses the characters. "Futuristic Design" (8 min) talks with set designer Jennifer Williams and production designer Jim Clay about creating the disintegrating society. "Visual Effects: Creating the Baby" (3 min) shows us how the baby delivery scene was created, including animating the baby. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.</p></body></html>

Not really about war or it's aftermath, but the waiting for a war to begin.<br />Anticpation can work on you. These Marines  are primed for action. It's oppressively hot, they are on edge, with nothing to do but [...] They are out on the endless vistas of the desert where the enemy can pick them off at any time. Jake Gyllenhaal does a creditable job as Swofford the author of the book, narrator & main character of the movie. Actually "Swoff" felt he had little choice. His father was a Marine whose life was screwed up by Vietnam, & his grandfather before that was also a Marine. So Swoff joined without a whole lot of conviction. They turned him into a sniper. Jamie Foxx is Sykes, Swoff's Sgt. & mentor. His mission in life is to keep his men alive. If he is not loved by his men he is respected & you'd want him to have your back. Basically, Jamie Foxx dominates every scene he is in. They all want action & desire to kill the enemy, including Swoff. Eventually war does come & Swoof is to get a chance to use the specialty he been trained for. At the last second, it is snatched away & hours later the war was over. I understood his frustration. Yet knowing he did not kill a man for any good reason might stay with him longer than his frustration. He never fires his weapon in war, his war, which he says lasted about four days, after half a year of inactivity in the desert. The horror of all those oil wells burning was brought to the screen in some great special effects. Scenes of boot camp are always fun, spotting the inaccuracies. More fun if you've been there. Don't expect much action in this "War" movie.</p></body></html>

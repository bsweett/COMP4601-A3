<meta name="summary" content="A Jewel in the Crown of Wildlife Documentation"></head><body><p>This deservedly praised-to-the-skies documentary, following one year in the life of the Emperor penguins of Antarctica, is such a heart-warming family classic that the wife and I watch it regularly. We do this as a tonic for the nastiness of today's world.<br /><br />Narrated by the immortal Morgan Freeman, directed by the great French director Luc Jacquet, the film's impact worldwide is unprecedented--and unbelievable. It impacted documentaries, produced at least one rip-off penguin documentary (although there was one great, earlier documentary also). It inspired Queen Latifah to narrate a similar documentary, and spawned two cartoons, the miserable HAPPY FEET and the incomparable tour-de-force SURF'S UP.<br /><br />(Even the Showtime Bunnies re-enacted-it-in-30-seconds, with a hilarious ending involving Morgan Freeman freezing in the snow and demanding a mocha latte.)<br /><br />With its quiet, meditative pace and gorgeous soundtrack, MARCH OF THE PENGUINS was dubbed for viewing all over the planet. French, Indian and other actors stepped forward to help narrate this film for the countries in which it was released. That is star power.<br /><br />Really, no one saw it coming when this film was made. The miserable conditions which the crew endured for about two years, the languid nature of the subject...all of it smacked of silly classroom stock. Even Freeman called it a "silly" movie and was taken aback by the fame it won.<br /><br />What's funny is this documentary format was nothing new to me. The Brits and Canadians perfected this style of wildlife documentary. I saw a fabulously great beaver documentary from Canada around 2002--I can't recall anything about it because there are about 15 beaver documentaries. I'll never forget the excellent documentary about sloths, narrated by the crazy-like-a-fox Tom Baker (yes, THAT Tom Baker).<br /><br />Get this for the whole family, and for posterity's sake. Don't leave home without knowing this great film is on your dvd shelf.</p></body></html>

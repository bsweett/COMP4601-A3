<meta name="summary" content="Kick-A** kicks you-know-what"></head><body><p>A high school kid who is a bit of a misfit tries on a superhero outfit, and before long, he becomes a folk hero. Kick-A**, as he calls himself, encounters a father and daughter who are also in the superhero business. Kick-A** unwittingly becomes involved in the killings of some local drug dealers and the mafia boss goes after him. The movie contains stylized scenes of graphic violence punctuated by dark humor, which make it exciting, funny, and unique. This was a terrific pre-summer treat that will be fun for those who see it.</p></body></html>

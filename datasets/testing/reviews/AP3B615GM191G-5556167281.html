<meta name="summary" content="It Doesn't Have To Be "HSM" For Kids To Like It"></head><body><p>Just recently, I watched this film with my younger sister, who is pretty much obsessed with the whole "High School Musical" phenomenon.  I wanted to show her the musical that defined MY childhood, but wasn't sure how she would react to the dated graphics and themes.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that she found the film to be very entertaining, from the goofy songs to the crazy characters to the wacky animation.<br /><br />In all honesty, though, what is not to like about this charming film?!  The areas in which the movie excels include:<br /><br />Plot: Simple enough (Nanny swoops down from above to take care of somewhat-neglected children) for children to understand, but with just enough political undertones to keep adults' attention, something that does not occur in HSM (in that series, either you buy into the catchy tunes or you don't...there's no middle ground).<br /><br />Acting: Julie Andrews (as Mary Poppins) and Dick Van Dyke (as chimney-sweep Bert) turn in incredible performances that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and there isn't a member of the supporting cast that doesn't bring something interesting to the table.<br /><br />Music: Of course, a musical film is ultimately judged by the success of its musical numbers, and in that case "Mary Poppins" is a rousing success!  It would take too long to rate all the musical numbers in this movie, but suffice it to say that they offer something for everyone.  I personally love the chimney-sweep's "Step In Time" upbeat dance, while my younger sister's favorite was, as she would said, "the one with the dancing penguins!".<br /><br />Overall, "Mary Poppins" is a movie that can be enjoyed by any and all ages from now until the end of time.  Please watch the film to sustain your own craving for nostalgia, then introduce it to your children/relatives to show them that musicals need not be set in high school.</p></body></html>

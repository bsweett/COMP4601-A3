This is a gritty story about revenge and redemption and the two saving graces of the film are Denzel and Dakota.  If Ms. Fanning can navigate through the shark-infested waters that mysteriously encircle child actors, I truely believe we're looking at a huge star for the next generation.  Marc Anthony first acting gig wasn't too bad either.  Truth be told, I expected less from him and I'm always thrilled when I'm proven wrong.  Christopher Watkins looks like he just showed up for an easy check and Micky Rouke seemed reduced to wallpaper.<br /><br />But it's all about the story, right?  And A Man on Fire, is a good story that will have your heart pounding, aching, and at last breaking.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

Unfortunately for Ree, her two kid siblings and her catatonic Ma, Dad put up the family shack and land for his bond. If he doesn't show, they lose what little they have. Set in the Missouri Ozarks, the film depicts the harsh living and harsher culture of the hill people who inhabit that part of the world. Men are vicious, women are horny-tough, kids grow up with no options but cooking meth, and the law exists only to the degree that the locals allow it to. To find her Dada and save the family home, Ree has to run counter to every unwritten, yet iron-clad, rule and assumption. The sense of risk, menace and distrust is palpable in every scene. Even family and neighbors can be counted on just so much for support.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence, as Ree, is a standout. Whether facing down the local sheriff or tenderly showing her brother and sister how to skin a squirrel, she is real and affecting. And John Hawkes, as Ree's rough-hewn uncle, strikes the perfect balance between wanting to help his nice and needing to heed the rule of the hills to save his own neck.<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" is just about perfect, as a film, but not a movie to see if you need an emotional lift.</p></body></html>

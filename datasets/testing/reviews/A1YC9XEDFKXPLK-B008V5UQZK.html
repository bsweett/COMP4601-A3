She is like the sleeper who has awakened and there's nothing to hold her back ! Except her father who does not approve of a non-Greek marrying his daughter or the fact that she wants to go to college...that is the stereotypical macho way of thinking in some cultures that may steam some people, but it does exist and cannot be denied ...Overall, this is a pretty good film with subtle humor that will still make you chuckle...It has to, otherwise please check for a pulse !<p>Yes, many of the jokes and witty banter for the most part were racially stereotypical; But not in a bigoted or negative manner. Anyone, from a Greek, Latin, or Italian background could somehow relate (and yes, I have Greek, I myself am Hispanic, and have Italian friends). We could all relate to many of the familial situations and very much saw the humor...I can also see where some reviewers did NOT get the humor if they are on the "outside"...That said...Yes, I am defending My Big Fat Greek Wedding. It was an enjoyable family film without having to go over the top with race jokes or take on a strong sexual nature (the romance scenes were just that, romance)...I think this is probably what disappointed some viewers is that this was a "clean" film. Funny how we have come along way from seeing clean films made in Hollywood. When one is made it is seen as a let down !</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="D for Dull"></head><body><p>T for Talkitive,B for Boring,or it could still be V for Vidiculous.this is comparable to a pop song;bland verses,heard it before choruses,lameassed solos.....but inbetween the muck theres an interesting bridge.in this yapfest,there are brief moments of action.this seems to be a trend in gollywood;either too much unbelievable action sequences,or unbelievably long winded talkathons.it seems that gollywood is trying to give us our monies worth not with good movies but in their length of time.as long winded as this is,another 10 hours wouldnt have made this yapfest any better/more coherent.ok,V(hugo weaving,PERHAPS,it could have been only his voice for all we know)has a grudge against the government of new america Aka Britain.as a guinea pig in a correctional facility,he was horribly burned and tortured when the place blew up.fast forward a decade or so and hes built himself a palace/batcave where the subways once was(of course the brilliant new government kept the underground wide open).i wouldnt have been surprised if the new government helped V place his jukebox.he begins his plot for a new revolution against this new government by blowing up its symbol of strength,parliment.V starts off by doing a test run on demolishing a semi important building.V then makes it to the tv station where the new regime sells its propaganda to make his plans known.natalie portman sports an adequate accent and is in better form than the abysmal final stars wars charactor she cried her way through.nevertheless,she is reduced to once again assuming the female role;whimpering until she is saved.anyway,by this time i was in and out of a dreamstate,the never ending blabbering can do that.i wont be the one to tell you how this ends(P for Predictable ?!?!?!?!?) but rest assured,gollywood will revisit this franchise in the making.surfice it to type,i wont be going along for the ride.unfullfilled hype once got the better of me!!!! fool me once</p></body></html>

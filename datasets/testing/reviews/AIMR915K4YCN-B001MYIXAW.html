It has replaced some heavy-hitters in LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH, THE HUNGER, NEAR DARK, and HABIT! I must say that I was very impressed w/ the innocent, yet terrifying atmosphere of LTROI. The kids, Oskar and Eli, are perfectly cast and utterly believable. The story has a depth and charm that transcends the genre, making it one of the most emotionally-fulfilling vamp-tales ever made. Don't get me wrong, I love the blood-letting and supernatural exploits too. I simply wasn't expecting to be hit so hard on an emotional level! I actually cared about these characters, wanting for their success. I rooted for them, hoping for the destruction of their enemies. Not since HEAVENLY CREATURES has a movie left such a horribly satisfying mark! Scenes like the Rubick's Cube, the morse code, the hospital visit, and the swimming pool (to name but a few) are scratched deep into my brain, moving effortlessly between touching acts of love and incredible acts of brutality. A flat-out masterpiece...</p></body></html>

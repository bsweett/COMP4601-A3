<meta name="summary" content="The ultimate challange for a great actor!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best films of loss, personal journey and redemption I've ever seen!<br /><br />Tom Hanks clearly deserved the Oscar for best actor of 2000 that year.  Faced with the challange of having to act through most of the movie with only himself, a volleyball and the brutalities of nature, he pulled it off miraculously.<br /><br />From the moment he is stranded on that deserted island, you're there with him, feeling every pain and every frustration he feels.  You feel every joy and every sense of excitement when he finally cracks that coconut open and when he finally creates a roaring fire.  How good that cooked crab must taste!<br /><br />When Hanks develops his personal relationship with his volleyball, Wilson, suspension of disbelief is not necessary.  You buy all of it, because you only need to image for a moment the madness and the yearning to talk to someone (or something) one must have to endure to survive on an island for four years.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Fierce Redemption"></head><body><p>Denzel Washington is great actor.  He gets a lot of work and sometimes the films he appears in just aren't up to his talent.  My favorite roles that I've seen are GLORY, MALCOLM X and TRAINING DAY (I believe he won Oscars for two and was nominated for the third).<br /><br />Now I'm going to add MAN ON FIRE to that list.  He's great in it.  He plays a haunted Black OPS hitman who ends every day with a Bible and a bottle of Jack Daniels...and a gun.  Christopher Walken arranges for him to be the bodyguard for a little girl in Mexico City, the kidnapping capital of the world.  Just as the little girl--who definitely isn't overplayed as a precocious tot (Dakota Fanning is wonderful too)--is showing Denzel how to live and connect and care again, boom, she's kidnapped.  And the movie is off and running.<br /><br />Tony Scott's stylistical flourishes keep the movie moving, and the intelligent script throws a few curves as Denzel tears through the underbelly of Mexico to get at anyone who had anything to do with the kidnapping.  If you're a fan of Denzel, there's a lot to love here in his performance.<br /><br />Great cast includes Mickey Rourke and the actor who played Mathis in CASINO ROYALE and QUANTUM OF SOLACE.</p></body></html>

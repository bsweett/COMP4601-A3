<meta name="summary" content="Classic animated fairytale"></head><body><p>This, the first full length animated feature, is undeniably a classic in its own right.  It's still one of the few Disney films that truly manages to capture the horror of its original source.  Grimm fairytales are notorious for their morose tone, and several of the more menacing scenes from the book are brought to life here.<p>In the movie Snow White is draped in rough garments to hide her beauty from the jealous Queen, but when her magical mirror informs her that she is no longer the 'fairest one of all', she sends a huntsman to kill Snow White.  When our heroine manages to escape, her trip through the horrifying woods, with branches and hollows looming out at her from the shadows is stunningly realised.  When she is rescued by the seven dwarves, that movie becomes a little more comic.  Thankfully the dwarves are never overbearingly cute, but remain ultimately winning, especially the mute Dopey and stuck-in-his-ways Grumpy.<p>The most important thing about this movie is though that it never veers too far in one direction.  It mixes light humour with inobtrusive songs and colourful scares.  In particular the Queen's transformation into a hag is just so well done that it would rival even some of Disney's later and more polished films.  There's even a little play with the subtext of the sexual feelings that Snow White evokes in her hosts.  This is a Disney movie to treasure.</p></body></html>

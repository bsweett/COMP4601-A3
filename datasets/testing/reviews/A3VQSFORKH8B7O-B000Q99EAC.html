<meta name="summary" content=""ROCKY" FINISHES ON TOP!"></head><body><p>With "Rocky Balboa," Sylvester Stallone brings the "Rocky" film series to its final conclusion. And, like  the title character, the series finishes on top! Stallone, even at the age of 60, still proves he has what it takes. His performance is great, and his writing and directing is nearly perfect! The rest of the cast and crew do a great job with the film. This is a fitting conclusion to a great series of films! If you're a fan of the "Rocky" films, or just love great dramatic films, then "Rocky Balboa" is the movie for you. By the time it ends, it will have you cheering. Count on it!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A</p></body></html>

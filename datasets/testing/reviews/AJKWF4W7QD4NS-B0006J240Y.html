<meta name="summary" content="Intriguing for a while, but that's it"></head><body><p>With a plot that seems like you've seen and heard it before, the Forgotten is intriguing for a while before it veers into Twilight Zone territory.  Julianne Moore gives a mostly solid performance as a grieving mother whose husband (Anthony Edwards) informs her that their child never existed.  It's impossible, she's sure of it, and she's even more ure of it when she meets a similarly grieving father (the Wire's Dominic West), and soon enough both are up to their eyes in a mysterious plot involving the NSA, and those that are even "higher up".  Normally the big twist and revelation wouldn't bother me as much as it did here, but it feels so hokey and tacked on that other plot holes and inconsistencies will soon make themselves apparent.  The Forgotten is still worth a look for mindless entertainment, and that's pretty much all to be expected from this.  Also featuring Alfre Woodard as a detective, Gary Sinise as a shrink who knows more than he's letting on, and HBO's Oz great Lee Tergesen as an ill-fated agent.</p></body></html>

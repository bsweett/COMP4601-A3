The new footage may not be noticed by everyone but it does make a subtle difference.  For example, Kyra (Riddick's love interest) in introduced by a short sequence of her arrival at the planet prison Cremitoria.  The scene helps the viewer to connect later references to her before Riddick ends up at the prison.<br /><br />The reviews here are sharply divided into those who like the film and those who don't see anything good in it.  The story is similar to other plot lines: an unscrupulous militaristic master race is taking over world after world and stripping it of resources.  They are also a group that forces the conquered people to become one of them.  This sounds something like a cross between Independence Day and Star Trek.  The Chronicles of Riddick has some very impressive special effects.  The Necromongers travel in space ships with anthropomorphic figures that lend them a coldness befitting military conquerors.  The ghost-like quality of Judi Dench's character is very well done as are the lightening quick movements of the Lord Marshall.  Calling this a realization of a lavish graphic novel is close to the mark.<br /><br />The performances are good: Vin Diesel does a fine job as the Furian anti-hero; Colm Feore (as he is usually cast) makes a fine villain.  It was interesting for me to see Karl Urban as Vaako out of his Lord of the Rings makeup and Thandie Newton was a nice addition as his ambitious wife.  Judi Dench may be thought wasted in Riddick but must we compare her performance in this film to something like Shakespeare in Love?  Judging by what she said about making the film, Ms Dench had a lot of fun.  And, yes, Vin Diesel does wear goggles, but the reason he wears them is part of his character not just a mindless prop.  In other supporting roles, Nick Chinlund, who plays the leader of the mercenaries that capture Riddick, does a great job as the indecisive and sleazy Toombs.<br /><br />I don't think critics care much for movie that just seeks to entertain.  So I can recommend this movie for the wild ride that it is - just plain fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Missing Ingredient"></head><body><p>This movie might be remembered for THE movie that brought down Disney's profitability this year.  There's nothing wrong with "Dark Water".  Impressive director, screenwriter and cast made this a resolute & intelligent movie.  However, it's missing an important ingredient and the sorely lacking potent ingredient is what prevented the audience from flocking to the cinemas in droves.  "Dark Water" is one of those movie that could be appreciated at home.  The essence of heading to cinema is to scare ourselves witless with those over-the-top soundtrack & gore factor.  "Dark Water" is never meant to be made to target at the younger crowd and thus, the lacklustre result.  Jennifer Connelly's previous movie, "Hulk" shared the same fate.  They are good movies but simply underappreciated.  Pete Postelwaite, John C Reilly, Jennifer Connelly were brilliant here but scary moments were far in between.  Towards the half of the movie, we already could guess the end-result and its plot.  As a result, the movie became the victim of the genre's success as it 'educated' the audience of what to expect.  Please  be mindful that the extras provided in the DVDs are quite negligible.  Commendable movie.</p></body></html>

That being said, what we have here is a pretty solid superhero story that does as much right as it does wrong, and could have been so much better than what it is.  As the story picks up, Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are together and happy, which soon gets spoiled upon the arrival of new villain Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) who is the real man responsible for Uncle Ben's death.  Not to mention the fact that a gooey, alien symbiote has latched itself onto Peter, and has allowed for all his inhibitions to get left at the door as he embraces his dark side.  The biggest problem with Spider-Man 3 is that there are too many characters in the story.  Sure, it's nice to see Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) in the movie, but she's here for little reason really.  What is also disappointing is having Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace) here as well.  Arguably the most hyped about aspect of the film upon it's release, Brock's character development is non-sensical, and while his transformation into Venom and usage in the climactic final battle are plenty good, he's just not here enough.  James Franco's turn as Harry/New Goblin is also quite underdeveloped, although when he's bad, he's good.  Despite the negatives, there is a lot to admire here, mainly Maguire's gleeful turn as the "bad" Peter Parker (with an emo haircut), and he is clearly having a blast doing it.  Stan Lee's cameo is the best the legendary creator has had in a Marvel movie yet, and Bruce Campbell once again pops up in a cameo, and provides some nice laughs.  The CGI effects are wonderful, and director Sam Raimi knows what he's doing, but it just feels like he wanted to do too much with too little time.  All in all, Spider-Man 3 isn't bad one bit, and you can certainly do much worse when it comes to mega budget superhero movies, but at the end of the day, the film proves sadly disappointing.</p></body></html>

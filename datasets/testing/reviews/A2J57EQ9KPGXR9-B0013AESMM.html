<meta name="summary" content="A decent anti-Gun movie, but actually Pro-Gun"></head><body><p>Jodie Foster stars in the movie as a woman, traumatized by violence, who goes on a shooting spree - Punisher-lite style. The Brave One is like a toned-down version of Punisher War Zone, minus the black costume, the big guns and all the cartoon violence.<br /><br />  I must admit that I fast-forwarded through the plot set-up scene (people run around late at night in Central Park not paying attention? Really? Nope. Stupid plot twist..) due to its silliness. So the woman reacts to her attack by getting a *gasp* Devil Machine - a gun. Immediately, it turns her into a short,skinny version of Frank Castle - blowing away "bad people" left and right. Of course, the cops are stymied, except for one guy of course.<br /><br />After watching the whole movie, I thought, y'know if she (or her boyfriend or both) had that gun in the beginning, there would'nt be any movie at all (personally, I think Jodie should have gone with a snub nose .357 instead of that 9mm - more stopping power and less chance of a fatal jamming incident, but thats just me..). And of course, she is able to get a gun illegally in 5 minutes, in Manhattan - OK, if you say so Jodie. Also, on a side note - you never see her cleaning the gun, a big no-no if you are going to use an automatic. The whole "guns are bad, they make nuts nuttier" premise of the movie is lost amid all the violence.<br /><br />The Brave One is not a horrible movie, however. I've seen worse. The acting is decent as well as the cinematography and the pacing picks up after the first 15-20 minutes or so. But the anti-gun message really misses the marke here.</p></body></html>

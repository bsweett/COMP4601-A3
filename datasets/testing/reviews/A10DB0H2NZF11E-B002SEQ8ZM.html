<meta name="summary" content="AWESOME MOVIE AGAIN"></head><body><p>Great movie.<br />Great story line....targeted to a younger audience but still entertaining<br />Great animation.<br />Great characters.<br /><br />FYI - There is one scene that seems a bit too adult for kids. It is a scene toward the middle of the movie where a woman with very large breasts is barely covered. The scene is about 5 minutes long. It is not overly sexual but, it is kind of strange to have it in a kids movie. So, 4 stars and not 5. I wish I could give it 4 and 3/4 stars.</p></body></html>

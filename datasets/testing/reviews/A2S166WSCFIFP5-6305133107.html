<meta name="summary" content="another great John Wayne movie"></head><body><p>The Cowboys is another great John Wayne movie, and after The Searchers, might be my favorite movie he has made. Wayne plays a tough rancher who is forced to use boys on a cattle drive. Wayne plays the role very well, tough and sweet, and has a great cast of boys supporting him (including A Martinez and Robert Carradine). Bruce Dern is the villain, and he does a great job in the role, but then this is the type of role Dern is best in. This is also one of the few instances where John Wayne is killed onscreen, and done so by Dern. The whole scene is one of the best I've seen John Wayne in. It's a great movie, unfortunately there aren't many extras on the dvd. There's a small featurette (less than 10 minutes), a few production notes, and bunch of trailers for John Wayne movies.</p></body></html>

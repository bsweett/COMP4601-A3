The tangled story centers on and around two philosophizing hit-men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) and their dark adventures entertaining their boss' drug-addict wife, and killing off his failed business partners. One of these partners is a prize fighter (Bruce Willis), who actually wins a fight when he, well, wins a fight; one that he had promised to lose, and lives to bask in the anonymous glory. <p>However, unconventional as the story lines are, the plots are not the point of this picture. In fact, despite the off-the-beaten-path plots, the events depicted in this film leave one with a sense of emptiness and unfulfilled expectation. Nothing happens in the film that matters, perhaps, because so much does happen, that the viewer is desensitized to the moral ramifications of the acts that are depicted. What ultimately redeems this film and, in fact, raises it above the league of most commercial movies is that it is so well crafted and audacious in its approach that it stands as a uniquely fresh masterpiece in American cinema. <p>Among the film's strident innovations is the elegance of the dialogue given to otherwise despicable characters. But, vying for equal attention is the ubiquity of stylized violence and the glorification of low values (such as drug use) that seems to pervade this film. Additionally, Tarantino, the product of a leading film school (U.S.C.), is adept at staging visually-lush sequences. One of my favorite and most innovative shots, for instance, involves the Bruce Willis character's conversation with Jackson and Travolta's boss (Ving Rhames). For the entire scene, especially, the first, extended shot, the camera avoids the conventional head-shot of Rhames while Rhames is talking. Instead, the camera focuses on Willis, who remains silent for several minutes, minimally responding to Rhames' dialogue with understated facial expressions. In another unusually staged scene, John Travolta delivers a soliloquy in a bathroom about why he should not go to bed with the boss' wife. <p>Tarantino's movies are also distinguished by the quality of their sound tracks. Pulp Fiction is no exception, being a trendsetter in its use of ultra-hip, and sometimes, revivalist choices. Of course, this `retro' philosophy is echoed in the casting choices that are made in his films, as we note that Pulp Fiction breathed new life into John Travolta's screen career, while tapping also new talents, such as those of Samuel L. Jackson. Finally, Tarantino's films are also distinctive in the way in which they develop a story line; they are seldom linear, stirring up disparate subplots, which are synthesized together by a meandering, often non-consecutive time line. <p>All of these elements in tandem - the clever dialogue, the rarefied violence, the retro soundtracks, and the unconventional story arches present us with a bold, new vision for movie making. Let there be no doubt; this movie is not for every palate. And, social critics have charged that its casual dispensation of gratuitous violence has led to a coarsening of our culture. But, putting aside those concerns, there can be no denying that Tarantino has taken film into previously uncharted waters. <p>PULP FICTION is the best effort so far that Tarantino has made to challenge and invigorate the cinematic arts in America. Every scene in this movie is powerful enough to stand on its own. In combination, however, they make for a very powerful film; one that overcomes the challenges that it, itself, raises.

<meta name="summary" content="Almost 5."></head><body><p>There is something special about Ang Lee's Hulk.  Much of it has to do with his style.  Lee has an almost magical sense of story, wading deeply into the backwaters of the subconscious, drawing out performances that ripple on the surface just enough to reveal the deep storms shifting within.  He is Jungian and Zen at the same time, understanding that placid water often disguises complex harmonies, subcutaneous rhythms.  Lee is, in short, the perfect storyteller for this tale of modern man, of alienation, of repressed anger, of denial of our true natures as mystical, animal creatures and, at the same, time rational beings that are trapped in a world in which neat rules are nothing more than a veneer.  There is a scene at the very end of Hulk in which David Banner tells his son, David, that his essence lies not in the thin shell of humanity, but in the torrential subconscious beneath--the place from which all strength, all righteousness, and all virtue springs.  It is from that powerful place beneath the protective skin of rational thought that one man might find away to save humanity from itself, or destroy everything in trying.<p>One might begin this review by acknowledging that the first half of Hulk might seem a bit slow, the way ordinary life seems slow, turgid, and familiar.  We are drawn into the lives of the characters in a way that current cinematic trends abhor.  Hulk does not begin with action and end with action.  It begins with veiled childhood memories, a story of dysfunctionality told through the eyes of a mysterious man who is both father and reckless scientist.  He is a man who, we learn later, is driven by that greatest of human qualities, and the wellspring of great peril: curiousity.  He is challenging the Heavens, we learn, by trying to improve upon man by unleashing man's essence.  And so, he turns the experiment upon himself, and then passes along the mutated genetics to a child who soon reveals himself as different, almost autistic in his connections to the world, and harboring the first generation of an almost alchemical secret, one which turns human flesh into a power that is almost God-like in its scope.<p>From the mysterious events of his childhood, David Banner, like all of us, lives out the psychic wounds in a failed relationship, in an inability to emote, in a laser-beam like focus on his "work."  He is a modern day "every man" for whom denial and obsession with work mask deep-seated alienation, rage, and denial.  All it takes is a blast of gamma radiation to set the stage for a torrential emotional outburst.  Like the protagonist in Fight Club, this is a man getting in touch with his feral, emotional roots.  And, as might be expected, he likes it.<p>The second half of Hulk is a stunningly efficient, and eminently satisfying, escapist adventure that amply fulfills the promise of the first, introspective hour.  The same kids who sat quietly through the first half will cheer at the amazing feats of strength, daring, courage, and, in two key sequences, compassion and heroism.  This is a real superhero whose strength is a rejection of the venal, and who finds in his rage a deeper humanity and humanism as well.<p>I loved Ang Lee's Hulk.  I plan on seeing it more than once.  It is an engrossing story that actually assumes its audience has a mind as well as a heart, and that puts it leagues ahead of the clodding action movies that have so far led the summer box office.</p></body></html>

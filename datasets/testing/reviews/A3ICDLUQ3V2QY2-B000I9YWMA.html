What became of the killer? Though the Ripper case was pretty small potatoes compared to some recent killers, taking the lives of seven women, the perpetrator is recorded as the first celebrity murderer, marking part of the transition to the cynicism of the post-modern era. Directors Albert and Allen Hughes attempt to reflect that transition with the latest film of the case, the self-consciously post-modern "From Hell." <p>  The title of the movie reflects the return address of a letter received on October 16th, 1888, by Richard Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, claiming to be from the murderer, along with a piece of one victim's kidney. As an example of this movie's excesses, this preserved kidney is shown on-screen, stewing in blood in a box. This image is emblematic of the amount of blood shed before the camera, which is no small part of why this movie fails. <p>  Johnny Depp plays Inspector Frederick Abberline, assigned to the investigation of the Ripper murders. Some people may consider this a strike against the movie, owing to Depp's past reputation as a professional heartthrob. However, he has demonstrated a capacity for more sophisticated acting in the past, especially while playing opposite Christopher Walken in "Nick of Time" (1995). Dressed in a period costume and speaking in an assumed accent, though, he somehow falls flat. <p>  Abberline is depicted as a debauched denizen of London's opium dens. This should serve as a first clue that we have strayed from historicity. The legendary opium dens were primarily found in the book "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," by Charles Dickens. Few actual establishments ever existed, and even fewer lasted any length of time, since the racist police wanted to chase such dirty Oriental influences away as quickly as possible. Abberline is also fond of absinthe and laudanum, which is hinted to be a way of dealing with the traumatic death of his wife. No one ever bothers to speculate as to how a man can use so many narcotics, spend so much time wrapped up in delusions, and still function as a police officer. <p>  Jack the Ripper is dropped almost whole in our laps at the beginning of the movie as the first two murders are perpetrated very quickly. Abberline seeks to find the murdered, alongside his partner, Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane), who is semi-corrupt and fond of quoting Shakespeare. They get off to a bad start as they follow a false lead, a protection racket with knife-happy enforcers. The initial time spent on the investigation is spent trying to get prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) to testify against her harassers. <p>  Previews for this movie made much of a supposed romance between Abberline and Kelly. In the actual presentation, however, gives them very little screen time together, and the sudden connection of the two comes without provocation. Shortly thereafter, Kelly disappears from the movie. She is seen briefly outside a small Irish cottage, but once she's out, for all intents and purposes she's out. <p>  It's plain that Heather Graham was introduced to the story because she's pretty. Her character contributes no more to the movie than the other prostitutes, yet Graham is billed as one of the stars. She has limited screen time and lank lines. Her inclusion in the movie is an example of the abuse of the star system in movies. If you're going to see "From Hell" because you liked Graham in "Bowfinger" or "Austin Powers," save your money. She's a drag on this film. <p>  The movie is lushly photographed, attempting to capture the degradation of Whitechapel in 1888. Location shots throughout the Czech Republic, where more 19th-Century buildings survive, lend a depth of realism that studio work couldn't reproduce. However, the reality of the environment is interrupted with such modern devices as stop-motion photography, and pans of camera angles that the average Londoner of that day wouldn't have been able to perceive. <p>  Some of the shots are marred by a comic-book appearance. This is not surprising, since the movie is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. In the transition from comic to film, however, the Hughes brothers elect to retain many of the visual elements of a comic book. Mixing images creates a very post-modern appearance that doesn't jibe well with the historical origins of the film. <p>  Moreover, the plot is too complex. Dragging in issues relating to Freemasonry, venereal disease, Queen Victoria, the Catholic Church, early psychiatry and crude medicine, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and class conflict, the story gallops along at a relentless pace, giving viewers very little time to pause and drink in what they've just seen. The frenetic pace is very tiring. Perhaps the Hughes brothers would have been better served trying to turn this into a TV miniseries. On the other hand, if they'd done that, they couldn't fit in the nudity, drug use, and profound amounts of blood. <p>  There have been some very good historical films of the Jack the Ripper case. "The Lodger" (1944) comes quickly to mind. This movie, despite the battery of names supporting it, never makes the transition to a movie from the comic book from which it came.</p></body></html>

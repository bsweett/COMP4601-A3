<meta name="summary" content="Still funny after all these years!"></head><body><p>2009 marks the 50th anniversary of this release by Billy Wilder. To this date it's a movie that has stood the test of time in comedy!Tony Curtis,Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe are first rate funny in this hilarious romp of a 1929 all girls band with Curtis and Lemmon dressed up in drag to avoid being caught George Raft and company. It's comedy at its best! I am glad to add this to my collection!</p></body></html>

He was both unreachably cold and yet also pathetically needy. His eruption comes late in the film, and it is somehow....not well handled by the makers of this movie. It was just not done right and left scant satisfaction to be had. Beyond that, I felt little connection to this predictable and by-the-numbers movie, and honestly it was a chore to get through.</p></body></html>

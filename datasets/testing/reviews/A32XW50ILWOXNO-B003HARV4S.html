<meta name="summary" content="Better as a sweet romance than whodunit."></head><body><p>"The Illusionist" bills itself as a turn-of-century head trip of narrative twists and inexplicable sorcery. And while the last half of the movie is an elaborate con, the true strength of writer/director Neil Burger's film is a simple romantic tale of love lost and found, featuring quartet of effective performances - including one from Jessica Biel.<br /><br />Yes, Jessica Biel, who adds a little acting to go with those lips and that hair. She's Sophie, a Hungarian countess who discovers a "forbidden" lover has become Eisenheim The Illusionist (Edward Norton). Eisenheim's tricks are seamless. It's also too quick for the magic-savvy crowds of Vienna, who can't unravel just how he grows that orange tree, or manages to freeze the sword of Austrian Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) so that no "unworthy" man can tug it off the ground.<br /><br />Leopold considers himself a divine intellectual above any trickery he can`t figure out, so he orders Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to shut Eisenheim down. By then, Sophie, who promises to marry the prince as part of a plan to overthrow Leopold's father, has shared a forbidden carriage ride with Eisenheim, and is ripe to share his bed, too.<br /><br />"Do you really want to disappear with me?" he asks her.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" then shifts into its hour-long final act, which involves a murder, jewels and voodoo magic that has the peasants rioting. Berger adapted Steven Millhauser's short story and added the romantic angle while flattening the depth of Inspector Uhl, rescued by Giamatti with mild humor and humility.<br /><br />Berger's twist - the "turn" in magician-speak -  is clever but predictable. "The Illusionist" has too gentle a soul - and too modest an aim - to end any other way,  but it works because Norton and Biel generate an understated chemistry; there's a lot of passion under their benign, expressionless faces.  Norton's is nobody's first choice as a romantic lead, which makes him more effective as a magician. Biel effectively plays against type as Sophie; what attracts her to Eisenheim is not his looks or fortune, but his sway over the mysteries of the world. She's captivated by his gifts, and Biel, a superficial actor until now, holds her own with the intimidating, enigmatic Norton.<br /><br />And finally, there is Leopold. Sewell is a magnificent Sunday ham,  marrying unbridled evil with anguished martyrdom - "I've done everything I can! Too much!" -  to create one of those pathetic ego monsters that echoes Peter Sellers and Christopher Walken. Inspector Clouseau, meet the King of New York.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="INTRODUCING  ALFRED SERLING"></head><body><p>You're late for an afternoon cocktail when you're suddenly mistaken for a spy, who doesn't exist,and kidnapped. You soon find yourself in a rural mansion, with two thugs pumping pints of liquor down your throat. You somehow negotiate your way back to New York where a diplomat is knifed to death in your presence at the United Nations. You're blamed for the murder,but escape on the Chicago Limited, as a nationwide APB is issued for your arrest. Aboard the train you're befriended by a female double agent who first protects you from the police,then arranges your death the following afternoon in an Indiana cornfield beneath the wheels of a malevolent cropduster! All this in a little over an hour of viewing time.Absurd? Of course it is! And, there's plenty more to come. Just hang on for what a really great movie should be-entertainment at its best.</p></body></html>

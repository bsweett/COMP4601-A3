This entry still shows that there's life in the series, although it doesn't do that good of a job showing you the possibility.<br /><br />This, as with the first two <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001MXXM">Friday the 13th</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001MXXP">Friday the 13th, Part 2</a>, begins where the pervious one ended.  This edition brings Jason back for his second go around and it's more of the same.<br /><br />Another recommended, but mostly for a watch release.</p></body></html>

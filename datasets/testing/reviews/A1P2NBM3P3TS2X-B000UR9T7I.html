This one simply was no fun at all.  It was a by-the-numbers film, and not very well written or executed.  Read below:<br /><br />First off, note that the screenplay was written by director Sam Raimi and his brother, not by more seasoned screenwriters as was the case with the first two films.  In this case it seems to have made a huge difference.  The script is weak and lazy.<br /><br />Secondly, the inclusion of the Sandman character seems completely superfluous.  He could have been cut out entirely and you never would have missed it.<br /><br />Thirdly, the plot hinges on geographic coincidences that would make a statistician slit his own throat in disbelief.<br /><br />And how many times can we hear Peter's Aunt May spout the same dialogue over and over again?  It seems like she gives the same speeches in each movie.  At about the 2 hour mark in this film, just when the audience is tired of it all and ready for the film to end, Aunt May launches into another one of her dialogue scenes that is so corny it made the audience giggle.<br /><br />The audience I saw this movie with was a large crowd made up of all types of people, and I could easily sense the audience's restlessness towards the end.  Few people seemed to like this movie and sure left the screening room in a big hurry when it was all over.<br /><br />This movie wasn't just disappointing, it was plain out insultingly bad.  Big budget, low creativity and originality.<br /><br />I decided before the film was even over that I would NEVER want to sit through this again.  Shame on Raimi for making such a piece of garbage.<br /><br />The special effects were spiffy and looked cool, but so what?</p></body></html>

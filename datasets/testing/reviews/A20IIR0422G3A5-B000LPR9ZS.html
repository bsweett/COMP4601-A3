<meta name="summary" content="Best trap scenes yet. Plot still threadbare."></head><body><p>`Saw III' directed by Darren Lynn Bousman is cut from the same cookie cutter script as the previous two movies, without the novelty of the first, but with just a scant improvement in plot over the second. The `Saw' series is the exemplar for an entire new genre of horror movie which can to some extent trace its roots back to `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. While these have been criticized as being nothing more than exercizes in blood and Sadism, I really find them big improvements over the very tired plotlines arrising out of the Halloween model which has been done to death a at least 13 times over and more. The basic premise replaces the na?ve teenager oblivious to the danger lurking behind him, with a fully aware victim in imminant peril that they fully appreciate, and which is drawn out with building expectation rather than diving in with a quick kill. Thus, in spite of all the gore and paraphenalia, there is much more psychological terror and vicarious fear being dished out here than by most appearences by Freddy or Jason or whomever.<br /><br />The other side of the coin is the realization of how bare these movies are of new ideas. The whole premise of the first movie was culled from a three minute scene from `The Road Warrior'. And that was the best of the three movies. One of the opening `trap' scenes in this movie was taken from a similarly short scene in the first `Hellraiser' movie. The voice-over commentary from the director and producers make great exclamation on how well things are executed in this movie, totally ignoring the fact that the story line is radically disconnected and the behavior of the characters is improbable at best.<br /><br />There is much to the criticism of this sub-genre of horror movie, and the criticism would lead to believing that the films had no value whatsoever, except that nobody else is doing the `Perils of Pauline' sthick at all, let alone well. That said, I will say that the `traps', that is, `the good parts' in this movie, are just a bit better than `the good parts' in `Saw I' and `Saw II'.</p></body></html>

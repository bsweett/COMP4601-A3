<meta name="summary" content="FUN RIDE: and That's What We Want"></head><body><p>After that dreadful remake called (For"Get Carter"), another Michael Caine film is brought from the vault.  Mr. Caine himself in one interview made it clear that he is very proud of the original film made in 1969, and I am sure he will not be so sad after watching this slickly done remake.<p>The new story itself is loosely connected with the original, so let's stop saying 'remake? not again' and see this one as a well-crafted heist movie.  The premise is surprisingly simple.  One heist in Venice leads to double-crossing, and after one year the betrayed thieves get a chance for revenge in Los Angels.  The film features gripping sequences of stealing a big heavy safe, wild motor-boat ride (that must have scared the people in Venice) and car chase of three Mini-Coopers, which literally steals the show with very useful agility.<p>Actors are all good, but all typecast, so you can tell who is the traitor or who got killed while watching the opening credits.  Two names might attract you such as Mark Wahlberg as Charlie, nominal leader of the group, and Charlize Theron as Stella who decides to break the law for her personal reasons, but it is supporting actors like computer-wizard Seth Green or Jason 'Handson Rob' Statham that really impress you with unexpectedly comical turns.  You also see Edward Norton, Mos Def, Franky G, and ubiquitous Donald Sutherland.  Michael Caine does not appear himself, probably because of his regret of having done it in "Carter," but it does not mean that he is all gone from the film.  Try to spot 'him.'  <p>The greatest value of the film lies in F. Gary Gray's skillful handling of the characters, and his proficient staging of actions, especially the ones using three Mini-Coopers.  But why Mini-Coopers, you might ask.  Like the original, these characters have to use them in the crutial scenes, so let's not say this is product placement.  Actually, you may say those cars running like daredevil are the true star of the film.</p></body></html>

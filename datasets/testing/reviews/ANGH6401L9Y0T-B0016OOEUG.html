<meta name="summary" content="Vintage Detective Story"></head><body><p>Now this is a real detective story. In fact, the detective is essentially the main character. Dana Andrews plays Lieutenant Mark McPherson, homicide detective. He's investigating the death of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). There are two primary suspects, her old friend Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) and her fiance Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price).<br /><br />So Waldo and Shelby tag along behind Lieutenant McPherson as he carries out his investigation. There's a lovely big portrait of Laura in her apartment, and it soon becomes clear to Waldo that Mark McPherson is falling in love with her. That would be tragic, except that she is not dead. She spent a long week-end in her cabin in the mountains, trying to decide whether she really wanted to marry Shelby or not. She creates quite a stir when she shows up alive while Mark is reading her letters and her journal.<br /><br />Things get complicated in a big hurry when it turns out the woman blasted with a shotgun was not Laura but a model by the name of Diane Redfern that worked in her advertising agency. She was in love with Shelby. And so was Ann Treadwell, Laura's wealthy aunt. In fact, Shelby was her boy toy.<br /><br />I'm trying not to give away too much of the story, since it is a detective story, after all. And the ending is so dramatic! Not as surprising as it might have been, but quite dramatic nonetheless.</p></body></html>

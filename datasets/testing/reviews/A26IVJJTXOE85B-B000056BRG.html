The characters were extremely well-developed, and their interactions were intensely emotional.<br /><br />Charlton Heston plays the title character, Judah Ben-Hur, a rich Jewish Prince living in Jerusalem. He's best friends with Messala (Stephen Boyd), who becomes the new governor and commander of the Roman Legion. Messala, tries to persuade Judah to thwart any Jewish uprisings in Judea and fearing that he is a conspirator toward Rome, he sends Ben-Hur to a slave ship where he is forced to row with the slaves and imprisons his mother (Martha Scott) and sister (Cathy O'Donnell . After enduring years of pain and punishment, Ben is freed by Roman General Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) for saving his life at sea, becomes his chariot racer and surrogate son, and is later freed to do what he will. Ben tracks down Messala and threatens to beat the crap out of him if he doesn't release his family and if they're dead, then he's as good as gone also.<br /><br />His girlfriend finds out that his mom and sister have the plague, lies to Judah and tells him that they're dead so Judah becomes enraged and does the only thing an angry man can do: he destroys his friend- turned arch foe in the grand Chariot Race.<br /><br />Stephen Boyd's black-hearted Messala made for an interesting character and Jack Hawkins was brilliant as Judah's slave master turned savior.<br /><br />This movie won the awards for Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), Art-Direction, Cinematography, Costume Design, Special Effects, Editing, Score, and Sound. It only lost the award for Best Adapted Screenplay.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sneak peak at "The Bourne Supremacy" DVD"></head><body><p>The second film in a series makes or breaks a potential franchise. If the second Bond film had done poorly there's no doubt that that would have been the end. The same for the "Star Trek" film series (featuring either the original stars or "The Next Generation"). So the industry paid close attention to "The Bourne Supremacy". Had Matt Damon metamorphosed into an action star or was the first film just a fluke? "The Bourne Supremacy" proved that Damon and the potential of this film series passed the litmus test. Taking up where the first film ended, Bourne (Matt Damon) is framed for a CIA assassination forcing him to go on the run. He and Marie (Franka Potente) must pull up stakes in the sleepy seaside town where they've begun to make a life together. Bourne retaliates against the agents he used to call friends when he was an assassin in an intricate game of cat and mouse comparable to the first film. A warning about the film if you have a weak stomach is that much of this was shot using handheld cameras and creates the impression of a wild amusement ride during the action sequences. You may want to have your motion sickness pills close at hand.<br /><br /> Avoiding the spooky look of traditional cloak and dagger films, "The Bourne Supremacy" has the more modern jittery look of films like "Die Hard". The colors weren't vibrant in the original film but fairly subdued most of the time and they are well reproduced here with a sharp, clear and clean picture full of solid blacks. There's a touch of edge enhancement during a couple of sequences but it's kept to a minimum and is, for the most part, fairly subtle. The booming sound of the production receives a lively transfer using the surround speakers for maximum effect. One advantage of an action-thriller is that things are always faster, louder and over dramatic and those very qualities come alive in the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound mix.<br /><br />Like the original film (and its recent double dip DVD re-release), "The Bourne Supremacy" makes the most of the DVD format with some stunning examples in the way of extras. While the featurettes could have been combined into one larger documentary, the Special Features Producer evidently felt that the audience for this film had untreated ADHD as the longest featurette runs about 7 minutes. With nine featurettes included on the making of the film, fans will get an exhaustive glimpse behind the curtain at how the various effects were achieved for the film. Beginning with "Casting" we hear from director Greengrass about the challenges of selecting a strong personality and powerful actor to hold his or her own with actors like Brian Cox on screen. "Keeping It Real", "Blowing Things Up" and "On the Move with Jason Bourne" focus on everything from the location shooting in Moscow, the various physical effects employed on the set to create the spectacular action sequences and how the crew made it seem as if Matt Damon was doing all the driving in the riveting chase sequences. Damon also discusses some of the stunt driving training that he underwent for the sequences where he was behind the wheel. While he wasn't alone (I don't want to spoil it for you), it clearly gave him the confidence as an actor to believe he was driving the vehicle while in character.<br /><br />There's also a discussion of how some of the more complex camera moves were achieved during the shooting of the film. "The Go-Mobile Revs up the Action" discusses the device they used to achieve the look of Damon driving and allowed some of the dangerous driving stunts appear even more dangerous on film. Featuring both producer Frank Marshall and Matt Damon, this sequence breaks down how these sequences were broken up so that the most amazing shots could be done with Damon actually in the action.  "Anatomy of a Scene" breaks down the sequence near the conclusion involving a bridge chase, a jump off the bridge and landing on a barge. The final featurette has composer John Powell discussing his approach to scoring the film. A warning on all of these featurettes-don't want them until you see the movie otherwise the entire film will be spoiled for you.<br /><br />Some of the deleted scenes add character moments for Brian Cox, Joan Allen, Matt Damon and other cast members but would have slowed down the film. While they are importantly sequences (and are of the type that will probably be incorporated into a "Director's Cut" ten years down the line) for the characters, they don't add anything to the story itself and slow down the overall momentum of the film.<br /><br />A strong sequel to the first film, "The Bourne Supremacy" can stand on its own as a strong extension of the original thriller. The image quality is quite good. Keep in mind the washed out quality of the images and the slightly greenish tinge in many of the interior sequences was intended. With a nine featurettes that combined run about 46 minutes, the reality is that all nine featurettes could have easily been integrated into a single documentary on the making of the film. With scene access you would have gotten about the same results as the featurettes.  A fine film that may have you reaching for your armrest to hold on for a wild ride, "The Bourne Supremacy" will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p></body></html>

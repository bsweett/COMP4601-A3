The whole visual style is excellent until we get to the "pitch black" section of the film, than it starts to look a little more like the same old sci-fi/horror stuff.  I belive in one sense the movie is just to show off how cool the character, Riddick, can be played by Vin Diesel, but on the other hand it is a good sci-fi movie on its own.  One thing that's a little unfortunate is the fact that we are left with so little characters in such a short time (Resident Evil, AvP).  We dont' really get to know anyone except the 4 or 5 main characters, too bad.  Although yes, it can be somewhat derivative and plot stealing in a sense, it must be watched in conjunction with the short, Dark Fury, and Chronicles.  I do recommend it to any sci-fi/horror or Vin Diesel fans, you won't be let down, I think.</p></body></html>

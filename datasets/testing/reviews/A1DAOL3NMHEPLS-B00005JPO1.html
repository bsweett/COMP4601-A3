Bad dialog, lots of pseudo-science, over-the-top acting -- "Crystal Skull" has it all. The CGI special effects are often impressive, but fail to make up for a weak, choppy story line and unbelievable action sequences. As just one small example of how implausible the action gets, the main characters often toss around the titular crystal skull as if it were a football, when a quartz object that size would weigh about 70 pounds! And then there are giant ants, gunpowder that is attracted to magnets, and a whole slew of other improbabilities. And the "happy ending" where Indy and Marion get [*******] is just too corny and contrived.<br /><br />I really wish they hadn't made this movie, as it cheapens the reputation of a great 1980s action trilogy. Just one more example of Hollywood sacrificing art for cash.</p></body></html>

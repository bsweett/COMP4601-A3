<meta name="summary" content="FOUR STARS FOR WHAT IT SETS OUT TO DO"></head><body><p>This energetic, fast paced remake does not waste any time with tedious character development.  It cuts to the action and never lets up.<br /><br />Here's state of the art filmmakling by a pro director who know exactly what he's doing.  Great sets and claustrophobic sequences with flooding and fire and falling objects look real.<br /><br />Yes, it's all over the top stuff but this is what popcorn movies are all about.  I liked this one a lot better than the ridiculous M:I:III.  No one going into this movie should be surprised at the premise or plot, that's not the point.  The idea is seeing a high tech remake of something with which we are already familiar.  And on that basis, this movie delivers.  This is not an art film.  So the bashing by other reviewers is uncalled for.</p></body></html>

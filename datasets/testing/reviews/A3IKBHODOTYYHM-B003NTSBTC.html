Scorsese does a superb job of creating an unsettling, Gothic mood, with a music score that adds tension and effective, creepy imagery of the island. There's a deliberate slow moving pace to the film, but I think this works well to build tension and lead up to the dramatic conclusion. Some may guess the ending, or at least have clues where it is heading before it reaches the film's final minutes, but, nonetheless Shutter Island is a great film, a successful, stellar adaptation of the novel. The cast particularly shines, especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who turns in an excellent performance, giving depth to his role as Teddy Daniels. Ben Kingsley also does a superb job as the institution's Dr. Cawley.<br /><br />Teddy Daniels arrives to Shutter Island with his partner to unravel the mysterious disappearance of one of its patients, Rachel Solando. As Teddy and Chuck explore the institution, and find out about Rachel and its inmates. However, Teddy learns more about the mystery and the institution, flashbacks and visions begin to surface that further complicate the plot.<br />Shutter Island begins with one mystery only to add on another mystery that needs to be accounted for. There are several layers of twists, but these are revealed in fragmented pieces that we put together.<br /><br />As far as editions to the film, I'd stick with the blu-ray over this edition, as the blu-ray has two featurettes about the film: Behind the Shutters and Into the Lighthouse. The quality is a bit sharper as well.<br /><br />Over all, Shutter Island is quite an effective, atmospheric experience and, as one reviewer noted, a film that you can view multiple time to pick up clues and meanings. Creepy and weird, but in a good way. Definitely one of Scorsese's best.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars</p></body></html>

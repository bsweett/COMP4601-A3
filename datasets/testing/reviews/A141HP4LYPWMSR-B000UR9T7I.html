<meta name="summary" content=""Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man" ~ Amplifying The Darkness Within And Without"></head><body><p>The third and most likely the last of the Spider-Man saga starring Tobey Maguire came to an end with the '07 release of `Spider-Man 3'.This film didn't live up to the expectations of Spidey fans for several reasons, the one most often mentioned is the numerous bad guys muddied the plot and eliminated and opportunity to further explore the psyche of the man behind the mask.<br /><br />A further annoyance to his fan base was that the plot itself was designed to expose and amplify the darkside of Peter Parker's personality which was a dangerous risk for the filmmakers to take since it deprived the audience of the shy, nerdish persona that everyone loved and could relate to.<br /><br />To be honest I hated this film upon my first viewing and couldn't wait for it to end. However after taking a second look at it with new eyes I discovered that it was actually quite good, just different. Admittedly not as good as the first two but still worth a watch or two.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Thing (1982)"></head><body><p>The Thing(1982-I am not sure I have seen the original) is a good suspenseful yet disgusting and gory (overdone) movie. It's Horror with Sci Fi and limbs ripped off, heads moving,dogs mutating. it creeped the hell out of me growing up and then seeing it again. I guess 82' was a good year!(I was born ;)  )</p></body></html>

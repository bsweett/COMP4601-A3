Steve Martin is amazing as the hapless Monsieur Clouseau, he really should have gotten some kind of award for this stupendous work that he does in the movie. Personally I think he does a better job then Peter Sellers. Steve Martins awful English accent is just about right and he acts the part to perfection. Some of the scenes are instant classic like the farting in the sound proof room and many others. Personally I find this version allot more fun then Peter Sellers then again I am a huge fan of Steve Martin and I consider him to be comedic genius well in league with other greats such as Eddie Murphy and Bill Murray to mention a few. The music is right on the mark. The script is very well written and the dialogue is perfect for this awesome remake. Highly recommended indeed. This is not a movie to missed.</p></body></html>

The movie just lives inside those astonished 90 minutes of horror between one moment and the next one.<br /><br />The film takes place in virtual real time, cutting among the events on-board United Flight 93, which was the only plane of the four hijacked that morning not to reach its target, and the escalating confusion on the ground. As much as 9/11 was a worldwide televised event, Greengrass manages to evoke new horrors by taking us inside the confusion, showing us how the scenario was slowly put together by those who were in a position to do something about it.<br /><br />There is a masochistic quality to watching the film, as we enter the theater knowing fully well aware of the horrors we are about to witness. For we all know, or think we know, how the story of United 93 comes out.<br /><br />But what happens at the end of the story? Greengrass evidently disagrees with Bush's implications that the passengers committed an act of self-immolation. In the director's vision, the passengers have a naive idea of using a passenger, a trained pilot, to bring the plane down to the ground. But it's clear that Greengrass's refuses to confirm that without the passengers' action they would have hit the Capitol. On the contrary, his script shows the terrorists making a miscalculation of their own.<br /><br />The film develops slowly, beginning in the early morning hours as the four hijackers prepare themselves for what they feel it's their duty. We get images of Newark airport, the passengers, unaware that they future does not behold a happy ending. The air traffic controllers, several of whom are portrayed by their real-life counterparts, are going about their everyday business until the horror shows in their screens.<br /><br />From there, the film escalates as we know it did, until Greengrass finally abandons the world on the ground and concentrates the film's final moments entirely on the plane. It is here that Greengrass's amazing restraint and respect shows up, as he presents the victims as a group of terrified people facing a certain death making a desperate decision to change their own fate. There are no goofy-corny subplots and made up characters. There is no sense of heroism or national duty, but rather the jittery, horrifying sense of seeing your own death approaching. It's hard, it's sad and overwhelming, but still, it's something that we should see, so we never forget the horrors those innocent human beings were exposed without any justification.</p></body></html>

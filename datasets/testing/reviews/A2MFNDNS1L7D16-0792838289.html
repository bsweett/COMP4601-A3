Taken from a novel by Richard Condon, Frank Sinatra wanted to turn it into a movie before he was even approached by the director, John Frankenheimer. "One Take" Sinatra is in his prime. This is his best performance. He had the choice of playing the psychologically damaged, Major Bennett Marco,  or, his sergeant during the Korean War, Raymond Shaw the thoughly "brain-washed & dry cleaned" protagonist. Sinatra's choice to play Marco turned out to be a good one. Lawerence Harvey assumed an American accent & played Shaw to perfection.<br />  Plenty of excellence in acting to go around. I've never seen Angela Lansbury better as the cruel, manipulative, amoral mother of Shaw, Mrs. Iselin. She is the wife of drunk, weak, easily led Senator John Iselin, played by James Gregory in a right on impersonation of you know who. Janet Leigh, John McGiver & Leslie Parrish all give fine supporting performances.<br />  Sometimes you get an all-star cast with everyone at the top of their game. This movie is such a confluence.<br />  The DVD also has a commentary version by Frankenheimer & an interview with Sinatra about the movie.</p></body></html>

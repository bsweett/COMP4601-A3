<meta name="summary" content="AND CHRISTMAS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME!"></head><body><p>Few films can stand to be seen as many times as 'A Christmas Story'. If you grew up in the 50's or 60's this film will really bring back memories of being a kid at Christmas time, but anyone should be able to relate to this film. I avoided this film for a few years because TNT played this film continually for 24 hours every Christmas. I finally was ready for a viewing and what better day to do it?<br /><br />The film is a timeless classic brimming with the excitement of the holiday. The narrative only enhances the dialogue going on in our own minds. This was Christmas in a simpler time, when the emphasis wasn't on over spending, but the thought of family and that one special item for Christmas morning could make all the difference.<br /><br />The two disc set is very nice with full and widescreen versions of the film included, There is also a fair amount of extras including commentary, trivia game, "making of" feature-ette with on screen comments by the director, Billingsley and three other child actors from the film. There are spots on Daisy rifles and the famous leg lamp and a few other interesting tidbits to toggle through. While most of the extras are fun, none of them are essential or give any real insight on this excellent low budget film. I would have loved more depth in the making of feature-ette and not just the actors remarking on how much they liked making the film. The DVD transfer looks really good and if you don't have this in your collection, you should.<br /><br />Merry Christmas everyone, from yours truly Dr Shock!</p></body></html>

But I truly wonder why NOBODY has remarked on the similarity of the two films, Avatar and District 9. Not quite the same script, but mighty close: an alien species is unable to defend itself, for the time being, from Blackwater-style mercenary gunners until one Homo sapiens comes to their aid. In both films, the rescuer is a cross-breed, in Avatar by intent, in District 9 by accident. Both films end up with the half-human and the aliens blasting the baddies (us) to kingdom come. And both films have a profoundly subversive anti-capitalist message. And both films depict humans as unredeemably bloodthirsty racists. Avatar has the edge in pretty scenery and 3-D, but District 9 includes ACTING! A scruffy-looking unknown, Sharlto Copley, plays the role of the DNA-infected 'traitor' to human national and corporate greed; if Copley doesn't win some kind of Oscar for this performance, there's no justice on Earth.<br /><br />By this time, I think it's safe to presume that everybody has seen both films, so I won't offer a synopsis, nor a teaser nor a spoiler. Instead, I want to outrage the usual outragees by speculating on the current mood of apocalyptic fantasy among us H-saps. There are several channels, obviously, one of extraterrestrial encounter, one of global catastrophe (that total snoozer about instant climate change comes to mind), and the third about a Day of Judgement scenario. 2012? I haven't seen it, but it must fit one of these categories. The "Left Behind" novels. What's up, humanity? Are we so desperately fearful of our finite and fleeting existence that we need to bolster our self-image with fantasies of Armageddon? Relax, you silly primates! If there's anyone -- or Anyone -- out there, He, She or They are not preoccupied with us.<br /><br />Is this really a five-star film? Beyond the acting of Copley and the special effects, no way! It's 'kinda dopey' as we say in Minnesota. There are more logical inconsistencies in the script than in a speech by Sarah Palin. And there is a grievous problem with the depiction of the Nigerians in the film; they are stereotyped in the most racist, neo-colonial manner. Somebody ought to be ashamed.<br /><br />But you have to see it, believe me, before the sequel comes out, when the aliens come back. Unless, of course, you think you can take their side ...</p></body></html>

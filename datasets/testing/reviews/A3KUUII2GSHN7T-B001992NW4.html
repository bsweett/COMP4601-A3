<meta name="summary" content="Good Christian heed my warning, this film will eat at you..."></head><body><p>Why? It fulfills its goal as providing perhaps the most dreadful film of all time (emphasis on the word dreadful). There are no salvageable or redeeming qualities about this film.  All you will feel is utter dread, completely and in the most certain of ways. In that way, the film accomplishes its duty, providing, without question, one of the most hellish feelings in movie history. God's men do not prove more powerful in this tale and the film depicts the awesome idea of the sheer magnitude and might that the devil has at his disposure.  <p>We see a gentle child, a girl no less, being possessed by sheer evil.  Take note, this is not just a murderous type of evil; it is a combination of evils: perversion, anti-God vulgarities, and so on.  When you are done with this film, you will question your own faith and decide if you yourself are suitable to take on such a monsterous force like a demon - even if you are a good Christian. <p>Proceed with extreme caution, this film will provoke you to dread and make you question your faith and your own view on the spiritual world. It gets an A+ for invoking those fears.</p></body></html>

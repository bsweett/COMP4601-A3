<meta name="summary" content="The quintessential werewolf movie and the best of its kind."></head><body><p>John Landis's "An American Werewolf in London" is without a doubt the best werewolf movie ever made. Basically, the plot features David Kesseler and his friend Jack Goodman in England on a trip.  While on the moors, they are attacked by a werewolf rendering Jack dead and Kesseler badly wounded.  Hence, Jack survived the attack and becomes a werewolf where he is taken to a London hospital.  Slowly but surely, Kesseler feels the transformation from a human being into a creature of the night, all of which provides great entertainment for any horror movie audience.<br /><br />The special effects in this movie are second to none...in fact, the scene where David Kesseler actually transforms into a werewolf is so real looking that it actually hurts the viewer just to watch.  Of course, the always funny but undead "Jack" is also brilliantly done in his undead form as he appears numerous times with his neck torn out and his body continues to deteriorate throughout the movie.<br /><br />Even the dreams of David Kesseler are absolutely horrifying and so well done that the creatures in these dreams, upon a first viewing, appear to the audience like this action is actually taking place in the movie and not just in Kesseler's mind.  One of my personal favorite scenes is the dream where Kesseler is in the bed in the woods when Nurse Alex visits David and he turns around with an absolutely harrowing monster face that will scare the pants off of just about anyone.  These dreams provide a logical transformation process of David into a werewolf that the audience can actually intellectually grasp and appreciate, which makes this movie that much more effective as a horror movie.  The acting in this movie is outstanding as is the directing and production values.<br /><br />The inserted dark comedy, e.g. Jack in "undead" form and the silly cop, in "An American Werewolf in London" actually meshes quite well with the horror in this movie which is quite rare for horror movies.  Nevertheless, "An American Werewolf in London" actually pulls this dark comedy-horror flick off quite well where other horror movies that have tried the same tactic have failed miserably i.e. the comedy actually neutralizes the horror in these second rate flicks relegating the flick to "joke status".<br /><br />The only real cricism I can come up with "An American Werewolf in London" is actually one of its charms/strengths that make it a great movie.  That being said, however, from a "TRUE" and unadulterated horror critic's perspective focusing on the aspect of fear evoked in an audience, the dark comedy actually provides comic relief to said audience where if left out, the audience would be left confronted with this pure and unadulterated horror this movie clearly evokes in any sophisticated horror movie audience...however, if the dark comedy is omitted, one is left to ponder whether the movie would work as well in a general kind of way without this advent of dark comedy.<br /><br />While I do not think that "An American Werewolf in London" is one of the greatest horror movies of alltime, I do believe it to be a great horror movie and is without a doubt the best werewolf movie of all time and is certainly a must own for any true horror movie fan.</p></body></html>

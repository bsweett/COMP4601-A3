<meta name="summary" content="Remake by stealth"></head><body><p>Clearly, what the director is trying to do is make a superman for a new generation of kids by stealth. The actors are made younger than what they would have been if the film had continued from the 1970s version. What is over 40 years in this movie is a five years.<br /><br />It has very good filming something I expected; the special effects are good. The problem is nothing is particularly original here.<br /><br />The story itself is as weak as the first one but at least that was original. It gets close at times to being almost the same story. The script for an adult, I do not think is particularly good. None of the characters were interesting.<br /><br />The acting is average.<br /><br />I would class it as a remake by stealth made for a new generation.</p></body></html>

Bourne, the supposed rogue agent that, because of his robotic training as a government killer has amnesia and is rtying hard to hide in the hiterlands of a small beach village in India no less. Well, like his old CIA handlers have said when you are a rogue killer, even with amnesia, there's nowhere in the world you can really hide, sooner or later they'll find you.....<br /><br />And so they do, but instead of killing Bourne they kill his girlfriend forcing Bourne to face his demons and try to backtrack his amnesia plagued memory to find who is trying to get him killed.<br /><br />The movie is an action flick with a capital 'A' as we move from India to Italy, Germany and then Russia.  It's one of the better easy going entertaining films around today ....</p></body></html>

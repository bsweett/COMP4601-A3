<meta name="summary" content="A Town Where Everyone Knows your Na-ahhhhhh!!!!"></head><body><p>You've just gotten in and a package arrives - opening it you find it has a lovely in-lay that stands about two feet tall and is normally accustomed to sitting on the knees of "performers" while doing the "Mary and Billy" act. When you see it your wife decides to start a little jingle about a woman who "had no children, only dolls" and rhymes down a little more to a climax of "pulling your tongue out if you scream." So, what to do, what to do? Well, keep it, of course, and allow it to ruin your life. Apparently that is the way of things when you come from a town where death seems second nature, and more so when you come from a town that suffers from the plague of a death woman's curse that deals with little people made of wood, 101 to be exact, and a mystery within a mystery that evolves as you go home. Adding to that is the death of your wife, apparently she didn't heed her won jingle, and is had a facelift of the Jokeresque caliber.<br /><br />While Dead Silence has had some starkly bad press, I thought it was entertaining and had some really creepy parts in it. There's something about a little doll with eyes that match up with a taxidermist's little plaything that I find bothersome, not to mention the background on the "why" in this cursed lil town. Apparently the tongue jingle - everyone seems to know it and some really seem to know it, to the point that it says a lot about the kind of force that's being dealt with. Its kind of like Cheers, where everyone knows your name, only you don't scream out "Norm" because you get your tongue removed from your mouth.<br />Personally it also sounds like a chance to pack up my bags and take a one-way trip back to "anywhere but here"ville, but in solving the death of one's beloved many things become irrational - despite the nasty pictures.<br />And the pictures; they are nasty.<br /><br />Personally, I liked the elements, the story, the acting, and even the way that this wasn't a newer edition of bad elements but more of an edition selected out of older nightmares I used to have when I was a kid. It reminded me of the Twilight Zone meets Stuart Gordon meets a field full of blood and Gene Simmon's like tongue-appeal, with nice elements of CGI to piece in some of the puzzles and nice pieces of a rather creepy woman and some rather creepy little friends edging the terror along. It didn't have a lot of what people seem to want from the horror genre these days - it was a little different and different seems to equate to boring some how. Still, I judge my movies on a old scale I developed back when Italian movies walked upright like the T-Rex's of the land and when forces like Evil Dead and Night of the Living Dead were panned by critics because they didn't deliver on the canned goods. I watch the movie and my wife watches it close by, and the more she jumps and the more I become ensnared in the plot the more I like it. Critics be burned as witches - they don't give out awards to horror in the mainstream so why should horror kowtow to them?<br />And I liked it because people were always screaming - apparently Mary doesn't care if you scream because you fall down a flight of stairs or because you had some results on Jenny as long as you show those pearly white and that little apparatus hinged inside your mouth.<br /><br />I know the "makers of Saw" got many people up in arms when they watched the movie, too, and I know that people didn't expect what they saw. Still, it was what I expected from the beginning and the jingle - it was funny and it played well. Here we had a horror movie with a vengeful attitude that started with the beginning and then played out its pieces as the movie went along.<br />So, judging from the different sides of the same reviewing coin, it might be something to decide what you want to see and then weigh your options. This movie was a throw-back, a screamer flick with flinncher qualities, and it was also something that didn't involve the depraved games like "Saw" would have offered.<br />No - having your tongue removed because you scream, that's not enough.<br /><br />Dropping your expectations when you wathc horror helps, and this is a good chance to try that because it is a movie where a dead woman puppeteers dolls JUST to get a chance at the one prize she's been after - the fish that sawm upstream. So, you have a classic revenge case, a horrible butcher that has reworked the whole town, a facelift gone wrong, terribly police work, the Perfect Doll, and a range of other dolls that make me feel uncomfortable when I think about them.<br />I really enjoyed the film, not expecting much and getting a lot more in the process.</p></body></html>

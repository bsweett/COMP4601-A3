And why are they all rabid Atkins Diet freaks?<br /><br />Zach Snyder's brilliant 2004 remake of George Romero's groundbreaking "Dawn of the Dead" takes up the material of the original, dusts it off, injects it with a syringe chock-full of creepiness, splatter, gore, and raw adrenaline, and goes off-roading into the dark desert of the Apocalypse.<br /><br />This is better than Romero's original. It is terrifying. It makes your jaw drop. It is, possibly, the only cinematic rendering of the Apocalypse I have ever found even remotely believable, and let me tell ya, fellow troopers---every second I was riding shotgun with Sarah Polley's heroine. And given what I saw---flesh-eating monsters tearing up law-abiding home-owners in living color on their front lawns---I had a really itchy trigger finger.<br /><br />"Dawn of the Dead 2004" made me afraid. Very afraid.<br /><br />Let me make this clear: this is the scariest film I have ever seen. Your heart will race. Your blood pressure will rise. Look at the opening credits alone, that grim parade of brutal bloody images of atrocity accompaniesd by Johnny Cash's dismal and revelatory "The Man Comes Around". Yeh, this is the real thing, Old Hoss. Lock and load, yeah; but don't hide. They'll find you and eat you if you hide.<br /><br />In an amazing debut for a novice director, Zack Snyder shoves us mercilessly from the sublime (even boring) into the ridiculous. No, not ridiculous: he shoves us from the everyday commonplace world of adorable skating little girls and 24-hour supermarkets and fast-food and pizza delivery into a latter-day hellscape where your next door neighbor busts down your door in the wee hours of the morning and uses your brainpan as a sausage sampler.<br /><br />I expected nothing when I walked into "Dawn of the Dead", other than 90+ minutes of gut-chewing escapism. Within the first 5 minutes of Snyder's masterwork, I was hooked: my eyes bugged out, my heart pounding.<br /><br />Feel the fear when Ana's (played by the gorgeous, gracious, calm as a bomb Sarah Polley) car smashes into a tree after her narrow escape from being breakfast in her own home. Seriously. Put yourself there. Snyder captures the sort of raw danger only a select few of us feel once in a lifetime, and then only in street riots or war zones.<br /><br />How does Snyder compare to Romero's classic? He takes all that material, pillages Romero's brain cells, and surpasses anything the Old Master accomplished in any of his "Dead Trilogy".<br /><br />Snyder's 2004 "Dawn of the Dead" is a nihilistic classic of gut-chewing horror, and blew me away in its total rebel yell against decency. We get ample flesh chewing. We get a hideously fat old woman in a ridiculously skimpy negligee (who has, mind you, been hauled into the mall where our heroes take refuge---hauled into the mall in a WHEELBARROW) hankering for flesh and demonstrating all the right moves.<br /><br />We get a stone-cold gang-banger Andre (played to the 9MM by the talented Mekhi Phifer) who thinks he got to live in this world to bring his baby into it---and cruelly, nastily, gets his wish.<br /><br />There isn't a single character who lets the flick down: Polley goes from normalcy to hellscape with soldierly resolve. Ving Rhames (Officer Kenneth) dominates the shattered landscape and totally owns the movie. Ty Burrell (yachtsman and resident cynic Steve) and Michael Kelly (security guard turned Mall Hitler CJ) provide a generous helping of humanity at its worst.<br /><br />But let's focus, for a moment, on the true bloody glory of this remake that actually manages to surpass the original: doesn't it feel like Death to you? The Death of Humanity? The Death of Normalcy? The death of going down to the Mall to pick up a CD or videogame and then heading back home to the burbs for a little sleep?<br /><br />The DVD is locked and loaded, too: my personal faves are gunshop owner Andy's video diary and "We Interrupt this Program", part compilation of the slice-and-diced news broadcasts sampled in the movie, part ambitious little indie-film. It's a bit rough around the edges, but taken on its own terms adds depth to the Last Days.<br /><br />Snyder has turned out a classic little flick that goes well beyond the frontiers of the typical flesh-eater outing, and ventures far into the dark territory of the Apocalypse. Golf clubs, the mall rooftop, Richard Cheese's swing rendition of Disturbed's "Down with the Sickness", and some of the sickest, droolingest, flesh-rottingest zombie nutjobs I have ever seen in my life, and you have an open doorway to Hell that is, for now, entitled "Dawn of the Dead 2004".<br /><br />Lock and load and watch the first step---it's a doozy.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

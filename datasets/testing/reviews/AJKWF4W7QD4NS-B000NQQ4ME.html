<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>No matter what you may think of Mel Gibson, you have to admit that the man knows how to get your attention, and Apocalypto is sheer proof of that.  Mainly revolving around Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the film centers around the declining Mayan culture, desperate to survive by offering frequent human sacrifices after raiding and pillaging near by villages.  Desperate to be re-united with his pregant wife and young son, Jaguar Paw escapes, and seeks bloody revenge on his pursuers.  What helps make Apocalypto so surprisingly good is the sense of dread that Gibson manages to create, as well as the surprising amount of action set pieces as well.  Seriously, Apocalypto features enough bloody action that you may think you've stumbled across John Rambo in some scenes, but this helps make the film's 138 minute running time breeze by.  Not to mention how startlingly poignant the film becomes as well before degrading into a cat and mouse chase through the jungle.  Regardless of what you may think of Mel Gibson, you've got to admit that he knows how to hold your interest, and that is one of the many things that Apocalypto manages to do, whether you want that or not.  All in all, Apocalypto definitely isn't for the faint of heart, but it's definitely one of the better films to come from a big name like Gibson in a while.</p></body></html>

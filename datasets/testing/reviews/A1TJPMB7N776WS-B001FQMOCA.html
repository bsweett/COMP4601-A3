<meta name="summary" content="It's because you're mine......."></head><body><p>Movie biopics are generally problematic: how do you get all or a major portion of a person's life on the screen in more or less than 2 hours? How do you do justice to anyone's life in 120 minutes?<br />There have been good examples of course, but most of them have been good because the writer or director has wisely chosen to telescope/hone in on a relatively short portion of a subject's life: Billie Holiday's in "Lady Sings the Blues" or Truman Capote's in "Capote." Both films, I realize with wildly different results, but both equally effective because the focus of each has been telescoped and better stated...microscoped onto a short portion of each life: both Truman Capote and Billie Holiday have been revealed and analyzed and effectively appreciated through the learned and discretionary eye of someone who effectively separates the legend from the reality.<br />Director James Mangold (the quirky "Heavy" and the effective "The Yards") would not seem a logical choice to direct a probing film about Johnny Cash (an audaciously effective Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter ( a wonderful Reese Witherspoon) but he does manage most of the time to steer away from the maudlin and melodramatic and in the process comes up with a good, straight-forward biopic of the two.<br />The obvious comparison to "Walk The Line" would be the recent "Ray" but whereas Jamie Foxx's recreation of Ray Charles borders on caricature and mimicry, Phoenix's Cash always seems and feels organic: he doesn't so much as inhabit Cash's spirit and persona as interpret it. Phoenix not only uses his own voice to sing the songs...he uses his own psychic voice to creep inside of Cash to reveal the Cash inside of Phoenix and the Phoenix inside of Cash and this translates into a thrilling, revealing portrait of the two.<br />Witherspoon also does her own singing and because we know a lot less of Carter's life, manufactures and makes real a character that is both simple and straightforward as well as one who, though she loves and admires her talented and famous family, longs for her own place in the world in general and in the entertainment world specifically: she is less wounded than Cash but equally on the lookout for personal and professional validation.<br />"Walk The Line" is not the best movie ever made but it certainly is not the worst. The best biopics require strong, incandescent performances at their core and "WTL"has that in spades with Phoenix and Witherspoon's revolutionary recreations/interpretations of Cash and Carter.<br />Enter the world of "Walk The Line" with an open mind and heart and you will be rewarded with both a noble and novel interpretation of two lives and two people who dared to be talented and blessed in a world that often attempted to stamp out and diffuse those that were different in favor of mediocrity.</p></body></html>

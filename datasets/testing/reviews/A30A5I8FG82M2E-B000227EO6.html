We all know the song, just like we all know the Kill Bill saga is one long violent, bloody, amoral MESS.  I promised myself and my Lord that I would not watch volume 2, but my friend's daughters assured me that the second half was far superior.<br /><br />Friends and fans (of my reviews! Unite!), let me tell you this movie is even more violent and disturbing than the first one.  I'm glad I ate light before watching, because I surely would've tossed my cookies in a literal sense when watching a woman trapped underground in a coffin!  Yeah, it's that bad.<br /><br />This movie sets the feminist movement (which I'm part of, and proud of it) backwards about 15-20 years.  Uma Thurman has been celebrated for becoming a walking skeleton.  Sure, she mastered a rare form of ninjitsu while preparing for a physically demanding role.  But it doesn't make her a "role-model," just ask Mary-Kate Olsen.</p></body></html>

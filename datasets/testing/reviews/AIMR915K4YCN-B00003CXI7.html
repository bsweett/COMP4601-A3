Nope. Strange occurances begin almost immediately, causing Claire to grow increasingly terrified and suspicious. Are simple oddities (a door that opens itself, pictures jumping off tables, etc.) escalating into full-blown supernatural events, or is Claire just losing her mind? The tension builds slowly, while the mystery becomes more intriguing. Is there a ghost about? If so, what does this frightening spectre want? What is it trying to tell Claire? Norman believes that Claire is cracking up, until dark secrets are revealed that leave no doubt as to the mission of the relentless spirit. Ford and Pheiffer are great together, coming off as a married couple w/ lots of history. WHAT LIES BENEATH is suspenseful, eerie, and packed w/ surprises. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

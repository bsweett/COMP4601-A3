Stone cut nearly 20 minutes from the theatrical release and added about ten minutes of unseen footage.  Hundreds of additional edits dramatically reshaped dozens of sequences.  In addition, he removed a significant and controversial homo-erotic love scene between Alexander (Colin Farrell) and his male lover. What was originally mocked as "Alexander the Gay" is now less so.<br /><br />Compared to the theatrical release, Stone's "Director's Cut" is a misnomer.  After all, the first release was also his cut.  However, this DVD is a different film; better because it is more accessible.  The action has been beefed up and the once confusing narrative is easier to follow.  And the already magnificent score by Vangelis seems somehow more effective on this new cut.<br /><br />Stone is a bold, inventive, visionary director who takes chances with controversial material.  However, his attempt to get under the skin (no pun intended) and create a psychological and emotional portrait of this extraordinary historical figure who conquered the known world by the age of 33 over two millennia ago has not been fully realized.<br /><br />But make no mistake, in the midst of awesome images of breathtaking scope, savage violence, and revealing intimacy there are also unexpected moments of insight into a puzzling, complex and paradoxical character.  I'm referring to both Alexander and Stone himself.<br /><br />Stone's dense commentary on this cut is way above the norm, with tons of historical information as well as personal observations.  But the secret thing that drove Alexander -- and why the director's obsession with him -- are still a mystery.  The second disc's feature length documentary on the film's production by Sean Stone (Oliver's son) are nicely done, refreshingly raw and unpretentious.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe this is only a work-in-progress that will eventuall undergo more changes and, like a great artist painting over a flawed canvas, Stone will eventually reveal the masterpiece that lurks beneath the surface of what is probably the most expensive vanity production of all time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Remake Lacks Power Of Original...3.5 stars"></head><body><p>It seems these days that many directors are out to remake classic or older horror movies. We have seen THE FOG remade; we have seen DAWN OF THE DEAD remade; we are going to see WHEN A STRANGER CALLS and THE SENTINEL (although not confirmed) remade; but now, we have already bore witness to the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake. Does it live up to the chill of the original? Not quite, but it's still entertaining. R Lee Ermey is absolutely hilarious as the insane cop "family" member, and although there are some thrills, this remake cannot match the power of the original which shocked us back in 1974.<br /><br />There are some things different about the remake that should not have been changed at all. For instance, the five teens traveling in the van run into a girl who is wandering the road, and not looking too well. In the original, Edwin Neal was much better as the crazed guy who likes "head cheese". The girl in this one just seemed to underplay her role, and she wasn't very convincing, but she was very much traumatized by something. After she blows her brains out, they ditch the pot they have in a horse pinata and, eventually, the girl after the crazy "sheriff" comes to get rid of the body. They go to an abandoned mill and find a young boy, Jebediah, and the two leads, Jessica Biel and Eric Balfour (who are competent in their roles), proceed to the house of hell. The father in this movie, instead of being dead, was alive and legless in a wheel chair. The first kill of the movie wasn't as powerful as in the original. Where in the original the guy ran to the door and Leatherface appeared and clocked him in the head, in this one Leatherface (played well by Andrew Bryniarski) clocks the guy after he goes into the living room where we see cartoons playing on the television. That to me just says "straight-ahead" horror film, not powerful shocker. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but if you're going to remake a film (which you're almost doomed for bad reviews), you better be damn close to the original.<br /><br />The rest of the movie plays as a straight-ahead slasher, with Bryniarski playing the Leatherface role almost as good as Gunnar Hansen from the original. The way Leatherface is in this movie, his behavior and movements, are more funny than scary (but still creepy at times). In the original, they were funny but disturbing and scary. But some of the performances in this version are throw-aways, and some are good like R Lee Ermey's performance. It seemed like Jessica Biel, while handling her role well, was more in the movie for eye-candy than anything, but I can't discredit her believable performance. She nailed the girl of the original almost to a tee. The intro and the epilogue (narrated by John Laroquette) were actually good, and I liked the way they started and ended the film. Unfortunately, the fact that this was more a straight slasher film took away from the power of the original.<br /><br />Remakes are not going to be quite as good most of the time when you make them, and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE was no exception. While I still found this movie entertaining (yes, the platinum series 2-disc version currently sits in my collection), it cannot match the power of the original. While the running time was short and the pace of the movie was quick, the quality must match the quantity. And while not a failure by any means, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW remake can't be recommended as more than an enjoyable, straight-ahead slasher movie.</p></body></html>

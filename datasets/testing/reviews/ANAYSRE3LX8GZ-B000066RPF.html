And the 2 disc edition here is great, but i recomend you get a good price! The bonus features are packed into 2 discs but there not somthing you would watch over and over again! The movie is worth it mostly just for the classic film, and the people who have seen and loved the film will enjoy the bonus materials, espechelly the return to locations where it was filmed, and seeing what it looked like when they did the documentry in 2000 or whenever?</p></body></html>

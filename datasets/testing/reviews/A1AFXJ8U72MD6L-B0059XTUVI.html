<meta name="summary" content="MY GRADE: B minus to B."></head><body><p>A nicely delivered even if not fully engaging tale about the life of Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of Britain, which is mostly told through flashbacks in her old age as her memory begins to fail her. Meryl Streep, who played Thatcher, received Best Actress from the Academy Awards for this picture.<br /><br />About the only issue I had (and it's a big one) is that they tried to make it appear as if all of her victories didn't mean much in the end when they actually did. One could argue there was a liberal bias in this film that took a few opportunities to slam Thacher when they really weren't justified. Thatcher's children dubbed this film "a left-wing fantasy". Anybody who doesn't know what she did for Great Britain should educate themselves about the woman and no I'm not a conservative.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was $13M and it made over $114M at the Box Office.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; GOT THATCHER RIGHT: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: end of May 2012.</p></body></html>

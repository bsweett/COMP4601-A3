<meta name="summary" content="The Best One of the 3 Films..."></head><body><p>This one has been trashed by most fans, maybe marketing Venom who only has maybe 20 minutes screen time as a major villian was a bad idea here, I don't know, I fail to see where the overated "Spiderman 2" is considered the best one, this one to me is the best one because it pulls no punches, Tobey McGuire really gets to let loose with Peter's dark side here, which was fun, & Kirsten Dunst really looks her best here, she was pretty in the first two, but here, she really shines in her beauty, also, Bryce Dallas Howard is also nice to look at here & looks just like her comic book character, Topher Grace was the last guy I pictured as Venom, but I think he pulled it off in the end, he was really having fun with it no doubt, but I think what I really liked was how the characters developed more here, Harry as the new Goblin was a bit underused, but no doubt effective, however his teaming up with Spiderman in the end never happened in the comics, but there teaming up here was a nice change of pace, this ending was much better than the first two films ending, the building construction sequence with Mary Jane's fate hanging in the balance was a bit more intense & threatning that what we were given in the first two films, although I think they probably could have done without Sandman, still, he too was a fun villian, of the 3 films this is my favorite, J.K. Simmons once again chews up the scenery as Jonah Jameson, talk about having fun with a character, all in all, the best of the three in my view..</p></body></html>

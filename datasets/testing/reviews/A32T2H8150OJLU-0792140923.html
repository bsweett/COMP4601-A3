<meta name="summary" content="A movie OF our times, and FOR our times"></head><body><p>Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mentally challenged man who grows up in rural Alabama, and whose life spans many of the significant events of the latter half of the 20th century.<br /><br />Hanks plays the role to perfection as he tells his life story to strangers while sitting at a bus stop.<br /><br />You will be caught up in this story as Forrest Gump crosses paths with celebrities, meets presidents, plays college football, fights in Vietman, is swept up in anti-war rallies, and becomes a success.<br /><br />When all is said and done, all Forrest really wants is to find his very best friend in the world so that they can "be just like peas and carrots" again.<br /><br />Hanks plays the role convincingly.  Forrest has no guile, is completely trusting, and his childlike wonder and limitations make him an endearing and enduring character.<br /><br />Be advised that there are some scenes that may prove offensive to some viewers...there is a smattering of foul language, amd there are scenes portraying drug and alcohol abuse, as well as war violence, etc.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great show.  You will be glad you watched!<br /><br />A strong 4-star offering.</p></body></html>

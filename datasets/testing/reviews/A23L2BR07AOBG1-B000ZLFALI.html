It always feels jumbled and uninspired with a focus on postmodern concepts of the period, music, lyrics, personalities etc.  The one thing that amazed me was this: despite being full of Beatles songs, lyrics, characters named from their songs, period correct clothes, drugs, sex, attitudes, and looks, it still felt as if nothing was tied together.  The Beatles songs are adventurous and organic, to me, and this movie betrayed those two things for a large portion.  I didn't expect, or want a revival show, but the material provided by this movie sucked, more or less. Only a few of the versions prove to be interesting enough to exist (happiness is a warm gun, come together, being for the benefit of mr. kite), none of the characters stand out, and the visual style is scattershot saccharine which saps even psychedelia of it's authenticity. The film is just painfully bland when it should be edgy. It doesn't allow any dramatic payoff because there's no depth, or development, it just runs along. I'm not a fan of Julie Taymor, because I find her to be a visual stylist who can't make a satisfying film from front to back, but can occasionally dazzle you. Here, she tries that and is only successful once (during mr. kite).  There are moments of good performances to be found in this movie, but the rest of movie made me forget, or at least become mad that they weren't more frequent.  This movie did make me mad while watching it because it seems that they often weren't going for anything in particular except an honorary invitation to the 21st century extravaganza club (big films without true joy, or emotion). Roger Ebert is intelligent in his opinions, but has been wrong more than once about the films he chooses to review these days, at least I didn't agree him that is.  He said he didn't even want to hear the argument that the songs weren't like the original versions, stating that they're timeless songs that belong to no one. I didn't want, or expect them to be, Roger, but you have to consider there's a reason these particular songs were chosen and are considered timeless.  It's because they were well-written and brilliantly performed pop songs.  When you take out the inspiration for these songs and make them fit your own revisionist purposes....they're not so timeless, they're disposable.  They also have no backing within a true story, it's only a plot that's as thin as the paper used to play the game Thin Ice and unconvincing like Clinton saying he had no sexual relations with...you know. Add to that the fact the brilliance with which these songs were performed is gone and often without exuberance, or true spirit. Sometimes the film and music come together and make up for this like in the bowling scene for "I've just seen a face" but these times of excellence are few and far between. The film tries to overcompensate by having every visual be a symbol and it just becomes monotonous and tiring thing to endure. It actually makes the film harder to take for me. I actually thought of walking out and kind of wish I did. I'll say the last gripe that I can remember before I end this acknowledged hate-fest of this film and end it quickly. The film takes a wide open approach to the ideology and activism of the time and in some ways presents a wide open movie full of such non-mainstream elements like casual sex, hippie posturing, Vietnam rehashing, drugs. I say non-mainstream because the 60's presents a type simultaneous naivete and danger concerning these subjects that's never developed in this movie so as a result you get the sex without the hornyness, or joy, the hippiness without the stupidity, the radicalism without the conscience, and violence...well, there wasn't really any violence in it, or drugs for that matter, it just feels fake. The film is pg-13 and it's riding R, and even material that would bypass that into the NC-17 arena, but because we're dealing with Beatles songs they don't even passably go all the way (in so many ways). This treatment feels dishonest to me and should never, ever, have been.  It makes me feel like I imagine I would if I were to watch the Sergeant Pepper movie with the Bee Gees. Like that movie, this movie should never have been made.</p></body></html>

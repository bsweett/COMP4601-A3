<meta name="summary" content="a no-talent director & no-talent stars make a mockery of johnny cash"></head><body><p>i had given this a second star, but then i thought to myself: why? this movie is abominable. its not just the amateurish performance by joaquin phoenix as johnny cash -- i never thought anyone could sing flatter than the REAL cash -- or the squeaking by reese witherspoon as june carter. its the whole damned show! how often have you ever seen a musical when the songs actually STOPPED the action (i can only think of richard attenboroughs dreadful interpretation of "a chorus line")? but the REAL villain here is james mangold, the director who previously gave us that alltime classic "girl interrupted". its bad enough that hacks are given millions of dollars to make movies, but i urge you to listen to this guys commentary on the dvd; he is a pretentious jerk who honestly believes he has made a significant work of art. at least the hacks in old hollywood knew they were hacks and were willing to work within their weaknesses, thus often turning out fine professional work. this guy mangold is a moron -- the technique of a buffoon and the limited talent of an ed wood (without the freak show imagination). i cut this down from 2 stars to 1 because i resent that i gave up a few hours of my life to watch this stupid unprofessional ugly movie!</p></body></html>

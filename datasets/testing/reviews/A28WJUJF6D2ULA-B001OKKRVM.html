The camera crews who braved sub-zero temperatures, gale-force winds, dangerous oceanic storms and months away from home have given the world an enduring visual wonder. View March of the Penguins and you will behold absolutely lovely scenes of star-dappled black velvet skies free of lights or pollution, vast blue-white sheets of primeval ice, twisting helices of aurora australis, crystal-clear ocean waters, and above all, it will show you the hard life endured by penguins, who not only survive but prosper in the most forbidding location on planet earth. See this classic documentary and you'll watch as these gentle birds trek scores of miles in Sisyphean fashion on their annual migrations; you'll witness them dive nearly a quarter-mile below vast ice sheets, and evade shark-like leopard seals in order to feed; and as they devote themselves with such tenderness to the care and raising of their vulnerable young, I guarantee you'll feel that there is something uniquely special in these plodding, flightless creatures. These are all sights we humans would never otherwise get to see were it not for the labor of a select few who took great risks to bring the fantastic footage to us. While the very young among viewers might find the pace of March of the Penguins a little slow-moving, most who see us should be awe-struck, impressed, and informed by this cinematic marvel. Easily five stars, and most definitely worth owning so you can see it more than once!</p></body></html>

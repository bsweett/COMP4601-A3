<meta name="summary" content="SUPERMAN that really works with the laws of Physics.. I like it.."></head><body><p>Check out the plane crash... he doesnt just stop it, he has to manage the plane from breaking to bits.. Lets say if he was to stand in front of the plane going 600 mph the plane would rip apart as it crashes through him.. so I liked the realism there..<br /><br />OH and Superman's Girlfriend is actually HOT... whereas I loved Christopher Reeves... In fact there will not be anyone to take his place ... but " Margo Kidder " who were they Kiddering ??? That girl would be known as a 2 bagger.. you wear a bag just in case hers falls off..</p></body></html>

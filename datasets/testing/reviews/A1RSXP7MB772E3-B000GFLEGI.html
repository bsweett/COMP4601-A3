It does tread down that boring road of exploring zombies, who deny the belief that the walking undead is unthinking (come on, give me a break, who gives a crap!) I wanted more of a message about todays twisted politics. By the way, he did attempt to have a back story, with that of the rich above and the poor below*cliche. Hooper was miscasted as the corrupt leader, shouldn't we have a man beaming with power and authority, not the causual "zombies, they freak me out" guy? I couldn't care less what happened to anyone in this movie, so when their lives came were at risk, I was like, "Ho hum, okay okay, next." But it is a movie you have to see for yourself, I'm not attempting to drive away sales from this movie, especially since Romero is the one who "created" this genre. I have a deep respect for his trilogy, and I would hate for this to be his last film. But, on the other hand, enough with the "raaahr", zombies(thinking).</p></body></html>

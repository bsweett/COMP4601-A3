<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE SCARIEST MOVIES EVER MADE!!!"></head><body><p>This is one of the few movies that have consistently given me nightmares since I was a child.  It is at least a decade ahead of its time.  Most of the negative criticisms that I have read use the word "uneven" a lot.  Even Roger Ebert, whom I admire, claimed that the humor and the horror were an uneasy mix.  This was years before he gave the movie Scream a positive review.  Now I LIKE the movie Scream, but there is no way that one can claim that it gets the balance right whereas Werewolf gets it wrong.  Scream simply benefits from occurring in the cynical nineties - Werewolf suffers from being avant guard.  .<p>The new DVD has a few good extras on it - especially a new interview with Landis.  Even after all these years, the film still holds up.  Unlike most films, I see more things in it the more I look.  What, for instance, is up with the townsfolk of East Proctor and what is their relationship with the original werewolf?  My guess - they brought it on themselves somehow.  Maybe one of their own ran over a gypsy and was cursed.  Instead of killing the bloke, they all decide to hide beneath the pentangle in The Slaughtered Lamb every full moon.<p>I am recently returned from England and this movie is listed in Fodor's as one of the films that best showcases London.  I heartily agree.  I visited the infamous tube stop at Tottenham Court Road and it still looks much the same as when the David made his kill there.  And as I walked, alone in the countryside, beneath the light of the full moon, I had to ask myself, "Am I crazy?"  Fortunately, I made it to the pub.  There I waited, beneath the pentangle, for my friends to walk me home.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gripping Plot, Plus Theories On The Inner Meaning Of `Like A Virgin'..."></head><body><p>Recently I saw Reservoir Dogs for the first time since the '90's, and was struck at how perfect, just dead-on flawless, Quentin Tarantino's writing was in this edge-of-your nerves movie. It says something that somehow Reservoir Dogs seemed far less violent to me today than I remembered in high school, and I think that signifies a lot about how far violence has pervaded the media as well as the entertainment industry (which are increasingly one and the same, aren't they?).<br /><br />For those who don't know, this possessingly intricate story, told in flashback/flash forward/non-linear style tells of a gang of would-be jewelry store robbers hired by a crime boss and his son to commit a fast ("in and out in two minutes no matter what") heist in downtown Los Angeles one lackluster morning. Unknown to each other, these specialists from various corners of the nation are assigned names like "Mr. Blond" "Mr. White" "Mr. Blue" "Mr. Pink" "Mr. Orange" etc. and given precise instructions never to give out any real information about themselves as they go about securing a cache of diamonds recently imported from Israel. In classic Tarantino fashion all goes as wrong as it possibly can, police intervene, blood spurts, gunfire cracks like thunder and innocent lives are horribly lost, as what began amid a laid-back breakfast laced with rapid-fire profanity and cerebral analysis of Madonna's`80's anthem "Like A Virgin" suddenly shifts to a second act in a warehouse in which the remnants of the crew assemble, each paranoically aware that one among them is a police informer. But who is it? Even the audience doesn't know till after it's sat in dismay through one of the more gruesome torture sequences ever caught on celluloid.<br /><br />The first couple times you see this great classic, you'll be dazed, but sooner or later it'll hit you, as it has me, that the screenplay for Reservoir Dogs might be some of the best writing ever done in Hollywood. Owning it on DVD is the best way to take in all the easy to miss twists and turns not only in the plot but in the adrenaline-propelled dialogue. Five stars!</p></body></html>

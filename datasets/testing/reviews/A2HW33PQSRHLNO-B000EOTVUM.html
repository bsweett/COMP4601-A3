I thought they already made "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; and if enough people wanted to see it done with Australian accents, I'm sure Tobe Hooper would have obliged for the right price.<br /><br />I'm sure the director didn't expect so much acclaim, as he wisely decided to play the "Based On True Events" card (it is very loosely based on two different incidents, neither of which occured in the Australian outback.)<br /><br />This isn't a terrible movie, but there is nothing in it to set it apart from a billion others of the same ilk.  Three young people who want fun fun fun wander into the wrong place and are brutalized by a psychotic killer.  The protagonists (not really protagonists, more like three pieces of convenient prey) are three Swedish backpackers who get drunk, smoke weed, swim in pools, and go on about failed romances when the Big Bad Guy comes along to deliver the inevitable message these kind of movies carry: if you take too much of a risk, you get chopped up for your daring.  The painfully long time we spend with the guy (who might have been an extra on "Jackass") and the two young women tell us little about them except that they are cut whole cloth from the stereotype of "youth" in society and are innocents who have done nothing wrong.<br /><br />The killer, Mick Taylor, is a cross between a sadistic killer, failed Elvis impersonator (those muttonchops add a bit of comedy to everything he does, however gruesome), and failed comedian.  His attempts to humorous and terrifying at the same time fail miserably with the sombre mood of the movie.<br /><br />There is one geuinely funny part, though: before he drugs the three with his special water, he takes offense at something the young guy says and gives him a rooster look as though he had been buggered by Popeye himself.  I nearly hit the theater floor laughing when that scene came up.<br /><br />More less, this is your typical slasher movie.  Greg McLean seems to be trying to a convey a sense of "the hunt" or whatever, but it falls dead in the air.  This isn't awful; it just isn't that good one way or the other.</p></body></html>

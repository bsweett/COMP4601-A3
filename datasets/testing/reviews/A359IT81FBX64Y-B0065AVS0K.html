It takes gratuitous violence to uninspired levels of depravity, and it pretends at a plot by interweaving multiple storylines and characters, all of which is too clever by half and amounts to a house of cards. This is a movie in which every male character is either a killer or a cop (sometimes both), and every female character is a Black Belt prostitute. Almost nothing makes sense, so you must watch the film as a pure sensory experience - albeit a very gruesome one. Some characters possess supernatural powers; we never discover why. I liked Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, but even though Sin City adopted elements of those two films, I absolutely hated it. If viewing two hours of violence and torture is your idea of entertainment, then by all means, see this movie. If it is not, stay away. At best, you will feel bored; at worst, you will feel disgusted. This film creates a new genre: The Sadomasochistic Fantasy.</p></body></html>

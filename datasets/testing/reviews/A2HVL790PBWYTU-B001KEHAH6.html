<meta name="summary" content="Jenna, to a waitress at a club: "Oh, wait! Make it a Pina Colada, not virgin. Do you want to see my I.D.? I totally have it.""></head><body><p>The highlight, of course, is the exuberant "Thriller" dance number. But let's not twist this, there are many moments worth watching in 13 GOING ON 30. Above all, you're dragged along in the wake of Jennifer Garner's charm and the infectious joy with which she plays Jenna. Not that she's produced a lot of stuff on the silver screen, but 13 GOING ON 30, breezy and laugh-out-loud funny, is without a doubt my favorite Jennifer Garner flick.<br /><br />It's all about wish fulfillment, and, because we've already seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC4ZF8">Big (Extended Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMCW">Freaky Friday</a>, we already know that the inherent lesson here is that be content within yourself and also that there's no place like home. It's a given that Jenna Rink will learn this lesson in due time, but not just yet. Because that would deny us the pleasure of watching then 32-year-old Jennifer Garner go thru her silly shenanigans. So, first, whilst being doused in magic dust, thirteen-year-old Jenna, experiencing a disastrous birthday, wishes that she were "thirty and flirty and thriving." She then wakes up to find herself in a beautiful 30-year-old body. What's more, she now resides in New York City in her own posh apartment and holding down a gig as a big-time fashion magazine editor.<br /><br />The movie then shows us obligatory (yet wickedly humorous) scenes of Jenna striving to act mature, and not quite getting there. I got a quick chuckle from a brief shot of Jenna scoping out "Magazine Publishing for Dummies." Plenty of fun call-backs to 1980s pop culture, to a time when people really were that into Rick Springfield and where "Everybody Wang Chung tonight" kind of meant something. Me, I barely remember Razzles, let alone that they're both a candy AND a gum.<br /><br />And then, as they're wont to do, the movie gets a bit serious (but, thankfully, not too serious). We learn that the woman Jenna had become is not a nice person. We also learn that the magazine she works for is suffering an alarming decline in popularity and in sales. Tons of pressure on Jenna, regarded as a bright star in the world of haute couture periodicals. Will Jenna get her act together? Will she make amends with her estranged former best friend Mattie, played, by the way, with down-to-earth appeal by Mark Ruffalo?<br /><br />It's key that Jennifer Garner is not at all afraid of looking silly and awkward here. It's key that she's a good enough actress that we come to care for her character. And it's important that Ruffalo is around to provide grounded support and that dang good romantic spark. Meanwhile, subtly duplicitous and a bit buggy-eyed, Judy Greer is pitch perfect as Jenna's current best friend. And, yes, I dare you high school graduates of the '80s to not get all nostalgic when the soundtrack kicks up. I can't believe I forgot how much I liked Billy Joel's "Vienna Waits for You." I've never really been a fan of Pat Benatar's "Love Is A Battlefield" but the movie's use of it as an anthem is pretty well done.<br /><br />I've been digging Jennifer Garner since her superspy days in ALIAS, and when 13 GOING ON 30 came out, I figured this was just the stage to propel her to bigger and better things. But, for some reason, she's kept a low profile in the years following 2004, excepting all the trashy Bennifer media blitz (yet another reason to dislike Ben Affleck). Thankfully, her recent good turns in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7WGOW">The Kingdom (Widescreen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014CQNTK">Juno (Two-Disc Special Edition with Digital Copy)</a> have gotten her back on track. But, while she's shown off her dramatic skills in these other roles, to me, she was still never better than when she was "thirty and flirty and thriving." A totally endearing performance.</p></body></html>

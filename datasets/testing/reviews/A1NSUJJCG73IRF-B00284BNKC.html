<meta name="summary" content="Requiem for a Dream  (2000)"></head><body><p>Director:  Darren Aronofsky<br /><br />Cast:  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Lasser, Marcia Jean Kurtz, Janet Sarno.<br /><br />Running Time:  102 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for intense depiction of drug addiction, graphic sexuality, strong language and some violence.<br /><br />"Requiem for a Dream" tells the story of 4 people, connected either through blood or some kind of personal relationship, whether it is family, girlfriend, or business partner. Although the characters lived far from what you and I would consider to be normal lifestyles, they shared something in common with each and every member of the audience; hopes, aspirations, dreams. Sara Goldfarb (played so wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn) dreams of one day being on a TV show, and one day, gets her chance. She fantasizes about how she could wear her favorite red dress, which she wore to her sun's graduation, on television; however, upon trying to wear the red dress, Sara discovers that she has gained some weight over the years and tries desperately to lose her weight, eventually resorting to medication. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale along with their friend Tyrone (Shawn Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can open up her own (legal) business. Unfortunately, their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly.  The movie documents how for each of the 4 people are effected and eroded by drugs.<br /><br />The look of the film is extremely stylized, but justifiably so. Aronofsky uses surreal imagery as a vehicle for realism, something that really works when done well, and done well it was. By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots, extreme close-ups and more edits than you can shake a stick at; Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem. The audience visually experiences first-hand what it is like to be 'scared' or 'high'; all this in 3rd person; all this in the comfort of the theatre chair.  Of course, all of this effort would be in vain if it didn't mean anything at the end. The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale, which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film. The pacing at the end, when compared to earlier parts of the movie, was so fast that some viewers may find it hard to keep up, and it will literally take your breath away when the credits came up. All in all, the effect was amazing, and something that audiences haven't felt much since "American Beauty" and "American History X".  As the title indicates, "Requiem for a Dream" does not contain a happy ending. It is in no way optimistic and only gives the audience faint pieces of hope and happiness; however, it does show what desperate people are willing to do, and how desperation will change someone's life to its entirety. It is in the recognition of desperation where hope lies.</p></body></html>

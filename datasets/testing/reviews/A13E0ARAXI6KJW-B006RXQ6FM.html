<meta name="summary" content="The Quality of Mercy Is Not Strained in This Compelling Actors' Showcase"></head><body><p>Director/writer John Patrick Shanley measures the quality of mercy in his uncommonly well-crafted 2008 adaptation of his 2004 Broadway hit. One can imagine how well his intimate story must have played onstage as a four-actor chamber piece since the vivid personal interactions raise large questions about morality and organized religion. The title refers to the religious doubt that results when faith is not enough to reconcile suspicion with intellectual certainty. The subject of doubt is a popular priest who could be violating his position of trust and power. The question then becomes whether the severity of an accusation is enough to convict someone of wrongdoing and how the accuser must live with the consequences of raising doubt among others without the burden of proof.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1964, a year after Kennedy's assassination, in a non-segregated Bronx Catholic school. It's a time of great tumult in the church with the Second Vatican sweeping in reforms that prove unsettling to old-school Catholics like Sister Aloysius, the strict school principal who terrorizes the students with her mean-spirited, iron hand tactics. She is offended by ballpoint pens, too much sugar in others' tea, and the possible use of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001VNC">Frosty The Snowman</a> in the holiday pageant. Her adversary is also her immediate superior, Father Flynn, a compassionate young priest who is fully immersed in the daily life of his congregation, particularly with the schoolboys whom he coaches in basketball and in life's lessons. She is suspicious of his motives, and when Sister James, an innocent novice, reports that one of her students, Donald Miller, returned from a meeting with the priest behaving strangely, Sister Aloysius becomes determined to remove him from his post.<br /><br />What Shanley does particularly well with this set-up is ensure we never know the true story and whether Sister Aloysius' assumptions are based in hard evidence. The ensemble cast is superior. It becomes redundant to praise Meryl Streep, but she does bring an ardent fervor and unapologetic small-mindedness to the formidable Sister Aloysius with a convincing accent that comes by way of the Grand Concourse. She infuses her vinegary character with welcome humor. As Flynn, Philip Seymour Hoffman manages to bring enough ambiguity to the priest to make the suspicions palpable, while Amy Adams plays Sister James with her natural perkiness toned down to reflect her character's questioning conscience. As Donald's anguished mother, Viola Davis blazes with quiet authority in an impressive face-off with Sister Aloysius that ends with an unsettling revelation. Shanley brings out all the dramaturgy of his work with full gale force and does not shy away from the dark, somber theme. It's just a good thing the actors make it intensely involving as well.</p></body></html>

Based on the Marvel comic book and created by the brilliant Stan Lee, IRON MAN is a super-hero, a science fiction, an action-action adventure, and a heartwarming, feel-good movie, all rolled into one.<br /><br />In IRON MAN, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a playboy genius, a cross between DaVinci, Tesla, and Don Juan.  As the CEO of Stark Industries, he has single handedly revolutionized the defense industry in his attempt to bring security and peace to the world.  When he is kidnapped by terrorists, Tony Stark realizes that the technology he has been steadily inventing since he was a child is falling into the wrong hands, bringing devastation and death to those he is trying to protect.  In captivity, Stark builds the prototype IRON MAN suit, and escapes.  Back at home, Stark has a crisis of conscience and decides to stand down Stark Industries weapons divisions.  Building the ultimate mech suit, Stark becomes IRON MAN, and single handedly sets out to end terrorism and save the world.  Of course, nothing is ever easy...<br /><br />All of the performances in IRON MAN are excellent and very enjoyable.  Robert Downey, Jr.'s transition from philandering whiz kid to caring, sincere patriot who wants to do the right thing is outstanding and real.  The rest of this fantastic cast (Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub) are equally good, creating believable, genuine characters, both good and evil.  The special effects rock, and are seamless and very fun.  The computer that runs Stark's home and inhabits the IRON MAN suit is very funny, exhibiting an acerbic wit that must have been very fun to write.<br /><br />There are some pretty big clues that are more IRON MAN movies to come.  I sure hope so.  I can't wait to see IRON MAN continue his fight for "truth, justice, and the American way."</p></body></html>

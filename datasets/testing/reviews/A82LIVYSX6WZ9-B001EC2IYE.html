<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood at the top, Swank her best, Freeman still the man.."></head><body><p>Though it is not the best movie I have seen it is full of honest performances by Hilary Swank (Insomnia, Boys Dont Cry) and especially Morgan Freeman (Lean On Me, Kiss The Girls and all the other films hes been in). Swank plays a woman who is a waitress and she wants to be trained into the boxing world and she wants Clint Eastwood (Blood Work, True Crime, Absolute Power) to teach her but he wont because he thinks shes weak but in the end he does. Freeman plays a old boxer who lives in the boxing gym and who is blind in one eye. He also helps out Swank. Also the characters are well written, Swank has a family that only wants money and doesnt care about her boxing and Eastwood is stricken with the fact that his daughter is dead to him and he doesnt have a relationship with her, though she sends him letters but he never reads them. He becomes closer to Swank and its kinda like a father/daughter relationship between the two. In the end Swank does become a good boxer but she gets hospitalized after one championship fight with a made of steel femme boxer. A damn good piece of film in which gives another nod to Clint Eastwood but I like Mystic River more then this one...that's only me. Freeman stands out in a wonderful performance giving him a memorable scene in which he fights a young punk boxer. Swank has never been sweeter and Eastwood is still at the top of his game. If there's a movie our there right now that you wanna go see and enjoy with a loved one or maybe by yourself...this is a good one.</p></body></html>

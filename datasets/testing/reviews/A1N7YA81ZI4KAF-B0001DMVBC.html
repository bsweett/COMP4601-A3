<meta name="summary" content="Tragic and unforgettable. This is a must see film."></head><body><p>An utterly depressing but effective film that will have the viewer questioning their morals and that of society's. The film centres around 2 key characters. One is a troubled young woman who is wrongfully evicted from her home and the other is a determined Iranian immigrant who works as hard as he can to provide for his family. The two meet under unfortunate circumstances and unwillingly set off a chain of events that escalates into madness and tragedy. There are several victims in this film. The first being Connelly who is injustly thrown out in to the streets. The second is the determined Kingsley who is unjustly thrown into emotional turmoil by the thought of buying a house that rightfully belongs to someone else. The third is Kingsley's family, who after finding out what has occurred are  thrown in to the chaos. And lastly, Ron Eldard, Connelly's only ally who becomes a victim of his consuming passion for her.<br /><br />This film is dark and depressing and the characters are all gloomy adding a touch of pathos to the already somber tone of the film. As mentioned previously, it had me questioning my morals and at the same time, made me furious at society's lack of compassion and reason. Although the film is not based on a true story, you can see something like this happening in real life and the tragic characters are so expertly played by the actors, most notably Ben Kingsley, Jennifer Connelly and Shohreh Aghdashloo, that your heart goes out to every single individual in the film. Aghdashloo's performance as Kingsley's wife is especially spellbinding. Her facial expressions, her voice combined with her incredible performance haunted me for days. Her character is emotionally rich. She emanates kindness and grace and she is the most sympathetic character in the film. The scene (towards the end of the film) in which she awakens from a dream is so incredibly touching, it almost moved me to tears.<br /><br />Brilliant performances, captivating characters and a compelling story makes this one of the most powerful film's I have seen in a very long time. It is highly recommended but a box of kleenix should be at arm's reach. This film is that effective.</p></body></html>

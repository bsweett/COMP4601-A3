Three young people set out on a hiking vacation to Wolf Creek in Australia, where they run into a crazed local killer. There isn't all that much gore, but there are a few slightly nasty scenes. For the budget used to produce the film, it is a successful movie. It is definitely worth watching, but I wouldn't care to own it for repeated viewings.</p></body></html>

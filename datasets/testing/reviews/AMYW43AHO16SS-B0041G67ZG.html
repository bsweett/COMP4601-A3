The movie works during the first 30 minutes as a US interpreter hear about a possible assasination attempt on a controversial African leader.  Then the film goes into a lull of boring dialogue for the next 25 minutes.  Then the suspense starts up again as we find out she's being followed by unknown assassins.  Then another boring lull of dialogue!  The climax of the film finally brings all the pieces of the puzzle together, saving the film from certain destruction.  There's enough mystery and suspense to keep you entertained.  Recommended!</p></body></html>

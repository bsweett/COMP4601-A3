<meta name="summary" content=""So What Do You Do For  A Living?"  ~  The Criteria For An Honorable Death"></head><body><p>'The Matador' released in '06 turned out to be a real disappointment to me. I generally like both Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear and had heard alot of praise over this film so I was anxious to see it. Maybe I would have liked it better if I hadn't built up such hig expectations, but I doubt it.<br /><br />Plot: While on a business trip to Mexico City Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) strikes up a conversation with (Julian Noble) Pierce Brosnan in a bar late one night just before closing. They end up attending a bull fight together the next day and become friends even after Julian confides the secret of his occupation to the curious Danny. He's an assassin.<br /><br />Years go by and they live their separate lives until Julian shows up at Danny's doorstep late one night. Julian is in trouble and needs Danny's help. Danny must decide if Julian is really a friend worth helping.<br /><br />The acting of both Brosnan and Kinnear is top notch, but the storyline just didn't work for me. They're both marvellous actors, worth viewing at least once if you're a fan of either.</p></body></html>

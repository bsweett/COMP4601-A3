<meta name="summary" content="Psycho Snore -"></head><body><p>"Shutter Island" is set in 1954 and the main character, Edward "Teddy" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a former World War II soldier.  Teddy is now a U.S. Marshal that investigates the disappearance of a patient from a strange prison-like mental hospital on the rocky formidable East Coast Shutter Island.  The hospital is for the criminally insane.  Teddy is shown traveling on a boat to Shutter Island with his Deputy (Mark Ruffallo).  The waves and wind make him sick and he has to sit down when he reaches the office of the head of the institution. Ben Kingsley plays the man in charge and explains the radical treatments they perform here.  While Teddy is trying to get his "land legs" he is given a pill for headaches.<br /><br />Teddy has strange dreams, flashbacks, visions during his investigation and paranoia sets in that he is being drugged or poisoned.  Teddy quizzes the head of the institution along with most of the staff on the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient admitted after she murdered her three children.<br /><br />The movie is filled with flashbacks, as you wonder why a U.S. Marshall was sent to such a place.  More and more psychological issues arise and Teddy suspects the authorities in charge are not telling him the truth.  The remote Ward C looms large in his mind, he thinks they are holding the arsonist who murdered his wife.<br /><br />Secrets are unraveled that Teddy fights hard not to believe.<br /><br />"Shutter Island" is not that engaging and the abundance of eerie visions end up being more of a sideshow.  It is a hard-to-believe premise for a story, but they try to give it weight by quoting German Concentration Camp and North Korean experiments with prisoners.  Overall, the movie was a psycho snore.</p></body></html>

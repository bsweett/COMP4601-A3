<meta name="summary" content="Death of a Saleman's wife"></head><body><p>A strange venture into suburbia as it was in the early 50's.<br />A young couple with ideals meet after WWII and marry,<br />and several years later find themselves in a little suburb home<br />with the ideal family of a boy and a girl.<br />There self -concept of being different and interesting<br />begins to rip at their relationship.<br />He has an affair with at work and she develops<br />a plan to move to his favorite city Paris.<br />All this gets shot down by a promotion that comes out of his handling of a minor<br />file at work. This movie even has a mad math PhD whose opinions<br />they seem to resonate with.<br />I found myself thinking that this was maybe an important movie,<br />even as it became hard to watch.</p></body></html>

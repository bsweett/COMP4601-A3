<meta name="summary" content="No Brakes On a Train"></head><body><p>Unstoppable is a really pedestrian film that bad in all departments except that Denzel helps drag it above the quality level of an episode of Burn Notice. The basic premise is that a train carrying some toxic chemicals has been sent on its driver-less way because the driver decided to get out of the hotseat after pressing the "Go" button. The obstacles and problems are all the sorts of things you'd get at a Screenwriters 101 course:<br /><br />- There is a train full of schoolchildren coming the other way.<br />- The head boss corporate guy is trying to cover it up and/or cut corners.<br />- There's a nice little town in the way that looks like Main Street 50 years ago and it's going to get wiped out.<br /><br />Although not a total train wreck (excuse the pun), I think director Tony Scott needs to step up his game.</p></body></html>

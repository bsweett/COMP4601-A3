<meta name="summary" content="Fun and Often Funny - Recommended"></head><body><p>"Mr. And Mrs. Smith" is an enjoyable and very watchable action flick that also has a lot very funny scenes interspersed through out. This review is for the "R" rated Amazon OnDemand version.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The movie centers on a typical upper-middle class couple living a seeming normal life in suburbia, but both leading double lives as assassins. The pace of the movie starts out a little slowly, but picks up as their relationship and work lives begin to collide.<br /><br />There is definite on screen chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and that goes a long way to compensate for some of the slower scenes and occasionally hokey situations.<br /><br />This is not a very deep movie, but it is a good choice when looking for a lot of action, a little romance, and a laugh or two.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

I loved the visual stuff, the plot and the storyline. I thought Bruce Willis, Mickie Rourke, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro were Brilliant! It reminded me of Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino had a little to do with this film and it shows)when you know the middle (because it is shown at the beginning), and you have to follow the story and arrive back at the middle and see it to the end. If you like movies like "Sixth Sense", "Pulp Fiction", and the "Others" (although that was not one of my favorites), you will understand and appreciate Sin City. Stated simply, everything is not what it seems.</p></body></html>

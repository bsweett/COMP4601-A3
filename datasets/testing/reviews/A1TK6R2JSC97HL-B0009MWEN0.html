<meta name="summary" content="Should mankind survive?"></head><body><p>Loosely based on the Heinlein novel, "Troopers" follows the weirdly lucky "Rico", a soldier in the army of the future.  In the clean world-of-tomorrow, with mankind having extended his reach across the galaxy, his only obstacle are the arachnids, a vicious insect race that seems to act mindlessly yet can travel through space by shooting spores like rockets. Lacking any technology, Arachnids can wipe out armies, bring down the mighty starships of the federation, and even launch huge asteroids at man's most heavily populated worlds. Slowly but surely, the federation realizes that the bugs aren't a mindless infestation that will allow itself to be exterminated, but a calculating enemy that must be wiped out. With their greater numbers and lower regard for any life (including their own) the bugs take the upper hand, and the only extermination that man can now envision is his very own.<br /><br />The great thing about "Star Ship Troopers" is that Director Paul Verhoeven, makes the extinction of man plausible and yet funny.  With his reach approximating an empire maintained by huge starfleets and vast armies, mankind adheres to a philosophy of "might-makes-right". With Verhoeven's signature multimedia narrative clearly illuminating a society in love with its own power, we may even wonder whether the bugs are fighting in defense against an implacable enemy that simply had it coming.<br /><br />Early on, we meet Rico in high-school, where he (and us) learns the political realities of our future - in which only a select few have the right of citizenship.  The arachnids are already a threat, but not yet an enemy when Rico graduates high school and volunteers for "Mobile Infantry".  Soon the situation changes and mankind realizes it's at war against hordes of merciless killing machines.<br /><br />"Troopers" is good, yet never becomes great.  It's fun to see Verhoeven's dark-themed future, in which mankind seems to be skating cheerily on the edge of fascism (the clothing styles, inspired by German WWII militaria, drive the point home), yet it's never quite as biting as the similar "RoboCop".  The CGI is nice, but never spectacular - the flick seems to have imagined a future looking little different than something from the 80's "Buck Rogers" show.  None of the characters stand out, and much of the action is episodic.  That said, the flick manages to toss us some surprises - like Clancy Brown as a mechanically homicidal drill instructor, and Michael Ironsides as Rico's no-nonsense boss.</p></body></html>

This is one of those films you either have an appreciation for OR it will really make you hate the director all over again.  Either way, it's worth a look!  The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and on Blu-Ray it's top notch.  What a picture!  The clarity of the trees blowing in the wind and the atmospheric dread M. Night displays in this is really something to behold.  James Newton Howard's score is also something noteworthy.  Very moody, dark, miserable and looming.  Subtle and sublime in some areas and downright horrifying in others, "The Happening" puts you in a situation where you really contemplate how you would react in a situation like this.  It makes me laugh when someone judges the "acting" in this film because the characters are made to play like this is "real life," not acting.  This movie isn't aiming for acting awards.  The film is a coaster ride into something unimaginable, frightening and at the same time exhilarating and ultimately satisfying.  If one thing is true for me, I now have a deeper appreciation for this director again and look forward to his next project!</p></body></html>

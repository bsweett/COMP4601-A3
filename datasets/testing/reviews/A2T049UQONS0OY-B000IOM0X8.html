<meta name="summary" content="A pleasing Steve Zahn vehicle with a lot of good outdoor scenes"></head><body><p>Character actor Steve Zahn is the main attraction in this adventure flick about junk hunters that inadvertently get turned onto -- and get involved in a big way with -- a multinational chemical effuent problem generated by a manufacturer in Africa that is causing a continetal disease.<br /><br />Zahn is part of a group that searches for expensive old junk and ends up traversing African countries running into and away from bad guys. Zahn, who is always a pleasure to watch, outduels the bigger name stars in the flick  (Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz among them) and has a great scene near the end where he unloads about 20 guns from his person.<br /><br />This is a fun movie with a lot of great African scenery shot aboard boats and in sand dunes. There's a lot of action that helps you forget this is about the dumbest conglomeration of ideas you've ever seen put together in a movie. The flick starts out during the Civil War and ends up in modern day Africa, and somehow strings together all this nonsense for a feel good ending.<br /><br />Never mind that but pay attention to Zahn. He's a blast and is by far the best thing going in this flick. Fans of high adventure, action and mayhem will like this inventive if somewhat stupid movie. It is exceptionally well shot and lively in almost every frame. Pick it up today if you like these elements but don't hold your breath waiting for any Academy Award nominations.</p></body></html>

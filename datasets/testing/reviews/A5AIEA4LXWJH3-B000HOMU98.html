<meta name="summary" content="Impressive Video, Disappointing Audio"></head><body><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The picture was 1.85:1 (or something close to that), and completely filled my widescreen LCD.  I would rather of had 2.40:1.<br /><br />Video quality was very good to great.  I only saw grain on one scene.  I give it a 9.0 out of 10.  Very good for a movie this old.<br /><br />Audio quality was disappointing.  It was only Dolby Digital 5.1, and there were hardly any surround sounds, if any.  The sound came from the fronts and center.  I don't recall any sub-woofer bass, but I could be mistaken on that.<br /><br />Overall, a good Blu-Ray purchase.</p></body></html>

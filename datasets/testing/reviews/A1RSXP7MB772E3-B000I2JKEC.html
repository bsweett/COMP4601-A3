<meta name="summary" content="Christopher Reeves is the only Superman"></head><body><p>There is so much to adore in Superman: The movie. The original Superman is my favorite Superhero movie, beating out its sequel: The Donner cut. It starts off like a science fiction picture rather than a man of steel. I felt Donner handled the backstory with as much respect as some personal project. It was handled with awesome care. And what star power included! Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Jackie Cooper, Glen Ford, and the previously unknown Christopher Reeves.<br /><br />Christopher Reeves gathers so much love for this role that no other actor has yet to be identified as Superman. I point out one scene that strikes harder than any other, and that is the scene where Louis dies in his arms and Superman lets out a furious and screaming charge to change human destiny. It stirred my soul more than even the masterpiece symphonic soundtrack even! And we all can agree that John Williams has created one of the greatest soundtracks ever here.<br /><br />The more I think about the earth changing end, the more points I give it for creativity and fun. I put myself in supermans red cape, faced with his lovers lost, and my physical powers are surging within me. With my extraterrestrial knowledge of the physics of the universe I do something that exceeds any measure of extraordinary power ever demonstrated before. I change the course of Human history. Damn everything else. And I stop being a critic at this point and I am just a bleeding heart poet now. And it adds to me love for this unbelievable film.<br /><br />Note: I do not own this movie, but I have seen this BD product and I recommend it.</p></body></html>

They know Tom Hanks can carry a movie, but can Tom Hanks BE the movie? I'd say the answer is "yes," in a quiet sort of way.<p>Chuck Noland (TH) is a fast-talking, time-obsessed workaholic with just enough charm to keep him from being totally obnoxious.  He has a big job, probably as an industrial engineer in time management for FedEx, which is ironically omnipresent throughout the movie.  Chuck barely has time to court the lovely Helen Hunt (her talents totally wasted in this vapid role).  He exchanges Christmas presents with her in the car at the airport before he takes off on his fateful voyage.<p>The plane crashes into the sea near an atoll/island.  The crash is frighteningly horrific and terrifying.  All hands are lost except Chuck who is thrown free of the wreckage and driving propellers, and he struggles onto shore.  Up until this time, the movie is full of movement, sound, voices and has a rather brittle frenetic feel.  Now all is silence.  Chuck slowly gets his bearings and we are shown scenes of him trying to cope with his new situation.  FedEx cargo has washed ashore with him, and he opens boxes containing ice skates, a courtier gown and a volley ball that he names "Wilson" after its maker.  He is clumsy and has accidents, but we cannot help but admire his perseverance.  After grueling attempts, he finally gets a fire started and dances around it in pure Tarzan style congratulating himself to the heavens above.  A pause---and it is four years later.  The audience gasps "Four years!"  The physical changes in Chuck are astounding.  From an open-faced, slightly pudgy all-American boy, he has been transformed into a gaunt, sinewy, bearded predator with wary shifting eyes.<p>With great bravery he opts to try and find civilization rather than either suicide or living out his days alone.  He painstakingly builds a raft and turns his back on the only safety he has known for four years.  After great suffering and privitation, he is rescued and flung back into civilization.<p>He reunites with his now-married girlfriend who announces he "is the love of her life."  Does she realize the man standing before her is an entirely different person than the one who left her?  Maybe.  She goes unwillingly back to her family.  Chuck is clearly uncomfortable in almost all social situations and drives to the desolate west, stopping at a crossroads wondering what direction to take.<p>Tom Hanks is marvelous in his role. (It seems I forever say the same thing, because he is always "marvelous in his role.")  The film could have cut out maybe twenty minutes and not suffered a loss.  What is amazing is how he keeps your total attention and interest whether he is building a raft or talking to a volleyball.</p></body></html>

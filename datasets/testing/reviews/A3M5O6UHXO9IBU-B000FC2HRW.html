It was punchier, ingenious and had a twist linking the protaganists to the 180. In 3 the makers assumed we just wanted gorier deaths. Ain't neccessarily so. It was a little too slow and maudlin too. I think the problem with both the sequels is they could not come up with an ending that matched the 'Carter special'. That was just genius, pure and simple. Never the less, I laughed.<br /><br />Why are these films popular? Why were two elderly patrons in the row ahead of me, supposedly outside the projected demographic? I think it's because everybody has a story like my fathers, or knows someone who does. He and his workmate rushed to catch a train just as it was departing. His friend climbed on board and hung out the window urging him to jump aboard. But my father could see the train was full and he would have to stand in the corridor the whole trip so he said he'd catch the next one. The train crashed and his friend was killed. Gonna take a love train....</p></body></html>

While it certainly didn't bump No Country For Old Men from the top spot of my favorite Coen Brother films, it still didn't make me regret buying it either. I would rank it at number two. I actually can see myself growing more and more in to it as I watch it a few more times. Jeff Bridges is perfect as Jeff Lebowski, the Dude. The Dude is a mellow unemployed bowler with a laid back attitude about everything, except his Persian rug. He also has really has a thing for White Russians and pajamas. His character was actually the first thing that pulled me into the story. Jeff Bridges doesn't play The Dude, he IS The Dude.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges has a solid supporting cast as well. John Goodman in one of his five appearances in a Coen brother film, is actually hilarious as Walter. My favorite moments are the times that he tells Steve Buscemi's character "Shut the f**k up, Donnie!" I really enjoyed this movie all the way through, but it could have been better. One thing I had a problem with were the dream scenes where the Dude would either be flying over Los Angeles, running from Russians with scizzors, or some other psychedelic figure. This is just my own personal nitpicks. Fortunately, there are only a few of these dream sequences. Besides that, my only other complaint is that, as extreme the events of the film were, I never really felt excited. In the end, The Big Lebowski is funny enough, and the performances were great. So this movie was worth the purchase.</p></body></html>

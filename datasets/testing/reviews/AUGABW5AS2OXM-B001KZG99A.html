<meta name="summary" content="Stupendous Movie!"></head><body><p>This movie was everything that I had hoped for. Once again a Marvel<br />comic book hero has made a good movie. Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent<br />job of portraying Iron Man(Tony Stark). Tony Stark is the CEO of Stark<br />Industries who manufactures weapons. He is in Afghanistan when his<br />helicopter is blown from the air and he is captured. He is held hostage<br />by al-Quaida terrorists. He is ordered to construct a Jericho missile.<br />On the sly he builds an Iron Man suit. It has weapons and flies at supersonic speeds. He stages a daring escape. He also suffers heart damage during his capture. He comes up with an instrument to help with this condition. He returns to America and fine tunes his invention. He decides to use his invention to fight the forces of evil. Jeff Bridges<br />plays his business mentor and pardner who is trying to take his company away from him. They wind up in a pitched battle. The special effects used by Iron Man are breathtaking and fabulous. This is a must see movie. The<br />scene after the credits adds to the dimension of the movie. A fantastic movie.</p></body></html>

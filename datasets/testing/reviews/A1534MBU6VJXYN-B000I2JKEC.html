<meta name="summary" content="The One That Started All"></head><body><p>This is truly and sincerely the film that paved the way for all great comic book movies. Up until this film, no one had ever thought of putting a serious adaption of a comic book on the big screen, until WB hired Richard Donner to helm a movie based on the popular comic book hero Superman.<br /><br />It seemed like a daunting task. There were difficulties with casting the part (Clint Eastwood and James Caan, among others, turned the role). However, they finally found the right guy in an unknown. 6'4, 20 something actor named Christopher Reeve. A large group of talented actors as well as composer John Williams and other talented behind the scenes whizzes joined Donner and Reeve, and Superman was ready to fly high.<br /><br />The film begins on the planet Krypton, where its leader Jor - El (Marlon Brando) has learned that the planet is about to be done in. Wanting to leave behind an heir, he sends his son Kal - El to Earth, where he is taken in by the Kents (Glenn Ford and an actress whose name I forget). Raised as Clark Kent, he grows up to learn that he has powers far beyond a normal man, and adopts a new persona: Superman. Under his Clark Kent persona, he takes a job at the Daily Planet in Metropolis, where he falls in love with beautiful journalist Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Meanwhile, criminal mastermind Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is plotting to wipe out the West Coast with twin nuclear missiles, and only Superman can stop him. Can Superman save the day? Watch and find out.<br /><br />This is truly a fantastic film. Reeve will always be Superman. The cast, direction and score are great, and this new special edition has it looking and sounding better than it ever has before.<br /><br />This film is an absolute must have for any dvd collection.</p></body></html>

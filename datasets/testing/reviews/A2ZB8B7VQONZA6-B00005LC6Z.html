<meta name="summary" content="NOT AS GOOD AS THE 1ST, BUT STILL GOOD"></head><body><p>HALLOWEEN 2<br />HE'S BAAAAAACK<br /><br />Michael Myers returns to reek havoc on teens every where, and Jamie Lee Curtis is at the top of his menu. Of course Donald Pleasence is still on the hunt for the serial killer, and this film will be the one to leave a Permanente mark on him. When viewing this film it is easy to see that even though the film is good it just isn't the classic the first movie was. The thing that might be the answer to that is probably because a different director steps up, Rick Rosenthal. Don't get me wrong he does an excellent job but he's the having to follow up behind John Carpenter. Speaking of which John and Debra Hill {R.I.P.} return as both producers, and writers. Which pleased me greatly.<br /><br />The story follows as such, it picks up directly where the last left off with Myers being shot out of the house then not being there. Michael is after Jamie again and to get there he has to visit the hospital. Of course it's the same slasher thing, Horney people getting cut up, nothing new. But it still serves its purpose when Michael lurks from the shadows in one scene where his mask slowly comes forward. That was great, truly worthy of mention.<br /><br />Over all this is a worthy sequel all though at times it falls flat.</p></body></html>

How could the committe that created this film miss the point of the original entirely?<br /><br />Re-making the original Day The Earth Stood Still is a real no-brainer; but this film is special effects and nothing else. I saw the I-Max version and I was still bored. No interesting dialog, no great acting (which producer thought "Keanu Reeves? Excellent choice!" and what was he smoking at the time?).<br />Did we see inside the ship? No.<br />Did we learn more about the aliens. No.<br />Was there a big, uplifting speech about universal brotherhood/world peace at the end? Nope.<br />Did stuff blow up real good? Yep.<br />Was there a "Crazy Killer Robot" in the film? Yes!<br />Was Reeves' performance as exciting as one would think? YES.<br /><br />This film does nothing with the original idea, it simply re-tells the same story while blowing things up along the way. What a sad waste of time. I give an extra half star because it was'nt offensive and bad, like Hancock for example.<br /><br />One more thing: 2 Disks? Really? There's barely enough material for one disk.</p></body></html>

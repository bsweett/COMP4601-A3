<meta name="summary" content="Far better than the first adventure.-- looking forward to #3"></head><body><p>I went into this movie with low expectations. Two years earlier I had sat through every disappointing moment of the original movie full of all that missed opportunities and blah blah line deliveries.<br /><br />So, switch to 2004 and my date and I stood outside a movie theater in Reston, Va. pondering our choices. There was DODGEBALL all sold out (to my silent relief since my date was the only one who had expressed an interest in the screwball comedy). Somehow we ended up putting down our cash (or at least mine) for the second Spiderman and I entered the theater and braced myself for what might come.<br /><br />Lo and behold two hours or so later I left the theater energized and excited about the emerging franchise. The simple fact was that this second installment was far better than the first. Not saddled with having to explain Spidey's abilities and his coming to terms with his powers. This follow-up was able to focus on the action and adventure without losing focus on what for me was the best part of the picture - the relationship between Mary Jane (played by the seemingly omnipresent Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker. It was an interesting parting shot that tied up that storyline nicely (at least until the next movie).<br /><br />Another element that separated this movie from its predecessor was Alfred Molina as the main villain. A truly sympathetic character he was not the evil meglomaniacal villain that so often inhabit the superhero canon, but a good man trapped and manipulated by his own invention.<br /><br />One element I really liked was the unmasking of Spiderman (you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean) and this element should lead to some interesting developments in the third movie.<br /><br />Fans should beware that director Sam Raimi is reportedly working on a directors cut for this movie with extra and extended scenes that Columbia TriStar is apparently willing to finance (new spfx etc). I for one will more than likely be picking up the one to be released at the end of this month.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I expected more..."></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that probably would have worked better as a novel than a movie.  The slow pacing left a lot to be desired. I was expecting something more brilliant than what was presented here. Dalton Russell's who, what, and when explanation was fine, but he definitely short-changed us on the why.  Why the heck did he care how Case made his money?  None of the robber's where Jewish.  How did he learn of his past if no one else knew?  Once Dalton and Ms. White had their little dicussion, hence, telling the audience the real deal, I was bored waiting for Det. Frazier and his crew to catch up.  Then I wasn't rewarded well enough for the wait.  Why was Dafoe in this movie?  have the acting gigs dried up that badly that he's taking parts that could have easily gone to a glorified extra?  Foster was good, wouldn't mind having her job.  Overall, it's just okay.  I like Washington more when he does character pieces compared to his action/thriller/ heist stuff.  I can rarely tell those characters apart.</p></body></html>

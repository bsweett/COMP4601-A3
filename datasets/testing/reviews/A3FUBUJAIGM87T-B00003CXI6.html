<meta name="summary" content="This type of movie is often anti-climactic."></head><body><p>"What Lies Beneath" is the type of ghost story movie in the same mold as "Stir Of Echoes", and what I mean by this is that it is a revenge ghost story.  In other words, the ghost in the movie is not the malevolent entity in the movie, but the ghost's killer is.  However, these type of revenge ghost story movies do not work very well to present a truly pure horror movie viewing experience because once you realize the ghost just wants revenge, the focus of the movie changes to the punishment of the mortal killer(s) and much of the suspense and mystery of the supernatural becomes secondary or maybe even lost completely.  This is unfortunate and such is the case with both "What Lies Beneath" and "Stir Of Echoes".  Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer star in "What Lies Beneath" and they are both great actors and I have no problem with them in this movie...no, it's the script that I do not feel presents pure and unadulterated horror.  If you just want to see a drama, this movie is fine but, as a horror movie, it does not function well as such...in fact, as a horror movie, this movie sucks.  The only movie like this that actually works as a horror movie in my opinion is a movie called "The Changeling" with George C. Scott...I would recommend "The Changeling" any day over "What Lies Beneath" or any other movie like this which have become somewhat popular in the horror genre over the last 10-15 years.  Unfortunately, these movies are riddled by a common anti-climactic flaw which extinguishes the mystery of the supernatural which ignited the audience's interest in the movie in the first place.  If people think this is a good drama, that is fine, but I just hate it when I read reviews and get all excited about watching a horror movie and it turns out the movie sucks as a horror movie...such is the case with "What Lies Beneath".</p></body></html>

The movie is the first time the world saw the Robbie Robot character, the same robot give or take a few spare parts from Lost in Space. The crew of the space ship was a complete crew even down to a cook. Laser shooters were used in this movie as well, a Hollywood first. That being said it did have some flaws; the characters were all one dimensional. The story went no where at times. Such as the time where the cook got the robot to synthesize bourbon. Yes some of the plot just seemed like filler. I really got the feeling that Dr. Morbius was based on Captain Nemo from 20000 leagues Jules Verne story. The way how he gave the tour of his world and machinery just seemed so familiar to the 20000 leagues story. Overall this is a fine transfer to DVD, and has quite extras on this DVD package. If you love old science fiction campy films this is a must have.</p></body></html>

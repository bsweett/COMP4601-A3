<meta name="summary" content="An Outstanding Parody and Satire"></head><body><p>This clever comedy wonderfully combines an outrageous parody of the Star Trek genre with a satire on the subculture it generated.  Both are masterfully presented through a brilliant screenplay, a clever script, and first class acting.<br /><br />The film follows the lives of burnt out TV actors collectively representing the actors and characters in Star Trek.  Tim Allen  plays Jason Nesmith who stars as Commander Peter Quincy Taggart;  Sigourney Weaver is Gwen DeMarco who plays Lieutenant Tawny Madison; while Alan Rickman is Alexander Dane who plays an alien named Doctor Lazarus.  Each actor is fed up with the convention tours but needs to make a living somehow.  Unbeknownst to them, earthlings are not the only ones who watch their show.  A group of aliens facing imminent peril from their galactic enemies are desperately in need of help and, unable to distinguish the show from reality, hope that Commander Taggart and his crew can come to the rescue. What follows is a side-splitting adventure for the hesitant actors who now have to pilot the fully operational replica of their TV ship built by their alien suppliants.<br /><br />This is really a great comedy the likes of which I had not seen in years.  The screenplay and script is brilliant in its combination of both parody and satire.  The acting by every single actor was hillarious.  The only comparable spoof on Star Trek that I'd seen was on SNL when the Enterprise becomes a diner.  Don't hesitate to open all frequencies to receive this great comedy.</p></body></html>

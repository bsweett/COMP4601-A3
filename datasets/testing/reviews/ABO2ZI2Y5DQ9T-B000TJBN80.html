<meta name="summary" content=""28 Weeks Later": Intense and Emotional But Needs a Better Story"></head><body><p>The deadly virus "Rage" comes back in "28 Weeks Later," much-awaited sequel to the hit Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later." Though the basic rules of the film's world - zombies running wild, for example - are the same, the sequel has more actions including shootings, explosions and zombie attacks. The film has many plot holes and shaky camera works (and very shaky at time), but it is entertaining nonetheless.<br /><br />After the film's intense opening chapters, "28 Weeks Later" shows us the deserted city of London, where a certain area is now a secure zone for the military and residents. Selected civilians are allowed to return to England and they are informed (by the US army) that the disease is now contained. Of course it is, until someone, or some people, does things that they should not do.<br /><br />Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack appear (and they are both very good), but their screen time is comparatively limited. The real stars are no doubt the undead. The zombie attacks have become more fierce and gory this time.<br /><br />The action-packed sequel is helmed by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, whose unique thriller "Intacto" impressed me with its original story. Unfortunately, despite its merits (like terrific opening, impressive shots of the city's landmarks, etc.), "28 Weeks Later" sometime needs better plot devices than what they offer to convince us. I know we should forget such questions as "How can he or she do this or that?" while watching films - any films - but I think "28 Weeks Later" demands too much.<br /><br />Or perhaps I didn't like these two kids, whose actions play an important role in the plot. Here is a new perspective Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has introduced into the overcrowding genre of zombie films. What you do for love does not necessarily mean a good thing. Well, that is the only way I can think of to account for their presence. Or perhaps the script is not that deep and that new viewpoint is just accidental. I don't know. Anyway the film keeps moving, is constantly emotionally charged, and is never boring as long as you ignore certain parts of the film.</p></body></html>

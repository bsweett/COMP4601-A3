<meta name="summary" content="I am reviewing the special edition with commentary"></head><body><p>I bought this cause I haven't seen it in a long time and it said it had a ton of special features.<br /><br />Well I am here to tell you that the special features are plentiful and they are very good.<br /><br />The thing that i was dissapointed about was the commentary.  It is the director and arnold talking, and they give you some very informative info on how arnold financed this movie, and how minority report was originally total recall two.  But arnold ends up ruining the commentary for me.  he keeps satimg "watch, watch this, I am a woman here and my head is about to explode, ok here it is".  This goes on for most of the commentary and is really annoying.  I was at least expecting it to be funny because it was so stupid, but arnold is just plain stupid.<br /><br />So overall a really good movie, good special features, and an ok commentary.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Trek" at it's best!"></head><body><p>Being the first "Star Trek" movie I ever saw (and my first exposure to the whole "Trek" saga period), I can say that while the films that followed it often got to the plateau "Wrath of Khan" did ("First Contact", "The Undiscovered Country", for examples), the film series has not yet produced an adventure that has crossed it yet.  As the crew of the Enterprise face an uncertain future together and career-wise, they find out about an even bigger problem than all of that.  An old enemy, a former tyrannt named Khan, has managed to launch an attack against the Enterprise during a rather routine training voyage with a crew of cadets.  What follows is a tense cat-and-mouse game between two adversaries that will ultimately end in sacrifice and death.  Setting the seeds for future installments of the series, "Khan" still works as a solid piece of sci-fi entertainment.  This special edition boasts commentary from the director, a text commentary pointing out flaws and even trivia about the film.  The "making of" specials explain a lot about the making of the film (including the then shocking finale), the visual effects, and the costume designs that influenced the "Trek" films that followed.  All in all, a solid purchase for the "Trek" fan.  Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

The way they go back and forth with wit, humor, and a little bit of insight is like a play.  Adrienne Shelley's script is brilliant from start to finish.<br /><br />But don't let the DVD cover fool you.  This is not your typical romantic comedy/drama.  The cover might overplay the romance a little bit.  The film is about what it takes for one person to gather up the courage to disover what she wants in her life, instead of letting others do it for her.<br /><br />Jenna is faced with an abusive relationship with her husband, Earl, who makes Jenna promise that she love him more than the baby.  She also has an affair with her quirky doctor, who himself is married.  While trying to figure out what to do with these relationships, she gains a certain amount of respect from old Joe, the owner of the diner where she works, played brilliantly by Andy Griffith.  Throughout the film, he gives Jenna advice and undeniable truths she has to face, even though she wants to hear none of it.<br /><br />The winning script makes this film worth watching.  It's a feel good movie that doesn't slip into the pitfalls of the romantic comedy genre and has a rather unique uplifting conclusion.  Little touches like how each pie Jenna creates seems to be inspired by the moments in her life make the film special.  It's definitely one of the better films of 2007.</p></body></html>

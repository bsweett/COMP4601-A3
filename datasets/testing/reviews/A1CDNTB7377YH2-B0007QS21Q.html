Smith lives in a world where robots are commonplace, serving humans (reminicent of the 4th Planet of the Apes movie) as nannies, butlers, and general servants.  He is called to solve the murder of a scientist, who was his friend.  The only possible suspect seems to be a robot.  The only problem is that robots are subject to Isaac Asimov's 3 laws, meaning that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human.<br /><br />As things progress we also learn that Smith, a robot hater, is part robot himself, with some bionic parts.  As things progress we find out that there maybe the three laws are not absolute and there may be some ways around it.<br /><br />There are some fast paced tense scenes and there are some enjoyable supporting characters such as Smith's mother and the lady robot scientist that Smith seems to like.</p></body></html>

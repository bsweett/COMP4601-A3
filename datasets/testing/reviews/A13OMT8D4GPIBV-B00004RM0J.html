<meta name="summary" content="An Absolute Treasure"></head><body><p>The Goonies, written by Steven Spielberg and directed by Richard Donner, is a wonderful adventure story.  If you haven't seen it I won't go into it too far, but it's about four friends, accompanied by one's brother and his friends on a trip to find a Pirate's gold.<br /><br />Quite wonderful.  This and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXIP">Stand By Me (Special Edition)</a> are the essential children's 80's movies that everone should see.  Magical.<br /><br />As this is only a rerelease of the earlier version the features are the same.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

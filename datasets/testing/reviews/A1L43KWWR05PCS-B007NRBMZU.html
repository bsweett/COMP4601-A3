<meta name="summary" content="FOR THOSE WHO LOVE ALTERNATE REALITIES AND TIME TRAVEL..."></head><body><p>To begin with, if one is to enjoy this film, one has to suspend disbelief, as the plot turns upon the ability to relive one's past and change it. This is a film that will appeal to those who enjoy seeing films or reading books that thematically deal with alternate realities or time travel.<br /><br />  The butterfly effects refers to the chaos theory in physics. The bottom line is that every action has a reaction, often one that is seemingly unpredictable. That is probably the keyword to describe this compelling and intense film that is filled with complex relationships. Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), a college student interested in psychology, discovers for himself just how unpredictable life can be, when he finds a way to go back into his troubled past to try to right what went wrong with him and his three childhood friends, Lenny, Kayleigh, and her twin brother, Tommy. Unfortunately, the best intentions often go awry. Despite traveling back a numer of times into his past, each alternate reality has its own nightmarish permutations.<br /><br />  This is an inventive, creative, well-done film with excellent performances by the entire cast. While Ashton Kutcher gives a fine, sensitive performance as the angst ridden Evan Treborn, he is, however, outshone by the two child actors who play the role of Evan Treborn as a seven year old (Logan Lerman) and as a thirteen year old (John Patrick Amedori). In fact, three talented sets of actors play the roles of Evan and his three childhood friends at ages seven, thirteen, and as young adults.<br /><br />Melora Walters gives a well-nuanced performance as Andrea Treborn, Evan's mother. Amy Smart gives a wonderful performance as the adult Kayleigh Miller, a very special childhood friend and the love of Evan's life, who acts as the catalyst for his entry into the wacky world of alternate realities. Jesse James gives a riveting performance as the thirteen years old Tommy Miller, Kayleigh's psychotic twin brother. Look for Eric Stoltz in the small, pivotal role of Mr. Miller, Kayleigh's father, whose fresh faced looks belie a man steeped in perversion and cruelty.<br /><br />  Writers-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber provide a fresh and inventive script with labyrinthine twists and turns that, coupled with deft direction, give rise to a compelling, mind bending film that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. This is definitely a film that one will want to view more than once, as the DVD provides both the director's cut and the theatrical release and is packed with many extras. Those film lovers who have a penchant for alternate realities or time travel themes will certainly want to add this film to their personal collection.</p></body></html>

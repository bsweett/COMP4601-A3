<meta name="summary" content="Whose Planet Is It Anyway?"></head><body><p>In "The Day the Earth Stood Still" Keanu Reeves has four acting emotions: serious, more serious, almost comatose, and unconscious. He and other aliens have come to Earth to wipe out all human beings because they are destroying the planet. The human beings think it belongs to them. Well, it doesn't! In reality it belongs to the galaxy, and human beings don't have a right to desecrate it. Are they ever going to learn? These alien beings, morally and intellectually superior to Earth people, are on a serious mission.<br /> On his visit Alien Keanu discovers that humans can be loving and compassionate. Gracious! They (We) aren't completely hopeless after all.<br /> The special effects are none too special or eye-catching and seem to be recycled from other movies. The kid in this movie is really annoying. More of a brat.<br /> A movie with this title was originally made in 1951, and it was a landmark sci-fi flick, a critical success. This one is barely a footnote in sci-fi history.<br /> Kathy Bates is a determined and proactive U.S. Secretary of Defense. She's on serious pills too. It is not one of her better roles, and she could do this one in her sleep; in fact, I think she does doze off at times in this one.<br /> Army officers order everything but the kitchen sink fired at the alien ships. The "nuke `em" scenes seem to be taken out of the latest Hulk movie. These cookie-cutter scenes seem to migrate from one film to another. After you see this movie, you may start rooting for the aliens.</p></body></html>

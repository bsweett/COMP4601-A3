<meta name="summary" content="High Tension Deficit"></head><body><p>What starts as a really wild white knuckle suspense flick fumbles away its greatness by the time it ends, even if it seemed on track to be a five star scare movie. While I won't throw the ending in as spoiler, suffice to say that the final scene negates anything that would have happened in the rest of "High Tension."<br /><br />Yet this nationally successful French horror takes the usual slasher set up and uses about half its running time in a frantic cat and mouse game between Alex, Marie and Le tueur (the mystery killer). Alex takes her school pal Marie to her family's rural bungalow so they can concentrate on the collegiate studies, but a dark and creepy van pulls up to the door in the middle of the night. Begin the gory body count. Cue the slit throat. And check out that hot chick in chains. Yup, it's the return to teens in trouble that made films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIWAVW">Halloween</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C8ART">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a> into classics.<br /><br />Marie is kidnapped and hauled away from the carnage and it's up to the infatuated Alex to save her. Even though "High Tension" leaps around from French to English and subtitles, during the chase scenes, the words are more or less unnecessary since fear is the primary language. When Alex finally gets her barbed wire weapon and faces off against the psycho, you'll be gripping your armrests. Up to this point, "High Tension" had me hook line and....<br /><br />...stinker. The final twist is so amateurish and bogus as to rend your previous 90 minutes as a waste. As the cops come review video of one of the murder scenes and the twist is revealed, you realize that the total sum of the film up to this moment was utterly implausible. It was almost as bad as a forced Saturday Night Live skit where the just throw away the endline to get out off the stage. I've seen Scooby Doo episodes that ended more believably. It shifts "High Tension" to the realm of films for horror junkies only, as those with a passing interest will wade through the gore and chase scenes just to bellow WTF at the final credits.</p></body></html>

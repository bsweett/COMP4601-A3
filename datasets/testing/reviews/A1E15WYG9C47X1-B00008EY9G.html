<meta name="summary" content="Nothing is Really  What It Seems!"></head><body><p>Just think of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Negroes, Hitchcock's Psycho,and add Raising Cain to the mould and what you get is one of the most intelligent suspense thrillers I have seen in a long while, with a twist at the end that will truly shock you.<br />However these comparisons are more related to the mood, setting and atmosphere of the film rather than the content or style ,for James Mangold (Girls Interrupted, Copland) manages to direct  Michael Cooney's original script with his own undeniable touch.<br />I will not write a lot about the story of the film, since it is the kind that the viewer should watch with a degree of ignorance in order to discover it all by him/herself, and any hints might very well ruin the explosive end:<br />Save to say that during a violent storm a group of people become stranded in a remote motel,and soon enough they start dropping dead one by one in mysterious and sinister circumstances.Of course, nothing is really what it seems, and there lies a secret behind these deaths that unless you are a brightest of your local Mensa group,it will come totally unexpected.(Thank God I am not, and the ending blew my mind)<br />Mangold is an able director, and he manages successfully to create the right mood for his film from the very start and keep the suspense till the very end, with the help of spot on editing.<br />One aspect of Cooney's script which I found very well covered, is the fact that despite the relatively large number of characters in the film,each one (in varying degress of course), gets enough treatment to make him/her much more interesting.(Suspense/horror thrillers with many characters tend to emphasize more on two or three characters,leaving the rest not more than extras.)<br />The casting was made of fine actors such as John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Rebecca De Mornay.But, personally watching any film, I largely expect the big stars to deliver their end of the bargain flawlessly,and some names are enough to attract the viewers regardless of the genre, yet I love to discover the little relatively unknown supporting actors and actresses who give a performance as good if not better as their star colleagues. And surely enough, in Identity, I was greatly impressed by the performance of Pruitt Taylor Vince, notwithstanding his relatively short time on screen.He was the best thing in the average Trapped and yet again he proves that he is an actor of immense capabilities.<br />So if you want an intelligent suspense film, with a great script, direction and acting, a movie that you will think about long after the credits roll, then look no further, for Identity is such a film, a valuable addition to your movie library.</p></body></html>

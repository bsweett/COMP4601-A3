<meta name="summary" content="Pixar Does It Again"></head><body><p>Everything about "The Incredibles" is incredible.  The<br /><br />new Pixar film just released this weekend is a preview<br /><br />of things to come from the animation annals of<br /><br />Hollywood.  If you were entertained by such "Pixar"<br /><br />flicks as "Monsters, Inc.", "Toy Story", "A Bug's<br /><br />Life" and "Finding Nemo", this one is better.<br /><br />Animation has reached new heights.  I really don't<br /><br />want to give away any of the plot, other than this<br /><br />film is so entertaining you will walk away feeling a<br /><br />part of the "Incredible" family.  The casting is<br /><br />superb with the voices of Holly Hunter, Samuel L.<br /><br />Jackson, and Craig T. Nelson.  The special effects<br /><br />will amaze you.  The humor is side-splitting.  The<br /><br />plot is ingenious...and the music and sound fit the<br /><br />script and editing to the tee.  This one is destined<br /><br />to be a classic.  Wanna just be entertained and enjoy<br /><br />a popcorn night out at the flicks (without the sex,<br /><br />violence, gore and decadence of today's genre')?.  Go<br /><br />see "The Incredibles".  It is truly a "feel good"<br /><br />movie.  No questions asked...a solid 5!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The butterfly effect is all pervasive"></head><body><p>This is a fairly original movie that has several flaws but much to go for it as well. the story of Evan (Ashton Kutcher), a psychology student who discovers the ability to change events in the past, obscured by blackouts but revealed by reading his childhood journals is an entertaining, convincing plot with several interesting incarnations. Just as a butterfly flapping its wings in China is meant to set of a chain of results that leads to a hurricane in Florida, the movie explores the counterfactuals that can result from changing one event in history.<br /><br />Of course, this central premise (the dangers of changing history) is not original, but the movie is saved from cliche by several aspects. Firstly the ways in which the different characters are affected are complicated, varied, realistic and require some sharply changing acting. For example, the character of Tommy - warped from abuse by his paedophile father (played by Eric Stoltz) turns into, at various times, a psychopath and a born again Christian.<br /><br />The themes are disturbing and often taboo- e.g paedophilia and prostitution - it seems director Eric Bess wanted the movie to have a disturbing, frightening tone. Generally this works and the actors play their parts with sinister realism. This is helped by using different actors to play the main characters as children, teenagers and adults respectively. The best example is Jesse James playing the teenage Tommy with sadistic hatred. Stoltz is convincing as the twisted father and Andy Smart deals with the different situations Kayleigh, Evan's childhood friend whom he has a lifelong crush on, finds herself in with commendable chameleon skill. The main problem is Kutcher himself. He is not laughably awful as some critics described him. It is just that he frequently lapses into laughably over the top ham acting with a half silly expression on his face that threatens to drag the film into the realms of black comedy. Essentially, he is a goofy comic actor who makes a commendable but inadequate stab at a complex, serious role.<br /><br />I have other quibbles with the movie as well. The ending - a sort of disturbing antithesis to the message of 'It's a Wonderful Life' is pretty underwhelming and left me feeling that the central message of the film - that changing history has reckless consequences - had turned into a rather bleak and pointless message of the futility of Evan's entire life.<br /><br />But don't let this put you off. Many critics hated this film. It is true that minor details leave a lot to be desired. But the general tone is haunting, tense and packed with nervous energy and some good cinematography. The viewer constantly is on edge, wondering how the butterfly effect will take its next turn.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful performance by Norton"></head><body><p>This movie would not have been as believable if Edward Norton was not in it. His almost maniacal performance is simply astounding. You can see it in his eyes, he takes this role 100% seriously. It truly is probably his best performance to date and surely worthy of the Oscar nomination. I sometimes find him to be understated, but there is no mistaking that in this film. He owns this role and he is the reason to see this film.<br /><br />That said, the film itself is nothing truly innovative or spectacular, the subject matter isn't original or shocking, but it did hook me in regardless. Again, the acting made it believable. The prison scenes were an eye opener, thought a tad on the clich&eacute; side, but I couldn't help but be moved.<br /><br />The ending, for me, almost didn't make any sense in the grand scheme of things, but I think the director ended it exaclty where it was supposed to end. In my mind, it could have gone a little longer in regards to an extended ending. Actually, doing some research, I read that a longer ending was planned, but never filmed. If it was, it would have been purely for the shock value.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone that wants a good story with wonderful performances.</p></body></html>

An obvious point in its favor is the performance Meryl Streep who is infinitely believable and entirely owns her character. I say this as a person who knows nothing about fashion and nothing about Anna Wintour who may or may not the person Streep's character is a reflection of. Regardless of the veracity of the portrayal, Streep's work is absolutely amazing. With Anne Hathaway, she's an absolute doll for whom most men will find it impossible to turn away. She's quite charming and this contributes significantly to one's enjoyment of the movie. Independently though, I stand for any venture which accurately depicts what it is like to work with women. Yes, bosses like this one are highly unusual, but pretending that they don't exist is to embrace lies over truth.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Grimm Tale..."></head><body><p>2005's "The Brothers Grimm" features a host of talented actors (Matt Damon, Heath Ledger, Peter Stormare, Maria Belluci, Lena Headey, Jonathan Pryce), an experienced director (Terry Gilliam), and a franchise on the famous childhood fairytales, along with the CGI technology to bring everything to life.  The movie as delivered is therefore something of a disappointment.<br /><br />Damon and Ledger play Will and Jacob Grimm, two 18th Century con-men roaming a French-occupied Germany to rid small towns of their ghosts and goblins, for a price.  The two con-men run afoul of French law enforcement.  The local military governor (played with over-the-top menace by Jonathan Pryce), by way of punishment, sends them to stop a rash of child kidnappings in a small town, under the watchful eye of his chief torturer Cavaldi (played with manic energy by Peter Stormar).<br /><br />In the small town, the Brothers Grimm find themselves for the first time up against the real deal, an enchanted forest inhabited by monster trees and animals, at the center of which is a mysterious tower haunted by a long-missing queen. They enlist the aid of a local huntress (played with Amazonian strength by Lena Headey), who guides them into the forest.  The two brothers wrestle with the mystery of the missing children, racing the clock to head off a mythic tragedy while staying one step ahead of the vengeful clutches of the French military governor.<br /><br />The on-screen presentation is visually dense almost to a fault.  Scenes are packed with details, which creates a textually rich experience, but which is delivered far faster than the average viewer can absorb.  The storyline is also dense with allusions to aspects of the original Grimm's fairytales, which unfortunately have little to do with the plot of the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest challenge of the movie is that it can't decide whether to be a straight-up horror movie, a comedy, or some dramatic hybrid of the two.  The result is a frantic but uneven and often incoherent mash-up.<br /><br />This movie is visually exciting to watch; viewers with limited expectations who are fans of Damon and Ledger will find it entertaining but not much more.</p></body></html>

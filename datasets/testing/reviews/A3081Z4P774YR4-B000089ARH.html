<meta name="summary" content="In this case, &quot;Bootleg&quot; is better!"></head><body><p>Seeing as how I liked &quot;Almost Famous&quot; when it was in theaters, the idea of a longer version was at the very least a concern.  While I was sure it would add more to the experience in general, I did in fact fear that it would have material that would have been better off on the cutting room floor.  Luckily, this &quot;Untitled&quot; version was great, and improved on an already good movie.  The commentary with writer/director Cameron Crowe and others (including his own mother, no less) is worth a listen, if only to hear some of the details Crowe gives into the making of this film and stories from his experiences on the road in the 70's.  While the extras are sparse, this is of little consequence to my viewing experience.  The skeleton of this DVD set (the bootleg and theatrical version) is more than enough to keep me satisfied.</p></body></html>

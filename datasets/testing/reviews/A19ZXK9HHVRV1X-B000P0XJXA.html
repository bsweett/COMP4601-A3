<meta name="summary" content="is this a comedy or a drama?"></head><body><p>**1/2 After "First Daughter," "Chasing Liberty" and now "Spartan," it would appear that there is no task in life more challenging than being the daughter of the President of the United States.  All those secret service agents and all that media attention - what's a good, clean-cut, All-American girl to do?  Those first two movies were ostensibly comedies, but "Spartan" is a crime drama in which the President's daughter is abducted by kidnappers and sold into white slavery!  Hey, come to think of it, maybe this movie is a comedy too. Val Kilmer is the rogue secret agent who winds up going to Dubai in search of the young woman after everyone else - the First Family included! - has given her up for dead and seemingly moved onto more important things in their lives.<br /><br />As this is a David Mamet film, it takes us awhile to adjust to the movie`s pacing and style.  The plotting is complex and frequently convoluted, and, as always, the characters speak in mannered, high-falutin' riddles that often serve to diminish rather than to enhance meaning and clarity.  Still, it is this deliberate ambiguity, this heightened artificiality in the writing and acting that generally provide the major distinction and pleasure of any Mamet film.  Unfortunately, "Spartan," despite all the cleverness of its dialogue, simply can't overcome the inherent silliness of its basic premise.  The film would have us believe that the President of the United States would agree to have his daughter rubbed out by his political advisors because her rather footloose and unchaste lifestyle is becoming a drag on his reelection prospects!  Once we realize that this is where the story is headed, our patience pretty much runs out, and all we are left with is an arch, pretentious film that we find increasingly difficult to take seriously.<br /><br />Val Kilmer has no trouble getting into the Mamet spirit, modeling his highly stylized performance on film noir tough guys like Cagney, Bogart and Robinson.  I guess that "Spartan" is itself intended as some sort of homage to the film noir genre, but there have been far better ones than this in recent years.  It's true that when Mamet fails, he does so at a level much higher than most of his filmmaking contemporaries, and "Spartan" is certainly not without its assorted virtues and pleasures.  It's perhaps worth seeing if you're a viewer in search of a different kind of crime drama (and aren't we all, come to think of it?), and it might be better if you go into this thinking of it as almost a parody of the genre than a straight crime drama on its own.  Either way, however, be forewarned that this is not one of Mamet's better filmic efforts.</p></body></html>

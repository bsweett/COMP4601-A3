They're predictable; even the best of them (I'm thinking of THE FIGHTER) ultimately succumb to genre convictions.  Have no fear, however: MONEYBALL never truly does.  Because it's not a sports movie; it's a movie about sports movies, which also happens to be based on a true story of an underdog team that came up from the depths to take the industry by storm.<br /><br />Let me throw something out there, because it will become immediately transparent: with the exception of a hot girl in my high school geometry class, and Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, math and baseball are two of the most boring things in the world to me.  So when I tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed--and may even come to love--MONEYBALL, you'll get where I'm coming from.  Because it's a film about both.  It follows a general manager (Brad Pitt) who takes the advice of a novice scout (Jonah Hill) and decides to put together a team based not on money but on winning power, despite the resistance of his own scouts and managers.<br /><br />The film has an impressive pedigree behind it.  Director Bennett Miller (CAPOTE) has a sure hand; he knows how to create a scene and keep a story moving along.  The script comes from the likes of Steve Zaillan (everything from SCHINDLER'S LIST to THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO) and Aaron Sorkin ("The West Wing," THE SOCIAL NETWORK), who both know how to craft character and story.  But this is really an actor's film, and the lead actor here is the film's anchor.  Brad Pitt gives an award-worthy performance: subtle, nuanced, not necessarily the thing that wins Oscars but that deserves to (and just might; let us hold our breath in anticipation...or not).  He's helped out with a tremendous supporting cast, most notably Jonah Hill, giving a surprisingly straight-laced (though still quietly humorous) performance, Kerris Dorsey (grossly underused as Beane's daughter), and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the resistant manager who tangles with Beane's forward-thinking policies.  They help flesh out a film that would have been an interesting story, but may have become a big of a drag.  Truly, watch this film for Pitt's performance; stay for Hill's; and relish in a true story that manages to defy genre stereotypes and is, ultimately, a refreshing "behind the scenes" sports film.</p></body></html>

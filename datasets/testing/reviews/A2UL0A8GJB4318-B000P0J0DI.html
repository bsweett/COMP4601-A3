<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is Unforgettable"></head><body><p>If I was forced to give one word reviews of everything else I everything else I read, see, hear or play from here on in, that is the one word I would use for Clint Eastwood's incredibly compelling western &quot;Unforgiven.&quot;  To date, it is the most story driven, theme driven and character driven film I have ever seen, western or otherwise.  Beginning with an intense knife attack in a whorehouse and ending with a final, soul-wrenching showdown between Eastwood and Gene Hackman (who won an oscar for his trouble), the film never lets up on its sheer dramatic force or its provoking moral play on violence and its inevitable consequences.<p>Clint Eastwood plays a hog farmer named William Munny, now leading a relatively normal life after decades of being a feared and remorseless bounty hunter, with his loyal partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).  But Munny now is down on his luck, with the farm struggling.  When a chance comes about for a $1000 bounty put up by angry prostitutes from Big Whiskey, Wyoming, Munny and Logan take up the offer, along with a green but eager fellow hunter (Jaimz Woolvett).  Meanwhile, in Big Whiskey, the town sherriff, Little Bill Dagget (Hackman) has put a ruthless lid on the bounty, and beats up an old rival who comes looking for it, English Bob (Richard Harris) who by the way shoots chinese men working on the railroad for kicks and giggles.<p>When I first learned &quot;Unforgiven&quot; was garnered with best picture and best director oscars, I thought it had something to do with Eastwood being the old vanguard that he is and not so much talent oriented.  I could not have been more wrong.  Eastwoods' direction is outstanding, building scenes of dynamic character development with the hand of a skilled craftsman.  Every extra, every flat and otherwise unimportant chracter shows real, human emotion on their face, which is something I have never quite seen on screen before. Eastwoods' direction is aided by excellent, oscar-winning film editing.  &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is a prime example of direction and editing working off each to mold scenes of true power, and give the viewer a real sense and feel for the surroundings.  And the film is beautifully shot in the stunning scenery near Alberta, Canada.  Filmmaking doesn't get much better than &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; and Eastwood is far more than just Hollywoods' old vanguard.</p></body></html>

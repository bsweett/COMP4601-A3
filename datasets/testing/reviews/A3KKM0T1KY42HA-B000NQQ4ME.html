<meta name="summary" content="Apocolypto Now"></head><body><p>Long before Vietnam there was unrest in the jungles far across the Pacific Ocean in what we now call Central America. But don't expect a History lesson here, folks. Do expect an action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Apocolypto is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, and not a word of English is spoken throughout. There are subtitles, but I don't think that there is a scene in the movie where you wouldn't be able to figure out what was going on if there were no subtitles at all.<br /><br />Apocolypto tells the story of the approximate 48 hour period of when one Maya tribe clashes with another, and focuses on the effects of the clash on tribe-member Jaguar Paw and his family. The movie hits on all emotions, and is brutally violent at times.<br /><br />The key to viewing Apocolypto is to remember that the idea here was not, as I said earlier, to give the viewer a History lesson. The film takes a fictional, isolated, 2-day period out of Maya civilization and makes an awesome movie out of it. So the critics who were screaming "historical inaccuracies" and "racism" need to relax.<br /><br />At the time of the film's release there were some negative reviews that said Apocolypto portrayed native Mesoamericans as savages, but never covered and explained the achievements by the Maya culture in art, architecture, language, math and astronomy. Well, no, Apocolypto indeed does not really cover that stuff in detail....It's an action movie, not a documentary!<br /><br />Writer/producer Farhad Safinia (who met Gibson while working on The Passion <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHJQ">The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition)</a> ) said in a Reuters article from December 2006 that the idea of Apocolypto was "to update the chase genre by not updating it with technology or machinery but stripping it down to its most intense form, which is a man running for his life." And that is what you get....Apocolypto is a kind-of Maya civilization First Blood <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a> (1982) story that takes place in the jungles of the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula circa 1517.<br /><br />Welcome to the jungle. No one can outrun their destiny.<br /><br />Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but he now has under his direction 3 of the best movies ever made (Apocolypto, Braveheart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95">Braveheart</a> [1995] and The Passion [2004]). Apocolypto is one for the collection and should be added to your cart. If you dropped support of Gibson because of his recent public controversy, I can certainly respect that; I therefore suggest that you not miss Apocolypto when it hits cable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="LITTLE MORE THAN A FICTIONALIZED DOCUMENTARY ON GUN-RUNNING"></head><body><p>Nicolas Cage plays a Russian immigrant to the US, Yuri Orlov, who adopts gun-running as a way out of the poverty of Little Odessa in New York. Mr. Cage is always watchable and LORD OF WAR has excellent production values. However, I found LORD OF WAR to be little more than a fictionalized documentary on gun-running. That is because there is little plot and little characterization. Mostly, we see Yuri going about his job running guns and his domestic life when he is not. While Yuri must deal with unsavory characters and eager-beaver US feds trying to put him out of business, there is little conflict of the type that sustains a principal storyline. Yuri is not even really much torn with guilt or indecision about being a gun-runner. Actually, he provides the film's arguments in favor of gun-running. (Someone will do it. People are evil, not the AK 47s. Etc.) His cocain-addled brother and the director and writer provide the counter arguments, leaning of course against gun-running. I mean, this is Hollywood, which in no way is going to come out in favor of gun-running. But, surprisingly, this is a fairly balanced presentation of the pros and cons and of the reality of the world of small wars, where people need weapons. (Think of the Tutis in Rwanda. They could have used a few AK 47s to keep hundreds of thousands of them from being chopped up by Hutus.) I'll give Nicolas Cage and LORD OF WAR cudos for integrity and fair-mindedness, a rare commodity among self-righteous Hollywood types.</p></body></html>

The answers are guarded, focusing on the film's quality acting and cinematography. But did I like it?<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Nina, a 28-year-old ballerina who is desperate to act in a new and controversial production of Swan Lake. Nina is a shy, mousy-voiced young woman who rarely goes out and who lives with her ex-ballerina mother in a New York apartment. Her mom seems strangely intent on keeping Nina secluded, setting up the movie to appear as a coming of age drama in which a talented young person needs to break away from home to become a star. But there's more than meets the eye - there's something off about the way Nina experiences the world. Meanwhile the ballet's imperious director is pushing her to "let go" of her inhibitions so she can better inhabit the role of the Black Swan, the demonic twin of the beautiful and delicate White Swan that Nina can play with her eyes closed. The tensions between Mom's protectiveness, her director's haranguing and Nina's own repressed desires perfectly propel the story.<br /><br />This ain't your ordinary ballet story. It richly deserves its "R" rating for scenes of sexuality and violence, so leave the pre-teens at home and think twice about bringing the high-schoolers. But it is a visually compelling film. The ballet scenes are gorgeously choreographed, with sound effects added (needlessly?) to enhance ballet's silent movements. Natalie Portman easily deserves an Oscar for her performance, even if the film might not. She is the desperately shy na?f, haunted by visions and fears. The rest of the cast was wonderful. As for the film itself, I am torn. The story was compelling, and far from formulaic. The scenes portraying Nina's inner life - especially her dreams - are rightly frightening, disturbing and confusing. The Jungian theme of wrestling with one's shadow -- one's denied and hated side -- prevails over everything. But "Black Swan" really only works on one level - maybe one and a half. It is often little more than a story of a woman trying to break out of her own shell, one that has both constricted and protected her. The easy message - that freedom is always and necessarily positive - is belied by the crisis that ends the film.<br /><br />"Black Swan" is interesting, intense, beautiful and disturbing. But as being neither an allegory nor a cautionary tale, it seems to have nothing to say beyond itself.</p></body></html>

And they actually ran after their prey as opposed to ambling along like drunks, moaning and groaning all the while. But despite the prominence of blood and guts, the effectiveness of that film depended more on the human drama, centering on an isolated group of survivors trekking across the British countryside. For the most part, the same formula is followed for "28 Weeks Later," which is probably why it works. The only difference between the two films is that this one is larger, with more characters, more violence, and more gore. Does that make it an inferior film? No, not really--surprisingly, it remains on equal ground.<br /><br />The film opens during the middle of the original crisis. A small group of people barricaded in a rural cottage is ambushed by the Infected. The only escapee is Don (Robert Carlyle), someone the audience will have trouble labeling as either good or bad. On the one hand, the fact that he abandoned his wife, Alice (Catherine McCormack), and left her for dead doesn't put him in a good light. On the other hand, any one of us would probably do the same thing when thrust into such a desperate situation. It's all about survival; it's no longer about love and commitment.<br /><br />The story then flashes forward six months. The American military has since stepped in and successfully decontaminated and reconstructed an isle directly adjacent to London; twenty-four hour electricity has been restored, as have hot and cold running water and supermarkets (they've also reopened a pub). Fifteen thousand people populate the area, with more survivors arriving everyday. The two most important survivors are siblings Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), Don's adolescent children. They're absolutely delighted to be reunited with their father ... that is, until they learn that their mother is gone. Worried at the prospect of forgetting all about her, they decide to sneak out of the safety zone and pay a visit to their old house.<br /><br />Once there, they discover that their mother is still alive. She's then examined by the American military; as they feared, she's infected with the Rage Virus. Yet she doesn't show any symptoms, which leads Medical Officer Scarlet (Rose Byrne) to believe that Alice is carrying some kind of antibody. Could this mean that a vaccine is on the horizon? Maybe even a cure? Unfortunately, no one will ever know; a series of mishaps reintroduces the virus to the population, resulting in pandemonium. The military is forced to execute Code Red, which states that everyone must be exterminated whether or not they're infected.<br /><br />The rest of the film is effectively frantic and fast paced, focusing its energy on Andy and Tammy's fight for survival. At this point, Scarlet realizes how important the siblings are; if their mother carried an antibody for the Rage Virus, chances are at least one of the children does, as well. This is quite an interesting reversal: the siblings' love for their mother essentially made them responsible for reintroducing the virus, and now they may be the only ones who can stop it from spreading. This shows a complexity and depth that's rarely present in a horror movie, and it takes on greater significance during some of the film's more gruesome scenes. Example: gunning down innocent people proves too much for Doyle (Jeremy Renner), a dedicated military officer. In a direct violation of his orders, he decides to help Tammy and Andy escape.<br /><br />But for the dedicated Zombie Film fanatics out there--the ones who could care less about such complexity--you can rest easy knowing that this film contains plenty of frightening, blood-soaked moments. I'll be the first to admit that it's a lot of fun to watch; that's half the appeal of a Zombie Film. But make no mistake: "28 Weeks Later" completely avoids B-movie territory, allowing believable drama to get through to the audience. Even in the midst of violence, gore, and terror, the audience can feel the emotional turmoil toying with the characters, even the ones that aren't as decent as they appear to be.<br /><br />The film works in other ways, as well. I distinctly remember a scene near the end of the film with Scarlet, Tammy, and Andy in the London Underground. It's pitch black; Scarlet relies on her night vision scope to help the siblings move along. They try to avoid stepping on the dozens of rotting corpses littering the floor. The intentionally amateurish nature of Scarlet's point of view solidified the scene, allowing the audience to actually feel the tension along with the characters. This was the most frightening scene of "28 Weeks Later," and it alone shows that the filmmakers knew what they were doing. It's quite original as Zombie Films go, cleverly balancing sheer terror with drama. And yes, it also has a lot of cool makeup effects.</p></body></html>

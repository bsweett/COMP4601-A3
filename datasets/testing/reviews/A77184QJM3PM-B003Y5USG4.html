<meta name="summary" content="The Twisters are the Stars"></head><body><p>Kind of like in 'Jurassic Park', the actors in this film take a back seat(way back) to the real stars: the special effects. The twisters in this film are as close to real as movies can get, and they make youre hair stand on end just watching.<br />The story starts really well, with a flash-back sequence that shows just why Helen Hunt's charactor is so obsessed with finding what makes twisters tick. However, the story kinda bogs and drags after that, although whenever a tornado appears, the film just kicks it into a higher gear.<br />The actors involved try really hard to make something out of the weak dialogue they're working with, but the main reason to watch this for the twisters. They have a malevolence all their own, and seem to have minds of their own, as they chasedown the main good guys.<br />Again, not much story substance, but with effects like this, who needs it?</p></body></html>

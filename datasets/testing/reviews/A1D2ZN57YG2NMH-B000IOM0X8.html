<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Portrayal of Dirk Pitt (Although Not A Ton Like a Cussler Novel)"></head><body><p>Ok, so, admitedly, I'm a huge Clive Cussler fan boy. I've been reading his novels for several years, and love each one more than the last. So... I can tell you that this film is NOT exactly like a Cussler novel (it moves a little differently, the tone of the story is different, and Giordino and Rudi are totally different from their roles in the books.) I will tell you though, Matthew is PERFECT as Dirk and Steve (while totally different than Al Giordino) embodies the role in great spirit.<br />So, in short, if you love Cussler's characters (and the style of his action/adventure plots) but won't kill yourself over quite a few differences, you'll love this film to pieces.</p></body></html>

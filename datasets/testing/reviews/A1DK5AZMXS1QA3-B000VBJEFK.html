<meta name="summary" content="Another masterpiece from Pixar"></head><body><p>Many, many companies have created movies that focused on relationships between animals, people, and inanimate objects as key plot lines.  Most of these movies come up short as the interactions between humans and non-humans often seem forced or fake; examples include "All Dogs go to Heaven", "Howard the Duck", "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and "Cool World".  But Pixar has mastered this art, with classics such as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and now Ratatouille.  Released in 2007, this movie is by far the best animated movie of 2007, if not one of the best movies overall.  It features an original cast of characters that include a cooking rat, his clumsy human apprentice, the latter's lady of interest, a conniving head chef, an imposing restaurant reviewer, the rat's lackadasical brother, and their selfish, hard-headed father.  The setting is Paris and the surrounding French countryside, and the musical score fits the French setting perfectly.  The storyline itself is amazing and original; I cannot remember any other movie with even a slight similarity in plot.  And the animation is perfect; to see the rats move, the ripples in a bowl of soup, the flutter of leaves; all of it looks so real.  Best of all is the comedy, again a trademark of all Disney classics.  All in all, one of the best movies of 2007.</p></body></html>

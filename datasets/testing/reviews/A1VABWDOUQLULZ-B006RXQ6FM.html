Built on a fantastic cast, flawless direction, and sharp writing, Doubt casts nothing but on every character from the first scene to the last.  Excellent philosophical questions are raised, particularly when a student's mother brings a very unorthodox view to the fore.  Not a family film, but certainly a thought-provoking discussion piece on religious curiosities and good film making.</p></body></html>

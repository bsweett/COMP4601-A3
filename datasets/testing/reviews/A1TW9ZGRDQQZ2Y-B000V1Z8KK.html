<meta name="summary" content="Rambo: Part IV?"></head><body><p>I didn't think I would enjoy Shooter as much as I did. It is a flat out guy movie with brutal close quarter and various sniping action scenes, little importance in the dialogue, and two hot chicks in Rhona Mitra and Kate Mara. Mark Wahlberg fairs really well here as the Bourne/Rambo hybrid. He has come a long way since Planet of the Apes. Shooter might not be brain food, but I had a fun time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not as Good as the Original "Fog""></head><body><p>As far as remakes goes, this new rendition of John Carpenter's classic 1980 original falls far short in terms of both acting and plot.<br /><br />The basic plot remains the same. A ship of lepers was betrayed by the town of Antonio Bay's founding fathers 100 years earlier.  Their ship was set afire, dooming everyone on board.  Now, the ghosts of those souls have come to take their revenge against the people of Antonio Bay.  Hidden within the fog, the ghosts begin their search for the descendants of those who killed them a century earlier.<br /><br />In this movie, Tom Welling stars as Nick Carter, the owner of the "Seagrass", a small fishing boat that Nick and his friend Spooner (DeRay Davis) use to take fishermen and young girls for trips on the water.  It is during one of these excursions that Spooner and two young girls discover the fog and the secrets that it contains.<br /><br />Maggie Grace stars as Nick's girlfriend Elizabeth Williams.  She's been away for six months, and since returning to Antonio Bay, she's had recurring nightmares about drowning.  Were these just dreams or a premonition of things to come?<br /><br />Selma Blair stars as Stevie Wayne, Adrienne Barbeau's role in the original film.  Stevie owns a lighthouse with a radio station located inside.  Stevie, along with her young son Andy, will have to draw on their inner strength later in the movie to face the mysterious fog.<br /><br />Finally, Adrian Hough stars as Father Malone, the hard-drinking priest of the local parish who is hiding a mortal secret from everyone; Father Malone's ancestor was one of the ones who burned the ship containing the lepers.<br /><br />Sometimes, remakes turn out to be as good as the original film, while other times, the remake just doesn't measure up.  This is one of the times that the original is far better than the remake.  I found the story in this movie much harder to follow.  Although the general plot remained similiar with the story of the lepers, there were some instances in this movie I had a hard time following, such as Elizabeth's dreams, and her unlikely ending at the end of the movie.  Also, I felt Stevie Wayne's role in this movie was totally different from the original.<br /><br />This movie is ok, but it doesn't rate anywhere near the first film.  If given a choice between the original and the remake, I would choose the original, with its excellent cast of Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Hal Holbrook.  True horror movie fans may find this movie worthwhile, but its just not as good as the first one was.</p></body></html>

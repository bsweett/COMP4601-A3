Lecter has been in hiding, taking on a new identity, but someone has found him. This leads to a cat-and-mouse game in the streets of Rome. Meanwhile, agent Starling (Julianne Moore) continues her search for everyone's favorite cannibal. Mr. Lecter has troubles of his own this time, as a strange billionaire (Gary Oldman) will pay any price to locate and abduct him. With so much going on, HANNIBAL is never boring! A wonderfully gruesome sequel...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="When Tradition and Duty Aren't Enough--A Smart Retelling Of Modern History"></head><body><p>"The Queen" is an absolutely captivating bit of modern history--one told with much restraint and nuance.  Director Stephen Frears has taken a potentially controversial subject--and instead of playing up the unsavory aspects, going for easy emotion, or turning it into a melodrama--he has crafted an intelligent study of tradition, duty and obligation.  This is a complicated look into a tragedy that had no precedent but ultimately redefined much of modern England.<br /><br />Initially, as we meet the Royal family--we see that protocol, rules and tradition dictate their lives.  Every meeting, every meal, every interaction has a designated way of being conducted.  This is simply the way things are handled, how they've always been handled and how they are supposed to be handled.  The death of Princess Diana was not something that could ultimately fit within these prescribed dictates.<br /><br />Diana, who was divorced form Charles, was no longer a member of the Royal family.  In fact, she was seeing someone else.  Creating much publicity and speaking openly against the monarchy and for reform, she was a nuisance that had to be addressed frequently.  The family, upon hearing of her death, were concerned with the children naturally--but gave little thought to anything else.  They felt Diana's death was a private matter for her family.  The Queen followed appropriate protocol at all times.<br /><br />The public never saw that distinction, however--and that's the heart of the picture.  Tony Blair, the new prime Minister, correctly gauges the sorrow of the nation.  And the drama of the film comes from seeing the Queen recognize just how beloved Diana was, and seeing her people turn on her.  She must compromise her values and beliefs to placate the country.  She questions what she has always known, and her own validity.  It's may be an unsympathetic outward appearance, but every concession takes it's toll on the very foundation of her world.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is simply stunning as the Queen.  Regal and unflinching, she is also deeply human.  Betrayed by the very country she has dedicated her life to, there are glimmers of real heartbreak.  But she never loses control--this isn't an emotional performance--it's restrained and skillfully underplayed.  And there is a surprising amount of humor to this portrait of Elizabeth.  Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is also exemplary.  He is the film's heart and passion and it's a star-making performance.<br /><br />Somehow, "The Queen" gets you to understand and empathize with every side of this tragedy.  It's greatest asset is its evenhandedness and fairness, and I recommend this as an insightful telling of a history stilled lodged in our memories.  KGHarris, 10/06.</p></body></html>

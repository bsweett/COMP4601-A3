Jessica Alba is pretty much the glue for it to work.<br />The casting of the plastic geek and the villain might have been reversed to effect a better movie?<br />Whatever, I like it. I'd like more like these and the X-men series.<br />Let's see we have:<br />Superman<br />Batman<br />Green Arrow<br />Spiderman<br />Hellboy<br />The Hulk<br />X-men<br />Fantastic Four<br />Flash Gordon<br />The Phantom<br />and Popeye...<br />I've probably left out a few too.<br />Comic are big movie business.</p></body></html>

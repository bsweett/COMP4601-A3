One of the worst movies of the year, and probably the worst flick Kidman's ex ever made.<br /><br />It's no wonder it came and went in a week in the local cinemas. Pick up "The Replacement Killers" or "The Big Hit" - even "Grosse Point Blank" (or all three!), but don't get this bomb. Save the money.</p></body></html>

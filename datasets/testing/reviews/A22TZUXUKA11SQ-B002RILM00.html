<meta name="summary" content="Unbelievably, spectacularly bad. You have to see for yourself."></head><body><p>Nicholas Cage stars as Edward Malus, a California police officer who goes on a leave of absence after witnessing a tragedy on the job.  Taking pills to soothe the effects of his post-traumatic stress disorder, Edward is in a weak place when he receives a letter from his ex-fiance, Willow, requesting his assistance in finding her missing child.  She bids him come to Summerisle, a small island off the coast of Puget Sound, and help her find her daughter, Rowan.<br /><br />When Edward first arrives it's clear that Summerisle isn't like other places. Quite frankly, it's the land that time forgot.  The women dress like pioneers and the men--well... there don't appear to be many men around.  When Edward starts investigating Rowan's disappearance, he hears a different story depending on who he speaks to.  Rowan is either: not even Willow's daughter, nonexistent, dead, or soon to die.  Refusing to give up, Edward delves deeper into this strange community shrouded in mystery, secrecy, and deception.<br /><br />The Wicker Man is not for those who can't tolerate trash, as is pretty obvious from the other reviews.  I, however, revel in how far a movie can go in its efforts to be different. And different is putting it mildly where The Wicker Man is concerned.  Also, for those who can't stand needless violence, at least three women were punched in the face over the course of this movie. Furthermore, there is a scene toward the end when everyone in the village is dressed in animal costumes that made me think I might have stumbled upon an acid trip gone wrong. You've been warned.<br /><br />It's difficult to put into words how spectacularly bad this film is.  I honestly think you should see for yourself.  Not for full price, mind you, but at a matinee or second-run theater.  It's worth it for the experience of wondering if you could actually be watching something so completely out of touch with reality.</p></body></html>

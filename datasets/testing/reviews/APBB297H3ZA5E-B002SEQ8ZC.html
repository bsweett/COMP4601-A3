<meta name="summary" content="Forget the hype; this is a dud for all ages"></head><body><p>1. Supposedly this is supposed to be a "nontraditional" animated film... which it is.  Unfortunately, it's also a very lousy film.  First of all, it's not for kids; it's dark, it has a sarcastic view of the world, it's scary at times and it's definitely not funny.  2nd of all, it's not going to appeal to any human being of any age range, largely for the afore mentioned reasons and also because the whole plot is strange, although understandable.<br /><br />2. Again, with many films and art in general, if one wants to delude themselves that they can appreciate "higher art", then go ahead, but for the average Mr and Mrs America + 2 kids etc... do yourself a favor and skip this dud.</p></body></html>

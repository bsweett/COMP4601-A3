<meta name="summary" content="5 stars for each movie makes 15 stars"></head><body><p>There is no doubt about it these were sensational movies.Michael.J.Fox and Christopher Lloyd were brilliant here.<br />Often people will tell me that the 1st one is their fav.<br />But the 2nd and 3rd are not far behind.<br />The additional features on this triology are second to none.<br />Surely everyone knows the plot.But for those who have eather been living on a different planet,or somehow havnt seen any of these,lets have a quick run through<br />Marty McFly is a school boy and his friend Doc Brown invents a time machine.He uses a Delorian which when it reaches 88 miles per hour zaps into the time of your choice.<br />Thomas.F.Wilson plays a brilliant part as the baddie called Biff.In the 2nd movie he plays Griff and in the 3rd movie he plays Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.He was supurb in each of his characters,and in my opinion often gets forgotten as someone who<br />played their part so well.<br />Ive watched these movies countless times.They are the sort of movies you dont get sick of.<br />Michael.J.Fox's sense of humor in this triology is hillarious,but also believable.<br />You can tell how well thought out these movies were.One of the special features tells you things about the movies you never knew.<br />Anyone who likes these movies should get this.The hours of extras should keep you busy,so you can relive the magic over and over.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Super, Wicked, Bad-Ass, Awesome, "Incredibles""></head><body><p>"That was so..., WICKED!!" - the kid next door comments on his neighbors' version of neighborhood crimewatch law enforcement in "The Incredibles"<br /><br />One of the great films of 2004 is all animation and all kick-ass. No, its not "Shrek 2".<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is a great family film that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />This is also, & surprisingly, one of those films that you should see on the big screen & not on home video.<br /><br />Everyone knows what a superhero is. But, after saving a creep from his suicide attempt, Mr. Incredible & his fellow league of superheros are band by the Government from donning there supersuits & saving innocent citizens, forcing them to live, eternally, as there secret identities. This is only, of course, after the suicide creep wins a victorious lawsuit against Incredible for injuries in the rescue, as well as, invading the creep's privacy.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible still saves the day, only now as an insurance claims adjustor, saving the city's people, one claim at a time. His wife, Helen, aka, Elasti-Girl, plays housewife to her & Incredible's three kids, Dash, a youngster who lives up to his name, Violet, the troubled teen who can dissapear at will, & Jack-Jack, the youngest family member with powers that are, well, mixed to say the least.<br /><br />Basically, its the not-so Fantastic Five & a ho-hum life, with Mr.Incredible yearning for the hero fighting days of old, Helen reminding him to live in & get used to the now, & breaking up the regular fighting between Violet & Dash, if they could just catch either one of them.<br /><br />Things start to pick up when a secret transmission message is found in Incredible's work briefcase telling him that there is a secret mission for him if he wants it & the reward is triple his usual yearly income, if he decides to take it.<br /><br />What Mr. Incredible doesn't know is that sinister forces are at work and its all a trap, led by a youngster who is Incredible's #1 fan.<br /><br />I was constantly reminded throughout most of this year that this movie was coming to theatres on Nov. 5, 2004, thanks to the trailer that you can not avoid on the "Finding Nemo" DVD. But, it was well worth the pay off (the film will probably be the big movie for the Xmas season right along with "The Polar Express").<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is basically, bits of the Marvel Comic "The Fantastic Four" with a dash of Disney, with PIXAR animation & humor. All of the characters are great and well thought-out.<br /><br />The animation is top notch with new advances that leap off the screen (especially, during the action sequences).<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if "The Incredibles" walked off with the best animated film Oscar of '04.<br /><br />Its that good.</p></body></html>

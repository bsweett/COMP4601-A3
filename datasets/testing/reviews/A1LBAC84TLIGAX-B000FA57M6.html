<meta name="summary" content="A BLATANT HACK-JOB VERSION OF RESIDENT EVIL  7.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>I must admit, Doom had much more potential to be a movie than most other games. It's not that it's bad, there still good to be had, but it just could have done so much more. I love the original Doom for SNES and PC, but the movie borrows too much from the first Resident Evil movie and doesn't really capture the spirit of the classic game. Not to mention the fact that I did not know that I would be stamping this film as the 18th zombie I've watched.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A team of marines are sent to Mars to investigate a distress call put out from a remote research center on the planet called the Olduvai Research Station. Strange things begin happening; scientists are dead, terrifying creatures lurk in the dark and wait to eat and infect the soldiers, all while trying to figure out what Chromosome-24 does to the human body when injected into the system. The storyline just isn't that great, it borrows pages from the first Resident Evil movie, only Resident Evil told its story in a much better fashion in every single way and it was more explanatory.<br />GORE FACTOR: Limb-ripping, flesh eating, and even some chainsaw action, but there is very little present most of the time.<br />MUSIC: Why is this music even here? It sucks! There is not much present, and it doesn't fit the themes of the movie.<br />SCARE FACTOR: You will mostly end up laughing at its attempt to be scary, because it is not scary at all. The creature designs sure look great though, and seem to follow the game.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: You will mostly find it to be comedic, even though it is unintentional. Certain action scenes are quite entertaining, while others are just downright stupid. For example: The fight scene at the end of the movie. It's like watching a freaking Jean Claude Van Damme movie for Godsake (UUUUGGGGHHHHH.....). It does a decent job of ripping off Resident Evil, but it just doesn't really follow the spirit of the awesome game.<br />OVERALL: It's worth a rental, maybe even a buy if you're interested enough. Just don't expect to be wowed by anything.<br />THE GOOD: Decent gore, decent ripping off of the first Resident Evil movie, and it's funny.<br />THE BAD: Doesn't really follow the spirit of the game, music is awful, and the movie is unintentionally funny.</p></body></html>

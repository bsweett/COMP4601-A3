Considering the whithering criticism the film received I didn't think that would be the wrong idea.  However, this move turned out to be quite good and really a lot of fun.  Granted, this film is not high art, but then neither are Cussler's novels.  Moreover, since when does a movie have to be high art in order to be good?  Matthew McConaughey is great as the adventurous Dirk Pitt, Steve Zahn is hilarious as the comic relief, and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz holds her own with a bunch butt-kicking guys.  The story does stretch the imagination, but that's also part of the fun.  For anyone looking for a great time and fun movie, Sahara is the choice.</p></body></html>

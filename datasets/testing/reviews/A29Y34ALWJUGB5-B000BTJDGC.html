It's based on true-life events, and it's also a faithed-based horror movie that draws on our own, deep-rooted beliefs in God and the devil, something that has always found success in the movies, starting back with the original horror classic The Exorcist. Though it is a movie about the tragic events of a young girl who was obviously tortured in life, The Exorcism of Emily Rose captures everything that modern horror films don't. Simply speaking, it scares us. And it handles Emily Rose's story sensitively, without making her appear as no more than a Hollywood monster, like Linda Blair's character has become. With that out of the way, I will go onto the review.<br /><br />Exorcism begins "in media res" (beginning in the middle), starting the movie with Emily's death. It's a good start to the movie, because it introduces the other main character in the process, Father Moore, the priest who watched over Emily and attempted the only exorcism. From there, the movie becomes a court trial, literally. Emily's story is told through witness testimony and flashbacks while Father Moore's story is taking place. Father Moore has been charged for Emily's murder, and faces ten years in prison. Though a plea-agreement was proposed, he refuses every attempt and decides that he wants to go to court, so that Emily's story can be told. During the trial, Emily's possession is detailed and played out, and we, from start to finish, see the things she had to go through. All the way up to the actual exorcism, the horror is really no more than a feeling of creepiness (at least for me) but when you realize what is possessing her, and just how outnumbered Father Moore and Emily's family truly is, then it takes a violent shift towards horrifying. In that final epiphany, the torture of Emily and the hopelessness of her exorcism is presented. It doesn't take an understanding in Humanities to know who and what Father Moore has attempted to chase away.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, when all the facts are in place, you can't help but have a feeling of despair, both for Father Moore and for Emily Rose, as both of their separate endings were and are inevitable. Yet, in both of their fights, their goals are achieved.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie for fans of the Exorcist, or for anyone who has any prior knowledge of the Emily Rose possession and the happenings that surrounded her death. I'd even recommend this as a weaker companion piece to Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ, as both contain stark moments of pain and horror, and both can help us tap into our religious selves.</p></body></html>

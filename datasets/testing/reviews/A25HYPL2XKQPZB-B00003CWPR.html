<meta name="summary" content="What defines a marriage?"></head><body><p>From the reviews I have read, it seems that this movie is supposed to have a moral or a meaning, since Kubrick is such a great director.  I don't know if I agree he is that good, but this movie to me had a clear meaning and message.  Eyes Wide Shut attempts to explore the fact of how fragile marriege vows are.<p>I haven't decided if Kubrick takes a stand, or if he just presents this movie as a statement of fact, or a warning to be careful in a marriage, because it doesn't take too much to ruin.  Nor have I figured out a meaning to the last scene in the toy store.  But after watching the movie I came away with an overall message.<p>First, this movie has nudity, but like another reviewer said, it is not erotic.  It is however tragic.  The movie's message to me was this.  There is sex everywhere in society and you can get sex any time you want it.  Beautiful men and women are everywhere and society thinks nothing of you if you submit to sex outside of marriage.  So what holds marriages together?  Without getting religious or preachy, it is the commentment of the man and woman to each other.  The marriage vow can be broken by thought, such as when Alice confesses not just that she thought another man was cute, but that she would have given up everything for a night with him.<p>This devestates Bill, who in his mind sees Alice breaking part of the marriage vow.  He goes out for a night on the town and I think would have had sex if the circumstances were right.  He was willing to get revenge on his wife by doing something much worse that she did.<p>In the end, Alice and Bill are both equally hurt by the relevations of the other.  I think this movie is saying how easy it is to ruin a marriage through lust or adultery and that it takes a conscious effort by both parties to make a marriage work.  <p>Or Kubrick could be saying if you are going to cheat or lust over other people, keep your freaking mouth shut.<p>I thought this was an intriguing movie because I found myself rooting for the better side of each person's character to come through, and at the end it did, I guess.  I don't know really.</p></body></html>

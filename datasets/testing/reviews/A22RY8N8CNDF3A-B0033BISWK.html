<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing Sci-Fi"></head><body><p>The biggest problem with this film is its lack of realism. For example, a lot of the plot revolves around acquiring the space aliens' weapons - yet, they aren't any better than what earthlings have. Secondly, another theme is the 'rights' afforded to the aliens - eg. notification before they're moved, along with bending over backwards to not offend them, no matter what - to the point of ridiculousness. Third, the commander's choice to lead the effort - his goofball son-in-law - hardly one likely to succeed in anything other than getting himself and others killed. Yet, that would not make the commander look good at all.<br /><br />The idea for this sci-fi is somewhat original, and the special effects are amazing however gross and disturbing.  In District 9 the aliens look like giant grasshoppers, including spitting black fluid, and are attacked by humans.  The plot says they need to move further out of town and out of sight.  So a team of MNA officials go door to door having the aliens sign away their rights.  (ha-ha?)  Of course they want to stay where they are and fight humans scene after scene.  I don't think this is entertainment.  The movie also kept reminding me of the old thriller, "The Fly" where the main character is transformed into a fly. In District 9, the main character slowly turns into one of the aliens, which looks like a 7 foot bipedal grasshopper.<br /><br />A stalled spaceship over Johannesburg, South Africa brings aliens to earth for 20 years.  The film makes a racist joke of a segregated class (this time space alien)  living fenced off area outside of town - eating garbage is unimaginative.  This has been done often and in many forms.  In the film the slang word for "alien" is "prawn" - which is insulting to the aliens.<br /><br />An evil corporation, Multi-National United (MNU) is sent into District 9 to do evictions.  This makes no sense at all.  I guess this was something to laugh at.  The MNU goes to each shanty and knocks on the door asking the alien who lives there to sign a release, that they know they will be moved.  If they don't sign, they shoot them.  Huh?  The movie gets messy and messier.  It seems like the first part was more structured at least, but then the majority of the movie turns into a crazy fight that goes on and on.  Gags such as the aliens liking cat food, alien weapons can only be used by Wikus (Sharlto Copley) who plays the human who becomes half-breed.  Of course we hear jokes of making love to the "prawns" to start turning into one of them.  It also did not  make sense that the District 9 Slum was controlled by local Nigerian gangs.  Nothing added up other than more people to fight.<br /><br />So it turned into a generic action movie with special effects, some old jokes entwined, but not very entertaining, not what I wanted or expected.</p></body></html>

I have to give this film some credit because even though there isn't much happening on the surface in 'The Happening', it's an intriguing idea and I found myself interested throughout it's 90 minute running length.<br /><br /> I think most viewer's were expecting a different film. The story is fairly interesting, but that doesn't mean it's without it's flaws. It's not really as original as it seems as there have been tons of "nature strikes back" films and the performances aren't all that memorable, but it's worth a look if you have enough patience to sit through it.</p></body></html>

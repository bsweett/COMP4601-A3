This movie is based on Stephen King's story. Depp is a retired writer and who is also divorced from Maria Bello (Coyote Ugly, Tv's ER) who is seeing Timothy Hutton (The Dark Half, Beautiful Girls). At the beginning Depp finds them in the hotel. A stranger called Shooter played with real southern brass by John Tuturro (The Man Who Cried, Rounders) comes and tells Rainey he stold his story. Rainey doesnt believe him till he kills his dog. It goes on and it's serious this time and things happen and the end is just great. It has its moments Depp brings yet again another chacter to his bag of fun. Highlight would be of course Depp's secret at the end. I dont see why he had to have the braces. Charles S. Dutton (Mimic, Against The Ropes) also stars. Dutton also starred in Nick Of Time with Depp back in '95, so their old buddies. This will add good to my collection.

<meta name="summary" content="Not a legal thriller but a vengeance movie!"></head><body><p>From the DVD slipcover:<br /><br />"Clyde Shelton(Gerard Butler) is an upstanding family man whose wife and daughter were brutally murdered during a home invasion. When the killers are caught, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a hotshot young Philadelphia prosecutor is assigned to the case. Against his will, Nick is forced to offer one of the suspects a light sentence in exchange for testifying against his accomplice. Fast forward ten years..."<br /><br />This is the setup for Law Abiding Citizen, which at first appears to be another a legal thriller but little by little becomes a revenge film in a similar fashion to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQMAM">The Punisher</a> and the like. Clyde is out for vengeance and it is Nick's job to prove in court that Clyde is guilty, a phrase from the movie "it is not what you know, but what you can prove in court" echoes the conflict between these two characters throughout the film.<br /><br />The movie was quite entertaining and this is basically due to the fact that there are several reveals and twists that help the story move forward, Clyde's quest for vengeance is quite gory at times so parents be warned if watching this with young kids. Acting is quite good but definitely not the best from Jamie Foxx. Gerard Butler's character is written in a way that even though you know he's wrong and he is clearly the bad guy you still feel empathy for his cause, which makes him a very interesting character. Simply put, `Law Abiding Citizen' is what I would call a  popcorn flick, do not expect a work of art but pure entertaining, if you see it like this you will definitely enjoy it and accept its bizarre and bloody death sequences.<br /><br />The edition included in this DVD is the 109 minute theatrical version, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XMGGJM">Law Abiding Citizen [Blu-ray</a>]edition does include both the theatrical and uncut versions if you are interested in it and own a Bluray player. The movie is presented in an anamorphic wide screen frame of 2.40:1. The video quality is average considering this is a DVD, after watching it though I don't think this is a movie that would benefit too much in the Bluray format as it is mostly interiors and prison scenes. The same goes for the sound, a track in Dolby Surround 5.1 sound is included but there aren't really too many sequences that would take advantage of it. Subtitles included are English for the deaf and hearing impaired and Spanish.<br /><br />Several extras are included in this editions and are listed as follows:<br /><br />* An extra audio track with the audio commentary by Producers Lucas Foster and Alan Siegel (the little I could actually check was interesting, they acknowledge some plot holes they had to fill, production notes and the like so if you liked the film I would recommend you listen to it)<br /><br />* The Justice of 'Law Abiding Citizen'  featuring cast and crew and an actual LA prosecutor talking about the legal ramifications of the case the film's about.<br /><br />* Law in Black and White - Behind the Scenes  is a black and white piece behind the scenes.<br /><br />* Preliminary Arguments - The Visual Effects of 'Law Abiding Citizen' highlights some sequences of the film (which I will not describe to avoid spoilers for people who has not watched it) and the FX in them.<br /><br />Also included is The Verdict - Winning Trailer Mash-Up, the theatrical trailer and additional trailers for  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VECMAE">The Men Who Stare At Goats</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030Y11XS">Capitalism: A Love Story</a>, and Spartacus: Blood and Sand</p></body></html>

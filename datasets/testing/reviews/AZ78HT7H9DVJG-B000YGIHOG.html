<meta name="summary" content="a good zombie movie"></head><body><p>It's hard to like a zombie movie these days...with the exception of the Rage Virus series (28 Days Later & 28 Weeks Later).<br /><br />28 Weeks Later picks up about 6 months after the first movie.  The American military has taken over to contain the virus in Great Britain as well as monitoring the Brits to return and repopulate back to normalcy.  However, during the "reconstruction", there's a little episode in the countryside.<br /><br />There's a small band of infected zombies that have raided a small house.  In the small house is a family along with some other surviving humans.  When the zombies raid, family man, Don, loses his courages and escapes for his own safety, leaving behind his wife, Alice, and others to zombies.<br /><br />Don escapes to London to be reunited with his 2 children, who were sent to Spain during the initial virus outspread.  However, within days, Alice is discovered alive and brought back to London.  It is discovered that she has immunity to the Rage Virus.<br /><br />Don, feeling guilty, goes to see his wife at the military clinic.  He pleads with his wife to forgive him.  He kisses her and instantly becomes infected with the virus.  Then...all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the military must protect these 2 children as they may possibly carry the immunity just like their mother.  At the same time, the father is out to infect them.<br /><br />Fast-paced, which seems to be the trend, as seen in Transformers and Bourne Ultimatum.  This movie will definitely not bore you but put you on the edge of your seat.</p></body></html>

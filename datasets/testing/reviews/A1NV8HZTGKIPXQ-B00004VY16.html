<meta name="summary" content="Mummy Dearest"></head><body><p>This 1999 blockbuster harks back to the old 40's and 50's Saturday morning matinee serials. It also, and not too discretely, does the Indiana Jones thing too. The movie is totally cartoonish. Is that bad?. Of course not. The movie was meant to be a fun, entertaining ride, and it's just that. Brendan Fraser stars as our hero who is propositioned by Egyptologist Evelyn(played by the lovely Rachel Weisz), to guide her to the lost city of Hamunaptra. The City Of The Dead. It sounds charming. Once they start digging there, they find the mummified corpse of Imhotep. He was a man who was buried alive millions of years ago because he was sleeping with the pharaoh's daughter. Even back then men didn't know better. Anywho, he is revived by a spell Evelyn accidentally reads and all hell breaks loose. He plans on resurrecting his love, which includes a lot of gore and violence. He sucks the life out of the people who were there at the dig in order to be regenerated. Oh boy, there's always a catch!. The action scenes are fun and campy. There is a nice, quirky touch of humor throughout the film that is quite funny. The effects and make-up are all good. The cast is pretty solid, if not a tad mediocre. The sets are truly wonderful and are filmed wonderfully by director Stephen Sommers. It's a highly enjoyable and entertaining 'popcorn' flick that is only to be as such. The fun was sort of lost on the overstuffed sequel. Still, this is a entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

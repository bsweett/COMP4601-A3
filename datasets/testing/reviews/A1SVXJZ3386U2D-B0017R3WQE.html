<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing on Many Levels"></head><body><p>I saw "Scarface" when it came out in video some years back.  I had heard that it originally received an "X" rating before heading back to the cutting room.  I understood that the "X" was for its'violent content rather than for any sexual content.  I can't think of many films that faced that editting problem.  I believe I may have seen the original cut because a later viewing was certainly tamer than the first one.  There are many scenes of violence that are disturbing but the most hideous involved a compatriot, a chainsaw, and a bathtub.  I've never been able to erase that particular scene from my memory.<br /><br />"Scarface" tells the story of a man who will stop at nothing to reach the top.  In the case of Tony Montana (compellingly played by Al Pacino), the top is the top of the drug world.  He does a quick study in analyzing the business; who's in power, how did they acquire their power, how do they exercise their power, what are their weaknesses, etc.  The brutality and the "win at any cost" mentality of Pacino turns "Scarface" into a bizarre sort of morality play on the perils of ruthless ambition.  In its' extremes, the point seemingly is made; or is it?  I had put much of "Scarface" (save several scenes) out of my mind until my recent vacation.  I noticed, as I visited urban areas of Central and Southern USA, that there was a lot of "Scarface" related items for sale from men's clothing showing the sillouhette of Tony Montana to wall decorations showing the same thing.  Where is this coming from?  Is the message of the anti-hero lost on a subsequent generation that idolizes a fictional character who murders his way to the top?  Heaven help us if it is.  Perhaps it was that mentality that we saw in the anarchic violence in the recent flooded streets of New Orleans.  "Scarface" was a very disturbing movie that, I presume, was intended to show the futility of the violent life.<br /><br />In regards to the quality of the movie, I have to give it a fairly strong rating because the acting, directing, and writing is pretty good.  However, "Scarface" fails in quality because of its' "in your face" violence.  I mentioned the scene with the chain saw.  Probably equal in impact to me was a scene that took place at a night club the evening that Tony Montana was marked for asassination.  There was an act that was introduced which was the symbol of innocence.  You could tell from the audience reaction that this entertainer was a nice, clean, fun act and it was in the midst of his performance that the machine guns of the would-be asassins opened fire.  In the aftermath we see, in all of the death and destruction, the fallen body of this innocent entertainer.  The chain saw was about them; the entertainer was about us.  The chain saw told us that violence succumbs to violence; the entertainer told us that the violent in our midst makes us all vulnerable. The talent that made this subtle message apparently did so just to let us know they could do it.  Afterwards it was back to the same of blood and guts on film.</p></body></html>

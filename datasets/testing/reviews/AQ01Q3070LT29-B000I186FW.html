<meta name="summary" content="Very awful."></head><body><p>If no option has been selected in "Main Menu", movie will automatically start in 2 1/2 minutes.<br />  Evey (Natalie Portman) is a woman who must care for her "sick uncle". She is late and the yellow-coded curfew at 11:00pm has begun. To avoid arrest on the streets, she darts into a dark alley. Two men try to assault her. Just then a man in a costume wearing a Guy Fawkes mask saves her life. Now a hero, he aquaints himself with Evey.<br />  At her workplace, thos masked man known as "V" (Hugo Weaving) manages to intersect a videotaped meeage on every airwave and kills a few men along the way.<br />  Evey must stay in his Shadow Gallery for one year as his prisoner. He is not really a hero, but a killer who always speaks and acts like a man from the 1400's and continuly wears a mask. It is people of the Paliment and other degnataries he wishes to kill and destroy the buildings of importence.  He does have some good taste. He likes to play "Cry Me A River" performed by Julie London (Emergency tv series).<br />  Also in the cast: Stephen Rea, John Hurt, Rupert Graves, Sinead Cusack, Clive Ashborn.<br /><br />An awful film making you wonder if you are watching Phantom of the Opera or "1984" with John Hurt, or Perhaps Errol Flynn or Michael Jackson.<br />  Perhaps the Wachowski Brothers should go back to The Matrix.<br /><br />Disc One: Special Features: Freedom Forever! Making V for vendetta.<br />Disc Two: 17 min. Designing the near future.<br />  10 min. Remember, Remember: Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot<br />  14 min.

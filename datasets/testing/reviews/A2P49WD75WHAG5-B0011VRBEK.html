<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant master work from Park Chan-Wook"></head><body><p>Based on Garon Tsuchiya's manga, Oldboy is about Oh Dae-su, an ordinary salaryman type, who is held at a police station for being drunk.  Afterwards, he is kidnapped, locked up in a hotel-like room without windows, gassed repeatedly so the room is cleaned and so  he can get a haircut and clean clothes, and kept there for 15 years.  "If they had told me then that it would be fifteen years, would it have been easier to endure....or harder?"  His only contact to the outside world is the TV.  "It's both a clock and a calendar. It's your school, your home, your church, your friend... and your lover<br /><br />It's after being let out and into "life in a bigger prison" that Oh Dae-su's quest really begins.  Who imprisoned him and why?  He is given a cell-phone and a wallet full of money by a scraggly bum, then goes to a sushi restaurant where he meets Mido, a beautiful young woman who takes pity on him and takes him back to her place when he collapses.  It also appears he has been hypnotized during his imprisonment--but why?  His nemesis, a man later identified as Lee Woo-Jin, is quite the mastermind.  When they first confront each other, Lee gives him five days to find out the truth, or he will kill Mido.  If Oh Dae-su wins, Lee promises to kill himself.<br /><br />Through clues of finding out which Chinese restaurant provided him with the same potstickers he ate for 15 years, he finds Mr. Park, the owner of the hotel where he was imprisoned.  It is here that two memorable scenes occur, one a tooth torture scene where he extracts Mr. Park's teeth out with a hammer, all set to Vivaldi's "Winter" section of the Four Seasons.  Using such music in such a scene adds a bit of humor in it.  He then takes on a handful of Park's thugs armed only with a hammer, his fists, and keeps on fighting even though a knife is plunged into his back.  The sardonic smile on his face when he encounters an elevator full of thugs is priceless.  Guess what happens to them?<br /><br />The theme of revenge and Lee Woo-jin's attitude, "Whether it is a grain of sand or a rock, in water they both sink alike" implies that no sin is too small for revenge.  He later tells Oh Dae-su, "Seeking revenge is the best cure for someone who has been hurt.  Try it. ... Once again, revenge is good for your health."  But to quote Hamlet, aye, there's the rub.  "But what happens after you've had your revenge?  I bet that hidden pain probably emerges again."  The whole point is that this isn't about Oh Dae-Su's revenge on Lee Woo-Jin, but vice-versa.  As someone who holds grudges easily, I can easily relate to what Lee says.<br /><br />Oh Dae-Su's introspection in seeing who it was he had offended reveals that every life is far from perfect.  "Study your whole lifetime," he is told by Lee.  But he also realizes that his imprisonment has changed him, as he figures Mido wouldn't like him the way he was before imprisonment.  But there is hope for redemption, as seen in the scene with snow, symbolizing a clean new start.<br /><br />This was actually the second film I'd seen with Choi Min-sik, the first being Shiri, but so far, this is his master performance, a creditable and credible performance as Oh Dae-Su.  He later appears as the villainous Mr. Baek in Lady Vengeance.  Yu Ji-Tae scores well as the devilish but weak Lee Woo-Jin, and has a cameo in LV.  Ditto for Kang Hye-jeong as the cute-as-a-button Mido.  She is a TV reporter in LV.  And Oh Dal-Su (Mr. Park) plays the bakery owner Mr. Chang in LV.<br /><br />The movie's score is another triumph.  Whether it is the upbeat techno beat of the opening shot of Oh Dae-su grabbing onto the suicidal man's tie, the haunting quiet ambience during Oh's fight with Han in Lee Wu-Jin's penthouse, the Godfather-like waltz that is Lee Woo-Jin's theme, and Mido's sad theme with clarinet and strings, the music team scored a big triumph.<br /><br />This is hailed as the best in Park Chan-Wook's trilogy in story-telling, film-making, acting, and techniques.  One of the best films I've seen in awhile.</p></body></html>

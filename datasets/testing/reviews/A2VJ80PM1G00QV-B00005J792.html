<meta name="summary" content="An Odd Film but watchable."></head><body><p>I had not known of this film when I purchased it on the name of Bruce Willis. I suppose it warrants the characterization of "atmospheric" since in fact that is about all there is. Action plays a subordinate role to Willis' portrayal of the man with an itch from a source he cannot fathom. The Jackson character is given limited scope, inherent in its delineation by the film's creators. Apparently, this is to be the natural history of a comic book hero born of real, normal parents, living a real man's family life but alienated from meaningful connections with the world. In the denouement, with Jackson's hel, he finds that place. The ending is a distinct falling off a cliff, its abruptness being a let-down from the build-up and pinnacle.It is one of those endings which makes one feel that the creators ran out of steam and didn't know what to do next; or, perhaps, the financial chief said that there was no more money to be spent, cut it where you can.<br />At any rate, despite the glacial pace and lack of substantial characters aside from the two stars, and the role of Willis' son, it holds interest until that lack-luster ending.<br />Over-all, I have to fall back on the old cliche in recommending it, that is, it is the kind of film which people who like this type of film will enjoy. Anyone looking for a Bruce Willis film will probably be disappointed.</p></body></html>

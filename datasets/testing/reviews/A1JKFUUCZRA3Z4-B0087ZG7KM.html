<meta name="summary" content="Had it's funny moments, but in the end, was just ok"></head><body><p>This movie had its funny moments....like when the main character Annie is trying to get the cop's attention...and when one of the bridesmaids takes home too many party favors (especially knowing what those party favors are).  I also liked the message about not placing all men into one category.  Some men really do have big hearts....though I doubt these types of men would sleep with a woman on the first date.  I'd think a man who wears his heart on his sleeve would take it slowly so his heart couldn't get broken so easily.<br /><br />My main problem with this movie is that the dialogue felt untrue at times.  For example, there's a scene in the store where Annie tells off a young girl in a blunt way that didn't seem like something her character would say.  I also didn't think a guy would really be that blunt in bed.  And I didn't think the bridesmaid who stole the party favors would really be that aggressive with people.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love seeing inappropriate people in comedies.  They usually crack me up, but they only do so when there's a sincerity behind their actions.  The outrageousness in this comedy felt like it was trying too hard at times.<br /><br />I'm also not a big fan of raunch humor and in this movie, one scene is so over the top, I had to look away.  I also thought the movie ran a little too long and the love story, sweet as it was, was also predictable.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this movie had it's funny moments and it's sweet romantic moments, but in the end, it was just okay.</p></body></html>

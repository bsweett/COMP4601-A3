<meta name="summary" content="The superb Aston Martin DB5: A truly lethal combination of beauty and power..."></head><body><p>Although 007 is notoriously careless with the equipment delivered to him by Q, there is one item that retains a close hold on his affections--the superb Aston Martin DB5 entrusted to him on the "Goldfinger" mission...<br /><br />The Bank of England suspects that Goldfinger has been smuggling large amounts of gold bullion around the world... Armed with a bar of gold as bait, Bond is assigned to uncover the truth about the man with the "Midas touch."<br /><br />Gert Frobe--who had played a German sergeant on Omaha beach in "The Longest Day"--is perfectly cast in the role... He's an overweight man, but he's dressed smartly and expensively, and he has a certain lightness and grace to him... He's also supremely confident, self-assured, and resourceful... And even though Bond keeps thwarting him, nothing will shake his will to succeed...<br /><br />Honor Blackman is the first of a long line of James Bond females with patently sexual names... And ho could ever forget Shirley Eaton's introduction in the film? She is lying on a chaise longue on the balcony of Goldfinger's Miami Beach hotel suite, attired in black bra and panties, while she observes Mr. Simmons' (Austin Willis) gin hand through binoculars...<br /><br />The Swiss location shots add an international dimension to the fun with the chase along the overwhelming Swiss highways with the Alps in the background...<br /><br />With two immortal exchanges: "You expect me to talk?"/"No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" and "My name is Pussy Galore"/"I must be dreaming."), and with a fairy tense plot between a large number of highlights, and an expected spread of gadgetry, great women, and a menacing heavy with a deadly weapon, "Goldfinger" is probably the liveliest and most amusing of the Bond spy spoofs...</p></body></html>

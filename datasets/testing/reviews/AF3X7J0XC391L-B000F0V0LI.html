<meta name="summary" content="Classic coming-of-age for young men"></head><body><p>A classic coming-of-age movie, especially for boys becoming men.  Wayne brings to life Wil Andersen, one of his most heart-tugging characters as the tough cattle-drive boss turned father figure.  Through his example a rag-tag band of boys become men willing to take on the responsibilities of being men.  Some of the most memorable John Wayne lines are delivered in this, one of Wayne's less-famous films.  This film includes, surprisingly, some of Wayne's best supporting cast, from the boys to Mr. Roscoe Browne as Mr. Nightlinger and Bruce Dern as the longhaired bully/cattle-rustler who juxtaposes Wayne's noble character.  This is a film worth watching again and again with themes especially good for helping boys struggling to become men of character.<br /><br />A comment has to be made for the soundtrack as well.  The soundtrack is one of the most rousing and moving John Williams compositions and complements the film perfectly.</p></body></html>

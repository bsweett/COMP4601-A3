<meta name="summary" content="The Most Believable Love Story I've Seen."></head><body><p>Now this, as opposed to smarmy, Nutrasweet, cookie-cutter Hollywood gumball chick flicks is what I would dub "a real romance."  From the initial meeting of Portman and Braff up to the very last scene, every moment is authentic and true.  One cannot help cheering for them both.<br /><br />For a director, Braff's acting is quite good but few actresses are capable of putting forth a performance like Natalie Portman.  In fact, I can't think of any. She is utterly amazing and by far the most compelling character in the movie. Portman is an idealization of the pleasant, playful, penetrating coquette we've all read about but rarely meet.  Frankly, it's a joy to have  her on the screen.  I read online that Portman's father was a fertility specialist--I should say so! I don't know how any man could resist her, particularly in this alluring role.<br /><br />Garden State is a movie about love, friendship, life, and family and its effect is total gratification.  I'll go out on a limb here and say that this one's now lodged into my lifetime Top 10.  I'm shocked the cumulative rating is only four stars as I'd give it a 9.5 on a ten point scale.  Thank you, Zach Braff.</p></body></html>

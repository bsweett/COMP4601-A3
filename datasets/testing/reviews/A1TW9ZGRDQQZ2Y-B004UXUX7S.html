<meta name="summary" content="Memorable film with Clooney at his best"></head><body><p>I had missed this highly rated (by the critics) movie in theaters, so I finally got around to renting the Blu-ray over the weekend.<br /><br />It's mostly a sad drama about a man slowly losing his wife after a boating accident, but there are a few comedic moments along the way that are realistic, rather than forced. The writing and the entire cast are great. I'm not the biggest George Clooney fan, but his work in Up in the Air and The Descendants has totally made me a believer in his acting talents when given the right material. The girl who plays his oldest daughter is very good as well. One of the better movies I've seen in 2012 and worth checking out.</p></body></html>

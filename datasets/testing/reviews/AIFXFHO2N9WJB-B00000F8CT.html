Where the guys were looking for a good scare to get their girls to snuggle up close for the duration of the film, so they could show how romantic and caring they were.  Generally speaking these monster movies featured creatures that were merely actors dressed in shoddy costumes because visual effects hadn't advanced enough as yet, though at the time they were the best around so everyone thought they looked good.  The movies weren't really all that scary or even all that good if you really stopped to think about it, but that wasn't what the target audience was really interested in after all.  In 1979, director Ridley Scott ("Gladiator" and "Hannibal") released his groundbreaking, science-fiction/monster film "Alien", forever changing the dynamic of monster movies and audiences expectations of them.<br /><br />"Alien" is the story of the doomed crew of the spaceship Nostromo, who were heading back to Earth when a distress signal caused them to detour to a nearby planet.  When the crew searches the location of the signal, they stumble upon a field of what appears to be eggs.  One of the eggs releases its contents, which latches on to one of the crew.  Believing they can simply remove the life-form from the crew member's face without trouble, the remaining crew of the Nostromo makes the mistake of bringing the contaminated crew member back on board ship.  Though all efforts to remove the object failed, after a short while the life-form simply detaches from the crew member leaving him alive and seemingly healthy.  Believing all is well, they set course once more for Earth; however, appearances can be deceiving and the consequences of their actions brings about a horrifyingly deadly reality, as the creature that had latched onto their friend's face was only the beginning, and what it left behind will leave them all running for their lives.<br /><br />So, what's the difference between "Alien" and all of those other monster movies of the past, you might ask.  One major difference would be in the quality of the practical effects and costumes used in this movie.  Yes, the creature was still just a man in a suit, but this was different from all the other times this method was used.  The practical effects and costumes had greatly advanced beyond those early monster movies, so that when you saw the creature on screen you thought you were really looking at a living alien monster intent on killing you.<br /><br />In addition to the costumes and effects employed in the film, the story for "Alien" was so well-written, and the suspense was so palpable that you couldn't stand to wait to see what would happen next.  The direction by Ridley Scott was excellent for this type of movie, as he chose to create an ominous atmosphere, relying heavily on shadows, to serve as the main source for ratcheting up the anxiety factor that great horror films feed off of, rather than going simply for the cheap thrill achieved via blood and guts and jump scenes.  So when the audience does see the alien it is only brief glimpses, leaving the viewer to wonder just what exactly the alien looks like, which increases the anxiousness and fun of the entire experience even further.  Another excellent choice on the part of the director was not showing too much of the death scenes, by having the pain inflicted by the monster be mostly conveyed through the various characters screams of torture and agony, causing the audiences minds to create situations and scenarios far worse than any director could come up with, a method made famous by Alfred Hitchcock.  Speaking of the actors, every single one of them turned in excellent, first-rate performances, which is a true rarity in horror or science fiction films, which aided the film in becoming one of the true classics in the monster genre, setting the standard by which all other monster films should be judged.  The cast member that truly shined was Sigourney Weaver, who became an instant star and one of Hollywood's most popular movie heroines, and her character is the only one to be featured in every single `Alien' movie throughout the franchise.<br /><br />The movie "Alien" is by far one of the best in the horror or science fiction genre (it actually belongs to both categories), and the fact that it is still so popular with moviegoers is a testament to how excellent the film is, even to this day.<br /><br />"Alien" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

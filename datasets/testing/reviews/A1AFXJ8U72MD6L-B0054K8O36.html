Most of the old gang is back and this time they're seeking the Fountain of Youth but lots of other parties are involved in the mad race to this mythical location. Depp is his usual Captain Jack Sparrow, Rush is a bit more refined but still a rascal underneath it all and Ian McShane gets a nice introduction. Penelope Cruz may have been the weakest of the main stars and somebody should have given her some more practice with a sword because she just didn't look right. That said, it's a romanticized version of the life of a pirate so you have to sort of take it all in good fun. The tale was well constructed and better than most blockbuster films. Believe it or not models with natural curves were brought in to play the mermaids, including Gemma Ward as their creepy leader. The latter half was a lot more interesting than the first half. Inspired by a Tim Power's novel. Apparently it was Depp's idea to have the Spanish follow the protagonists in the tale but don't worry the writers did their share of the work. As usual for a blockbuster that does well the critics mostly slammed it and once again show they aren't in touch with the masses. The cost of this film was somewhere between 150-250M but it made over $1B at the box office. STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE (based on archetypes): B plus; SPECIAL EFFECTS/ACTION: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: today; OVERALL GRADE: B plus. BEST DIALOGUE: Jack Sparrow: [to Angelica] I thought I should give you warning. We're taking the ship. It's nothing personal. /// Angelica: You were the only pirate I thought I could get away with. Jack Sparrow: That is NOT a compliment. // Captain Teague: I heard where you're headed. The Fountain. Jack Sparrow: Have you been there?<br />Captain Teague: Does this face looks like it's been to the Fountain of Youth? Jack Sparrow: ...Depends on the light. /// Angelica: Admit it, Jack. You still love me. Jack Sparrow: If you had a sister and a dog... I'd choose the dog. /// Jack Sparrow: [to king George II] You seem somewhat familiar. Have I threatened you before? //// Angelica: I love you Jack [Leans in to Kiss] Jack Sparrow: [Just about to kiss] I have to go [leaves]</p></body></html>

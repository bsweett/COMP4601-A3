<meta name="summary" content="A light hearted horror story"></head><body><p>As a person who often enjoys horror stories its disappointing.<br /><br />There is nothing particular gripping in this story. The special effects are just okay as is the acting is on the poor side.<br /><br />The story seems to owe almost nothing to the Brother's Grimm. The<br /><br />Brothers themselves seemed out of place, American style con men in occupied Germany. The French soldiers acted quite stupid.</p></body></html>

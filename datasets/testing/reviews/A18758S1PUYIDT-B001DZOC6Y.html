This one really takes the cake.  You can't help laughing at the unbelievable dialogue which no one in real life would ever say, the not-scary plot twist, and the poor acting from people who would do better in other films and more likely with other directors.<br />Gather your friends, rent this thing, sit back, and do a total Mystery Science Theatre 3000 on it.  You will sneer, point, and scowl, but at least you'll have fun doing it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This Is One Violent Movie"></head><body><p>Sam Remi'es Evil Dead is a landmark film not just for its violent contant. (and when I mean violent content I mean it)But for its low buget quality, humor and apsoultly brillent photography. This film as set the standerd for all cult films. The DVD is good even theo I got the one that dosent have any goodies. The only goodies that are good is a brand new tranfer thats really all I care about. Because everthing thats on the other DVD you can easly find off the internet.<p> WARNING: This film is rated NC-17 for extremely graphic prolonged gurosume violence including A extremely graphic rape scene (by a tree) extremely strong graphic gore, disturbing violent images,strong graphic violent images,graphic gore images,and strong language. this violence is bad and this film is for adults only.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A splice of life"></head><body><p>Everybody already knows the formula. Everybody already knows it's going to happen. Pretty good idea of who the good guys and bad guys are. Yet some of us watch this to see if there's going to be anything different. Others watch this because it is the same and they can never get enough.<br /><br />A couple of renegade geneticists (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) crossed the line and splice with human DNA (Delphine Chaneac.) They pretend they don't know what they're doing. Just a little harmless investigation beyond what is allowed. What can be the harm in that? You and I know that how long does it take them to know?<br /><br />It doesn't take exceptional CGI to make this movie. The scenes were all shot in Canada, so there may be an interest in this movie by Canadians. The pacing is quite good; the spooky parts go fast and the anticipation parts drag out.<br /><br />Only subassembly race I can't tell you about any other versions. I did not see any extras but what do you need in making this movie. I would just chalk this up as a chiller, thriller, and filler.</p></body></html>

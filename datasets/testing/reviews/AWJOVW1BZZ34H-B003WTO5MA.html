<meta name="summary" content="More  Historically Accurate than the original"></head><body><p>I wouldn't call this remake exactly a horror flick, it was more of an interpretation of the real life story the original Amityville Horror was based on with a few scary scenes added to pay homage to the original film.<br /><br />This movie is really about the secret tension that exists in most families and how at times it can get taken to far. A man moves into a house with his new wife and her children from previous sex and they all seem to get along until a demonic presence in the house possesses him and encourages him to kill them all. The same spirit that alledgedly possessed a man some years earlier and caused him to kill his siblings and parents in the same house this new family now lives in. In real life, the jury didn't buy that story, but who knows? In real estate that say that location is everything, so if any of you are thinking about buying a place, don't buy a house built on the gateway to Hell. It's a bad investment.</p></body></html>

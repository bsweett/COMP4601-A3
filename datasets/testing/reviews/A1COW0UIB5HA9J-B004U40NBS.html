<meta name="summary" content="Solid psycho-thriller!"></head><body><p>Nina (Natalie Portman) is your typical New York ballerina who would do anything to be the swan queen for the big production of "Swan Lake". She gets the part until the original player (Wiyona Ryder) gets in an accident, after that she wants to be perfect just like her until a rival named Lily (Mila Kunis) pushes to the edge. She goes on hallucinatory trips that brings her to the very brink of insanity.<br /><br />A solid psychological horror thriller from Darren Aronofsky is one of his best movies and one of 2010's best movies. What really sold is that this movie is an artistic mind-screw in the tradition of David Lynch, Dario Argento and Alfred Hitchcock with brilliant acting from Portman and others, quality directions, imaginative yet disturbing hallucinations such as the cringe inducing cuticle pull sequence and a classical score to the soundtrack of the timeless classic ballet known as Swan Lake. I also like that it takes us on a dark journey into the depths of the subconcious as it includes a rousing girl-on-girl scene between Portman and Lily. I must applaud Darren for giving us one of 2010's best films.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives us very flawless picture and sound quality that makes everything look terrific and sound quality. The extras include 4 featurettes and interviews.</p></body></html>

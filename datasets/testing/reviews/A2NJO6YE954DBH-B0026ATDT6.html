<meta name="summary" content="One of the better giant mutant monster movies in some time"></head><body><p>The obvious frame of reference is to say that "Gwoemul" ("The Host") is in the grand tradition of Japanese monster movies such as the original "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA4TLQ">Gojira</a>" from 1954.  But while the monster is indeed a mutant it is not in a rubber suit, this 2006 film comes from South Korea rather than Japan, and the climax does not involve a showdown between the monster and the army.  That being said, director Bong Joon-ho ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XRZQK">Memories of Murder</a>") has put together the best good old fashioned monster movie that I have seen in a long time, and one that is certainly going to erase the bad memories we have of the lamentable remake of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767817478">Godzilla</a>."  The result is not perfect, but this one certainly has its moments.<br /><br />Supposedly because his bottles are dusty, the pathologist at a U.S. military base makes his assistant toss cases of formaldehyde down the drain and into the Han River.  A short while latter a monstrous creature emerges in broad daylight and starts scattering spectators right and left.  Our unlikely hero is Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), a Seoul snack vendor with a tendency towards narcolepsy, who likes with his daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung), and his father, Hie-bong (Byeon Hie-bong).  When the monster starts attacking Gang-du and an off-duty American serviceman (David Joseph Anselmo) try to do something about it, without much success.  Then Hyun-seo walks out of the shop and into the madness and in a harrowing scene her father is unable to save her.  Mourning the loss of Hyun-seo are not only her father and grandfather, but Gang-du's brother Nam-il (Park Hae-il), an alcoholic, and his sister Nam-joo (Bae Du-na), an archery medallist.  But then two things happen: the family is quarantined by the government, who are worried that the monster has contaminated people who come into contact with it, and Gang-du gets a cell phone call from Hyun-seo, who says she is somewhere in the Seoul sewar system, apparently being kept as a snack for the beastie.<br /><br />It seems strange to say that "The Host" will remind you as much of "Little Miss Sunshine" as it will "Godzilla," but when you have a dysfunctional family in a van trying to band together for the sake of a young girl the comparison strikes me as inevitable.  The obvious thing to complain about here is the length because you have to think that less would be more with this film running 1:59, but it seems that in South Korea audiences expect their movies to run two hours long and that is what this one does (it is the biggest blockbuster in South Korean movie history).  But on the plus side the computer generated monster is pretty impressive, and that is half the battle in a monster movie like this one.  Still, regardless of length there is something of disconnect between the set up and the pay off in this film, which, despite the predictability what with an archer running around an all, will surprise you.  This is a film that wants to work comedy in the mix, and while it often works in the end I am not sure if it was appropriate.  However, all things considered "The Host" is definitely worth seeing for fans of monster movies and may well become a personal favorite in that particular genre.</p></body></html>

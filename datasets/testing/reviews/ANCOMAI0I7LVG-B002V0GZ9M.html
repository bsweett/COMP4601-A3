That said film has pretty much the same synopsis or idea behind it as `The Lake House' with one major difference; `Frequency' actually takes the time to explain what is going on.  I waited the entire length of the movie for some kind of explanation, some kind of reason for the `strange' occurrences but they gave me nothing.  That's not to say that deep down `The Lake House' isn't a sweet little film, for it does have its moments but in the end it's nothing spectacular and definitely not the brilliant film some would have you think it is.  The one thing that this movie does have going for it is its two main stars.  I'm not a fan of Keanu in the least, I feel he's wooden and stiff and uninteresting as an actor, but here he comes alive when paired with Bullock, who just dominates this film.  It's as if Sandra brings out the actor in Reeves.<br /><br />The film follows Kate Forster; former tenant to a beautiful lake house, as she starts to correspond with its next tenant only to find out that it's not the `next' tenant she's writing to.  Kate leaves a note in the mail box as she leaves welcoming the next tenant to their new home and asking that her mail be forwarded to her new address if it happens to show up.  Alex Wyler is the man who receives the letter, but he's living two years in the past.  The two of them start writing to one another and eventually fall in love and want to meet but of course there have to be some obstacles to overcome first.<br /><br />I have a couple petty issues with this film aside from my big complaint about the lack of explaining the goings on.  I enjoyed the chemistry between both Sandra and Keanu but the writer of the script seemed to forget that they are writing letters, not talking on the telephone, and so I couldn't help but become irritated with the conversations they had with one another which, according to the plot, could have only happened if they were standing in front of the mailbox writing short sentences one at a time.  I know it's petty but it was just annoying to me.  The outcome is very predictable as well.  I knew the minute Kate was stood up at the restaurant what was going on (or what happened) but I guess that is petty as well since most movies nowadays are pretty predictable.  I felt that a lot of the dialog was cheesy to the point of cringing, but I get the feeling that's what they were going for, at least I hope it was intentional since it would be pretty sad if the writers actually thought it was good.<br /><br />Surprisingly, like I mentioned, Keanu Reeves is far from bad here.  He actually was enjoyable to watch.  Sandra Bullock is almost always a doll to me and so I really enjoyed her performance, although it was far from a favorite of mine.  Christopher Plummer is good as Alex's domineering father but the very talented Shohreh Aghdashloo is all but wasted here as Kate's fellow doctor Anna.  Other supporting players like Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Willeke van Ammelrooy and Dylan Walsh (Sandra is making her way through the `Nip/Tuck' men huh) are decent but not outstanding given their little screen time.<br /><br />In the end I don't know if I can really recommend `The Lake House' with a straight face.  It's not that I feel it was a horrible film; it just wasn't that great of a film either.  The script was interesting but leaves the audience hanging at the end, waiting for that climactic explanation that just never comes.  If you're a fan of Bullock's or (god forbid) a fan of Reeves then by all means see this movie, but if your looking for a really good movie then there are plenty of better choices ahead of you.</p></body></html>

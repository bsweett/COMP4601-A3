The movie's finale includes a fantastic sequence designed to look just like a FPS game.  Not to mention, having the Rock turn into a villian and the other guy become a hero was a great twist.<br />*The music score/soundtrack is awesome.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A very weak adaptation of the computer game.  The story line is totally different.  There are no scary demons and there is no Hell, just a bunch of ugly zombies on a martian base (albiet, the movie tried to keep up with the demonology by having people turn into demons; it is somewhat interesting).<br />*The movie itself has a weak filming style.  It is very forgetable (save for the last 13 minutes) and indistinctive.  I found much of it dull and boring.<br /><br />Overall, this is like a B-rated flick with good special effects and it just happens to share the title of the computer game.  I believed that "Doom" could have been promising as a movie, but this film falls short with its dull photography and uninteresting story.  Only the ending is worthwhile (and the soundtrack, if you like metal).<br /><br />The video and audio quality are good, and the disc has a few featurettes.  The unrated version has one or two extra featurettes as well (I'm not sure what makes it unrated, though).</p></body></html>

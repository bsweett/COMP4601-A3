Farrell (for awhile) does a great parody of an over-the-top Southern type -- the racing fanatic. He is egotistical, monomaniacal and 100% USA Grade A lunkhead. His wife Lucy (Jane Lynch) is a blond bombshell who is completely turned on by Ricky's winning. Best friend Cal (John C. Reilly) is as loyal as an old dog, and loves letting his pal Ricky win every race.<br /><br />But an hour into it, the the movie drops its winning formula and gets serious. Ricky suffers a loss and Must Face Himself. Will he overcome his desire to please his neglectful Daddy? Blah, blah blah. Half 1 had a good dozen laughs. Half 2 -- cliche-ridden and formulaic -- had none.<br /><br />By the time the movie ended, we were all involved in other things -- thank goodness for wireless laptops. Even the appearance of Sasha Baron Cohen (Borat) as an effete French driver was not enough to jack up this flat film.<br /><br />Strangely, the DVD extras -- with deleted scenes and extensions -- had almost as many laughs as the main movie -- even counting the borefest in the second half.<br /><br />An endurance test that runs out of gas well short of the finish line.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="John Carpenter Creates Another Great Movie..."></head><body><p>...and you won't want to miss a beat of this update to the 1951 version of the movie. While featuring some convincing performances, especially from Kurt Russell, the movie also draws strength from its quiet gruesome make-up and special effects. Indeed, this movie can draw some real chills from you.<p>A group of scientists in Antarctica explore a site upon which a supposed ufo crashed long ago. When they get there, they warm things up a little bit, and awaken "the thing", and from there the terror begins. As each infected being (or even animal - check out the horrific dog-splitting scene in the movie) becomes "the thing", the person it attacks or envelops becomes it as well. Now with this crazed creature, trust is a broken issue among the scientists, as each one fights for himself to the bitter end. <p>While not the scariest horror movie by any means, this film more than has the ability to scare you on its own merits. Be warned: once you have watched THE THING, you may never look at movies like this the same way again. Chills, thrills, and some spirited performances, THE THING is perfect for a horror movie marathon...be warned!</p></body></html>

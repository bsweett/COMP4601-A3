<meta name="summary" content="Hollywood does good with this King story."></head><body><p>Johnny Depp, you just have to admire the guy.<br />He can turn any role into something brilliant.<br />He certainly did in this movie.<br />From start to finish, interesting, memorable, fun from start to finish.<br />The ending really didn't surprise me all that much.<br />I never read the story, but I've read so much of King's work, I knew what the ending would be halfway through the movie.<br />Still, it's a clever and twisty movie with the usual knockout performance from Depp.<br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Suspenseful Tragedy"></head><body><p>"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is the "Murphy's Law" of crime.  Every step along the way, if something could go wrong it did.  Two brothers plan a crime that nobody is to get hurt in - a "victimless crime."  Well, this movie shows that the devil is in the details and details snowball into a horrible series of multiple murders and a sad and unsatisfying ending.  Andy and Hank  (Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) plan a perfect heist of a jewelry shop, which happens to be owned by their parents.  They are sure a trusted employee, a lady clerk of about 65 years old will be there early in the morning alone.  It is sweet and simple, the insurance company will reimburse their parents, and they will get away with about $600,000 to pay bills, as they are both deeply in debt.  This ends up being a botched  robbery of their parents jewelry store in this wrenching drama.  Albert Finney and Rosemary Harris play the unsuspecting parents, and Marisa Tomei plays Gina, who cheats on her husband, Andy, with Hank.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>I never thought that "Meet the Fockers" would be as good of a movie as "Meet the Parents," but I still expected it to be better than it was.  The premise of the movie is good: Greg (a.k.a. Gaylord, played by Ben Stiller) takes a trip to Florida with his fiancee Pam (Teri Polo) and her parents (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) to "meet the Fockers." Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are hilarious as Greg's offbeat parents, but they aren't enough to save this movie.  There are a few good laughs in the film, but most of them were shown in the movie trailers.  "Meet the Fockers" also relies on more crude humor than the first film, which was disappointing and unnecessary.  I also felt that part of the problem with this movie is that the script wasn't very solid.  The plot was jumbled and kind of bounced around from scene to scene without direction.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of "Meet the Parents," you'll definitely get a small amount of enjoyment out of this film, but I don't suggest shelling out money to see it in the theatres: wait until it comes to cable in a few months.</p></body></html>

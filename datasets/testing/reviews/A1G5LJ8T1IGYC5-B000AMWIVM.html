AS THEY'RE TRAPPED DUE TO THE FACT THAT CHAINS ARE LOCKED ON THEIR FEET, THEY REALIZE A MYSTERIOUS KILLER IS PLAYING A VERY SICK GAME WITH THEM. THIS GORY HORROR FILM IS ENTERTAINING AS WELL AS VERY INTELLIGENT. DON'T READ THAT REVIEW WRITTEN BY THIS SITE THAT'S ON THIS PAGE AND DON'T READ THE REVIEWS POSTED BY THE REVIEWERS WHO THOUGHT THIS FILM SUCKED. THIS FILM IS VERY GOOD AND VERY SUSPENSEFUL. THINK OF IT THIS WAY: IT SURE IS A NICE BREATH OF FRESH AIR CONSIDERING THAT 70% OF THE HORROR FILMS THAT'RE BEING PUT OUT TODAY SUCK!! IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD HORROR FILM TO WATCH, RENT [OR POSSIBLY EVEN BUY] THIS MOVIE THE NEXT TIME YOU HEAD TO YOUR VIDEO STORE. BECAUSE OF ITS ENDING [WHICH I WILL NOT TELL YOU, BUT YOU WOULD PROBABLY KNOW IT ANYWAY], THERE HAS TO BE A SEQUEL.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="EXCELLENT MOVIE/Guaranteed to shed a tear!!!"></head><body><p>An OUTSTANDING film, The Green Mile, follows the life of a prison guard at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in the 1930's.  That life is going to change when a new inmate arrives and is placed on death row...<br /><br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, faith, friendship, and inner strength.<br /><br />Moreover, there are some obvious elements of the X-Files that can be seen throughout the film.<br /><br />Tom Hanks, Michael Duncan, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it is an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, The Green Mile is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!</p></body></html>

The first adaptation starred Dolph Lungren and was an awful movie.  Is Hollywood so desperate for material that they are now resorting to remaking crappy movies as well as classics?  Fortunately this version is a bit better done than the other, but it is still a marginal movie at best.  When the lead character played by Tom Jane is not getting the crap beat out of him, he is delivering uninspired dialog in a wooden fashion.  John Travolta plays the villian in his usual manner and has basically become a charicature of himself.  If you're in the mood for an over-the-top revenge flick, then give it a rent-there isn't much else out there at the moment.</p></body></html>

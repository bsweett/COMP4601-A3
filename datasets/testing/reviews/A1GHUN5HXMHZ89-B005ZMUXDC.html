Loosely based on the story of Rapunzel, it stays a lighthearted adventure that doesn't insult anyone. Disney is very much on track these days putting out the types of movies we all enjoyed in the past that you could take the family to see and not worry about obnoxious characters that set bad examples. My wife and I enjoyed it and agreed to get it for the children, and the grandchildren to enjoy. If you like the classic Disney movies you will probably enjoy it.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />Rapunzel is kidnapped and kept in a tower so that she may keep an evil woman young with her magic hair. When a thief climbs into her tower trying to escape the law he learns it is not wise to enter without announcing themself. Rapunzel strikes a bargain with the thief to escape the tower and see the town. As the thief avoids the law he does his best to show Rapuzel what she has missed locked away in the tower. All good fun as they are chased and make new friends and become close to each other. If you enjoyed this movie, be sure to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049GYXCC">Enchanted [Blu-ray</a>].<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

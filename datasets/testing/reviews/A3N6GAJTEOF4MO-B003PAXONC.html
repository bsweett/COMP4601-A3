On its own this film is a very emotional, intense, and at times quite a frightening movie that will have you thinking that this is possibly Will Smiths best performance to date.<br /><br />A cure for cancer is created from a genetically modified disease, but this cure turns into an infection of its own and soon spreads across the world killing most of the worlds population and turning the rest into mutated vampires which have fed on those last few survivors. Robert Neville is a former Army Lieutenant Colonel/Scientist who is forced to have his family taken away from him whilst he stays in the quarantined New York City looking for a cure to the mutated virus. His daughter hands him her dog, Sam before they take off in a helicopter. 3 years down the line and the human population of New York and possibly the world have died out and Robert is possibly the only human survivor. As he still battles to find a cure we are given an insight into how Robert copes with possibly being the only surviving human on Earth. He sets up mannequins in stores, pretends like their real people and interacts with them as if they were actually living. The Dog Sam is his only companion in the movie and we come to appreciate and love the relationship that develops between Robert and his Dog. One scene in particular that shows the intense emotion that this film reaches from time to time, is when Robert is cradling Sam in his arms after Sam is attacked by mutated dogs. Due to open wounds Sam is infected with the virus and Robert is forced to kill Sam. This, to me is a very upsetting scene and personally had me on the verge of tears, this shows the pure acting skill of Will Smith and proved to the critics that he was perfect for the role. The mutants in the film for the times that we see them are very intimidating and the chase scenes are quite intense and place you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Will Smith has always been one of those actors that a lot of people would doubt until they saw him in a movie or playing any particular role. I have to admit I had my doubts about him playing the last man on Earth and had my reservations about a film like this altogether as you would have to be prepared to sit through a movie with just the one human character on screen for the larger portion of the film and I had my reservations as to how this would play out altogether. Once putting the movie on, my doubts were simply put to rest as from the first scene Will Smith enraptures you in intrigue as you're shown how the man is hunting down his food in the form of a deer. The action sequences are intense and all scenes featuring the mutants are unbelievably frightening, even more than I thought they would be.<br /><br />This is a genuinely great movie and on Blu-Ray it's made much better with the alternate version parallel to the original cinematic version. This is a gem of a movie that I think all Will Smith fans will adore and even if you're not a fan of his previous work, this will make you want to see more.</p></body></html>

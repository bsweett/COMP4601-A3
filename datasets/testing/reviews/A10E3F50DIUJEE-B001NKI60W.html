<meta name="summary" content="Another cute film that really only needs to be seen once"></head><body><p>I did enjoy this movie for what it was--a ridiculous, but good, time.<br /><br />The story line is ridiculous, the choreography ridiculous, and the singing, well ... awful.  Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried surprised me, but the rest should have been cast differently.  I know some people just love this movie, but I am not one of them.  I enjoyed it, but more so for the music. ABBA is great, and I know some people won't agree with that, but that's the point: to each their own.  The location was beautiful, as were the costumes.<br /><br />The story, if you have not heard it yet (or scene 30 Rock this season) is: A girl is about to get married, and wants to know who her father is before she does, the problem is she does not know who her dad is.  So she invites the 3 men her mother wrote about in her diary about the time she was conceived.  To her shock, all 3 rsvp to her wedding, and the slap stick, confusing comedy/melodrama ensues.  Fortunately for her, any one of the guys would make a great dad, and they are all willing to play the part.  More slap stick comedy/melodrama ensues until happy twist, and happy ending.<br /><br />It was nice to see this movie once, but I doubt I will seek it out again.  I think I will stick to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001DZO">ABBA - Gold: Greatest Hits</a>... or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0788814958">Muriel's Wedding</a>.</p></body></html>

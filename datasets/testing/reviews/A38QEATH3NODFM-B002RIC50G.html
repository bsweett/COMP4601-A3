<meta name="summary" content="Ok, a bit different than expected, a prequil that added some history."></head><body><p>I like the Silence of the Lamb series of movies, as well as the Manhunter movie. THis is a movie based around the life of the young hannibal lecter, a young noble from lithuania...who would have guessed it. It shows that initially his blood lust was out of revenge, and how it evolved to much more.  My only question is how did he become Dr. Lecter, because it seams he left medical school in this movie to go to Canada to get the "last man"  that murdered his sister.  Overall though, i did enjoy the movie dispite some flaws. There are some good Hannibal lines in the movie to quote, and the plot was something different. I guess I was hoping to see a movie that was set just before he was captured and put in jail, and the crimes he commited to get their. This movie starts our in his past way before that.  Check it out, decent movie.</p></body></html>

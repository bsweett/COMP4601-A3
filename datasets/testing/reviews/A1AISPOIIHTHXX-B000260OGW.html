He was in 2 hit baseball movies with Bull Durham and Field of Dreams, one of my favorite films ever with JFK, the Academy Award-winning Dances With Wolves and a hit with Whitney Houston in the Bodyguard. But then came Waterworld and the Postman: some of the 90's most reviled movies. Now I haven't seen the Postman and what little I remember of Waterworld wasn't all that bad but the disdain people have over his career seems kind of unfair. Open Range seems like a good attempt at showing people he still has it and while it's not the greatest film he's done, it's certainly one of the better ones he's done recently.<br /><br />4 free range cattle grazers, Charley, Boss, Mose and Button find themselves the target of a greedy rancher named Baxter who is more interested in having property he can see to cattle raisers rather than letting them go as they please. Charley and Boss find one of their own dead and the other barely alive and so they find help in a doctor and his sister and a mind for vengeance. In the end, it's 2 guys against Baxter, his corrupt sheriff lackey Poole and a host of hired gunmen.<br /><br />I remember watching an older movie which was a little over 3 hours and that was just the theatrical cut. Well-known western director Sergio Leone also loved to have long films to build pacing, suspense and character development. Lately though, film goers are either ADD-influenced or they're just more used to shorter films (like me). It's not that Open Range is a dull and boring movie, it's just one where shaving off a good 15 minutes would've made it excellent. After what's probably one of the more intense and awesome showdown gunfights, the film still keeps going so while it is a nice pace from just ending the movie right there, it does drag it a bit.<br /><br />Acting-wise it's pretty straight across the board. Robert Duvall is excellent, Costner is not as bad as you think he is and what little screen time he's given, Diego Luna of Y Tu Mama Tambien fame manages to be memorable without being one of those annoying brats. Shortchanged a little bit is Annette Bening who's either given too little to do or just not enough scenes to be in. The one thing about the film is there's a weird detachment with the characters where I almost didn't quite sympathize with everything. The story was fine but it just didn't have an emotional anchor but maybe it's just me.<br /><br />Is it a good western? Sure, the cinematography's great, the final gunfight's kickass and the acting is great but will this beat new favorites like Unforgiven or oldies like Once Upon a Time in the West? Doubt it. But this is no Postman blunder but then again it's no Dances With Wolves. It's kind of in-between...a sort of Dances With the Postman if you will. Just kidding.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Performance By Don Cheadle"></head><body><p>This is a very fast paced action, suspense thriller with twists and turns that make you wonder which side of the fence you want to be on. When does right become wrong and who gets to decide the good from the bad? How far is one willing to go? These are issues being faced by an undercover agent as he trys to do his job as well as do the right thing.....or does he have that luxury? Don Cheadle does a wonderful job in bringing this character to life. Guy Pearce also did well as the persistent agent also trying to do his job. I think the moral of this story is...."You can't always tell your friends from your enemies". "As well as the lack of morals and principles will always lead to the breakdown of any society."</p></body></html>

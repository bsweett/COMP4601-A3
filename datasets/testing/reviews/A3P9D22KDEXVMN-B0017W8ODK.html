The romance and attraction between the two feels very real as the movie progresses, which is a testament to their ability.  The true star of the film, and an easy character to hate, is Briony, who is played to perfection by three separate actresses.  This is a complicated story that is not exactly a "feel good" film.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are very valuable; especially the commentary from director Joe Wright, who does a masterful job with the movie.  From England to France, the film features excellent scenery.  This film is set just prior to World War II and serves as the backdrop for the release of McAvoy from prison to serve his country.  Choices and a crime play huge in the movie; betrayal, love, and loyalty are the other key themes.  This is a four star film that from a technical standpoint is excellent.</p></body></html>

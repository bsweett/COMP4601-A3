She has to look after her crazy-sick mother and two younger siblings; her father Jessup has vanished. We learn quickly that Jessup cooked crystal meth - the major means of support for many of the families in this area - and that he had been caught a couple of weeks previously, and put up his house and property for bond. Now he's disappeared, and the house and land will be taken away from the family if he can't be found, so it's up to Ree to find him. Unfortunately, even though nearly all of the exhausted, depressed and sullen people she comes across in her odyssey through the gloomy, blighted yet beautiful landscape of rocky hills and scrubby forests are related to her, very few of them are willing to give her so much as the time of day. Suspicious of the law, they're unwilling to even help one of their own stave off homelessness - and some of them are more than willing to show her what comes of asking too many questions.<br /><br />This is a really powerful and stark, unsentimental look at the underbelly of American rural life. Most of the characters here are really unpleasant, even downright hateful, prone to quick violence and selfish and paranoid in the extreme - at least, on the surface. One of the most brilliant facets of this excellent film, cowritten and directed by Debra Granik, is that it slowly reveals a modicum of humanity in most of these gruff exteriors - and also shows that for all of Ree's bearing as someone who stays away from drugs herself and is trying to keep her family going, she's just as much a part of this tragic and beat-down culture as the rest of them. It's sad but not surprising for example that she never even THINKS to go to any authorities to help find her father - even once she starts to suspect that he's been killed, and knows who the killers are likely to be. Even when she's been beaten half to death, she relies only on herself and, eventually, her uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes), a frightening and clearly very violent man who nevertheless has a streak of decency as regards his own family, and a pride in helping out those who need it.<br /><br />Hawkes is getting a lot of justifiable praise for his performance, which should end up winning plenty of Supporting Actor awards as the year goes on, but the 19-year-old Lawrence does just as good a job in a much less show-offy role, always convincing as a determined and still vaguely hopeful young woman just on the cusp of learning that life isn't going to be good for her if she stays here. All of the women and men we see who are significantly older than her seem prematurely aged - Teardrop looks close to 60 but is probably supposed to be in his early 40s, and the women look even more haggard and abused. And yet there's never any question that Ree is going to leave her family behind; even when she goes to an Army recruiter, we know that she's only going because she doesn't really know how it works, a naivete that she'll soon lose, along with, most likely, her hope and dreams.<br /><br />Shot digitally but hauntingly beautiful and never feeling "cheap" despite it's obvious low budget, this is a film that respects the people and the landscape even if it's frustrated with them, and saddened. I expect this will be in my year-end top 10.</p></body></html>

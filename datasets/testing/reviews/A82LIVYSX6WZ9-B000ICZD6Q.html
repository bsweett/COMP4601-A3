<meta name="summary" content="Quaid and Grace give excellent performances...a winner"></head><body><p>Dennis Quaid (Flight Of The Pheonix, The Alamo) stars as Dan, a loving father and husband who has a wonderful job as head of a sports magazine until one day when he is bumped out of the position by young hotshot Carter, played by Topher Grace (Tv's That 70's Show, Oceans 12). Grace then gets to know Quaid and his family a little better by leeching onto him and in the process he becomes involved with Quaid's oldest daughter, played by Scarlett Johanssson (Lost In Translation, Ghost World). Things heat up with Quaid finds out about the relationship and the company he is with starts to crumble. Good natured performances by everyone especially Quaid and Grace. It can be funny sometimes, dramatic sometimes and all the mushy guhsy stuff but it's another winner by writer and director Paul Weitz who also did the movie About A Boy which was a good movie as well. Also starring Margaret Helgenberger (Species, Tv's CSI), Ty Burrell (Dawn Of The Dead '04), Clark Gregg (We Were Soldiers), Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions, Hellboy), David Paymer (Chill Factor, Mr. Saturday Night), John Cho (Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Better Luck Tomorrow) and a surprising cameo by Malcolm McDowell (Pact With The Devil, A Clockwork Orange). A good movie to bring on the new year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rocky in a Time Machine"></head><body><p>Rocky finds a time machine and emerges as Depression-era boxer Jim Braddock.  Russell Crowe plays the historical character who restarts his boxing career to feed his family and ends up heavyweight champion of the world after beating the feared Max Baer.  Paul Giamatti has a great role as Braddock's manager.  A solid effort by all involved, but somehow just a little too pat and too consciously inspirational.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Like life itself, there is no "rapture" (though the Coen brothers have not abandoned all hope)"></head><body><p>Poetry fans tend to make much of the original source of the the title--W. B. Yeats' "Sailing to Byzantium," in which the aging narrator wishes to exchange his hard life in Ireland ("that country") for an imaginary aesthetic existence in ancient Byzantium, with its mosaic temples and golden sculptures.  But neither the novelist (Cormac McCarthy) nor the Coen brothers are promising any sort of deliverance through poetry, art or any other imagined alternative to mortal existence.  This isn't a story for elitist intellectuals and interpreters of Yeats' frequently arcane visions (some of my students even find the poem downright "wacky").  On the other hand, the movie is not merely a story for those in need of a couple of hours of escape (though I frankly found the basic plot and characters so entertaining I was hanging on to my seat with white knuckles to the very end).<br /><br />But the story is the Coen brothers' "bait" to get the viewer to think about non-trivial matters.  After all, it's only we humans who are blessed with "self-consciousness"-- with the capacity to think about our individual "identities," and even about our own life and death (though the beauty of good movies is that further inquiry into "deep meanings" is an option, not a requirement).  Personally, I choose to take the bait and the next step: what's the point of the story?  what's the "meaning" of what we've just seen?  After some (not much) deliberation, I'd offer the following "translation" of the title (sorry about the wordiness): the older we get in this finite, temporary world, the more conscious we become of our mortality and death.  Some of us pretend we can beat it; most of us see it as irrational and unfair; practically all of us avoid or at least postpone thoughts about the subject, instead preferring to wait around and see what happens.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones says toward the end of the story that he's quitting as sheriff.  He had expected "God to somehow come into his life" but is now too fully aware that God (much less he himself) is over-matched.  The film's nemesis is a merciless "executioner" with less conscience than The Terminator and sufficient inscrutability to make even Woody Harrelson's perceptive diagnosis of him (as a psychopathic killer with principles, albeit devoid of "morality") inadequate.  In short, the film is a version of an Ingmar Bergman film like "Through a Glass Darkly" or an earlier, better-known film like Bergman's "The Seventh Seal"--the primary difference being that the Coen Brothers' filmic and narrating style is more apt to catch the attention of a larger, "non-academic" audience.  It's doubtful many of those who see the film will be satisfied with the conclusion.  In fact, there is no closure, thus breaking an unwritten rule of all cinema.  Recall how Hitchock has a shrink appear at the end of "Psycho" to explain in logical terms the character of Norman Bates (and practically everything we've just seen).  When the 1919 German expressionistic film, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," played before American audiences, an actor was hired to appear on stage at the end of the movie to assure us that the monstrous killer-psychopath was now completely cured (no need to worry about guys like Hitler).  And so we would all like to believe--about extended life-spans, the "cures" of medicine, the progress of science.  But the older you get--and the more inquisitive--the more you realize that the advertisers-promoters-money-hungry pharmaceutical companies, cosmetic surgeons, "powerful" positive thinkers--have sold us all a bill of goods.  Like the characters in the film, they're as likely as us not to know what's going to happen next, pretending that life is an open and free proposition and that we could be one of the "lucky ones," awaiting the equivalent of personal fame and fortune if not immortality.<br /><br />Josh Brolin appears to be the sympathetic "hero"--flawed by greed and, like the characters of "Treasure of the Sierra Madre," making what could be a fatal mistake.  Yet he has a John Wayne-like rugged individualism, a knack for survival, and commands instant respect from those around him once they learn of his service in "Nam"--but that won't get you diddly in the relentless, fatalistic, flip-of-a-coin determinism that, in the Coen Brothers' view of modern existence, controls our lives.  Brolin's conscience requires him to return to the scene of a crime with water for the survivor of a drug deal gone terribly bad, yet he can dismiss his wife's concerns for her mother. And in this instance we as the audience can afford to dismiss them as well.  By this time we're conditioned to expect such  a remark to be followed by the Executioner's (Javier Bardem--looking like a smaller but more chilling version of Schwarznegger or Andre the Giant) quick extermination of the person so named via his powerful weapon with its menacing silencer.  But that would follow a certain pattern of logic--instead she dies of cancer.  And when our leading contender for hero is momentarily distracted by a sunbathing babe in long shot, there's no need any longer to even play out the execution. We see a dead body floating in the motel's pool (motels outnumber "homes" by a considerable margin in this movie--as mortal beings, we're all "transients," whether we know it or not, whether we've paid a mortage or not.<br /><br />Brolin's wife suddenly becomes a central figure, but only briefly.  She at least has no illusions about getting a lucky roll of the dice.  Her fate, like that of all mortals, is preordained, and she refuses to play the Executioner's coin-flip game, calling it more accurately: "It's not me or the coin that decides what happens to me.  It's you."  But in this circular question about free will and the meaning of life, Bardem answers her back: "You're wrong.  That's how I got here."  In other words, each of us could not have been born had the slightest circumstance been changed on the night (or whenever) we were conceived.  And who knows why we were born as human beings and not cats?  It's all a game of chance, and there isn't even an authentic card dealer. (The viewer can only speculate why the Executioner sees his own dicy birth as license to reverse the process--serving as the agent of hastening death for all.  Is he sparing his victims Kierkegaard's characterization of mortality as a "sickness onto death"--a charitable interpretation, yet his actions practically resist characterization as "evil" due to their irreversible and mechanical necessity).  But its through this mysterious (and deadly) character that the movie destroys all of our illusions and ultimately goes after the worst of the deadly sins--about which, even after the Bible and all the world's important literature and religions, we lack awareness: pride, hubris, taking upon ourselves what belongs only to God.  When will we learn?  Why can't we?  Why must we be so prideful in the face of more violence, terrorism, and destruction?<br /><br />But therein lies the film's admission of Aristotle's "fatal flaw" and along with it the small ray of light in the film (along with some moments of humor, which even the critics seem to have missed).  Brolin, after all, did make a mistake and had the arrogance to think he could get away with his theft of the drug money intended for someone else.  And for a moment, he let carnal desire distract him from the real threat.  Moreover, he took his own life more seriously than that of his wife or mother-in-law, by assuming that the Nemesis-Executioner was interested "only" in him!  But you simply can't take for granted the next move of this Executioner, who passes up an opportunity to snuff out the sheriff, Tommy Lee Jones (the closest thing to an authentic hero). Not being detected could be a motive, but is it possible he senses in the sheriff greater realism and honesty than in any of the other characters?<br /><br />The last two scenes do nothing to prepare the spectator for an end, but they do practically "require" interpretation (witness the complaints from the numerous reviewers who trash the entire film because it doesn't end as they might like).  I like happy endings, and I'm frequently impatient when things don't go my way, but I'm afraid that in this story, especially, those viewers who simply refuse to discuss, think about, or interpret a disturbing moment (or even a fictional movie!) are told  to shape up or ship out. The Executioner (quite vulnerable himself, by the way, but a better survivor than Harrelson or Brolin) walks away.  Behind him he leaves the seeds of greed (and of fatal pride) in a young boy who took money (from the Nemesis, naturally) in exchange for what began as a Good Samaritan act.  Next on the agenda of the recovered Executioner, who ambles off into a typical American neighborhood (like that in David Lynch's "Blue Velvet") who knows what or whom?--the sheriff?  His are the last words as he reports a dream about meeting his father (who did not die an old man), and then says: "I woke up."  That awakening is what this movie is all about. The screen goes black waiting for the spectator's inner light to come on.  It's time to wake up--perhaps now more than ever.  There may be a future, but there will be no lottery tickets--even to those who win them.  It's we who must act to make the best of that mortally-defined fateful span of existence that lies before us.  We can't know if our efforts will bear positive fruit, but we can know that "good" isn't simply going to happen by wishing and waiting for it.  And we can also know that our prideful moments can only bring more misery.  And if we don't know this now, the storyteller seems to be saying, we most certainly will either know it, or feel the effect, when we're older.<br /><br />But this may too rigid, or unforgiving, an interpretation. Thinkers like Kierkegaard, Tillich, O'Connor, Ingmar Bergman had no illusions about the lack of theological curiosity residing in human beings.  Yet they also accepted Socrates' insistence that "the unexamined life is unfit to be lived," knowing that fatal pride is born of presumptuous ignorance, not of open inquiry).  Created with the unique ability to question, to examine, and to know, humans often appear practically eager to forfeit this "gift" (we can be thankful most of the world's great religions make room for a God of grace--a Deity extending love to those who may not have the opportunity for rigorous examining of one's self and surroundings).<br /><br />For those who prefer a less theological interpretation, the emphasis on "land" in the title provides it.  Why would the storyteller select as a setting for this parable about modern-day America a vast, open, dry and sterile wasteland?  Reminiscent of T. S. Eliot's modernist poem "The Wasteland" or Italian film director Michelangelo Antonioni's critique of present-day America ("Zabriskie Point"), the setting repeatedly points to a vacuum, a void, a land laid waste by the same human beings it once nurtured and empowered.  Everyone wants answers.  We have the power to find them, but only if we're not too complacent or proud to search for them.</p></body></html>

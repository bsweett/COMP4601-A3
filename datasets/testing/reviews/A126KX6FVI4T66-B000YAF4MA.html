<meta name="summary" content="another sentimental movie about death"></head><body><p>What would you do if you had<br />news of your impending death?<br />Write a list of things to do?<br />Last wishes for dying men are fine for the rich.<br />My personal preference is to make every minute<br />that I can count for the rest of the world<br />of men. Selfish wishes are what most people do<br />with their lives;<br />I don't think it should be celebrated.<br />Very well acted and directed, just petty<br />and small as a movie....sentimental.</p></body></html>

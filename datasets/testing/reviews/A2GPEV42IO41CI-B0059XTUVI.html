<meta name="summary" content="Streep is great"></head><body><p>Meryl Streep stars in this biopic of Margaret Thatcher as the elderly lady, suffering from dementia, remembers key moments of her past.  We see young Margaret in her first political campaign, as she meets her beloved husband (later played by Jim Broadbent), and her eleven years as Prime Minister with its struggles and triumphs; but mostly, we see her deteriorating health and increasing frailty.<br /><br />I was absolutely stunned by Streep's impersonation of Thatcher; aided by incredibly believable make-up, she looks and sounds just like her and gives a thrilling performance.  It is an example of the finest acting and I'm glad she was rewarded with an Oscar, but I wish the role had been played by a British actress instead.  Jim Broadbent, as Denis Thatcher, plays his usual, jovial character and, while very likable, reminded me of silly Horace Slughorn from `Harry Potter.'<br /><br />The script was underwhelming in scenes depicting Thatcher's public life, but it was excellent in the very moving scenes of her current life as a delicate, rather pathetic, old lady.  All in all, I enjoyed it but think it could have been better.</p></body></html>

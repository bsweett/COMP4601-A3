<meta name="summary" content="The downside of this movie"></head><body><p>There's plenty of anger, and angst, in this movie, but not nearly enough and not the right kind. Based on the flimsiest circumstantial evidence, the wife, Terry (Joan Allen), assumes that her heretofore responsible and loving husband has flown the coop with his Swedish secretary. Moreover, over a period of years she makes no serious effort to track him down. Instead, Terry, an intelligent, educated, stay-at-home mom living an upper class privileged lifestyle with four intelligent daughters ranging from fifteen to early twenties decides to immediately turn herself into an alcoholic. The anger she shows is mostly directed at the people closest to her.<br /><br />As soon as Terry starts drinking herself into a daily stupor, her neighbor Denny (Kevin Costner) ingratiates himself as her drinking buddy. Denny is an ex-baseball star who, for reasons unknown (anger, maybe?), became an alcoholic long ago. So these two alcoholics get along drinking and watching stupid TV shows all day. Well, they cut back on some of the TV once they become lovers. But they don't cut back on the booze.<br /><br />After years of putting up with Terry's "bad moods," which the sex doesn't seem to ameliorate, Denny gets fed up and starts showing some anger of his own. He kicks down a heavy door with Terry on the other side. If Terry had been standing closer to the door, she could easily have been killed. But hey, Denny was just expressing anger and a terrified Terry couldn't apologize enough for her bad moods, begging Denny to come back. And from that point on, Denny is no longer passive, no longer anyone's "bitch" (as he tells Terry). He's back to being a macho man, or his version of it: a sweet, loving man who's not afraid to kick butts or doors when anger calls for it.<br /><br />I could say more but it's all so disgustingly bad. The 15-year-old daughter concludes the movie with a "wise" epitaph about the upside of anger, which amounts to saying it's better on the other side of it. The only upside to this movie are all the cute girls.</p></body></html>

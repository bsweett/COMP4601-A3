<meta name="summary" content="Pitch Black (2000)"></head><body><p>David Twohy's follow-up to '96's The Arrival is one of grave circumstances and underappreciated symbolism. After sustaining heavy damage from a meteor storm, a spacecraft transporting numerous people crashes on a hot, desolate planet. Once the sunlight fades into darkness, however, the survivors of the crash become prey to a species of flying, nocturnal alien, against which there is only one chance for their survival: Riddick (Vin Diesel), a convicted murderer who was being moved by their craft to a far-off prison.<br /><br />Though it underwent critical scrutiny, Pitch Black is one of very few mainstream Hollywood films to address the Muslim faith with high regards, rather than denigration. One of the more prominent roles depicted in the film is Abu "Imam" al-Walid (played by Keith David), a Muslim who sees the good in Riddick, despite the prisoner's forte for killing. The character, in fact, is paid the ultimate honor a slaughter-fest flick can deliver--survival--and is included in the film's below-par sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick.</p></body></html>

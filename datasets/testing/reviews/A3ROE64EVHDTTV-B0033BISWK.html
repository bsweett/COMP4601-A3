But in the case of "District 9," we have something else entirely.  It's a rough and brutal film, portraying aliens not as the sleek, powerful, awe-inspiring beings from heaven.  Instead, these aliens are wretched, and humans are treating them like dirt.  Therein lies the strength and power of the film; it serves to showcase modern issues concerning refugee camps, shanty-towns, and social corruption, while simultaneously demonizing humanity.  With themes like these, "District 9" proves to be a truly unique and thought-provoking experience.<br /><br />As far as the entertainment value goes, the movie is not bad.  The first half is purely rough documentary-style, with interviews and news footage cut in throughout.  Then the second half resembles an actual film with lots of action (and some very gnarly violence).  As such, the plot is interesting and moves at a decent pace.  The story is generally not bad.  Characters are alright; there are some moments where the people do appalling things or act stupid, but I believe it goes hand-in-hand with the flawed portrayal of humanity in general.  Acting and writing are adequate.  Photography is solid half of the time and a bit shaky at other times; it's pretty good all around.  Production design features some great sets, props, costumes, creature effects, vehicles, and weapons.  Music is decent too.<br /><br />This disc has good quality.  Video quality is excellent for the most part; most of the movie shows strong sharpness and detail, with excellent color, contrast, and clarity.  A few parts may appear fuzzier or softer due to different cameras or film stocks used for the "archival footage," but overall, the disc offers the highest possible PQ overall.  Sound quality is good (DTS-HD MA 5.1).  This disc includes a number of extras (a commentary, 23 minutes of deleted scenes, documentaries, some interactive features, trailers, and more).</p></body></html>

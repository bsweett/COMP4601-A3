Yes, it's got stock footage of the Iraq war, and an all-star casting playing members of the Cabinet, and it's got a greatest-hits collection of everyone's favorite George W. Bush misquotes.  But it's also a sad, downbeat little drama about a man-child who failed at everything he ever did, and then became President just to prove a point to his father -- and failed at that, too.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's movie has been praised so far for not being overtly political, and for being somewhat sympathetic to its subject.  Still, the director doesn't pull punches on showing "W"'s hard-drinking past, and he lists all of the man's life failures prior to becoming owner of the Texas Rangers.  There are a few trademark manipulative Stone moments -- for example, a pan over the infamous "Mission Accomplished" poster quickly jump-cuts to a montage of Iraq insurgent bombshells and wounded veterans.  We also get the moment where the Prseident nearly chokes on a pretzel while watching college football on TV.  And, even though Bush did win the 2004 election, the movie stops short of that in order to end on a surprisingly downbeat note.  This movie is sympathetic to Bush, but it's also quite critical.  There's a fleeting image of John McCain, too, lest we forget the choice we have to make in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />The cast is almost uniformly superb.  Josh Brolin, playing Bush both in his hard-living 20s and his Presidential late 50s, carries off the role so effortlessly that it's easy to overlook how hard he had to work to make this movie work.  And it does work, thanks to Brolin.<br /><br />The aces of the supporting cast include James Cromwell as George H.W. Bush -- giving the man a true gravitas that pop culture denied him 15 years ago, when he was being parodied by Dana Carvey and "The Simpsons".  Jeffrey Wright is heroic as Colin Powell.  Finally, Richard Dreyfuss's interpretation of Dick Cheney merits serious Oscar consideration.  No over-the-top trademark Dreyfuss moments here.  He is superb lurking in the shadows and lording over a map of oil wells in the Middle East.<br /><br />I only had two disappoinments walking out of the theater.  One was the limited scope of the movie.  There's no mention of what history will really recall about the Bush presidency: the questions surrounding the 2000 and 2004 elections; the moment of triumph at Yankee Stadium shortly following 9/11; the Hurricane Katrina debacle.  Of course, by including all that Stone would have been wide open to charges of political bias, and then this wouldn't have been a family film about a son vainly struggling to impress his father.<br /><br />The other disappointment was Thandie Newton.  With a vicious sneer on her face and a strange choice of enunciation, her Condi Rice is more a caricature than a portrayal.  Had the movie been more overtly political or had the other supporting actors also mocked their characters, I might not have noticed.  But here, Thandie was as overshadowed by the rest of the cast as has George W. Bush been overhshadowed by his father.</p></body></html>

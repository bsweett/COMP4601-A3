The defenders are the Japanese. Recently, letters from those defenders of Iwo Jima in World War II were unearthed in a cave, unmailed. Then the movie flashes back to the war. The letters home furnish much of the story. Ordinary Japanese conscripts are  stationed on this god-forsaken island. This is a sympathetic movie about them. They know the Americans are coming. They have to. They don't know when. They hope reenforcements are coming. But they also know they are going go die. Hopefully they will do so with honor. In so many ways they are just guys like our men with their petty gripes about the food, the waiting around, their fool superior officers etc. American soldiers want to live but many will die. Japanese choose death over defeat & that is the big difference. I felt for their plight as many did kill themselves during the battle. However, there was a glimmer of hope. Several of their officers had been to America before the war. Their exposure to our culture convinced them there might be another way. An extraordinarily good World War II movie & kudos to the fine performances & direction of Clint Eastwood & his associates.</p></body></html>

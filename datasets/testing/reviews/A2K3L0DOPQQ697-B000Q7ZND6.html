<meta name="summary" content="keanu reeves at his best"></head><body><p>I can't get why people review this particular item with 2- and 3-star reviews.  I mean, Keanu Reeves had already established himself as a great actor in The Matrix trilogy, while of course Rachel Weisz was the main reason that many people went to see the movie in the first place.  It was a great movie; I loved it.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, an ex-cop who believes that he is the only one who can stop an invasion of demons from taking over the world- and it helps that he can actually see the demons.  This movie contains a lot of supernatural material, the main reason why I saw this movie in the first place (besides Rachel Weisz, of course), seeing as I love supernatural thrillers.<br /><br />Constantine's main focus is on helping skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister (also played by Weisz), and their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldy events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost. Constantine takes many trips to hell and back by going through a body of standing water (i.e. his bathtub, a pan of water).  There are also many sequences of demonic activity and language that almost makes a sailor blush, but I still loved this movie.<br /><br />Once again, I complain that Amazon's review system only goes up to 5 stars; otherwise, this would be much higher-rated.  Definitely recommended for fans of sci-fi or horror movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bucket List"></head><body><p>Although older people or those that have known someone with a terminal illness may have more appreciation for this movie, most people should enjoy it. Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole, and Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers give great performances as men who are already past midlife and appreciating their waning years. Edward as a captain of industry, and Carter as a father and trivia buff. When they both find themselves next to each other in the hospital with cancer and a few months to live, both their lives change. The greatest change is for Edward. The movie is not to preachy but it shows us some of realism of being terminally ill with cancer. We see the impact it has on each man in his own way.<br /><br />For the fun of it Carter had started to create a "Bucket List" based on a class he had taken discussing what they wanted to do before they die. Carter throws it away when he learns of his final fast approaching fate. Edward finds it and decides it's the best course of action for them to have one last fling of life before they die. The rest the movie we see them travelling around the world, racing cars, and skydiving. The conclusion of the movie we see they go their separate ways with different priorities but then meeting again in a dramatic way when one is near death. The message given is a good one for anyone that has a family or friends they have alienated. Good quality DVD with fair replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch "Secondhand Lions", "The World's Fastest Indian", and "Finding Forester". - C. Luster</p></body></html>

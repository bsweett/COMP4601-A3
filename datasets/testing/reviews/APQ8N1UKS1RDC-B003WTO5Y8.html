<meta name="summary" content="YES!!!!! FINALLY MY FAVORITE GENRE OF FILM GET'S RECOGNIZED BY THE OSCAR"></head><body><p>The Silence of the Lambs brought GOLD to the arms of HORROR films<br />in 1991 and I can still remember it like it was yesterday watching<br />that Sunday night. The movie had already garnered 3 Oscars for<br />actress,actor and director...Now was the time for the big MOMENT!<br />No way was it going to get best picture...NO WAY! For how many<br />times before has our HORROR been snuffed at from the ACADEMY AWARDS<br />With the exception of Frederich March in DR.JEKYLL(he won in 1932<br />for best actor...had to share the honors with another actor..I blame this<br />for the movie he was in..A HORROR)The Academy has gave out a handful<br />of statues since the first ceremony in 1927..Some I can think of are<br />Oscar winners like The Exorcist winner for best sound(oh! "whoopee")<br />The Omen and Jaws for best score and Piper Laurie with Sissy Spacek carrie<br />were nominated...O.K. What about Anthony Perkins for PSYCHO(no nomination?<br />????????????????) Jaws for best picture 75(lost to the STING..The Sting<br />is good..but c'mon!!!!!!) and we can go on and on Kubrick's Shining<br />NOTHING! So I knew in my heart Silence too was to get nothing,but<br />lo and behold..IT WON! I was so happy I jumped up and down and<br />held (I can still remember)holding my Dracula(1931) and JAWS VHS<br />tapes in my hand screaming WE DID IT! WE DID IT! I was so ecstatic<br />I thought the neighbors would call the police. I am not going to go<br />into details about the plot to this film...I am sorry you can read<br />any other review to get that! I just wanted to say to every one<br />involved in this THANK YOU! To Thomas Harris,Johnathan Demme<br />Jodi Foster Anthony Hopkins Scott Glen and of course MY FAVORITE<br />the GREAT Ted Levine(don't even get me started on why he did not<br />get best supporting actor????????????????????) You did give the<br />best picture for 1991 and a HORROR film I proudly display in my<br />vast SPOOKY COLLECTION. LONG LIVE THE SHEEP!<br /><br />DON'T YOU HURT MY DOG!<br /><br />DONT'CHA MAKE ME HURT YOUR DOG,YOU LOWER A TELEPHONE NOW YOUR DOG'S IN ALOT OF PAIN.<br /><br />YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PAIN IS!!!<br /><br />OH!

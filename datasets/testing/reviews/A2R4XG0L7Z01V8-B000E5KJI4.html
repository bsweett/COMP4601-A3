So I'd highly recommend to buy only if you're interested in this kind of movie - rent otherwise, or borrow from a friend.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest fan of Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom - I prefer my guys who are a bit rough around the edges, whereas these two are a bit too pretty for my liking. I know, I must be the only girl in the world who doesn't fantasise about Brad Pitt. With all the publicity though, I'm definitely looking forward to Mr & Mrs Smith!<br /><br />What I found most annoying about this movie, and many other movies similar to it, is how they're all trying to be the next Lord Of The Rings (according to my Dad, as I still haven't seen those movies, and at the moment, have no wish to). Also, was it just me, or were the main stars constantly posing?! It got on my nerves after a while!<br /><br />I think I'd probably heard of Troy, Achilles & the Iliad through school, although I can't remember reading it. The whole Achilles myth/legend was very familiar to me - where he can be killed through his heel, after his mum dipped him in something, but held him by his heel.<br /><br />This is a butt-numbing 156 minutes long, and could have easily been shortened, and made it pass quicker. The battle scenes are very cliched, and we've seen them a zillion times before. You don't know which army you want to win - with Braveheart (for example), you knew you wanted the Scots to win. With this, it's very confusing. Look out for Brian Cox (he's in everything!) and James Cosmo (?), who was in Braveheart also. You felt no sympathy for any of the characters - although I must admit Hector (Eric Bana) made me very sad towards the end. (Without ruining it for anyone!) You know something's wrong with the film, when you're laughing at the death scenes, and making up things that the cast are saying (BOO!) as they're lying on the funeral pyre. However, I did love the funeral scenes, especially with the focus on the coins on the eyes, to pay the ferryman - this was a terrific tradition.<br /><br />This film can be liked or hated. With the severe lack of decent eye candy, instead of posing pretty boys, I'm sitting on the fence with this film. It's too long (although I can sit through Titanic perfectly), and it doesn't hold your attention for long enough. I was always looking for an excuse to pause it. It's definitely not something I'd ever watch again. Once is enough!</p></body></html>

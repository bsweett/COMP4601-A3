I was rooting for them to succeed except at the expense of my beloved Phillies.  Alas the dream was not to be as the Bucs wilted in the heat of the pennant race.  While their success lasted it was good for baseball.  Whether you are a large market team or small you break from spring training with the intention of winning the whole ball of wax.  If you are a Kansas City Royals fan you don't want to be told that your team doesn't have a chance from Jump Street.  As the baseball adage goes a season is a marathon not a sprint.  "Moneyball" starts after the 2001 campaign where the Oakland A's fall short in the American League Championship Series.  The small market A's are losing their star players for greener pastures and paychecks.  General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) asks the owner of the A's for more money to attract suitable replacements.  The money is not forthcoming.  Beane, not willing to throw in the towel, decides to think outside the box.  With the assistance of Yale economist Peter Brandt (Jonah Hill) they reconstruct the team with modestly priced players who compliment each other.  Is this fluorish enough to win the World Series?  Baseball fans already know the answer and novices would be behooved to find out.  The thing I admire most about "Moneyball" is it's affinity for our national pastime.  Sure the film has it's share of aracana and statistics but it gets everything right from the crack of the bat to the calls to sportstalk radio.  Pitt is charismatic as the wheeler-dealer Beane.  You believe he can charm a decent utility player from another team for one of his skirt chasing headaches.  Hill is every geeks dream.  He gets to play fantasy baseball with the Real McCoy!  Philip Seymour Hoffman is effectively taciturn as manager Art Howe who has to sink or swim with the machinations of Beane.  There has been much debate whether this is the greatest baseball film of all time.  That would be unfair to "Moneyball" or "Field of Dreams" or "Pride of the Yankees".  They are all quite different films that have baseball as a subtext.  As a fan of forty years it's impossible for me to say if the movie is accessible to non-fans.  Regardless, "Moneyball" hits a grand slam.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Cool Premise which turns into a not so good movie!"></head><body><p>... I have to say that I was expecting so much more from this film. The idea of death catching up to those who have avoided it makes a really cool premise for a movie, but in the end it just doesn't live up to my expectations. The acting is rather weak and the ending is pretty bad as well. If you don't take the movie too serious you probably will enjoy much more. I will admit the death seens were wickedly cool, but that still doesn't make up for a movie with so much potential that just fails to deliver.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Most mediocre of the series"></head><body><p>"Saw III" should have been the epic, horrifying end to this demented series; unfortunately, it wasn't epic and it probably isn't the end of the series at all.<br /><br />The reason I enjoyed the first film was not the gore, although I have to admit I was impressed by the openly brutal scenario of people having to hack their own legs off in order to survive (one either overcomes the fear of horrendous physical pain or dies), but because it had a soul and a brain behind it: an atmosphere of mystery and horror pervaded it.  No one knew who was the vicious mastermind behind these inventive and repugnant torture/murders or who would go to such lengths to prove something to society about the depreciation of life. Saw II" carried on in a similar vein; more was revealed about Jigsaw and he was face to face with an angry cop who wanted his son back.  Still, we didn't know anything about him and it never became too personal; he remained a ghastly enigma with an intriguingly intelligent and thoroughly evil persona.<br /><br />In this movie, though, they make the character that could have rivalled Hannibal Lecter into a soap opera.  The film begins promisingly (an ex-con gets permanently reformed in a rather unorthodox way) and Jigsaw, ironically, has to face his own mortality through his imminent death by cancer.  From there it degenerates into tedious emotional dynamics involving his protege Amanda, a young doctor with a time operated shotgun shell collar around her neck, and plays an extended and really ridiculous "game" with a blameless victim of a drunk driver.<br /><br />The character Jeff and his "vengeance conflict" (how can you blame the guy for not wanting to save the guy who ran over his child?) is really just an excuse for us to watch Jigsaw's demented assistant indulge in emotional drama about her checkered and boring past.  Things get so monotonous that nothing shocks anymore.  The end is the most ridiculous plot twist I've ever seen and it isn't enduring what precedes it.  If they were going to do this, they should have ended the series with the original.</p></body></html>

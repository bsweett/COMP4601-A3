<meta name="summary" content="A tremendous movie...."></head><body><p>When Sylvester Stallone is involved....you know youre going to get terrific action.  But the movies story and Stallones character of John Rambo are very interesting as well.  The thing that appealed to me most of all in this movie is Rambo barely says 2 words througout the whole movie and at the end he just blows up.  He explodes about the war,  his buddies getting killed,  etc.  Its an explosive and dramatic moment....the topper of the whole movie.<p>  Again,  terrific movie,  if youre into action/drama,  take a look at this one, its great!!!</p></body></html>

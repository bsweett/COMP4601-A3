<meta name="summary" content="Will Ferrell in his first movie post Elf"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell stars in this movie playing a newsman in the 70's in San Deigo, and while I wasn't to much of a fan of Elf, but I do have to say that I really see Ferrell playing a newsman, then see him play a giant elf, or a human that doesn't know he is a human, that thinks he is an elf. As the movie opens, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), are the top news team in all of San Deigo. Wes Mantooth (Vince Vaughn), is the top anchor at the station that is second to Channel 4, and he hates Ron Burgundy, and would do anything to be the number 1 anchor. Ron lvies by himself with his dog, but then one day Ed Harken (Fred Willard) hires Veronica Corningstone (Married with Children's Christina Applegate) as a reporter. And without welcoming her, they make comments on her assets, and even maybe try to score with her. But then Ron manges to get him to agree to a date, as co-workers as he intoruces her the city that she will be broadcasting news to. And then soon she is prompted to the anchor desk, to co-host the news with Ron, but watch what you put on the teleprompter, because Ron will read whatever yout put up there.</p></body></html>

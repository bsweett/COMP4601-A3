<meta name="summary" content="Se7en (1995)"></head><body><p>I didn't watch Se7en until sometime last year. After watching it, I was amazed by it. I've never seen anything like it. A very disturbing thriller. I didn't have any clue as to how the movie would end. The whole time I was watching it, I didn't even leave my chair. My heart was just pounding. It just freaked me out. Not a lotta movie would do that. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow give great performances. And the 'John Doe' killer... I won't say who plays him for some of those who haven't seen this movie, but, like his other movies, he gives one helluva great performance. Overall, this is definately a classic. And it's not for the squeamish.</p></body></html>

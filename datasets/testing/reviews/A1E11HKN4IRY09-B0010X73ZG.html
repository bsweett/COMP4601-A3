<meta name="summary" content="Mist it by that _ much."></head><body><p>Two things right off the bat can be said about this film.<br />#1. This is a real nail biting, genuinely scary apocalyptic monster movie.<br />#2. The last five minutes bring the statement in #1 in question.<br />I really loved this movie.  It had an intensity that has not been matched in a long while as far as thrillers go.  The characters were all excellent and those you are suppose to care about you actually do.  Which makes the filmmakers decision to conclude it the way they did really disapoint.  I am a huge fan of non-Hollywood endings, but the final moments in THE MIST are so completely bleak they tarnish the film and leave the viewer with a cold rock in the gut that makes the film unwatchable for the second time (it's hard to find truly good movies these days, but when one pops up it's usually the best the 2nd time around-IMO).  The ending is a fine example of either hate it or love it, and would have received 5 stars from this reviewer had the finale been tweaked a touch, and I do mean a touch.  It's a true shame to enjoy something so thoroughly (there are some real nail biting moments, the pharmacy scene was just flipping crazy) to have it culminate into something akin to a delicious piece of fruit with a rotten center.  Almost a fantastic piece of horrific escapism, THE MIST missed.</p></body></html>

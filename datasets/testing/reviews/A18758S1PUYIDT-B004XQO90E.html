<meta name="summary" content="Thoughtful, suspenseful and even touching"></head><body><p>This is unpredictable and a thoughtful story of a soldier who does not know his actual fate until later.....<br />spoilers....<br /><br />He is not much more than  a torso with a brain that is hooked up to a communications and virtual reality device that lets him talk to his coordinators and also go back in time to try to stop a domestic terrorist from blowing up a commuter train, among other things, in Chicago.  Quite the mindbender.  Jake G. is great as the main character.  Good direction also from Duncan Jones.</p></body></html>

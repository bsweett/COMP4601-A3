<meta name="summary" content="ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, OPUS 11"></head><body><p>***1/2 2007. Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. When a toxic product is released in the air, infected people who died become zombies and terrorize the rest of the population. PLANET TERROR is a popcorn movie, that's about all I can say about this motion picture. And I can say the same thing about every Robert Rodriguez movies I've seen, with the exception of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BCKFWK">Sin City - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> maybe because the material Rodriguez worked on wasn't his. When Quentin Tarantino is able to create a film with the same material, Robert Rodriguez will only make a motion picture. That's the difference between an author and a very talented director who hasn't nothing peculiar to say. I enjoyed PLANET TERROR for what it's worth though and I also really liked the preview of MACHETE with Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin. But 12 hours after having seen this movie, I'm already starting to forget it. Recommended.</p></body></html>

Inspector Abeline (Depp) of the London police has stumbled onto a killer like no other he has ever encountered. A man that ritualistically and methodically hunts his victims and mutilates them in the most vicious manner. While most of London is shcoked by the killings, Abeline pursues him not only through the foggy streets of the city, but also through the intense bureaucracy of the London police force. While the plot is rather light the imagery is simply stunning. Intense (And gory) scenes of murder and Abeline's opium hallucinations shock the screen in a hazy red/green wash. While not altogether thrilling, it does offer a good sense of cinematographic inginuity.</p></body></html>

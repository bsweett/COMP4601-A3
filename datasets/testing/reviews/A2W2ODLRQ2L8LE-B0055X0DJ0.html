<meta name="summary" content="The Action Transforms to a New Level"></head><body><p>This movie transforms eye candy to a new level. This movie is not only funny at points, it is loaded with tons of special effects and action. While there have been some extensive negative reviews, I recommend that you still see it for yourself.<br /><br />What I find to be a big plus in this film is that they did not cover under the darkness of night the climax of the action sequences (like in Iron Man 2 that hid  its climax at night). The animators are simply brilliant and are capable of creating their wares in the full view of the sun. This is a bold step that must be appreciated.<br /><br />The visuals are crisp and the 'transformations' are electrifying. This is an action film, so there is no mind bending plot here. It is just a lot of bigger than life action sequences, one after the other. There are no dull moments in this film, you if you have to get something, put this film on pause!</p></body></html>

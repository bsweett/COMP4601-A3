<meta name="summary" content="This is an award winning riveting film"></head><body><p>This film won the best picture and the best screenplay awards at the Sundance Film Festival and the best actor award at Cannes. All three were well deserved. The film is very moving, well acted, and has an interesting and suspenseful story. It focuses on a likeable 17 year old girl whose mother has lost her mind, and she must care for her and her loving 12 year old brother and 6 year old sister in the hill country where semi-literate people live and where they produce illegal drinks and drugs. Her father had been convicted previously for these activities and was caught again. He put up his house, where the 17 year old and her family live, as bail. Then he disappeared. She is told that unless she can find him and bring him to the trial, she will lose her home. This all she has. In fact she needs help from neighbors for food.<br /><br /> She searches for her dad and meets strong resistance. People threaten her. At one point, she is beat up badly. An old girl friend of her father tells her that she saw him recently in the company of fierce men that she didn't recognize. He made believe he didn't recognize her. She said she was sure that "something was going on."<br /><br /> This riveting thriller raises intriguing questions. Is he alive and, if so, where is he? Is he hiding and, if so, why? Is he dead? Who killed him? Why was he killed? Was the sheriff involved? How can she save her home? If he is dead, how can she prove it? Why are people trying to keep her from finding her dad?</p></body></html>

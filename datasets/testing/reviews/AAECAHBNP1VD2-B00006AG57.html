By all logic, after the first. there was no way the Mummy should've been able to return, but hey; it's Hollywood.<br />Again, this is one long rollercoaster ride, with a tip of the tanna leaf to Indiana Jones. Special effects are, again, engaging as hell, Evie somehow managed to get much sexier, Alex lends a nice touch, O'Connel and Im-ho-tep retain the same touches from 1, and there's never a problem with more of Patricia, even if she really can't act. The new crop of villians worked, too, for what they were. Definitely woprth seeing, and some great extras. The way-too-short outtake reel and the constant harping on Scorpion King promos however, are cumbersome.</p></body></html>

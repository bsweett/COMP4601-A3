It has a highly talented cast yet there is a tendency to overacting that makes the film to have more in common with 1950s Hollywood epics like "The Ten Commandments" rather than with more naturalistic, realistic contemporary films. Since all the actors overact, with the exceptions of Christopher Plummer as Aristotle, Anthony Hopkins as the aged Ptolemy, and Jared Leto as Hephaestus, the blame must reside with the director. The historic record would point to Alexander the Great as a tremendous egomaniacal and charismatic leader. Yet here the script tries to elevate Alexander's mission beyond conquest and discovery into some vague concept of universal respect for diversity which may be a contemporary value but was probably not a value of the ancient world of conquest. Listen to the dialogue where Alexander argues with his generals about his desire that they take wives and produce children among the nations they overcome rather than focus on returning to their wives and children in Macedonia with vast treasures and slaves. An argument could be made that he wished to find a way to sustain his victories, which may occur if the victor impregnates the vanquished and establishes kingdoms overseen by the children of these marriages and unions. Great leaders wish to sustain their victories and intermarriage with the defeated nations and tribes may have indeed been Alexander's strategy. Certainly he followed this strategy with this marriage to Roxannas. But if this was truly the case then why was Alexander also compelled to follow a path of discovery to the ends of the known world, particularly in demonstrating that beyond India is the origin of the Nile which, if followed, would bring him and his troops back to the Mediterranean Sea. The speeches delivered by Alexander to his troops wavered in theme from appealing to their desire for conquest and treasure, to that of becoming rules of these new vanquished worlds, to that of discovering the Nile beyond India which will lead them to their homes. Eventually all the arguments fail and he must return or risk total mutiny.<br /><br />The homosexuality of Alexander is presented in an interesting manner in the film. Alexander seems to have a permanent emotional attachment to his childhood friend Hephaestus but is sexually drawn to the Persian slave boy that becomes his lover. In the first half of the film he asks Hephaestus to sleep with him but he gradually transitions to the Persian slave boy without losing his attachment to Hephaestus as his most honest and trusted companion. His attachment to his wife seems to be one whereby he wished to create a dynasty among the people he conquered. Maybe the film reflects the truth that it is rare that any human relationship will meet all needs.<br /><br />The film is visually stunning, as beautiful as any Biblical or Ancient world epic produced in the last 40 years. Yet the narrative sequence is too jolting, bouncing back and forth in time too often. The film would have been further strengthened by a chronological presentation and the inclusion of Alexander's conquest of Greece and Egypt to give a full presentation of the size of this young man's military achievements.</p></body></html>

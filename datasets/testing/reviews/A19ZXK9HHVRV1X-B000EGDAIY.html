I tell you this only so that you will know when you will be able to take a quick refreshment and/or restroom break and not miss anything.  It also pretty much underscores the modus operandi of this film, which is "don't bother with something new when something old will do."  For although "The Grudge" is a remake of a recent Japanese film ("Ju-On," made by the same director, Takashi Shimizu), there really isn't anything here that we haven't seen hundreds of times before in haunted house movies made east of the International Date Line.<br /><br />The bland Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a young foreign exchange student living in Japan who volunteers as a care worker in her spare time.  When she is sent to the home of a strangely "lethargic" woman, Gellar begins to suspect that there is something not quite right about the residence.  From then on, she and several other people, who also share a connection with the house, are haunted by a ghoulish specter who keeps popping up in the strangest places and at the most inopportune moments to exact her revenge for being done away with in an untimely manner (although none of the people she pesters had anything to do with her demise).<br /><br />Although there are a few mildly suspenseful moments scattered throughout the film, "The Grudge" is simply too derivative and too hackneyed to register much of an impact on our psyches, with a great deal of its imagery ripped-off from that seminal horror film "Carnival of Souls."  The story makes very little sense when you start to analyze it seriously and, after all the huffing and puffing to arrive at a stunning climax, the ending deflates like a slowly leaking balloon.  I haven't seen the original version, so I have no idea how it compares to this one.  But I can hardly imagine it was anywhere near as undistinguished and lackluster as this one is (or else why remake it?).  Even with the same director at the controls, perhaps something simply got lost in the translation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Round up the usual suspects""></head><body><p>"The Usual Suspects" is one of director Bryan Singer's early achievements. Forget the bombast of "Superman Returns",or his upcoming "Valkyrie"... this stands as a film noir classic. Kevin Spacey,Benicio Del Toro,Stephen Baldwin,and Gabriel Byrne are an excellent ensemble cast in this thriller.<br /><br />"The Usual Suspects",unlike most thrillers,is more psychological than action packed. Gabriel Byrne stars as a reformed cop while Kevin Spacey is the con man Verbal Kint. There are mind games galore. Who IS Keyser Soze? That's up to the viewer to find out.<br /><br />"The Usual Suspects" keeps you guessing. It's a delicious dish of red herrings. And... who is the arch-criminal,Keyser Soze?</p></body></html>

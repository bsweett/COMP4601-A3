In a word, "amazing." Folks, this Jaws Blu-ray release is what Blu-ray is all about. The *only* way you would know this is a 37 year old movie is by the outfits and hair styles, because the picture quality really is that stunning. This transfer was obviously a labor of love, as it's perfect. If only every older Blu-ray release had that kind of attention to detail for their Blu-ray transfers. The restoration is so amazing, that it is almost like watching the movie for the first time again. My equipment is pretty low tech (Panasonic DMP-BDT220 and Vizio E371VL) and the movie looks and sounds absolutely incredible. I can't imagine how much more incredible it would look on a high-end plasma or LED large screen tv, through a 7.1 sound system. Someday when I decide to spend the money, I will upgrade my tv and purchase a 7.1 sound system, and when I do, this version of Jaws will be the first movie I play through it.<br /><br />I purchased my copy at Fry's Electronics for $17.99, lower than Amazon's price. The movie is well worth the asking price, but in addition to the best looking/sounding Jaws ever, you also get some really wonderful extras, with one of the most interesting (in my opinion) being Jaws: The Restoration, which is an in-depth look at the time consuming process of restoring the movie to Blu-ray quality. Really neat stuff. The Making of Jaws 2-hour documentary is also wonderful.<br /><br />Really, Universal and all involved in the Blu-ray release of Jaws deserve major accolades for making sure the transfer was done right. As important a movie Jaws is in the lexicon of motion pictures, it deserved no less than a perfect transfer, and that's what it got. Buy it today, and behold the power of Blu-ray!</p></body></html>

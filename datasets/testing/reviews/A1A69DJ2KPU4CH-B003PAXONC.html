<meta name="summary" content="My I am Legend Disk Makes a Nice Drink Coaster"></head><body><p>Boring, cheesy, riddled with plot holes and leaps of logic, atrociously bad CGI, and poorly written.  I'm not going to delve into the plot because you can read the hundreds of other reviews on Amazon for that.  I'm simply doing my duty bringing the over-all rating of this disaster down.<br /><br />The special edition discs do however make great drink coasters so all is not lost for your ~$20.</p></body></html>

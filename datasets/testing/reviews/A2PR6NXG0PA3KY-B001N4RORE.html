<meta name="summary" content="Shucks, Why Not?"></head><body><p>A cold, gloomy, nasty afternoon in a hotel in Canada. Five hours until warm-up time in the orchestra pit. Take a walk? &iexcl;Ni modo, Quasimodo! Rent a flick? Why not!<br /><br />You'll have to believe me that I have no prior ABBA consciousness, despite the fact that I spent half my childhood in Sweden. I was in Mediterranean and Caribbean lands when they 'conquered' the Anglophone pop music world. I heard or read the name. Honestly, I thought they were another 'heavy metal' or Swedish vampyr band. I had no idea what they looked or sounded like. My wife tells me now that we danced to ABBA covers at innumerable family weddings over the past 25 years, but I never pay much attention when I'm trying to shake my booty without looking as dorky as I feel. Okay, do I suddenly love their music now, after seeing/hearing "Mamma Mia!"? Well... it's bouncy and sweet, but no way will it displace Dufay or Scarlatti on my iPod. ABBA is musically as corny as their costumes -- a 1970s period piece. Apologies to their fans, and to all Swedes everywhere. Hurray for IKEA! Hurray for ABBA! Sweden needs all the export credits it can get.<br /><br />And now the movie review! The most artful thing about Mamma Mia is the integration of the songs and chorus-line numbers into the melodrama. Reviewer JP, whose recommendation of this film was responsible for me picking it up, commented on the "Greek Chorus" of Greeks serving as a human and musical backdrop for the jet set cast of English speakers. She's right, and it was effective. I'm so far out of touch with Broadway that I thought JP's praise of the music/drama blend sounded just like Bollywood. I've seen a lot of Bollywood films. I urged JP to have a look at Lagaan, one of my favs. Bottom line? Mamma Mia is almost... almost... as artful at squeezing into and out of musical extravaganzas as Bollywood, though the ABBA songs are less appealing. Keep practicing, USA! You'll catch up with India some day.<br /><br />The story? Mildly amusing, absolutely predictable, jolly enough to keep me watching. Merle Streep looks remarkably like my sister, or vice versa. I get a kick out of the resemblance, and I was delighted to see my 'sister' having so much fun in a role. Streep's enjoyment of her own feeble singing was infectious. I was tickled to watch my usually dour countryman, Stellan Skarsg?rd, try to act zany. Zaniness is not intuitive for Swedes. Stellan and I look a lot alike, also, though I'm in better shape. I took a sardonic pleasure in watching him look hopelessly dorky when he danced. At the other extreme, the spark-plug friend of Mamma - I didn't catch her name, the tall one who can really sing and dance - is obviously a real Broadway-ite, and carried the film at times when others were looking vague about their blocking. The young'uns were cast for their looks, and look they did. Some credit has to go to the Greek Islands for the exuberance of the film also; I've spent time on Mykonos, Skiathos, Santorini, etc., and my own nostalgia for those times mixed into the characters of the three middle-aged guys who 'came back wishing they'd never left.' Too bad, now that I think of it, that there wasn't any Greek music at this Greek wedding!<br /><br />Five stars? Hey, just like it says on the box: "a hilarious, rousing & joyous celebration!"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK (SCHOOL OF ROCK SALUTES YOU)."></head><body><p>&quot;School Of Rock&quot; is a surprisingly amusing movie, not only Jack Black fans or rock aficionados are going to enjoy this film, most of the people are going to find something appealing to them in &quot;School Of Rock&quot;. The movie is a showcase for Jack Black, who proves with this comedy that he can be a very good lead actor in comedies.<br /><br /> The plot isn't specially original, but the rock soundtrack and the original music in the movie are EXCELLENT, also a lot of jokes and rock references are simply great, for instance, check out the AC/DC guitarist (Angus Young) impersonation, or Peter Townshend's trademark arm swing when a kid plays the guitar, or when Jack Black rolls in the ground while playing a guitar solo, like Jimi Hendrix did.<br /><br /> The kids actually are real musicians, and even though they are very young, they show an outstanding talent, also Jack Black is a very skilled musician and a charismatic singer as well, both Jack and the children perform their songs.<br /><br /> During the movie, we can hear songs by groups that built the foundations of rock music, the music includes rock legends like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, AC/DC, The Who, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Metallica, among many others, as well as a lot of great references to artists like Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and Yes (by the way, check out the rock history diagram drawn in a blackboard, it's a great detail).<br /><br /> Rock aficionados will enjoy &quot;School Of Rock&quot;, as well as Jack Black fans, but the movie is funny enough to appeal to most of the people.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="5 Stars just for creepiness!!"></head><body><p>This movie was downright creepy from the very start and never gives up. The baseball scene was just scary as hell cause its sad to say but you can almost picture some nut job doing that these days. It seems your kids are not safe anywhere. It has that kind of Romero feel to the story, like what Romero did with The dead series. He put alot of what was wrong with the world then into his movies, and the writers did the same with.this movie. It just creeps you out knowing this could come true in this day and age.</p></body></html>

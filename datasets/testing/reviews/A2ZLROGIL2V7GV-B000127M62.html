The big event that every horror fan has dreamt of is finally here.  Two legends duke it out to claim their glory in high body-counts.  The world isn't big enough for these two monsters, so they will have to fight until only of them walks away victorious.  While this is no Shakespearian masterpiece (nor is it trying to be one) and the movie tends to go over-the-top at times, &quot;Freddy Vs. Jason&quot; is a complete blast for those who are looking for one hell of an entertaining time.<p>The people of Elm Street have finally found a way to get rid of Freddy Krueger for good.  They've erased him from their memories.  Any evidence or witnesses to his bloodshed have been done away with or locked up; thus, making Krueger powerless.  As a sign of desperation, Freddy calls upon another legend killer; Jason Voorhees.  With Jason back from the grave and going back to his murderous ways, Freddy knows that the people of Elm Street will suspect that it is his doing and will be afraid once again; for it is their fear he craves and lives on.  The only problem is once Freddy set Jason loose, there's no stopping him.  Jason is killing all of Freddy's children and sparing none for him.  Well, Freddy is not going to take that lying down.  Freddy decides it is time to put the bad boy down for good, leading to the ultimate showdown between the two legendary monsters.<p>It's impossible for this movie to please everybody, but I for one must confess that I absolutely LOVED this movie.  This is because I accept it for what it is.  Being a huge Freddy fan, I knew exactly what it was going to be.  In fact, the movie went as far as to even surprise me with a clever and workable plot.  While it takes the film some time to get into the background story (which is really cool to see the beginnings of these two maniac killers; especially Freddy's start) and character development, once these two colossal giants go one-on-one, it is a sight to see.  There is some incredible fighting between the two that was very unexpected.  The acting in the movie isn't fantastic, but it works for what it is trying to accomplish.  You don't need excellent acting in this kind of a movie; you just need acting that is at least bearable.  I found it more than that and was pretty pleased with the end results.  Freddy and Jason are the two show-stoppers that really makes everything work.  Kudos to Robert Englund for being able to rise to the occasion of playing a marvelous &quot;Freddy&quot; for all of these years.  He hasn't lost his touch.<p>One of the big complaints about this film from people is talks of there being no winner.  Without giving away the ending, I will go on the record and say there absolutely is a winner.  It's undeniable that the ending leaves room for a second round, no doubt; however, there is most certainly a winner by the end of the film (think of it more like a round in boxing).  I think the ending is more than suitable--this referring to the exact final shot.  I'm sure some people are upset with how it ended, but I thought it ended on a fine note.<p>This two-disc DVD set has some pretty cool extras within it.  First off, the picture quality is breath-taking and crystal clear while the sound is excellent.  The DVD offers both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the movie.  Extras included are deleted scenes, commentary, trailers, a music video, some cool DVD-ROM features, and much more.  A pretty impressive package for a movie like this, I must admit.<p>&quot;Freddy Vs. Jason&quot; isn't looking to win Oscars, nor is it here for enlightenment.  It is here for us horror fans, and for us Freddy/Jason fans.  If you think the previous movies are stupid, then you will most likely think this one is as well.  If you're a fan of the past movies, then chances of you enjoying this flick are very great.  Just keep two things in mind:  Don't let hype consume you, and allow yourself to make up your own mind in the end.  This was a very entertaining chapter in the Freddy/Jason saga that I will be sure to watch over and over again.  What could've been a terrible disaster ends up being a grand and gory entertaining time.</p></body></html>

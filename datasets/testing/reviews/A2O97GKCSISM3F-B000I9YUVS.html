<meta name="summary" content="Rupert, you step well into John Carpenter's shoes...."></head><body><p>I must be in the minority here, but I don't care. Director Rupert Wainwright did much better with this than Stigmata, plus his "motive" for the fog's appearance makes more sense here, but John Carpenter's direction style is hard to beat, but RW comes close here. The acting isn't oscar-worthy, but decent, and like the original, the setting and atmosphere is very creepy when the fog arrives. I feel like a broken record here, when creators re-make<br />classics, they aren't always trying to copy the original scene for scene, scary movies are getting very predictable these days, and John Carpenter is probably old enough to retire, Wes Craven is still doing movies and they're fairly decent, yes, this includes the Scream series. Now I'm getting off track here, to make a long story short, this was yet another decent remake and I enjoyed it. However, I admire JC and Debra Hill for producing the remake, keeping the basics of the classic intact.</p></body></html>

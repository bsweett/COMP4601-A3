<meta name="summary" content="Some fun, goes nowhere"></head><body><p>This is an entertaining, professional, well-made movie on all fronts. <p>However, it seemed only a collection of odd characters and situations that really had no cohesiveness. There wasn't really much plot, except a pair of supposedly &quot;hip&quot; high-school grads who dislike most things and most people interact with a particular nerd.<p>That being said, it was an entertaining movie, and Steve Buscemi was great as Seymour - good enough to recommend the movie just for that. If you are a fan of Steve Buscemi, Thora Birch (who supposedly gained about 20 pounds for the role) or Scarlett Johansson, then you should like this movie. <p>It has enough odd-ball scenes and dialog so that most people will find something good, but the search for a meaningful overall &quot;story&quot; may be elusive - thereby assuring its status as a cult favorite.</p></body></html>

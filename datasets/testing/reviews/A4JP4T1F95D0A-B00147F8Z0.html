I couldn't even tell if the special effects were any good, because I had trouble just trying to make out what was happening.  The story takes place in modern times which pre-dates all of the alien movies, but comes after the Predator stories.  The Predator/Alien hybrid is running amok along with several aliens and a revenge minded Predator.  I think the story took many liberties with the mythology of these races.  1.  Aliens have interacted with other alien creatures before and they always just hatch as standard aliens unless genetically tampered with.  2.  Multiple aliens bursting from the chest/stomach.  3.  The hybrid also has queen egg laying powers, but forgoes the egg and face hugger stage.  4.  The time for an alien from incubation to birth to full growth seems to have been sped up to about 10 minutes for this film.  What I liked about the film was the glimpse at the Predator home world and the ending(though I have seen it before in Return of the Living Dead).  What I didn't like was the frantic direction and the awful dialog in places.  This one is a miss.</p></body></html>

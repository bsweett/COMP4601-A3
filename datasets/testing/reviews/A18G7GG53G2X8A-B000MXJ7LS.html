<meta name="summary" content="September 11: The Soap Opera"></head><body><p>There's no denying that September 11, 2001 was a dark, dark day, marked by needless violence and untimely deaths. I don't have a problem with a film being made out of it as long as it's respectful and unbiased. Oliver Stone has repeatedly said that he made "World Trade Center" with no political agenda in mind, and before seeing the movie, I was willing to believe him. Call me naive, but I just didn't think it possible for someone to be that disrespectful. Then I actually saw the film, and the truth of the matter came to light. It's overwhelmingly political, unfairly toying with the emotions of the audience by presenting a feel-good survival story. This is a preachy, cliche-ridden, melodramatic film, and it tugs at our heartstrings without any degree of integrity.<br /><br />This is the second film of the year to document the 9/11 attacks, the first being Paul Greengrass' "United 93." That was a much better film, presenting the facts in a straightforward way without relying on heavy emotion or big name actors. It didn't make a political statement; it just focused on the action, confusion, and chaos. The best thing about it was the way it ended; it didn't linger on the tragedy of the crash by showing depressing images of burning wreckage. We didn't even see the moment of impact. That was the absolute right way to go because the ultimate fate of the passengers is well established. Why prolong the sorrow by actually showing the end result? It was almost like documentary footage, and that was probably why it was such a fascinating film.<br /><br />This is more than I can say for "World Trade Center," which documents the real life Search and Rescue mission of Port Authority police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno (played by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena). While evacuating the North Tower of the World Trade Center, the building collapses, ultimately trapping them beneath thousands of tons of rubble. Remarkably, they survive (other team members were not so lucky). While lying in the wreckage, the two start a number of conversations, all of which inevitably lead to discussions of their wives, their children, and their attempts to stay alive. Haven't we heard this kind of dialogue before in other disaster movies? Did we really need to hear it all again in a film documenting a real disaster?<br /><br />I obviously don't know what the men actually said to each other that day, but I had a very hard time believing that anything said in this movie was accurate. Screenwriter Andrea Berloff loaded each line with cliches that only pass muster in sappy buddy flicks. I got so tired of hearing lines like, "We're gonna make it!" or "If you die, I die!" coming from Cage and Pena, and I definitely could have done without the, "Tell my wife I love her," sermons. There was no originality to this dialogue whatsoever; it was as flat and unimpressive as something written by an amateur. Even the way specific characters interact made use of worn out storytelling methods; when McLoughlin's wife waits in the hospital for word of her husband's condition, she runs into another woman who feels guilty because she yelled at her son. It was the last form of communication they had before he entered the World Trade Center. How convenient; the two found each other just as the audience is hoping for McLoughlin's safe return.<br /><br />McLoughlin, Jimeno, and their wives Donna and Alyssa (played by Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) were involved with the film's production. Donna is quoted as saying, "We got involved because we felt it needed to be done accurately. We wanted to do the right thing and I think the filmmakers wanted to do the right thing too." I wonder if she said this knowing just how far Stone wanted to go with the melodrama; at a certain point, Jimeno closes his eyes and sees the image of a blurry, heavily lit Jesus carrying a bottle of water. I found that incredibly inappropriate; an image like that only encourages a biased mode of thinking.<br /><br />Interwoven with the scenes of McLoughlin and Jimeno are scenes of their wives. They're both understandably panicked; they know for sure that both men entered the towers, but for most of the film, they don't know whether or not they survived. They struggle with conflicting emotions, going back and forth from desperate to cautiously optimistic. As the day turns to evening and then to night, they both experience flashbacks. Of course, they remember the good moments, like frightened wives always do in films like this. There's the moment when McLoughlin teaches his son the right way to saw wood. There's the moment when Jimeno and Alyssa lie in bed discussing what they should name their next baby (Alyssa is five months pregnant during the film). There's even the moment when McLoughlin is on the roof and he accidentally bangs his hand with a hammer. He and Donna look at each other with classic spousal love: a perfect moment for the audience to feel even more upset than they already are.<br /><br />And then there's Dave Karnes, a military officer played by Michael Shannon. When we first see him, he's in a church staring up at a cross while telling the pastor that he needs to go to Ground Zero and help. This is clearly a noble, courageous thing to do. I praise the real Dave Karnes for lending a hand; New York certainly needed all the help it could get. But I had many problems with the film Karnes. The fact that church was where he made a vow to "fight the enemy" was in no way subtle on Stone's part. You can't include a scene like that and then expect me to believe this movie has no political agenda.<br /><br />I'm in no way denying the reality or the scope of that terrible day, nor am I denying the fact that "World Trade Center" portrays it with extreme poignancy. The problem is that every moment is so heavy handed that it manipulates the audience into submission. There are many scenes that are so touching that they overwhelm us, which in turn distracts us from realizing we're being played like harps. This is not a respectful reinterpretation of a true story; this is an over the top soap opera, made with the intention of turning the audience into weepy drones. September 11 was a national tragedy. If a film is going to be made about that day, it at least should show some decency; the last thing the victims' families need is to be robbed of their dignity. It's the last thing the American public needs.<br /><br />Too bad Oliver Stone didn't think of this when making "World Trade Center"; it's such a shallow film, coming off only as an excuse for unnecessary melodrama. I urge you not to waste your tears on it. It doesn't deserve praise, nor does it deserve respect. What it does deserve is a quick death at the box office.</p></body></html>

I rented this movie, because I can remember seeing publicity photos and/or previews, of the tall actor, with his nose in some sort of bandage. I expected this to be some sort of screwball comedy, with physical comedy thrown in for good measure!<br /><br />Damn, I almost fell asleep.  I am like the review before me; except I was alone.  I kept looking around mouthing the words:  "Is it me?  It's them, right?" as I gestured toward the convoluted conversations coming from my home viewing screen.  Sorry, but watching two white guys discuss wine for 2+ achingly boring hours is not my idea of an award winning movie!  I guess the saving grace is seeing the Asian woman, and imagining the "freaky" activities going on behind closed doors.  But what a schmuck that guy was, as it was the weekend before his wedding.<br /><br />Also, I didn't appreciate how there was no damn explanation of what these two goofballs were doing, driving across California, to various wineries.  What the hell was going on?  This is how some horny white guy spends his last weekend of freedom?  How about living a little, going to a strip club, or even taking in a Broadway show?  But sitting in restaurants, and tasting booths?  Nah ahh!  Homie don't play that.<br /><br />And neither does MC White<br /><br />MC White said: an extra star for the Asian hottie.  Other than that, two thumbs WAY down!!!<br /><br />Please note: it was this movie that caused this reviewer to go through his 300+ queue of on-line rental DVD movies, and delete all non -Absolutely sure I want to watch them" stinkfest movies.  I'm not taking a chance on any movie again!  So glad I don't go to the theater anymore and pay outrageous ticket prices for this garbage!!!<br /><br />An Official MC White EDIT; 12/19/2006:  I knew there was a reason I'm friends with my buddy Bobby Asslong.  I just spoke to him yesterday about this film, and while we don't always see eye to eye, and his reviews are normally pretty bad, he and I were right on with this one.  He thought it sucked too.  Bad movie!</p></body></html>

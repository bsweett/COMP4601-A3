<meta name="summary" content="EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!!"></head><body><p>what can i say that hasn't been said already. well my piece i guess. this movie was built with so much hype, and let me tell you it sure as hell lived up to it. the original was great, and this remake was terrific. it really can't get better than this concerning remakes. it blew me away. really scary, and creepy. and the fact that it's inspired by true events makes it even scarier to know that stuff like this really isn't only in the movies. how realer can it get. it's crazy, this world has it's share of locos. anyway, this is at the top of my list. if you were asking to be scared, to get goosebumps, to get the chills, and cringe then i'm sure you got it after seeing this piece of work. great job michael bay for bringing back leatherface and his best friend the chainsaw. of course it follows closely to the original, but with a few details changed here and there, and of course the cast and an even more psychotic family. the young actors were good, and jessica biel did a insanely good job. she screamed her head off, and she made you scared for her. she got tough and she did all she could to survive at all cost. teens stop in a small backwoods town full of locos, but they don't realize it, and that's when the nightmare begins. it's beyond their worst nightmare, and some don't live to tell the tale. the ending was very good. at least they felt a piece of what they've been putting out for so long. it's movies like this that make you take the highway and no short cuts, or out of the way turns. it's because of leatherface that people avoid itty bitty towns lost in the woods. great job.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'Star Power' Makes For A Hip, Cool, Entertaining Movie"></head><body><p>...The movie is ten times better than the mediocre original. Danny Ocean(George Clooney), is released from prison. It doesn't take long for him to get back to his old ways. He devises a plan to steal $163 million dollars from the tightly guarded vault of the Las Vegas casino The Bellagio. To do so, he needs to round up a crew of men to pull this very tough heist off. Enter the rest of the 'Star Power' cast. Brad Pitt plays Clooney's right hand man, Rusty Ryan. Matt Damon plays a talented pocket picker named Linus. Don Cheadle really has a nothing role, but makes up for it with his lively and entertaining accent. Comedy legend Carl Reiner is also on hand as an aging thief. Comedian Bernie Mac(one of the stars of &quot;The Kings Of Comedy&quot; film)is one of the gang as well. Andy Garcia plays Terry Benedict, the owner of the casino they are going to hit. Terry is now with Danny's ex Tess, played by Julia Roberts. There isn't anything new with the film really, but who cares?. It was designed to be a fun crowd pleaser from beginning to end. It delivers on all sides. There are numerous one liners that come fast and sharp. The actors deliver them with full force. The funniest gag is Pitt's character teaching young T.V. stars how to play poker. Those stars being Joshua Jackson from &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;, Topher Grace from &quot;That 70's Show&quot;, Holly Marie Combs from &quot;Charmed&quot;, Barry Watson from &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, and Shane West from &quot;Once And Again&quot;. The &quot;Chewing Scenery&quot; award goes to Elliot Gould, who plays a casino owner equipped with big glasses, cigar, and lots of jewelry sprawled out in dark chest hair. It's a comical highlight. Good for him. Reiner gives a wonderful performance. It's nice to see the legend has still got it. Our stars are wonderful too. Clooney brings new meaning to the word &quot;charming&quot;. If there was anyone to have that cool, calm charm like Sinatra, it's Clooney. Pitt is enjoyable as well. The only fault this film has is the horrendous underuse of Damon and Roberts. People will be surprised to learn how small this Oscar winning mega star has. Could've been used so much better. Garcia balances his villain role just right. He stays on line and doesn't whoop it up and make it seem like some cheesy caricature of characters gone by. A nice, rather subdued, performance. I can't stress enough how much of a good time the film is. Director Steven Soderbergh is on fire. He films the town nicely, and, of course, the stars. It's almost hard to imagine this was the same guy who did &quot;Traffic&quot;. Ocean's 11 might not be Oscar material, but it is most definitley the nicest, most insanely entertaining film so far this year. Hands down. No if's, and's, or but's about it. It would definitley not be a bad thing to have an Ocean's 12, or 13, 14, 15, 16. This is a movie for people who like movies. If, like the one star negative reviews are any indication, you hate movies, then you will probably hate this one too. Ignore those reviews. Those are grouches who don't enjoy good, quality films.</p></body></html>

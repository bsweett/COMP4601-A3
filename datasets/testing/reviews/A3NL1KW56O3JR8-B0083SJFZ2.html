<meta name="summary" content="Not an improvement"></head><body><p>The only saving grace for this movie (and the only reason I didn't give it one star) is the special effects. Everything else is pretty bad. I saw the original when I was a kid and (based on what I can remember), I think the original was better (and the original wasn't that good). This movie is not an improvement and not worth the money.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></body></html>

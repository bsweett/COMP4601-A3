It grabs you by the throat and never let it go. But I'm gonna talk about Season Two.<br /><br />This show ended for me the moment the characters begun to make totally absurd, egotistical, no-sense decisions going against what we have learned about them in the first season. The pinneacle of these absurds ocurred at the moment that Michael killed Ana Lucia. Michael, a character we learned to admire due to his love for his missing son. My jaw simply dropped in astonishment... it was absurd, useless, it broke plot coerence, it was a twist just for the sake of twisting, nothing more.  From this moment on I simply do not care anymore about this show. Good luck for all of you who wil kkep watching it.</p></body></html>

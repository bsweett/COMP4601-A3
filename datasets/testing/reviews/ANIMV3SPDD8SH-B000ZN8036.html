<meta name="summary" content="THE LONG WAY HOME"></head><body><p>This film is as earnest as a Mark Trails nature comic book adventure, but in telling the true story of Christopher McCandless, a college graduate who abandons convention and a promising career to hitchhike and live in the Alaskan wilderness, director Sean Penn, films a beautiful movie void of psychological or spiritual conviction, even while gorgeous landscapes, eagles soaring against the Alaskan sun, oddball eccentric Ameriana road characters pepper in, and a genuine empathy prevails for McCandless' compulsion to walk into the wild woods. There is a nagging doubt that underneath this nature loving idealist, who disappears without a trace to embark on his adventure,  lies a malice aimed at his concerned family who live in grief for years unknowing of his whereabouts and fate.<br /><br />In fact, Penn's inistence to include the McCandless family, (professional, upper-scale, worried sick about their missing son), prominently in the narrative is a superflous reminder of the past when a few well chosen words of dialogue would prevail. We want the great Alaskan wilderness adventure, and while we get that, we also get a whole lot of generation gap family soap which is suspect to significance. Scenes like the cap-throwing college graduation do little but make this a very long movie.<br /><br />We feel for McCandless in much the same way we feel for "Grizzly Man',the psycholgically leveraging photographer who also went into the Alaskan  wilderness, believing he could commune with the wild bears, but instead was eaten by them. Likewise McCandless had severe mental issues, that went beyond the call of the wild, in luring him to a wilderness camp where he was inept at hunting and eating wild game, unable to tell a poisonous plant from an edible one, and lived in an abandoned bus begging for a lead paint intolerance. Penn's god-like vistas of the great wilderness are in innoculated contrast to the frail, doomed, self renamed Alexander Supertramp.<br /><br />I expected to love this movie, and while I never even disliked it, (it's a cabin in the woods thing), in retrospect, the haunting image of the real McCandless at the end of the film, leaves him a sad and nearly pathetic man. Is this the intention of the film? To wonder what he was really running away from? When I was 19, I packed a bag and walked and hitchhiked the continental U.S. from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. I too was looking for something but I trust it was not a desire to become a second-rate Thoreau. The film refuses to speculate on where McCandless' intention lied, or where his pain began. It has however conjured in me an absolute respect for him. In peace, bro -</p></body></html>

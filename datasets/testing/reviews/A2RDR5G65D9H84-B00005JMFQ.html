<meta name="summary" content="The perfect romantic comedy"></head><body><p>The movie shows a collection of stories that at first seem independent of each other, but we start seeing interrelationships as the action advances. The narrator is trying to demonstrate that love is everywhere and that is why he is &quot;telling&quot; us all these different anecdotes. <p>I have always favored British humor, and in this case I was not let down, since some of the situations are absolutely hilarious. There are almost no words to describe the unbelievable cast, which includes actors like Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Colin Firth, among many others.<p>David (Hugh Grant) is the new British Prime Minister and upon his arrival at his new &quot;home&quot; is captivated by Natalie, his new personal assistant. Bill is a singer at the end of his career trying to make a come back with a Christmas hit by adapting the lyrics of an old hit to make it a Christmas song. Peter and Juliet got married recently, and Peter's best friend, Mark, is having trouble dealing with this new event because he holds a secret that can destroy everything. Colin, a young impetuous guy, is looking for love and decides that his best option is to go to America, where the girls are &quot;easier&quot;. <p>Daniel (Neeson) has recently lost his wife and is trying to surge into clarity again while taking care of Samuel, his beloved stepson. At the same time, Samuel has a crush on a girl at school and is very serious about it, seeking Daniel's help for his quest. Sarah is in love with one of her co-workers, but has a burden that makes her life very complicated. Finally, Jamie is an author, who found his wife cheating on him with his brother, and looked for refuge in France. Here he meets Aurelia, a Portuguese girl that works as his maid.<p>This is the best romantic comedy I have seen in the last few years. The dialogues are funny and witty, the cast is first class and there is not one dull moment in the whole film. As a final note, just watching the scene in which Hugh Grant dances, makes this movie worth seeing!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good, but a little short..."></head><body><p>Recently we went to see Tim Burton's Corpse Bride. It's a stop-motion animation flick, similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas.<br /><br />It's thoroughly entertaining, great family fare. The only knocks I have against it are its length--it is short--and it has a pretty linear and predictable plot. The voice actors turn in good performances. Danny Elfman does a great job, as always, with the music. The movie features a great colour scheme, evoking a grey, Victorian style in the land of the living, and a more colourful land of the dead.<br /><br />It's a great family film, as I said. However, it could be scary for very young kids. Kids under 5 shouldn't be at the movies anyways.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The story, the scream, the ape."></head><body><p>King Kong, how could you forget it? 72 years ago, it was a landmark in film history.<br /><br /> THE STORY: A film maker, his crew, and the sexy blonde, Ann Darrow, head to the mysterious Skull Island to shoot a film there, only to find out that this island is inhabited by natives, giant creatures, and a giant ape known as Kong!<br /><br /> OPINION: Still great after all these years. Still suspenseful, captivating, and action packed. You gotta love the scream from Ann, too!<br /><br /> So if you have not seen it, see it now! And see the new remake by Peter Jackson, coming next week.<br /><br />SOME FUN FACTS ABOUT KK: The special effects are pretty unique. Kong is a scale model that's only 18 inches. They used stop motion. The movement of the monsters are pretty funky and fun to watch. Kong's roar is a lion's and tiger's roar combined and played backwards. Grossed $90,000 its opening weekend - the biggest opening ever at the time. Was voted the 47th Greatest Film of all time by Entertainment Weekly.</p></body></html>

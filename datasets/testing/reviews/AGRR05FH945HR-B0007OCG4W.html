<meta name="summary" content="Great cast, dark movie"></head><body><p>To be honest, my favorite part was the beautiful video 'The Blower's Daughter' by Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan, in the Special Features...<br /><br />Closer is a movie that just doesn't live up to the premise or the potential generated by such an outstanding cast. While it plays with contrasting the Apollonian versus Dionysian energies of the two male characters, and the interplay of the scattered energies that the colliding relationships create, it somehow falls short of working, for me.<br /><br />Yes, it's about the futility of obsession, as was Lolita, and the underlying purity of Natalie Portman's character hints at a tip of the literary hat to Goethe's Faust, but Closer never settles into a believable flow.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, Jude Law's Dan actually has the chance to be happy with both women at different times, but blows it by obsessing over details and control issues. So does the Sleazy Doc, but in a different way.<br /><br />Life is not about 'cheat but don't tell', it's about 'don't cheat', as Portman's Alice/Jane rightly suggested - that there is always a pivotal moment when you can stop yourself from falling in love inappropriately or creating an inappropriate  sexual liaison.<br /><br />Just be glad you are not inside their heads.</p></body></html>

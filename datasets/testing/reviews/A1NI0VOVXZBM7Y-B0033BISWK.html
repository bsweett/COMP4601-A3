<meta name="summary" content="District 9"></head><body><p>Not my cup of tea,would recommend to die-hard scifi fans. I should have known since Peter Jackson(Lord of the rings EW!) presents it, and this is a rookie director's first movie(hopefully the last? or no sequel)The movie is not bad, it's just the message that somehow Human beings are bad and greedy. That we would use alien technology,etcera. Another one of those deep social messages like avatar. First off, If it were aliens they would do the same thing.<br />Second, Yes it's science fiction. but poor science fiction. sorry but I don't want preachy over-lying "Anti-Imperialist" themes that are so passe.</p></body></html>

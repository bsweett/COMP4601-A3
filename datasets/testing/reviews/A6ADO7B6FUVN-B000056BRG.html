<meta name="summary" content="One of Cinema History's Most Renowned and Expensive Titles..."></head><body><p>Ben-Hur is one of cinema history's most renowned and expensive titles that swept the house at the Oscars in 1960.  The only nomination it did not win was the best-adapted screenplay, which went to Room at the Top (1959), but it successfully claimed eleven other Oscars, including best film and best actor.  Charlton Heston brought the agonizing struggles of the Jewish prince Ben-Hur to life through his excruciating search to find an outlet for his internalized pain brought upon him by the Roman oppression.  Compared to contemporary performances by Hollywood actors such a Sean Penn or Tim Robbins, Heston appears stiff and rigid in his performance.  However, Heston's inflexibility in front of the camera is a perfect match for the character, as Ben-Hur suffers a tragic journey of endless loss and grief.<br /><br />A map and the voice of the narrator (Finlay Currie) help clarify the major historical aspects of the Roman Empire and the importance of Jesus Christ's birth at the time.  It is an intriguingly multifaceted opening that presents immensely detailed background of the two major characters Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd).  The tale of Ben-Hur rests on a foundation based on General Lew Wallace's novel that runs parallel to the life of Jesus Christ, which also intertwines the existence of Ben-Hur and Jesus.  Through the infusion of Jesus into the story, it also provides a meaningful perspective of Christian philosophy.  The moral message in the film, heavily applies the great injustice and difficulty that Ben-Hur has to endure, which leaves the audience with several notions to ponder.<br /><br />Ben-Hur and Messala, once childhood friends, discover that that life has come to a crossroads where both have decided on their own path.  However, before they part they reunite when the Roman Messala returns to the Judea, as the new garrison commander for the Roman Empire in Judea.  When Messala commands his friend Ben-Hur to give up the names of some Jews that are resisting the Roman Empire, their friendship ends, as Ben-Hur decides on the righteous path while keeping the names a secret.  Further predicaments emerge when the new governor arrives, as Ben-Hur's mother and sister are put under arrest while he finds himself being sentenced to a life as a rower on one of the Roman galleys.  Unaware of his family's fate and several painful years behind the oar Ben-Hur's hate grows stronger for the Roman Empire, which is responsible of his agonizing destiny.<br /><br />Through Ben-Hur's existence and struggle director William Wyler creates a visual journey where emotions runs free and passionate anger feeds the hate of the protagonist.  However, Ben-Hur will find a moment for the vengeance he is seeking through luck, or maybe with the help of God. In either case, it will have a profound affect on Ben-Hur, as he will cross his path with the Christian philosophy.  This leaves the audience with a remarkable adventure of unfortunate luck and numerous moral thoughts to contemplate.<br /><br />Ben-Hur was at the time, the most expensive film of all times produced by MGM, which was facing bankruptcy when the film was made.  However, this epic spiritual journey of Ben-Hur helped save the Hollywood company out of financial abyss, as the film grossed record amounts of money.  Together with several aspects of filmmaking Wyler directed a film that has an unforgettable score, awesome cinematography, terrific mise-en-scene, and an excellent chariot scene that will go down as one of the best races in film history.  Besides these cinematic facets, an excellent cast dynamically enhances the intriguing elements in the film and will leave the audience thoroughly entertained and deep in thoughts.</p></body></html>

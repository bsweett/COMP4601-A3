<meta name="summary" content="A great Sci Fi classic Remastered on Blu Ray Disc!!!"></head><body><p>NOTE,this review is for the 2007 "Remastered" Blu Ray Disc of The Fifth Element,NOT the 2006 release that's now out of print,the way to tell if it's the Remastered version is the new release says 2007 on the Blu Ray case!!! This 2007 Remastered Blu ray is the one to get because there was problems with the earlier 2006 version!!! This new one has awesome picture and sound that only Blu-ray Disc can deliver,though it's lacking in the extras(just a trivia track and a few trailers)department,a bit of a bummer(so keep your Ultimate Edtion 2-DVD superbit(which is no sloutch either) set if you have it for the extras),but it's still a heck of a Blu Ray Disc!!! Recommended!!! two thumbs up!!! A+</p></body></html>

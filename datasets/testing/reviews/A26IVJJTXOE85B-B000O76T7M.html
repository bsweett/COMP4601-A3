YOU DON'T SAY A REVIEW ISN'T HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE OPINION EXPRESSED! GET A LIFE!<br /><br />i thought i'd hate this film but i actually ended up liking it more than alien ressurection and predator 2. i was amazed at how into the movie i was and how well the action was, being that it was pg 13. i liked the story and thought it was a pretty good idea, the whole right of passage thing and the link to the aztecs and egyptians. my only problem is during the last half hour, the whole team up with the human and predator could have been acted out more convincingly. i also didn't need the leading actress to do the arnold swarzanegger line "you're one ugly mfer" it came across so lame, it pissed me off. this lady could never fill arnold's shoes!!! other than that it is a good movie and it was great to see bishop again and i loved his dying scene. "don't turn your back on me!" flame thrower! also this movie feels more suspenseful than Resurrection and Predator 2, which is what these movies should be all about. what trips me out the most about this film is that Dan O'Bannon wrote this film, who wrote the original Alien. Cool!</p></body></html>

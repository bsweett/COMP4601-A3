<meta name="summary" content="An intelligent, sometimes humorous film"></head><body><p>Lord of War follows the exploits of Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian immigrant to America in the early 1980s.  Yuri decides to get into the gun-running business when he sees an attempted assassination of a ganglord one day in his hometown.  The movie follows Yuri's story over the course of 20 years.  All the highs and lows of the business, and the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />This movie is definitely not an action adventure.  It really is more of a satire; a serious, violent satire, but still a satire.  Somehow, the movie allows, even encourages us, to root for Nicolas Cage's ruthless, exploitative character.  Yuri is a good, deep character, who is aware of his flaws, but he is also aware that gun-running is the one thing he is good at, and he is not so willing to give it up.  Nicolas Cage is obviously a talented actor, and he does a good job here, but nothing that he hasn't done the basics of before.  Jared Leto, who plays Yuri's brother, Vitoli, does an admirable job of playing a distressed, drugged-out, morally aware sidekick to his brother's illegalities.  The best character of the movie, though, is agent Jack Valentine, played by Ethan Hawke.  Valentine appears sparingly, but the scenes that he and Cage share are the best of the movie.  The verbal sparring between the characters is extremely well-written, and has a deep meaning that runs underneath the entire film.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie expecting nonstop action and explosions, watch it for the ideas that it expands on, and the moral dilemmas it exposes.  The film asks many questions, and the answers are complicated.  But one thing is for sure: I enjoyed watching the questions get asked.</p></body></html>

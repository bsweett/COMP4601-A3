<meta name="summary" content=""The Oceans Are Battlefields": Beautiful and Majectic"></head><body><p>See this opening credit.  Three big powers of Hollywood --  Miramax, Universal, and 20th Century Fox -- joined forces to produce "Master and Commander," a thrilling adventure tale of HMS Surprise, led by Captain Jack Aubrey, set in 1805.  He is ordered to capture (or sink) the formidable emeny ship the Acheron, without any support from other ships.<p>The story, based on Patric O'Brien books, is simple.  Russell Crowe's Captain is determined to chase the Acheron, whatever it takes, and in the following two hours you see the fierce battles, and very brief, quiet time of peace.  Paul Bettany is doctor of the ship, and Captain's most trusted friend, and their friendship also plays the major part of the film.<p>But you want to know whether the battle scenes of the film deserve your time and money.  They do.  The authentic descriptions of the fighting on the sea in the 19th century, when good use of the wind and the cannonballs decided the winner, are presented with confidence and tact.  They are not bloody as the real ones perhaps, but the danger of being there is easily felt.<p>My complaint is the film's occasional lull (including the literal one), in which the onward action so far, suddenly without warning, changes to a different theme.  When you think a chase between the two ships is about to start, the scene switches to a big storm.  When you think the ship is heading south, nearing the icy continent, you find the ship had already changed its course, going north.  This quick change, with episodic mode, comes probably from the way of adaptation of the original books, which are too long to be put into film.<p>Russell Crowe (who put on weight for the role) is always good at playing this kind of character with machismo, and that's no surprise when he is so perfect, but more astonishing is Paul Bettany, who underwent the complete transformation from his past gangster No. 1 images to a thoroughly intelligent Dr. Maturin.  You recongnize in him no "MC Chaucer" he did "Knight's Tale," and that is amazing.  <p>Peter Weir's direction is assured and well-paced, but to some the film's pace looks too slow at first.  He does not hurry to show the excitement of the battles or storm, and that shows his unshaken confidence in the material.  In fact, "Master and Commander" is a good case of "the images tell everything," and to watch it is like seeing a majectic battleship gliding gracefully on the ocean.  And it's so beautiful.</p></body></html>

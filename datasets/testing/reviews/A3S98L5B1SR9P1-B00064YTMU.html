<meta name="summary" content="One of the best action films of 2004"></head><body><p>The acting was great by all actors involved. You felt that the actors were really the characters they were playing as supposed to "Hey look, it's Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx." The story was well written and well executed. The best thing was that it was believable, there was no matrix moves, no superhero antics, no special effects to make up for poor acting. The only draw back is that the ending was predictable. I agree with the critics however, they dont make movies like this anymore.<br /><br />There were some 'laugh out loud' scenes that brought some comic relief throughout the movie, my favorite being the cab radio dialogue between Max, Max's boss, and Vincent, after Max's taxi sustained some windshield damage. Also enjoyed the soundtrack. This is a definite must see.</p></body></html>

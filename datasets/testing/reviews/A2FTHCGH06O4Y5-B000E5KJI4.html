<meta name="summary" content="good example of Sturgeon's Law"></head><body><p>Somebody once leveled the following criticism of science fiction against sci-fi author Theodore Sturgeon:  "ninety percent of everything written in sci-fi is crud."  To which Sturgeon supposedly replied, "But ninety percent of EVERYTHING is crud!"<br /><br />The remark took on a life of its own, and now even has it's own Wikipedia page as "Sturgeon's Law."<br /><br />Anyhow, Brad Pitt's "Troy" is an good example of it.<br /><br />About 10% is fantastic and really worth seeing, especially if you're reading the Iliad and would just like to get some good visuals:<br /><br />1.  Achilles killing the Thessalian hero at the beginning.<br />2.  All the ships sailing upon Troy.<br />3.  The actual sack of Troy.<br /><br />But the other 90%?  Crud.</p></body></html>

In  it they spent around thirty minutes showing guys in masks as they carried shovels for said thirty minutes, and the end of that made me wonder why the extra "steam shoveling" was added to the mix. When I watched Van Helsing I thought the same thing, wondering why the movie had to keep going and going when I thought it should have ended. Still, that didn't stop it from playing on and on or me from almost following my urge to fast-forward.<br /><br />As far as a premise, the movie started off pretty well. I liked Hugh as Van Helsing, and I liked his little run-in with Mr. Hyde as an introduction. I also liked some of the weapons he carried, and the fact that he was a flawed character when it came to methods of "killing." It honestly had some humor to it. I also liked the way the movie started out, working in a variety of monsters into a B-movie frame, and how some of the effects made a few of the monsters look good. That, however, didn't make up for the problems that the movie had.<br /><br />As the movie progressed, there were some real flaws in the story and the characters. First, there was the inherent weakness in the "strong female" persona, and mostly because she wasn't strong. She was touted as someone that could do some damage, but most of the movie involved her running into trouble and Helsing bailing her out. Blah. If I needed that stereotype, I could tune into so many other shows. Second, there was the plot that started to drag in the middle of the movie, got really old at about the three quarters mark, and actually bored me enough that I thought about turning it off when the "climactic battle" took place. It had so many stupid things gearing up and running parallel to one another, and that jumble did the movie a disservice by fragmenting what was once interesting and making it dull and lifeless.<br /><br />I've heard different people with different notions on the movie, and some of my friends actually enjoyed it. So, perhaps there is something in it and I just expected to much out of the showing. I didn't think so, not really thinking there would be more than a B-movie with a budget, but who knows. Then again, one of those people was the same one that kept making me watch the show with the horses and wouldn't turn it off, so i know where that got me.</p></body></html>

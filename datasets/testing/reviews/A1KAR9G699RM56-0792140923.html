<meta name="summary" content="Waiting for You Know... Forrest Gump."></head><body><p>Forrest Gump, is the story of a man who is not that smart, but not "stupid" either.  He has no agenda, no plans, just a love of life and all that is in it.  He is the modern symbol of innocence, and that is why he became such a symbol after the movie release.<br /><br />The director traces time from the 50's I'd say all the way to the 70's, with tons of music along the journey.  The film was highly effective, although was often seen more as a comic endeavor.  Too many young people overlooked the overriding tale of innocence in a crazy and sin-filled world.<br /><br />Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, is contrasted against his life-long love Jenny, played by Robin Wright Penn.  Jenny experiences all of the mood swings of American culture, i.e., hippie culture, drug life, and so on.  However, Forrest, although he is much more face to face with the most gripping of realities, such as Vietnam and presidential assassinations, never strays from his half-minded yet picture perfect view of reality.<br /><br />I really liked the attempt that this movie made with the story of everlasting innocence and love; however, too many were distracted by Forrest's many guffaws, specifically his speech impediment.  In addition, many believe this to have a great soundtrack, but combining a vast variety of songs that were popular is not original, instead a score could have been extensively used throughout the entire film instead of using clippings of 60's/70's popular hits no matter how much we liked them.<br /><br />Also, we probably got the message way before the film was over and thus could have skipped parts of the film and been just the same.  Lastly, I did not like the hype, and was sick of all the people quoting the film.  Now, I only saw this film a few days ago, and for many that is shocking; however, this film was not as powerful as people pre-suppose.<br /><br />Yes, this film was good.  Maybe it will one day be a classic, but right now this is just a quality shrimp in a more-or-less lousy catch.</p></body></html>

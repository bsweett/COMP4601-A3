<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man Strikes Gold"></head><body><p>I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time). He makes the hero a very human character.<br /><br />Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.<br /><br />The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.<br /><br />And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy. He does it very well.</p></body></html>

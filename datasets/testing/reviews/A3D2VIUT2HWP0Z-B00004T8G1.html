<meta name="summary" content="Pick your Colour: This is a GOOD  film"></head><body><p>After a watch of the film with whatever cover colour you want, this is a great piece of work.<br /><br />The end product delivers the goods in so many different ways.<br /><br />Whilst it is most definitely a thriller, it is a thriller on a par with none, and most importantly, it is based on a real historical event, but motivated by a trip to Stone Henge.<br /><br />The Documentary features reveal much about the two stage  process that was used in production. The commentary covers as much as any film fan could hope to want in this DVD. The Features deliver interviews done at the time of the original release, and Three very good  reasons to see the film are Adrienne Barbeau ( the actual Lead in the Script), The ever loveable Jamie Lee, and her superbly Gorgous Mom... oh, and a great and spooky film story that is ramped up by Rob Bottins great FX, Hal Holbrooks superb Performance, and some very good second unit work, to supplement the mood created by the main production work.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></body></html>

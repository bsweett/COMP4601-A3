<meta name="summary" content="R.E.:  Apocalypse POW!!!"></head><body><p>Not oftern does a sequel surpass the first.  This IS one exception.  More characters from the game appear in this one, and there is a lot of action.  It's non-stop, a rollercoaster ride into hell and back.<br /><br />Cast performs well.  The critters are great.  In a year full of good zombie films, this one stands out on its own.  The plot is more complex than the first.  Project nemesis is in full throttle and our heroes now have a new enemy to battle as well as the flesh eating ghouls.  For horror fans, lotsa blood and goo.  For actioneers it's even better.  lottsa fun.  Eat popcorn, press play, enjoy.</p></body></html>

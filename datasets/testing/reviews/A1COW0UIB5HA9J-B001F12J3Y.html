<meta name="summary" content="Excellent animated movie despite difficult animation!"></head><body><p>A young boy named Billy (Hayden McFarland) who wants to believe in Santa Claus gets his wish as a magical train and the conductor (Tom Hanks) gives him a ticket to hop aboard the magic train to the North Pole with other children especially the fast talking nerd boy named Know-it-all (Voiced by Eddie Deezen) as they head on an all till midnight journey to see Santa Claus before he leaves to give them their gifts.<br /><br />A magicial, imaginative and well done CGI animated fantasy that is very faithful to the popular kids book by Chris Van Allan. This is one of the first attempts at photorealism in CGI animation before Avatar perfected it, it feels a little plastic and crooked at times but who cares. Tom Hanks plays all 5 different characters and even has a voice by Steven Tyler in two roles, Robert Zemeckis has made an enjoyable and wonderful Christmas treat for everyone.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers stunning quality picture and flawless sound like if you saw it in theaters and of course there's great extras like trailer, featurettes, and motion capture segments.</p></body></html>

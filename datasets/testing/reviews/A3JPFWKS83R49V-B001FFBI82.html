<meta name="summary" content="Boredom During War: A Fate Worse than Death"></head><body><p>Jarhead is a movie based on the book of the same name, written by Anthony Swofford. Swofford was a sniper in the Gulf War conflict and he wrote his book as a collection of memoirs, describing the day to day occurrences while fighting in this short war.<br /><br />This movie is based on Swofford's true story and it lets the viewer see what it was like to be a marine in the Gulf War, from the perspective of one man and his recounting of the events. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford in the movie and he offers his thoughts by narrating the movie at different points, allowing the viewer to better understand the thoughts that pass through a man's head when death and destruction are just around the corner.<br /><br />One thing about Jarhead that makes it different from other war movies is the lack of much combat action. There are only a few shooting and fighting scenes and they are not very graphic at all. This could be a letdown for those who watch this movie hoping to see violence, blood, and gore. There isn't much of this, and the movie often drags along at a slower than usual pace for this type of movie.<br /><br />If this movie isn't about combat, then what exactly is it about? Well, it is basically a film about the utter boredom of war- the majority of the hours of each day when there is nothing going on and nothing to do. The viewer gets to observe the men as they look for ways to fill the time in each day. They talk about sex. They talk about politics. They talk about sex. They talk about their girlfriends or wives back home. And they talk about sex some more. Stuck in a combat zone with other men, the guys have to find some way to fill the hours of the day and this movie concentrates its efforts on this aspect of war: What goes on when there is no armed conflict taking place and the soldiers have to find ways to occupy their time.<br /><br />Parts of this movie move very slowly but these slow moments are sometimes interrupted with military action when the enemy draws near. These action scenes, however, don't come even close to the brutal, high- powered action scenes of other war movies. Director Sam Mendes wanted to keep the emphasis of Jarhead on the boredom, since this is what filled the bulk of the day for the men fighting in the Gulf War.<br /><br />Performances in this movie are generally very good, with Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Saarsgard leading the way. There is lots of abrasive language in this movie, and much of it is supplied by Jamie Foxx as he attempts to train and lead his troops. The rough language is the main reason this movie earned its "R" rating since the violent scenes are few.<br /><br />Jarhead has a large cast of characters, but you don't really get to know them on a personal level. The only person you really get to know is Anthony Swofford himself. You get to experience his feelings and thoughts through his own narration and through his own actions. But you don't get to know much at all about the other characters and this fact is one of Jarhead's strengths and weaknesses. It is a strength because it keeps the focus of the film on its core premise (the boredom of war and how soldiers deal with it) rather than on the personal lives of the characters themselves. But at the same time, this could be perceived by some viewers as a weakness because many of the characters seem very empty and underdeveloped. I didn't like this aspect of the film at first, but I accepted it more as the film dragged on.<br /><br />Because of the slowness of this movie and its scattered theme, it seems at times like a movie lacking direction. When I viewed it for the first time, I kept waiting for something to happen and I couldn't understand why Mendes didn't insert more action into some of the scenes. Like with the unknown characters, this is how Mendes intended Jarhead to be. No one person comes across as a hero; no vivid scenes of combat are shown; and no important political messages are shared. This is war at its dullest, but according to Swofford's book and the accounts of others who served in the Gulf War, this is pretty much the way it was.<br /><br />More than a movie about combat, Jarhead is a war movie about a man and his day to day experiences. This isn't a great war movie and I can think of many other war films that rank higher on my all time list. But it does offer an interesting perspective, showing how the endless hours with nothing to do can drive a soldier just as crazy as the time spent fighting the enemy.</p></body></html>

Here's what happens: a small town in rural Pennsylvania is beset by a mysterious illness that transforms good, normal cornfed Americans into mindless psychotic killers. Turns out it's a side effect of a secret government project gone wrong, and the Army is of course called in to clean up the mess. So this is in effect a three-sided horror film: the uninfected survivors have to contend with both their crazy-killer former neighbors and with a ruthless military operation which has issued kill-on-sight orders for all humans inside the quarantine area. Of course, this doesn't sit too well with the local sheriff (played by the charismatic Timothy Olyphant) or his loyal, capable deputy, who try to escape the worst of all possible situations.<br /><br />In some ways this stylish, methodical modern film can be seen as an adjunct to the original, and not simply a remake: the action is less concerned with the government's point of view -- less of the crazies attacking the soldiers, and more about the soldiers exterminating the locals. Olyphant is good, but mostly its the narrative that keeps this movie moving along at a fast clip. If you go for this sort of film, this is definitely worth checking out.

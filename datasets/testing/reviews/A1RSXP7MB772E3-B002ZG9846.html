It is alot more violent than I thought and it involved mobsters. Kick-ass lives up to its name when you're introduced to hit girl played by Chloe Moretz and Nicolas Cage as big daddy. The two are experts with all guns and explosives, and stabbing weapons. Big Daddy, or Damon Macready, trains his little daughter to be a killer with the ultimate goal of putting an end to mob king Frank D'amico played by Mark Strong. This includes some really ridiculous things like testing out bullet-proof vests on his daughter, and putting goals into her head like wanting deadly knifes instead of Barbie dolls. It caught me off guard, and never really was easy to watch.<br /><br />Hit girl does some troubling and sometimes outright wrong things in this movie. It looks like they have her swearing, and saying some adult things, although it could have been made to look this way but that doesn't make it right. The murder scenes are awesome, but deranged as they come from a little girl whose costume even has a plaid skirt. It really is strange how she behaves like a hardened, cool killer with an air of invincibility. It is a twisted tale of father and daughter with the intent on not fighting crime so much, but settling a vendetta.<br /><br />Kiss-ass is about Dave Lizewski, played by Aaron Johnson who looks like a young spider man. One day he orders a cape-less character suit and at first plays out comic book fantasies to himself. In ally's and on roof tops he prepares for the day when he will fight criminals. It becomes tragic, and real when he crosses young thugs and in trying to prevent a crime, kick-ass gets shanked and mauled by traffic. He survives with a new toughness. He can take a beating, and barely feels a thing. There is a realness and violence that makes these scenes serious, even though they are made light of later with jokes and funny situations.<br /><br />Instead of learning a lesson and growing up a bit, Dave sticks to his guns and once again helps out. He fights like rocky, taking serious blows that would knock the spirit out of anyone else, but he keeps fighting. It gets taped and put on YouTube by people who would rather watch than help, and Dave becomes an internet sensation. He loves the popularity gained, but this movie paints a serious world and soon Dave finds more trouble than he can handle.<br /><br />Kick-ass has some awesome music, which is a collaboration of many musicians. John Murphy is my personal favorite and the use a remix version of a song from 28 days later. There is more gun battles than straight out fist to face. There is a more serious danger to Kick-ass, that you wouldn't expect from a movie with teens and a girl that is around 11. It delivers in action and originality. It is shocking, and vulgar, and very unpredictable. I enjoyed this movie but thought some moments in this movie pushing the envelope. I do recommend this movie though, but it was not easy to do even though appropriately rated (R).</p></body></html>

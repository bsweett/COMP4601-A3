In retrospect, the massive mourning over Diana seems excessive and silly. The Queen's initial reaction of having a private funeral was the right choice but the crowds were insane - making much more of Diana than she deserved. In my opinion, the Queen was not out of touch - the British people were - so dazed by a foolish celebrity culture that they were no longer rational. Yes, Prince Philip comes off as stupid - most of the Royal family are. The Queen, however, has conducted herself with a great sense of duty and faithfulness to her people. Unfortunately, in the weeks after Diana's death, rationality and intelligence were difficult to come by. This movie is what many of us crave - an adult drama free of special effects and comupter generated aliens. The actor who plays Tony Blair does an equally excellent job.</p></body></html>

Running afoul of her strong discipline, they run and hide in a seemingly ordinary wardrobe in an abandoned room of the house, where younger sister Lucy claims to have discovered another world at the back of the closet. Literally stumbling into the land of Narnia, the four children become embroiled in a Civil War between the usurperous White Witch Jadis, and the rightful ruler of Narnia, Aslan the Lion.<br /><br />Firstly, the standard of acting in "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is what makes this movie so great. Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley and Anna Popplewell as Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan respectively, give great performances, with special nods to Henley and Keynes as two of the most promising child actors I've seen since Pamela Franklin in 'Jean Brodie'. Tilda Swinton as Jadis is absolutely wonderful: regal, detached and most definitely evil, kudos must also go to the casting director for actually hiring an Actress, and not one of the several million Jessica Biels that lurk out there.<br /><br />Direction is fitting: this is not a story where you skimp on showmanship, and Andrew Adamson has done a truly breathtaking job here. There's so little wrong with this visual treatment of Narnia that it's possible to get almost totally lost in the film. And in an age where CGI effects and technical frivolity are so often used to fluff up a pedestrian style of filmmaking, that's a real compliment.<br /><br />CGI effects here are the best I've seen to date. Forget Harry Potter, forget the Lord of the Rings trilogy, forget Episode III: "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is the current king of computer-generated plausibility. There were only two scenes where I felt "fake!! that's fake!", and those were (rather inexplicable) bluescreened backdrops. The creatures, the vistas, the spells, the battles... and Aslan the Lion is indescribable. You just have to see it to appreciate it.<br /><br />Production design is also magnificent. Narnia's various inhabitants are as varied as they are individual. From the mythic, like Giants, Hags and Naiads, to the real, like cheetahs, beavers and horses, the nonhuman inhabitants are memorable because of their sterling design. Jadis is incredible-looking, a sort of tribal queen with a real sense of power about her... and understated, considering what overstatement they could have come up with. And the countryside itself is magnificent: real and generated scenery blend here to create a backdrop that's wholly convincing, and very true to the spirit of the original book.<br /><br />Also, the movie's plot follows the novel closer than anything I've seen for a long time. Sure, there are changes, but for the most part, this huge fan of CS Lewis can tell you that they're not a big deal.<br /><br />My one quibble is with the script. Some of the dialogue feels too modern and a little too grown-up for the children. There's a glaring disparity between some of the comedy and the rest of the characterisation. The Witch and Susan seem to suffer the worst of these excesses, but worry not: it's mostly a convincing and standout screenplay.<br /><br />I can't recommend this highly enough. Easily the equal of the Harry Potters and Lord of the Rings, "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" deserves all the praise you can think of, and then some.<br /><br />Buy it now!</p></body></html>

And  with such a great story at the core of the film, it should have been used as the sequel to TOTAL  RECALL. Personally I would have liked to have seen  Arnie, or at the Very Least Paul Verhoeven, do this story in their  own way.<br /><br />Visually nice, and Tom Cruise do not a good film make.</p></body></html>

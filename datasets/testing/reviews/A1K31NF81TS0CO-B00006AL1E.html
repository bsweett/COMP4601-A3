I really love this set of movies and have fond memories of seeing all three of these movies on the bigscreen during my adolescent days.<br /><br />I really like how all three movies are tied together.  For all intents and purposes, this really is a 3 part Mini-Series, which just happen to be put out as three movies.<br /><br />It is one of the only movies I can remember which offered a "cliff-hanger" at the end of each film (parts 1 and 2).  Part one's cliff hanger being Doc returning from the future with bad news about Marty McFly's future kids, and part two's cliffhanger being the Western Union Message delivery service giving Marty the message from Doc, that he is still alive, in the pouring rain.<br /><br />Also, to the best of my knowledge, it is the only movie, which included "previews" for the next movie (part 3) at the end of the prior movie (part 2.)  When I saw this, I knew right away they had already filmed most of the 3rd in the series. I can't recall if they show this on the DVD. I'm pretty sure they don't, but they definitly showed it in the theater.<br /><br />I liked how Michael J. Fox (as well as the Biff character) played several parts, playing his grandfather, as well as his daughter, in part 2.  It certainly wasn't "Eddie Murphe" character acting genius, but it was good comedy relief, within the comedy.  Very funny.<br /><br />I would like to know why the girlfriend part was replaced by Elisabeth Shue.  While Elisabeth Shue does a much better job in the part, it was quite jarring to see this part replaced, and threw off the momentum of the movie ever so slightly.  They could have at least made her hair dark?  Other than that, no complaints.<br /><br />Another fact that I don't see mentioned very often, is that Crispin Glover did not appear in Parts 2 or 3, except for repeated film sequences from part 1.  Another actor played the part of Marty McFly's father in parts II and III.  Just another tidbit of trivia for you BTTF junkies.<br /><br />When I first saw this movie, I remember thinking: there was no American town such as that one.  No small town has a Malt Shop in the "downtown area" for example.  Well, I just recently moved to a small Northern California town, and it really reminds me of the town featured in this movie.<br /><br />MC White says: Check it out!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great mainstream film noir"></head><body><p>Proving to be much better than originally anticipated, L.A. Confidential was a hit with critics and managed to win Oscar's for Kim Basinger (Best Supporting Actress) and screenwriter Brian Helgeland.  Based on a series of James Ellroy's novels which takes place in 1940's Hollywood; L.A. Confidential manages to be one of the best mainstream film noirs in recent memory, and thanks to the brilliant directing by Curtis Hanson and the memorable ensemble cast (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, and Danny DeVito) helps make this film something truly special.  The DVD itself is one of Warner Bros.' better DVD packages; containing multiple parts of behind the scenes material that is actually worth watching.</p></body></html>

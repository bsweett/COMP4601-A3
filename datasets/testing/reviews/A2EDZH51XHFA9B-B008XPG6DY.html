In his native Sweden, he made Ondskan, which won worldwide acclaim. Hollywood imported him and, as Hollywood seems to do to so many of its imports, crippled him; the result of his first collaboration with the Hollywood regime is Derailed, a pale, derivative film that manages to take some of the best actors of its generation and utterly waste them.<br /><br />Clive Owen plays Charles Schine, a guy with a good job and a not-so-happy family-- his daughter suffers from a chronic illness. Still, he and his wife and daughter try to take things as they come. One day, he finds himself short of cash on the train, and is rescued by Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), a financial planner at a nearby banking firm. The two strike up a friendship that seems to want to progress into something more, despite their efforts to resist. They finally break down one night and head for a local fleabag hotel, where they're mugged by LaRoche (Vincent Cassel), a scruffy-looking guy who makes off with Schine's identification, using it to blackmail Schine.<br /><br />The plot should sound familiar, and it is; all the twists and turns here you've seen many, many times before. Both Owen and Cassel have done much, much better work in the past; Cassel is hopelessly adrift in this role, while Owen only manages to get his teeth into it on an intermittent basis. (Aniston, surprisingly, outshines them both.) But then, that may be less a fault of the actors than it is Stuart Beattie's anemic script; I don't know whether to place the blame for it being a second-rate David Mamet clone on Beattie or the James Siegel novel from which Beattie's script was adapted, but rest assured someone in the house is a big, big David Mamet fan. And, of course, you can't have a thriller these days without having a big, utterly predictable twist ending. Why I kept watching is entirely beyond me. * ?</p></body></html>

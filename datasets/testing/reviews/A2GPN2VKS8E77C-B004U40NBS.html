<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Psychological Drama. Natalie Portman Is Nothing Short Of Sheer Perfection Here."></head><body><p>Note: I saw this movie not less than 20 minutes ago with XFinity OnDemand.<br /><br />This film is nothing short of brilliant. Captivating from the opening shot until the end credits fade out, Darren Aronofsky's latest movie is a masterpiece, and may serve to boost interest in Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake, if not only for the beautiful music, than to see it performed live. Ms. Portman gives an electrifying performance. You feel as if you are drawn in, resisting the impulse to draw back because you find yourself wanting more...and you know you do. Ms. Portman is sheer perfection here. I highly recommend this movie based on Ms. Portman's performance. See this film, you will not regret it. Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13.</p></body></html>

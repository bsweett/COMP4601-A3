<meta name="summary" content="Plato in Plaid"></head><body><p>Admittedly, it takes about 15 minutes to get used to the wise-talking (and in this case I not only mean smart-mouthed but literally wise from intelligence) chatter of 16 year old Juno (Ellen Page, who looks like the love child of Jeannine Garafalo and Billy Cruddup) who finds herself pregnant. But whereas in most stories of this ilk, Juno is not without emotional resources: a wise, loving father and step mother (J.K. Simmons and the redoubtable Allison Janney) and a good friend...all three of whom are more than eager to offer advice. Juno attempts to have an abortion, can't do it and decides to give up her child for adoption. She scans the "Recycler" and finds a couple played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman who on several levels are less mature than Juno.<br />Director Jason Reitman (the terrific "Thank You for Smoking") and writer Diablo Cody are walking a slippery slope here: how do you make an unwed teenage mother with a smart mouth and a penchant for talking smack non-stop a la Holden Caulfield into someone who not only holds your attention but eventually steals your heart?<br />The Movies are peppered with a number of teenaged savants dating back many years with such notable examples as DeeDee (Christina Ricci in "The Opposite of Sex" to whom the moviemakers tip their hat as a precursor to Juno) and Harry Potter spouting profoundly about all manner of Life situations: in possession of learned and thoughtful opinions way, way beyond their years and life experience. Now we have Juno to add to that list.<br />"Juno" is at times very funny: not only in a ha ha sense but more importantly, cosmically and philosophically in a structured world view sense. A 16 year old without the common sense to use contraception yet intuitive and perceptive enough to wax poetically about Iggy Pop and Dario Argento? Yup: that's our Juno!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I like Borat....... He's nice"></head><body><p>You've heard about it, you've read about it, and by now you have probably seen it. Borat, the legendaery comedy movie starring our friend from Eastern Europe, has two purposes, to shock you and make you laugh your heiny off.<br /><br />In all seriousness, only a Jewish person could get away with a movie like this. If a non-Jew were to make these kinds of jokes, this film would have probably never seen the light of day. Much like a black stand-up comedian who has a license to say N****r, Borat can show an oversized female Jewish character laying an egg and then having children crush it. This is the kind of humor that politicians in America have to ignore. If anyone caught them laughing, they would be run out of town.<br /><br />I am not saying this film will be funny for everyone. Maybe not everyone likes to see a 300 pound, hairy and disgustingly obese man run around naked, getting bit on the teet, and having his massive bare buttocks slamming down on another man's face, but when you buy a ticket on the Borat Express, you got to stay on for the ride until the end.<br /><br />To me this film was refreshing. In a time when over-budget, A-list star movies leave you wanting more, Borat looks and feels much more like an independent film. I sincerely hope that one of the reasons this film was made was to strike Hollywood where it hurt. You can make a funny and entertaining movie without a billion dollars. I only wish Borat had a derogatory joke about Steven Spielburg, but insulting the most successful director of all time (and a fellow Jew), well maybe even Borat has his limits.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed every part of this movie. Some of my favorite scenes were the yard sale ("I come to collect your tears Gypsy"), the hotel room wrestling match ("How dare you make hand party with my Pam-eel"), and of course the village ("Dis is my sister, she is number 4 prostitute in all Khakistan"). I am not running for office and I have no need to be PC. This movie made me laugh out loud several times. From the driving lesson to the dinner on Secede Ave. From the rodeo to the gun store ("What is best gun to kill a Jew?"). This film is something I can watch again and again.<br /><br />The only thing I did not understand was the Pamela Anderson part. Right before he turned on Baywatch, a scene of Married with Children came on. Peg Bundy (Katey Sagal) was the sexiest woman to ever sashay across a TV screen. If I was Borat I would have wnet after her in a heartbeat. But then again, seeing Pamela Anderson being wrestled around and being put in a bag was as entertaining as the rest of the movie.</p></body></html>

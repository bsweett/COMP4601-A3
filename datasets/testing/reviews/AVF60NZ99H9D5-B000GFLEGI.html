<meta name="summary" content="was screenplay written by a zombie?"></head><body><p>George Romero is a pretty decent guy, no doubt about it, and as far as directors go he can be pretty damn good (just take a look at the original NOLD), but when it comes to screenwriting...man, forget it. The guy just can't cut it. He (badly) needs a real writer.<br /><br />First of all, this movie is a mess, and you got noone to give a hoot about, noone to relate to. Why? Poor writing. Mindless killing and things being blown up every few minutes just does not make for a compelling film--in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Also, this whole message thing is a bit tiresome as well. Look, George, we know you're a Lib and got the (dated) ponytail thing going, fine, but why do we have to have all this anti -Repulican stuff shoved our way?<br /><br />What you don't seem to realize is that quite a few of us don't trust either the Left or the Right. Get it? Both sides have an ax to grind and (therefore) are full of it. Most people go their OWN WAY--as I always have.<br /><br />Please, PLEASE--spare us the heavy-handed political claptrap--especially in a silly zombie flick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I said what if this movie was cool""></head><body><p>I, having seen the movie Get Shorty and having loved it, was excited about this movie. That was until I saw the lame previews. The Rock didn't look funny nor did Vince vaughn but I decided to give it a shot. I was right. It was a major letdown with some good laughs but the movie seemed boring, stupid, and just weird at times. The Rock playing a gay bodyguard wasn't funny, Vince Vaughn acting black wasn't funny, and the rest of the cast wasn't that good either. The movie has an all star cast with over 10 actors I'm very familiar with. That's weird but cool. But, it just wasn't funny. The plot is about Chili Palmer who leaves the Movie business for the Music business. He then finds a good prospect in a young singer. The movie has some good laughs but mostly nothing. If you want to laugh, watch get shorty and not this. Believe me, it's not funny.</p></body></html>

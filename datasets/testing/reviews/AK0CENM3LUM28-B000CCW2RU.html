And I don't mean that in a bad way - fun, mindless action is a valid and amusing way to spend a weekend evening. "The Island" is a step above many Michael Bay movies, though, in possessing a very thought-provoking philosophy underneath all the explosions and whizzing bullets.<br /><br />Not that the plot holes don't impinge heavily, of course. The clones being grown for extra parts are kept placid and calm with hypnotic suggestions that they want to go to the island, that they live to go to the island, that they don't need to think or question their surroundings. While the issue of "Why don't you just grow them in a vat?" is touched upon and discarded (the organs need stimulus in order to thrive), one wonders perhaps why they don't just give up this whole island scheme and just hypnotize the clones to want to serve as useful and happy organ donors. I can hear the objection of human survival instincts, but there have been plenty of death cults in the history of humanity and it seems like it wouldn't be too tricky to engineer one in this situation. Then you would have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345418921">The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</a> situation where you can cut right through the issue of "is it moral to eat meat?" by having a cow that actually *wants* to be eaten, and is capable of saying so to the expensive clients.<br /><br />But I digress, and really "The Island" is better as a metaphor for the current debate as to whether poor people should be allowed to sell their own organs in order to support their families. In this metaphor, "going to the island" would mean giving up your life to provide a better one for your family, and in this case the whole "but they are human, too!" rejoinder cuts just as harshly (if not more so) as with vat-grown clones.<br /><br />Realistically, though, any philosophy in "The Island" takes a firm back seat to the action. Male characters like fast things that go "vroom!" loudly, simply because they are male, and female characters are sweet and pretty and emotionally sensitive because that kind of stuff is handed out with the second X chromosome. But in true Michael Bay form, the excessive action is lavishly expensive action, and the special effects are spaced out with extremely good acting on the part of all the major actors. In light of all this, it's hard to get too nitpicky about the plot holes like the fact that memories are encoded into DNA and ancillary bad guys don't usually have major changes of heart at the last moment. View "The Island" for what it is - a pretty, if somewhat vacuous, destination that is worth a nice visit, even if you wouldn't want to live there.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

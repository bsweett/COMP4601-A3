<meta name="summary" content="All style and no substance makes for one pathetic excuse for a movie"></head><body><p>NOTE: This review contains a few spoilers<br /><br />I don't know where to begin, since there are so many things wrong in this movie. I'll start by saying what I DID like. There were some decent moments of music, and there were some nice-looking gadgets here and there. And.....that's it. The rest of Ultraviolet is pure trash from beginning to end. Here's why:<br /><br />-The CGI effects in this movie is appallingly bad. During about 90% percent of the time I was watching this movie, I was annoyed at how unrealistic the chase sequences, the buildings (both inside and outside), and the flying bullets looked. You can really tell when and where they used green screens and.<br /><br />-Every single character in this movie is never interesting and never intriguing. The kid character is a bore. The hemophage rebels are weak and completely forgettable. The main villain, a cardboard cutout at best, does not look dangerous in any way (one reason being a terrible casting choice). And finally, the hero named Violet is dull and unconvincing. Even when she feels conflicted, there is no real sense of dilemma that's conveyed onscreen. It seems more like a stupid excuse for plot progression.<br /><br />-Nearly everybody in the film does a horrid job at acting, especially Milla Jovovich as Violet & Sebastien Andrieu as Nerva. The sole exception is William Fichtner as Garth, who looks like he at least put some effort in his performance.<br /><br />-The dialogue is amazing, but in a very bad way. "You are all gonna die." I'm sorry, what?<br /><br />-Why are the colors in this movie so bright and disjointed? I think I'm having Batman & Robin flashbacks!<br /><br />-The fight sequences are some of the worst that I have ever seen. It's completely tedious, because the main character (Violet) doesn't get hit even once by a bullet nor a sword. She doesn't even get hurt when she crashes into a high-rise building with her motorcycle. There is no real sense of jeopardy, which really ruins any opportunity to create any suspense. In the end, once you've seen how she deals with literally dozens of soldiers, you'll know exactly how the end fight between the hero and the villain turns out.<br /><br />-There are several plot twists in this film, and NONE of them are shocking. Why? Because by this time, there is absolutely nothing in the story that fascinates me in any way.<br /><br />-One of the most overused and most notorious plot points is used in this movie. I just hate it when characters are brought back from the dead: it's getting old and useless.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie stinks. I couldn't really enjoy watching this mess. There are so many flaws in this movie that I lost count halfway through. It doesn't even pass as a guilty pleasure; that's how bad this movie is. Hard to believe that this cost about $30 Million to make. It should have been spent somewhere else.<br /><br />Grade: 2/10</p></body></html>

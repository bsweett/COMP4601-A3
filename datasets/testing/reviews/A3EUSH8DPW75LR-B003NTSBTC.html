I did not read the book on which it was based so I can't comment on its transfer to film but I can say that as an atmospheric, edge of your seat thriller this film is superb.  It is not perfect by any means.  The first time I watched it I was enthralled till the ending which sort of left me perplexed and made me unsure of the whole experience.  But this film is one where when they say it must be viewed twice they mean it.  Knowing the ending actually made a repeat viewing even better than the first.  I must note that after the first viewing I did enjoy it enough to purchase it.  I have now viewed it three times.  Of course we have two masters here - Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio.  In less talented hands than Scorsese this film could have turned into a regular B horror film.  But Scorsese treats the slightly flawed script with respect and the directing, music, photography, editing and most of all acting make this a grade A film all the way.  Leonardo DiCaprio is now proving film after film just what a skilled actor he is.  For me this was the best performance of his career and shows him to be one of the best actors of this deacade.  And perfect performances are elicited from Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley as well.  Actually this film was made with such precise decisions that even all the supporting roles down to the smallest ones are pitch perfect.  Of most note are Michelle Williams and Patricia Clarkson.<br /><br />The film begins with Leonardo DiCaprio as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels going with his new partner played by Ruffalo to Shutter Island which is an asylum for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a female inmate.  But no one is actually as they seem and truths about the island start to appear to Teddy and he realizes that things are sinister and there are many secrets here.  Then we get twists and turns galore that build to a very dramatic ending.  This is a film that must be viewed for it is cinema at its best.  We have the master director Scorsese turning an ok script into a suspense masterpiece.  From the beginning boat ride with the spooky atmospheric music you can sit back knowing you are going to have a super suspenseful ride.  Let the grade A directing and flawless acting bring you to another world.  I can't give this film 5 stars for the script is slightly flawed but I will view it over and over for the superb piece of film making it is.  And it makes a brilliant showing on blu ray.  The picture is very crisp and clarity superb.  Colors are brilliant and the whole experience will make you feel as if you are there.  Good film making still exists and here is a perfect example.</p></body></html>

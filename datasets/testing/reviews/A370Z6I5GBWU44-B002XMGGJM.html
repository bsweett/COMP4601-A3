The sad fact is that our justice system is not perfect, as evinced by this film - the guy that did the worst gets off with a short jail sentence and the guy who didn't actually kill anyone got a death sentence, but this is what happens when lawyers become more concerned with their records than actually serving justice. This should be a clear message to any lawyers watching the film - DO THE RIGHT THING OR THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN.<br /><br />At first, I was rooting for the Law-Abiding Citizen. The way he dealt with the man who violated and killed his wife and daughters.... bravo! I do wish the torture scene could have been more drawn-out. No, not the torture/cutting itself, but showing him at various stages through his slow death - legless, then armless, etc, begging for his life, the LAC talking to him scolding him, berating him. The movie would have benefited from that, because him doing that to his wife and daughter's murderers was justified.<br /><br />I laughed at the part where the daughter gets the DVD and watches it after her mom tells her not to. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR NOT LISTENING TO YOUR PARENTS, or even checking the address on the envelope. You should know better than to open mail that does not have your name on it, tsk tsk.<br /><br />I felt disappointed when he started going after innocent people, like the lawyer's assistant and the like, because at that point, I was no longer rooting for him. He just totally lost it, and the movie started to feel more unreal/unbelievable, at first I was prepared to give it 5 stars, then it dropped to a three, however, the ending was very good (in a thought-provoking sense), and brought the overall rating back to a 4. If you like thrillers, this is a good movie for you.</p></body></html>

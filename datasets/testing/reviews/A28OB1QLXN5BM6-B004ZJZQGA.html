<meta name="summary" content="Not a comedy. Not for me."></head><body><p>In Bruges was just not my cup of tea.  To be fair, I will say right up front that my husband loved it.  However, this movie did not appeal to me in the least.<br /><br />First of all, this film is in NO WAY a comedy, not even a dark comedy.  It is a very dark drama that has some admittedly funny moments.  But advertising it as a comedy misleads the audience.<br /><br />In Bruges details the odd morality and sense of right and wrong held by a group of hit men.  When one of the group accidentally kills a small child, the boss sends him and his partner to the lovely, historical city of Bruges for a two week cooling off.  The movie centers around the two hit men on vacation, and how they spend their time while waiting to hear from their boss.  When the bossed finally makes contact, you get the ending you expect from the beginning.<br /><br />My issues with In Bruges stem from the gratuitous, horrific violence of this film.  Yes, yes, it is about hit men, but I do not ever need to see a child being shot in the head.  It was completely unnecessary, and the information could have been conveyed in a number of different ways.  Clearly the director was going for shock value.  The movie was also full of drugs, stupid racist comments, and plenty of f-bombs.  While bad language does not normally offend me, I do prefer that it not be every other word.  Again, shock value.<br /><br />Overall, the acting in this film was very well done.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson both do an excellent job in their roles, and are thoroughly believable.  Their friendship is actually quite touching. Bruges itself is charming - a lovely backdrop for a film.<br /><br />In Bruges has been compared to Pulp Fiction.  However, I did not care for that film, either.  I want to be entertained when I watch movie, and I do feel this film could have been extremely entraining.  There IS a good story here.  It is just not carried out well, IMHO.</p></body></html>

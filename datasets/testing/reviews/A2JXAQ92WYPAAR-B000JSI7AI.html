For myself, the movie was visually pleasing and refreshing in some ways, too, but I had some problems with what is by now esteemed a virtual classic. I am a middle-aged guy, been around, lived in several states (though not Wyoming), but I have never seen a man cry, not once in my life. In this movie the guys are always crying. They cry when they meet, they cry when they separate, they cry after they kiss, they cry after they fight. Is this believable? In the film, it is 1963 and gay or not, I just don't believe they would have gotten through life intact crying all the time. Somewhere along the way, some male figure would have put them straight on this. They seem to have gotten the message on the shame of their sexuality, is it credible that they could have survived crying their way through high school, through military service, and so on? They would have had to learn the hard way that crying would not be tolerated. This seems like a small point, but for me it is indicative of the overall anachronistic mode of the film, which looks and feels a lot like two 1980s Santa Monica gays time traveling back in the 1960s. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think they wouldn't have survived a junior high school gym class weeping and slobbering they way they do.</p></body></html>

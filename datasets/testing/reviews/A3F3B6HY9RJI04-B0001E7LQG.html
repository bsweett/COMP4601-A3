<meta name="summary" content="Really enjoyed!"></head><body><p>I took my wife to this movie since it was her turn to pick one out (I was all up for seeing Lord of the Rings AGAIN!!).  I brought my Palm Pilot to keep me awake through this as I'm not big fan of romances, not even romantic comedies.<p>Well, the Palm Pilot never came out.  This was truly a wonderful movie to see.  It was funny.  The three stars are Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, and (surprisingly) Keanu Reeves.<p>Jack Nicholson plays an old man hot on the trail of younger women.  He meets Diane Keaton, his young girlfriend's mother, and develops a (somewhat strained) relationship after having a heart attack and being forced to recuperate at her house.  Keanu Reeves plays the Doctor (when he walked in I said, "Oh, no!!  Not Keanu Reeves playing a DOCTOR!!!!") that helps Jack recover, but also develops a love interest in Diane Keaton as well.  Okay, I'm not what you would call "a Keanu Reeves fan"... but he actually did a great job in this movie... except the parts he was playing a doctor.<p>Highly recommended.  Prepare to be entertained and have you laughing from start to finish.</p></body></html>

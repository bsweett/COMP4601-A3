<meta name="summary" content="Double indemnity"></head><body><p>Mr. Brooks is a delightful movie, spiced of black humor about a very respectable personality, labeled as "The man of the year" who has a dark behavior. A lovable wife, a peaceful life, a beautiful daughter but in last instance a boring life who induces him to find in the murder an exciting motive to live, eluding the multiple rules that govern him here and there.<br /><br />His alter ego, William Hurt is his hidden mind, his dark side of the moon as so speak. In many ways this film keeps a narrow resemblance with an overlooked cult movie of the past decade "Fight club" . The main difference is that this one works at four levels. Mr. Brooks, the female detective, Mr. Smith and finally his own daughter and these four stories are solidly developed to bring us an attractive script with many riddles to solve.<br /><br />Watch it. It's rewarding.</p></body></html>

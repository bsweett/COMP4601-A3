<meta name="summary" content="Better than The Da Vinci Code, but not much more than a chase movie"></head><body><p>I confess:  I fell asleep -- twice -- while trying to watch the Da Vince Code, so I wasn't exactly anxious to see this movie; however, Angels and Demons kept my attention from start to finish.  Although it wasn't great cinema, at least I didn't have to listen to Tom Hanks talk in rapid fire exposition just to get to the next scene.  Instead of offering intellectual treatise on centuries of conspiracy, Angels and Demons is more physical, more visceral, with the fear of mass destruction taking the front seat to the finer details of the Illuminati.  The film is more or less a series of chase scenes, with Robert Langdon (Hanks) teaming up with physicist Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer) to stop the imminent murders of four cardinals as the other cardinals meet to elect a new pope.  The kidnapper has a dangerous capsule filled with anti-matter stolen from Vittoria's lab at the Cern Accelerator, and its detonation could destroy all of Vatican City and a good portion of Rome.  Add tension between the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) and Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who presides over the conclave, and the plot gets just enough complexity to add a twist or two.  The only aspect that is truly annoying is the time-line:  the characters have only an hour to identify and get to each location, yet they seem to take their time until the last minute.  And there's no way that everything that happens could do so within the amount of time described.  Just suspend your disbelief, and go along for the ride.<br /><br />The conspiracy theory in Angels and Demons is less intricate than that of The Da Vinci Code and thus makes for better cinema.  The simpler plot allows for one chase scene, one murder, one explosion/fire after another.  For this reason, it is an exciting action film without offering much to consider in retrospect.  It is decent entertainment, but not much else, making it a good choice when you want your adrenalin to course and your brain to coast.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></body></html>

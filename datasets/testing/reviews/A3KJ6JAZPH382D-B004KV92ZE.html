You're given the standard boiler-plate unlikely hero makes good plot, with Jack Black as Po the Panda and Dustin Hoffman as his not-so-willing coach, Master Shifu. The "Furious Five" are all super-jocks that think this oafish bear doesn't belong in their rarefied air, but Po eventually wins them over with pluck, wit and courage. The evil villain Tai Lung (voiced superbly by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OTU">Deadwood's Ian MacShane</a>) comes back to get revenge on past indiscretions; can Po save his beloved valley and prove that he was correctly chosen the Dragon Warrior?<br /><br />That's the plot in a nutshell, and if you think you've seen this a million times before, you're right. Both live action (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800177258">A League of Their Own</a>) and animation (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVKGQC">The Shrek Trilogy</a>) have covered this ground, and "Kung Fu Panda" walks the same turf like it was rice-paper. What sets it apart are the clever nods to old-school Kung-Fu flicks (along with having Jackie Chan add his voice skills) and its ability to resist over-indulgence in easy humor. Only once or twice does the film resort to butt or burp/fart jokes.<br /><br />That helps hold the film's IQ higher than much of "Family Film" content, so I feel safe bumping "Kung Fu Panda" to a fourth star. The dialog is also clever and snappy, which leaves Jack Black plenty of room to riff and vocally mug. (Something the clumsy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNQS">Robots</a> couldn't overcome, even with Robin Williams leading the voice cast.) The animation is super, giving each character his or her own special trait; I especially loved the burning eyes of Tigress. The battle scenes were exciting, too. With such a positive message in the midst of it all, "Kung Fu Panda" was second only to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FSL3E">Wall-E</a> as the summer's best animated movie.</p></body></html>

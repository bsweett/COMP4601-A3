A mystery/odyssey which looks uncompromisingly yet respectfully at a subculture filled with despair and danger where even the closest relationships involve caution and suspicion with great care taken to never give up an advantage or reveal anything which could ever possibly be used against you. One of the most genuinely human films I have seen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The perverted lives (and lies) of four miserable human beings"></head><body><p>On the back of the Closer DVD jacket, there's a quote from Time saying "at last, a love story for adults."  Obviously, Time watched the wrong movie because if there is one thing this movie is definitely not about, it's love.  These four characters are among the most amoral, dysfunctional human beings (and I use the term lightly) I've ever encountered.  The sad thing is that there are probably some people out there who act just like them.  This is a truly uncomfortable film to watch; it's crude, lewd, and dripping with misery from start to finish.  And the director, not satisfied at merely making you ashamed to be a human being, throws in a bonus in the form of something I found completely inexplicable at the very end.<br /><br />I don't know why Jude Law keeps playing pitiful losers, but he's certainly quite good at it.  The character of Dan comes right from the very bottom of the barrel.  He's a would-be novelist who seemingly falls crazy in love with Alice (Natalie Portman) after his very presence makes her walk out in front of a moving car.  Ah, this is Fate doing its thing, you think - until he puts the moves on Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer he has just met.  Anna rebuffs his advances - sort of, and Dan gets back at her by playing a moronic (not to mention filthy) joke, which, strangely enough, brings a perverted dermatologist named Larry (Clive Owen) into her life.  Dan still lusts after Anna, even after she's married Owen, and eventually Anna and Dan fall in mutual lust and break up both couples.  This is not to say that Alice and Owen are innocent, as they engage in all kinds of perversions of their own.  To its credit, the movie doesn't exactly let everyone live happily ever after - which is good because none of these characters deserves one moment of happiness.<br /><br />The film is somewhat strange in that major shifts in the relationships take place off-screen; we're going along one path, and then all of a sudden we're told that we've actually been going the other direction for months and months.  The interrelationships of these four people shift more often than the plates around the San Andreas Fault - with most of the action taking place beneath the surface.  The results are emotional earthquakes that leave everything dirty and unsettled, with no solid ground upon which to build anew.  The emotional wreckage of these people's lives is not a pretty sight by any stretch of the imagination.  The acting in the film is top-notch, but the story makes Closer quite a miserable, disturbing thing to watch.</p></body></html>

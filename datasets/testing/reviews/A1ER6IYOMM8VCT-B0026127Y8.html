<meta name="summary" content="FAST PACED GUILTY PLEASURE FUN!"></head><body><p>'Taken' is a fast paced action film that doesn't waste anytime getting to the point. The set up is simple and Liam Neeson shows he can play a bad A$$ as good as the next guy. What I enjoyed about this film is that it doesn't try to be something it's not. It's under an hour and a half and Neeson is terrific as a father on a mission to save his teenage daughter. If your an action fan this is a no brainer, but I think this will satisfy any movie lover who likes guilty pleasure films.</p></body></html>

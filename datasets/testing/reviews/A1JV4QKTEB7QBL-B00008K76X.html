<meta name="summary" content="Likeable Thriller"></head><body><p>In this film adapatation of the bestselling novel,Clancy's intrepid uberhero Jack Ryan has transmuted from Harrison Ford's sure-footed adept major player to Ben Affleck's waiting-to-get-his-big-break junior man.  Strange?  Only when judging the film with the novel and the author's entire body of work involving Jack Ryan.  Having not read the novel, this obvious discrepancy did not play a part in my judgement of the film or its performances.<br />On the whole, the film is good; the premise believable, all the more chilling in the wake of 9-11.  Affleck is on the brink of being 'discovered' by the CIA higher-ups; his paper on the new Russian president moves him into an inner circle of quick decision-making presidential advisers headed by the wonderful Morgan Freeman.  Not knowing the protocol, Ryan speaks when he is not spoken to, is judged green, shut down by the brass and goes through many agonizing moments of frustration when he is not even given the chance to express his theories.<br />In the end, he is proven correct, but not before monumentally catastrophic disaster strikes in scenes all too reminiscient of 9-11.<br />Affleck is amicable enough as Ryan; I would have liked to see how Harrison Ford's more mature Ryan would have changed the plot and the interchange with other characters.  Of course, Morgan Freeman is fantastic (as he always is) in his role as senior advisor.<br />Recommended to all who like a fast-paced thriller that all works out well in the end.</p></body></html>

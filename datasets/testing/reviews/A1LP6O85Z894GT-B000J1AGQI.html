<meta name="summary" content="A very very good film"></head><body><p>Perhaps the contemporary war film is becoming a tired and near exhausted genre in its current form. After the watershed "Saving Private Ryan", there really may not be much new to say in a large scale war epic.<p>One might certainly gain this impression based upon the many negative reviews of both "Ryan" and this film. Those souls have attempted to brand these two films as cliched and retro-patriotically simplistic. Watching this film as well as listening to director/writer Randall Wallace's superb audio commentary, it becomes apparent that "Ryan" and "We Were Soldiers" can possibly be labeled as cliched because they are both honest and realistic.  We find an example of this in the dialouge uttered by the dying soldiers who often proclaim "Tell my wife I love her." Yes we have heard this time and time again, but that just happens to be frequently what soldiers say in their final moments. Unfortunately when we see the same truth shown too many times, it does become often cliched and redundant. <p>But what else does one want in an honest war film? Perhaps some folks deride this and "Ryan" in favor of the pretentious new agey pseudo Steinbeck-lite ramblings of Terrence Malick's beautifully photographed but muddled, cold and pompous piece of snobbish fluff that was "The Thin Red Line".<p>But I digress, "We Were Soldiers", missing becoming a classic because of its unfortunate timing in coming after "Ryan" still remains a very very good film.<p>I particulary appreciated Wallace's inclusion of footage that raises the humanity and the courage of the NVA regulars. These are not Hollywood stereotyped villians. These soldiers are equally as brave, pious and devoted as the American soldiers. Wallace achieves this balance without resorting to any political posturing. This becomes especially apparent in many scenes, including a remarkably touching quiet scene in which Gibson's (delivering a fine performance) Hal Moore aknowledges the fact that the enemy prays to Diety as well.<p>I also value this film's structure. "We Were Soldiers" shows the homefront as equally as the battlefield. It shows the pre war experience as well as the war and the post war time as well. Wallace, utilizing the real veterans of this battle, seeks to humanize the reality of the war. Again, some might find much of these sequences quaint and simplistic. But they remain true. <p>This film also avoids the cynical, nihilistic and ugly previous portaits of Vietnam soldiers that bombarded us in the '70's, '80's and early '90's. It seemed that the films of DePalma, Stone (except for his excellent "Born On The Forth Of July"- which might be his most balanced film) sought to tear apart and demonize America through the Vietnam soldier. This film seeks again to give them some dignity and honor and finds it in their devotion to their fellow men (and honor of enemy!).<p>What makes "We Were Soldiers" a must own as opposed to a simply must see, is Paramount's (usually incredibly stingy in their packaging) inclusion of a great many extras. As stated earlier, Wallace's commentary is most illuminative. Many of the deleted scenes flesh out the emotional and intellectual impact of the film and are worth watching as well.<p>Give this film a try. It is definately a film that honors the veterans of the war. From both sides of the battlefield.</p></body></html>

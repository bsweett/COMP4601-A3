Like Tashlin, Besson is a canny businessman, able to play the marketing/financing game to ensure big budgets and big stars which he utilises for parodic and ironic purposes.  He's lucky that Bruce Willis is game, merrily sending up his perspiring 'Die Hard' action he-man image, his trademark singlet turned orange to match the heroine's carrotty hair.  As well as the pumping grind of Willis' films, Besson litters 'The Fifth Element' with allusions to the likes of 'Star Wars', 'Close Encounters' and 'Star Trek', over-egging their adolescent fantasy, revealing their modes to be the highest camp, a big-budget inflation of a Village People video, maybe one directed by Sergio Leone.  And onlookers were surprised the film didn't go down well in America?!<p>'Element' is a comic flipside to 'Blade Runner''s dour post-modernism, with the emphasis firmly on gender.  The hero is a mixture of action man (ex-military hero) and Everyman (cab driver) with requisite 'personal' problems (his wife left him).  These cliches are roundly mocked, backstory is rendered absurd, and in a classic running joke, Willis is the victim of a hectoring mother constantly on the phone.  The heroine is a replicant created, in mock-Biblical/'Bride of Frankenstein' style, from the DNA of a severed limb (Dr. Freud!).  Her attempts to learn English reveal the film's self-consciousness about its status as a French product trying to infiltrate the American market [the heavy, ambiguous presence of corporate product placement]: she attempts to understand words through pictures (for instance, 'war' is explained in a hysterical 'Clockwork Orange'-type montage): the cinema as post-literate lingua franca?  <p>Everything in the film is purloined from US action and sci-fi movies, from the fuzzy mystical premise of the fifth element to the action narrative sublimating a deferred love story, to the high-voltage high-body-count action set-pieces.  But whereas American movies seek to affirm cliched images of gender - heroic masculinity, dependent femininity - 'Element' wreaks havoc on them, mixing genders, races and species with joyous abandon, and putting them through a camp blender in which costumes, make-up, dialogue, art-direction, music, performance, action choreography, motivation, editing and camerawork smash mainstream ideological certainties and functions.  I never thought I'd say this about a Luc Besson movie, but 'Element' is enormous fun, right down to its wicked parody of former 'cinema du look' cohort Jean-Jacques Beineix's 'Diva'.</p></body></html>

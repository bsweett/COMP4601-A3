<meta name="summary" content="Smart, intense film...and Clooney's best performance."></head><body><p>In the past, George Clooney has been, to me, more of a charming movie-star than a real "actor."  His best performances were when he turned on the charm and the smile, such as in OUT OF SIGHT, OCEANS 11 or O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?  He excels at being a likeable cad.  In more "serious" roles, such as in THREE KINGS, he was helped by the sheer energy and excellence of the film itself.  To me, his Oscar win in SYRIANA was more of a nod to his political stances and to his willingness to endure weight-gain and brutal back pain.  But finally, in MICHAEL CLAYTON, he delivers a true dramatic performance, with depth of character and a willingness to put aside his natural charm WITHOUT having to gain weight or grow a beard.  He's the George Clooney we all recognize...but he's weighed down be guilt, lack of sleep and just a general sense of world-weariness.  He's feeling Weltschmertz!!  His clothes are all shades of gray, his hair and even his eyes (and the bags under them).  There is no color in this man's life.  So Clooney's costumer has designed this external look for him...but Clooney manages to internalize it as well.<br /><br />He plays a "fixer" for a HUGE law firm.  He gets clients out of legal jams, and operates on the fringes of the firm.  He's almost like their in-house private eye with a law degree.  He doesn't really get to practice law...he just has lots and lots of important contacts.  In the movie, he has been assigned to escort an attorney from the firm back to safety after said attorney (played by the always interesting and hugely underrated Tom  Wilkinson) goes a little crazy during a deposition.  Essentially, Wilkinson has succumbed to guilt over his role in a years-long defense of a chemical company that has probably poisoned hundreds of people with one of its products.  Unfortunately, his realization has also made him careless and manic (he's off his meds)...and thus he has become VERY dangerous to the case.<br /><br />Sydney Pollack plays a senior partner in the firm and Tilda Swinton plays the head in-house council for the big conglomerate.  Both of them maneuver and politic like old pros (none more smoothly and effectively than the perfectly cast Pollack)...and Swinton just may find she is in over her head...and may have to resort to measures that aren't exactly legal to protect her company.  Clooney is sucked in to all this mess.  At first, he doesn't care too much about the case (he's got some serious financial problems weighing him down)...but as things progress, he begins to see how he's being manipulated, and how the case itself has been manipulated.<br /><br />The trailers for the film don't make it look very action-packed...but all I can say is that it is LESS action-packed than that.  This is a talky film.  Lots of intense, sweaty, fraught conversations.  But it is well-written and directed by Tony Gilroy, who makes the verbal gymnastics and subtle plot turns quite riveting.  I believe that anyone aged about 21 or under would be bored silly by the film...it REQUIRES careful attention...but it also rewards that careful attention.  It is a film that deals in grays, not in black and white.  (Even though we know pretty easily who the bad guys are...that isn't the point...it's the journey of Michael Clayton that is gray.)  You dare not even take a bathroom break watching this film...each little scene advances either the plot or the characters in critical ways.<br /><br />I must also say that mid-way through the film, a murder is committed that is about as creepy and bluntly realistic as any murder in a thriller could be.  It is the opposite of showy...it's quick, grimy, heartless and believable.  It was a scene that sucked the breath out of the audience.<br /><br />On the other hand, the only serious flaw in the film was an ending that was a bit to pat and "Hollywood-ish."  The final few minutes are richly satisfying on a gut level...but when you step back just a bit, they really don't ring entirely true.<br /><br />But that is a minor flaw.  I give the film 4.5 stars, and will round up to 5.  And this is from a guy who REALLY dislikes the "real-life" George Clooney and his simple-minded politics.  But I've got to give him his due here...it's a very good performance.  (Stick around for the long closing credits sequence.  Clooney actually does his best work in what must have been an extremely tricky bit...and is completely silent.)</p></body></html>

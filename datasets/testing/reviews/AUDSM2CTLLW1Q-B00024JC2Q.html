Prior to the full feature motion picture coming out, I had come across only two passing references to this show (other than having the knowledge that it had existed at one time).  The first was when the main character in the 80's kids film "Flight of Navigator" asked if this show was still on TV because it was his favorite.  The other reference came while watching British comedian, Benny Hill's "One Night Video Stand" when he did a hilarious send-up of "Starsky & Hutch" and the spate of atrocious 70's television production values.  So, what is there to entice someone like me to see this film?  The answers are obvious:  The opportunity to see the modern-day odd couple of Ben Stiller (Starsky) and Owen Wilson (Hutch) expertly ply their comedic trade as the title characters and to see Snoop Dogg in his first feature length mainstream role as ubiquitous Huggy Bear.<br /><br />There are few actors more laid back than Owen Wilson, and there are few actors more neurotic and `tick-ish' than Ben Stiller, which makes their castings a stroke of inspiration.  Stiller's Starsky is an anal, by the books martinet, while Wilson's Hutch is a laid back `dude' with more than a few shady shenanigans going on behind the scenes.  So, naturally, events will conspire to force Starsky & Hutch to partner up to fight Bay City's latest bad guy, sleazy drug dealer Reese Feldman (played with the sleaziness expert, Vince Vaughn).  It seems Feldman likes to deal in cocaine and now seems to have come up with a variety that is undetectable to police dogs, making it truly a hot commodity.  Acting on a tip for `information broker' (don't dare call him a snitch) Huggy Bear, the boys begin an investigation to stop Feldman in his tracks.  Of course, this being a comedy, instead of serious remake of the original show, all hell breaks loose and Starsky & Hutch more than have their hands full trying to stop Feldman.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is, "Starsky & Hutch" should be funnier than it actually is.  It is full of hilarious moments, but those moments never seem to create moment that make the film an overall laugh riot.  It's possible that the ease at which Wilson and Stiller fit into their roles is more of a detriment because it seems like they aren't trying very hard (when the likely just make it look that way).  The plot, when stripped down, reveals itself to be paper-thin, as well.  On the other hand, it's those numerous hilarious moments that do rescue this film.  Will Ferrell makes an amusing cameo and a prisoner who will offer key information for a few `special favors' from the guys.  Snoop's brief scenes are eminently watchable (such as the golf course scene) and show that this guy has a future in film other than directing "Girls Gone Wild" videos.  Then there is always the manic Ben Stiller who has far too many scenes to count where he simply flips and leaves the audience in stitches.<br /><br />On the whole, "Starsky & Hutch" is not likely to occupy your thoughts beyond five minutes past the closing credits.  Yet, it makes for a fun 100 minutes and is a good way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  After all, that's what this type of movie is meant for.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Day the Audience Fell Asleep"></head><body><p>This is quite possibly the most disappointing movie I've ever seen.  So much potential, so little effort.<br /><br />What was abundantly clear was that the script was unfinished when they started shooting the film and they never managed to come up with any good story ideas to pad out the running time.<br /><br />Jaden Smith serves no purpose in the film except to prompt audience members to shout "Will somebody please get that kid off the screen!"<br /><br />Skip this movie.  In fact, don't just skip it -- run quickly away from it.<br /><br />They should have released this film on Thanksgiving Day for those who wanted a healthy dose of a big turkey.</p></body></html>

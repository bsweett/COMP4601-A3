It's just great from the very first scene to the last one.The only thing you can say to yourself as the end credits roll is "wow, thats' what great filmmaking and acting is all about". Such is the case with Director, Sidney Lumet's powerhouse of a melodrama, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead".<br /><br />In this film we are introduced to two adult brothers, Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawke). Both men are extremely different people, who lead very different life styles. But besides DNA, they do share one thing in common...money problems. At the start of the film, Andy pitches Hank an unusual ideal. He proposes, that they rob their own, elderly parents' small, suburban jewelry store. Andy assuredly presents this as a golden opportunity to solve their individual financial problems. An easy, victimless crime, that in the end will be covered by the insurance company. Hank is less sure, debating and arguing both the moral and practical implications of committing such an act. This sounds like a really bad, crack-pot ideal...right? You betcha. In the course of the actual robbery, everything that could go wrong, does go wrong with horrendous results.<br /><br />But this is all just a jumping off point for the story. In a non-linear, "Pulp Fiction"-like fashion, we are slowly presented with both the events, that lead up to the robbery and the aftermath, in which both brothers are desperately trying to cover up their crime. The dominoing  consequences end up tragically, devastating everyone involved and leads to the revelation of long buried, emotional family problems and dysfunction.<br /><br />Director, Sidney Lumet, who's long and storied career includes many cinematic classics ("12 Angry men", "Dog Day Afternoon", "The Verdict", "Network") has made a truely great film. Maby, I'm committing a form of 'ageism', but I'm just amazed that a director, who's in his eighties is producing work, that has so much creativity, energy and vitality to it. My hat is off to him. Sidney Lumet is truely a consumate film artist.<br /><br />The same can be said for the film's cast, which includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei. These four actors give just all around fantastic performances, that are at the top of their craft. In particular, I am quite impressed with Hoffman's turn as Andy. At first he presents us with a man, who seems composed, placid and assured in what he is doing. But as things start to fall apart, we watch this character just slowly implode into a mess of insecurities and dysfunction. Philip Seymour Hoffman may have won the Academy Award for "Capote", but this has to be one of his best performances ever.<br /><br />The DVD features an interesting, short documentary on Sidney Lumet and the making of this film. Also included is a commentary track featuring Lumet, Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman. If your a fan of crime thrillers, good drama or just great filmmaking in general, then check out "Before the Devil Knows Your Dead". Excellent movie! Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

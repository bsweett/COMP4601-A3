<meta name="summary" content="From London With Lots of Love"></head><body><p>Love Actually is a feel good movie..in fact is a feel very good movie, one that is superbly written, but then it is not surprising coming from Richard Curtis, a man who has forever changed British Comedy back in 1979 with Not The Nine O'Clock News launching as a result the careers of Britain's most loved comedians, like Rowan Atkinson, Mel Smith, and Griff Rhys Jones.<br />Curtis also co wrote with Ben Elton the classic Blackadder and showed an early talent and understanding of a highly sophisticated,satirical,intelligent as well as hilarious type of comedy. His venture into movie writing was as successful, and Four Weddings and A Funeral and Notting Hill are now considered as classics.<br />What is surprising though is Curtis's abilities as a director. He has managed to tell his own script with such ease, sympathy, and simplicity, and to direct more than twenty main characters, each to a varying degrees with a three dimensional and deep personalities.<br />Love Actually is actually a film that combines some very funny scenes with a lot of poignancy...It is all about love as we know or experience it.Love that crosses language barriers, love that means sacrifice, love that is dedication, love that can be an instant infatuation, love that means forgiveness, love that means fantasy, love that means to just be there, love as in hope, in short love as in life..There are ten stories of different kinds of love that occasionally cross paths, colorful canvases of different people, and different relationships, and different loves.<br />The casting could not have been better, from Liam Neeson, Laura Linney (one of the best American and most underrated actresses),Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman,Martine McCutcheon, Bill Nighy and two of Curtis's personal friends from the old days, Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant.There are also plenty of very well cast cameos, from Billy Bob Thorton as the American President, Rowan Atkinson as a salesman (although he is billed as one of the main stars, his role is actually very small),Sienna Guillory, Claudia Schiffer, to January Jones and Denise Richards.<br />The most hilarious dialogues and scenes come courtesy of Grant as the prime minister!! You should just hear what he says talking to the painting of Mrs Thatcher!! But every one contributes equally to make you laugh, smile, and reflect..<br />The film starts and ends at Heathrow, with the images of people greeting, hugging and kissing each other and a very touching narrative tells us about how the message of the plane passengers of the 9/11 tragedy in their final calls was about love and forgiveness and not hate and revenge. It is ultimately the message of Curtis himself, and throughout the film until  the end you realize just how significant and true this message is.<br />Love Actually is a MUST SEE movie that is totally endearing, one that will make you feel so good about love and life!<br />DO NOT MISS!</p></body></html>

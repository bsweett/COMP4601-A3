Denzel Washington was great, as always, and so was Gary Olman, but the story line was a wee bit slow at times and kind of lacking a punch.  It was a little gory, too (at least for me, anyway--not really my kind of movie).<br /><br />The story begins with fallen ash and dead bodies everywhere.  There has been a massive war that has left many dead and the land stripped.  It has become survival of the fittest for the most part.  Gangs are worse than wild animals and often ambush folks and take whatever they can to survive. Water and food are hard to find.  Some people even resort to eating human meat, and they are the ones with shaky hands.  The basic scene is very similar to Mel Gibson's "Mad Max" movie from the 1970s (?).<br /><br />Denzel (Eli) is our hero.  He walks the land in peace, trying to survive, but he can also defend himself when others try to mess with him.  He is unbelievably quick with a knife, gun, or arrow and when he must kill, he prays over the bodies.  He carries a book with him and is on a mission from God to take the book to the West Coast.  The book is the King James Bible.  After the war, all other remaining copies of the book were destroyed.<br /><br />Gary Olman is a power hungry bad guy who is searching for the same book, because it is said to give power to its owner and he wants to create a kingdom for himself out of what's left.  Gary gets a bit overly enthusiastic when he finds out that Eli has that book and the struggle begins.<br /><br />As I said, it's good but not great, although both actors do an excellent job in their roles.  Would I watch it again?  No!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Man of Irony"></head><body><p>Morton Downy Jr. plays the lead in a film that transcends the comic genre. He portrays Tony Stark; the creator of Iron Man.  Tony inherited the legacy of his father's company; a weapons manufacturer.  All the core elements of the comic are there. Jarvis is a computer in this one.  Happy Hogan, the chauffeur.  Gweneth Paltrow was extraordinary as Pepper Potts; IM's executive assistant.  Gweneth added dimension to what could have been a throwaway part.  Being his close confidant, she was privy to the issues that needed his attention.  The details of the original were all there.<br /><br />Over forty years of continuity of didn't bog down this story.  Unlike Hulk, Spidey and X-Men, Iron man wasn't one of the more popular characters.  Being true to form, following the comics "Demon in a Bottle" tale, Tony has a drinking problem.  However, the movie deals with that aspect without turning the character into a joke.<br />Fans of S. H. I. E. L. D.  take note.  There's a surprise in store for you if you watch the end of the credits.</p></body></html>

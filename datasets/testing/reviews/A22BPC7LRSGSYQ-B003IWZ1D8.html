It certainly is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Everything about this movie was done so well - the suspense, the musical score, the wise use of black-and-white instead of color, the acting, the scariness, everything.<br /><br />The movies stars Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, John McIntire, and Janet Leigh.<br /><br />Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) has stolen $40,000 from her employer.  At one point after driving all night she pulls over on the side of the road to catch some zzzzzz's, and when the cop wakes her up the next day, she says she's in a hurry to go.  Well, she wasn't in a hurry before the cop woke her up.  I know she's just saying to the cop that she's in a hurry in order to get away from him because of her guilt over stealing the money and her desire to keep hiding it, but this scene is kind of funny.  After driving all night again, this time in the rain, she stops at a motel for some rest.  The motel is run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).  His house is a short distance away from the motel.  She says to Bates that she's hungry.  Bates says he can bring her some food, and that he was just about to eat himself.  He brings the food, then she says that she really doesn't have an appetite.  Then she says to Bates that as long as he brought the food, they may as well eat it.  They go into the office to eat, but suddenly Bates isn't hungry.  I get a kick out of this.<br /><br />That's all I'm going to say.  I don't want to give away what happens.  Read other reviews if you want to find out everything that goes on in this movie.  The now infamous "shower scene" is classic, but I think the best part of the movie is when private detective Milton Arbogast (played by Martin Balsam) is questioning Norman Bates at the front desk.  The overall performance of Anthony Perkins throughout the movie is great.  He carries this movie.  Martin Balsam is also great as Milton Arbogast.  Vera Miles and John Gavin give great performances as well.  The overall atmosphere in general is one of the strong points.  The rain, the night sky, the swamp, the motel, the house........it looks like a haunted house.  In my opinion, the second half of the movie is just as strong as the first half, if not stronger.<br /><br />Some of the extras on this DVD include The Making Of Psycho documentary, a censored scene, theatrical trailers, production drawings, the shower scene with and without the music, newsreel footage, and photos from when the movie was being shot.<br /><br />If you want to watch a horror masterpiece by Hitchcock, then this is your movie.  Very highly recommended.</p></body></html>

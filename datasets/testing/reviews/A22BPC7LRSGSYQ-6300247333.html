I said, "I've never seen that movie."  He said, "Yes you have.  I brought it over that one time."  I said, "When?"  He said, "Like maybe two years ago."  I still didn't remember it.  Then he began to describe it more.  Then I suddenly vaguely remembered the movie.  I said, "Oh yeah...I think I remember now.  That was like in February 2009 when you brought that over.  Yeah, I didn't like that movie.  That's why I forgot all about it.  It's a forgettable movie.  It didn't stick with me."<br /><br />The above paragraph sums up my feelings about this movie.  It was so lousy, boring, and not scary that I ended up forgetting that I even saw it.  I wouldn't recommend wasting your time seeing it.</p></body></html>

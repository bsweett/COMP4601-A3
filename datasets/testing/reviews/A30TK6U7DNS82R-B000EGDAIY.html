<meta name="summary" content="Good horror movie, and Grace Zabriskie is awesome."></head><body><p>If you haven't seen the original and just want to watch an American remake, this is the one for you, plus it has the bonus of featuring one of America's finest actresses, one often underused or ill utilized by directors who don't know what to make of her sterling talent.  I'm not talking about Sarah (BUFFY) Michelle Gellar, not this time, but instead I speak today of Grace Zabriskie, the actress who plays the elderly woman who sleeps on the floor and seems so haunted by the violent deaths of everyone she knows.<br /><br />Grace Zabriskie has one of those faces you've seen over and over again, often playing disturbed or Satanic mothers along the lines of Angela Lansbury's character in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  Her other forte is playing supportive, rather helpless and pathetic mothers who are nevertheless sweet and loving.  I first became aware of Ms. Zabriskie's sweeping talent while watching the US soap opera of the 1980s, SANTA BARBARA.  She took a nothing part and filled it with every kind of theatrical, filmic gesture, elevating an ordinary show into the kind of thing you would tape every day just on the off chance that she would make an appearance on it.  (That's actually not fair to SB which in many ways was one of the most innovative shows on TV.)  Then my friends who knew I liked Grace Zabriskie would call me and tell me they had spotted her in other shows and films.  She played one of the hardened factory hands in NORMA RAE and she excelled in DRUGSTORE COWBOY.  She was the mother of Laura Palmer in the series of TWIN PEAKS, and she was Debra Winge's mother in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN.  Need I say more?  For twenty-five years she has been giving us her all, and in THE GRUDGE she gives no quarter to the general shoddiness of the production.  She attacks the part as though she were playing Gertrude in HAMLET (which she is in a way).  Watch her as she turns white, and her struggles for breath, and her anguished pleas to Sarah Michelle Gellar, the co-star with whom she seems to have the most empathy.  If they had an entry for GREATNESS in the dictionary, there would be a little picture of Grace Zabriskie to illustrate the noun.<br /><br />By the way, she is a talented writer too, much more talented than the screenwriters of most of the movies, and she's made almost 100!</p></body></html>

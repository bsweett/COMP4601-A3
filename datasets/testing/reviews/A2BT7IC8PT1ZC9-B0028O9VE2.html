The one thing<br /><br />in this movie I thought was really stupid was, hiring someone<br /><br />to take care of your family, that speaks absolutely no english!<br /><br />How the hell are you supposed to communicate with each other!<br /><br />It starts off very slow, but picks up after the first half hour.<br /><br />Don't expect to see a classic film, but it's not that bad.</p></body></html>

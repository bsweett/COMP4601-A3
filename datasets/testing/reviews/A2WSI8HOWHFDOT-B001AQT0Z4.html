But if you want to know about the incredible stuff packaged in here then let me tell you that this DVD set is worth it. <p>The scenes that were edited out were extraneous, although I enjoyed Uma asking Travolta whether he was a Beatles or Elvis fan. The international trailers for the film were okay. But for any fan of this incredible film, what makes the set worth the price are three things: the synchronized trivia game, the independent spirit awards footage, and, if you missed it, the dialog with Charlie Rose. All together this will tell you why PULP FICTION is an established classic already, and will be for generations to come.<p>Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS</p></body></html>

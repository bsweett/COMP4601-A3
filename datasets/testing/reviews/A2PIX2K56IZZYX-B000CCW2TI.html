<meta name="summary" content="Wes Craven made a boring movie? nah, couldnt be................"></head><body><p>Ya, he pretty much did, the director of some of the better horror/suspense movies of the past few years, the Scream trilogy, Cursed, and of course Elm Street, managed only a few yawns from me this time out. The two leads are fine, Rachel McAdams, who is everywhere these days, plays Lisa. McAdams is very pretty and a decent actress, she played this well, but the script really didn't let her do much. Most of the credit goes to Cillian Murphy (If you remember he was the scarecrow in Batman Begins, another yawn inducer) I liked that he played this evil character with a slight human side, not all terrifying and cold like we usually see. But, even his cool performance couldn't save this from being just boring and not very suspensefull.<br /><br />I found it really hard to believe that this movie could waste the talent of one of Hollywood's most under-rated and one of my personal favorite actors, Brian Cox. This man always brings it to his roles, specially when he plays a baddie. But this time he plays Lisa's dad and had very few scenes, and worse yet, the few he was in were weak and pointless. If you ever want to really enjoy Brian Cox, I strongly, strongly recommend an X-Box game called Manhunt, he does the voice for Starkweather, a real low human being, it's mesmerizing, I swear.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Lisa taking a Red-Eye flight to get home after the funeral of her grandmother only to be sitting next to a  highly intelligent, yet very dangerous 'hitman'. Seems he was hired to kill the head of Homeland Security, who just happens to be staying at the hotel Lisa is a manager of. If she does not help him, he will have his partner kill her dad as he is stationed just outside his house sitting in a parked BMW. Of course she attempts to let someone on the plane secretly know what's going on, but Murphy catches her everytime. This all leads to a very poor ending with no suspense build-up at all.<br /><br />I love and own almost every single Wes Craven title, I think the first Scream and the Nightmare series are some of the finest horror movies ever, but I will not buy this, and I know it did fairly decent at the box-office (58 million for a horror movie is pretty good) But I hope Craven is not planning a sequel, like he usually does. Maybe we could get a sequel to Cursed, which was a far better horror movie then Red Eye. Upon returning this and Serenity, I rented Venom and Transporter 2, so I'll see all of ya real soon..........<br /><br />acting........3.5 stars, McAdams is awesome, Murphy too, But Cox is sooooo wasted<br /><br />directing.......2.5 stars, Pretty boring stuff from Mr. Craven<br /><br />special effects.....2 stars, Poor, what little there is<br /><br />horror rating.....1.5 stars, No suspense or chills at all<br /><br />quality......3 stars, Craven's movies always look good, not his best here, but not terrible.</p></body></html>

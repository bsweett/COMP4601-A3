<meta name="summary" content="Sci-Fi with a story"></head><body><p>Normally CGI laden F/X films are lacking in either the f/x part, the story, the acting, or the execution or sometimes in all the areas. Here is a film which succeeds despite its vague sounding story line because it fires on all cylinders.<br />A man wakes up in a cylinder, this man is Jake Gylenhaal, who thinks he is in Afghanistan but instead is sitting on a train to Chicago which is about to blow up in 8 minutes. He is a part of a experiment and has to continue reliving this explosion until he figures out who caused it.<br />I found it very hard to review this film but you will not have a hard time liking it.  4 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I still prefer the Japanese original"></head><body><p>I watched both the original Japanese version and the American remake, and I must say that I still prefer the original. The American remake is pretty good, but the silent eeriness that's constant in the original works more for me rather than the high-voltage "jump" effects. Plus, eighteen-year old Sadako is much scarier than ten-year old Samara. But performance-wise, Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson are more believable. Plus, Brian Cox is in the film, so it brings my grade up a notch. Finally, there's the cursed videotape. The longer American version is all for disturbing images and shrieking sound effects, while the original is only forty seconds long and contains only one scary image. I do believe I like the tapes equally (though I definitely wouldn't want to die in seven days when I watch them).<br /><br />All in all, The American Ring works for its shock effects and its horrifying climax. I just prefer the original Japanese Ring for its silent eeriness and steady pacing.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></body></html>

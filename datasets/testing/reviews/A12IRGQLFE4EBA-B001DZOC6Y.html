<meta name="summary" content="Graceful Characters, Interesting Story"></head><body><p>I'm noticing an interesting trend in Mr. Shyamalan's movies.  While the "threat" or "main issue" of the movie is often dramatic and horrifying, the dialogue and relationships of the characters are usually delicate and graceful.  There's a beautiful subtly to his movies that tug at your heart ever so gently.  All of his main characters have wounded souls that, somehow through the difficulty they confront in the course of the story, figure out their greatest strengths.  Not every ending is a perfect one and not every loose end is neatly tied and I wonder if that's why so many are walking away from his movies disappointed.  There's no bang-bang shoot em' up or excessive gratuitous sex in every scene.  I really walk away feeling connected to the people in his films.  They seem like everyday people (with the exception of a few supernatural powers in some of his films - lol) with everyday internal struggles and I like that.<br /><br />The Happening's characters are really no different than any of Mr. Shyamalan's other films, but the story is definitely different.  No one ever fully answers the question of what is happening, yet there is a perfectly scientific plausibility to the event.  I felt a myriad of emotions from fear and panic to being intrigued with how the story unfolded and ultimately how it ended.<br /><br />This was a good movie.  I think what so many viewers are dissatisfied with is M. Night Shyamalan's style.  He's a unique director and producer just like Quentin Terantino is... you either like his style or you don't.  The Happening was a great story with great characters and a lot of heart.</p></body></html>

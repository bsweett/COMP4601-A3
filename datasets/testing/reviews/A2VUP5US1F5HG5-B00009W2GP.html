<meta name="summary" content="VIVA LA REVOLUTION"></head><body><p>Even though I found Matrix Reloaded a major disappointment, I still knew without doubt I would have to see Revolutions when it came out.  There was too much potential that just might yet be fulfilled, too many loose ends just begging to be tied.  While hardly a cinematic masterpiece, Revolutions is indeed a fulfilling climax to the Matrix series.  There are the usual bugaboos:  mediocre acting (except for the outstanding Hugo Weaving), a slew of rather unlikeable protagonists (I can't bring myself to like any of the characters except the big three of Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus) and an often ameaturish script, but one recurring problem with the Matrix--all the overblown psychobabble posing as philosophy--actually makes some sense this time around.  Some die-hard Matrix fans may be disappointed by the relative lack of action in this entry, but don't be fooled by a few negative reviews into thinking the Matrix has gone soft.  Revolutions packs some devastating punches, they're just more concentrated this time.  The robotic invasion of Zion is spectacular (if a bit unimaginative), Neo's encounter with a "real-world" Agent Smith is intense and provocative, and of course the ultimate showdown is a mindblowing exhibition that does NOT end as you'd expect.  As a Christian, by far the most powerful element for me in Revolutions is the strong Christ-imagery, which comes full circle in the moving finale.  Perhaps this is one turn-off for Matrix devotees who like to see the series as a repudiation of any orthodoxy.  Funny how so many "open-minded" people refuse to be at all open to any concept of an absolute truth.  Of course, Revolutions incorporates themes from several philosophies, but in the end it is the Christian element that shines most strongly.  In any event, there's something here for anyone who's come this far into the saga. As a slick package of modern spirituality, pop psychology, killer action, conspiracy theory, and high-octane FX, the Matrix Series is a winner that is ultimately more than the sum of its parts. And Revolutions is the story's climactic exclamation point.</p></body></html>

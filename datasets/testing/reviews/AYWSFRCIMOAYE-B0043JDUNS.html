<meta name="summary" content="Overhyped + Brief fighting scenes  + More about Tony Stark's personal trouble than Ironman"></head><body><p>This movie spent more time depicting Tony Stark's personal trouble than Ironman's achievements. That made it more like a drama. Yet, it's a half-baked drama because  it's not given enough time to move me. Just when the drama was building up, it moved to the action scenes. However, these were too brief to provide excitement. For example, the fighting at the race track looked good but it ended too quickly. The last action scenes with hundreds of Ironman clones looked like cartoon.<br /><br />There were less funny dialogues than the first film.<br />Overall, this picture is over-hyped.</p></body></html>

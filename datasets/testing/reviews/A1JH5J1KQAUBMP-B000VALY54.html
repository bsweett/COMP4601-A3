<meta name="summary" content="Self-conscious noir"></head><body><p>A small-time crook (Robert Downey Jr) stumbles into an audition while running from police and ends up with a free ticket to LA, where he becomes involved in a complicated scheme along with his high school sweetheart (Michelle Monaghan) and a gay PI (Val Kilmer).  There is much to enjoy here, including some laugh-out-loud moments and some enthusiastic skewering of action movie cliches.  In the end, however, it is a little too cute and self-conscious, though never boring.  Stick around for the credits. Robert Downey Jr. co-wrote and performs the final song.</p></body></html>

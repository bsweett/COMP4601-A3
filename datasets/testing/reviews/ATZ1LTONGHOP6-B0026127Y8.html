<meta name="summary" content="Violence solves everything"></head><body><p>Retired CIA agent, Bryan (Liam Neeson) must call on all of his past job skills when his teenaged daughter (Maggie Grace) and her friend are kidnapped by people traffickers, while on vacation in France.<br /><br />I really enjoyed "Taken". It is a really dumb film with "violence solves everything" as its central message (and the incongruously heavy themes of drugs, prostitution and slavery, but lets not dwell on those), but in spite of these things (or perhaps because of them), it was exciting, fast-moving and a really fun movie to watch. Although starting to look a bit on the old side, Neeson does a commendable job as a former spy called back into action and surprisingly he makes this piece of far-fetched fluff seem somewhat believable...somewhat.<br /><br />The script of "Taken" is co-written by Luc Besson, who is among my favourite writers, and although not of the calibre of "Leon - The Professional", or even "Taxi",  Besson is still a better writer than most action film writers out there and as a results, this film is well worth your time and money.</p></body></html>

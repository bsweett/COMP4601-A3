Will Smith (who also served as a producer on the film) (as Chris Gardner) gives the best performance (and recently, Golden Globe-nominated) of his career yet and the scenes with him and his son, played ironically, by his real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, are beautifully well-done. The directing by Gabriele Muccino is excellent. The story and screenplay by Steve Conrad (who also wrote "The Weather Man" (2005), which is also based on Gardner's real-life autobiography, is excellent. The music by Andrea Guerra (who was Golden Globe nominated for Best Original Song for "Hotel Rwanda" (2004) is excellent. The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (who is also doing the cinematography to the upcoming "3:10 To Yuma" (2007) is excellent. The film editing by Hughes Winborne (who won the Oscar for his work on "Crash" (2005) is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian (who, recently did the casting to "Deja Vu" (2006) is excellent. The production design by J. Michael Riva (who is also doing the production design to the upcoming "Spider-Man 3" (2007) & "Iron Man" (2008) is excellent. The set decoration by Lauri Gaffin (who is also doing the set decoration to the upcoming "Iron Man" (2008) is excellent. The costume design by Sharen Davis (who also did the costume design to "Dreamgirls" (2006) is excellent. Will Smith has never been better in his performance as Chris Gardner, a sure-fire Oscar nomination for his performance.</p></body></html>

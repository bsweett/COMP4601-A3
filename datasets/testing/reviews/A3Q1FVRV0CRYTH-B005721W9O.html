In the film a group of washed up actors from the TV series `Galaxy Quest' are asked to help a group of aliens led by Mathesar (Colantoni) defend their people against the evil Sarris (Sachs).  In an attempt to have some `fun' Jason (Allen), the cocky jerk who was once the captain of their `ship' decides to agree and reluctantly the rest of the cast does too.  Along the way they learn to trust and care about one another, and they also get themselves in some pretty corny, yet funny, situations.  What makes this film even better than just a spoof of a series is that it spoofs a phenomenon by having our characters signing autographs at `Galaxy Quest Conventions' where `trekie' type fans have gathered, and in the end they must rely on a group of these fans to save them from peril.  If you want a good time full of laughs then `Galaxy Quest' is the ride for you.  The cast, including Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Sam Rockwell, Tony Shalhoub and Daryl Mitchell are great in their roles and add much needed comic relief.  All in all it's a great attempt at a parody.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The definitive guilty pleasure film"></head><body><p>"Army of Darkness" is filmed, acted, and written so tongue-in-cheek that I'm amazed they didn't wear holes through the sides of their faces. While the set pieces, battle sequences, and cinematography are as masterful as any Spielberg film, "Army of Darkness" was obviously made simply with the idea of making it an all-out entertaining picture and it succeeds in that way, on every level. The physical comedy element from "Evil Dead 2" returns with a vengeance; I've seen this movie more than fifty times and every gag still works. But instead of the cabin in the woods and sense of isolation that we felt in the preceeding two films, "AOD" has the scope of a grand-scale sword and sorcery epic, using its visual effects to turn backlots in Los Angeles into vast stretches of woodsy nothingness.<p>The movie's not much in the area of plot. It doesn't need to be. Movies like "Army of Darkness" are not about elaborate plot devices and subplots and dramatic pauses; they're about action, and giving us as the popcorn-stuffing audience members a good time for our money. A lot of the credit for all these successes goes to Bruce Campbell, as our main everyman character: The moron, the braggart, the blowhard, Ash. God love em. True, the idea of Ash being a cowardly character has completely left the story for the idea of him becoming this leader of men that we root for. True, the logistics of the film suffered in the editing process. And true, we never really see Ash reload his gun before he fires again. But does it matter? Not at all. The film moves too fast for us to care. The action sequences are so well executed that we can forgive the movie for just about anything, and the fact that it has an enormous sense of humor about itself doesn't hurt either. Classifying it as a horror film does it a discredit. It's not a horror film at all; it's not even one of those self-parodies that are so popular these days since Kevin Williamson had the cahones to write "Scream". It's an action-comedy that sky rockets into a stratosphere all its own in both categories. Both coexist in perfect balance most of the time, once in a while tipping in one direction or the other. The result is a masterpiece.<p>Sam Raimi learned a lot from the days of "Evil Dead" developing an involving visual style and a sense for drama which he used on "A Simple Plan" and "The Gift". This is all well and good, and those films gave him the critical merit to direct "Spider-man", but I think his job on "Army of Darkness" gave him the real tools needed. And even if "Spider-man" becomes the enormous success that's expected, he'll always be remembered for his cult favorite series that began with a group of college kids in a cabin being killed off by an invisible force, one by one, leaving only Ash, who lived and carries "Army of Darkness" on his shoulders - bouncing up and down with laughter all the way.</p></body></html>

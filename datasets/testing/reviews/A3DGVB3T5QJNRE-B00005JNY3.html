<meta name="summary" content="Despite Hollywood's Desperate PR Campaign This Flick Is NO Sixth Sense!"></head><body><p>Mildly clever! Wholly Unsatisfying! Comparing a masterpiece, like the Sixth Sense, to this film is an insult to our collective movie goers intelligence!<br /><br />I left the theater feeling empty and disappointed. Like most normal people, I don't like unmitigated evil triumphing over  genuinely good people!<br /><br />What is Hollywood thinking these days? That by being brave and selfless, one will become crippled and have the life sucked out of them at the hands of psychopaths? Wow! That's a "liberal" message if I ever heard one! - Don't stick you're neck out, or else. Forget about being responsible, just abandon the weak to the strong, the innocent to the ruthless, or else share the poor sap's fate!<br /><br />What does this enlightened film say about spirituality: It's all magic; and cruel magic is stronger than benevolent power!  And if you don't believe, the more powerful evil won't exist at all. So its wise to be a non-believer! Talk about cynical!<br /><br />This movie is also not flattering to women. If you're a kind-hearted woman, you're a bit dopey. But if you're a bad woman, boy are you smart!<br /><br />What other tidbits of wisdom can we gather from Hollywood? Sacrificing children is okay because the ends justify the means! Being rich is bad. The poor are blind. Middle class babes from New Jersey, and other points North, are rubes! Lawyers are frauds! Hoodoo is not Voodoo! (Listen for this line, I'm not kidding!) The medical profession is grossly incompetent! Law enforcement is clueless! Life is just a survival of the fitest, plain and simple! The search to prolong human life will lead to certain depravity! Ad nauseam!<br /><br />I think you get the picture! There wasn't a single positive message in this entire fim! Who writes this stuff? And Hollywood is wondering why people are staying away from the theaters in record numbers this summer! Perhaps it's time they started recruiting writers with a tad bit more faith in humanity! I guarantee it will sell more tickets!</p></body></html>

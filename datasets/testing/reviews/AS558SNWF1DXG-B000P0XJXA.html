<meta name="summary" content="A one-man army tears his way through Mametland"></head><body><p>No matter what the posters or previews promise, writer-director David Mamet's movies, such as "Spartan," neither look nor sound like anybody else's movies.<br /><br />Mamet began his career as a playwright and honed a peculiar style of dialogue, intentionally scripting lines full of repetition, stammers, pauses and profanity that feel both natural and artificial.<br /><br />He later shifted to movies, mostly fables about cops, con artists, gamblers and gangsters, and he cranks out one twisty, idiosyncratic brainteaser after another. In his films, such as "The Spanish Prisoner," "Homicide" and "Heist," everything means something but very little means what it appears, and this complexity, coupled with his dialogue, will understandably drive some people right up the wall.<br /><br />In "Spartan," Val Kilmer plays a mysterious "spec ops" agent working with the Secret Service to recover a kidnap victim. The captive is a young woman whose identity and significance only come into focus for the viewer as Kilmer's character follows her trail, using bluffs and beatings to leap from one clue to the next.<br /><br />No attempt has been made to spoon-feed the complicated plot to the viewer; the story has almost no exposition and characters don't get much introduction, but the film moves so fast and so confidently that the viewer doesn't really have time to worry about it. In fact, I motored along with "Spartan" for nearly an hour before it suddenly occurred to me that the story itself was completely ridiculous, but by that time I had already been pulled in and didn't mind a bit.<br /><br />Overall, the movie feels like a cinematic crossword puzzle rather than an actual story, but the twists and turns are satisfying. "Spartan" also gets a lot of mileage out of Kilmer, who seems to be bucking for a comeback and turns in a strong, plausible performance; fans of DVD extras may also enjoy Kilmer's solo commentary, which is spacey and tongue-in-cheek but which is surprisingly interesting and pretty hilarious to boot.</p></body></html>

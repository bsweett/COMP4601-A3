<meta name="summary" content="Tony Montana:  The Rise and Fall of a Notorious Gangster"></head><body><p>&quot;Me?  I want what's coming to me...  The world, Chico--and everything in it.&quot; - Tony Montana<p>&quot;Scarface&quot; was a box-office flop when it first came out and was literally trashed by almost every film critic that you can think of.  Many years later, it's considered a classic and some say it's one of the most influential gangster movies to ever to be made.  There's real power that cannot be denied that is held within this amazing masterpiece that has one of the highest replay values I've ever experienced.  I can NEVER get tired of this outstanding gangster epic, and it is a grand event that stands out from most crime sagas--and most films althogether.<p>Tony Montana came to America with nothing, with the exception of a dream to become a somebody; a successful and powerful somebody.  He turns to a life of crime and slowly but surely becomes a well-established gangster. However, Tony becomes greedier and more consumed with power as the days go by, and it's only a matter of time before he starts to want it all.  His &quot;wanting it all&quot; leads him to his ultimate demise that will consume his fate.  This is a story about starting with nothing and then having everything--only to lose it all in then end.<p>Words cannot even begin to describe how passionately I feel about this movie.  This is a crime saga that has layers of character and story.  It isn't just a senseless bloodbath with mindless violence around every corner.  No, this movie has a certain path and structure.  Al Pacino literally makes the role of &quot;Tony Montana&quot; his own and never loses sight of it for a second.  I can't think of another character that is &quot;impersonated&quot; in the real world more than Pacino's &quot;Tony Montana.&quot;  The film is brilliantly written by Oliver Stone (who deemed this movie as his farewell to cocaine), and is perfectly executed by director Brian DePalma.  This film had an amazing cast and crew behind it, which made it the success that it is today.<p>This Two-Disk Anniversary Edition is fully packed with some great extras.  One of the main things that is so great about the DVD is the incredible audio and picture transfer that is COMPLETELY superb in contrast with the older version.  While it's easier to note the difference in picture with a bigger (and perhaps even a widescreen) television, you should still be able to tell the difference and come to the conclusion that this new transfer is much better than the original.  Extra features included are deleted scenes, documentaries, a &quot;TV Version&quot; montage that is absolutely priceless, and a hip-hop feature that shows interviews with some of today's hottest rappers and how they deem this movie as a &quot;ghetto classic.&quot;  While the DVD could've had a few more extra features, it is in no way disappointing.<p>&quot;Scarface&quot; is a timeless classic that seems to get bigger and bigger as the years roll by.  It's a rare breed of film that can never be duplicated in a successful manner.  I find it truly amazing how a film started off so weak when it first came out only to become the legend that it is today.  If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend that you give it a viewing as soon as possible.  It is, and forever will be, one of my absolute favorites.</p></body></html>

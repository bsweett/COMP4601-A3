<meta name="summary" content="Difficult to follow"></head><body><p>Based on a true unsolved murder in the 40s, the fragmented pieces of the plot are truly difficult to follow. 2 murders were eventually solved but the ending was weak and unsatisfying. One big flaw is the lack of depth, substance and character development of Kay (Scalett Johansson) and the wealthy socialite Madeleine (Hilary Swank). With strong actresses like these, they could have achieved something. Instead, Kay was a homemaker who sat at home helplessly waiting for bad news. Madeleine seemed to have nothing else to do but plot evil. To make it worse, they threw themselves at Bucky (Josh Hartnett) for no apparent reasons. Here is the irony - the harder these intelligent looking actresses tried to follow their parts, the more ridiculous the characters looked. Even a good cast could not pull this one off.</p></body></html>

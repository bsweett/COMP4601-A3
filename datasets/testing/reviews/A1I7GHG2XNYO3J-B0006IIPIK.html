What ever you call it there is non stop action and the film truly has a 1940's serial feel to it. While the "critics" didnt seem to like it much i was very much taken with the effects and for once in a modern film the comic relief was refreshingly comic. While im sure its not for everyone i would recomend this movie as one of the better ones to come from the ever failing hollywood. Where remakes and shallow attemps at drama abound this one is truly unique and quite a fun watch.</p></body></html>

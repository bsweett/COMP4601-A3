This is a very good political action thriller that has high-octane action and lots of suspense. Unfortunately, some of the casting is a bit off: Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman give wooden performances. That's why I can't give this movie five stars (well, that and a few draggy scenes). Still, The Kingdom is a tightly written, well-directed, and highly explosive political action film. It doesn't have as much as action as, say, Hard Boiled or Face/Off, but it does give a very powerful message about terrorism and the negative perceptions about Islam and Muslims in general. This film doesn't disrespect Islam, but it does tell us about how people use religion as an excuse to get a point across. All in all, this is a good action film that's worth seeing if you're into politics, religion, and of course, action.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

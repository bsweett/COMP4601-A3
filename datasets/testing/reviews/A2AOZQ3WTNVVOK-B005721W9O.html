<meta name="summary" content="After the Show Is Over"></head><body><p>When the entertainment industry pokes fun at itself sincerely, the results can be hilarious.  Such is the case with the cornball science fantasy movie "Galaxy Quest."<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest" was a science fiction television show with more than a passing similarity to "Star Trek."  As with the latter show, "Galaxy Quest" was cancelled.  Now the dispirited actors seem doomed to an endless cycle of overzealous fans at "Galaxy Quest" conventions.  Adding to the actor's torment is the attitude of Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart in the show.  Nesmith's cheery attitude and self-importance have worn thin on his fellow cast mates, Gwen Demarco as sexy Lt. Tawny Madison (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane as brainy Dr. Lazarus (Alan Rickman), and Fred Kwan as Tech Sgt. Chen (Tony Shalhoub).<br /><br />Interrupting their doldrums is a group of individuals who would appear weird to anyone outside a science fiction convention.  As members of the convention they appear to be about as strange, or normal, depending on your point of view, as anyone else.  However, Jason Nesmith soon learns that this strange foursome is more than they seem as they spirit him off to their genuine spaceship, NSEA Protector.<br /><br />At first Jason is somewhat excited at the opportunity to be on a genuine spaceship, and eventually brings the rest of the crew, including bit part player Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), back to the ship with him.  However, the aliens crewing the ship, the Thermians, have a very real, very ruthless nemesis to contend with, and the former crew of "Galaxy Quest" discover they are out of their depth.<br /><br />The Thermians brought the crew of "Galaxy Quest" on board because they discovered certain "historical documents" that were transmitted into space many years earlier.  The somewhat innocent, though highly intelligent and creative, Thermians were unable to recognize the television show "Galaxy Quest" as being make-believe.<br /><br />The movie moves forward with a number of creative and often humorous moments, alternating between hilarity and seriousness, with even a few moments of compassion.  Every clich&eacute; and stereotype from the original "Star Trek" is exploited for a laugh.  In the climax the actors rely on hardcore fans for their in-depth knowledge of the show to save them.  It is difficult to avoid enjoying the ending, even if you are not a fan of science fiction.<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest" is an excellent companion movie to the original "Star Trek" television series.  Even non-Trek fans will pick up on most of the gags.  There is a lot of action and you can expect the usual implausibilities that tend to accompany television science fiction.  However, the results are humorous and enjoyable.  You will find this movie worth more than one watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Spanish Inquisition Takes A Bath Below The Cliffs Of Dover"></head><body><p>ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a costume drama based on the factual life of Queen Elizabeth I (played by Cate Blanchett, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OY8NBK">The Good German</a>). Blanchett reprises her role as the highly successful mother to a nation -- England -- from the 1998 film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth</a>.<br /><br />With gorgeous costumes and scrumptious period locations, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a very successful film. The dizzying camera work helps portray the immensity of the structures built for the times, and the dark qualities of rooms during stormy nights or barbaric incarcerations is shown exceptionally well.<br /><br />The focus on this film (versus that of its predecessor) is on the time of prosperity coming due for England as it comes out from under the oppressive thumb of the overzealous Catholic King Philip II of Spain (played by Jordi Molla) during the Spanish inquisition. The ultimate destruction of Spain's navy during a horrendous storm ushers in a time of peace for England. Initially Elizabeth is besieged with matters that demand her attention, all while loving vicariously through one of her women in waiting, "Bess" (Abbie Cornish) who is enamored (as is the Queen herself) with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XA5K48">Shoot 'Em Up</a>).<br /><br />Being able to reduce herself to a normal woman for even a brief moment is an incredible pleasure to the Queen, and Sir Raleigh allows her these moments whenever he's around. But both know that they can never be together; the Queen because of what's required of her as a noblewoman; and Raleigh because he's basically a pirate with no royal blood. But Raleigh gets as close as he dares by falling for Bess, and eventually marrying her, much to the dismay of the Queen (who, although she knew she and Raleigh could never be together, still dreamt of it).<br /><br />The end of the Spanish armada signals the end of many things: the end of threats from beyond the sea, the end of Elizabeth's possible marriage arrangements, the end of Mary Queen of Scots, and the end of any hopes for a life with someone the likes of Raleigh. But it also heralded a time of awesome prosperity during the incredibly long reign of one of the most successful leaders of the free world.<br /><br />Watching it, one can't help but wonder what would've happened had the Spanish fleet found purchase on the shores of England. Thankfully that never happened and, as an American, I'm doubly glad for it.<br /><br />This is a very well filmed historical costume drama with plenty of outstanding performances and scenery. But it isn't anything we haven't seen before (the aforementioned 1998 Elizabeth film is the prime example). Although there's plenty to look at, most viewers will probably say, "Yeah. Seen it. Been there."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shamelessly clever, witty, twisty-turny intellectual thriller from Spike Lee"></head><body><p>Spike Lee has never been known for his subtlety.  He makes powerful films that are often smart ("Do the Right Thing"), occasionally not ("She Hate Me"), and sometimes brilliant ("Malcolm X," "4 Little Girls"), but there is never any question that Spike's first goal is to make an emotionally powerful film.<br /><br />Lee departs drastically from past practice with "Inside Man," a hyper-smart heist movie that adopts all the tricks of the genre.  While no "heist movie" is ever going to rise to the hallowed heights of "The Sting" in movie lore, Lee has made one heck of an enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Clive Owen plays criminal ringleader Dalton Russell, and he tells the audience in the opening scene (shattering the fourth wall) that he has done a bank job, and here's how he did it.  In broad daylight, Russell leads a handful of thieves into the downtown Manhattan branch of a powerful bank, founded in 1948 by Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer).  Within moments, Russell has taken about forty hostages and has the bank surrounded by cops and media.  And yet he hasn't touched the money and seems hardly perturbed.  Why?<br /><br />This question dogs lead detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and his sidekick, Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  It's clear that Frazier and Mitchell are used to being smarter than the criminals they face, but Russell is clearly in a different league.<br /><br />Further muddying the waters is the appearance on the scene of Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) as a woman hired by Case to protect his interests in the bank . . . interests that are contained in security box 392.  Miss White (there's the trademark Lee subtlety at work) is the kind of person who gets to patronize the mayor of Manhattan and lord her power over mere mortals such as Detectives Frazier and Mitchell.  It's clear that Foster relishes this chance to play perhaps the biggest witch of her career, even if one wishes that Miss White were on screen a bit more.<br /><br />The heist proceeds through its paces with the typical cadence of move and countermove by police and criminal.  To summarize any more would be to give the game away, but like all great heist movies, "Inside Man" keeps you guessing right up until the very end.  The fact that upon reflection the whole story is completely ridiculous is beside the point - heist movies are more about style and wit than logic, and are at their best when one player is able to move among the others as if he or she has had an advance peek at the screenplay.<br /><br />Lee generally eschews his trademark focus on racial issues, and the few scenes where these arise feel contrived and beside the point.  Fortunately, Lee never lets the movie get bogged down in these moments, and to his credit, spends about as much time with sexism as he does racism.<br /><br />But never fear - this is an intelligent heist movie made by a talented, dedicated filmmaker.  Solid work by the entire cast makes "Inside Man" a pleasure to watch - Mr. Lee and his team should be very proud, and it's not surprising that this movie has been Lee's biggest box office hit yet, and a sequel appears to be in the works.</p></body></html>

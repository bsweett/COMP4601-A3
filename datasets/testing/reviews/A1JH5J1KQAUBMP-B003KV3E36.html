When they run into more than they bargained for, Rambo goes back in with a team of mercenaries to rescue them.<br /><br />The first Rambo movie was very well done and had a serious subtext concerning the shameful disregard of Vietnam vets after their return to the States.  The next two installments of the series were Cold War revenge fantasies that dishonored whatever noble intent may have existed in "First Blood."  With this final episode, Stallone sends his character off on a high note.  Most importantly, it is a riveting action flick.  However, it also dramatizes the terrible suffering and violence that occurs under sadistic strongman dictators.  This is the most graphic Rambo film by far, but it presents our hero as less of a ridiculous superman without taking anything away from his frightening efficiency as a killer.</p></body></html>

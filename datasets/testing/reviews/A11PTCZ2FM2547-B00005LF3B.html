<meta name="summary" content="A Celebration of the Indomitable Human Spirit"></head><body><p>I can think of only a handful of movies that have their audiences cheering the indefatigable resiliency of the human spirit.  "Papillon" certainly comes to mind, as does "Bridge Over the River Kwai."  CAST AWAY definitely can be added to such an elite list; director Robert Zemeckis and headliner Tom Hanks deliver an absorbing, intense story about one man's refusal to be involuntarily exiled for the remainder of his days.<br /><br />Oh, the things we take for granted.  Running water.  Hot food.  A roof over our heads.  Imagine your predicament should you suddenly find yourself with none of these things--imagine your predicament if you had virtually no survival skills.  Such is the fate of Tom Hanks' character (a retentive, nondescript FedEx midmanager); one minute he's on a flight over the Pacific; the next he's on a secluded beach.  And thus both the character and the audience embark on a journey of discovery, as neither the cast away nor those viewing this film know how the survivor will be able to. . .survive.<br /><br />Accordingly, the conflict of the plot stubbornly yields to a series of victories--the audience and the character are simultaneously elated:  elated when that first coconut is opened; when that first fire is started; when--after four long, solitary years--a durable raft is built that will transport its lone passenger beyond the unforgiving barrier reef.  And finally, following rescue, following the aftermath of a disheartening, yet poignant, reunion with a former lover (Helen Hunt makes the most out of this small, yet powerful, role), the audience celebrates when Hanks' character stands at the crossroads of a desolate Texas intersection--literally in the middle of nowhere.  For the viewers realize, as does the character, that following four years of rugged survival under harsh conditions, any subsequent obstacles or decisions are gravy.  Pure gravy.<br /><br />Tom Hanks singlehandedly and wonderfully carries this movie.  He's believable, compelling, empathetic--funny.  This is easily one of his signature roles; and CAST AWAY is a signature celebration of the indomitable human spirit.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, Walk-On</p></body></html>

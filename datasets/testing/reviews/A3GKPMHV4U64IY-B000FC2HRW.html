<meta name="summary" content="Intense and Different"></head><body><p>Much like the earlier films, we have a character who foresees a terrible accident and winds up saving a bunch of lives.  In trying to figure out what is going on, the protagonist comes across the idea of a camera having caught premonitions of how the survivors will die.  Another twist is that she is not sure who all got off of the roller coaster and is now in danger.  This time photographs provide clues to how death will catch up to the survivors.<br /><br />Much of the film is just what you would expect with the lead trying to warn people of their impending doom and lots of Rube Goldberg-style accidents.  Some of the action feels a little more intense that in the other films.  Certainly the ending is original and not just a rehash of the first two.  There is also the nice added tension supplied by not knowing who all is on the list.  When the final riders are identified it adds another dimension to the film.<br /><br />All in all a pretty predictable film but with a pretty good ending.  If you liked the first two films then there is no reason not to like this film except familiarity.  The acting was a little better than in the first (couldn't stand the lead in that one) and some of the writing is a little tighter.  There were obvious attempts to make the story fresh and new so it doesn't just wind up as a lame sequel.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

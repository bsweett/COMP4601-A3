Horrid at worst, lukewarm at best reviews later and I decided to wait.  I actually decided to wait until it came out on TV but I had the opportunity to see it without any money lost in my pocket and so I decided to give it a watch through.  The outset, story and even acting was all a nice start.  Owen and Aniston have great chemistry together, and Jennifer was able to effectively leave here Rachel behind.<br /><br />The story revolves around a passionate bad decision on the part of Charles (Owen) and Lucinda (Aniston) who are both married but end up attempting to be unfaithful.  I say attempt because their plan is foiled by a masked mugger (Cassel) who in turn rapes Lucinda and beats Charles and then leaves them.  What appears to be a one time freak coincidence turns into a game of cat and mouse as this man demands money from both Charles and Lucinda to keep their secret of infidelity from their spouses.<br /><br />What could have been great falls a bit tired at the end, and I will admit that I did guess the big twist about half way through which made it a bit uneventful, but the acting was far better than I expected (I mean it stars among others RZA and Xzibit but shockingly both, especially RZA, do good here) and the overall experience was one that you won't fully regret.  It's nothing brilliant but it sure is entertaining.</p></body></html>

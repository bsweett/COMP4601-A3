<meta name="summary" content="Phonation"></head><body><p>People walk in front of my house, talking talking on their cell phones. They talk loudly about personal things, like no one can hear. The mind boggles. Meanwhile, this film was made, as entertainment that suits the mood of phones and fixation. Great cast and crew capture NYC with a sharp action film focused on a Phone Booth; and It's fun, it's short and it's a red hot pistol.<br />Blu-ray looks good and sounds good; real good!</p></body></html>

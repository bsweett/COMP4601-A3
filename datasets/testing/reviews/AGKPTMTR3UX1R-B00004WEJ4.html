I've seen both. CITIZEN KANE has an indefinable air of confidence in itself that makes it "greater," but in terms of entertainment value, CITIZEN KANE is relegated to film school classes while CASABLANCA belongs to the viewer.<br /><br />CASABLANCA is so full of gifted dialogue that people who have never seen the film know it's lines . . . "You must remember this," the opening line of the theme song, "As Time Goes By," "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship," "We'll always have Paris," "Here's looking at you, Kid," "Of all the gin joints in all the world, she walks into mine," and "Round up the usual suspects" are cultural markers. Even the scat dialogue, "Play it again, Sam" was the title of a Woody Allen homage to CASABLANCA; that line is never spoken in CASABLANCA itself. The nearest line is, "Play it, Sam, for old times' sake."<br /><br />So much of CASABLANCA is in the casting. Many of the extras and repetoire players were in fact refugees from Hitler's Europe. Humphrey Bogart is the lead, ruggedly, though not impossibly handsome, while his love interest, played by Ingrid Bergman,  has inspired me to sit my son down in front of the screen with the explanation, "That's a GIRL." Claude Rains plays the witty, amoral Captain Louis Renault with a gleam in his eye. Sidney Greenstreet, "leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, an influential and respected man" makes suggestions, "why I do not know, since it cannot possibly profit me."<br /><br />In the days CASABLANCA was made, lower-budget films were churned out weekly by the studios, in reliance on stock characters, a stable of contract character actors, and quick-drawn scripts. This film has a natural chemistry---not a scene unneeded, a line unnecessary---that lifted it above its origins.  There are other similar films of the period with essentially the same cast. None of them is CASABLANCA.<br /><br />If you've never seen CASABLANCA, SEE IT. You are missing one of life's great pleasures and treasures. For those of you who haven't, it is the story of Rick Blaine, an American expatriate living in Casablanca at the end of 1941. He owns Rick's Cafe Americain, a classy nightclub where the denizens of wartime Casablanca---Arabs, Frenchmen, Nazi soldiers, spies, smugglers, thieves, Resistance Fighters, war refugees, and the merely unanchored---congregate nightly in order to conduct what business they can.  Although once a supporter of humanitarian causes, Blaine is now hopelessly cynical, and sticks his neck out for nobody.<br /><br />This "wise foreign policy" begins to unravel, when the black marketeer, Signor Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is arrested in the cafe for murder. What no one but Rick knows is that Ugarte has obtained two laissez-passer from his victims, exit visas he is planning to sell "for more money than you can possibly even imagine" to the Freedom Fighter Viktor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Laszlos arrive. Ugarte has left the passes in Rick's possession, but Rick has no intention of selling them, once he discovers that Mrs. Laszlo is the love of his life, Ilsa Lund. Rick and Ilsa met and fell deeply in love in Paris. It had been their plan to flee ahead of the Germans and marry once in a safe haven, but Ilsa chose to leave Rick at the last moment without any explanation.<br /><br />Rick's cynicism hardens into pure jadedness. Although he is aware that Laszlo is a great leader of the anti-Nazi underground, and though he knows that Laszlo will probably be killed unless he is helped to escape, Rick refuses any entreaties from Laszlo. Only Ilsa's loving heart saves his spirit; and renewed, he sends Viktor and Ilsa safely on to America.<br /><br />CASABLANCA is a true romance. From Laszlo's line to the German Kommandant, "You'll forgive me if I'm not gracious," to Ilsa's tearful explanation of her decision to leave Rick for his own safety, people simply never talked that way, nor acted that way in real life. They never stood on the airport tarmac in the fog saying noble things as they bid farewell forever. But there is something so glorious in the film that we wish we could be Rick and Ilsa. CASABLANCA is its audience, perfected.</p></body></html>

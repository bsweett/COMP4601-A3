I thought that Clive Owen deserved every accolade that was handed to him.  His performance was breathtaking and so full of life that his character was the one to watch for when each scene began.  He epitomized the level of good guy and bad guy all into one.  So, I was happy with his performance.  I was excited to see him playing well with others, but was this a great film?  At first, as I said before, I didn't think so, but then I thought about it.  This is one of those films that requires you to take a breath and think about the effects long after the final credits have finished rolling.  It takes your current relationship and places it right before your eyes.  This film will speak to anyone that has been in a relationship or is currently in one.  After watching it, you will think about your relationship and the horror will settle in.  This film will speak to you, it did me, and it really put into perspective the world of dating and relationships in this modern culture.  Nichols has crafted a masterpiece, and while it may not be appreciated as much now, it will remain in our society for a very long time.<br /><br />I have spoken briefly about the acting, but I would like to say that without a decent crew, this film could not have been as emotional as it was.  Julia Roberts turns in a performance that is very unlike her and will disappoint those who are die-hard fans, Natalie Portman proves that she is more than just Star Wars material, and Clive Owen ... Oh, Mr. Owen ... there could be nobody greater.  He controls this film and really takes his career into a new level.  I am not ashamed to say this, but I am a huge Clive Owen fan.  He does not disappoint in this film.  Then there is the snivelly Jude Law.  I must say, his performance in this film was the least impressive.  He somehow finds himself falling into very similar roles in each film that he picks up.  If you have seen Alfie, then you have seen a bit of him in Closer and vise versa.  He just isn't as great as he was when he first burst onto the cinematic scene.  Perhaps it is because he is wearing thin and cannot create fresh characters ... I dunno ... but whatever it is, he did not provide anything worth-wile to this film.<br /><br />So, with the acting strongly in place (sans Law), Nichols tips off the iceberg with some unprecedented cinematography that allows strong storytelling to take place.  One of the biggest elements to this film that captured my attention was Nichols ability to allow time to pass with the greatest of ease.  I thought at first that this film was going to happen within the course of a couple of days, but he builds a sense of a strong relationship by allowing it to pass over the course of several years.  You really get this feeling that these characters are together for a certain period of time and that development is occurring.  I never felt as if something suddenly happened, over the course of four years these acts of the heart take a form of their own through the watchful eye of Nichols.  It impressed me.  Also, Nichols' use of bold white coloring not only expressed the light of relationships, but also brought out the brilliance of each scene.  You became focused on certain elements, the purity of the heart, and so forth.  It was cinematic history in the making.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that this film was nothing of what I expected.  Natalie Portman's final scenes were riveting and really brought the rest of this film together.  Scenes in this film happened for a reason instead of just a chance to impress the audiences.  It was a delight to finally see a movie that came directly from the heart as well as shot to your heart.  It will invoke fear and make you appreciate the relationship that you have.  I have never experienced a film quite like this before and cannot wait to see what the brilliant mind of Mr. Mike Nichols will bring next to comment about our society and culture.  He does have his hand on the pulse of our lives, and Closer proves it.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film.  I have always been impressed with the work of Mike Nichols' work ever since I first experienced The Graduate and this film was no different.  He has this amazing ability of building tension and love together in the same bundle.  I remember feeling similar emotions during Closer as I did while watching The Graduate.  It is this ability to pull at your heartstrings while still maintaining that sense of realism.  I could connect to some portion of this film, and I loved it.  I strongly recommend this film, but do not take your gut reaction as the first response.  Think about this film, think about yourselves, and then make your decision.  It is what I did and somehow this film still remains in my mind weeks after viewing it.  I am impressed.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing, but not the travesty people are saying it is"></head><body><p>First off, I have only seen segments of the Liquid Television "Aeon Flux" animated episodes back in the 90's, so I'm not qualified to give an in-depth comparison to this movie. And two, I think politics should be left out of it...therefore I won't comment on Hollywood's left/right influence on this movie or anything like that. I'm reviewing it based on its merits alone and nothing else.<br /><br />That out of the way, I found "Aeon Flux" to be a dumbed-down, watered-down, yet entertaining version of the animated series. Although I have mentioned above that I didn't see that much of the original in the 90's, I saw enough of it to say that as usual, Hollywood has toned down the sex & violence so that it gets a safe, for-the-masses PG-13 rating. Fanboys of the original series are going to throw popcorn at the screen, and are advised to skip it. But for the rest of us, I suppose it's an adequate sci-fi/action brainless flick that doesn't challenge anyone and merely asks that one put their brain on neutral.<br /><br />Although Charlize Theron is WAY too attractive for the role of Aeon and basically phones in her performance, she does a commendable job with what she is given to work with. A large part of this movie relies on her sex appeal and it never apologizes for it. And in all fairness it does have some other good qualities, mainly the special effects and futuristic set designs that are at least original even if implausible. Some work could have been done on the fight sequences, which were amateur and even boring at times.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend "Aeon Flux," but only if you have some extra cash leftover and/or are a big fan of Charlize Theron (she is after all quite easy on the eyes in this movie). But if you're trying to save some money and want to limit your movie watching, give this one a pass and wait for "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe" or "King Kong," which will surely be light years better.</p></body></html>

This film pays homage, more than anything, to the work done by Richard Donner in the first two SUPERMAN films (That's right, I said the first TWO... because Donner was cut loose after filming approximately 70% of part 2) and the mythology of all of the screen incarnations, with Jack Larson (The old TV series' Jimmy Olsen) and Noel Neill (the serial's Lois Lane). That being said, this film is a joy to behold. It has heart and soul, some fantastic set pieces, and some of the most iconic imagery ever presented in a superhero film. Brandon Routh, coming in to fill the extremely large-sized boots of the late Christopher Reeve (who admittedly by pretty much everyone who ever either made or saw the previous films was born to play the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent) and he does an admirable job. He may look a little younger and a little slighter, but he does more in this film than just a Christopher Reeve impersonation (as he was essentially was accused of, which is a crock... the personae of Clark Kent/Superman was not created by Reeve, but merely perfected by him) and he does quite well. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor... I was very excited by this prospect since Spacey is one of the great working actors in film and stage now, and seeing him in this film, it only made the film stronger. His Lex is a little darker, and not quite as tongue-in-cheek as Gene Hackman's portrayal in the previous films, and he works the role to Spacey-esque proportions. The only real failing of casting in this film is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, and it has nothing to do with her level of talent since she is quite a talented actress. It does really have to do with her age... she seems impossibly young to play the grizzled, world-renowned, Pulitzer-winning intrepid reporter and mother. Erica Durance, who plays a much younger Lois Lane on the television show "Smallville" seems older than Bosworth and more than anything, Bosworth's young looks are more distracting as to take her out of the role. A misfire of casting though hardly diminishes the narrative and emotion of the scenes she plays with Routh, Spacey and the EXTREMELY underrated James Marsden as her fiance. The real star of this film though is its director, Bryan Singer, who helped Marvel prove that Superhero films could not only make money but be good as well with his work on the first two X-MEN films, and now has proved to DC that he can make Superman work again. The film takes well-paced breaks from the action that instead of hurting the flow, assist in the emotional investment. Singer is a director who is not afraid to take his time when dealing with characters. This was the only "blockbuster" film of the last summer that really gave you something worth your money, including a last moment homage to Reeve's portrayal that tugs heavily at the heartstrings and really does make you believe that a man can fly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Indy Jones does it again!"></head><body><p>I missed out on seeing this at the theatre but the DVD version was okay. It was your typical Indiana Jones movie with all the excitement and the chase scenes which to me is one of the hallmarks of this series. Harrison Ford did it again. I wonder if he will continue this at the age of 70? Anyway I thought it was okay!</p></body></html>

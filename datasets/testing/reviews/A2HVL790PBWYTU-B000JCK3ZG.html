Very quickly, this becomes a hot-button issue for non-mutants and mutants alike as the all-important question surfaces: does being a mutant constitute being diseased? Magneto, not only a mutant advocate but one who believes that mutants are the superior life form on earth, vehemently wants nothing of the cure and, in fact, seeks to annihilate the root of the cure - that being a little boy named Jimmy (Leech), himself a mutant who nullifies other mutants' powers. Magneto also continues to gather his power base, from which to wage his ongoing war against the "lesser" humanity. Simultaneous to these events, Jean Grey returns, but oh so terribly altered. She is now styled the (Dark) Phoenix and her psychic and telekinetic powers have increased exponentially and are controlled by an amoral persona. The ever beleaguered X-Men find themselves at a crossroad. Due to a catastrophic tragedy, the Xavier School for Gifted Students is in dire jeopardy of closing. Further, The X-Men are divided with the issue of the cure. Some, like Storm, believe there is nothing wrong with being a mutant. Some, like Rogue, just wants to fit in. But in the end, the X-Men must once more band together and protect humanity from Magneto's assaults.<br /><br />X-Men - The Last Stand pulls no punches. Key characters bite the big one in this possibly final installment, raising the angst level (as if it needed it) to new heights. X-Men has always been the comic book standard bearer for social issues and racial dynamics and this second sequel begs the question: what qualifies as humanity? And in comic book reality, with the supposition that mutants are real, as a "normal", how does one differentiate between persecution and self-preservation? Weighty matters for those who want to delve a little deeper. Me, I watch X-Men for the cool special effects.<br /><br />And what of the special effects? They are expertly awesome. The movie screen seems to show something impossible every 2 minutes and yet, these scenes are conveyed with fantastic realism. If a man could fly, if a woman could control the weather, if a man could manipulate metal - well, this is how it would look.<br /><br />I so enjoyed this movie, from start to finish. The principal actors have had 2 prior films to get to know their roles and by this third outing, they embody their characters with easy conviction. The movie's focus is again firmly on Wolverine and why not, as he's got his own film lined up? But Prof. Xavier, Storm, Magneto and Jean Grey are also given decent camera time. Secondary roles of import are Hank McCoy (the Beast), Bobby Drake (Iceman), and Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat). The cast of X-Men, the Brotherhood and other mutants is so large that short thrift is given to many characters. I wish more time had been devoted to Angel, Colossus, Mystique and Rogue. And I thought Multiple Man was a good guy? And where's Nightcrawler?<br /><br />Things to look for:  Magneto's awesome levitation of a massive bridge; the erudite Beast finally unleashed; that old staple, the Colossus/Wolverine fastball; Iceman vs. Pyro; and my personal favorite, Kitty Pryde takes on the unstoppable Juggernaut.<br /><br />Here's hoping that there's a fourth X-Men and that Gambit and/or Longshot are in it.<br /><br />Helpful hint: stick around until after the closing credits, there's more movie.</p></body></html>

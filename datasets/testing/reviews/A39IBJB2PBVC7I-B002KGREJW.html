<meta name="summary" content="Don't Miss Little Miss Sunshine"></head><body><p>Has there ever been a better metaphor for the challenges of uniting a family than this rag-tag band of emotionally bent gypsies pushing their ailing VW bus in order to get it going?  Times is tough for the Hoover clan, but somehow, miraculously, they make it.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear is faultless as the obsessively positive self-help guru wananabe, a homeless man's Tony Robbins.  Toni Collette is equally on point, here's a mom who serves dinner out of a box and empathy out of a scowl.  Secondary characters lift the level higher; Alan Arkin is hilarious as the smack-snorting gramps that coaches Olive in dancing and Dwayne in dating, his political incorrectness is simply inspiring.<br /><br />Writer Michael Arndt must be given high marks for this motley crew of characters.  Brother Frank, realized to perfection by Steve Carell of "The Office" fame, is a suicidal homosexual in danger of losing his title of world's leading Proust expert.  Dwayne, by contrast, is a teenage devotee of Nietzsche, consumed by hatred, strictly practicing a vow of silence. Watching their relationship evolve is particularly touching.<br /><br />As the bizarre events unfold, one knows that the payday will come at the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.  That said, when it does, you're still not ready for it.  Gramps, by now long gone, is so very alive in every bit of it.  It is uproariously funny, and very defiant too, mirroring Dwayne's rage.  Watching this family, and I use the word carefully, finding themselves on stage, for all the "perfect" world to see and ridicule, despise, and condemn - is joyful celebration.  A true "must see."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cool effects, cheesy acting"></head><body><p>When i saw this at the movies, I thought it had one of the coolest opening  scenes i'd seen, and the effects throughout the movie were great. After  seeing the movie a few times, the ooOO's and ahhh's have worn off, and I  really notice how cheesy the acting in this movie is. I still think that  the movie is half decent because of the special effects.</p></body></html>

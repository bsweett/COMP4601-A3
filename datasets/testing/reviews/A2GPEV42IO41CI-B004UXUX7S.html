<meta name="summary" content="Somber look at a dysfunctional family"></head><body><p>When Matt King (George Clooney)'s wife goes into a coma, he realizes how distant he was from her and from his two daughters.  Then he learns his wife was cheating on him.<br /><br />George Clooney plays against type as a clueless father and husband with baggy eyes and a beaten-down face.  He slouches through the story and generally looks pretty ordinary. He's good in the role, but not good enough to save the movie.  My first problem with it is the constant profanity used by the two young daughters; it's off-putting, to say the least.  Second, the story is a real downer, dealing with death, infidelity, and family struggles.  Third, it's relentlessly tedious, so monotonously depressing that it gets old fast.  And lastly, I didn't like or care about any of the characters.<br /><br />The Hawaiian scenery is beautiful and it represents unvarnished reality, but it's just not my idea of entertainment.</p></body></html>

I went to the show to see this movie and did not get it at all, so I rented it to see what I was missing. At the show, it just seemed like a lot of shooting, a guy trying to deal with his dramatic girlfriend, a trigger happy brother, a family man who's fighting the bad guy lifestyle, and a very confused brother who doesn't know whether he wants to be a rockstar or a gangster.  The four meet to find out who killed their brother and although the other three realize this may be heavier than they thought, there's always that one testosterone heavy guy who think he's Superman.  Mr. Testosterone is the ringleader in many fights, shoot-outs, and all four unite for justice.  This movie is proof of how brother bond, regardless of race, when loyalty comes into play.  I'm definitely glad I gave it a second chance.<br /><br />Side Note: The soundtrack music is on point.  Classic music by artists like the Temptations and Marvin Gaye play in the background, which makes this modern day western even cooler.  I wish the scene with Angel's character and the bathtub could've been shown in the deleted scenes so I could see whether it looked believable, but I cracked up at the "Bobby teases Jack" scene. I wish that would've been left in the movie to make Bobby's character more human (and hilarious).<br /><br />My only problem with this movie was Mark Wahlberg saying the n-word. I don't care how much or how long his character is supposed to be from the streets: there are still certain barriers not to be crossed.  Other than that, great movie.</p></body></html>

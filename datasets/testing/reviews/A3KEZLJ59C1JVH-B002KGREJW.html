<meta name="summary" content="Fun movie about a dysfunctional yet fabulous family"></head><body><p>"Little Miss Sunshine" is a spectacular movie about the hilarious but dysfunctional Hooper family. The parents, Richard and Sheryl (Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette), constantly bicker about Richard's futile efforts to become a self-help guru. Sheryl's teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano) refuses to speak to anyone due to the teachings of Friedrich Nietzsche. Frank (Steve Carell) is Sheryl's brother who recently attempted suicide, and Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is basically a dirty old man. The whole crazy family comes together when it's time for seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, and everyone piles into a clunky old VW van for the long weekend trip. Despite several bumps in the road, including the untimely death of one of their own, the Hoopers remain focused on their goal of getting Olive to the pageant on time. Unfortunately for Olive, she really isn't pageant material...in other words, she's normal. Things at the pageant don't exactly go as planned, but all of the Hoopers come out as "winners" in the end (except for poor Grandpa).<br /><br />I really enjoyed this fun, quirky little movie. The cast is excellent, but I was especially impressed with Arkin, whose foul-mouthed comments steal the show; Carell, who proves that he can handle a serious role; and the adorable Breslin, who is a delight to watch. I thought the ending of the film was a little abrupt (apparently there are a bunch of alternate endings included on the DVD, but I didn't see them). Other than that, though, this is a great movie about the family ties that bind: definitely worth watching.</p></body></html>

Starring Clint Eastwood, it is the experience of personal loss for all the lead characters in this film, which is a building block for their own greater development. The movie highlights many troubling social dynamics, often with an at times cranky old man's well aimed boot and good heart.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></body></html>

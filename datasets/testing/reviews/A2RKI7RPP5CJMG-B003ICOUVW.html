<meta name="summary" content="The Big Bad Wolf's Return"></head><body><p>As long as I can remember I have always been a fan of werewolf films.  From the good ("An American Werewolf in London") to the mediocre ("Silver Bullet") and from the funny ("Never Cry Werewolf") to the just plain bad ("Cursed"), I've seen just about every werewolf film that's been put out.  Of all of them, I've yet to see one come close to matching the greatness of 1941's "The Wolfman."<br /><br />Hoping to revive one of its legendary monsters, Universal offers up 2010's "The Wolfman," a remake loosely based on the 1941 Lon Chaney, Jr. classic.  It features Benicio del Toro as Lawrence Talbot, Sir Anthony Hopkins as Lawrence's father, Sir John Talbot, Emily Blunt as Gwen Conliffe, and Hugo Weaving as Scotland yard inspector Francis Aberline.<br /><br />While the basics of the original story are all there, such as Lawrence returning home to investigate his brother's violent death, the curse of the werewolf, frightened villagers, and a band of traveling gypsies, the rest of the tale varies greatly.<br /><br />In this version, Lawrence returns home with a damaged past.  After apparently witnessing his mother's suicide as a child, he is placed in an insane asylum for a year and then shipped off to America to live with relatives.  While acting in London, he decides to make a side trip home to find out what has happened to his brother who has gone missing.  When the grisly details are revealed, he starts looking for his brother's murderer.<br /><br />His investigation leads him to a group of gypsies where, unfortunately, he finds hiimself in the middle of a werewolf attack.  He survives the attack, but fans of the original know all too well what happens next.<br /><br />From here, he sets out to find the werewolf that has cursed him and also tries to find a cure.  Without revealing too much else, just know that Lawrence's story is changed quite a bit from the original film.<br /><br />While I liked many of the changes that were made to the original, I felt that director Joe Johnston fumbled the ball numerous times with these alterations.  Johnston added a bit of arthouse flavor to many of the transition scenes in the film, and spent a lot of time on flashbacks that, while not taking away from the basic plot of the film, didn't add much either.  Some of them were downright boring.<br /><br />The film was also very predictable.  From the beginning, I figured out who the real villain was and what would most likely happen.  While this did not ruin the film for me, it would have been nice if Johnston wouldn't have made the story so obvious right out of the gates.<br /><br />Johnston did get the atmosphere correct, initially giving the film a dark, gloomy and terrifying edge and then turning it into a desperate race for a man who hates and fears what he has become.<br /><br />Benicio del Toro does a pretty good job as Lawrence.  His performance is very subdued until his character starts to mentally unravel.  Sir Anthony Hopkins did a very good job as well, but I've seen him give much better performances in other films.  Emily Blunt delivers the goods each time we get to see her despite having a somewhat limited role.  The other primary player in this story, Aberline (Weaving), seems a bit over the top, but still fun to watch.<br /><br />The highlight of this film is the Wolfman himself.  Rick Baker's make-up is brilliant.  He updated the original make-up from Jack Pierce's 1941 creation, but kept all of the classic's primary appeal.  When you see the Wolfman on the screen, you know you're seeing the classic in all his glory.  When you look into the creature's eyes, you can see Lawrence Talbot begging for mercy underneath.<br /><br />The gore in the film is on scale with many modern zombie films.  The viewer gets to see human jaws impaled by werewolf claws, internal organs freed of their human confines, entrails and blood spattered all over the place and more than enough decapitations.<br /><br />Yes, there is some CGI in the film, particularly when the Wolfman takes to running and during transformations, but the creature itself is all make-up, hair and Benicio del Toro.<br /><br />Is the film great, not by a long shot.  It does have a few boring sequences and a bit of stiff acting, but overall it is well worth watching.  As of this writing, it is still in theaters.  If you haven't seen it in the theater yet, I highly recommend you do so if for no other reason than to see the big bad Wolfman fill up the screen and howl at the full moon in the background after rampaging through London.  It's one of the greatest shots I've viewed at the movies in a long time.<br /><br />For fans of werewolves, whether you'r idea of a werewolf is from "The Howling" or "Ginger Snaps," I highly recommend this film and  definitely recommend the 1941 classic.  Horror fans in general will also appreciate this film for its terror and "boo!" moments.  Action fans will also enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I plan on getting it when it is released on DVD.  If Universal plays their cards right, they'll release it on the night of a full moon.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

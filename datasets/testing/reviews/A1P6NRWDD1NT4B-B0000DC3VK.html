<meta name="summary" content="The League of Terrible Comic Book-To-Movie Adaptions."></head><body><p>One of those films where the inspiration was better than the execution.  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN has top-notch action, special effects, and overall production values. However, it doesn't gel.  TLOEG is based on a comic book miniseries by award winning novelist and comic book writer Alan Moore and it translates better in the comic book. Moore took homage to DC Comics' team books in which their stable of characters (i.e. Superman, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern. etc) are put into one comic book in titles such as JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA and JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA; the characters share in on one adventure each month in the comic book.  In TLOEG famous literary characters are put into one adventure to save the world  (Allan Quatermain, Mina Harker, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Grey, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde). The film however takes its style of direction from the Jerry Bruckheimer school of moviemaking which is loud, 'in-your-face', and chaotic.  The film is reminiscent of the recent film ARMAGEDDON.  Sean Connery is a presence in everything he does and fares quite well as Allan Quatermain, and the standout character here is definitely Captain Nemo played by Naseeruddin Shah.  Peta Wilson as Mina Harker is another in a long list of unneeded vampire characters that have been flooding the movie market these days.  The 'Hyde' character is a parody upon itself looking like THE INCREDIBLE HULK (HULK was created by Stan Lee to be a cross between Frankenstein and Mr. Hyde in the first place). Lastly, the plot twists involving some of the characters' motives  (i.e. 'M', Dorian Grey, and The Invisible Man)  were not surprising, inventive, or justified. They were suddenly turned into bad guys just so the 'good' characters would have someone to fight with.  Overall, another failure of translating a comic-book into film and had the film been successful, the ending was set up for a sequel...Its not going to happen.  Note: It was reported that Sean Connery had a choice to do this film or to do LORD OF THE RINGS.  He chose TLOEG because he understood the material for the film, but did not understand 'RINGS'.</p></body></html>

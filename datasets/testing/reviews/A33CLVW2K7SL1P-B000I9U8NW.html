Because there are so many, they have the extra burden of putting something original out there for us. I don't think this movie succeeded, unless you count a shot of Jessica Alba in her underwear, or Chris Evans running about for a few minutes with a jacket wrapped around his privates original.<br /><br />This is an "introductory" movie, and in that the superheroes need to change from ordinary people to "super people", and we need to see some of the angst that goes along with it. That takes time and grace. The problem here is that there were five people who were changed (including the villain), so that's five psyches that we need to get into. We're only allowed entry into one: Ben Grim. And the only reason he's upset is because he looks like, well, a "thing".<br /><br />We do get a glimpse at Johnny Storm, The Human Torch. He's deeeee-lighted by the changes, and a bit too happy-go-lucky.<br /><br />I was impressed by some of the minute attention to detail. In the comic strip, Dr. Doom is scarred by Mephisto's touch, and in his incredible vanity dons a mask to hide his scarred visage. We don't meet Mephisto here, but Doom is scarred, and he does pick up a mask to hide it.<br /><br />All-in-all, it's not a bad film. The special effects are decent, but we needed more reasons than we were given to root for the Fantastic Four, and more than we were given to root against Dr. Doom.</p></body></html>

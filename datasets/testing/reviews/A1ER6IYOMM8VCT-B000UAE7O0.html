<meta name="summary" content="INCREDIBLELY ENTERTAINING NONSENSE!"></head><body><p>If ever there was a "popcorn movie" this is it! A hybrid throwback to the days of cheap explotation films, this film is just too much! It's funny, it's tense, it's gory and it's stupid, but it's the most entertaining rocket ride I've been on in a long time! The film starts out with a mock trailer that's right out of the 70's it's totally hilarious! What makes the entire film even better it that it has scratches and wear throughout just like those old drive-in movies! If you love movies, you should check this one out....it's a blast!</p></body></html>

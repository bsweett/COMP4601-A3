<meta name="summary" content="ok, you want to know what's on this 4 disc collectors set?"></head><body><p>I did not make a mistake in my title, this is actually 4 (four) discs.<br /><br />This is a special edition of the trilogy released for region 4 and maybe 2 (Australia/Europe) so beware if you don't know anything about region coding, you may find this edition wont work on American/Canadian DVD players. (should be good on DVD roms tho)<br /><br />The first 3 discs are that of the trilogy, the discs are just the same filled with there bonus features ect...<br /><br />the 4th disc contains<br />- Audio recording of Bob Gale and Robert Zemckis Q&A (previously it was just subtitle text) - however this would be so much better as an audio commentary as it is nothing but sound, they could have at least put a slide show or something to this.<br />- Enhanced Conversation with Michael J.Fox<br />- Deleted scenes from the first 2 movies. Until recently in the new special release of BTTF, these scenes had not been released anywhere else. Scenes to note that where not on the original cut scenes are from BTTF 1 showing the full version of Doc showing his "permit" to the cop, and Marty questions if he will go back to 1985 gay. Also from BTTF 2 you find out that the old guy asking Marty to put some money on the Cubbies is actually Terry from 1955 who fixes Biff's car. As well as many other scenes that have additional audio commentary.<br /><br />- Production Design.<br />- Story Boarding.<br />- Designing the Delorean<br />- Time Travel<br />- The evolution of visual FX shots.<br />- Power Of Love (Huey Lewis) Music Video.<br />- Production Notes<br />- Making of BTTF 3<br />- Audio Recording Q&A for BTTF 3<br />- Designing Hill Valley<br />- Designing the campaign<br />- The secrets of the BTTF trilogy.<br />- FAQ's about the trilogy<br />- Production notes<br /><br />There are a lot of features on this disc that are not released for region 1. So if your a big enough fan, the 4th disc is well worth getting your hands on.</p></body></html>

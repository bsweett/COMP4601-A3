In UNSTOPPABLE Tony puts on the proverbial throttle from virtually the beginning of the film and doesn't even think about pulling it back; the result is nonstop mayhem, violence, and destruction that very much makes the film's $100 million budget not surprising.  Tony gets to tear up a lot of. . .stuff. . .in UNSTOPPABLE, a movie about a doofus who leaves his moving train to personally throw a switch--only the train gets away from him.  And speeds up; we're talking 70 mph speeds as it races through rural Pennsylvania on its way to a fictionalized metro (Stanton?), where certain derailment awaits--and of course the train is pulling several tankards of highly toxic chemicals.<br /><br />Yep.  That's why I took my heart pills as I was watching this puppy.<br /><br />While the railroad's execs dither on what to do another locomotive is in the area, operated by a crafty veteran engineer (Denzel Washington) and his wet-behind-the-ears conductor (Chris Pine).  When they're not snapping at one another Denzel's character is waxing philosophical while Pine's character is trying to smooth over a restraining order filed by his wife.  Ignoring the orders of the execs--who have decided to derail the train before it reaches the city--the rogue team pursues the train--in reverse--in an effort to connect to the runaway train's last car; then, they theorize, they'll put on the brakes to slow the runaway down.  Naturally, Scott really ratchets up the action here, and UNSTOPPABLE hurls like a rocket towards its climactic (yet sometimes cartoon-like) ending.  And Rosario Dawson looks darn good as a railroad operations supervisor, even though all she does is basically talk into a headset.  (Lucky headset.)  UNSTOPPABLE is an appropriate title, as it aptly identifies this film's thrills.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

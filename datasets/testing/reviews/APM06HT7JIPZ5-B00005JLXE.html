<meta name="summary" content="WAIT FOR THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!!!!"></head><body><p>I loved DAREDEVIL when I saw it in theaters.  Despite the severe miscasting of Jennifer Garner and Michael Clark Duncan, it was one of the better superhero movies I'd seen.  Ben Affleck is superb as the title character, and Colin Farrell hit the Bullseye (I know, that was terrible, forgive me) in what is clearly a field day for him.  Upon seeing it many times since, I realize that it's still a good movie, but in need of something . . . . . . . . . more.<br /><br />Bring on the Director's Cut!<br /><br />To be released this November, the D.C. of DAREDEVIL will definitely make it one of my favorite comic book movie adaptations.  One of the theatrical version's problems was that you could kind of tell that it was an R-rated movie trapped in the body of a PG-13 movie (similar to this summer's KING ARTHUR).  But rest assured, the DVD coming this November will be the R-rated cut, incorporating some twenty minutes of new material to make the movie just over two hours.  The DVD will have a new audio commentary track with the director among others, sport a DTS  soundtrack (sweeeeeeeeeet), and a feature entitled "The Making of a Director's Cut."  Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately, for those of you who already bought the first DVD edition) there will be no second disc with bonus features, but that's where the current DVD will still be handy.  Here's what I would (and plan to) do:  Throw away the first disc and the cover for the theatrical edition, and put the Director's Cut cover and disc in the 2-disc case.  Then you'll have the ultimate DAREDEVIL DVD!</p></body></html>

There's a major problem when the one involved in the most suspenseful action scenes is a kid, and not Mr. Bruce Willis.<br /><br />Willis is Jeff Talley, a former hostage negotiator, turned chief of police in a small California town.  He finds himself in a familiar situation when a home invasion and attempted robbery is botched, and becomes a homicide and hostage situation.  The involvement of an outside element, leads to Talley's wife and daughter being kidnapped as well, creating a second set of hostages.<br /><br />Things unravel when the home invaders turn on each other. As the high-tech mansion burns, Talley rescues the hostages, setting the stage for a slow-motion shootout with the remaining baddies, and a tearful family reunion.  Another unrealistic comic book finish.<br /><br />`Hostage' is flashy, but the lack of a credible plot and manipulative style may disappoint those that expect more.  French director Forent Siri's commentary for his first American film is rather flat and simplistic, focusing on character motivation with very little technical insight.</p></body></html>

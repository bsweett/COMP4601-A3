In some films it works: In KISS KISS BANG BANG the result is just a silly, self-absorbed 'in joke' that quickly wears out its welcome.<br /><br />Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, looking a bit long in the tooth) escapes his career in minor petty crime in New York and flees to Los Angeles where he serendipitously lands in an acting studio tryout and is picked up as a method actor for a part in a crime movie.  He is assigned to Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) who is to train him in matters detective, but instead ends up in a crime investigation that involves a lot of unfocused characters and corpses and Lockhart's old high school sweetheart Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan).  The plot is convoluted to say the least and it is made more annoying by the technique of voice over by Downey's character that flash forwards, static pauses, and flash backs in an amateurish way that begins as funny and rapidly becomes irritating.  The film seems to be a parody of the genre and as so often can happen in parody, unless it is sensitively written, it becomes too infatuated with itself to make us care about anyone or any event.<br /><br />Downey, Kilmer, and Monaghan give it their best and it is good to see Downey back on the screen: he is a gifted actor after all.  The saving grace of the film is thanks to cinematographer Michael Barrett who shows us a Los Angeles of spectacular beauty. But in the end Shane Blake shows us that trying to be ever so clever can result is a sort of a mess.  And if you can make it through this film and watch the Gag Role featurette, you'll see the reason the film got so off track: 'in jokes' that are so 'in' fail to be entertaining.

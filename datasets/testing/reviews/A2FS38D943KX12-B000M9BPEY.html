<meta name="summary" content="Fact is fiction, and fiction is fact; but how the story is told is what's important"></head><body><p>I did enjoy this movie quite a bit, and the tall tale sequences made me chuckle more than I normally would while watching a movie.  However, when I read the reviews which absolutely slaughter this film, I am inclined to agree with the criticisms.  As it approaches its climax, it too often slides into maudlin sentimentality.  It also leaves much to be desired when exploring the relationships of sons & fathers.  It is probably best not to try and seek deeper truths from this movie.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it is quite entertaining, by and large.  As Edward Bloom understood, the deeper truths of a story really pale in comparison with how good of a story it is in the first place.  For this reviewer at least, a really good story about a bunch of really good stories is justification for liking it.  My four-star rating comes with the qualification that at times, it promises to deliver more than it really can, and tries to be more than it really is, and stumbles as a result.  When it did become a bad thing to be a really good yarn?  Sometimes that really is enough.</p></body></html>

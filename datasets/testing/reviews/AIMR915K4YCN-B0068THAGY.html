Remember when his movies had charm, scares, AND excitement? Remember JAWS? E.T.? CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND? POLTERGEIST?? Well, SUPER 8 is probably as close to those glorious days as we'll ever get! Filled w/ great characters (especially the kids), a perfectly-realized 1970s town, and an alien connection, S8 delivers those wonderful goosebumps that I haven't felt since I was a kid myself! Director J.J. Abrams and Producer Spielberg have brought back the magic! Hell, I damn near cried! Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful, save the subplot"></head><body><p>"The Interpreter" is a fundamentally sound suspense thriller made unconscionably tedious by the imposition of a romantic subplot.  It looks great, sounds great, and when it sticks to the smart-thriller game plan it really works.  Scott Frank's wonderfully old-fashioned sensibilities and Steve Zaillian's epic tone are both evident in the screenplay which does a fine job of making global-historical issues tangible and compelling.  In the best sequences - the opening, the bus, and the high-stakes finale - Pollack's direction is typically strong and assured.  But when the Broome/Keller (Kidman/Penn) relationship strays unnecessarily from stressed-out, suspicious professionals to would-be lovers, you're inevitably reminded you're watching a movie which probably owes too much to nervous executives and low-scoring all-female test screenings.  The apparent willingness of Keller to contemplate bedding Broome when his own dead wife is barely cold is a character curve ball that adds nothing to the story but distaste.  Had the chemistry been left to the performances rather than corny, hamfisted dialogue or, better yet, had the relationship been restricted to the more interesting ground it ultimately regains - two inconsolable people helping each other through grief - then this would have been one of the 5-star movies of the year.  As it stands, "The Interpreter" ends up being one of those most frustrating cinematic experiences - a very good film that is nonetheless strangely disappointing.</p></body></html>

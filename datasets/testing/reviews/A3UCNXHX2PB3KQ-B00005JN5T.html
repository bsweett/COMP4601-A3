Streisand and Hoffman have great comedic talents, just ones that have not always been shown in the past. The cast is key to this, as they mesh well and that's what makes this a funny movie, along with a mildly funny script.<br /><br /> You really need to see the first in the 'Meet' series to understand the whole plot and all the humor in this one. The Fockers aren't quite your oridanary family, as Mrs. Focker is a senior sex therapist and Mr. Focker is, well, sort of a hippie. As the same couple from the original prepare for their wedding, the in-laws still haven't gotten to know each other. What follows is an always entertaining comedy that flows well and never really seems contrived or anything. Owen Wilson has a great character role, although brief. Even the pets are funny. I'm looking forward to buying the DVD this week, and at the very least, I think you should at least give it a try and check it out. 4.5/5, although more of a 5 than a 4.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best film in the series"></head><body><p>I have several friends who acted as if I had grown another head when I said that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was my favorite Star Trek film. Star Trek II had the epic battle between Khan and Kirk as well as the (supposed) death of Mr. Spock. Star Trek VI had a great whodunit mystery and the final sendoff of the original crew. Star Trek VIII: First Contact had the inspiring story of how the Next Generation crew saved postwar Earth from the Borg and thus helped humankind begin its idealistic journey towards the foundation of Starfleet. Star Trek IV, however, "just had a bunch of whales and a lot of dumb humor." They said that the latter quality was especially out of place since the original series was so serious in tone. And that's where I had them.<br /><br />True fans of the original series know that it had loads of humor. From Spock and Dr. McCoy's verbal battles to Kirk getting buried under tons of tribbles to Kirk and Spock's impersonation of old Chicago gangsters to the Enterprise crew's tangles with Harry Mudd, the series was rife with comic relief that made the characters all the more appealing. Even the most serious episodes had moments of humor. For example, in the classic City on the Edge of Forever, when Kirk and Spock travel back to New York City circa 1930, Kirk must try to explain Spock's appearance to a police officer. He explains that Spock is Chinese and that his ears are the result of getting his head caught in a rice picker. The scene is hilarious and works beautifully even within the very serious story line.<br /><br />That's why Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home works so well. It has an entertaining story that even non-Star Trek fans can enjoy. But it still remains faithful to the tone and character of the original show. Gene Roddenberry and crew brilliantly addressed problems in modern society through the use of science fiction. In this case, the crew of the Enterprise must counter 20th Century man's short sightedness by retrieving two humpback whales -- which are extinct in the 23rd Century -- so they can communicate with an alien probe that will destroy the Earth unless it can communicate with the whales. As Spock says, "To hunt a series to extinction is illogical." The audience can't help but agree.<br /><br />But Leonard Nimoy, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay, does not beat the audience over the head with the message. The previous two films were very heavy and serious in nature, so Nimoy opts for a light touch reminiscent of episodes like "The Trouble with Tribbles," "I, Mudd" and "A Piece of the Action" from the original series. Kirk and company must deal with hostile traffic in 1986 San Francisco, bus drivers demanding exact change, punk rockers with 40 decibel boom boxes, an ornery female marine biologist and other hazards of the 20th Century. After watching Spock's death, the Enterprise crew's mutiny against Starfleet, the death of Kirk's son and the destruction of the Enterprise, the jovial, humorous tone of this film is a welcome change.<br /><br />Naturally Star Trek fans will get the most out of the film. When Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard) and mother Amanda (Jane Wyatt) appear, a dedicated Trekker can't help but remember the great episode "Journey to Babel" where we learned of Spock's complicated and often hostile relationship with his father. And when we see the brand new Enterprise at the end of the film, only Star Trek fans can truly appreciate what a happy moment it is.<br /><br />But the fact that this film was the most commercially successful of the series -- over $100 million in 1986 -- shows that general audiences and not just Star Trek fans found the film entertaining and appealing. Roger Ebert, who was very lukewarm about most of the other entries in the series, raved about The Voyage Home. Star Trek fans have always seen the films as surrogate family reunions. The actors playing the characters may have aged and gained weight, but the fans loved seeing Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov return for another adventure. Star Trek IV, however, allows even non Trekkers to enjoy the reunion.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Young Frankenstein"></head><body><p>"Young Frankenstein" is a 1974 Mel Brooks film, based loosely on the Frankenstein book and horror films. It's got a good reputation, but I didn't know what to expect really. I liked it though.<br /><br />The "Young Frankenstein" is grandson of the original mad scientist, a professor of biology at an American university. He wants nothing to do with his grandfather's research, digging up bodies and bringing them to life, he thinks its a load of nonsense. On returning to his grandfather's castle in Transylvania, however, destiny compells him to take up the experiments again, and soon, he has re-animated a corpse, with the body of a giant man, and a brain belonging to an "Abbie Normal". That's what Eye-Gor (Marty Feldman) says, anyway. The townsfolk riot, the monster learns to dance, and a couple of love triangles develop.<br /><br />I think this film works best as a tribute to old horror films with comedic elements rather than a straight up comedy. It's got great sets (some from the original Frankenstein film), great lighting, and those long periods of silence and minimal score that older films have. I haven't seen as many of the old horror films as I would like to, but I have seen enough to think this makes a good stylistic tribute. If you go in expecting something funny to happen all the time, you may be a little disappointed. Funny things definitely do happen (like the monster singing "Putting on the Ritz", the police chief's strange, mechanical movements, etc), but if you treat the film like some forgotten horror flick with some unexpected quirks it works a lot better, I think. The uncoventional comments and such come off a lot stronger this way, and perhaps this was the intention. As a comedy tribute to old films, I think this is one of the better ones, and I'd be picking this up before, say, a film like "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra", which was made a couple of years back.<br /><br />Special features on the special edition include several deleted scenes, original theatrical and television trailers (narrated by Mel Brooks), outtakes, a commentary by Mel Brooks (whose audio sounds kind of aged), and a making of documentary with interviews from various crew members and Gene Wilder. He hasn't changed much, Gene, not really. They're all pretty interesting to watch.<br /><br />Worth a look for fans of Mel Brooks, and for lovers of the old time horror films. A funny tribute.</p></body></html>

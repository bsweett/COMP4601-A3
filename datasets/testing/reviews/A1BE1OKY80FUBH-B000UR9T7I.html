<meta name="summary" content="Not as bad"></head><body><p>After hearing and reading several reviews I was quite skeptical about this film.  After watching it, they actually helped me in being a bit more lenient on it and thus the three star rating.<br /><br />On the positive side are the special effects that are stunning (even more so on blu-ray) and the plot has some interesting twists that could have made the movie better than the two first ones.  For example the dark side of spiderman or the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend as they follow different paths in their careers.<br /><br />Alas that did not happen.  The plot remains swallow compared to what could have been.  Moreover the three villains are not well developed- especially Venom who could have been a great asset to the movie.  He has way to small part in a movie that evolves around super heroes and villains.  Sandman is a bit more developed and he could return if there is a Spiderman 4.<br /><br />All in all the movie is not that bad considering the special effects and costumes that are amazing.  Too bad that the plot did not explode to what it should have been.</p></body></html>

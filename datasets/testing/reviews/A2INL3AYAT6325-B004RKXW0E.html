<meta name="summary" content="Good 3rd film  NEEDS NEW MUSIC"></head><body><p>As of my posting this this is the biggest film of 2010 and the biggest animated film of all time.<br /><br />A good film.  NOT perfect.<br /><br />You do get the point of the film pushed at you enough about Andy grown up & the toys ending up at Sunnyside.<br /><br />They could NOT come up with new music.  We get AGAIN "You Got A Friend In Me" by Randy Newman.  We know Randy does the Pixar film music, BUT THE SAME SONG FROM THE 1ST FILM?<br /><br />We get introduced to a bunch new toy characters, only a hand full do we really get to see/know.  Quick line near the beginning of the film as to why some characters from the first two films did not return.  An easy bail.<br /><br />You may have heard you will tear up at the end.  Yes, you may.  They did carry the ending out a bit too long & as I said above you get the point all the toys have too much.  WE GET THE POINT, DO NOT NEED TO HEAR IT EVERY OTHER LINE.<br /><br />The Buzz reprogrammed old story line from the 2cd film.<br /><br />The beginning bit with the toys when Andy is still a kid was good.  One can always use a pink Vette.<br /><br />Normal extras on this 1 disc DVD, but nothing special.  NO CHAPTER SEARCH LIST.<br /><br />It is a good sequel, better than MOST 3rd films.  If you liked the first two films you will like this 1.<br /><br />And, when Batman gets to be Ken  & a James Bond in the film as well, worth a look.</p></body></html>

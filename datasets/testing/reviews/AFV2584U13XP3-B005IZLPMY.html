<meta name="summary" content="Nice Addition To The Other Marvel Line up But Nothing To Yell About"></head><body><p>While I do love that Marvel has finally after so many years of being the underdog in the 90's and mid 2000's to D.C. has gotten the attention they deserve,  but while this movie gives many people and longtime fans of the hero their overdue live action movie it doesn't go beyond a typical action summer flick.  The movie gives for the most part an accurate telling of the story of Steve Rogers from a lanky weak but courageous patriotic American wanting to fight the tyranny of the Third Reich and their villainous ideals but also adds another character for the future line up of the Avengers movie coming out next year.  While the action of the movie is pretty good I wasn't as entertained as much by it as I was with the action in the Iron Man movies or the Thor movie,  again while not bad the movie just feels with its storyline to even up with the Fantastic Four movies though with some better dialogue though and with a much more talented villain for Captain America(Hugo Weaving being a fantastic actor).  Still for what the movie is going for and for any fan of the Marvel universe here's a great deal regardless that no one should pass up...</p></body></html>

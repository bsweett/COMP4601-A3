The term "The Prestige" is a term in magic that refers to the third phase in an illusion. Not only does something magical and wonderful happen (not so in the case of Huidini) but when all goes well the audience should sit stunned and flabbergasted at what they have just seen... or didn't see. Christian Bale, as always - and I mean always (Empire of the Sun, Batman Returns la-de-da-etc...)- and Michael Caine manages again to pull of his wise charm. Hugh Jackman is dark and sinister, as is almost everything and everyone in the film, and achieves one of his better roles. And then there is Scarlett Johansen... She's blatantly underused, but this is after-all a story about two men and their rivaly, and there is little time to develop other characters.<br /><br />It is quite refreshing to see David Bowie in a non Labyrinthian role. He pulls rabbits out of many many hats. Movie plug. I am ashamed. He is quite the wizard, in a modern scientific way. Amazingly enough none of these men are quite as sinister as the unseen Thomas Alvis Edison, whose henchmen always seem to be on the heels of every electrical marvel that might infringe on the copywrite that he seems to have on EVERYTHING.<br /><br />I liked the Prestige a lot, and yes that's a friggin overused term, but I did. Poof.</p></body></html>

Too bad she isn't in as good a movie.<br /><br />Here she plays Brooke Meyers, a Chicago art dealer.  She meets Gary Grabowski (Vince Vaughn), a Chicago tour guide with a funny, spirited pitch for tourists.  They meet at a hallmark Chicago place, Wrigley Field, for a Cubs' game.  He sees her, falls in love, and tries to flirt with her, buying her a hot dog, while ignoring the fact she has a date.  She brushes off all his one liners, but in the next scene they're living together, so his persistence has paid off.  A scrapbook of scenes shows the highlights of their loving relationship.  Then, as we're up to date, it all rips apart.  The situation is not unlike 'The Honeymooners' with the subject matter of Bob Becker's popular play 'Defending the Caveman'.  The relatives of both lovers show how the house is divided.  Her family and friends are eccentric artists, and his are ruggedly, well..., Grabowskis.  For anyone from Chicago know, it's about tailgating, beer and brats, ball games, and wearing your condiments on your favorite sport's team T-shirts.  The differences are accentuated when he makes an analogy about Michaelangelo finishing his "Sixteenth Chapel".  After too much attention to the remote, she loses it, and after not being considerate about his slob space and den time for sports and heavy Nintendo games, he loses it.  And her.  Most of the movie shows how they try to win each other back.  The usual hand is played:  She dates other men to make him jealous; he invites the boys over, has wild women playing strip poker, and makes a lot of caveman noise.  They split the condo up like Fred and Wilma in 'The Flintstones'.  They're both hurt, but reconciliation isn't easy.<br /><br />In 'The Honeymooners' Ralph Cramdon was a riot--in both senses of the word.  When he built up to a crescendo, he delivered his funniest lines.  Here we get a lot of yelling, but it's only when the swearing and shouting dies down do we get any laughs.  Some of the best scenes are the tenderest, and here Jennifer Anniston shows some fine acting.  She totally knows her character and goes for a great range and depth of emotion.  Vince Vaughn as Gary delivers a multifaceted performance.  Hardly a cardboard caveman, we see a real person behind the boy with men's Nike's.  Movies are art, and art is meant to reflect and transcend real life.  It delivers gourmet pizza for the former; for the latter it  is comes off as stale and irritating.  Too bad it isn't billed as a documentary with laughs added.  As much as the story resembles a sit-com, it is given a cinematic treatment, however.  Developed from story ideas by Vaughn, himself, 'The Break Up' is much like another live-in-with-strife drama-comedy, 'About Last Night' from the mid-80's with Demi Moore and Rob Lowe.  Both even take place in the singles' scene of Chicago.  But while this rendition is well acted, it needs a fresher script and bigger laughs.  'The Break Up' may end up reminding people more of scenes from 'That Old Feeling'.  As a movie, it is realistic, but, as entertainment or enlightenment, it breaks up.  Many people suffering from damaged relationships may find solace in this movie, however.  For them it will be a hit--like a homerun made at Wrigley Field.</p></body></html>

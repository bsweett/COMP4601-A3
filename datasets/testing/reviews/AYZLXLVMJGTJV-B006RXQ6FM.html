I love Amy Adams and her sweetness in all the roles she takes on. I know this will be short. I think what I liked the most about the film, was how the pastor reached out to the little boy who felt so alone and seemingly hurt. Whether their was an agenda in play the kindness did feel tangible in Philip's acting.</p></body></html>

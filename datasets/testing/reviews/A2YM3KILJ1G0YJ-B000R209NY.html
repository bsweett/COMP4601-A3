It doesn't matter how much you spit shine the Titanic, however, it's still going down. Naturally, a tragedy is about to strike the ship.<br /><br />Evidently there are things called "rogue" waves, gigantic walls of water that come from nowhere and are impossible to predict. This "rogue" wave blasts the ship, flipping it on its side, and nearly capsizing the Poseidon. The buildup and explanation of what's happening is non-existent during this portion of the movie.<br /><br />Eventually, the ship turns upside-down, like a cup in the sink. What follows is a race to climb up through the bottom of the boat, an escape from the probability of a watery grave.<br /><br />The acting is neither the saving grace nor the downfall of the movie; it's simply adequate. There was fairly little character development, letting the viewer establish the character traits from the action on screen.<br /><br />Kurt Russell plays the tough guy, concerned father, expedition leader fairly well. He exudes strength and confidence while displaying highly uncommon heroism and sacrifice. He provides at least two genuine goose-bump scenes.<br /><br />Josh Lucas is the confident loner - who plays poker professionally - he's the brash risk taker desperate to exit, willing to risk it all.<br /><br />The rest of the escape crew fills in the cracks admirably, providing tension, excitement, and a helping hand in the escape.<br /><br />The added bonuses to this movie, of course, are that Leonardo DiCaprio is not a star, and an old lady doesn't mindlessly chuck a priceless diamond into the ocean at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is slightly anticlimactic, and somewhat unreal (who knew there was so much material on board of a ship that was incendiary), but it's a very good thrill ride nonetheless. The ending is what the viewer wants, and it's a worthwhile movie that had several exciting scenes, some stunning CGI, and enough action to enthrall.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A look at the American spirit in a time when it still existed."></head><body><p>I saw something tonight that I have only seen in glimpses throughout my life. I saw a man fighting for more than money, more than press clippings, more than the coveted one night stand with any number of lecherous groupies. I saw a man fight for PEOPLE and the diminishing hope they had left in mid-nineteen thirties America. He fought because he was told he could not win. The result is one where you alone will have to travel to see.<br /><br />This film does not possess even a hint of contrived emotionalism. Even Thomas Newman, the composer who's pulled at our hearts with scores like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, seems muffled a bit here, as if he too was in on the fact that you cannot add to the state of the human condition when its at its peak - as was the case with a boxer who tasted the darkness of life, but was patient enough to wait for the light. It is here where true life defeated synthetic emotionally-based fiction in the form of MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Unlike that highly rated film, Cinderella Man seems to scream, "Life CAN be great. You CAN overcome tragedy. To heck with this nihilism garbage! Don't hide away with your pie like Eastwood did in Million Dollar Baby! Raise your friggin fists and fight!"<br /><br />Well, that's what I heard as I watched this film. The voices belonged to those ever-diminishing elements like the American spirt, honor, hope, the indomitable will.  They are all here, in the form of one man and those who treated him like the light of hope itself - all when hope was needed the most. This is how stories were intended to be told. It's all the sweeter knowing this really happened, seemingly conquering Hollywood's current binge of nihilistic screenplay and shouting, "Hope still lives!"<br /><br />I highly recommend Cinderella Man to anyone.</p></body></html>

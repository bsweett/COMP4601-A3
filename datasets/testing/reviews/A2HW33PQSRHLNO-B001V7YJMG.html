For any fan of horror, the supernatural or experimental film this will be like a juicy orange with a little blood flowing out of the center.<br /><br />Based on John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BPIWIO">Let me In [Let the Right One In] [Hardcover</a>] about a 12 year old boy named Oskar (played with an understated melancholy by K?re Hedebrant) and his newfound "girlfriend" Eli (in a brilliant performance which makes you wonder how old the actress (Lina Leandersson) herself really is.  The opening shot of the film is a tide of glistening snow, pulsating in a black canopy night, setting the mood of the dark tale which paints a bleak portrait of human nature and the Darwinian world of pre-teen/early teen relations. (Another thing I admired about the movie is how honest it is about this stage of our lives.  People often portray relations between kids as being idyllic.  I don't remember it that way at all. While I don't remember anyone trying to drown me, it's not too far.)<br /><br />Oskar is constantly set upon by bullies and there are shots when the abuse he endures is viewed as Christlike.  The cinematography here is perfect.  His mother (Karin Bergquist) is of no help to the kid and his father is practically absent.<br />He is alone most of the time and his recreational activities consist of sticking knives into trees while pretending he is killing his enemies.<br /><br />Eli appears on the scene in a shot worthy of Bunuel.  Alone in the abandoned courtyard of Oskar's apartment courtyard she is fresh from another kill and looms over the child as either a potential predator or a friend.  Fortunately for the viewer, she chooses the latter.<br /><br />The bond that develops between the two is at first informal, cold, but slowly develops.  There is a child killer loose where Oskar lives and Eli's dubious relationship with him is never discovered by Eli.  After being captured it becomes apparent that the murderer is serving Eli.  The question the film leaves one with is thus: is it Eli's intent that Oskar fill this role?  Is his destiny going to be as ill fated as the killer?  Does she swoop down and save him from a near fatal incident of bullying because they are truly bound or because she needs another servant?<br /><br />Like anyone else I thought it was a bit much using 12 year olds for this kind of role. However, there is nothing here that is all that perverse, except for one single shot which I found absolutely unnecessary and gross.  The reason Alfredson uses kids for the role is not for any nasty reason (if you want an example of that check out some of Larry Clark's movies) but to allow the film a child's imagination.  Reminiscent of George Romero's film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33E6">Martin</a> this is one of the genius takes on the concept of the vampire.</p></body></html>

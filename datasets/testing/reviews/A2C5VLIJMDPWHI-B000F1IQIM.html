<meta name="summary" content="El Mariachi should've been dead at least five times"></head><body><p>I used to watch this movie all the time in high school, and I happened to catch it on cable yesterday and watched it again. As a kid, you don't realize how unrealistic this movie is but as an adult I was calculating how many times Antonio Banderas' character should've been dead. In a bar fight full of men with loaded guns (#1), strolling down the street with his back turned and a bad guy following him (#2), sitting on a bed while Salma Hayek's character Carolina sang (#3), the gun fight in the middle of the street with the bulletproof limousins (#4) and definitely walking into the gate of Joaquim de Almeida's character Bucho (#5). The way these guys were killing everybody else, they shouldn't have even had time to look at anybody's face. But as with almost every action film, the movie wouldn't be any fun if the main character who is the heroine got shot in the first scene.<br /><br />I absolutely enjoyed just looking at Antonio Banderas. My gawd, he's gorgeous. But eye candy can't always carry a movie because I thought "Takers" was full of good-looking guys and hated that movie. I can go down the list of movies with incredibly handsome men who I had absolutely no desire to see in an action flick but then go into average-looking guys who kept me engaged through the whole film. The secret to making an action film work for someone who is not an action film fan is style. Banderas has style. It's not that he's killing people. It's that he's so smooth with it. Not many people can glare at their enemies, storm down the street with bullets flying and look GREAT doing it. Even the knife guy was fun to watch.<br /><br />I'm not into blood baths and watching guys mop blood from a floor, but this was a Quentin Tarantino film with him as one of the leads so "What are you gonna do?" I don't think I'd have given this movie another glance if not for the actors who were chosen for these roles. The cast directors knew what they were doing. And I'd watch this totally unrealistic 1995 movie for another 16 years, too!</p></body></html>

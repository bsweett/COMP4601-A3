<meta name="summary" content="This Christmas Story is true to the heart."></head><body><p>I have seen hundreds of movies that move me, "It's a Wonderful Life" have been one of my favorite Christmas story as long as I can remember. Many people find it corny and old fashioned, I find it uplifting and as true in content today as the day it was made. No one could have portrayed the character of George Bailey like the unforgettable Jimmy Stewart....and Donna Reed and the entire cast.......Wow!!<br /><br />I think Frank Capra must have had a sixth sense when it came to knowing who would cast well with whom. I cannot count how many times I have viewed this movie, and every time I do it's as though it's the first time I have seen it.<br /><br />I am hard pressed to pick a favorite scene, but if I did I think it would be when the druggist, Mr. Gower, realizes that George did not deliver the capsules that contained poison, and hugs him. Without being asked, George tells him he will never tell a living soul......and does not.<br /><br />In closing, I would say there is probably not a person alive that could not benefit from the message in this movie. This is a true example of just how wonderful life is, and the final scene will help anyone who is sad or going through depression see that very well. A truly great film.</p></body></html>

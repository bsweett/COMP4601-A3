Loosely remade from the 1932 film of the same name, Al Pacino stars as the title character, a Cuban refugee who takes over a drug empire in 1980's Florida.  When first released in 1983, SCARFACE turned off many of it's viewers when they saw that (at that time) SCARFACE held the record for the use of the "f"-word.  The film that later took up the record, CASINO, is very similar to this film, in that they both center around a man with nothing who gets everything and then looses it because of his greed.  Brian De Palma's directing isn't exactly wonderful; Pacino's performance, however, is as the angered Tony Montana.  There's also an excellent score by Giorgio Moroder, and a nifty little 80's soundtrack.  SCARFACE may not be a masterpiece, but it's a cult classic and a true must-see for film fanatics.

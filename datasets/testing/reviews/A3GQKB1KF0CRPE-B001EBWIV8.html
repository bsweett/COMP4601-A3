I have watched it several times, thinking maybe it was the mood I was in, but nope.  Matrix was a mind-blowing one-trick-pony that just did not stretch into to a second movie well.  There are a lot of interesting scenes, but Neo aka up up and away, just brought a giggle out in me.  The LONG action sequences make you want to go okay, enough!  Less is More is NOT the banner of this movie! After Neo b**** slap's Elrond and his brother Elrond and his other brother Elrond 100 times it just redefines redundant.  Then Neo reaching in to pull out the magic bullet...oh, please...sigh...and the religious overtones are so pretensious.<p>It was good to see Anthony Zerbe a long under rated talent get a nice spot.  The effect are good, just overdone ad nauseoum.  Elrond take the ship to into the West quickly!</p></body></html>

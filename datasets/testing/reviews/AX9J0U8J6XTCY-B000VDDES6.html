<meta name="summary" content="silly, foolish, rowdy, and the best damn comedy of 2004!"></head><body><p>oh the joy, the outrageous laughter, the sheer fun to be had over and over with will ferrell's latest smash hit comedy! it was made to order for him, as well as the rest of the cast. ms. applegate really holds her own here as straightman to will ferrell's anchorman. the pandemonium that occurs from here on is non stop hilarity-sometimes a bit vulgar and crude, but oh the sheer fun you will have if you let loose a bit. the entire theatre screamed with glee thru out, as i did again with my new dvd. get it and have a real ball new years eve-right in your own home.</p></body></html>

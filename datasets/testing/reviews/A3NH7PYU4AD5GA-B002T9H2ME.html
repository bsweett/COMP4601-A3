<meta name="summary" content="Mutiny on the dark side of the Moon"></head><body><p>The product description calls this a cerebral sci-fi film. I couldn't come up with a better label. So, let it stand.<br /><br />Energy companies don't have it easy these days. Whatever goes wrong with their honest attempts at making a buck and solving the Earth's biggest problems will be thrown back at them through accusations and interrogations and committees.<br />Lunar Industries does something great: they are mining the backside of the moon for the fuel that provides clean energy on Earth: Helium 3. The station is run by one man and a robot: Sam Bell and Gerty. The latter has Kevin Spacey's voice. Sam has contracted for a 3 year term, which is nearly up. 3 years, he finds, was way way way too long. Sam thinks he is the boss and Gerty is programmed to help him. Quickly we smell a problem between the two: Gerty seems to be on the way to usurp power. Complications start when Sam has an accident on an outside mission...<br />The story really works better if you do not know it in advance, so I will not tell you more here.<br />You just have to believe me when I say that this is a superior sci-fi story. I will admit, though, that non-afficionados of the genre may find the going slow. I will also admit, following some comments, that the plot has its holes. Which sci-fi story doesn't require the suspension of disbelief here and there? (Upon second thought, I withdraw one star for this reason, thanks to the shrimp.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Ancient Art Of Puppetry Is Alive And Well In The Land Of The Dead!"></head><body><p>In this era of Hollywood Obsessed Computer Animation made by geeks  who could  never get a date in High School it is a true delight and wondrous  experience to watch this stop motion film made with puppets.Tim Burton weaves a simple tale about a guy named Victor in Not So Merrye Olde Englad who finds himself married to a corpse bride (although she still looks pretty to me).This movie is enhanced by Helena Bonham Carter's vocalizing which makes her character funny, sweet, vulnerable and sexy all at the same time. This movie gets beter every time I watch it and I continually find nuances such as the masterful play betweween light , darkness  and shadow which Mr. Burton excells at time and time again.This movie is low budget but has a stellar cast which includes Johnny Depp as Victor, Albert Finney, Richard E. Grant and Joanna Lumley plus the delightful (as always ) Jane Horrocks. The special features are also a "must see". Naturally 5 stars for this masterpiece of film making.</p></body></html>

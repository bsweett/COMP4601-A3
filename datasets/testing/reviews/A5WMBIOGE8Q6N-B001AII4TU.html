Fiona would not have been rescued and her curse lifted. Shrek has one day to change reality. Shrek must find Fiona and kiss her as a symbol of true love. Shrek finds Fiona, but she is a independent warrior woman delivering a sidekick to his face.<br /><br />The ogre scenery reminded me of scenes from "How to Train your Dragon". Fiona can fight blind, leads the clan of Ogres, and likes her space.  Fiona is a warrior princess type with a desire to overthrow the witch empire. Rumpelstiltskin has gain control of the kingdom and has the witches as his military.  The witches and the ogres contend with each other. Piggie pie, where the Witches patrol for Ogres.<br /><br />Shrek is a small Ogre compared to his follow clan members.  Shrek tells Fiona they were married and had children and he needs to kiss her.  Finally, Fiona kisses Shrek but the contract is not escaped. Shrek releases that Finoa does not love him.  Shrek begins to win Fiona over with his valor, insight, and caring.  In the end Fiona falls in love with Shrek and restores his life.  Rumpelstiltskin uses his secret weapon, the Piped Piper to entrap the Ogres.  Shrek surrenders himself to Rumpelstiltskin to get the "deal of a lifetime" - freeing the Ogres.  Both Fiona, part Ogre and Shrek remained chained.  Shrek and Fiona work together to defeat the dragon.  Fiona falls in love with Shrek.  A kiss. A roar! The rest is history.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Remake!!!"></head><body><p>This version is a lot funnier, and a great tribute to the classic 1974 film. I loved that they brought Burt Reynolds back to play former football player Nate Scarborough. Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a disgraced former football who shaved points in a big game. After stealing his girlfriend's car, he is sent to Allenville Penitentiary in Texas. Warden Hazen wants him to put together a football team. Crewe, Caretaker, and Scarborough train some inmates in a game against the crooked guards. I highly recommend THE LONGEST YARD!!!</p></body></html>

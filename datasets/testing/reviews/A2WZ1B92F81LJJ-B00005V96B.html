<meta name="summary" content="A riot for two-year olds of all ages"></head><body><p>If you have small children, movies such as this are worth their weight in gold: the kids love it (our two year old can barely start the day without at least seeing scare trainee Mr. Vile whose friends call him &quot;Phlegm&quot; and his ill-fated run through the bedroom simulation), and since the kids love it, you'd better get used to the idea of YOU watching it OVER AND OVER AGAIN.<br />And here Monsters, Inc. (along with the Toy Story movies and the outstanding Shrek) really shows its mettle: even for my (somewhat addled) parental brain, this film stands up to repeated scrutiny: I think I could probably recite the entire script verbatim and I still get a kick out of it. <p>Partly it's the characterisation - Goodman and Crystal are as good as you'd expect, but the secondary characters are their equal - the adolescent door shredders and, of course, Mr. Vile are amongst my favourites. Every aspect of the film rates highly: the script pops and fizzes (probably thanks to Crystal's ad-libbing), the computer rendering is brilliant (though I still say Shrek is the undisputed CGI heavyweight championship of the world), and the grand scheme of the film - its look and feel, is just remarkable. <p>Viewers who complain that the darker aspects of the story weren't adequately explored seem to have missed the fact that, first and foremost, this is a story for very small children. And besides, there's no way I'm marking down a film that guarantees me a half-hour lie-in on a Sunday morning just because it isn't nasty enough.<p>Two nitpicks (neither of which rob the film of the five stars it deserves): Firstly, the standard version I bought isn't the full widescreen version (this wasn't made clear on the tin, and even if it was, it is a curious and rather cynical decision on Disney's part), and secondly, to get the movie to play you have to scroll through a bunch of other Disney trailers - there seems to be no way to avoid these (other than impatiently cueing through them). This is standard Disney practice - although what they think it will achieve is beyond me, no matter what they do I'M NOT BUYING TARZAN - and it is irritating as hell.<p>But as soon as the family sees Mr. Vile hopping round the room frantically removing jacks from his arse, all is forgiven.</p></body></html>

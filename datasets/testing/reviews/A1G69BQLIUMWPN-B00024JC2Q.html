Yet, now that I own it and I watched it again I just didn't find it as funny.  I love Ben Stiller he is one of my favorite actors (Zoolander, Doodgeball, Duplex, etc.)  And even though everyone in the movie gives a great performance it is just not up to par with other movies each one of them have done in the past.  I get in the mood every so often to watch this movie...luckily I didn't spend too much money on this movie...so I feel I am okay if I watch it a few times.</p></body></html>

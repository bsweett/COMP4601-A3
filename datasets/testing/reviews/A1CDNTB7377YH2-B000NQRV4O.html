<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Foursome"></head><body><p>This is a movie that centers on 4 characters.  Jude Law meets Portman when she is struck by a car in a London Street.  Law accompanies her to the hospital and an immediate attraction leads to them going out with each other and living together. Portman tells Law that she was a stripper in the States but moved to London after a bad relationship.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Law becomes fascinated with Julia Roberts character, who is a lot older than Portman and a photographer.  When Portman arrives at Robert's studio to meet Law she can easily discern that Law is in love with Roberts.  In a poignent scene, Portman starts crying and Roberts photographs her.  That photograph will later be the centerpiece of Robert's exhibition.<br /><br />Law goes to an Internet chatroom and meets Clive Owens on-line.  Law pretends to be Robert's character and Owens thinks he has met a real sexually charged woman on line.  The two agree to meet at the aquarium the next day.  When Owens goes to the aquarium Julia Roberts just happens to be there.  Owens is sure that she is the one he chatted with and starts up a conversation with her that eventually lead to the two getting married.<br /><br />At Robert's public exhibition of her photos Law approaches her and the two start a secret love affair for about a year.  The movie continues to get stranger as Owens comes home from a business trip to confess to Roberts that he had an infidelity with a prostitute but Roberts is there to tell him she is breaking up with him to be with Law.<br /><br />The movie continues to get more strange and the rest of the film turns out to involve Owens getting psychological revenge on Law.  This is a movie that once you start you cannot leave until the end, even though some parts are hard to understand (the director seems to have time shifts that are not readily apparent until about 5 minutes into some scenes) and you expect Law and Owen to get violent with each other, which never happens.<br /><br />Both Roberts and Portman are extremely gorgeous in this movie; Portman makes a very convincing stripper while Roberts gives that 40ish great looking woman appearance.</p></body></html>

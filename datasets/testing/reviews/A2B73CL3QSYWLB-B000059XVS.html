I'll start my review by listing the strengths of this film.  David Lean was the last great director of historical epics.  He has all the elements in place here: great cinematography, editing, a fantastic score by Maurice Jarre.  Peter O'Toole's debut is nothing less than astonishing.  He does not so much star here as Lawrence but embodies the man, with all the contradictions and complexities.  There is a great supporting cast here with Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer.  But...this film is just so long.  I understand that what Lean is trying to convey here is that the unification of the Arab tribes against their Turk opressors was a long and deliberate process.  And we in the audience feel the long and deliberate process.  If Lean wants us to feel that the trek through the desert was arduous, well, he has succeeded.  My review of this film is not based on a single viewing of it.  I have seen it many times but getting through it is hard work.  In a nutshell, I admire this film but I don't particularly enjoy it.  On a final note, the first time I saw "Lawrence of Arabia" about 20 years ago at a repertory movie-house, about three-quarters of the way through it the theatre lights came on and the theatre manager came out and told the audience that they were missing the last two reels of the film.  Imagine my dismay after investing well over two hours of my time to this film and not knowing how it ended!!!  It's possible that initial exposure to this film colored my impression of it.</p></body></html>

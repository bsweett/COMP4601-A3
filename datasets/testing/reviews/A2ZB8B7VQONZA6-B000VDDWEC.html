This film is no were near being a zombie flick as the INFECTED are not dead they are just INFECTED with a virus that was put into monkeys. I don't know why people think of this as a zombie flick but what ever. This is indeed a great film and when it was released one of the scariest films in recent years. I remember seeing this and thinking man this is pretty intense as I was not expecting it. Still I found it to be a wonderful film experience and thought that it was deserving of the praise it was getting, most of the time movies are not.<br /><br />For those who have yet to see this for some reason it is about a man who wakes up 28 days after a virus has struck the UK and turned most of the population into raging killers. The virus which is called rage I guess makes a person go back to their animalistic instincts and want to survive and kill, nothing else. At first the guy has no idea what is going on until a few infected come his way but luckily for him a few other survivors are there to help out. These survivors are a tough bunch and are just out looking for food and supplies and have no problem leaving our lead behind. As time goes on a people get picked off a father and daughter come into the mix and the film turns into a road movie. They make their way across the country looking for salvation based on a radio signal they picked up.<br /><br />Writer Alex Garland did a great job with this movie taking a nice end of the world type idea and making it feel very fresh and very real. Director Danny Boyle did a great job converting the script and idea onto the screen. This film while not at least to me jump out of your seat scary it is still a very intense feeling film or at least it was when it came out. Acting wise one of my favorites ever Cillian Murphy is perfect for this film and did a marvelous job. Naomie Harris was excellent as well and did a great job as did Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns. Every one in this movie did a great job and I can't stress that enough, great movie I think.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun watching this when it first came out and still it is fun to watch right now, that's just me. Is this a perfect movie, that is up to you but I have a great time watching it. If you have not seen this then I highly recommend it to you, I say buy it and skip a rental. The look and style of this film is great and the road story that is involved in this is my favorite part of the film. The first part of the movie is the end of the world "we have to survive" which is defiantly the horror aspect of the film. Then we get the road flick that is the "we have hope now" part of the film which is the fun part of the film. Then we close it out with the dramatic thriller/suspense part of the movie when the army holds them captive. Could you ask for in a film, I think not.</p></body></html>

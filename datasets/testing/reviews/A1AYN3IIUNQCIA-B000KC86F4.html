<meta name="summary" content="not as good as the first two but still awesome"></head><body><p>ok, i first want to say that even before i went to see the movie i knew it wasen't going to be as good as the first two X-men movies but walking in i was fairly surprised. the film in my opinion, wasent half bad. Ratner actually gives his best film. i do agree that the plot should have been more developed and some of the story lines were ignored but from what Ratner did, he actually does a nice job. the world of the mutants is under attack again when a major pharmacutical company anounces a 'cure' for the mutant gene. supressing it perminantly. this causes a split in the mutant world, for some like Rouge it would mean living a normal life but for some it means that the humans want to snub out the mutants for good. and the one person who belives this is Magneto. gathering an army to storm the place were they make the cure and once again its up to Xavier, Wolverine, and the others to stop him. since this is supposidly the last in the series, there are many deaths and some of the characters are left open for spin-offs. all in all, not as good as the first two but still an enjoyable ride. i also loved that Kitty was given a bigger role then the first two. thats why i liked it a little bit more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beyond the Brink"></head><body><p>A turn of events can change a person's life in an instant.  That certainly is the case here.  A brutal attack finds Foster's character (Erica Bain) barely alive, and her fianc&eacute; not so fortunate.<br /><br />Bain finds herself struggling with a stranger within herself.  Unable to connect with the world she knew before her attack, Bain becomes her her own demon.  She finds herself once again in the wrong place at the wrong time, witness to a murder in a liquor store, and in this instance she is pushed beyond the brink.<br /><br />She lives for vengeance, and strangely on the wrong side of the law, out to right the wrongs of the world.<br /><br />Bain's only connection and comfort comes from the relationship that develops between her and Detective Mercer (an outstanding performance by Terrence Howard) who is out to catch the mystery vigilante.<br /><br />In the end, it is Mercer that hopefully has brought Bain back from the edge (didn't want to give too much away).<br /><br />Outstanding performances and gritty tension.  Well done.</p></body></html>

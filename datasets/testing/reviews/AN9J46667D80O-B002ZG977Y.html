<meta name="summary" content="Those whom gods destroy..."></head><body><p>I was a big fan of the 1981 movie Clash of the Titans. It had everything I loved: action, excitement, Greek mythology! It was a great film for its time and still holds up at least somewhat today. Sure, the effects have aged, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />It was also a movie that pushed me even more into my budding interest in Greek mythology; an interest which has continued to this very day. Heck, I got quite an interest in mythology in general and even took a course in it when I was in high school (and designed my own pantheon of gods for extra credit).<br /><br />So I went to the new version with a certain set of expectations. I wanted to see gods, Medusa, Calibos, the Kraken and some good ole fashioned swords and sandals combat. Anything further, like a good story line and decent acting, were to be considered nice bonuses.<br /><br />With those moderate exceptions in mind, this movie delivers quite well. Gods? Check. Medusa? Check. Calibos? The Kraken? Oh, definite check. Mind you, the gods are largely unnamed and don't do a lot, Medusa isn't as interesting as she was in the original film, Calibos goes by a different name in all but one sentence and the Kraken... well, actually still looks pretty impressively Kraken-esque.<br /><br />The plot is pretty basic: Queen Danae (a name never mentioned in the movie, which sucked cause I used to know a girl with that name), gives birth to Perseus, the son of Zeus. Her husband is a bit irked by this and dumps her and her son into the sea. They're recovered but Danae is already dead. Perseus is raised by the fisherman who found them. The boy grows up to be a man played by Sam Worthington who watches the gods kill his adopted family, sees Hades threaten Argos and eventually gets caught up in a war between the men and the gods.<br /><br />The plot is pretty basic, and frankly seems a bit more basic than it was in the original film. The presence of a Burges Meredith character is also sorely missed (though the owl, Bupo, puts in a brief appearance), as the replacement, Draco, handles Perseus' training a little too quickly to be satisfying. I also found Sam Worthington's performance to be less interesting than his performance in Avatar, and given how basic that was, that's saying something.<br /><br />The effects are all that you'd expect from a modern CGI-heavy film. I saw it in 2-D as there wasn't any reason not to. Everything looked good, nothing looked overly fake. The giant scorpions were impressive.<br /><br />Beyond that, the various characters were all essentially background dressing. Hades was somewhat interesting (though I could really do without him being portrayed as evil all the time. Hades was not evil), but not all that great. Zeus' armor was way too bright and looked very out of place for a Greek era, but the character himself was... well, somewhat interesting. None of the other gods even have speaking roles, beyond a couple words from Apollo, so there's really nothing there. All the Greeks except Draco and some mad guru who for all the world looks like he should be worshiping Krishna (he even has the third eye thing going on!), are pretty interchangeable.<br /><br />Also at the end there's a very blatant setup for a sequel which could actually be interesting. I'd love to see Perseus going off and encountering other Greek heroes (perhaps an Argonauts film?), or even heroes from other mythologies. Imagine would could be done with a film showing him facing off against Gilgamesh and Enkidu!<br /><br />I have a great sense that this film was originally supposed to be about a half-hour longer. There's several parts where it seems like there's scenes missing (how does Perseus get back out of the underworld?), and certain people who were clearly supposed to have speaking roles, like Alexander Siddig as Hermes, aren't really on screen at all. It has studio meddling all over it. I look forward to a director's cut that might restore some of these scenes and make for a better, more interesting film. What we have now isn't bad, but it could be so much, much better.<br /><br />Oh, and for all you Skins fans out there, let me tell you now so you won't sit there wondering all movie like I did: yes, that's Nicholas Hoult as Eusebios.</p></body></html>

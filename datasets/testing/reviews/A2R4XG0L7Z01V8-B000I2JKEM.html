<meta name="summary" content="An unexpected musical"></head><body><p>Before all the big films for Christmas come out (the new Harry Potter, the Narnia films, and of course, the sequel to Transporter 2 - yeh!), there's always a slow period, where there's not much on worth watching at the cinema. But because of a friend's birthday, we had to go see something, and we made the mistake of choosing Corpse Bride. I have to admit I like Johnny Depp, but he put on a posh accent in this, which wasn't cool. I've never seen Nightmare Before Christmas either.<br /><br />What I hated about this film, is how unrealistic the characters were. I hate this about animation. The heads are huge, the eyes are bulging, and then the body is unrealistic, and stick thin. The legs could have easily snapped by the slightest wind, and I just didn't like it. Why can't animators make this kinda stuff more realistic? What's the matter of making a character look realistic instead of stupid?<br /><br />The other thing I didn't like about this, was the fact was the characters burst into stupid songs (done by Danny Elfman) at the worst possible moment. I will admit I love stuff like Grease & Sound Of Music, but it seemed out of place during this.<br /><br />There was only a handful of people in the cinema seeing this, despite the fact we thought it would be mobbed due to the kids being off school. This has got quite good reviews, but I just don't see it I'm afraid. And as soon as I said to my boyfriend I was going to see this, he instantly said "awww, why?!" or something to that effect.<br /><br />I haven't seen a single bad review about this yet, and I fear I'm going to be the only one, and get lots of negative votes. (Bring them on!) Unless I can possibly get my boyfriend to do a negative review, just so I'm not too alone :( but he doesn't seem keen. Not that I'm recommending it that is!<br /><br />Tim boy, stick to having Johnny's lovely face in your films, and stop asking the mother of your child to actually audition for the film!!! (Helena Bonham Carter admitted that in an interview.) This film is not worth seeing.</p></body></html>

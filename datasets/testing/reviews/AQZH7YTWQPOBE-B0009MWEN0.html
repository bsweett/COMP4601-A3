<meta name="summary" content="Great satire/war movie"></head><body><p>Even after a decade and a half, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAFDP2">Starship Troopers</a> is still exciting and entertaining. The plot portrays a future in which a militarized planet earth is fighting against a race of alien bugs. Simple enough - and actually not unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXAE">Aliens</a>. For an action flick, the characters are surprisingly likable and really grow on you. However, what makes this movie worth watching even now is its element of satire. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAFDP2">Starship Troopers</a> parodies the senseless violence of war and the effect it has on society. The troops are all good looking (particularly Denise Richards!) and the officers are dressed like Nazis. Best of all, throughout the film, the narration employs a series of 1930s-style newsreels with propaganda clips and infomercials. It's a great study in contrasts. Of course, it's not really clear why they don't just rely on aerial bombardments and nukes (after all, the U.S. does) but I guess that wouldn't make for a good movie. Recommended.</p></body></html>

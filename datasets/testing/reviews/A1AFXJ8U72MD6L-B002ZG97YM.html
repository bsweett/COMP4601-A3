<meta name="summary" content="BETTER THAN I THOUGHT"></head><body><p>Based on a nine novel series by Cressida Cowell.  Focus is on a geeky viking boy who doesn't fit in with his rough and ready father's brute dudes.  Along the way of trying to prove himself he wounds and then later befriends one of the toughest of dragon types that eventually lets him ride it.  This is basically a well done tale of a boy and his "dog" with themes of acceptance at the forefront.  My nieces and nephews loved this one.  Adults should like it in varying degrees as well.  The ending, which was bittersweet, came as a surprise.  I didn't think they would push it that far but they did.  The twins are the best kid supporting characters.

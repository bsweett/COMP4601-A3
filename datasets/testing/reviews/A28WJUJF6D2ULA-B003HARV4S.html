With but a single seed he can instantly grow a mature tree; he possesses a magical looking glass which shows death within it; and most jarringly of all he seems to bring ghosts back to walk among---and accuse---the living. His demonstrations of talent catch the notice of the bullying heir to the Habsburg throne, who becomes obsessed with finding out how the deeds are done. He employs his all-purpose right-hand man to investigate Eisenheim and learn what he can. Meanwhile, this master illusionist recognizes the Prince's fianc&eacute;e as a girl he had once known in his boyhood, when he was then the son of a rural woodworker. Soon the master magician and the Prince's intended renew a love they'd felt in their youths, and a dangerous affair begins.<br /><br />The Illusionist has a satisfyingly dark feel to it. It is like watching a European art film, only done with an A-list Hollywood cast. The cobblestones and solid last-century scenery in Prague are perfect for this sort of tale, the lighting effects heighten the tension and the awesome-yet-understated on-stage demonstrations of magic Eisenheim performs are well-chosen to convey the atmosphere of the production. Also Paul Giamatti is so great in the part of the corrupt Crown Prince's not-yet-corrupted investigator that he readily becomes the film's star. Edward Norton, a generally superb actor, seems concealed in his role as the illusionist of the movie's title. By saying "concealed" it isn't that the role overwhelms him, it is more that he allows the role to be of greater essence than he as the contemporary actor, and I admire that. Also I'll note that Jessica Biel gives the most solid performance of her career as the love interest of both the stoical Eisenheim and the immoral Crown Prince Leopold.<br /><br />The Illusionist was a movie I enjoyed seeing unfold before me, even as I somehow lost interest in the plot, and was even annoyed by certain aspects of it. Despite the fact I liked this film and have nothing but praise for its visuals, there were some huge holes in it and there was a requirement that disbelief be suspended almost past the point of ready indulgence. I found it entirely ridiculous that a noblewoman engaged to marry the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire (among whose members politically-advantageous marriages were arranged in infancy, not adulthood) would firstly have the sort of freedom to go about unguarded that we were expected to accept that Biel's character Sophie von Teschen did, and secondly, we were further asked to believe that the death of a woman of her status would be nonchalantly verified by other than Imperial physicians, and that her state funeral would provide access for her body to be so deftly stolen. Was there no embalming, no lying in state, no grand service? Surely there would have been, and just as surely that would have made events as described impossible. Also in historical reality, though Crown Prince Leopold's death was attributed to suicide with a pistol, it was carried out with a woman, his lover, as part of a "romantic" death pact, and the Prince was not the ambitious would-be usurping reactionary The Illusionist portrayed him to be, so in the name of storytelling history is left behind without a flicker of remorse.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a fine film to see but it isn't air-tight and it doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. It's good for its scenery and some of its performances, and especially for its stage magic, but events could never have come to pass as the twist ending tells us they did.</p></body></html>

As a political thriller/ police procedural it hits many of the right notes. It shows us that there are good people and bad people in all cultural situations.<br /><br />The first two thirds of the film are quite good. A terrorist organization has attacked an American workers compound in Saudi Arabia and an elite FBI response team must get into the secretive country to find the criminals who planned the attack. The American team is led by Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) and includes a forensic expert (an underused Jennifer Garner); an intelligence expert (Jason Bateman) and an explosives expert(Chris Cooper). Once in country the team meets their Saudi counterparts  Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashrof Barhom) and Sergeant Haytham (Ali Suliman).<br />The two groups begin to build a relationship of trust that allows them to go after the terrorist leader and bomb maker, Abu Hamsa (Hezi Saddik).<br /><br />Perhaps the geatest flaw with the film is that its last third becomes nothing more than an extended gun battle that wraps things up too easily for my tastes. The film ends on a note that the violence will continue as both sides are entrenched in a kill them all attitude. As stated Berg does any things right in this film but it could have been much better.<br /><br />I viewed the HD disc that had excellent picture and sound. The special features included three deleted scenes in HD, an extended featurette on the car crash sequence, a detailed making of the film featurette, a timeline on events in the Middle East, and an excellent commentary by Berg.<br /><br />The Kingdom had the potential to be one of the best political thrillers of 2007 but unfortunately just missed its goal. The film is well worth a rental.</p></body></html>

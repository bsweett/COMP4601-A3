It's violent as one would expect so its for older teens & adults only. I'm glad Stallone returned to make this film (and Rocky Balboa). I'd definitely recommend this, especially if you're a fan already. I saw it in the theater and when I left I was saying how I have to buy this when it becomes available. Looking forward to seeing it on blu-ray!</p></body></html>

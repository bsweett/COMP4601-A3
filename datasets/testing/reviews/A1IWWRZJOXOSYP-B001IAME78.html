Louis Leterrier who was second unit director on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008AOVL">The Transporter</a> & promoted to director on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BTITKS">Transporter 2</a> took the helm and kept the pace moving as the special effects shine.<br /><br />The reason this film works so well is that Edward Norton is an amazing actor.  He adds reality and commitment to even the comic book world of the Hulk.  Norton has two Oscar nominations for "Primal Fear" in 1996 & "American History X" in 1998.  He was nominated as Best Actor by the Independent Spirit Awards for the lyrical and moving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOIX48">The Painted Veil</a>.  As Bruce, his calm demeanor is the perfect foil for the wild anger of the Hulk.<br /><br />Liv Tyler plays Betty Ross (sounds like Betsy Ross) who was in love with Bruce.  She carries her torch for him and serves as the damsel in distress.  Oscar winner William Hurt plays Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross, a military man who wears his patriotism with blinders on & places his own career interest above his daughter's love & respect.  Tim Roth does a great job as the loony Emil Blonsky who transforms into a bigger hulk.  Tim Blake Nelson was named Best Director for "O" by the Seattle International Film Festival.  In this film he plays Samuel Sterns, aka Mr. Blue, who is jazzed about the scientific possibilities that the Hulk's physiology contains.  Ty Burrell who was in "Black Hawk Down" has a strong appearance as Leonard, Betty's new beau who sticks up for her to her father, even after she's dropped everything to help Bruce.  Christina Cabot who was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AP0MW">The Maldonado Miracle</a> has a strong showing as Major Kathleen Sparr who stands up for what's right.  The DVD deleted scenes are interesting.  The Brazilian scenes immerse us in an exotic culture.  This is a film that is able to rivet us because of the excellent elements and Edward Norton's outstanding screen presence.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

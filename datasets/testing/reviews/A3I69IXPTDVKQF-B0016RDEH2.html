As the war between the garrison and the hill-based rebels rages, little Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is free during the calm periods to explore the dark woods, where she discovers a mysterious labyrinth....<br /><br />  The first thing that needs to be said is that the movie isn't as open-and-closed as its advertising makes it seem.  In the ads it talks about a little girl escaping into a world of her own imagination, to escape a brutal reality.  In my mind, it's not a given that what happens in the labyrinth and during other strange events, is just Ofelia's imagination.  Not to give anything away regarding the ending, but throughout "Pan's Labyrinth" you can find plenty of clues that would lead to either outcome - that it's an imagined world, or that it's really happening.  As for the events whose reality is in question, Ofelia discovers a Faun inside the labyrinth who tells her that she's really the daughter of the moon, and requests her assistance in certain tasks.  Accompanied by strange, insectoid-fairies, Ofelia returns to the more familiar human world, although at times she wonders if the Faun has revealed the full truth....<br /><br />  In that human world, the officer, Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez), rules the garrison, its soldiers, its staff of servants, the nearby village, and his own family (including his new child by Ofelia's mother) with an iron fist, and is absolutely ruthless in his pursuit of the rebels.  Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, the man behind "The Devil's Backbone", "Pan's Labyrinth" walks a lot of thematically similar territory to "Backbone" - innocents caught in a vicious world not of their own making, the desperation of the powerless against the powerful, and the strong connection of a child with a kind of otherworld.  The themes tie together intricately, and one of the tag lines to the movie - 'Innocence Has A Power Evil Can't Imagine' - gives a tantalizing hint to what may be going on inside some of the movie's mysteries.<br /><br />  On the techinal side, the movie is perfect - outstanding acting, special effects that are alternately beautiful and horrifying (including one of the most terrifying monsters in movie history), a great musical score, perfect suspense.  This is a must for fans of edgy fantasy, horror, and even war movies and intense dramas.  A++</p></body></html>

I loved the original ape<br />movies, but I thought this updated version was also very good!<br />The props were very good, the story was great, and I loved the<br />way it ended! Marky Mark was good too. I bought the dvd as soon<br />as it came out. This disc has great sound quality too!</p></body></html>

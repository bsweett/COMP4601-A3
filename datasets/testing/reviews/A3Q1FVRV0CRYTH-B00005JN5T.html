<meta name="summary" content="A funny sequel that's worth watching!"></head><body><p>Reuniting the same cast from `Meet the Parents' and brilliantly adding Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand to the mix as Greg's parents Bernie and Roz Focker, `Meet the Fockers' is saved from ruination.  Yes, as many have already mentioned, the plot truly follows the first film.  Jack (De Niro) is still weary of Greg (Stiller) and is trying to convince his daughter Pam (Polo) to steer clear of marrying him.  But this time around Greg has moral support in the form of his parents.<br /><br />As the complete opposites to Jack, both Roz and Bernie are loving parents who smother Greg with commendation and praise while Jack is quick to tear him down.  Dustin Hoffman steals the show from Robert De Niro this time, but De Niro still delivers none-the-less.  Streisand is fantastic as Roz and Blythe is still hilarious in her naivety.  Sadly, even with a sequel, Teri Polo fails to rise above the background.  Her character may not be as developed as the others but she still could have elevated her performance.  I read the other day that Naomi Watts lost this role to Teri Polo, and all I kept thinking was that after seeing what Naomi was able to do with her character in `I Heart Huckabees' that she would have been a much better choice for this film.<br /><br />Oh well, no use in complaining now.  So, it's not as original, but with De Niro still on board and Hoffman and Streisand recruited `Meet the Fockers' is still an enjoyable and hilarious ride...plus you get to see Robert De Niro breast feed a baby and that alone is priceless!</p></body></html>

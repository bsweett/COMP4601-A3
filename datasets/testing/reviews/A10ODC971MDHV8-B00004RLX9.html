<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"></head><body><p>After a sluggish, bloated first "Star Trek" movie, director Meyer steers the franchise back to more familiar and exciting territory with this entry. The gang's all here, and Shatner's particularly good as a more seasoned, philosophical Kirk. Montalban seems to enjoy playing the venomous Khan as much as we do watching him. Hit warp speed, and catch this lively, family-friendly science fiction adventure.</p></body></html>

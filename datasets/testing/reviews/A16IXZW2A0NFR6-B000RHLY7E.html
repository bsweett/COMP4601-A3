<meta name="summary" content="Rob Zombie Saves Horror From Braindead Teens"></head><body><p>Thank you Rob Zombie for this dirty make you want to take a shower afterwards horror film. This is one of the best horror movies in years. Far superior to House of 1000 Corpses which I thought ripped off 70's horror more than revived it. Rob Zombie succeeds here with his original intention. This film comes across as a fresh and horrible blast of pure wonderful trash right across the screen, majestic and raunchy at the same time, a film that will stand the test of time. Rob Zombie proved he is more than a novelty in the movie world and I am anxious to see what he does next.</p></body></html>

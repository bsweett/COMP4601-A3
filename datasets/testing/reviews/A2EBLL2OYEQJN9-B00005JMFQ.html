<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, intertwined narratives to be enjoyed on many different levels"></head><body><p>I was a bit apprehensive about watching a movie with a series of disjoined storylines, but Love Actually revealed itself to be a masterful film with storylines that interconnected on literal and metaphorical levels.  A viewer can't help but be sucked into these storylines, brilliant acted by the cast of Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Kiera Knightley, Rowan Atkinson in a delicious cameo, and others.<br /><br />The soundtrack beautifully integrated the different scenes of this movie.  An external sound-over (background music) from one scene would transition into sound-in (music playing in the scene) in the next segment.<br /><br />This movie explores all different types of love--fragile relationships, people that magically fell together, relationships being constructed piece by piece, unrequited love, glorious crushes, the pursuit of physical satisfaction, and more.  This is a testament to all the different forms of love, from the joyous to the mundane to the painful.</p></body></html>

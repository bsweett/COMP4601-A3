<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Thrillers"></head><body><p>I have liked Spike Lee's films over the years and found "Inside Man" to be a refreshing addition to his long list of excellent films.  Probably the last thing one would expect of Mr. Lee is that he would direct a thriller, but he has given us one of the best in recent memory.<br /><br />This is a film that keeps you on the edge; you are not sure where it is going to go next.  The battle of wits between Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) is like a chess game with each plotting strategy and sometimes finding they have been outwitted.  Both Washington and Owen are excellent in their roles and truly convince you that they are a detective and bank robber.  Jody Foster is also excellent as Madeline White, a kind of corporate enforcer who is hired to look after the interests of wealthy banker Arthur Chase (Christopher Plummer), who has something in a safe deposit box that needs to stay put.  Ms. Foster plays her roll coolly with the knowledge that she can convince anyone to do what she wants.  Her character clearly has either good political connections or enough dirt on people to get what she wants when she wants it.  She manages to twist the Mayor into letting her in to negotiate with Dalton Russell with him clearly being blackmailed into allowing it.<br /><br />Willem Dafoe is good as a police captain but does not have enough screen time to make an impression.  One wonders how much of his part made it into the final cut.  Christopher Plummer is also excellent in his characterization of Arthur Chase, who in old age is regretful of what he has done in his past but not about to repent.  I liked Mr. Plummer's final scene in the film where he is paying Jody Foster for her successfully keeping his name clean.  When she says more to his face than he likes it is interesting to see Plummer wanting to say something in return but keeping the words to himself.<br /><br />The screenplay is the first from Russell Gewirtz and is impressive in the way he always keeps us guessing what is coming next and not resolving the story until the last scene of the film.</p></body></html>

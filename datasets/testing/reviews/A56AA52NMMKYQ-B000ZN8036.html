<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful & intriguing, though ponderous ...."></head><body><p>Sean Penn offers a beautiful, though overly long and at times plodding adaptation of John Krakauer's best seller.  The story chronicles the westward odyssey of Chris McCandless, an over privileged suburban kid who is determined to live out a peripatetic bohemian existence and to somehow "find himself" in the rigors of nature.  The cinematography is beautiful.<br /><br />A series of vignettes offers mini-stories within the movie.  Chris as a farm hand. Living with vagabond hippies. Befriending an elderly widower who makes leather crafts.  (Hal Holbrooke is stunningly good in his role and, in my view, steals the movie.)<br /><br />What all of these encounters share in common is a pattern of McCandless engaging with other people but eventually stopping short of commitment, pulling away and forging on toward his Alaskan sojourn.<br /><br />A latter-day Thoreau and literary hermit, he meets his demise in an abandoned and isolated school bus in the backcountry wilderness. Perhaps McCandless should have spent more time burnishing his survival skills, training at NOLS or Outward Bound and spending less time reading "Dr. Zhivago."<br /><br />The movie offers interesting food for thought on how life's meaning is attained:<br />* Through books and learning<br />* Through conventional bourgeois pursuit of career, marriage and 2.5 children<br />* Through testing one's limits against nature in an isolated setting<br />* Through human connections and relationships<br /><br />McCandless is fixated on the "test manhood through nature" approach.  He dies an isolated, painful death, leaving a wake of heartbroken people behind him, not the least of which was his family, with whom he abruptly cut off communications.  In the end, Alexander Supertramp dies searching for the Truth.<br /><br />Did he find it?  Who knows.  The movie's closing only hints of this.  The candle that burns twice as bright lasts half as long.</p></body></html>

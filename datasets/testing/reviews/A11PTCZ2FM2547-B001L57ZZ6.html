<meta name="summary" content="Why??"></head><body><p>Hasn't the (Spoiler!) "Super Computer Gone Berserk" plot been hashed, and rehashed, enough?  Even more importantly:  Aren't Shia LaBeouf's 15 minutes officially over?  So, when you combine a leftover plot with LaBeouf's annoying ADD acting you get a wacky turkey like EAGLE EYE.  Is there lots of action?  Yes.  Are many of the special effects impressive?  Most certainly.  But--harkening back to the last presidential campaign--even if you put lipstick on a pig. . .<br /><br />A copier store nobody (LaBeouf) and a single mother (Michelle Monaghan, who's okay) are suddenly selected by Big Brother (only this time, it's Big Sister) to be dupes in the AI's grand (and absurd) scheme to save the nation.  Consequently, the two characters are forced to jump through death defying hoops along the way--all while receiving never-ending cell phone instructions.  They're chased by lots of folks, but primarily by an egotistical FBI agent (Billy Bob Thornton), who doesn't see the light until it's meeting him right between the eyeballs.  (Incidentally, Thornton looks embarrassed playing this role.  He should be.)  The story predictably builds to a climactic howler, then EAGLE EYE does what all bad films do.  It has a sappy, wannabe feel good ending.  And I felt good when I pressed the OFF button on my remote.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

A wonderfully entertaining thriller from director Christopher Nolan (MEMENTO), who proves he is a truly outstanding filmmaker.  Hillary Seitz provides the script; David Julyan composes the score; there's also some really great editing (Dody Dorn) here.  Pacino is terrific, although he's much changed since films like THE GODFATHER and SCARFACE; Robin Williams proves he's a master of acting with his first role as a villain; Hilary Swank is great as well, as the cop who returns Pacino's rest.  One of the best films of 2002, no doubt about it.</p></body></html>

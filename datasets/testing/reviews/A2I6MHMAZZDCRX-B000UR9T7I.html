He's finally dating the woman of his dreams, new Broadway star Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst).  He's doing very well at school.  And his alter ego, Spider-man, is the toast of New York City, much to the dismay of newspaperman J. Jonah Jamison (J. K. Simmons).<br /><br />The only downside to his life is former best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).  Harry has recently learned (or decided) that it was Peter who killed Mr. Osborn and has vowed revenge.<br /><br />Soon, that will be the least of Peter's worries.  The man truly responsible for killing his uncle Ben has just escaped from jail.  Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church) is on the run when he stumbles into a science experiment and gets molecularly turned into Sandman.  Meanwhile, Peter's plan to propose to Mary Jane falls apart and the two begin to drift.  And a mysterious substance has attached itself to Peter, tapping into his darker side and making him more powerful at the same time.  Will his new power and attitude destroy him?  Can he get revenge on a man who has no shape?<br /><br />Since I'm not a fan of the comic books, I can't comment on how the movie compares to the source material.  I can, however, complain about the change to the Uncle Ben storyline.  Those scenes in the original were what made Spider-man become Spider-man.  Suddenly, this revelation changes everything.  This doesn't sit well with me.  Couple that with the weak climax (I get why they had to do it thematically, but I still didn't like it), and you've got my complaints on the film.<br /><br />The rest of the film was wonderful.  The action scenes were amazing and had me on the edge of my seat.  The special effects made me believe everything I saw.  Yet the movie had plenty of emotional storylines.  They were perfectly balanced with the action and really made things even better.  For comic relief, there are Peter Parker's scenes under the influence of the virus.  And I loved Harry Osborn's arc in the film.  Even with all the different notes, the actors never missed a beat and made everything believable.<br /><br />If they just hadn't changed the details of Uncle Ben's death, I would have loved the film.  As it is, it is still entertaining.  A worthy pop corn flick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So Gritty And Real, Yet Still. . ."></head><body><p>Wow.  Does this epic, award-winning Western look and feel like the real deal.  It's gritty, rugged, brutal, dirty, inhumane--yet tender and poignant when it needs to be.  You can't beat Clint Eastwood as both actor and director; fellow cinematic heavyweights Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and Richard Harris give UNFORGIVEN plenty of star power.  And the story--a former bounty hunter coming out of retirement to avenge the disfigurement of a working girl--is as compelling as the day is long.  So what is it about UNFORGIVEN that so disappointed me, and continues to disappoint each time I pull up a chair to watch this very well-made film?<br /><br />Dichotomy.  It's a trait we all possess, to some degree.  It's certainly present with Hackman's character as Sheriff Little Bill Daggett--a dedicated public servant on the one hand and brutal thug and bully on the other.  That's a character contrast that's believable; we can see, and understand, both sides of the coin Little Bill represents.  But Eastwood's character presents a whole new set of problems (for me, anyway).  Bill Munny is a quiet, soft-spoken, gentle widower with two young children.  From his mannerisms it becomes evident he wouldn't harm a fly; he reluctantly agrees to accept the bounty because he's so desperately poor, but approaches the job with dread and despair.  As this film moves to its violent climax the viewer is treated to such a transformation of Bill Munny that I was unable to suspend disbelief.  The wild-eyed, almost evil incarnate killer Munny became was simply too much--even after he was so savagely provoked.  Thus I was aptly disappointed in UNFORGIVEN, a great visual epic with too much to digest.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Loved it...."></head><body><p>This is the third film adaptation of the series. Milla Jovoich (sexy girl) reprises her role as Alice; the film is directed by Russell Malchy. This time the plot focuses on Umbrella's failure to cover up its crimes and contain the virus it manufactured.  The virus then infects the entire United States as well as the majority of humanity.  It's up to Alice, one of Umbrella's former experiments to sort out the situation and put the living dead to rest in a world gone mad. Meanwhile an official of umbrella discusses plans to implement an antibody for the virus, hoping to give the zombies more intelligence/domesticate/keep them under control, Alice is the final ingredient to this plan. Alice joins with Claire Redfield and the members of stars and heads for what they hope is a safe haven in Alaska. Little do they know they are carrying an infected passenger with the lot of them.<br />The film if a bit gory, exciting, enjoyable and just long enough to get your fill of this type of genre movie.<br />One other thing about this movie in the series is that the special effects have improved tremendously and the acting was believable and fun to watch.<br />As video game to movie goes, this is one, if not the best I have viewed.  Doom sucked, so did Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, as did Street Fighter.  This was so good it was get another one added to the series-maybe next year??</p></body></html>

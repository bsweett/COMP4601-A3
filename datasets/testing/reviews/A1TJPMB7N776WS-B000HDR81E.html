<meta name="summary" content="2 1/2 Stars: Love Among The Ruins"></head><body><p>Vince Vaughn is quickly, successful film after another beginning with "Swingers," becoming a comedy icon. His work is very funny and inventive for the most part..."Wedding Crashers" for example. But, though he has some bright and crazy moments in "The Break Up" his humor is muted and along with the charming Jennifer Aniston he is asked to mostly bellow and wheeze through a poorly written script.<br /><br />The best Romantic comedies like the recent "Two Weeks Notice" (Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant) are smart, move quickly and feature funny second bananas. There is some heat between Aniston and Vaughn, the supporting cast is mostly good but after the first hour or so "The Break Up" falls apart and the situation between Vaughn's Gary and Aniston's Brooke degenerates into cruelty and not "The War of the Roses" intelligence-based, surrealistic cruelty but cruelty based on disrespect which is simply unpleasant to watch.</p></body></html>

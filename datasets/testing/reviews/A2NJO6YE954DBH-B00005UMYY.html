I was hooked on this film from the opening sequence and even though I was in the ballpark in terms of unraveling the puzzle, the ending surprised me.  The most important thing is that the ending fit.  The idea of a man trying to find the person who raped and murdered his wife is old enough, but the twist of making the protagonist devoid of short-term memory is utterly fascinating.  But what makes &quot;Memento&quot; great is what writer/director Christopher Nolan does with that clever idea.  Those who complain that the story is one of those post-&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; films that plays around with the time should just calm down and realize the story is simply being told in a regressive manner, with each scene taking us back for the next key piece in the puzzle.  Guy Pearce turns in an utterly convincing performance as Leonard Shelby, the man with a mission but no short-term memory, with Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, the woman who appears to be helping him, and Joe Pantoliano in a restrained performance as Teddy, who cannot be trusted according to the note Leonard has penned on the back of his polaroid.  The DVD version has a few select treats: Christopher Nolan is interviewed about both &quot;Memento&quot; and his previous film, &quot;Following&quot;; the short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan, which inspired the film and was written contemporaneously; background information about the characters and events you have to searh and find in the &quot;otnemem&quot; section.  If you have seen a better film noir than &quot;Memento,&quot; I bet it was in black and white...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slave to Fashion"></head><body><p>The rarified, oxygen-deprived world of "The Devil Wears Prada" is one in which very few people survive: blood sucking vampires, ravers, drug peddlers and those involved in the Fashion Industry.<br />Director David Frankel, heretofore most famous for the Woody-Allenish, Sarah Jessica Parker-starring "Miami Rhapsody," does a good job of setting the tone of entitlement and bulimia in his "The Devil Wears Prada" which stars a macho, gut crunching and proud to be a *itch Meryl Streep as fashion/lifestyle magazine editor Miranda Priestly and Anne Hathaway as Miranda's intelligent, not interested in fashion but needing a job/ gofer-slave Andy Sachs.<br />Andy, very much the innocent /stranger in a strange land arrives on Miranda's doorstep as a last resort after graduating from Northwestern University...turned down everywhere else she applies at "Runway Magazine" hoping to begin her career in Journalism. Andy is surprisingly (to herself and to us) hired as Miranda's second assistant: a job that everyone tells her "several 1000 girls would give their eye-teeth for."<br />Andy is subjected to a number of humiliating and challenging situations and by whit of her innate intelligence and talent manages to solve and/or survive all.<br />Streep plays Miranda as if her life depends on it: she is ferocious, haughty, smart and completely dedicated to her job and as Andy comments during the film: "If Miranda were a man, no one would make a comment about her drive for perfection." (paraphrase). There is one scene in which Miranda lets her hair down emotionally with Andy but the scene seems contrived to add another tone (a "female" one)to Miranda's character. Again the director should have left well enough alone, stuck by his character's basic nature and celebrated the strong, powerful woman that Miranda is.<br />If only "TDWP" as a whole had the steely resolve of Streep's Miranda we might have had an important as well as a mildly amusing film on our hands. But as it is, "The Devil Wears Prada" is a fun but ultimately shallow/missed the opportunity to make an important statement film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Brilliant & Classic Noir Favorite - Not To Be Missed!"></head><body><p>All film buffs should see Otto Preminger's "Laura" at least once. This complex, moody drama features the absolutely gorgeous Gene Tierney in the title role. The epitome of noir, many of the movie's scenes actually do take place on the proverbial dark and rainy night. "Laura" is much more than a murder mystery, however. It is also a psychological study of a controlled, analytical man who becomes obsessed with a dead woman. The superb acting, especially Clifton Webb's brilliant performance, fascinating characters, witty dialogue, Joseph LaShelle's Oscar-winning high contrast black and white cinematography, creative direction and taut storyline, make this an all time classic.<br /><br />Wealthy, beautiful New York socialite Laura Hunt is brutally murdered, killed in her own apartment by a shotgun blast aimed directly at her head. Hard boiled, street savvy Police Lieutenant Mark McPherson, (Dana Andrews), investigates the crime. (cool trench coat, too!). The more he learns about the deceased woman, and the longer he stares at her portrait, the more obsessed with her he becomes. Laura's story is told through flashbacks.<br /><br />The lovely lady had two main men in her life, whose effete, mean-spirited characters have always made me wonder about her lack of good taste. Waldo Lydecker (played masterfully by Clifton Webb), is a shallow, conceited, hypocritical intellectual snob, whose acid wit is a film highlight. He had a dinner date with Laura on the night she died, but she canceled. Lydecker, the young woman's mentor, had helped further her career tremendously and acted as her advisor on many occasions. He believes he was indispensable to Laura, who, unfortunately for him, fell in love with Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). Carpenter is a real philanderer, who is adverse to work of any kind, and readily admits it. The young woman's aunt, Ann Treadwell, (Judith Anderson), is yet another nasty neurotic, in love with Carpenter, and riddled with jealousy of her niece. The three are all suspects, but as McPherson says, in the line parodied by Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau, "I suspect everybody and nobody." When the no nonsense detective first spoke these words, however, there was no cause for laughter.<br /><br />I don't want to go into too much detail and spoil this great film for those who have yet to see it. Let it suffice to say that there are many surprising plot twists and turns, passion, blackmail, lots of suspense and superior performances here. And of course, the haunting song "Laura," a memorable piece by David Raksin is the theme.<br /><br />DVD extras include excellent biographies of Tierney and Price, two audio commentaries featuring film scholars, and a deleted scene. My highest recommendations!<br /><br />JANA</p></body></html>

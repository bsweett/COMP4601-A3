<meta name="summary" content="A celebration of America and an honest look at our folklore"></head><body><p>Open Range<p>There's just something about a good old-fashioned Western.  The standard formula never really gets old:  underdog good guys vs powerful landowner bad guys, a righteous cause, and a showdown on main street.  Add a dose of rugged individualism and a lovely lady to stir things up a bit, and you have the makings of a classic American story.<p>The things about Open Range that differ from past Westerns are in the silent details.  The first thing that impressed me was the stunning cinematography of our unspoiled American landscape.  I don't know if it's because of improved moviemaking technology or not, but OR just looks much more beautiful than any other film of its type.  Perhaps the location scouts have gotten more sophisticated in recent years - or more daring.  We are treated to some views of the West that depart from the traditional deserts, canyons and prairies;  raw mountainsides, green foothills, semi-forested valleys, etc. that were common sights back in the days of the cattle runs.  Another new aspect of OR is in the way the cowboys' everyday existence is portrayed in all its gritty hardness.  Little things like how they makeshifted shelters out in a downpour, the numbing cold at night, what tasks and drudgeries made up their in-between times, and the gruff camaraderie between them lends an intimate sense of the actual times and pace of life for cowhands back in the 1800s.  Life was at once a struggle and a precious thing, and we are not spared the starkness of it all in this movie.<p>While I'm mentioning departures from tradition, I'd like to congratulate the makers of this film for choosing some leads that don't fit the cookie-cutter 20 something image of most heroes and heroines.  Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner and Annette Bening play level-headed, mature people that have experienced enough of life to know how not to waste it.  Yes, there's a romantic subplot between Costner and Bening, neither of whom are any less sexy for being past their 30s.  Of course, Duvall is talilor-made for the role of the toughened, cynical older cowboy that has become Costner's mentor and best friend.  <p>There is some uneven pacing in this film that would put off some people who might be expecting the sort of action-packed rollercoaster rides that made up the last decade's few Western films.  See this film instead for its honesty and fascination with another century's way of life, and you will get some action as a bonus along the way.  And, if at all possible, see this movie on a very large screen for the maximum visual effect it has to offer.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

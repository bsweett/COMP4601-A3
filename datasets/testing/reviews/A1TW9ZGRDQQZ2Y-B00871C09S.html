<meta name="summary" content="Only My Second Hitchcock Film and It Was Great! Grace=Wow!"></head><body><p>I saw Psycho for the first time about two years ago and loved it, but I liked this one even better and that's saying something. James Stewart is wonderful in his confining part as an everyday man who just happens to be dating a Perfect 10 of a woman played by Grace Kelly. And as a number reviewers have already stated, her opening close-up shot is breathtaking. This is my first time seeing her in a film even though I have heard of her beauty many times and man is she amazing to look at! I am a guy in my twenties and have seen more than enough beautiful woman who bare it all these days on film, but Grace Kelly is a classic beauty that captivates me everytime she is on screen fully clothed and all. Sorry, I got a little off track thinking about her. I think almost everyone knows the plot and if you don't go rent or buy it today. I just purchased Vertigo and The Birds today, so let me end this review so I can relax while watching the master of his craft work his magic again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HALLOWEEN (2007) - Remake"></head><body><p>When I first heard about Rob Zombie writing and directing the remake to John Carpenter's HALL0WEEN, I immediately knew that the film was gonna be incredible. I am a major fan of Michael Myers and the entire HALLOWEEN series, so you ought to believe how excited I was to see this film when Rob Zombie had finished it. Little did I know that this remake was even more incredible than I had anticipated. I was expecting a great remake, and what I saw was not great; it was fu*BEEP*ing outstanding. Rob Zombie went into a completely different direction with his remake, a direction so different that this remake does the original film so much more justice.<br /><br />The film starts on Halloween, introducing MICHAEL MYERS (played by Daeg Faerch) , a troubled ten year old boy. In his room, Michael admires Elvis, a pet rat, while wearing a clown mask. Downstairs, his mother DEBORAH MYERS (played by Sherri Moon Zombie, Rob Zombie's sexy wife) argues with her crippled boyfriend RONNIE WHITE (played by William Forsythe) and Michael's sister JUDITH MYERS (played by Hannah R. Hall). Michael, in the bathroom washing a small bloody knife, is called downstairs by Judith. Ronnie berates him, teasing him for wearing masks all the time. Later at school, Michael is confronted by WESLEY RHODES (played by Daryl Sabara), a bully, and his friend. Wesley teases Michael, threatening to make copies of a newspaper advertisement for The Rabbit in Red, a strip club where Michael's mother works. A fight ensues and Deborah is called into the school to speak with DR. SAMUEL J. LOOMIS (played by Malcolm McDowell), a child psychologist. Loomis wants to evaluate Michael, after the school found a dead cat and numerous photographs of dead animals in Michael's backpack. Michael, overhearing the conversation, leaves the office and follows Wesley Rhodes into the woods. Donning his clown mask, Michael brutally beats the bully with a sturdy tree branch. While Wesley begs for mercy, Michael finds the advertisement in his coat pocket. He takes it before murdering Rhodes.<br /><br />At home, Ronnie and Michael are watching a movie on television as Deborah is about to leave for work. Before leaving, she tells Michael that every thing will be better soon. She leaves, and Judith is left to take Michael trick-or-treating. However, Judith's boyfriend STEVE shows up, canceling Michael's trick-or-treat plans. Ronnie falls asleep on the couch, leaving Steve and Judith to have sex in her room. Michael, again donning his clown mask, proceeds to duct tape Ronnie to the couch, where Michael then violently slits Ronnie's throat. Upstairs, Steve and Judith finish having sex, and he puts on the infamous William Shatner mask, wanting to have sex with the mask on. Judith refuses, and Steve goes downstairs to make some food. While in the kitchen, Michael sneaks up on Steve and bludgeons him with an aluminum baseball bat. With Judith asleep upstairs, Michael finds and puts on the white mask. He enters Judith's room, and places his hand on her leg. Mistaking him for Steve, Judith turns and questions the silent Michael, slapping him. He then stabs her in the stomach with a kitchen knife. As she stumbles through the halls of the house, Michael follows, stabbing her a total of seventeen times. He then enters the baby's room and takes her out to the porch. Deborah returns home from work, finding Michael and the baby on the porch. The police arrive, and Michael is taken into custody.<br /><br />Eleven months later, Michael is committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Loomis. In recorded therapy sessions with Loomis, Michael claims to not remember anything about killing. As Deborah has weekly visitation rights, Michael now creates and wears masks at all times. By Christmas, Loomis and Michael are screaming at each other. Eventually, Michael stops talking. During a visit, Deborah gives Michael a picture of him holding his baby sister. Moments later, as Loomis is about to walk Deborah to her car, Michael stabs an overseeing nurse in the throat with a fork. At the Myers home, Deborah is watching old home movies of Michael, crying. She then proceeds to commit suicide by shooting herself in the head.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, Loomis tells a 27-year-old MICHAEL MYERS (played by Tyler Mane), who hasn't said a word in 15 years, that he is no longer going to be his psychologist. That same night, Smith's Grove plans on transferring Michael to a maximum security prison. Before the asylum police can transfer him, Michael kills them, and eventually the majority of the Smith's Grove staff. He escapes, and runs into a truck driver named Big Joe Grizzley. Michael confronts him in the bathroom, and kills him, stealing his coveralls. Michael completes his journey by returning to his home. Under the floorboards, he finds the knife with which he murdered his family, and the white William Shatner mask, now tarnished and dirty.<br /><br />The story shifts to that of LAURIE STRODE (played by Scout Taylor-Compton). Laurie is living a happy life with her parents, CYNTHIA STRODE (played by Dee Wallace) and MASON STRODE (played by Pat Skipper). As she heads off to school, Laurie is met by TOMMY DOYLE (played by Skyler Gosondo), a boy she babysits. They pass the old Myers home, where Laurie must drop off an envelope for her father. Tommy warns her not to go near the house, as the boogeyman lives there. Laurie toys with Tommy, while Michael watches from inside the house. At school, Laurie and her best friends, ANNIE BRACKETT (played by Danielle Harris) and LYNDA van der KLOK (played by Kristina Klebe), make plans for Halloween night as Laurie notices Michael watching her from outside. Annie convinces Laurie to babysit for her that night, so Annie can meet with her boyfriend Paul. Meanwhile, Loomis arrives in Haddonfield to find the Myers's gravestone missing and the grave vandalized with a crucified animal carcass. On the way home from school, Laurie notices Michael again, and Lynda and Annie mock him. Annie is picked up by her father, LEE BRACKETT (played by Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky, the killer doll), the town sheriff, who offers Annie a ride home. Lynda also eventually leaves, and Laurie is followed home by Michael. That evening, Laurie leaves her home with Annie to babysit at Tommy's house. After they leave, Michael murders the Strode family. Michael then returns to his house, only to find Lynda and her boyfriend, BOB SIMMS (played by Mick Mennell), having sex. Bob leaves the living room to get more beer, and is met halfway back by Michael, who impales him to a wall with his knife. Michael puts a sheet over his head while wearing Bob's glasses. Lynda mistakes Michael for Bob, and as she turns around, Michael strangles her to death.<br /><br />At the Doyle house, Annie leaves Lindsey Wallace with Laurie and Tommy. Annie then returns home to be with her boyfriend PAUL (played by Max van Ville). While they have sex, Michael comes and murders Paul, while severely beating Annie. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brackett, convinced by Loomis that Michael is in Haddonfield, is searching the town in his patrol car. He tells Loomis that he responded to the 9-1-1 call for Deborah Myers's suicide. He found the young baby sister, but did not want her to grow up knowing what happened to her family. He took her to a foster home, where she was adopted by the Strode family.<br /><br />Laurie heads back to the Wallace home to take by Lindsey, when they two find the bodies of Paul and Annie. Paul is dead, hung from the ceiling rafters with a jack o' lantern on his head, while Annie is severely injured, but alive. Laurie tells Lindsey to go back to Tommy's house, while she calls 9-1-1. As Lindsey leaves, Michael, who was hiding behind the door, shuts it, and begins to chase Laurie. Laurie outruns Michael to the Doyle house, and she and the children look themselves in a room. As police officers arrive, Michael kills the officers, breaks into the bathroom and takes Laurie. Loomis and Brackett, responding to Laurie's 9-1-1 call, finally arrive at Lindsey's house to find Annie still alive on the floor. Loomis leaves, only to see Tommy and Lindsey, screaming in the street. They tell him where Michael went, and Loomis follows, armed with a .357 Magnum handgun.<br /><br />Laurie awakes in the Myers house, next to the gravestone of Judith Myers and the naked body of Lynda. Michael enters, placing his knife on the ground and taking off his mask. He kneels down and offers Laurie his picture of them as children. Laurie cries and tells him she doesn't understand, but then reaches for the knife and stabs Michael in the shoulder. Laurie slips away, but Michael corners her after she falls into a drained swimming pool. Loomis appears and shoots Michael three times. He falls, evidently dead. Loomis gets Laurie inside the police car, where Laurie asks, "Was that the boogeyman?" Loomis responds, "As a matter of fact, I do believe that was." Michael suddenly breaks through the window and grabs Laurie. Loomis chases after them, and tells Michael he was the one who failed by giving up on him. Michael lets Laurie go, and grabs Loomis, crushing his skull.<br /><br />Laurie hides inside the Myers house as Michael drags Loomis's body inside. Michael searches for Laurie, smashing the frail walls. Laurie grabs Loomis's gun, and hides in the attic. Michael then grabs a plank of wood, and begins bashing it through the ceiling. Laurie nearly escapes, but falls through the ceiling into a bedroom. Michael enters the room, and as she raises the gun, he charges at her sending both through the second story window to the ground below. Laurie comes to, lying on top of an unconscious Myers and attempts to shoot him, but the first few shots are empty. Michael recovers, grabbing Laurie's hand as she shoots again. The gun fires, hitting Michael in the head. Laurie, covered with blood, screams in terror as the film abruptly cuts to credits.<br /><br />  As I said before, Rob Zombie's remake of the 1978 Horror classic, is simply outstanding. I was expecting a great remake, but this outstanding was not what I had expected. Out of all the Horror movies that were remade in the last few years, this is the best out of them all.</p></body></html>

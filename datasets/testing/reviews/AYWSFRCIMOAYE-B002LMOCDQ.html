<meta name="summary" content="One of the BEST that my MONEY CAN GET 'cause:  Lovely & Dancing-Inspiring Music, Hilarious & Beautiful Scenes, Sing Along"></head><body><p>The GOOD<br /><br />- Wow! The music is lovely. It also inspires me to dance. It sounds exactly like the original played by ABBA.<br /><br />- The scenes are beautiful with the sea, mountain, beach, sunshine and houses on the mountain.<br /><br />- There are many hilarious scenes too. For instance, Meryl Streep was carried away while singing Mama Mia and fell through a hole. Another is where an older lady flirted with a younger, brown guy. One more is where multiple guys dancing on the pier with their diving fins.<br /><br />- Out of 18 songs in this movie, I love 13 of them. They are: Honey Honey, Money, Mama Mia, Chiquitita, Dancing Queen, Lay All Your Love on Me, Super Trouper, Vouler Vous, SOS, The Winner Takes It All, When All Is Said and Done, Take a Chance on Me, I Have a Dream.<br /><br />The NOT SO GOOD<br /><br />- Some of the songs are incomplete or interrupted with dialogues. This is really annoying because I need to listen to the whole song to completely enjoy it. For example, in the scene of Chiquitita song, the last sentence was omitted. It's replaced with the dialogues between Meryl Streep and her two girlfriends. The director should have the song completely sung before continuing with the actors' conversation.<br />Another is in the scene of Gimme Gimme song. It is broken into 3 pieces by the actors' conversation. That makes it much less enjoyable.<br /><br />- It does not have Karaoke version. That means there's no scene with only instrumental music. So, you have to sing along. You can't sing  Karaoke.<br /><br />- Of course, it's a musical film, so, please don't expect any logic and character development.<br /><br />Well, nothing is perfect. In short, every Karaoke fan or person who loves singing should have one copy. I'm singing along and dancing with this DVD once a week now. It's an excellent showcase of  timeless songs.</p></body></html>

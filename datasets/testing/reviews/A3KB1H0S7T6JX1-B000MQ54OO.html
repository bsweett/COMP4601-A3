In the Antarctic Emperor Penguin community, however, his dancing abilities are rather unappreciated.  His initial disappointment will soon turn to excitement when events make him discover a world he had no idea existed and his skills are put to good use...<br />Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Robin Williams, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs not to mention a few tears.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the MUSIC are all EXCELLENT!<br />In short, Happy Feet is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Antz, The Ant Bully, Cars, Flushed Away, Hoodwinked, Madagascar, Monsters Inc. and Over the Hedge.  4.5 Stars<br />PS If you are going to be using the Greek subtitles, simply...do not!  The translation is horrid with profanity that only an amateur (and with serious mental disabilities at that) would think of including in a primarily children's film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An All-time Favorite!"></head><body><p>I love this movie as much as Notting Hill and 4 Weddings and a Funeral. The different storylines keep you laughing and crying. Collin who goes to Wisconsin is absolutely hilarious and you cheer for what he encounters, though unrealistic! Sam, the son of Daniel (Liam Neeson) is fantastic, as is Emma Thompson. You feel her heartache. My favorite is probably Hugh Grant and his Natalie. What a gag she is with a 1000 watt smile. the 'porn' is done in total jest, and anyone who is offended needs to lighten up. It's much ado about nothing. Perfect to see with your honey. My guy even liked it.</p></body></html>

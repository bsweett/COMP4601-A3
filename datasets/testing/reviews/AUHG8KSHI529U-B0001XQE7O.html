<meta name="summary" content="A visually stunning movie with some good things to say"></head><body><p>While some find this movie strange, I found it quite touching.  Yes, it is about fathers and sons and families and the way they hold things together with stories of various kinds.  And yes, each of us has more in our lives than even those closest to us really know as they have more than we can ever know.<p>Is it a great movie?  I don't think so.  However, I think it is a very good movie.  It never does come down on the hard edge of what all of this really means in each of our lives.  The movie seems to think it is enough to wrestle a bit with the way lies, poetry and truth fit together.  Well, that really isn't enough for a great work of art.  I did enjoy the poetry of it all and visually the movie is breathtaking.  But in a way it is cold in the way a post card is colder and more impersonal than your own snapshot even though it is many times more beautiful than what you were able to produce.  <p>We really don't get into these people terribly deeply except in one extraordinary scene where Ed and Sandra Bloom (Albert Finney and Jessica Lange) are in the bathtub in their clothes.  It is an amazingly truthful and achingly touching scene with barely a word being said about what is being communicated between them.<p>Ewan McGregor does a fine job as the young Ed Bloom and Billy Crudup's portrayal of the son, Will Bloom, learning that reality isn't quite as cut and dried as he had always thought.  It was wonderful to see Robert Guillaume again.  He does a fine job as the family doctor and has an important scene teaching Will Bloom a bit about the difference between facts and truth.<p>There are many other fine performances and I don't want to come across as being down on the movie.  I liked it a lot.  I just think there was one more level the director could have taken the movie to make the movie important instead of just touching and at times quite funny.  But by all means, see it.</p></body></html>

The widescreen version originally had a problem with the last two movies, and I wouldn't get that until I knew for sure it was fixed.  Besides, since these are movies kids will appreciate most, the full screen versions tend to be what kids like (even though I always prefer widescreen).<br /><br />What I discovered is that my younger children did not know these movies.  I wondered if there being twenty years old would keep them from enjoying them.  I shouldn't have worried.  They enjoyed them immensely.  There were some cultural references that they did not get until I explained them (more from the 50s than the 80s), but that helped them gain some perspective on how culture changes over time.<br /><br />Unlike "The Lord of the Rings", this was never meant to be series of movies.  However, the huge global success of the first film led to the other two.  One evidence that a sequel was never planned is discussed in one of the extras.  It was pointed out that if they were setting up a sequel in the last scene of the first film, they would not have brought Marty's girlfriend in the car.  Having her there created tremendous problems in the second film, as you know if you have seen that film.<br /><br />The first film was inspired by the notion of a teenager discovering that his parents were once his age.  The time travel is the means to make that discover happen.  While the danger of changing the future is always there, it doesn't always have to be for the worse.  It sets up some very interesting notions about time travel, but it isn't really a movie about that or special effects.  It is about growing up in whatever time one lives and finding a deeper connection with one's parents and their lives.<br /><br />The second film begins in the future (building on the ending of the first film).  Because of something Marty was thinking about doing there and Biff acts on, the whole of history is changed again, and this time for the worse.  Doc Brown and Marty have to go back and prevent that change from occurring.  This leads to some very complex plotting because we have Marty's parents living their lives, Marty from the first film doing his thing, and now Marty from the second film coming back there to try and undo what Biff from the future has set in motion.  We learn from the extras about how hard these shots were to accomplish using the new Vistaglide from ILM.  Nowadays, it would be easy in digital, but unavailable in 1988.<br /><br />The third film was shot while the second film was in editing.  Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is the romantic lead in this film!  It is set in the old west.  At the end of the second film the flying time machine is struck by lightening and disappears.  Moments afterward a car drives up from Western Union delivering a letter they had on file for seventy years.  Brown explains to Marty that he is happy in the past and to not come for him, but tells him how he can get home to his time in 1985.  But Marty learns that Brown was murdered shortly after the letter was written and is determined to go back and get him.<br /><br />The problem is how to get from 1885 to 1995 without any gasoline to get the car up to 88 mph and how to get there before Doc is killed.  Do they make it?<br /><br />The extras are interesting and useful in understanding the making of the films.  There is commentary that you can listen to for all three films as well as short documentaries, some deleted scenes, and a few outtakes.<br /><br />Buying the movies as a trilogy this way is quite affordable and the extras make it an even better buy.<br /><br />Recommended!  However, beware that in the mid 1980s that most of the successful teen films were "R" rated, so the studios made sure there was some swearing (mostly the SH-word) to make it a bit more "mature".  It kind of sounds out of place today - which would likely have WORSE language.  These films are rated "PG" and that seems right.</p></body></html>

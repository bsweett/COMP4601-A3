Nacho aspires to be a famous wrestler, but he is unable to win a match.<br /><br />Nacho tries various things to get better at wrestling, but he always fails.  Through a stroke of luck, and the inspiration of a beautiful nun who wears red lipstick, Nacho is chosen to fight champion wrestler Ramses.  Can Nacho win the match to help provide for the orphans at the monastery?  Only viewers will know for sure.<br /><br />This movie alternates between dumb humor, dry humor, no humor, and a few very funny moments.  Much of the humor is very physical.  Most of the physical humor works nicely.  Some of the situational humor is very weak and often does not work.  But there are several moments in this movie where I laughed loudly and long.<br /><br />This movie is a relatively lightweight effort.  I suspect some people may be offended by how religion is portrayed in this movie.  Some people may find the physical humor, which is a pale shadow of that performed by the Three Stooges, to be somewhat weak.  However, there are enough laughs that this movie is worth a one-time watch.<br /><br />Good luck!</p></body></html>

They circulate in the world as if they knew no borders, no limits and they carry on their business without considering in any way the people, the interest of the world itself. They have their objectives and it is to dominate and manipulate the powerful in the world and eliminate them if by any chance they became rowdy or rebellious. This film is no exception in the genre. An ex-agent from a totally secret group of ? cleaners ? has survived the end of his group and is hunted by some other secret agents, from Russia actually, to cover up an old operation that failed. This ex-agent is challenged in his ? retirement ? and gets back on the road to find the truth he has mostly forgotten and to eliminate those who are menacing him and have killed his woman-friend, his love. He finds out that the failed operation had been under scrutiny by the CIA and that he has been trapped into another failed operation. But this second failure was planned by the boss of the CIA himself because the documents the CIA was on the point of buying would have revealed his implication in the first failure as the one who organized the stealing of twenty million dollars by a future Russian oil-tycoon. His interest as the CIA boss was to push Russia into wild capitalism to undermine the power of the Russian state, and as an individual it was the financial kickbacks he got from this newly born oil tycoon. The ex-agent manages to go up the trail and get to him and, finding out what was his role in the first failure, he is able to force him to confess, on tape, and to commit suicide. Then he only had to evade the Russian secret services who are backing the oil-tycoon. He eliminates the agent who was tracking him, he apologizes to the daughter of the two people he executed in the first failed operation and he disappears again to finally come back to the new head of the CIA, the woman who had re-opened his file to find the truth about the first failed operation, and force her to classify his file and reveal him his true identity that he had forgotten due to the multiple identities he had had in his spying life. This film is pure action, and yet it entertains the vision of a democratic state that is totalitarian through some secret agencies that are there to prevent any change in the balance of power in our countries and in the world. Thus there seems to be some Big Brother behind the decor of our government from the people, for the people and by the people. The people appears in this film as a mass of non-significant puppets unconsciously strutting in the streets and other public places totally unaware of what is going on in their backs. And yet there is an escape for the ex-agent, an escape that is purely selfish and unethical because it protects him but reinforces the secret agency with the end of the challenge to it that he represented. It is a Big Brother that is multiplied into absolute and totally untouchable immunity. Frightening and sickening. And if it were true ? Stephen King, when dealing with such an agency, goes right through to destroying it, like in Firestarter. That is more reassuring for us : this secret agency can be challenged and curbed into some legality. In this film none of these ethics. Total fatality and acceptance.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

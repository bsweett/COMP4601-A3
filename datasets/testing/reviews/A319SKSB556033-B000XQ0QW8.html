Bad to the point that my cousin my girlfriend and me almost walked out. Also it took quite while for anything to happen. But when it did it was kind of worth it. And being a comic book fan myself I appreciated it more than most.<p>I think it was a good idea for M. Night Shyamalan to film this movie in widescreen. As you probably know from my other reviews, I hate 1.85:1. The Sixth Sense was made this way and I found it very irritating. Also, this film was way better than Sixth Sense and I found the twist to be more wholesome and pleasing.<p>The kid who plays Willis' son looked uncannily like Haley Joel Osmet and Samuel L. Jackson made a BIG mistake with the afro. But his performance was still good. It's good to see that actors and directors take comic books seriously as authentic literature rather than classifying them as "geeky" things. For that I like the movie despite the abominable dialogue.<p>The DVD is in Dolby Digital/DTS 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 2.35:1.</p></body></html>

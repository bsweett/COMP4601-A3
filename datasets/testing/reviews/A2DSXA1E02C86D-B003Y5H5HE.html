After centering on a long-distance view of Montparnasse railway station, the lens zooms-in over the city's streets and rooftops, enters the station from the track side, swoops along a platform between two trains and among scurrying travelers, comes into the station's arrivals and departures hall, and finally comes to a stop in a close-up of a set of young eyes peering out from behind a large clock set high on the concourse wall. The alluring imagery of the film is immediate.<br /><br />Date stamped by one particular real event that takes place late in the plot, the year is no later than 1929, though an on-line summary of the movie places it in the early 1930s. Never mind, it's pretty much irrelevant to an appreciation of this bravura production.<br /><br />The story centers on the 12-year old orphan, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who, after a lifetime of familial misfortune, alone maintains the huge station's clocks while living inside the building's forgotten infrastructure. His presence has gone unsuspected by Station Inspector Gustav (Sacha Baron Cohen), a bitter and pitiless wounded war veteran who walks with the aid of a dodgy leg brace, and who dedicates his time-on-duty apprehending - with the aid of a big, black Doberman - parentless children wandering the great terminus and packing them off to an orphanage. Hugo's secret existence is precarious as he steals food from the Montparnasse's food vendors and tools and small gears from the owner (Ben Kingsley) of a toy repair booth located within the station. Young Cabret uses the stolen items from the repair shop to attempt to fix a non-functioning automaton from his deceased father's former clock shop. Once again operable, Hugo hopes the mechanical figure will do ... well, something ... that may somehow prove to be a message from his Dear But Dead Ol' Dad.<br /><br />HUGO is Martin Scorcese's tribute to the ground-breaking French illusionist-turned-film maker Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s who, between 1896 and 1913, directed - and often stared in - some 531 short (1-40 minute) silent films, most of which have since been lost. Georges himself, I suspect, is virtually unknown by most of the public except a knowledgeable few in the film industry, though any one may have seen, at some point in life, a scene from his film "Le Voyage dans la Lune" ("A Trip to the Moon"), that of a canon-fired spaceship hitting a humanized Moon in the right eye.<br /><br />The visual presentation of HUGO is positively magical, especially as rendered in the 3-D format. Unusual camera perspectives linger lovingly on moving gears and machine parts, clock pendulums, abandoned labyrinthine spaces (within the Montparnasse infrastructure), as well as the chaotic and crowded ambiance of the station's public areas.<br /><br />Students of film will appreciate the significant inclusion of rescued, archival footage from M&eacute;li&egrave;s's silents.<br /><br />HUGO was the first of a cinematic doubleheader attended by my wife and I on Christmas Day, the second being the latest Mission Improbable episode, GHOST PROTOCOL. As gripping an action film as the latter is, I wouldn't bother to attend it again or review it. HUGO, however, I would see once more (at least) just for the utter delight it brought me - that same delight a child experiences on first gazing upon a fireworks display, or first holding a puppy, or perhaps first eating an ice cream. A delight that comes less often as we age. It's the purest reason for seeing any moving picture show, and the reason for their making that M&eacute;li&egrave;s understood and Scorcese understands.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Cash was sure one unique individual."></head><body><p>This past weekend I was able to watch this film and Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn't doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don't rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.<br /><br />And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clich&eacute;d bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own "character", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John.<br /><br />The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have to admit they generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. Rarely I feel that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.<br /><br />This film far exceeded my expectations and with a true feeling of satisfaction.</p></body></html>

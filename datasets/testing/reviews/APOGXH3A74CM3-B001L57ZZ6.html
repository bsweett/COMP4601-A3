That being said, when this came on cable, out of curiosity I thought I'd watch a few minutes to see if it was going to be as bad as I imagined.  It wasn't.  I watched the whole thing and enjoyed it.<br /><br />Sure, the story is loosely stitched together and barely plausible, but it works well enough to keep the non-stop action moving at breakneck speed. The fast pace of this film left little time to think about how silly and unrealistic the plot was at times.<br /><br />I'd definitely watch this again.</p></body></html>

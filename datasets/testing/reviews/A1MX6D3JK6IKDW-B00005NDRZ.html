<meta name="summary" content="THE SNOWS OF KILLER-MAJARO?"></head><body><p>To be honest, when I first viewed this film in the early eighties, I thought that Stanley Kubrick had completely ruined Stephen King's best novel. But, now that i'm able to mentally segregate the film from the book, this is a classic horror film with a terrific DVD transfer that I saw last night. As for the movie, simply take a recovering alcoholic prone to visions and flashbacks (Nicholson), pair him with a son who's got many problems himself despite psychiatric reassurances(Lloyd) and bundle this up with a sane mother who looks insane(Duvall))and you've got all the ingredients for a winning tri-fecta at sea level. Add a secluded mountaintop hotel with a notorious past  that this trio will inhabit alone for the next six months, and you have all that you really need to know. Now, go buy a perfect stocking stuffer for the "King" residing in you.</p></body></html>

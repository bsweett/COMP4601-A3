<meta name="summary" content="The Fountain"></head><body><p>In the 1500s, Queen Isabel (Weisz) of Spain sends a Conquistador (Jackman) to find the Fountain of Youth in New Spain.  In the 26th century, a man (Jackman) is on a trip through the stars with a tree.  In the present, Tommy Creo (Jackman), a drug developer, is trying to cure his wife Izzy (Weisz), who has an inoperable brain tumor.<br /><br />While this is a vague description, to tell more would be to give away too much.  All the story lines are related in some way, and director Darren Aronofsky does a good job bouncing back and forth between the three.  Jackman and Weisz are the emotional core of the movie, and both do very good jobs in their multiple roles.  At its heart, "The Fountain" is a love story, albeit not a love story for everyone.  It is worth a view if you are looking for something a little different.</p></body></html>

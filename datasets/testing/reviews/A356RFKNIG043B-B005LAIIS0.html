<meta name="summary" content="Neeson is excellent in this grim survival drama"></head><body><p>I'm truly surprised to see so many bad reviews of this here. I for one was surprised by how solid it was, specifically because of Neeson's typically excellent performance. In fact, it's one of his best roles. Add that to a great score and tight direction and this is a chilling tale in every way.<br /><br />It's tough not to give spoilers for this one, so, short and sweet: it's occasionally very violent but it's always real violence, mostly wolf on man, and I'll take that any day over the numbing one hero shoots a hundred bad guys crap we usually get. This is much scarier, as it's believable. And it felt all too real at many moments, and that ever-present threat of (all-natural!) carnage adds a lot of suspense.<br /><br />The Grey has two classic scenes to boot: one of the best/worst plane crashes on film, and a truly fine death scene that transcends almost all other cinematic deaths. Perhaps it's those two scenes that turned folks off: they make us face a couple of very common fears, but not in an exploitative, fake way. That makes them all the more real and edgy.<br /><br />Neeson makes them work, as he does the whole film. The guy can act, and never does he feel like he's in a film. He carries it all, and this is one of the best acting jobs I've ever seen in a film like this. It starts out as man vs. man, then man vs nature, and finally it's man vs. himself. That's all of the dramatic basics wrapped up in one, and it works.<br /><br />The blu-ray is a good transfer, but features only deleted scenes, all rightfully so, and a commentary. BUT...the commentary features the director and two editors drinking scotch throughout, and as they get sauced they start getting more honest, which you almost never hear on these. Carnahan even goes so far as to say that he thinks the film didn't deserve to have been a box office number one, which is a wild thing to say about your own film. But the commentary is well worth checking out for just such moments; it's one of a kind. (I sure would love to have heard Hitchcock or Kurosawa discussing their films while knocking back a few!)<br /><br />All in all, if you like a good raw survival film, then this is your meat. So to speak...</p></body></html>

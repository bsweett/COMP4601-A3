<meta name="summary" content="A Worthy Last Fight For Rocky!"></head><body><p>Sylvester Stallone is back for the 6th time as Rocky Balboa. Yes he's old which had many people including myself making fun of the fact that he was doing another. Yet Stallone manages to pull it off anyway. It's about him trying to prove that he's a somebody yet again. Since spectators try to say he was over-rated and that a famous boxer of today would destroy him. A computer fight shows that Rocky would win but not many people actually agree with it. The movie isn't all about the fight though. It's about Rocky trying to move on after the death of his beloved wife Adrian and trying to get back into the life of his son. It's also about as smart as the first one.<br /><br />  I always have found myself thinking about the girl he gave advice about not smoking in part 1. She's even back in this one and Rocky is looking out for her once again. The movie could've easily have given us a romance between the two but Stallone's script is smart enough to know that Rocky could probably never get with another woman after Adrian. So they just have a little innocent flirtation thing going on.<br /><br />  The movie is good but I don't think there's even any mention of the fact that he had a serious concussion after his fight in part 4. Which is why he was even retired in the first place since another fight would've risked brain damage. But who cares really since it's nice to see Stallone and Burt Young on screen together one last time anyway. The film wasn't needed that much but still it's a respectful reunion with Stallone giving his best performance in awhile. Rocky doesn't only make a great comeback but so does Stallone since before this he has been making made for dvd movies for a few years now. I think he's going a little too far by making a Rambo 4 though...lol. But who knows, if he could pull off a good Rocky film at his age then maybe he can even pull off a Rambo 4.</p></body></html>

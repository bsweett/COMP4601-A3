A section of city bordered by rivers has been walled off from the hungry corpses.  But in this haven there is a vast class distinction with the upper crust living in the towering Fiddler's Green while the rest are in squalor.  [...]  With the survival of the living hanging in the balance and power slipping into the wrong hands the story really works.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed Dawn of the Dead, you will probably like this one.  The gore factor is high but not as blatant as in some movies of this ilk.  It is an odd movie because you find yourself wanting the thinking zombie to continue to solve problems.  I don't know if it is because it means that death and zombiedom might not be final or what, but it is a strange feeling.  Good acting by the cast also helps the movie succeed.  All in all I had a fun time watching it and was surprised at how good it was.</p></body></html>

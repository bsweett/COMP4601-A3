<meta name="summary" content="COLLATERAL DAMAGE"></head><body><p>Michael Mann's direction is solid and intriguing in this unusual crime thriller.  His 80s' MTV style resonates even in this new millenium, and he manages to combine his trademark action elements with satisfying performances from his two leads.  First of all, though, I have to comment on Jamie Foxx's performance.  In his Oscar winning portrayal of Ray Charles, Foxx WAS Ray Charles, and one had a hard time believing he was acting.  In COLLATERAL, he is obviously acting; his nuances and mannerisms are trademark acting---good and solid, but his nomination for supporting actor leaves me wondering if this performance deserved that accolade, particularly in light of his shooin for Best Actor.  Certainly there were other actors out there (Liev Schrieber in Manchurian Candidate; Alfred Molina in Spiderman 2, for example) who should have had Foxx's spot in the supporting category.  Anyway, while Jamie does well in this role, I found myself more mesmerized with Tom Cruise.  As a legitimate superstar, Cruise has not taken the comfortable route by doing roles that appeal to his audience or do not challenge him.  In COLLATERAL, he takes the risk of being an extremely cold, unlikeable killer, with no redeeming qualities.  His hair sleek and silver, behind those Raybans, Cruise oozes menace and is one of his most interesting performances.  His physical dexterity, his cold steely glare intensify his performance, and it's to his credit that he shares so much of the movie with Foxx.  COLLATERAL ultimately is a twisted "buddy movie," although the bonding is definitely not one of choice but of necessity.  I had a hard time believing a cabbie could change so quickly and outsmart a suave professional hit man, but cinematic rules dictated this heroic twist.  Jada Pinkett Smith is cool in a small but pivotal role; Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg and Bruce McGill offer solid support in standard roles; and catch the cameos of Javier Bardem as Felix and Jason Stratharn as the man Cruise bumps into in the opening scene.<br /><br />COLLATERAL works on many levels and I enjoyed it, although its rather despondent ending only reinforces Cruise's assertation that death is so common in LA that one might not even notice someone is dead.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith and Kevin James are hilarious...a good date movie"></head><body><p>Will Smith (Bad Boys 1 and 2, Wild Wild West) stars as Kevin Hitchinson but call him Hitch and he is a date doctor who hooks up desperate men to the women they have feelings for. Kevin James (Tv's King Of Queens) plays Albert Brenneman, a buisnessman who works for the woman for who he loves and shes a big star and shes on the cover on gossip magazines. James goes to Smith for help and Smith takes him under his wing telling the ways he has to get her attention and James succeds as he starts to become her new "man". Smith on the otherside falls for reporter Eva Mendes (Stuck On You, Training Day), who is sorta miscast, and they soon hit if off going on dates. It's a good Romantic Comedy but I dont think Mendes is the right one for Smith. Kevin James is great and Smith redeems himself from the rubble that was I, Robot last year. Also starring Jeffrey Donovan (Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, Bait). Better then most of the crappy comedies out there.</p></body></html>

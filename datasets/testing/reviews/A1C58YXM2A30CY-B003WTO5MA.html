Both were the same regarding the Lutz family and their buying a house that had a murder in it.  But the 1979 film had several scenes with the priest, a nun, the priest going crazy and catatonic, George's friends at work thinking he's crazy and so on.<br /><br />All these were cut out!  The 2005 film simplified things with the goings-on at the horror house, centering around the little girl and her invisible friend Jody.  There was more fear in this film:  a little girl balancing on a rooftop about to commit suicide, a dog being butchered, and George growing more and more insane with each passing day.  Ryan Reynolds was great as the slowly brewing psychotic who "hears voices" and wants to shoot up the family.<br /><br />I do miss the whole priest storyline from the 1979 film.  They had a token priest getting covered with flies and then he goes away and tells George's wife to move out.  Yawn!  There is the "get out" phrase being called to the priest, which was kinda cool.<br /><br />No homely babysitter who gets locked in the closet by a ghost.  Nope, we have a hot babysitter who takes every opportunity to show off her smooth abs as she tells the kids ghost stories and murder - at least until she gets locked in the closet (which has no locks) and goes insane!<br /><br />I'm not big on horror films but this one is pretty good.  Enough blood and gore to gross you out and several scenes of mayhem and fear to satisfy the casual horror film fan.<br /><br />DVD:  I enjoyed the special features, too many to list.  Several interviews with the actual people at Amityville, a spooky psychic, the police detectives of the time and so on.  A making of feature with the director, producer and make-up artist, and a chat with the cast.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Though I miss the charm of the 1979 film, the 2005 film is the better one.

<meta name="summary" content="This film is fun to watch and it is sexy"></head><body><p>This is a delightful film, jam packed with excitement. In addition, Angelina Jolie moves about in a tight t-shirt in virtually all the scenes, except the last few minutes, even in the freezing arctic, showing what appears to be, but may not be, artificially extended breasts. She is portrayed in the film as a virtual superwoman, what the disc cover calls the "ultimate superhero," with amazing intellect, strength, and agility. In fact, we see her training frequently in remarkable ways to maintain her skills.<br /><br />The plot is sci-fi. Nine planets will line up once every 5,000 years. This is an opportunity to combine certain items and gain enormous powers over time and space. Laura's now dead father trained her for this event. She is determined to do what her father requested. But there is a group of illuminati who also want this power, and their henchman who wants it for himself.</p></body></html>

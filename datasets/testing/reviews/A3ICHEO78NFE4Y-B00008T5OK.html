If you have an AC-3  system all you will get is 4 channel stereo and that's not all that good.  Also for some strange reason FOX doesn't seem to have any showmanship when  transferring this to DVD. What are the purpose of the &quot;still&quot;  during the entrance music to Act 2 ????  I was extremely disappointed by  the transfer. Of course the picture quality and of course the film itself  is outstanding. But for you sound buffs,,,,,,sorrrrry,,it's terrible.  Someone should show FOX the proper theatre way of presenting a roadshow  film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good rendition of the classic Marvel Superhero"></head><body><p>This is an enjoyable movie to watch.  Great special effects, good acting, and a decent plot make it worthy.  Could it have been done better?  Only in the plot.  I wont go into details since the plot has been told by many previous reviews, but the ending could of been done better.  I understand Marvel wanted to bridge the gap into the 21st century and have Captain America be a part of The Avengers, but the ending was not as good as expected.  That though is being picky on my part.  I enjoy Superhero movies and Marvel and DC have done an overall good job on bringing their characters to the big screen.  This movie is no exception.  It is great fun to watch and I recommend it to any Superhero fan!</p></body></html>

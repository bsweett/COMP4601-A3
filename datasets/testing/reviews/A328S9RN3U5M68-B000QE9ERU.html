It was only about a half hour into this rather violent picture that it became apparent that the characters were just too off the wall NOT to be comic book creations. Now Tom (aka Thomas) Jane is a worthy actor to portray such heroes: he certainly is buff and the camera concentrates more on his rather magnificent shirtless torso than on the story (a good choice in this case). John Travolta continues his survey of just plain evil guys, and the good guys equal the bad guys as far as character portrayal. The concept of Revenge (read Punishment) is developed a bit slowly because of Jane's character diversion of becoming an alcohol and hiding in a rooming house with some pretty absurd characters. But given the genre of comic book stories, this one stands up pretty well. It is so obvious that there will be more sequels (if this film makes any money on the world market) unless this singular effort becomes 'toast' like about every character in this LaLa Land movie. Yet, cheers for Jane and Travolta!</p></body></html>

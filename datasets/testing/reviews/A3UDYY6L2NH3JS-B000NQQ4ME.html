First of all 75% of all Maya inscriptions we know have not yet been deciphered and all we have on these Indians is one thousandth of what we would need to know just a little bit about the way these Indians lived, what's more thought. The vanity of those who say some details are wrong is absurd, especially since the cinema is not a tool to tell the truth but the art of complete illusion. A false detail can only be the drop that will make the bitter-minded overflow and the straw that will break the backs of the growling grouchers. So let me not be avaricious about this film. It reaches some extraordinary magnitude and magnificence. The pictures are among the most beautiful you can imagine, be they of the forest, or of the crossing of the river, or of the waterfalls on the same river, or of the Maya city and its pyramid temples, or of the costumes of their priests, or of the gladiator games for final cynegetic execution. The action  itself is so well built that we get involved in it so intensely that we are in the body of the hunted one, without remission, without any relapse. And yet a long slow phase enables the viewer to contemplate the simple life spiritually full with tales and legends in a village in the midst of the rain forest. It is not an anthropological film, but at this level it is a film that wants to introduce us into a completely unknown setting and it succeeds marvellously, be it the physical setting or be it the spiritual and mental setting. The way Gibson uses the face expressivity of his actors, all of them amateurs though, to tell more than half of the psychological and emotional density and even passions of his characters and situations is outstanding. Some say the story is held up with pieces of strings like an eclipse that comes just when necessary. But we mustn't forget that life is only held up by such pieces of string and that simple events like a train that does not run may change the destiny of thousands of people. Life is nothing but the result of haphazard and unforeseeable whims from our environment. Some also protest against this ? hollywoodian ? film without telling us what it means. The film was entirely shot in Mexico exclusively using non-professional actors from an ethnic group so far never seen on the silver screen before, entirely in their language, the modern form of Maya, and entirely subtitled. These are elements that can be considered as perfectly anti-hollywoodian. If it is the spectacular show that is at stake, then many other films, like Besson's Purple Rivers, are nothing but hollywoodian films. And then what ? The most serious critics say that Mel Gibson is pondering on the fate of civilizations when they reach their final phase of self-destruction. It's both proper viewing and false understanding. It is the minimum discourse that we can see in these absurd human sacrifices to make an eclipse come and go or to palliate several years of bad crops with self mutilation, cannibal self sacrifice, suicidal self-centered morbidity. It is in a way the official method to adjust the population to the means available for survival set in some grandiose and dramatic organization of the elimination of a fringe of overpopulation. And the whole process is supposed to be bringing the most intense pleasure to the participants. We can then compare this with all the executions of human beings in humanity still practiced here and there. The death penalty aims in the same way at purifying society through some ignominous and horrifying practice, rite or crime. Long live war, preemptive or not ! But we would miss, if we stopped there, the great loop of symbolical and parabolical meaning that starts at the very beginning with the purchasing of the right to cross the forest with the exchange of three fish against one tapir leg, then the pregnant woman who must run away from killers and be saved from a flood, to finally end with the reunification of the primary family and its two sons who go back into the forest to start all over again from scratch while another ferocious band of invaders is arriving who will be just as blood-thirsty as the local one for unaccaptable reasons that have been explained and exposed in many books of the time. Adam and Eve leave with Abel and Cain to reinvent life. But the human curse is looming high in the two brothers and the myth they are rerferring to. Here Mel Gibson tells us humanity is nothing but a long history of horrors that constantly repeats itself. Only the forms and the dressings may change.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></body></html>

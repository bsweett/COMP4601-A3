There are more holes in this plot than in a round of Swiss cheese.  The plot holes are unfortunate because the premise of Aliens fighting predators with humans caught sort of in the middle was interesting.<br /><br />A satellite owned by Weyland Corporation, headed by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen!), spots a heat source under an ancient pyramid, under a couple thousand feet of ice.  The heat source must have been really big current day sensors to spot it.  Someone should tell the Navy about this to aid in underwater detection of submarines.  When the Aliens melted the snow and ice to get to the pyramid you would have thought that a heat source thousands of times greater than the energy put out by the pyramid would have been detected by somebody.  Also, you would think after encountering the Aliens in previous movies and consistently fairing poorly that Lance Henriksen would have learned his lesson.  I like Lance Henriksen, but how many times can one person be killed or maimed by Aliens?<br /><br />Anyway, Weyland puts together an expedition to the pyramid, just coincidentally at the same time Predators arrive, which in retrospect has to be on a routine Alien hunting trip.  You can imagine that the Predators are upset that the humans are in their hunting lodge.  Anyway, humans cause an Alien queen to be awakened and start laying eggs, which also triggers the closure of the pyramid.  Just before the pyramid closes the Predators arrive and slip under the door as it closes.  We soon learn that the pyramid reconfigures itself about every 10 minutes, because the creators of the pyramids, Aztecs, I think, worked on a metric system.  The only problem is that the Aztecs used a base 20 numbering system, which is definitely not metric, which is base 10.  Okay, every movie can be forgiven some implausibility, so move on.  Wait a moment, there are places where it seemed like the pyramid was reconfiguring itself in just two or three minutes, and then for a lengthy period in the last part of the movie the action went on for a long time while the pyramid did not move at all.  Perhaps I can forgive yet another implausibility.<br /><br />The Alien eggs soon begin to hatch and humans and Predators fall prey to the spidery little Alien hatchlings.  Soon fully grown Aliens start preying on the humans.  Wait a moment.  I thought Aliens took longer than an hour or two to get to full size.  I guess for the sake of action and pace logic is continuing to be suspended.  I also wonder whether I was the only one to notice that there were far more fully grown Aliens than there were dead human hosts.  Since the Predators did not bring extra victims with them where did all the hosts come from?  Also, the hatchlings seem to emerge from the humans in a matter of minutes versus the much longer period of time we saw in the first Alien movies.  I realize at this point that I am thinking too much about plot consistency.  Actually, thinking about this movie at all hurts at this point.<br /><br />The Aliens, humans and Predators all mill around in the pyramid trying to kill each other to the end of the movie.  The relatively soft humans are really little sport for either the Aliens or the Predators.  What surprised me was that the Predators were not that much of a match for the Aliens.  I would have thought that their armor and helmet would have been durable enough to withstand the Alien blood and the little fanged mouth part that comes jetting out, but apparently the helmets were about as strong as plastic and had nearly no resistance to Alien mouth parts.  Curiouser and curiouser.  I leave the ending to the patient viewer to discover.<br /><br />This movie really has no relationship to previous Alien movies at all.  It can not have any relationship because if it did it would make even less sense.  For example, the movie implied Aliens come to Earth every 100 years.  I guess someone should tell Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Glover that they are dealing with rogue Predators who do not follow the rules of the worst movie in this series.  Also, the movie said that human sacrifices were expected, yet the Predators brought none with them.  What is up with that?  First, in earlier movies Predators were hunting humans and we were seen as one big hunting ground.  Now the Predators have no interest in us and never have?  Second, we know that Predators find it easy to capture us, so getting sacrifices would have been easy.  I do not buy that heat from the pyramid was supposed to attract victims to the pyramid.  How could the Aliens know enough would show up?<br /><br />Lastly, given the violence and R-rating of the previous movies, I recognized that the studio toned the movie down so that the movie could be watched by younger audiences, as though this was a good thing.  Relaxing the standards of the previous movies in addition to the constant logical lapses detracted significantly from the movie for me.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first two Alien movies immensely.  The third and fourth movies were fair, but made an attempt to be logical and consistent.  This movie decided that they could make anything up they needed to create some sort of plot without considering that viewers might actually think about the movie.  Of course, given that the Predators act like a bunch of rednecks anyway, maybe that is what was expected.  Watch this movie for the action, but do not ascribe any sort of coherency or thought to the plot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fun.  But Brad Pitt?  I love Brad, but he ain't no Achilles."></head><body><p>I kept thinking--is this a movie or a Breck commercial? At least during the scenes with Achilles.  (Okay, and maybe the ones with Helen of Troy, that rarest of the rare--a strawberry blonde Greek with blue eyes to boot).  Pitt is so out of his element here, it's almost funny.  He looks like a male model at a monster truck rally. I especially liked how quickly he cleans up from one moment to the next, and not just from one scene to the next.  It's almost uncanny.  Brad, do more films like 12 Monkeys and Fight Club.  <p>Brian Cox is the standout, in terms of performances.  He plays a lovely old King, a greedy, bloodthirsty, and self-aggrandizing son-of-a-bitch who'd send 10,000 men to their doom just to get a little more power.  Cox gives him just enough growl, just enough macho, and just enough decay to pull it off.  And, speaking of decay, don't be surprised if Peter O'Toole makes the obituaries in this year.  He looks just about finished, and his performance looked like it was squeezed out of him.  (In one scene, with Pitt, O'Toole's eyes are half-focused, like he's not even seeing Pitt.  Sad, really.  I'm quite convinced it was no act.)<p>I gave this bombastic spectacle three stars simply because the battle scenes are nice, and the ultimate slugfest between Achilles and Hector was engaging.  I found myself shifting in my seat in response to the blows they traded.  Nicely done.  Hopefully, most know the story.  The ending is a bit of a downer, but I suppose it's nice that Hollywood didn't have a choice about it.</p></body></html>

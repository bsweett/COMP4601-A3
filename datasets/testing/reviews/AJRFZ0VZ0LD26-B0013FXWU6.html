<meta name="summary" content="A story of an American dream only an American can tell"></head><body><p>This film is a total package art form.  It has fascinating story, all around great actors and mesmerizing music that from the start is letting us know that there could not be possible good ending to this storytelling.  We learn about Daniel Plainview, a man who is living in California searching for oil.  It is late 1800s and people are still trying to find their own riches in the new land.  Daniel is shrewd, calculated and persistent.  He wants to succeed in his endeavors more than anything.  We learn about the day of the oil man rigger who life is full of physical demands and hard work.  Job is dirty and dangerous and oil fields are not afraid to claim their victims.  As Daniel becomes successful and accumulates capital, he is eager to continue searching for new wells and dig them until there is no more oil left.  In that effort helps him his young son whose innocent looks and quiet demeanor are bait for family people eager to sell their property to another family man trying to make a living for himself and his motherless son.  This all continues well until Daniel meets his arch nemesis - a local preacher who wants to make a congregation from the local oil diggers and their families.  Over the years, these two have their own disagreements and manage to get even with each other only to prove to each other that they are really the same and as such cannot coexist.  What fascinated me is the character of Daniel - he is dark, full of hatered and contempt of people even the ones closest to him, he is a loner without ever feeling lonely who knows how to feed of other people's emotions and needs and then use them to his own advantage.  This is one of those films that everyone should have in their personal library.  Daniel Day Lewis has won Academy Award for his role of Daniel Plainview but I must say that young Paul Dano was a great supporting actor too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Sequel!!!!!!"></head><body><p>Halloween 1 was a classic. Halloween 2 does not disappoint us as the sequel. Again starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence with their wonderful acting, Halloween 2 is just as if not more scarier and suspenseful than part 1. Although taking place in a hospital, that does not take away from this great movie. Michael Myers is back and still out to get his sister. Of course, others lose their lives along the way! Excellent movie just like part 1!!!!!</p></body></html>

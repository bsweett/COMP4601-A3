He finds a suitcase of money, and decides to just take the money and run.  He lives in a trailer with a young wife, and realizes they are both at risk when he takes the $2 million for himself.<br /><br />Heading the drug-related transaction, Anton Chigurh, is the psychopathic killer and on Moss' trail like a hound dog.  He has no empathy, just dispassionately kills almost every person involved in his hunt for the money.  Moss tries to keep one step ahead of the bloodbaths, but Chigurh is relentless.<br /><br />Sheriff Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) sees the enormity of the crimes, and understands the growing intensity of the pursuit.  He is smart, but realistic.  He is also soon to be retired.<br />From the beginning, the Sheriff tries to convince Moss, through his wife, Carla Jean, that he should turn the money over to authorities.  He has a bad feeling this is ending in tragedy.<br /><br />In the end, the cat and mouse game is between Tom and Anton.  Tom goes to a hotel room (behind the crime scene yellow tape) where the assassin waits.  Chigurh has shot the lock cylinder out, indicating to Ed that it's Chigurh's doing, and both of them watch the other's movement in the reflection in the shiny lock tube. Ed Tom draws his pistol and enters for a search, and realizes the killer is still within, given the locked window in the far room.<br /><br />The ending surprises you, no matter what you think is going to happen..... The bad news is that the problems raised in the film end up unresolved.</p></body></html>

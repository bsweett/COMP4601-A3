<meta name="summary" content="The Hurt Locker Movie Review"></head><body><p>This is not my favorite movie genre, but I will say it is a well-made movie.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker was directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) and written by Mark Boal. It stars Jeremy Renner as Sgt. William James, a team leader for a bomb squad stationed in Iraq. The other members of his team are Sgt. JT Sanborn played by Anthony Mackie and Spc. Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty. The story takes place over a 39 day period where Bravo company is waiting to be relieved so they can go home.<br /><br />This movie's directing is fantastic. The terrifying suspense that builds over time with each bomb wondering if it will be someone's last bomb to attempt to defuse. The terrain, heat, and dust were so well captured, they were making ME thirsty! Emotionally, the life and death situation these soldiers were put into everyday really messed with their psyche and perception of their mortality. James is a wildman, fearless to just jump into any situation recklessly, Sanborn tries his best to keep everyone safe but is afraid of commitment and getting too close to a woman back home, and Eldridge is getting therapy from a Colonel because he so intensely feels the strain that every day he might die.<br /><br />The actors very clearly defined their characters. All were well developed with layers in their performance, not all bravado or all fear. They just worked amazingly well as a unit. I have a hard time even singling out any of the three because as soon as I attribute something to one in my head, I remember something else one of the others did. Let's just say they handled the heavy burden of this movie incredibly well and I hope to see more from them in the future.<br /><br />One last note, turns out James' wife back home is Evangeline Lilly, Kate from LOST. My husband and James have something in common, if that was what they had to come home to, they'd be bored too, haha. We're not Kate or Jack fans. We are fans of Locke and Ben and Hurley!</p></body></html>

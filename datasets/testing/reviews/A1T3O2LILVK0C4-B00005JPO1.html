Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a bust. The screenplay was amateurishly written and the film itself is directed with juvenile enthusiasm. The overall mood of the picture doesn't even feel like that of Indiana Jones, but rather more like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1SZAO">National Treasure</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CWESA">The Mummy Returns</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXZ1">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</a>. This is not the Indiana Jones that I grew up with, certainly not the anti-establishment, cynical yet humorous hero who went on adventures with a devil-may-care attitude.<br />Now there are a few positive things to say about this film (not many). Mainly Harrison Ford still has "it". He's fantastic as Indiana Jones as he always has been and probably always will be. Unfortunately the way his character is written seems to contradict his persona of the original three films. In one scene when confronted with a group of clich&eacute; Communist villains intent upon his destruction, they ask him if he has any last words... he responds, "I like Ike." What the fedora?<br />As for the Communists in the film, they are in no way an accurate portrayal of Socialism. They are nothing more than fill-ins for the Nazis of Raiders and Last Crusade. There is no historical value in their portrayal here, none. I had no idea that the filmmakers were going to turn Indiana Jones into a conservative, narrow-minded hypocrite. I'm not coming to the defense of the Soviets in their actions but to the defense of the history of politics.  And as for the idea that Communists have always been fascinated with the occult and psychic abilities, this is only partially true. In the 1940s and `50s, some dictatorial figures in the Soviet Union were interested in ideas such as mind control. But this is a very small group of fanatics, most of which never came into power. However the idea that the Communists held the same plebian concepts about the occult that Hitler did, is an insult. (One of the main ideas behind Communism was that religion on a whole operated on two simple and destructive emotive factors: fear and the need to invert it into faith, and hate with its initial birth from ignorance and beliefs concerning superiority and inferiority. For further studies of this subject, try reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591023068">And God Created Lenin: Marxism vs Religion in Russia 1917-1929</a>, which examines the conflict between Communism and Christianity.)<br /><br />Indy searches for a fabled crystal skull that may hold great power, which is why the Soviets are after it. Other plot elements include the discovery of an ancient Aztec civilization, Indiana Jones reunites with Marion, Mutt Williams becomes Indy's young sidekick and a traitorous spy weaves in and out of the story. Not to mention the aliens. Correction: "Inner-dimensional Beings".<br /><br />The entire plot feels something akin to an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002W4TNA">Ed Wood</a> film. Now I'm not one to compare films (I find it to be elitist and narrow-minded) but since Spielberg and Lucas seem to feel that recycling all their old films into new ones is acceptable, I don't feel that I will have lowered myself at all. This could be viewed as the Indiana Jones equivalent to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006HBUJ">Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</a>. In fact Indy even uses the classic Star Wars line, "I've got a bad feeling about this." And that's not the only reference to other Spielberg and Lucas films. The "beings" look just like those in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECAD0">Close Encounters</a>.<br />There's even a scene in which Indy climbs into a refrigerator to escape a nuclear blast while on a test site in the Nevada desert. This entire scene is simply an in-joke that refers to an old version of the screenplay for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AL1E">Back to the Future</a>. In that early draft Doc's time machine was a refrigerator and Marty was only able to escape the `50s by going to a nuclear test site in the Nevada desert. Notice the mindless repetition. There are of course other in-jokes that revolve around the Indiana Jones films as well. Hey, did you just see the Lost Ark? Uh, huh.<br />When will directors learn that sequels are often unnecessary? We didn't need three sequels to Jaws, the prequels to Star Wars, the sequels to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BCE918">Jurassic Park</a> or this pathetically inadequate sequel to Indiana Jones. Why do they feel the need to re-release their classic films with new special effects and new footage? Why do we suffer through summers of endless sequels, prequels, remakes and spin-offs? I'll tell you why. Most of the directors have lost not only their originality but also their artistic integrity. They're greedy, capitalist schmucks. They don't care about the fans of their films or of their characters. They only care about merchandising, exploiting their fame, and making as much money off their once brilliant ideas as possible. It's sad really.<br />I'm not one to dictate to others but if you're a fan of Indiana Jones, I'd suggest you skip this and go watch the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">DVDs of the originals</a>. In fact you'd probably be best if you didn't even acknowledge this fiasco of a film. I know that ignoring the new Star Wars and Indiana Jones films may seem juvenile and melodramatic to some, but not as juvenile and melodramatic as the films themselves are. In conclusion the Indiana Jones legacy is history. Its remnants shall be lost along with those of other franchises driven into the dirt by greedy filmmakers.<br />The only way to bring Indy back would be to have him go back in time and erase this part of his story arc. Yes, that's it! He should meet up with Doc Brown and build a time machine and go back in time. And perhaps he'll go back too far and end up in the Cretaceous Period where he'll be forced to fight off the Jurassic Park dinosaurs only to be saved by E.T. and Chewbacca. Really, this would be great. In fact I think someone should pitch this idea to Spielberg. *<br /><br />* = ironic statement</p></body></html>

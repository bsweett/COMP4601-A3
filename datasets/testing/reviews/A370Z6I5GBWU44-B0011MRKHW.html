I enjoyed the first Elizabeth movie, so I thought I'd enjoy the sequel. And it starts off promising - but it quickly became tedious and boring. I'm a history buff, I love history movies. But I did not love this one. It had a good amount of historical inaccuracies, and the script was plodding. I let out a sigh of relief when it was over.</p></body></html>

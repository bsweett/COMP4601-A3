<meta name="summary" content="Great 80's horror!"></head><body><p>This movie still can scare the [....] out of me. The plot, setting, acting, tone, and suspense all work together. Also the music is SOOO creepy! I din't watch this until a few years ago, and it wasn't so dated that I couldn't get into it, which is the case for some older horror movies. It's one of Kevin Bacon's first movies. It's a whodunit kind of horror movie, and I reccomend it highly. If you don't like this, 80's horror probably isn't the genre for you.</p></body></html>

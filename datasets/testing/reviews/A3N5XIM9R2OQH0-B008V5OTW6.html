Concerning the Israeli response to the infamous terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Olympics that resulted in the deaths of 11 Israeli competitors, Munich largely follows the Israeli contingent charged with killing the Black September planners behind the assault.  Obviously it has extra significance in the here and now, when fears of terrorism are so rampant, but Munich makes for a great watch anyway simply because it's so effective in its portrayal of the forces that drive people to devote so much time, energy, and resources to kill each other when they could be engaged in more constructive activities.  The technical abilities of Spielberg and his sidemen are of course on full display, but more than Spielberg's other serious movies (Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, most notably), the chief source of Munich's success lies in its nuanced portrayal of such complicated and touchy subject matter.<br /><br />Easily manipulated automatons, er, I mean patriots of any stripe may not find Munich to their liking, but it contains more than enough subtle shadings and moral ambiguity to please thinking viewers.  With ample room to operate given its considerable running time, Munich eventually develops into three movies: a taut political thriller, a complex examination of vengeance, and a harrowing look into the recesses of one man's mind.  Its blunt depictions of violence, emotional intensity, and frequent gallows humor may be unpleasant, but much like in The Pianist, discomfort is the name of the game here.  And much as the Pianist's tale of simple, brute survival could be applied to situations other than the Holocaust, Munich's (admittedly somewhat fictionalized) revenge story has a resonance well beyond the Middle East, which I'm sure is what Spielberg intended.<br /><br />Although it's told almost entirely from a Jewish point of view, the brilliance of Munich lies mainly in the fact that it doesn't ask the viewer to take sides (in spite of some of the rather shallow criticisms I've seen on this site and elsewhere), but instead examines the endless cycle of retaliation in a way that makes each side's case look both equally sensible and equally insane.  While it's mercifully short on long-winded oratory, the dialogue still frequently touches on the fact that each side thinks its claim to Israel is perfectly legitimate, and that there's plenty of guilt in the conflict to around.  Spielberg doesn't attempt to cover up the brutality of the Palestinian assualt in Munich, but as one member of the Israeli hit team notes, Arabs weren't the inventors of bloodshed.  Granted, we only hear second-hand about the Israeli government's less-than-warm-and-fuzzy treatment of its Palestinian population, but there's enough discussion of it to pierce any veneer of righteousness in Isreal's actions. Violence against civilians is a double-edged sword, the movie seems to be saying, one that people only notice when their own are the victims.<br /><br />Since the story is mostly told through the eyes of one man, it's a good thing Eric Bana is so chillingly convincing as Avner, a low-level Mossad agent and quiet family man given the task of leading the Israeli hit team.  Despite his lack of experience, Avner actually makes the perfect man for his job, as the nature of his work may give him pause, but in the end he compartmentalizes, accepts the justifications he's given, and kills whom he's told to kill.  As the movie makes clear, it's essential to any war or war-type conflict that we get by the fact that our enemies are every bit as human as we are, much as we might like to pretend otherwise.  Avner isn't one to stop and think carefully about what he's doing (at least until he's done, anyway), so it takes on added weight at the end of the movie when he does finally realize how little he's accomplished.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as we all know by now, this story doesn't have a happy ending, and the events of the past thirty years weigh heavily on Munich.  Of course, if everyone had made up back in the '70's, the subject matter wouldn't seem quite as important.  In the end, this movie supports a conclusion I reached a while back: the world would be a much better place if humankind declared a mulligan on all of history up till now, admitted every group has done some naughty things, and started over.  Of course, since the odds of that happening are about the same as the chances of the Red Sox winning the next Super Bowl, I'm not keeping my fingers crossed.</p></body></html>

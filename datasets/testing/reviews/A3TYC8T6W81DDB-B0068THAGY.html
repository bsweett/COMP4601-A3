I never bothered with any of the TV series he was involved with ("Alias," "Lost," "Fringe") and after practically loathing Mission: Impossible II, I skipped III altogether. On the other hand though, Star Trek was pretty fantastic, Joy Ride sits comfortably in my collection of guilty pleasures, and Cloverfield was pretty decent at times. So Abrams work basically ranges from okay to amazing to me. So you can understand why my excitement for Super 8 was easy to contain. Trailers didn't reveal much of anything. Other than some kids making a zombie movie that witness a devastating train crash with some sort of extraordinary creature as its cargo being unleashed and the trailers giving off a big E.T. vibe, there wasn't much else to take away from it. That's the point with an Abrams project though; that key element is kept secret to pique interest and the payoff is usually something spectacular. Super 8 certainly delivers something worth waiting for.<br /><br />We spend most of the time with the kids of the film. If it's not the zombie film we're focused on, it's the friendship between Joe (Joel Courtney) and Charles (Riley Griffiths) or the relationship that develops between Joe and Alice (Elle Fanning). Something tragic happens to Joe and it's a story point that manages to make itself relevant throughout the course of the film. As you can imagine, the first half of the film is a little slow. Things crawl along while some depth is added to the characters. Character development is never something to be ashamed of.<br /><br />The train wreck is where things pick up. The sound effects used in the film are so loud, so distinct, and so precise that it makes you feel like you're actually there at that train station witnessing this horrific event in person. The sound utilized in the film is a huge drawing point for seeing the film in theaters. Explosions are felt not heard as the creature's screams seem to vibrate your very bones.<br /><br />Speaking of explosions, the special effects are also quite impressive. The teases leading up to the creature's big reveal draw a lot of interest. Cars being thrown in the air, heavy machinery being totally destroyed in an instant, something monstrous and inhuman being seen in reflective surfaces, and people screaming for their lives as something races across the screen and abducts them. But obviously the actual creature is the high point of the special effects. Look no further than the Kelvin gas station scene, the bus scene, or the entire finale for proof of this. As far as the creature is concerned, Cloverfield will probably be the first thing that comes to mind. But you actually get to SEE what was on that train and it's fairly astounding.<br /><br />The film is kind of like if E.T. and The Goonies were combined into one film along with bits of Cloverfield and Battle: Los Angeles injected into it. You know, if Battle: Los Angeles wasn't a total letdown.<br /><br />Super 8 is a rather brilliant sci-fi thriller. There's plenty of buildup and character development, which results in big action sequences having a bigger impact and actually makes you care about these characters when something goes wrong for them. The creature is teased for so long that when you do finally see it, it feels like a huge accomplishment. The cast of kids is really the heart of the film while Elle Fanning's exceptional acting puts her ahead of the pack. The film blindsides you in the gut with a strong assault of emotion that makes you reminisce the best and most memorable Steven Spielberg films. Not to mention the outstanding special effects and loud yet engaging use of sound. Super 8 is an emotionally powerful sci-fi film featuring a wonderful cast, solid storyline, immense sound effects, groundbreaking special effects, and some ridiculously awesome action sequences.</p></body></html>

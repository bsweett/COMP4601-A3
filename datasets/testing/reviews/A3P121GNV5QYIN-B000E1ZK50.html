<meta name="summary" content="This should be fun"></head><body><p>Directed by the man who brought us The Mummy series,Stephen Sommers,Van Helsing should be interesting to see.Based on the famous character from Bram Stoker's Dracula Van Helsing,played by Hugh Jackman,who we all know is the vampire hunter in the story.But in this film,he doesn't just go after Dracula,he goes after the famous monsters to grace both books and the silver screen like Frankenstien,The Wolfman and others.I don't think the film will be scary,but I think it will be a fun movie to watch.</p></body></html>

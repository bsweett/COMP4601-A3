<meta name="summary" content="Many ideas that I wished they played with (review of the Theatrical release)"></head><body><p>This is a movie that pushes the boundaries of right and wrong. You are struck head on with the moral dilemma that perhaps we all must eventually deal with. This movie is not so much a scary movie as I thought is was marketed, it is a simple story of the difficulties and unforeseen consequences of choice. You will either come to hate the choice made in this film or else support it because of the possibility of wonderful benefits. I won't dare give away any major spoilers nor will I tackle the ethics that I dealt with. I thought that this movie was average. I had no unrealistic expectations, but still, I was bummed out that many possible ideas were not played with in this movie. It was cut and dry and touched upon what makes us human from a completely different perspective though.<br /><br />There are some disturbing moments in this film. Without spoiling it for you, I was mortified by the strange sexual confrontations of this film. How does it make you feel? I suppose this is a question left for your Physchologist after seeing this movie. Reality is so far driven from our minds in this movie, by its clumsy approach to rather fascinating concepts, that nothing I take in is weighty, but rather it becomes shallow, and without emotional investment. And the director of this film is a true visionary. He made Cube, which is everything that I value artistically, and yet, amazingly, is missing now. He has turned the page from those days, and entered into a new style. He abandons his Kafkaesque approach to film, and now, the company is in your face, with an attempt to play God.<br /><br />The special effects were nice if not bare, and the design of the "creature" was fascinating at most for me. I did think that some of the interactions in this movie were laughable. A new meaning of "men being men" in this movie. There were few surprises in this movie. I did come into this movie with an open mind as a student of science, but I did not think that this movie was presented the best. For instance, there are some interesting side experiments going on that they did not flesh out more than they could have. I wanted a more David Cronenberg fell to it, like his "fly" remake. I don't think people should avoid this film either, because the spliced creatures were interesting, and also some of the themes are worth exploring.</p></body></html>

This is a great crime film but as far as the other piece of hype let me just inform you that DeNiro and Pacino are only in two scenes together and those 2 scenes are very short.  If you watch this movie expecting anything more concerning the pairing of these two giants of the film world then you'll be deeply disappointed.  If you can around that fact then you'll enjoy Heat.<br /><br />Pound for pound I have to say that DeNiro is the better actor.  Pacino has a tendency to yell and scream his lines in hopes of being more intense and dramatic.  DeNiro doesn't have to do that.<br /><br />Heat contains one of the best shootouts I've ever seen on film.  The street scene with everyone shooting at everyone else is realistic and some may think over the top but I say it's on target (no pun intended).  While the main focus is on the good guy trying to catch the bad guy, the other view is of these two men and their external relationships with others outside of what they do.  Note also that they secretly admire each other.  So much so in fact, that they agree to meet each other and state that they will do what they have to do to come out on top.  I've often wondered if they could really have been brothers and therefore, hesitant to kill one another.  Hence the meeting to warn the other man what might happen.<br /><br />Although there is plenty of action here, it's the story that drives the film.  It's not just a shoot 'em up.  I enjoyed seeing Dennis Haysbert (played the president on 24) here.  His role isn't that big but at least he gets to go out in a blaze of glory.  Somebody give this guy more films to do!!!<br /><br />As usual with these kind of films one tends to root for the bad guy.  Pacino's character, for me a least, evokes no sympathy.  He ignores his wife and stepdaughter for the sake of the job and his wife cheats on him because he won't talk to her.  You just don't feel sorry for him.  DeNiro's character on the other hand is a guy that never allowed himself to have all the trappings of a normal life.  He never wanted to feel tied down.  He wanted to be able to  pick up and take off at a moments notice.  That changes though and you want him to get away with this last crime and then settle down to be "normal".<br /><br />Val Kilmer is excellent as the cumpulsive career criminal/gambler that just can't let go of his life of crime no matter how much his wife (Ashely Judd) begs him.<br /><br />The final scene is wonderful.  Cinematography, scenery, characters and music all fit together so well that you can't take your eyes off the screen.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the genre then you must have this film in your collection.</p></body></html>

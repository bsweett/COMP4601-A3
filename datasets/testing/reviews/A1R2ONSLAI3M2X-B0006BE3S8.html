<meta name="summary" content="A Weak 3 Stars...."></head><body><p>Being a fan of the original Predator movie which I really enjoyed even though when Predator takes off his "armour mask", I've always said that that's the ugliest thing I've ever seen in a horror movie and I've seen hundreds and hundred of horror movies!!!!!! and being a fan of the Alien movies, which to me were much better having Sigourney Weaver in them. I don't think another actress could have played her role any better. Ok, having liked both movies, I eagerly awaited this movie to see the showdown between these 2 creatures.... kinda like Freddy vs. Jason. For being rated PG-13, I thought this movie was good, especially the special effects. I wish it would have been rated R however. I heard several gory scenes were left out giving it the PG-13 rating. Without going into all the details of the movie.... basically, an expidition to Antarctica finds a dwelling ground where the aliens live and we find the predators wanting to "move in". Ultimately, we see the "showdown" between Alien vs. Predator and the movie keeps you guessing as to who the winner will be.. if there is one. To me, this movie isn't as bad as reviews have said it is but there will always be a difference of opinions! Worth renting even if you have never seen any of the Predator or Alien movies.</p></body></html>

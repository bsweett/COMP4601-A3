<meta name="summary" content="One of Pixar's Best Ever!"></head><body><p>'The Incredibles' does Pixar's creative team proud once more, blending literally jaw-dropping CGI animations with excellent voice talent, huge production values, a hefty dose of humour, and most importantly, an excellent storyline.<br /><br />Blacklisted and in a Hero Protection Programme, because of a legal loophole that allows Superheroes to be sued, the Parr family appears to be, at least to the casual observer, an average, traditional family of suburbanites. Dad works in Insurance, Mom stays at home with the kids. Normalcy being relative, however, frustrated father Bob accepts an invitation from the mysterious 'Mirage' to help her tame a wild robot, thus resuming his activities as the superhero Mr. Incredible.<br /><br />And in the grand traditions of dual identities, action and adventure, and double-crossings, the Parr family is caught up in a plot to exterminate all Do-Gooders.<br /><br />The animation is beautiful - super-deformed characters move with a grace and fluidity that makes their cartoony world believable, and water and flame effects surpass even those seen in 'Finding Nemo'. The direction, too, is superlative - who can say what the latter 'Batman' movies might have been if they'd had this sort of creative impetus behind the camera?<br /><br />Vocal talent comes in the shape of Craig T. Nelson as lovable and impulsive Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as his frustrated wife Elastigirl, and Brad Bird's absolutely hilarious turn as superhero designer-turned-couturier Edna Mode is some of the best characterisation Pixar's ever given us.<br /><br />With such wonderful source material as this, a movie of a lesser storyline could have been catapulted into the ranks of animation greats, but thankfully Pixar scores on this front, too, and via a series of quirky events and clever, more mature themes (legal battles and infidelity - albeit very suitable for kids), 'The Incredibles' may well be even more appealing to the parents of the children it's been designed for.<br /><br />I can't recommend it highly enough.</p></body></html>

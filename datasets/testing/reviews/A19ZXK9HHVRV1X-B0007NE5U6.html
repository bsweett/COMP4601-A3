But at the beginning of "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason`" she seems not to have achieved the happy-ever-after ending that both she and we thought she had.  After only a short while together, Bridget suspects that Mark may be cheating on her, and Mark seems embarrassed by all the social faux pas Bridget commits while in public.<br /><br />Even before the opening credits had ended, I had a premonition that this film might be a stinker when I noticed that no fewer than four people were credited with having had a hand in the screenplay - a sure sign of trouble if ever there was one.  And I wasn't wrong, for "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason" stinks to the high heavens.<br /><br />And what did these four talented, highly paid writers come up with for all their efforts?  A patchwork mess consisting of preposterous situations, boneheaded dialogue, and thoroughly unappealing characters, that`s what.  Frumpy, shrill, desperate and wracked with insecurities, Bridget comes across as the kind of needy, high maintenance girlfriend that would send any reasonably self-respecting man racing not for the altar but for the exits.  It's amazing Mark puts up with her for as long as he does, yet, in all honesty, he`s really no more appealing than she is.  All they do is fight then make up, bicker then reconcile for nigh unto two hours with no rhyme or reason to any of it.  Every moment in the film feels pre-fabricated and arbitrary, with no connection at all to the real world or recognizable human emotions.  In short, as romantic partners, the two of them are so insufferable that I kept wishing that they would put their relationship out of its misery before some desperate soul in the audience did it for them.<br /><br />Renee Zelwegger and Colin Firth are annoying and grating as the ill-fated pair, and Hugh Grant sleazes his way through the part of the slime-ball news reporter, Daniel Cleaver.  All three actors deserve much better than being mired in a hopeless misfire like this one.  Instead of giving us believable characters in believable situations, the filmmakers pile on scene after scene of inane, embarrassing slapstick routines:  Bridget jumping out of an airplane, Bridget racing uncontrollably down a ski slope, Bridget getting drenched by passing motorist, Bridget getting arrested for cocaine possession in Thailand etc.  Then, in order to cover up for the emptiness of the screenplay, the filmmakers ladle on an endless series of golden oldies to fill up the soundtrack.<br /><br />"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason" is about as bad as a romantic comedy can get.  Let's hope some merciful soul over there in Jolly Olde England has the decency to toss Bridget Jones' next diary into the nearest incinerator before it can find its way to the screen.</p></body></html>

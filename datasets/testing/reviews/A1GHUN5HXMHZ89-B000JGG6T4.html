<meta name="summary" content="Bodyguard"></head><body><p>This isn't the first bodyguard movie, but it is certainly a good one. Denzel Washington is great playing a moody ex-CIA assassin that becomes a bodygurad for a wealthy Mexicans little girl. Pita played by Dakota Fanning is wonderful as that little girl. Denzel teaches her how to win in a swimming competition and she changes his life. Lots of character development here with some intense action especially three quarters of the way into the movie. Fans of Washington won't want to miss this one. Fans of movies like "Proof of Life", "The Bodyguard", "Eraser" or the Tom Clancy books/movies should like it. All the support cast is excellent and the side stories of their lifes added to the overall entertainment. I was surprised to see the dedication to the main character at the end. Apparently it is loosely based on a true story. This movie is gritty and sometimes hard and bloody. It should not be viewed by small children.</p></body></html>

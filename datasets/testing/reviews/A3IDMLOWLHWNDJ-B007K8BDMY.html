<meta name="summary" content="Troubled "Man""></head><body><p>"Grizzly Man" is a decent doc about Timothy Treadwell, the man who spent thirteen seasons in an Alaska national park living amongst the grizzly bears that inhabit the park. The documentary isn't without its faults.<br /><br />To say that Tim Treadwell was a troubled man, is like saying its dark out at night. He was a very troubled man. Trying to make it in Hollywood, Treadwell was a struggling actor. His claim to fame was being the runner-up for the role that would eventually go to Woody Harelson on "Cheers".<br /><br />With the loss of a role that would have led him to stardom, Treadwell fell into a deep depression (that I truly believe he never got out of, even with his 13 seasons of bear watching) that led to drinking & drug bingeing, until the early nineties when on a trip to Alaska, Treadwell had a run in with one of the park's  grizzly bears. Treadwell held his ground & to his amazement the bear backed off. The following season Treadwell returned & began his first of thirteen seasons with the bears.<br /><br />During the last five seasons, Tim brought a video camera, chronicling what would be the last five seasons of his life. In the final season, 2003, Treadwell brought his girlfriend, Aimmee Huegenard along for the season.<br /><br />By early October, the relationship between the two would be severely strained. The couple had made their way to the Grizzly Maze, the land where the grizzlies hunker down for the winter & hibernate. The final day they set up camp on the outskirts of the maze with, would have been, the following day packing up their gear & leaving the area for the season by plane. Treadwell & Hugenhard would never see the dawn. Sometime during the early evening hours the two would be killed & eaten by an older, desperate, hungry, grizzly bear that ironically enough, Treadwell had been filming & trying to communicate with earlier in the day.<br /><br />"Grizzly Man" is one of those films that sticks with you after you watch it. The films highlight's include a grizzly fight between two bears over the right to mate with one of the female bears, all nature footage shot by Treadwell, Treadwell's fox friends, the footage of Treadwell actually touching one of the grizzlies on the nose while filming with the hand held camera & the haunting images of Ammie who Treadwell never got a decent camera shot of (all the shots are in shadow or back to the camera, or her hair is over her face). Also some disturbing images that make one believe that Treadwell's mask of sanity was slowly slipping (the scene where he prays to God for rain is a bit much, but, then when it actually rains is even a bit more weird). The ranting of Treadwell & everything that was wrong in his life was absolute bonkers.<br /><br />There are some problems with this film however (henceforth, the three star rating).<br /><br />Werner Herzog himself narrated the film in his German accent & sound strained. He should have gotten a professional voice over artist for this.<br /><br />First off, here is a man who is clearly not in the right frame of mind "teaching" kids about grizzly bears. Not so much as teaching the class about grizzly bears but introducing the class to the bears who are his "friends".<br /><br />It's never shown what Treadwell did in the off season.<br /><br />It's never shown where Treadwell got his money for his equipment & supplies (sure one of the cameras was a Xmas gift but where did he get the other one from?).<br /><br />For me, the saddest part of all, is a tragic missed chance to really study & possibly learn more about the grizzly bear & it's habitat. Timothy Treadwell had a special gift, but, in my opinion, he never used it to the fullest extent. As for Timothy Treadwell, I hope has become one with the spirit of the Grizzly.<br /><br />"Grizzly Man" is a film that is worth seeing, but, like so many other mainstream films, doesn't live up to its own hype.<br /><br />You be the judge.</p></body></html>

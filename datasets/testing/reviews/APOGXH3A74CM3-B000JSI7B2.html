<meta name="summary" content="All in their own hell"></head><body><p>The performances of Ian Holm and Johnny Depp really make this a movie worth watching, as does all the attention to detail in recreating 1888 London.<br /><br />The story moved along quickly and was very suspenseful, exploring all the little hells of the main characters.

I was tempted to give it four stars, but there were no real drawbacks that would justify that, so it gets five stars.<p>The actors do a good job. John Corbett would appear to be John Travolta's brother -- similar looks, voice and mannerisms. The pair come off as made for each other and the timing of the playout of the romance is good.<p>The family representation is typical of large family marriages with a small family (like in our case and several other couples that we know). In that sense, much of the comedy may be easy to laugh at. However, for people not in that situation, they may ask themselves where the humor is. Still, there is enough to justify it for a good date with some romance in the air. Obviously a good choice for special occasions like Valentine's Day.</p></body></html>

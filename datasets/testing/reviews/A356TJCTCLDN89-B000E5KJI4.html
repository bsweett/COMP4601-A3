There is good, bad and nails-against-a chalkboard-horrible in Troy. <p>The Good:<br />Brad Pitt, from the neck down he looks might cute and he obviously took lessons for the fight scenes.<p>Peter O'Toole, the last of the great rowdy boys from Great Britain, gives a rather touching performance as King Priam. <p>Eric Bana and Sean Bean. Both do their jobs, don't embarass themselves and seem to be taking the whole thing seriously.<p>The Bad:<br />Diane Kruger as Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world. Judging by the reactions from the guys in the audience this actress was miscast.<p>The Pace. In this movie the Trojan War seems to last for a few hot days instead of a decade.<p>Brad Pitt, he looks really cute but when he opens his mouth to say his lines he sounds like a surfer boy pretending to be Hamlet. <p>Julie Christie as Thetis. She's supposed to be a nymph but looks like a suburban granny.<p>The ending. I won't give it away but it's not even within shouting distance of the one Homer wrote.<p>What's horrible:<p>The anachronisms. Breisis talks like a feminist and the relationship between Achilles and his "cousin" has been watered down to suit modern day tastes. <p>So, bottom line should you go to see Troy? Sure, it's an amusing Summertime movie and as long as you don't take it seriously or expect it be great you'll have a good time.</p></body></html>

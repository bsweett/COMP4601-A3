<meta name="summary" content="Yes, the title pretty much says it all on this one..."></head><body><p>There is a moment in "Meet the Fockers" when Pam makes a stand regarding her intention to marry Greg.  She will become Pamela Focker.  Greg opines it could be Pamela Byrnes-Focker.  "No, no, no," she insists, "I will be Pamela Martha Focker.  I know how that sounds, but, but, that's the name I'm taking."  I burst out laughing and my wife wondered why.  "Honey," I said with that sort of loving condescension that infuriates her to no end, "there is only one joke in this movie."  That is an exaggeration, but one look at the title and you know what the main joke is for this 2004 sequel to "Meet the Parents."  But Polo plays the moment so absolutely straight faced, not only because it makes the line work perfectly but also because the actress knows (a) this is probably the only laugh she is going to be able to get in the film and (b) it is impossible to compete with the rest of her cast mates when it comes to mugging and milking a scene, so why even try?<br /><br />This is a movie that stresses character over plot because the plot basically boils down to the same thing as last time: Jack is worried about Greg and makes an erroneous assumption that sends him off into full-blown CIA mode, yelling about the "Circle of Trust" and insisting his daughter cannot marry this man.  As Pam says, "Here we go again, Dad."  There is another family dinner where something both alien and familial is added to the table.  There is another pet to worry about.  However, the big difference is that for the sequel Greg's parents have been added to the mix and it is in the manic performances of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand that this film gets most of its laughs.  They are Bernie and Roz Focker, and they are as loose as Jack is uptight, plus they talk twice as fast, apparently in a frantic effort to find something genuinely funny to say.<br /><br />Last time Ben Stiller's Greg had to play second fiddle to Robert De Niro's Jack.  This time he not only has that burden again with his parents added to the mix, but there is a baby, Little Jack (Spencer & Bradley Pickren), who is being raised strictly in accordance with Jack's viewing of parenting.  Of course, Greg will take care of that in short order, the same way Jinx is going to get that little dog too.  The baby fits into the movie perfectly because when he finds his one laugh line, the kid sticks to it for the rest of the film.  Then there is poor Blythe Danner, pretty much forced into the 7th position in the film's hierarchy and taking small comfort in knowing her daughter has an Oscar given all the grown ups in this film have two a piece.  Dina finally gets a funny bit to play, as she uses sock puppets to role play a conversation between herself and her husband, and she has to play the scene in a long shot.  At least they gave her that much.<br /><br />There are plenty of chuckles in "Meet the Fockers," but with the basic story being the same and the main jokes being the same, it has to be less than the original.  Only having Hoffman and Streisand on board breathes some real energy into this sequel and when you find out that they were improvising a lot of their scenes that only underscores the inadequacies of the script.  I am sure the cast had fun making this film, but it really should have been funnier on this end given all the star power assembled in front of the cameras.</p></body></html>

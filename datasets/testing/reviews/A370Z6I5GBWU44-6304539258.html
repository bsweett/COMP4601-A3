<meta name="summary" content="Classic"></head><body><p>The first movie in the original Star Wars trilogy, this is a solid, die-hard classic movie which was the beginning of one of the biggest franchises that the sci-fi world (or fiction in general) has ever known, and for good reason. This movie did a great job with the sci-fi aspects given that back then, computer technology was very, very, VERY limited compared to today, and yet they managed to pull it off for a great movie.</p></body></html>

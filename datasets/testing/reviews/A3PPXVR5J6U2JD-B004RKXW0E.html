We reluctantly let him watch Toy Story and Toy Story 2.  It's interesting when you watch a G-rated movie before you have kids and compare it to your experience after you have kids.  The Toy Story series has a lot of things toddlers are taught not to do - calling each other idiots, punching each other in the face, and otherwise using "not nice words" that is an integral part of any comedy act. It's funny, but it ain't for kids.<br /><br />That's the brilliance of the Toy Story series.  It's about childish things but not about children.  The first Toy Story movie was as much about being a parent as it was about being a toy.  In Toy Story the parent (Woody) was replaced by the boy's new stepdad (Buzz).  Woody, old-fashioned and stubborn, had to blend the new and old families in a way that respected everyone involved.  And they did, unified by the love of their "son" Andy.<br /><br />Toy Story 2 was about putting the parent's needs above the child.  An injury reminded Woody of his mortality. He had an opportunity to forge his own path, independent of Andy.  Instead he chose to stay with the boy, forgoing fame for the love of his child.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 reaches the logical outcome that loomed in Toy Story 2.  Andy grew up. He's moving on to college and his "parents" are left behind. What's to become of them? Will they be stored away in some old attic, forgotten?  Or will they find a new life in retirement?<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is all about family.  What's more important is that they stick together, a point repeated by Buzz and Woody. They may lose their child, but at least they have each other.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is also a prison caper, complete with seemingly pleasant wardens, a prison gang, and escape attempts. And yet Toy Story 3 is far more entertaining than most live action prison escape movies. Packed with action, filled with poignant moments, and featuring all the characters we've come to know over a decade, Toy Story 3 is a love note to the toys - and people - we've left behind.  More Escape from Preschoolcatraz than a comedy, Toy Story 3 is an adult take on an adult problem.  It just happens to use toys to tell the tale.<br /><br />My son won't be watching Toy Story 3 until he's a lot older.</p></body></html>

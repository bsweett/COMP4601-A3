<meta name="summary" content="FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3"></head><body><p>FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 was the first film in the whole series where Jason Vorhees picked up the hockey mask that he would wear for the rest of the series (that is of course, after he kills the guy who was wearing it). This installment has a group of teenagers who go to a farmhouse in the country to party for the weekend, and the farmhouse just happens to be located down the road from Camp Crystal Lake, which means that the teenagers will eventually meet there death at the hands of our mutant maniac Jason. A welcome sense of humor helps this third entry in the series.</p></body></html>

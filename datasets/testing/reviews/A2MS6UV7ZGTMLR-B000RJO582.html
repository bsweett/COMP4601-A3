Romero made a killing for himself with his "Dead" trilogy (Night, Dawn and Day) and this is the 2004 remake of the second part of that gory trifecta. Fortunately, whilst the film has the same basic premise, it manages to add a whole series of plot twists which are not in the original. This should delight old and new fans alike - why just make a carbon copy of the original?<br /><br />Okay - so what's the basic premise? Well, an unknown disease is ravaging the planet. Once they have suffered a bite from an infected human, the victims rapidly waste away before dying a sudden death. Even more sudden is the re-animation of the corpses. Within 1-5 minutes after checking out, the corpses check back in with a maniacal blood lust that can only be sated by feasting on warm human flesh. The opening scenes of this movie are superb. The introduction of the zombies will have you on the edge of your seat, as they take place in an all-too-familiar everyday environment, giving an air of credibility to an incredible story. This is very much in the mould of the excellent 28 Days Later... and really sets the scene perfectly for the bedlam that follows. The only horror film I have seen recently which delivers such an impactful opening is the darkly delicious Final Destination 2. As the USA descends into hysteria and madness, with family members devouring each other willy-nilly, small groups of people huddle together and feverishly try to find refuge from the growing hordes of psychopathic zombies.<br /><br />Unlike your run-of-the-mill zombie of yore, these mothers don't shuffle aimlessly towards you - they run like the clappers and head directly for your jugular! A dwindling group of ever-more desperate fugitives from the zombie masses include a cop (Ving Rhames), a nurse who has just witnessed her neighbour's daughter rip her husband's throat out (Sarah Polley) and a man who is caring for his heavily pregnant wife (Mekhi Phifer). Gaining entry to a local mall, they are incarcerated by a bunch of paranoid, and power-crazed, security guards. Whilst initially they fully expect to be rescued by the armed forces, as the days pass by there is a growing realisation that there will be no saving "charge from the cavalry" and they will have to work together to fight their own way out of the mall. From the roof they spot a lone man, Andy (Bruce Bohne) on an opposing rooftop - fortunately directly above a gun shop. Communicating with binoculars and whiteboards, they strike up a friendship and determine to pool their food with Andy's guns and break out of their self-imposed prison...<br /><br />The pacing of the film slows a little during the middle third, becoming a little less tense and verging on the repetitive. This is only a relative observation however, because the opening minutes and the final reel are top-notch. The acting is credible throughout and even the dialogue has a refreshing touch of reality most of the time. There are a couple of weak plot points (a budding romance just does not make any sense given the recent history of the characters) and some of the scares are telegraphed too far in advance. The use of exploding gas bottles is a little - forgive the pun - overblown at times too (be careful - your barbie could take out a city block)! The editing too, can be a little frenetic at times, but this is a relatively minor peeve and can be forgiven when you consider the overall vibe of the picture. The casting is quite appropriate, with all of the main characters filling their roles rather well, and some interesting cameos to watch out for with the likes of Matt Frewer (Max Headroom anyone?) and horror royalty Tom Savini (Day of the Dead).<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead is a winner. It is by no means perfect - I thought there could have been more black humour in the mix - but it will not disappoint fans of the flesh-eating zombie genre. The film does contain a few jump-out-of-your-seat frights, but the flesh-eating is surprisingly a little under-done. That is not to say the film lacks gore - amputations and eviscerations do figure, but by and large your run-of-the-mill exploding head shot is the main course. This film has much more of an action component than the original, which was a straight up horror flick. In the true spirit of cheap horror flicks though, the obligatory gratuitous breast shots do still make an appearance. The make up special effects are superbly done and there appears to be a satisfying lack of (all too often painfully obvious) CGI on offer (bar the obligatory fireballs, and a couple of helicopter shots). In the main, this is a no-nonsense zombie-smashin', shotgun-blastin', action-horror fest. Perhaps not quite as chilling as the 1978 original, Dawn of the Dead: Director's Cut (2004) will delight fans nevertheless. Highly recommended for zombie aficionados everywhere. Oh - and by the way - it is essential that you watch until the ending of the closing credits as there is important plot information interspersed among them.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kick-Ass - I've always wanted to dress up in tight clothing and be beaten up."></head><body><p>The concept of an average, every day comic book geek donning spandex attire and becoming a super-hero is one that I find quite interesting. I'm sure there are a few crazy people in the world who have contemplated or even attempted just that, but in the comic world, the only character I've been familiar with becoming a super-hero with no particular superpower is Batman. When this was first released and up to the point of me seeing it, I wasn't familiar that this was also made into a comic book, but I was intrigued by the concept and motive behind why the kid in this film wanted to take the leap of faith in becoming a superhero. I gave it a go, and I must say I loved it. Don't expect a full blown comedy, as it's more of a serious action flick, but an enjoyable one nonetheless.<br /><br />Starring Aaron Johnson in the title role of Dave Lizewski, the film tells of how Dave has always wondered why nobody has tried being a superhero (except that one guy at the start of the film who ends up dead). Dave decides to stop wondering and buys himself a green and yellow spandex suit and calls himself Kick-Ass. Life as a super-hero doesn't start very well as he's almost killed in his first attempt at heroics, but he's soon back in action and becomes a viral hit as he's filmed saving a lonely stranger from being beaten up. This gets him some unwanted attention from Mob boss, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and his son Chris/Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Passe) as he's mistaken as being the man behind a number of mob deaths which were actually committed by the mysterious Father/Daughter team of Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage [sigh]).<br /><br />The films tone is something that is a lot more serious and brutal than you can possibly guess when first going into it as it starts off quite goofy and funny, but when he puts on his hero suit, the film takes a more serious turn. There are some bad points to the film, but thankfully they are outweighed by a plethora of good points; most importantly the character of Hit-Girl. There are two ways you can look at this character; you can be very disturbed by the fact that an 11 year old girl can call someone a f***er then proceed with blowing an enemies head off, or you can watch that exact scene and think "that is "f***ing awesome!" I chose to go with the latter as she was truly magnificent. Nick Cage, on the other hand, was far from magnificent.<br /><br />I know Cage has a devoted following of fans, but I think he's just awful. I can't take the man seriously in any role he plays, and in my eyes every moment he was on screen was just the pits (unless he was supported by other cast members). I could have easily given this film a 5 star rating had Cage's character been played by someone a lot more fitting for the role. I would've preferred someone along the lines of Michael Keaton or Kevin Costner, an old school actor that you can still appreciate today and not want to place your palm on your forehead in disappointment the moment they appear on screen.<br /><br />The look of the film and style of the film overall is brilliantly done. The fact that the film was released shortly before the comic and it was a project that came together collaboratively with Mark Miller working on the comic and Matthew Vaughn working on the movie, when I check the comic out, there will definitely be cool similarities. I would highly recommend this, not for Nick Cage, but for everything else.</p></body></html>

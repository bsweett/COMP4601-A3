<meta name="summary" content="May Have Raided Some Ideas, But A Unique Addition To The Series"></head><body><p>First off, there is a lot of disagreement among the reviewers.  Please, if you're reading these reviews to make up your mine, read some of the other reviews as well to have a balance of opinion.<br /><br />In this movie, there is an immediate plunge into action, followed by an introduction to folklore and an object for Indy to retrieve.  After betrayal, capture, dealing with icky creatures and letting you know he doesn't like snakes, Indy fights a strong man who meets an unpleasant end and is involved in an exciting chase before the final confrontation when the main villain gets what's coming.  Some people think I'm revealing too much of this movie.  Others will realize that I've described not only this picture but the other movies in this series as well.  Indiana Jones is a formula series, and it meets the formula requirements very well.<br /><br />Okay, this is not the most original movie.  There are some scenes that made me think of "Temple of Doom", while others reminded me of "The Last Crusade".  But first, I think it is hard to have a completely original plot oriented action adventure, and second is it made you think of other Indiana Jones movies as opposed to making you think of James Bond for example (though there was an "On The Waterfront" moment).<br /><br />Personally, this was my second favorite of the series, just edging out Temple of Doom, with Raiders being my favorite.  This has everything you expect -- great sarcastic lines from Indy; effective character introductions by Spielberg (nobody does better at making you notice a key character), a lesson against greed.</p></body></html>

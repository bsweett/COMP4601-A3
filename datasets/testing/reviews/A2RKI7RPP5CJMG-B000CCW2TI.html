<meta name="summary" content="Above Average Thriller"></head><body><p>"Red Eye" deserves three-and-a-half stars more than four, but I graded it up for one simple reason:  It isn't boring.  So many of today's so-called "thrillers" are just dull.  With "Red Eye," Wes Craven manages to create a bit of suspension by skillfully building up our primary characters in Lisa(the lovely Rachel McAdams) and Jackson(the sinisterly perfect Cillian Murphy).  When we are first introduced to Lisa, we learn that she's the one solid rock in a world full of chaos.  She helps a co-worker, talks with the taxi driver, and has a phone conversation with her father all at once.  She appears to be very control of not just her life, but the world around her as well.  Jackson's the typical gentleman, almost too nice.  He handles a situation that could have gotten nasty in a very nice and toned down way.  He is precise and calculating.  With these aspects of our primary characters fleshed out, we get on the red eye flight to Miami with them.<br /><br />Calculating as ever, Murphy's character makes sure that he and McAdams end up seated together.  As the plane takes flight, Murphy makes a proposition to McAdams.  It's a proposition that can quickly tear her world apart.  Does she give in to Jackson, or does she try to outwit him?  I can't say much more without giving away the conclusion of the film.<br /><br />Just know that this is an above-average thriller.  It won't make you fear flying anymore than you already do, but it will hold your attention for its brisk running time.  It's worth a look, and perhaps a purchase.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

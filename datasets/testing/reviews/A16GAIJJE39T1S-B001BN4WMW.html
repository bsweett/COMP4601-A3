<meta name="summary" content="Major abdominal surgery the hard way!"></head><body><p>A friend of mine at work gave me the VHS version of this movie soon after it first came out--in order to help entertain me while I was convalescing a home after a hospital stay.  It was indeed pretty entertaining with all the battles and so forth.  But the final part, where poor old Wallace is drawn and quartered was really too much for me--especially given the fact that what I had been subjected to in the hospital was major abdominal surgery!  To see all of those crude implements assembled and then applied to Gibson's character made me wince--especially with a few dozen surgical staples still holding my incision closed!  I really doubt that Wallace would have been able to articulate even the word "freedom" after having his guts mangled in such a way!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Predictable chick flick"></head><body><p>Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is a Hollywood producer who's just gotten her heart broken; Iris Simkins (Kate Winslet) lives in England and is also at the losing end of a romance.  Both ladies are miserable and decide to get away from home for Christmas.  They find each other on an online house-switch site and before you can say "I know how this is going to end!" Amanda is living in a cozy English cottage and Iris is ensconced in a luxurious LA mansion.  And you'll never guess what happens next.  (Okay, you will guess - in about half a minute.)<br /><br />Diaz, Winslet, and co-stars Jude Law and Jack Black are all fine here, looking beautiful and clever and giving sincere performances.  It's not their fault that the script is so predictable and corny with no room for WHY these new loves blossom so quickly, so blissfully, and so conveniently, considering the women are emotionally wounded and would need some time to heal and the men are not looking for relationships.  And what exactly are the odds of meeting your dream mate within hours of moving to a foreign country?  Eli Wallach gives a winning performance as a doddering old scriptwriter befriended by Iris, but again, it's all too perfect; there's no question that they will become instant buddies and that their lives will both be enriched by their friendship.<br /><br />If I were a woman in the 18-26 target group, I'd probably love this movie and even shed a few tears at it; as it is, I just kept thinking, "Well, there's five hours of my life I'll never get back."  (What?  It's only 136 minutes?  Impossible!  I thought it would never end.)</p></body></html>

Well, it's a little more thoughtful than that, and extremey well done. There are lots of issues being explored, and the wonderful script gives credence to a number of those issues: Corporate greed, parenting, young love, family situations, office cameraderie, etc. I enjoyed the film a lot. It's worth a look, especially at the end, which allows a smattering of justice and redemption.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dignified finale"></head><body><p>Although the news of Rocky's return was good for some laughs at first, I have to admit Sylvester Stallone managed to create a dignified finale for his boxing alter ego. Eventhough we have seen the same movie 6 times by now, Rocky Balboa's strength of being the underdog in every fight still works. Too bad part 5 of the Rocky series cannot be erased from everybody's minds forever. Rocky Balboa should have been part 5.(SARR)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Assault on Precinct 13"></head><body><p>With only a few hours left in the calendar year, Precinct 13, one of Detroit's oldest precinct houses, is closing. Amid heavy snowfall and unsafe road conditions, only a few lawmen remain on duty for New Year's Eve. They are headed by Sergeant Jake Roenick, a good cop wrestling with bad memories of a fatal undercover 'op' from the previous spring. The acting  in this movie is superb all the way through the cast. This movie is classic and airtight, a thriller that actually thrills you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Life goes on ..."></head><body><p>When people say that, it's usually meant to be somewhat encouraging.  The point of the saying being that tomorrow is a new day.  I'm not sure that people consider EXACTLY how painful that life &quot;going on&quot; can be.  This film explores that.<p>It's a film about how 3 different people, all connected in some way to a tragic car accident, deal with the guilt and pain of their lives continuing to move forward ... even when they can't bring themselves to move along with it.<p>The acting is absolutely SUPERB.  Sean Penn, realistically, could have won an Oscar for BOTH Mystic River and 21 Grams.  He's just OUTSTANDING.  Naomi Watts was also BRILLIANT as a wife and mother whose life is just DESTROYED when her family is killed.  Benico Del Toro, I'm convinced, is one of the most under-appreciated actors of the modern film world.  Even the second tier cast was outstanding.  Melissa Leo, for example, was incredible in the way she played a Lady MacBeth-ish wife to Del Toro's character.<p>The directing is wonderful.  The emotion that Alejandro I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu is able to get from his cast is staggering.  Its emotional impact on his audience is mind-blowing.  You'll find yourself tearing up watching Naomi Watts desperately trying to piece her shattered life back together.  I was a little confused in the beginning by the out-of-sequence method that was used in the films editing, but it breaks helps to give the audience a small emotional break (as another reviewer stated, this is a REALLY dark, sad film) and also makes for a better payoff as you fit the pieces of the film together to reveal the whole picture.<p>I can't possibly recommend this enough.  It is horribly depressing, but it's also an absolutely brilliant work of art.</p></body></html>

Gibson's character is depicted as a compassionate family man and an officer who vows to physically lead his men into battle.  When he arrives in Viet Nam, he and his inexperienced troops are sent on a mission which is almost doomed to failure because of the inequality of their numbers compared to the Vietnamese.  As the battle rages and men fall, scenes are shown of their wives receiving the telegrams which inform them of their husbands' deaths.  The viewer learns to care about these men and then sees many of them killed in combat.  This is a sad tribute to the heroes who died in that battle and those who survived to tell us the story.</p></body></html>

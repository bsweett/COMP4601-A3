<meta name="summary" content="Violent beyond my dreams....review of the 1983 version..."></head><body><p>This film has a couple of things against it.  It's a remake (I hate remakes), and it's directed by Brian de Palma, who has made a career of paying homage to Hitchcock and other directors a little too closely at times, but when he clicks, he can be electric.  This film is one of the most electric, intense, and violent films I ever saw.  It still has the same impact that it did when it was released.  It shows that remakes can be great.  This film is completely its own, really only using the title of the original and the same theme.  This film is far superior to the original, and is a work of art in many ways.  It has some of the most quotable dialogue ever written in a movie (is there a rap album out there that DOESN'T sample this movie), and everyone that has seen loves this film.  It had such an influence on hip-hop culture.  Kudos to Oliver Stone who wrote the screenplay (people sometimes forget about that) and de Palma for making such an excessive masterpiece.  The critics hated this when it came out (except, most notably, Roger Ebert), comparing it to The Godfather, and, of course, The Godfather won.  The Godfather was a completely different type of gangster movie.  It's still excellent, but this is on a completely different level.  Pacino should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for one of his best roles.  He had had a bad streak (Cruising, Bobby Deerfield, Author!, Author!), and many critics dumped on him for this.  They shouldn't.  This is probably his most memorable role, even though he's done great work elsewhere.  I'm tempted to put in a gratuitous rap reference right now, but I'll refrain.  Great filmmaking...</p></body></html>

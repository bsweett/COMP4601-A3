<meta name="summary" content="David Lean's Masterpiece with O''Toole's best acting"></head><body><p>I saw this classic many years ago when it first came out in 70 mm on a gigantic screen in San Francisco and was blown away.  Since then and periodically I have revisited this classic and have come to the conclusion that had David Lean never made another movie after this--he would still be considered one of the genius of cinema.  Keep in mind that this film influenced a young Steven Spielberg to enter the field of filmmaking (in fact he and Martin Scorsese had contributed to its restoration). And Peter O'Toole's debut performance is still one of the greatest ever captured on film!!  But that doesn't detract from the other fine actors in the cast such as the 74 yr old Claude Rains still vibrant, a brilliant Anthony Quinn, the cynical Arthur Kennedy as a disguised Lowell Thomas reporter and in his debut, Omar Sharif who becomes Lawrence's best friend and ally.  Aurally and visually arresting with much food for thought,"Lawrence Of Arabia" deserves to be in the top ten of great films that the AFI have designated along with "Godfather" and "Citizen Kane".</p></body></html>

In the near future, an assassination attempt on the US President by an unknown mutant triggers a vengeful military scientist's (Brian Cox) plot to destroy all mutants. Now to ensure their future, the X-Men must rely on the aid of new allies and old rivals to save millions of lives. "X2" is one of those rare sequels that actually succeed over the original. The 2004 summer blockbuster contains a complex but well-structured storyline, a top-notch cast and some strong emotional subplots. Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry and Ian McKellen deliver some fine performances. Hugh Jackman continues to superbly dominate the role of Wolverine and Alan Cummings is stunning as the gentle teleporting Nightcrawler. Director Bryan Singer adds much excitement in this sequel without diminishing the value of its story and characters. The action sequences and visual effects are quite amazing and a considerable improvement over the first film.<br /><br />If you thought that "X-Men 1.5" was a great DVD then you'll be pleasantly surprised with "X2: X-Men United" 2-Disc Widescreen Edition. The blockbuster sequel is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a fantastic video transfer with great resolution and rich colors. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is truly great but for a terrific home theater experience, the DTS audio track really delivers. The 2-Disc Widescreen Edition includes an audio commentary with director Brian Singer and production crew, a "Making of X2" documentary, 11 deleted scenes, photo galleries, theatrical trailers, 11 behind-the-scenes featurettes and colorful interactive menus. Overall, "X2: X-Men United" scores a solid "A".</p></body></html>

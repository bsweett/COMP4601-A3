<meta name="summary" content="a nice movie"></head><body><p>What makes Revolutionary Road stand out to me is the fact that, being patient and putting up with a relatively slow-moving storyline for the first 50% of it will gradually win you over by the time the movie has finished. I feel confident about this because there's a few twists and shockers at the end that I honestly never seen coming.  In order to appreciate these twists, you need to follow the entire film, even the boring parts.<br /><br />Let's be honest- the first half of Revolutionary Road is slow, boring, and almost pointless. The majority of the first half consists of a young couple (the man played by Leonardo DiCaprio) having big aspirations in life, and the wife encouraging the two of them to go and live in Paris permanently with their two children.<br /><br />Well, that never really happens because a bunch of obstacles come into the picture and cause a distraction for the young couple, one of them being that the wife is pregnant with another baby. As soon as we find out about the pregnancy, THIS is when the movie really picks up steam. An argument comes about, and then more problems follow suit. This all happens about halfway through the movie.<br /><br />The first half though... yikes. A VERY slow moving storyline this one has.<br /><br />Any time any mention of Leonardo DiCaprio's job position is mentioned, the storyline immediately sinks. This is just dull and uninspiring storytelling, and it's a horrible waste of time.<br /><br />Kathy Bates plays a nice, if somewhat unimportant part in the movie, and like always her scenes are absolutely golden. When she brings her troubled son over and he carries on conversations with the young couple and sticks his nose where it doesn't belong concerning the relationship problems the young couple is having... haha, BAD things happen. I won't spoil it though.<br /><br />This isn't a comedy- it's a drama with a twist at the end you need to see if you've been following the movie for the first half of it. It's a movie that tells a nice story, and that's about it.</p></body></html>

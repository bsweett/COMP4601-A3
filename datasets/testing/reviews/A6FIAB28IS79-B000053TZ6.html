<meta name="summary" content="Best DVD of all time?"></head><body><p>This restoration of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is nothing short of miraculous, practically as dazzling an achievement as the film itself. It's pretty well known that the original 35mm print of &quot;Kane&quot; was lost long ago, so expectations of producing a superior duplicate from another duplicate were never very high. On the film's 50th anniversary, Turner Enterprises released a restored print for theatrical release, but though it was brighter, it had a somewhat white-washed, softy-focused aura that served neither Welles' purpose nor the &quot;film noir-ish&quot; properties of Welles' masterpiece adequately.<p>The DVD restoration, on the other hand, has crisp, sharply-defined images, richly complex and nuanced blacks, whites and greys, and an audio track that sounds fresh and &quot;present&quot; without over-equalization of highs and lows or gratuitous stereo simulation. <p>For some viewers, &quot;Kane&quot; ranks as the greatest film of all time because it's possible to stop the film on any single frame of its 2-hour length and produce an exegesis not only on the aesthetic and technical strengths of that individual shot but on the film as a whole, given its organic structure and the microcosmic status of each of the parts. For such viewers, this version should prove especially indispensable, affording glimpses of information--faces and other objects formerly covered by dark shadow, lap dissolves once too subtle to spot even in slow motion, competing, yet independently crucial, conversations--perhaps not accessible since the film's initial release.<p>Even without the bonuses, the single disc would be worth the price. But the inclusion of an additional DVD, &quot;The Making of Citizen Kane,&quot; along with the historical, biographical, contextual materials included on the first disc make this package a steal.  With this many riches to choose from, viewers may be excused if they pass up the Peter Bogdanovich running commentary on the film (I couldn't stay with it for very long), but Roger Ebert's extemporary &quot;play-by-play&quot; is not merely profuse but perceptive, articulate, and edifying from the very first shot. Even his commentary during the gallery of stills, in which he explains why &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is his favorite movie and why it deserves its reputation as the best ever, is not to be missed. (I now realize that the hurried, superficial quality of much of his newpaper reviewing in recent years says more about the product than the reviewer.)<p>One caution: The first disc, with &quot;Kane&quot; and all of the assorted contextual material that follows, initially behaved &quot;buggy&quot; on my iMac DV. After disabling extensions, internet connections, and practically every other program except the DVD player, I was able to run the entire disc with no further problems.</p></body></html>

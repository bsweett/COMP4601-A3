<meta name="summary" content="Paz Vega breathes life into an otherwise mediocre movie"></head><body><p>I was pleasantly surprised by "Spanglish" and found myself enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. I would actually rate it 3 out of 5 stars if it weren't for the top-notch performance by Paz Vega, who IMO steals the show. By playing a maid, her role unfortunately does not break away from the stereotypical Hollywood role for a Latina actress. However, she is given so much screen time in this movie that she has every chance to breathe life into it, which she does in every scene she is in. And what's even better, having her take center stage lets her avoid getting swallowed up by the starpower of Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni and Cloris Leachman. Although I agree with other reviewers that this movie focuses a lot (perhaps even too much) on Deborah's neurosis, I think Flor is the one whom this movie is really about. After all, the movie is narrated from the first-person viewpoint of Flor's daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) who mainly talks about her mother's experiences with the family.<br /><br />In terms of the other performances, everyone does a credible job. Adam Sandler proves that he can take on a more serious role, although there were certain scenes when I almost expected him to suddenly go slapstick on us. The only scene that I found pointless is when Tea Leoni climaxes on top of Sandler with her clothes on. This scene was majorly out of place in the movie and was rather stupid and unfunny.<br /><br />All in all, "Spanglish" is a movie that would be fairly run-of-the-mill if it weren't for the injected Latin flavor of Paz Vega, who spices things up and makes it worth seeing. This is her first major blockbuster movie in the American market, and now that she has gotten the exposure she needs, I hope she can continue to have success with her future projects.</p></body></html>

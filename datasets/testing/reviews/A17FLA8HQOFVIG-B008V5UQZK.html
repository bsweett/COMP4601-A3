<meta name="summary" content="A few giggles, but no tension at all and predictible plot"></head><body><p>The only reason I finally succumbed to seeing this film was because it became such a big hit.  I usually avoid romantic comedies though and find them boring.  Well, frankly, this was no exception.  I do admire the star though, Nia Vardalos, who wrote the screenplay which she adapted from her successful one-woman show.<p>This is the story of a 30-year-old Greek-American woman who finds love with a nice looking non-Greek man.  From the opening scene the plot of the story was obvious.  And even though there were a few giggles because of the exaggerated ethnic extended family, there was not one bit of tension.  There are no conflicts between the lovers.  And the only bump in the road is her family, which doesn't seem to be any kind of real impediment - especially since the title of the film is a dead giveaway as to the final outcome.<p>O.K., I did watch the film all the way through.  Sometimes I even smiled at some of the predictable jokes.  But it was much too simple for my taste.  I'm sorry, but I can only give My Big Fat Greek Wedding the mildest of lukewarm recommendations.</p></body></html>

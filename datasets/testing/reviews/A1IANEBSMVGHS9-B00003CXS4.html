<meta name="summary" content="One of those simply brilliant movies"></head><body><p>Guy Richie, Snatch's director, for those who don't know it is Madonna's husband. This was basically all I knew when I saw the movie the first time. This, and a very good recommendation from a peer at work. <p> What I found was a movie that is simply brilliant. It is filled with some of the funniest scenes you have seen in a long time (top-notch humor, the type of Saturday Night Live, but British-style), and therefore deals in that way with a whole ganster-like plot with originally many separate threads, which are progressively combined in a very smart way, much like the maestro Tarantino would do. <p> If you enjoyed &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (Richie's first movie) you'll love this one. If you haven't seen it, after you see Snatch, you'll die to see it and will love it every bit as much. Richie uses again a large part of the same cast from the first movie (including the main star, Jason Statham).  <p> The only thing I regretted was that Del Toro did not play a more important role in the movie. But then again, Pitt's rendition of the impossible-to-understand-yet-incredibly-funny gipsy was a sample of sheer genius!</p></body></html>

On one hand, Hereafter is a thought-provoking study on how different people handle their lives and life after death. On the other hand, it's a bitter disappointment when you consider the talent involved. However you feel in the end, Hereafter certainly does warrant at least one watch, if anything to see why there is such a division amongst viewers. The score is a depressing one. It sounds a lot like Unforgiven's in ways, and all of the actors are as depressing as the subject matter. They do a pretty good job at portraying the pain, grief, and all around hollowness caused by the death of a loved one. It's definitely well-acted, and the cinematography is pretty good as well. Dark and ominous are the best words to describe this one. It's a somber affair. That's obvious when considering the subject matter of the focal point of the three stories that the film revolves around. If you know me and my reviewing style, you know I hate to summarize plot, but I'll say that the three stories build up to an intersection that does absolutely nothing for the audience, or at least it did nothing for me.<br /><br />You feel for the characters throughout the story, but when they cross paths (after about two slow hours), you are left with a longing. I felt like Eastwood just ran out of story, so he wrapped it up abruptly. *Spoiler* And for a film that is so sad and depressing, the generic Hollywood happy ending pissed me off. Also, the opening sequence looked like something from 2012. Cars flipping down the street, trees falling, explosions in the background, and chaos. Don't get me wrong, it is a good sequence, but it just reminded me of 2012. My major complaint about this movie is that it really just left me feeling unfulfilled. I didn't take anything away from this, not a positive way to sum it up. I can't even explain why they took a supernatural route with it. The "Herafter" parts were pretty hokey. I didn't like The Lovely Bones either, but I'd consider watching that one again before this. I'm truly disappointed, but see it if you like Clint Eastwood. Just don't expect too much.</p></body></html>

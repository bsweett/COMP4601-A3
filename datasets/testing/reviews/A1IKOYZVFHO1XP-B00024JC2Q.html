<meta name="summary" content="Stiller and Wilson in awesome action!"></head><body><p>Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson delighted audiences in early 2004 with a theatrical version of the television classic that starred Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. Great supporting performance by Snoop Dogg. These guys are going after the bad boys and scoring with the hot girls. Awesome film!</p></body></html>

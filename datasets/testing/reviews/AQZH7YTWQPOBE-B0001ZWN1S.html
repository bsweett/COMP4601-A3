<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest movies in cinema history"></head><body><p>The Godfather is the quintessential example of a movie classic that has survived and thrived in the 20th century. Unlike some classics (such as Citizen Kane), The Godfather is just as relevant to modern viewers as it was 40 years ago. The movie does look a bit grainy, but far from distracting the grain gives the movie a 1950s look appropriate to the era.<br /><br />The characterization is absolutely engrossing. Far more than almost any other film I can think of, The Godfather creates complex characters with genuinely ambiguous morals. The movie is never so fascicle as to treat any of the characters as good or evil, heroes or villains. The film never depicts the "mafia" as a whole is good or evil, but rather shows the tensions and moral compromises of life in the moral grey zone. By the end of the movie, you're not quite sure whether you should feel sorry for the Corleones or hate them.<br /><br />Rather than go on ad nauseum about about how much I love this movie, I'll just end by noting that this is perhaps the only movie that came out before 1973 - except perhaps Lawrence of Arabia - that general audiences will continue to watch in another 40 years.</p></body></html>

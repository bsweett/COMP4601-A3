It's not groundbreaking, or worth all the hype, but it's entertaining, and that's all that really matters.  And at 90 minutes, it avoids the cardinal sin of outlasting its welcome.<br /><br />I never thought Jennifer Garner was a good actress, but she is excellent in this film.  I don't know if it was the direction or the script, but she walks the knife edge between being sympathetic and domineering perfectly.  And Jason Bateman plays a different character than he usually does.  Sadly, for fans of Arrested Development, he doesn't have a single scene with Michael Cera.  Cera isn't in this movie very much, but he is great whenever he's in a scene.  Who would have thought he would turn out to be the big breakout movie star of Arrested Development?<br /><br />On the downside, the dialogue is often a bit too cutesy and precious for its own good, especially toward the beginning of the movie.  And, like all movies with teenagers, the characters don't act like real teenagers.  Nonetheless, my wife (who works at a high school) says that "Juno" gets closer than a lot of movies to what teenagers are actually like.<br /><br />I'd recommend "Juno" as a rental.  It's worth seeing, but you're unlikely to want to add this to your permanent collection.</p></body></html>

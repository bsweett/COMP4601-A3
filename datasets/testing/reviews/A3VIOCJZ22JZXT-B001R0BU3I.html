The film is held together by a great performance by Don Cheadle as Samir Horn, a Sudanese born Islamic American citizen. Guy Pierce gives a great performance as an FBI agent on the trail of Horn. The film also uses the story of Samir Horn as a character study of a complex individual. The FBI agent played by Guy Pierce serves as a proxy for the viewer for as Pierce fits the pieces of the puzzle together, so also does the viewer. Pierce is the proxy for the viewer unraveling the actions, loyalties, and deeper motivations of a complex man who may or may not be suffering from conflicting values and cultural systems.<br /><br />Much of the action revolves around the cat and mouse dynamics of terrorism and counter-terrorism. However, it is the character study that balances the action that makes this film get 4 stars. The film presents us with the ambiguity as to whether Samir is a rogue secret agent who has become a terrorist or whether Samir is a double agent who is out on a thin limb as he infiltrates an organization of terrorists with little if any back-up. Thus the concept of 'traitor' is part of the dynamics for we are not certain as to whether he is a traitor to the US or whether he is a traitor to Islam. The resolution of the conflict could be viewed as contrived Hollywood wrap-up, but give the film a break for even though it tries to explore complex issues working inside the mind of a complex mind, the film must also deliver entertainment with no strings left hanging. On this account it certainly delivers.</p></body></html>

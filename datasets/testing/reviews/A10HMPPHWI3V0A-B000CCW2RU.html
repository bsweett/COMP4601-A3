It definatly was not the lack of big name stars (it had Ewan Mcgregor & Scarlett Johanson...) or the asumed work of an unknown director (it was directed by widley known Director, Micheal Bay) and there was no way the people didnt go see it because of a lack of suspence or action! (it had a budget of around 120 million, most of which was spent on special effects and/or action...). Overall though if you really take a look, it was not that the film did'nt do well, because it did (grossing 160 million) but I really cant figure out why the United States only contributed to 35 million of that? I think that it is just that the box office is completely up in the air and can even be somewhat random..., there have been some major Box-office bombers, the most recent being Poseidon which lost tons, there have also been some films that have a budget of near nothing that gross over 100 million (some recent ones being Saw 2, March Of the Penguins and Napolean Dynamite).<br /><br />"The Island", though somewhat confusing and slow at the get go, really starts to speed in what makes for an excellent big-budget action adventure. The leading roles starring McCgregor & Johanson are very well played and the supporting cast does a decent job as well. Though it can appear to be somewhat jumbled as well as puzzling at the beginning it really comes together well. I thought that there was some very clever ideas and some comic relief throughout.<br /><br />Though I am sure alot of you dont know alot about the film, it is actaully quite well done and very smart. It could compete with several others for the honor of Best action flick of the Summer.<br /><br />Not Flawless but definatly worth a look.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

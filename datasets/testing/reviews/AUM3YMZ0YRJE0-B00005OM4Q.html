<meta name="summary" content="This is neither hokey nor trite, but achingly real and exciting"></head><body><p>For a long time, I thought that this was another one of those silly romantic comedies - afterall, that was the section it was in.  I thought, why bother with another coming of age movie that will end up stupidly happy, with the wrong lessons, and puerily unrealistic.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong on that one!!  This is a wonderful, sensitive film that develops a number of themes:  finding a mentor, making your first foray into the world, discovering what (relative) failures most of us are as people, and of course, the decline of rock in the 1970s.  Not only was the psychology of the characters subtle and realistic, but the evocation of the time - when the 60s idealism gave way to crass commercialism and, well, genuine mediocrity - is vivid and accurate.<br /><br />I am almost the exact same age as the protagonist, so I identified with him on many levels:  rebelling against a parent he loved to go his own way, accomplishing something original by getting inside with his own talent and gall, and seeing the people behind the idols of cool.  It is amazingly successful at all this, and for kids there is a lot to learn from it.  Heck, even I re-wrote my life somewhat while enjoying this adventure of youth!  It is lovely, sad, and uplifting.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is a great director.</p></body></html>

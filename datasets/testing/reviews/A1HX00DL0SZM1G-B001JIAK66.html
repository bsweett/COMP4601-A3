<meta name="summary" content="Homage will leave you breathless with excitement"></head><body><p>In 1999 director Steven Sommers presented the hit movie THE MUMMY to movie audiences (which opened to an amazing weekend take of $43 million May 7th). With so much success a sequel THE MUMMY RETURNS (2001) was inevitable.<br />Sommers, a big fan of the classic Universal monster/horror movies made the movie as a homage to the earlier Universal movies and in 2004 he paid tribute to the other staples of the genre -Wolfman, Dracula and Frankenstein's monster - all in one movie. The movie VAN HELSING even had Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde in a cameo role at the outset of the movie fighting famed monster hunter Van Helsing - portrayed by Hollywood star Hugh Jackman.<br />Ignore what you may have read or heard about the movie, it's a thrill ride of a rollercoaster of a movie that owes more than a tip of the hat to both the Indiana Jones and James Bond franchises. The movie never lets up, traveling along at breakneck speed right to its tumultuous, suspenseful, wrist-clenching climax.<br />The movie opens in 1887 and follows legendary vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing as he travels to the mysterious land of Transylvannia - home to his most famed opponent Count Dracula and a land that has been overrun by werewolves and vampires.<br />Prior to his departure we have a scene unabashedly influenced by the Q-scenes from the James Bond series. Equipped with such `futuristic' weaponry and gadgets as an automatic `machine gun' style crossbow, Van Helsing, with comic relief Carl (played by David Wenham) as his bumbling assistant in tow, heads to investigate the reports coming out of eastern Europe.<br />Upon arrival Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious (played by the impossibly gorgeous Kate Beckinsale). Valerious is the last member of a family that is under a curse that can only be broken by the death of Dracula. After some initial mistrust Valerious realizes that Van Helsing shares her goal of defeating the evil count and the two enter into an alliance.<br />I admit that my initial interest in the movie was sparked by the involvement of Beckinsale. A fan of the British actress since I noticed her alongside Clare Danes in BROKEDOWN PALACE, I have enjoyed a number of her movies (SEREDIPITY and UNDERWORLD) and had to endure some terrible movies (PEARL HARBOR and TIPTOES). Thankfully VAN HELSING falls squarely in the positive column and ranks unquestionably as my favorite Beckinsale movie to date. She gives an excellent and stirring performance as a determined fighter of the monsters that inhabit her land.<br />Opposing Van Helsing, Carl and Valerious is one of the all-time best screen portrayals of Dracula in Richard Roxburgh. Roxburgh is simply superb and steals every scene he is in with his deliciously evil rockstar take on the character. Aiding Dracula are his three vampire brides (Josie Maran, Silvia Colloca and Elena Anaya) who fly around the country doing his bidding - the interplay between the three I found to be constantly entertaining. Also under the spell of the count is Wolf man (Will Kemp), a character Van Helsing has sworn to kill, but one which causes some emotional drama for Valerious and an interesting subplot for the movie.<br />With a budget of $148 million, Universal really threw a lot of effort into this movie and it shows. A total of 980 special effects accompanies some well honed action scenes, amazing stunts and sumptious costume design in a movie that really delivers the goods. It's an incredible trip that will leave you breathless until the end credits roll.<br />This movie was criticized widely for its improbable script. Yes, it's a B-movie script but then it is supposed to be. It's a homage to the black and white Universal classics. That's what you go expecting to see, only with updated special effects and a larger budget. In those respects this movie is a triumph. Sit back and enjoy and remember those wonderful Lon chaney and Bela Lugosi movies of yesteryear. This movie isn't one that works if you try to overthink it. It's fun and played to be fun.<br />Delivering possibly two of their best performances is Jackman and Beckinsale and I really felt a chemistry between the stars, easily more so than Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in the two MUMMY movies. Sommers sets his story against a spectacular scenic backdrop that worked for me as far more breathtaking than  the desert vistas of Sommers most famous earlier work.<br />VAN HELSING is an achievement and my favorite movie of 2004. I am eagerly awaiting the release of the widescreen anamorphic DVD on Oct. 19 in a release that Universal has understandably seen fit to shower with special features. Including two audio commentaries, a 360-degree tour of Dracula's castle, You are in the Movie, the tantalizingly titled `The Legend of Van Helsing' and (perhaps most enticing) some deleted scenes, October cannot come soon enough.<br />I'm hoping for a VAN HELSING 2, but even if one doesn't get made at least I will have this immensely entertaining movie to enjoy.<br />Well recommended.<br /> Be aware that the studio will also be releasing an Ultimate Edition DVD on the same day. This three-disc set will also include the classic horror movies DRACULA (1931), FRANKENSTEIN (1931) and THE WOLF MAN (1941).<br />Other special features included on the Ultimate Edition are: 'VAN HELSING, THE STORY, THE LIFE THE LEGEND'; 'TRACK THE ADVENTURE: VAN HELSING'S MAP'; 'THE MUSIC OF VAN HELSING' and 'DARKNESS FALLS: DRACULA'S LAIR IS TTRANSFORMED.'<br /> Which ever version you pick up, the regular edition or the Ultimate Edition be assured that you will be well pleased with the movie itself - a must-own!</p></body></html>

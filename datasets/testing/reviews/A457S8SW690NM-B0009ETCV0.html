The plot is very complex and you might be confused at times but, you have to show patience to understand it. The movie starts with my man Bruce with a nice hair due while he is a negotiator. But when things go awry and the hostages get killed, one a child, Bruce Willis's character named Jeff Talley quits the force and becomes hief of police in a very small town. This is a change from big Los Angeles. He's married, and has a daughter there. But, just when he thinks that things are going to be very calm, it ends up being very hectic. When three young punks break into a large mansion and when one of them kills a cop and shoots at other cops, there's a situation. Inside the giant mansion, there's one man with two children. The mansion alone is neat to observe as it's so big and has so many hidden places. It's absolutely gorgeous and that alone is amazing. But, Jeff Talley is the guy in charge and he negotiates with the 3 guys that have broken into the house.<br /><br />But, things get worse for Jeff when mysterious men inform him that they'll execute his wife and child if he doesn't retrieve a disc from the mansion in which unfortunately 3 intruders are already in. Talley is going to have to decide between his family or the other one's. Of course, Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis and you'll just have to wait what's going to happen. The movie packs some thrills and some action scenes in the mansion are awesome. For one, there are lots of molotov cocktails and this movie ends up being an origianl and absolutely amazing experience. Beleive me, I thought that this would be a very average movie but boy was I surprised. The thrills are real thrills and some scenes are just freaky. The last scene is a great finale with some great action. This action/thriller is definitely one that no one should miss out on.</p></body></html>

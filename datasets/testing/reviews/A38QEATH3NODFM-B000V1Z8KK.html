<meta name="summary" content="Great blend of camera work and effects, good film."></head><body><p>Many of the other reviewers have given the plot summary, I just will say that this is a decent action film. Great camera work and nice effects.  The only thing I had to that was a flaw was the fact that indeed, his friend was killed in Ethopia on a top secret mission when they were left for dead. And yes it left his widow and family grieving.  But where does this justify after getting caught up in a big cover up shooting and killing so many people.  Does that justify the outcome.  In this movie, no.  What did it prove, a corrupt senetor, and an aged evil secret agent (danny glover).  So, bottom line, don't overthink this one, just watch it for the great camera and effects work.</p></body></html>

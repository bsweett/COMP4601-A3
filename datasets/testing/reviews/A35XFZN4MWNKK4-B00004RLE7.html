<meta name="summary" content="CLASSIC ACTION-THRILLER"></head><body><p>A powerful, action movie which keeps you in suspense throughout! Bruce Willis plays a cop who battles with terroists who have taken over the building where his wife and children are. The visual effects are stunning, dialogue fast and very sharp and as always a great, beleavable performance from Bruce Willis. Amongst the rest of the cast include bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alan Rickman and Paul Gleason. One of the best action movies i've seen. A definite classic! Highly recommended!!!!!</p></body></html>

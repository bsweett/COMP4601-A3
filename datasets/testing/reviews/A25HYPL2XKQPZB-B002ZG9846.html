<meta name="summary" content="Kick-Ass is a fun and original movie."></head><body><p>Matthew Vaughn's KICK-ASS is adapted from a comic book from the same name. Seems like there are tons of movies being made from comics these days, and, except for Spiderman, Superman, etc., I imagine the vast majority of film-goers aren't familiar with the comics these movies are based on.<br /><br />For a movie like this to be successful, it has to appeal to the non-comic book fan. To me, Kick-Ass is an awesome movie, a great superhero origin tale. High school nerd Dave Lizewski  has always dreamed of being a superhero. So, one day he buys a costume, puts it on, and then goes out to fight crime.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about the movie. I enjoyed the pulsating soundtrack set to scenes of gory, stylized violence. I loved the cast. Nicholas Cage is at his best. Clarke Duke is the funny sidekick. Mark Strong is the great villain. Lyndsy Fonseca is the beautiful girlfriend. Aaron Johnson even shines as Dave/Kick-Ass. Chlo? Grace Moretz, the young teenager, playing Hit-Girl was the surprise of the film, as well as the center of controversy. Seems some people didn't care to see a young girl get beat up, use foul language, and kill dozens. Come on, lighten up. This is a fun movie, not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Movies like Kick-Ass are so much better than some of the stuff coming out of Hollywood these days. Because of the extreme violence and bad language, this movie isn't for everyone. But, its funny, clever and a lot of fun. I can't wait for the sequel.</p></body></html>

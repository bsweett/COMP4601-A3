Script contributions by Sylvester Stallone. Based on the novel by David Morrell. Makeup by Michael Westmore. Score by Jerry Goldsmith.<br /><br /> Starring Sylvester Stallone, Brian Dennehy, David Caruso and Richard Crenna.<br /><br /> A former Green Beret and Vietnam War veteran named John Rambo traumatized by both the War and his treatment when he returned home, alone and alienated, finally snaps when a Sheriff of a small Northwestern town, thinking him just another hippie vagrant up to no good, inadvertantly pushes him over the edge.<br /><br /> Taking to the woods, Rambo begins a guerilla war against the town and the local national guard while the sheriff, realizing that this is all his fault, tries to somehow make it right. At the same time, Rambo's former commander arrives to end this before things get too serious.<br /><br /> While not at all a fan of this film's immediate sequel, one must concede that the original is a particularly fine film with a surprising courage and insight. Dennehy's sheriff could easily have been a one note villain ala SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT but he instead gives him an unexpected depth and some sympathy. While the initial mistake is his, things become as bad as they do because of incompetent or vicious subordinants who do not follow his orders. The sheriff is to be faulted for not allowing Rambo's commander to peacefully resolve things by "letting it go" but his response does have some validity as well. Is Dennehy intended to represent Lyndon Johnson?? Stallone give a very good performance as Rambo---not at all the caricature that his critics like to portray him as being. Stallone runs the gamut from a walking wound to a crazed super soldier before finally descending--in a moving scene---to emotional collapse and is excellent throughout.<br /><br /> The film is loathed by the usual suspects for its sympathetic portrayal of an American soldier and for utterly shattering the drug addled, drunken homosexual racist Nazi rapist babykiller smear(though reviewers like to portray the Rambo films as being made for repressed homosexuals, that is not present in the films) and returning him to his proper place as hero and a victim of the Left's virulent Commie propaganda. However this loathing is not justified by the film---which face it... is simply asking for some sympathy and understanding-- but rather by the seething Hate that underlies the Left.<br /><br /> The film, as supposedly "right wing propaganda," is a pretty soft soap bubble and is generally balanced and decent. It is fairly well directed, very nicely photographed and the score is quite good.<br /><br /> I liked it.<br /><br /> So have me liguidated.<br /><br /> God bless our troops.</p></body></html>

He's a friar who since he was little loved the game of Luchadore (Did I spell that right? I hope) wrestling. He cant love anything that is forbidden she he is a man of God but all he wants to do is get recognized and accomplish his dream. He becomes a friend with Esqueleto played by Hector Jimenez as the train to compete in different tag team Luchadore wrestling matches. They get paid for losing but it gives Nacho money to give the Orphan kids better quality food then the other stuff he serves them. Nacho falls in love with Sister Encarnacion played by the lovely Ana de la Reguero (Gitanas, Ladies Night) as he tries to impress her and all that stuff. Cesar Gonzalez plays Ramses, a great champion Luchadore wrestler who is powerful and famous and who Nacho has to fight down the line. Directed by Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess who also wrote it too. Jack Black is down right hilarious as Nacho. The accent fades in and out sometimes but I was cracking up and Jack Black pulled it off nicely. Especially when he sang that song he wrote for the Sister. It has some crude moments being it PG but I enjoyed it. Peter Stormare (Armageddon, Constantine) has a small small part as Emperor in the scene where Nacho has to climb up to drink the yoke from the bird egg. I was disapponted he was only in that scene and not in others. I would of loved a cameo by Napoleon or Pedro. Especially Pedro! A villager should of had a "Vote for Pedro" t-shirt on. "I was wondering if you would like to join me in my quarters this night... for some toast"</p></body></html>

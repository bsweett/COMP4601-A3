<meta name="summary" content="A raw  (and realistic)  look at addictions."></head><body><p>The acting in this movie is AWESOME !!!<br />The film revolves around 4 people.<br />The characters are Ellen Burnstein (who plays the mom) Her son(Jared Leto), her son's best friend(Marlon Wayans), and her son's girlfriend(Jennifer Connely).<br /><br />The son and friend start out selling drugs, and become thier own best customers,the girlfriend also becomes addicted, followed by the Mom.She starts taking prescribed diet pills to lose weight, because she believes that she is going to appear on a talk show and wants to fit in a particular red dress, and her 'dieting' does start out innocent enough.<br /><br /> As this movie progresses we watch them become empty shells of who they used to be throughout a one year time period, as thier addictions progress.<br />(The film is shot in 4 parts, 4 seasons:Winter,Spring,Summer and Fall)It starts in the spring and<br />by the time Winter comes around, they are all living in thier personal hells as full blown addicts. Mom on her "legal" prescription speed, and the other 3 on Herion.<br /><br />The acting in this film is top rank.<br />I think it is right on the money the depths to which these four sink.<br />Addiction is not a pretty thing,and even though the empty shells of the addicts they become is disgusting to watch, it is also hard to turn away.<br /><br />The Mother's "bottom" that she hits in her addiction will make you cry, you just have to see it to believe it. And I felt the most sorry for her character too, because she was so naive' and  innocent when she began taking the prescribed diet pills, and because they WERE prescribed, she didn't see anything wrong with her use, and it continued until she was a raving lunatic at about 70 pounds, and getting shock treatments.<br /><br />We witness all 4 characters in thier spiral downward, and it is very sad to see.<br /><br />I will have to say that it is about the most depressing movie I ever saw, but this is not totally a bad thing, as there is a lesson to be learned, and that lesson is that no matter who you are,rich or poor, black or white, girl or guy: ANYone can become an addict.<br />Some make it back from the bottom, and others don't.<br />That is the reality of the situation, and this movie captures that perfectly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An unnecessarily confusing movie about guilt"></head><body><p>This movie can easily confuse the heck out of anyone... It takes a while to pick up the storyline, and even once you do figure out how the lives of Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn and Naomi Watt get connected (much in the same style as in the director's outstanding movie, "Amores Perros"), there are still ends that are not easy to tie until later... much later. By the end of the movie it becomes somewhat evident that the core of the story is about how the protagonists deal with their own guilts and internal demons.<br /><br />As much as I loved the cinematography, the performances of the three leads and the overall feel of the movie (much assisted too by Gustavo Santaolalla's magical musical touch), and as much as I am into non-linear filmmaking, after a while you get a bit tired of the jumping back and forth. Specially since it doesn't build up in a way that is compelling enough and ends up taking away from the core message. You feel before the movie is half way through that there's no good reason for resorting to telling the story in this way, or that the editing work was not effective enough.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie, but far from "Amores Perros", I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's cinematic accomplishment to date. I give it three stars mostly for the performances and the movie's overall feel. But other than that, I feel the use of non-linear storytelling complicated things unnecessarily and threw it off in a loop.</p></body></html>

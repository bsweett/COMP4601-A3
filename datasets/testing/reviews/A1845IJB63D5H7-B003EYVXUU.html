<meta name="summary" content="Created a new friendly rule for a vampire."></head><body><p>The blood sucking and vampire aspects of the movie blended well with the loneliness and helplessness of a young child. You would walk out of the movie believing that the helpless child viewed impoverished and strange people as vampires and benefited from their greater suffering in alleviating his.<br /><br />The mother of the child remained anonymous and faceless. The father remained remote and disinterested. Thus, the lone child has to face life by making his own image of what life should be. His neighbors are isolated and remote. His only encounter was a girl who has no traceable past, does not know her real age, never went to school, poor, and expresses strange senses of never feeling cold. In the school, the lone child is bullied by ruthless kids and could not gather his strength to ward off aggression.<br /><br />The movie then shows multiple murders by the father of the neighbor and impoverished girl. It was not clear whether those murders were mere speculation by the lone child after he grew up or were mere guessing to frame the strange and secretive neighbor.<br /><br />"Let me in" sounded mutual. The lone boy needed someone to talk to and share. The strange and impoverished neighbor has something to offer. She advised the feeble and defenseless boy to fight back when others bully him. Thus, the two kids could share, one was desperate for friendship, the other for normality. The strange neighbor girl sounded as an extraterrestrial creature within the norms of the lone boy. His mind perceived her as the savior vampire who could help him fight back the aggressors. The perceived vampire permeated into the mind of the lone boy as the savior in moments of extreme fear. She sucked the blood of others, climbed trees and buildings faster than chimpanzees, but harbored love and friendship towards him.<br /><br />How such scenario related to the the year 1982, New Mexico, or to Ronald Reagan's presidency, is obscure to me.</p></body></html>

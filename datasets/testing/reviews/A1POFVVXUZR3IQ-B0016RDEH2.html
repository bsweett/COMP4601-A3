<meta name="summary" content="The Labyrinth of the Faun"></head><body><p>Pan's Labyrinth is a fairytale for grown-ups, and what a beautiful movie...it follows the life of a young girl, Ofelia [played by a talented young actress, Ivana Baquero] who is forced to leave the city and move to the Spanish countryside together with her expectant mother on the orders of her stepfather, Captain Vidal, a monstrous brute with no human compassion whatsoever. Ofelia's feelings of alienation provides the setting for her entry into the magical underworld of the labyrinth, where she meets a faun who reveals her 'true' identity, an ancient princess of the underworld who needs to complete three tasks in order to reclaim her position. So we have Ofelia coping with the demands set upon her by the faun, and in the real world, we witness Spain's Civil War, with the Captain ruthlessly hunting down dissidents. There are great supporting roles here played by the housekeeper Mercedes who is also helping the rebels, the doctor who treats Ofelia's mother [also aids the rebels], and of course the magical beings that inhabit Ofelia's alternate world. Some of these beings are scary [the baby eating monster for example], but nothing is as scary as the real world inhabited by cruel humans...the Captain's predilection for torture makes for wince-inducing viewing. The cinematography evokes a magical world a la Alice in Wonderland, whilst also showing the stark realities of war. Unlike some of the other reviews, I actually thought the fantasy and real elements merged together quite well...especially where it concerned Ofelia's attempts to help her ill, expectant mother. I did wish that more time had been spent on developing the fantasy element in the story...it just felt like there was a lot more to be said concerning Ofelia's exploration of the 'other' world. As for the score, it is simply haunting. This is definitely an adult movie because of the excessive and graphic violence, and also the frightening images both in the real and imaginary realm. Del Toro has directed a masterpiece that bears repeated viewing.</p></body></html>

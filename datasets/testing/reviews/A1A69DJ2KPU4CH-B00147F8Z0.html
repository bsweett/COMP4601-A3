Answer: AVP Requiem.<br /><br />Acting ranges from mediocre to atrocious. There is not a single character you care about because none of them are developed, and most of them are incredibly annoying 20 somethings who I wouldn't care to see developed anyway. The script is ridiculously bad, with such howlers as "the government doesn't lie." There is nothing special about the special effects either. The predator/alien hybrid is cool, but it's really hard to see it most of the time. And folks, therein lies the biggest problem with this movie, it's unbelievably dark; comically so. It is difficult to impossible to tell what is happening on screen for 90% of the movie. I'm okay with using darkness to provide atmosphere, but this movie takes darkness to a whole new level. It's by far the darkest shot movie I have ever seen (and I've seen lots, and lots of movies), and is a major annoyance and deterrence to any enjoyment one might gleam from this flick. How did this movie make it to post production without anyone involved in its creation not complaining about how dark it is? Or maybe they did and no one listened? I watched the Blu-ray version on a Panasonic DMP-BDT220 player and a perfectly calibrated Vizio E371VL TV, and I know it's not my equipment that is at fault. It's just one big, dark mess of a movie that frustrates endlessly.<br /><br />The plot such as it is really isn't too bad on paper, but the other flaws render the movie unwatchable in this reviewer's opinion. I'm really still waiting for a good AVP movie, as this one and the previous one both stunk (although you could actually see what was happening in the first AVP). I would love to see a director of the caliber of a James Cameron, Ridley Scott, or Peter Jackson make a stab at a 3rd AVP, but sadly it's doubtful that will ever happen. The end of AVP Requiem leaves the movie open to a sequel, but it's been five years since this stinker of a movie hit theaters, and due to it's poor showing and poor reviews, it's highly unlikely the movie studios will take a chance on a third.</p></body></html>

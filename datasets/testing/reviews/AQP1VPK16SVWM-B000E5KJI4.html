<meta name="summary" content="Petersen's epic does the trick"></head><body><p>Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to make an effective epic. It took a talented guy from downunder (Peter Jackson "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy)to demonstrate that taking a risk can pay off big time. Wolfgang Petersen's epic "Troy" although flawed, captures the epic flavor of Homer's tale with strong performances, visual effects that are truly stunning in their recreation of ancient Greece and a literate script. While "Troy' isn't a perfect epic, it battles successfully against monumental expectations and comes away bloodied but still standing.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does a fine job as the proud and arrogant Achilles. I found no fault with his accent at all. After all, you have an international cast here with a variety of accents. When I last checked we were still pretty sure that the Greeks of the time didn't speak with English accents. Does it matter if his accent fits in? Not really as his performance more than makes up for that issue.  What matters here is whether or not the actor captured the flavor of the character. Pitt aquits himself quite well. Every bit his equal are Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and veteran Brian Cox (the original Hannibal Lector). Sean Bean turns in an all too brief performance as Odysseus. The women characters do get short changed but that's not a surprise as this really focuses on the battles.  Peter O'Toole appears as King Priam and does a fine job in a limited role as well (although O'Toole hated working with Petersen so much he still hasn't seen the film). Diane Kruger turns heads as Helen of Troy. I've heard complaints about her performance and must say that she makes Helen a much more complex and real character than I thought possible.<br /><br />The script written by David Benioff isn't without its flaws. The film strays quite a bit from Homer's Iliad but when it does most of the time the changes work. Petersen's use of CGI expands the action rather than subtracting from it. In fact in one of the featurettes one of the CGI artists mentions that they had to convince Petersen to take some of the ships out the footage (compare the trailer to the finished product)as the way they were spread out it just wouldn't be believable.  While capturing the epic flavor of classic Hollywood films, the characters could have been a bit better developed than they were. Other than that, the dialogue provides witty entertainment particularly when Ageamemnon and Achilles trade barbed remarks.<br /><br />The disc looks exceptionally good with vivid colors and blacks darker than black coffee. The images sport exceptionally good clarity and sharpness. The anamorphic widescreen transfer looked like the better of the two particulary for a widescreen TV but both versions excel. The powerful battles for your attention with the intense visual sequences that Petersen has created.<br /><br />The extras include a number of very cool featurettes including "Troy: An Effects Odyssey", "Gallery of the God: A 3D animated guide to Greek myths and a really good featurette looking at the battle sequences. "From Ruins to Reality" also discusses the production design of the film and the challenges to recreating the past. This two disc set has both the feature film (spread over a dual layer single disc)with the special features located on the second disc of the film. There's no commentary track.</p></body></html>

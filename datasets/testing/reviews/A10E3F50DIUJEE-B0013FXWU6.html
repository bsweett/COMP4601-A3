<meta name="summary" content="I thought it was just wonderful"></head><body><p>I really feel this movie, although it could be slow at times, was quite good.  The acting was great, the cinematography was just stunning, and the story was compelling.<br /><br />The last 30 minutes of the film are my favorite--so intense!<br /><br />I realize this is not a "blockbuster" movie where everyone could easily enjoy it.  But if you like Paul Thomas Anderson, this movie will please you.  If you haven't seen this movie (or his other films), I advise you to rent it before you buy it, and keep an open mind.<br /><br />Sadly the greeting card style "case" (using that term kindly) was flimsy and I needed to get another plastic case so the DVD would not become damaged.  But that is my only complaint.  (*Note, I did NOT buy the special edition.)</p></body></html>

Period music, costumes, and a bold, intrusive shooting style help evoke a heady, secret world of crime without consequences, a world bound to implode. Liotta is strangely sympathetic and all-too-human as Hill, DeNiro frighteningly combustible as Jimmy, and Pesci electrifying as the savage, psychotic Tommy (he nabbed an Oscar for this). Quite simply one of the best crime movies ever made.</p></body></html>

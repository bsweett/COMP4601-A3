<meta name="summary" content="No Mo Potter"></head><body><p>I wasn't exactly feeling this movie.  I only liked "The Chamber of Secrets" out of all the Harry Potter films.  At this point, it's like sensory overload, and overdone.  It's just the same ol stuff, and the actors look like they're done, and they should be.  I love the way it was filmed, but if your not a big fan of Harry potter in general, the movies are pretty dull and boring.  It borders on pretentiousness, and the guy playing Harry potter needs to get over himself, you ain't all that honey!</p></body></html>

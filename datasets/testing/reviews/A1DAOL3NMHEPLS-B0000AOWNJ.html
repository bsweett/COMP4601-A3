<meta name="summary" content="A confusing mess of a movie!"></head><body><p>This is easily one of the dumbest "mainstream" movies released in recent years. The story line is inconsistent, incoherent and illogical. There are some creepy moments, but the minute you start to analyze the movie, it just falls apart. The only thing that keeps it from being a total dud is the production quality ... and the fact that Naomi Watts is quite a looker.  As for those people who say it's "the scariest movie ever" I have to wonder what other movies they've seen. Probably not Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist, or any of Wes Craven's flicks, to name a few!</p></body></html>

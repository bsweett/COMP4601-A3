<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, comic or no"></head><body><p>Standards have been rising in the comic adaptation genre, and the new Iron Man comes in at the top of the range. This is one of the best comic adaptations ever, and a very good action flick in itself. It gets the summer movie season off to a flying start - if the rest of the season's movies rise to this level, it's going to be a great year.<br /><br />Effects are everythig you could ask, with lots of explosions, fire, and other good enterainment - but that's the norm these days. Plenty sets this apart from the pack. Acting is way up there, as the star-laden cast would have you expect. Scripting offers a blend of humor, action, sneering bad guys, and simmering romance that's hard to beat. It gives Robert Downey Jr. lots to work with, including an outstanding aide in the form (the lovely form) of Paltrow's "Pepper Potts." The main bad guys are the current evil-du-jour, mideastern madmen - so recognizable that they don't even need motives. Heck, even the industrial robots have more personality than the entire casts of some comic flicks.<br /><br />One of the most implausible of plot turns really brought this to life for me: Stark's sudden rethinking of the multi-generation arms business. As an engineer and as one who's tried (not always successfully) to keep my work out of weapons, that exerted more of a pull than there was any rational reason to expect. But that's way too serious for this movie. Even if it jumps the season by a few weeks, it's great summer fun.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

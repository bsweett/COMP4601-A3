I swear, if cigarettes are cancer, some of these people are chemotherapy.  We've all seen those obnoxious TRUTH ads where a bunch of unkempt, college-know-it-all types harass people trying to do their jobs and use all kinds of manipulative devices and questionable "facts" to push their anti-cigarette agenda (I should note in passing that I've never had a cigarette in my life, so I don't have a horse in this particular race).  With their prohibitive taxes and bans on smoking on private property, they've become even more controlling and arrogant lately, as they've done everything but force smokers to enjoy their habit in their basements while wearing haz-mat suits and spraying a fire extinguisher after each puff.  Whatever happened to personal choice?  Whatever happened to independent thought?  Whatever happened to open and honest debate?  Well, Thank You For Smoking is here to address those very questions for your viewing pleasure, with plenty of hilarious moments to accompany its amoral anti-message.<br /><br />Based on the excellent comic novel by Christopher Buckley, Thank You For Smoking isn't a satire so much as a classic black comedy in the Dr. Strangelove mold (not to say this movie is as good as Dr. Strangelove; I'm not about to commit movie heresy), aiming less to critique anything in particular than to defend the indefensible, so to speak.  The indefensible in this case is Nick Naylor, divorced father and fast-talking vice-president of the Academy for Tobacco Studies, a Washington firm that lobbies on behalf of Big Tobacco.  In lieu of a conventional plot, the movie basically just consists of a series of looks into Nick's life and work, with tons of little asides, flashbacks, and voice-overs from Nick giving it a sort of stream-of-consciousness feel.  The tone of the whole thing is pretty slick and smirky, but given its subject matter and protagonist I really don't think it could've worked any other way.  Aaron Eckhardt, who hasn't really impressed me that much in the past, was seemingly born for the role of Nick, as he pretty much embodies what I imagine a tobacco lobbyist would have to be like: cynical, smarmy, and utterly resistant to idealism of any sort.  He's made himself a pretty nice living by exempifying the truism that if you argue correctly you're never wrong, and he always manages to find a way to undercut the emotional appeals of the moralists who think they have him in a rhetorical corner.  Nick is actually rather similar to Nicolas Cage's soulless gun dealer from Lord of War, but not quite as much of a moral vacuum.  Nick's a friendly enough type, and a good dad to his too-smart-for-his-age son, but his line of work has made him very good at compartmentalizing and playing the role of devil's advocate.  I for one couldn't help but like the guy, especially since many of those on the other side were so obnoxious.  Besides, he's gotta pay the mortgage somehow, as he points out in what he terms the "yuppie Nuremberg defense."<br /><br />It also helps that for such a short movie, Thank You For Smoking manages to generate a lot of memorable supporting characters, even if it doesn't quite have the time to develop them all.  Thankfully, Nick's informal membership in the MOD (as in Merchants of Death) squad, one of my favorite aspects of the novel, made it into the movie, and the roles of Nick's compatriots were cast about as well as you could hope for.  Maria Bello was a bit underused as alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, but she's still just as great as she was in A History of Violence, and David Koechner is brilliantly over the top in the role of vaguely rednecky gun advocate Bobby Jay Bliss (sure, it's not all that different from the role he played in Anchorman, but it's funny just the same).  The MOD Squad's lunch meetings provide some of the most blackly funny moments in the movie, as Nick, Polly, and Bobby Jay compare strategies and death tolls and argue about who's the most hated.  It's sort of interesting in a morbid way, seeing three people brought together by the common bond of their seemingly despicable jobs.<br /><br />Going outside Nick's main circle, the movie provides a pretty unflattering portrayal of those who inhabit Washington in general, which isn't really anything new but still ends up being pretty refreshing in this case.  If there's one thing Thank You For Smoking makes clear, it's that lobbyists aren't the only people in the District with their hands dirty.  The movie shows us a political climate where pretty much everybody has a hidden agenda, from Katie Holmes's scheming reporter to J.K. Simmons's backstabbing boss to William H. Macy's grandstanding senator, all of whom make Nick look downright decent.  Indeed, the most honorable character in the movie is probably The Captain, the drawling, unreconstructed tobacco magnate who founded Nick's lobbying firm.  Brought to memorable life by Robert Duvall in what's basically a series of cameos, the Captain may have gotten rich by selling a hazardous product, the movie seems to be saying, but at least he's not bullying or manipulating people.<br /><br />In the end, how much you like Thank You For Smoking will probably come down to your stance on smoking itself.  If you think cigarettes are a scourge and those who produce them the embodiment of evil, you probably won't be able to make much of a connection with this movie's impious stance.  However, if you think the U.S of late has become too PC, too uptight, and too totalitarian, you'll probably appreciate seeing something that (at least partially) turns the moral tables for once.  Sure, it probably won't change the world, but Thank You For Smoking should at least help you laugh at it.</p></body></html>

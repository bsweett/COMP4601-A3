For most of it's two hour running time, Collateral combines both an intricate character study and some intense action set pieces that make it a joy to watch, beginning with cool, calm, and calculated hitman Vincent (Cruise) hitching a ride with taxi driver Max (Foxx).  Max has big dreams and grand ideas and little to show for it, something Vincent uses to his advantage as he takes Max hostage to make his rounds of the night which include the executions of five people.  The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is undoubtadly Collateral's strong point, with Foxx giving a knockout performance and Cruise's surprising performance as one of the best screen villains in the past few years.  However, Collateral loses steam as it approaches it's climax when the tables are turned and a cat & mouse game ensues that ends on an MTA train.  Other than that, everything else about Collateral is nearly flawless, and it is definitely one of the best films to be released this year.  The cast also features Jada Pinkett-Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, and look for a cameo in the opening scene from Jason Statham (The Transporter, Cellular, Snatch).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a creepy, slow-burn vampire movie"></head><body><p>A very unusual vampire movie, from Sweden.  I don't like vampire movies but was told I ought to watch this one at least.  I'm not sorry.<br /><br />My big beef was that while the movie was just fine, the audio/subtitle situation is awful.  The original film is in Swedish.  The disk says there are subtitles, but they don't actually appear, even when the characters are reading Swedish.  What's left is the awful dubbing, which is just comically bad and a constant distraction and spell-ruiner.  Heck, even if you can understand Swedish, you can't get the Swedish audio, which was deleted entirely on the U.S. release.<br /><br />DVD needs to be seriously redone.</p></body></html>

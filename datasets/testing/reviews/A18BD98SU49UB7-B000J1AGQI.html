As the film ended and the lights grew to a glow, the packed audience sat still and paid respectful homage as the fallen soldiers names appeared on the screen. Some around me could barely contain themselves as they shook and cried. Veterans and soldiers in military uniform humbly and quitly remained in their seats long after I left the room. It was amazing to see all of these strangers who had come together to see a movie, suddenly seem to be a part of something special and real. It reminded me of when I first saw Private Ryan a few years back, and saw the same reaction. People who had been arguing and behaving rudely before the movie, were now leaving proudly, holding the door open for the next person. It takes something special to do that. Like Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldier's comes at a time of heightened patriotism and valor. When life has a little more meaning, and when Americans dive deeper within themselves to find an extra emotion of strength to get through the day. What seperates We Were Soldiers from other great Vietnam films such as Platoon, was the effort to show both sides of the war. A Northern Vietnamese soldier, writing in his journal and staring at the photograph of his wife, as at the same time an American soldier is also dwelling on thought's of home. Before American's, The North Vietnamese army had fought the Chinese, and French. The opening sequence is a massacre ten years prior to the Vietnam conflict involving the French. It establishes what the American's would have to face later. As the American soldier's begin to fall, telegram's arrive back on base notifying their wives of their death. The band that the women formed was also inspiring, and how unbelievably strong they must have been. Leaving the theater, I told myself never to forget We Were Soldier's, nor the sacrifice our men, like my own uncle. After watching the world seem to fall apart last year, it's good to remember that even at this moment our men are serving their country every day. Close friend's, and family. Sacrifice's were made in Vietnam for a reason that we are still searching for. If any of our brother veteran's happens to read this simple review, take a higher meaning and the most gracious thought's when I say thank you. They were Soldier's once, and Young. Their youth was lost in the valley's of war, and we owe it to them.</p></body></html>

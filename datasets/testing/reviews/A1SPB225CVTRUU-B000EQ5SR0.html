<meta name="summary" content="Top-notch Actresses Playing Sci-fi Action Chicks."></head><body><p>I was drawn to seeing Aeon Flux, because the trailer provided a few impressive action scenes and I am very interested in seeing the participations of three Oscar-nominated/winning actresses teaming up in this Sci-fi action "chick flick". I have been following Charlize Theron way back in the Cider House Rules days, and loved her work in Monster and her recent North Country. I had to see this film to see if she can play an action hero considered that she's got the supermodel body and she's a great actress. And how often does Frances McDormand submitts herself to a big budget commercial film? Lets not dismiss the appeal of last year's relatively unknown Oscar-nominated Sophie Okonedo, she also plays a strong supporting role that managed to steal some scenes next to Theron.<br /><br />Aeon Flux takes place 400 years in the future, when the virus afflicted Earth had eliminated 99% of the human population, and the remaining one million reside in the city of Bregna, which is controlled by the Trevor Goodchild(Marton Csokas). The citizens are duplicated clones of their original DNAs, but they are all unaware of that they are merely living like a ghost. The Resistant group called Monicants are lead by Handler(a God-like character played by McDormand) have a mission to kill Goodchild and take over the regime. A highly trained and skillful Monicant named Aeon Flux(Theron) and her sidekick Sithandra(Okonedo) are sent to assassin Goodchild . On their mission, there are many dangerous horizons they have to encounter before getting inside the highly secured buildings where Goodchild and his team were hiding. The seemingly fearless and emotionless Flux had no idea that she was a clone and that her true identity becomes clear when she reunites with her forgotten past-life husband Trevor Goodchild. And now she's torn between unsolving the mystery behind the clone humans and abandoning her mission. At the same time, Oren Goodchild(Johnny Lee Miller) is rebelling against Trevor, because he refuse to let Trevor use the new-found cure to the disease that would end the cloning of humans. Both Trevor and Aeon have became fugitives, and they must work together to defeat Oren and the assassins sent by Handler....<br /><br />This film features some great production designs, and the futuristic costumes are quite meticulous and impressive. The fight scenes are rather mediocre, while the special effects are quite worthwhile. Both Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite(who played the clone Keeper) had less than five minutes of screentime, and their roles are just too low-key and unchallenging for them. Theron wears that black spandex bodysuit most of the time, and she even had to wear a flesh revealing beaded underwear in one scene. She also had some steamy and romantic moments with the hunky Marton Csokas.</p></body></html>

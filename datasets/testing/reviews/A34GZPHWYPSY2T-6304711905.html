I find it to be one of the best Westerns ever made, and when you get a whiff of the backstory, you'll agree. I think right off the bat we can say this film succeeded because of the gaudy-yet-riveting Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) and Val Kilmer (Dr. John "Doc" Holliday).<br /><br />This thing as horse operas go is really an old-fashioned cowboy's dream entertainment. While it shamelessly stole from its father, WYATT EARP (vid. my review), it managed to spring the Western back into unprecedented popularity. Also it grossed double what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5N6LG">Wyatt Earp</a> did. It told a fanciful, colorful Earp chapter (restricted to the legendary fight in Tombstone) and it did so with panache, great humor, style, flair and unmatched beauty. Both symbolically and texturally, TOMBSTONE really delivers. It is funny, daring, unconventional and can be deeply moving.<br /><br />It covers the Earp Family's time in Tombstone, centering on the famous street fight, and though it goes overboard with some silly, unnecessary characters (such as Jason Priestly as the gay Billy Breckenridge and Billy Zane as The-Gay-Caballero or whatever he's called who becomes Priestly's love interest), it is good fun. Charleton Heston made an impression here as well.<br /><br />These guys started out with Costner. There was a disagreement, and they split away from Costner's bloated project. After this, Costner made it a living hell for them to finish TOMBSTONE, though as I say, they stole from WYATT EARP, too. The result was critics praising TOMBSTONE for being the first of its kind as an "independent" film. It was "independent" because Costner forced the issue - but he had good right to do so. The producers of TOMBSTONE did not need to steal so much from Costner, then race to beat him to the box office, but I guess bad blood is bad blood.<br /><br />Anyway, do not miss the delicious fun, the over-the-top silliness of the lisping, wisecrackin' Doc Holliday - and the steadfast rock Kurt Russell is, serving to anchor this film. I don't know why but the true clan leader, Virgil (Sam Elliot) is made to look a bit weak and unhinged. Virgil was the family's rock in real life, often the only man who could control Wyatt's losses of temper.<br /><br />They got all that wrong here, but that's the fun of horse opera for horse opera's sake. You'll see why it is considered one of the best films of all time, even if it isn't.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Solid sci-fi classic, but not too subtle"></head><body><p>I can't believe that this came out 30 years ago, so I just had to watch it again and see if I enjoyed it as much as the first time.<br /><br />There is no doubt that this is a very strong sci-fi monster flick for a number of reasons.  The atmospherics, from the cluttered ship to Geiger's eerie designs, are absolutely first rate.  Just by looking at it, you get a feeling for the story, a mixture of fear and fascination that all good sci-fi horror should evoke.  Then there are the characters, all superlatively acted by relative unknowns, including the star-making performance by Weaver.  There are very few sci-fi films that have such fully believable people, so that marks this one in my mind as equal to, say, the Day the Earth Stood Still.  Even the ominous corporation, acting through Mother and Ash, is a sinister presence.  Finally, there is the alien itself, also a wonderful creation that is utterly weird and completely believable in an immediate emotional sense - you just feel the fear, you don't ever have to try to forget that someone made it up.<br /><br />As a sci-fi fan, I love the way that the alien became part of my imagination, more as questions than anything one can know.  Was it brought onto the first ship as an infection that evolved into a more sophisticated organism as it exchanged DNA with the unlucky voyagers?  Or was it some kind a invader, part of some plan that was moving through the universe?  How much did the corporation know about it before the crew went and what did they want from it?  How intelligent was the alien - just to survive or as a hive mind that was in touch with its cohorts?  Even with the subsequent films, you can't really answer these questions, which is a mark of how fertile a product of imagination the film is.  It is completely cogent, much like Close Encounters.<br /><br />On the critical side, I did not enjoy the blood-curdling stuff all that much.  It is gross and graphic.  Also, I did find a lot of the suspense akin to horror house antics and feel that they could have used the alien for more subtle terror.  That means that the first watch is the best, even if it meets the test of multiple watchings.<br /><br />I have a special connection to this film.  WHen I arrived in London fresh out of college, I ran into Tom Skerritt on the street and recognized him form MASH.  He told me he had just made the movie, ALIEN, which he said with his eyes wide open in mock fear.  I have loved the series ever since.</p></body></html>

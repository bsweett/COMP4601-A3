Be warned, those of you that are looking for slasher, blood and guts kind of movie...this is not one for you. This movie deals with the trial of the actual case from the 1970's, there are some scenes detailing the exorcism, but this is does not overshadow the movie in anyway. I found this movie to be very interesting and I was engrossed in the story itself. Very good film, well executed, good direction. A movie that really should not be missed.</p></body></html>

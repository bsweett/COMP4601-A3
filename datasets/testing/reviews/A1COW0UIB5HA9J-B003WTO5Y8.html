She seeks advice on clues from a cannibalistic criminal genius named Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), it later turns into a relationship that turns twisted. Buffalo Bill's latest captive victim is a senator's daughter named Catherine (Brooke Smith) and now Clarice must find the sick freak before it's too late.<br /><br />A brilliant psychological thriller that probes into the minds of viewers ever since it's release. Based on the same book by Thomas Harris, this is a great movie that combines horror with some gory violence, fantastic performances and intelligence. Hannibal Lector became a household name thanks to this movie, but this wasn't the first movie with him in it but in fact it was 1986's "Manhunter" that introduced Hannibal Lector before Anthony Hopkins played the role. It's a cold, cruel and thrilling motion picture from Jonathan Demme that won the 1992 academy awards for best picture and it's score by Howard Shore is excellent as well, it's a class act masterpiece.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD offers excellent picture and sound.

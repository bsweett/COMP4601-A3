Night Shyamalan faced a formidable task in delivering a follow-up to his last outing, "The Sixth Sense," which was a remarkable film; and his attempt at capturing that same quality and integrity in his latest effort has resulted in a film that, while it does not surpass "Sense," is nothing less than it's equal.  Beginning with a screenplay that is brilliant in concept, content and structure, and realized with equal acuity,  "Unbreakable," starring Bruce Willis, is a unique, challenging film that will test the limits of audience perception like never before.  From the cryptic opening scene to the denouement, this is enthralling drama that offers singular insight into the dark capabilities of human nature, and a perspective of evil never before suggested in any movie in the history of the cinema.  Conan Doyle said there's nothing new under the sun, and that may be true; other films may have dealt with similar themes, but the approach Shyamalan takes here is entirely original.  Shyamalan approaches his material like a quiet, unobtrusive Hitchcock, resulting in a style that is quite his own.  His pace is deliberate, and information is doled out in subtle, measured proportions which affords the discerning viewer a chance to  place the myriad pieces of the puzzle into proper order as the story unfolds.  It's a mystery that refuses to let you off the hook, and demands that you think about what is actually going on without respite.  To say that this is thought provoking material would be an understatement; it's an intricate story, the plot of which is complemented by equally complex characters who are detailed and extremely well written and developed.  As he did in "The Sixth Sense," Bruce Willis proves once again that there is so more to him as an actor than being just an action hero.  His portrayal of David Dunn, a man facing a transitional period in his life, is played with a staid countenance that successfully reflects the inner turmoil of the character.  You know from the outset that there is something going on beneath the surface; something unsettling for which Dunn is seeking resolution.  When he becomes the only survivor of a train wreck, it adds to the irresolution in his life as he is suddenly confronted with new issues that take him into still deeper, uncharted waters.  Willis gives a performance that is understated with nuance and depth, and gives Dunn a sense of controlled distress with which the audience can readily identify; that unknown, intangible something that one can feel, yet which remains elusive and unnamed.  It's a powerful statement that illustrates the thin line between reality and the surreal.  Samuel L. Jackson gives a strong performance as well, as Elijah Price, victim of a congenital disease that renders his existence fragile in the extreme.  It's a sympathetic character that somehow refutes sympathy; and Jackson has a presence that makes Elijah real and believable, which is pivotal, as his infirmity is integral to the plot, as is the fact that he and Dunn represent opposite ends of the vast spectrum of life.  Effective in a lesser, yet still significant role, is Robin Wright Penn (Audrey Dunn), who fleshes out the disarray of a wife dealing with the emotional absence of her husband.  The supporting cast includes Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn), Charlayne Woodard (Elijah's Mother) and, in a cameo, M. Night Shyamalan (Stadium Drug Dealer).  With "Unbreakable," Shyamalan has taken up the gauntlet and emerged victorious, with an intelligent, entertaining film so profound that it will no doubt become one of the most under-appreciated films of all time.  There is simply a depth to it that will soar beyond the grasp of the casual viewer; few films have such substance and vision.  Like a Monet, this is art that is both impressionistic and invaluable; a true original in every aspect, and a testimony to the talents of M. Night Shyamalan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well-Done Period Piece On A Man Who Was "Beloved Of God," But Historical Inaccuracies Abound. NOT Recommended As History."></head><body><p>This Academy-Award winning film based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), my favorite composer of all time, is very well done, in terms of costume and set design (as well as the make-up job on F. Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar Best Actor, beating out his fellow actor Tom Hulce, who portrayed the man who was "Beloved Of God.") The brief bits of opera which were shown were staged very well by the legendary Twyla Tharp (especially "Don Giovanni"). For that and the utter beauty and timelessness music of the Master itself, I give it three stars. I withold the fourth and fifth stars because of some HUGE historical inaccuracies AND the unneccessary nude scene (inserted for the Director's Cut). I shall begin.<br /><br />I. I have read several biographies of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, including one by Victor Seroff, and NEVER did I read of Mozart cheating on Constanze (as is implied in the film) or vice versa. If Mozart had done such a thing, his wife would have left him and, as far as I know, she did not desert him for another man (she married again after his death after waiting the decent interval).<br /><br />II. Constanze and Mozart had six children, of which only two survived to adulthood (but they never produced children of their own). In the film, only one child is depicted (I'm not sure which, as he is never named in the damn picture). Serious blunder.<br /><br />III. Constanze NEVER destroyed any of Mozart's work; in fact, she published them herself, recognizing her husband's God-given gift to write sublime music.<br /><br />IV. Mozart was a vulgar man, as shown, but he "Spoke a crude or coarse word" to Constanze, as the movie clearly shows.<br /><br />V. The scene where Constanze undresses in front of Salieri was unneccessary and NOT TRUE. Constanze loved Mozart with all her heart and would NEVER have done such an atrocious thing.<br /><br />VI. Mozasrt DID NOT die in the morning. He died on the night of December 4, 1791. That morning, he gave his pupil (somehow, the movie skipped the fact that he HAD pupils) Franz Sussmayr instructions for the completion of the "Requiem Mass" and that night, the great Mozart died. According to a photograph I saw (and the biography I mentioned earlier in my first point), he died surrounded by his family. He was given a pauper's funeral because HIS FAMILY WAS POOR, NOT because a noble (Baron Von Sweiten, in the play and movie; they omitted his line for the funeral from the script for the movie) sugessted that it was "Vain Show."<br /><br />VII. Why the devil would Salieri want to help Mozart, if his ultimate aim was to destroy him "By any means neccessary"? THERE IS NO PROOF OF THAT!! Please see my previous point for more information on this.<br /><br />VIII. Mozart briefly taught the young Ludwig Von Beethoven (1770-1827) and immediately recognized his genius. Another HUGE error in not depicting this fact.<br /><br />Excellent period piece, but I DO NOT recommend it as a history lesson. The nude scene, as I stated earlier, was unneccessary and has no basis in actual fact. Rated PG-13 for brief nudity.</p></body></html>

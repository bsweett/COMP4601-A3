This, however, did not detract from my enjoyment of the film.  Despite the political message of the piece, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is principally an event film -- a disaster flick in high-gloss packaging.  Go expecting little more, and you should be easily entertained.  Go expecting an Academy Award caliber film, and you'll probably be disappointed.  Kudos to Dennis Quaid on another effortless performance, but the real star here are the special effects.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="As was expected"></head><body><p>This movie got plenty of advance positive press.  I heard about it on TV, on NPR, in magazines, and everyone was hyped for it.  Great premise:  20-something rising star Topher Grace becomes the boss of the 50-something Dennis Quaid in a company take-over.<br /><br />What do you expect from this kind of movie?  Weirdness over the age different and role reversal?  Check.  Grace is going to think he knows it all, but he actually has a lot to learn from Quaid?  Check.  Grace is going to relate to Quaid's daughter better than he does to Quaid?  Check.  The universe is going to be righted at the end of the movie, and both Grace and Quaid are going to go off in the world changed and better people?  Check.<br /><br />This movie delivered exactly what one would expect if they know the premise.  It was formulaic in that respect.  There is still some excellent acting and some great drama, but it is all pretty straightforward.  I wasn't moved or surprised in any way.</p></body></html>

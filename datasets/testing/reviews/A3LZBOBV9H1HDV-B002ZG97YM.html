This is how the story goes: A Viking teenager named Hiccup lives on the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. The teen's smarts and offbeat sense of humor don't sit too well with his tribe or its chief... who just happens to be Hiccup's father. However, when Hiccup is included in Dragon Training with the other Viking teens, he sees his chance to prove he has what it takes to be a fighter. But when he encounters (and ultimately befriends) an injured dragon, his world is flipped upside down, and what started out as Hiccup's one shot to prove himself turns into an opportunity to set a new course for the future of the entire tribe.<br /><br />The voice cast led by Jay Baruchel (as Hiccup) & Gerard Butler (as Stoick) is excellent! The directing by Chris Sanders (he also did the stories to "Beauty And The Beast" (1991), "Aladdin" (1992) & "The Lion King" (1994, also did the production design) & Dean DeBlois (both of them also wrote & directed "Lilo & Stitch" (2002) is brilliant! The screenplay (based on the novel by Cressida Cowell) by Sanders, DeBlois & William Davies (who also did the story & screenplay to "Twins" (1988) & the screenplay to "Flushed Away" (2006) is brilliant!<br /><br />The music by John Powell (who also did the music, recently to "Green Zone" (2010), "Knight & Day" (2010) & the upcoming "Fair Game" (2010), he also doing the music to the upcoming "Rio" (2011) is brilliant! The film editing by Maryann Brandon (who also did the film editing to "Mission: Impossible III" (2006), "Star Trek" (2009), the upcoming "Gulliver's Travels" (2010) & "Super 8" (2011) & Darren T. Holmes (who also did the film editing to "The Iron Giant" (1999), "Lilo & Stitch" & "Ratatouille" (2007) is excellent! The production design by Kathy Altieri (who also did the production design to "Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron" (2002), "Over The Hedge" (2006), she also did the art direction to "The Prince Of Egypt" (1998) is brilliant! The art direction by Pierre-Olivier Vincent (who also did the art direction to "Flushed Away") is brilliant!<br /><br />This is a fun and entertaining animated film that keeps you entertained and amazed. This is a well-made and well-crafted film that is different and interesting than most animated films out there. This is one of the best efforts for Dreamworks, outside of the Shrek movies, ever. This is also one of the best films of the year.</p></body></html>

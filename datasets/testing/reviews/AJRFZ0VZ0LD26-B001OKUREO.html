<meta name="summary" content="Presidential portrait of George W. Bush"></head><body><p>Oliver Stone brings on his latest film portraying freshly departed President George W. Bush.  It is amazing that the man is barely out of office and film about his 8 year presidency and political career is already out.  Josh Brolin gives fantastic performance.  This actor seems to be getting better with age.<br /><br />Stone cowers everything that there is to cover about Bush Junior: from his fraternity days at Yale to failed business enterprises, his meeting Laura Welsh who became his wife, chocking on the pretzel - just about all major snafys we know about the president from his public appearances.  I particularly liked the subtle display of W.'s inability to speak proper english, use of words that only W. could come up with (such as "misunderestimated").<br /><br />While Oliver Stone is taking it easy on Laura Bush, young idealistic librarian who trades her convictions for a comfortable life with the wealthy Bush heir; he takes Bush's cabinet down with the vengeance. No one is spared from his cabinet.  Not that either one of them deserves it.  They are all sellouts who trade their integrity for the access to power.<br /><br />Surely, once you have seen this movie, you will be dazed and confused just as W. himself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Better Horror Movies Made Lately."></head><body><p>I was wondering how well Kate Hudson would do in this film and I must say quite well. The other actors did a well job themselves and the storyline was not confusing to follow. The plot itself is interesting and different, which is always a good thing. And the ending was, to me, very creative and understandable. Unlike in many horror flicks, it is not cliche. I've noticed some horror movies make it too easy in the end, and some just make it too hard to understand. This movie fell nicely in the middle, so this movie gets a good four stars from me.<br /><br />I recommend it to people to at least watch once- I have a feeling many other horror fans will like the movie as well.</p></body></html>

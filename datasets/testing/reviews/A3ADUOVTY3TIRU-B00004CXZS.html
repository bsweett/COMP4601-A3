However, Meyer fought through the muck not only to reunite the trekkies, but also impress and win-over many non-treksters as well with a mix of imaginative special effects, gripping suspense while never losing people with over-elaborate dialouge or indulging in techno-dweeb fascinations. All this works to move an intricate plot, which in a nutshell is a being with superior intelligence named Khan (An inspired, gleefully maniacal Richard Montalban who gives the movies' best performance) who was imprisoned by Captain Kirk (William Shatner) years ago on a desolate, deserted planet. Khan escapes seeking revenge on Kirk as well as getting his hands on the Genesis device, a machine that can basically turn lifeless matter in to something that can sustain life (imagine a moon and turning into a living planet). Kirk runs across Khan while training a new crew for the Enterprise and their battle of wits and weaponry insues. Caught in the middle between Kirk and Khan is the team that created Genesis, which includes Kirk's son and former lover. Meyer skillfully builds the movie to its unbearably suspenseful climax in which Khan and Kirk are hunting each other in a nebula, blinded by the forces within the nebula itself.<br /><br />A skillful blend of action, suspense and tragedy, "Star Trek ll: The Wrath of Khan" is an amazing cinematic milestone.</p></body></html>

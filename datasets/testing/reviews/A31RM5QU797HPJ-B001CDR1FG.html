<meta name="summary" content="The Sulk"></head><body><p>This movie proves that not all superhero movies are good movies.  Other superhero movies usually something in common with the comic book they were in.  The Hulk does not do this.  Bruce Banner isn't the Hulk because his father did weird stuff to his mother.  And CGI Hulk was questionable.  They just couldn't make a suit that looked a hundred times better than CGI (see "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" ).<br /><br />  This is perhaps the worst superhero movie of all time.</p></body></html>

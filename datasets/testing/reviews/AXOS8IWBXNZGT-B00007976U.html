<meta name="summary" content="Williams does a good job!"></head><body><p>This was a creepy thriller starring Robin Williams, which came out a few years ago. RW plays a clerk in a Walmart-like store, where he's the film guy, and has been for a very long time. He becomes obsessed with one particular family, who come in a lot for film development, and he begins to fantasize about being part of that family. He then discovers a family secret, which sends him over the edge. Williams does a good (and disturbing) job playing a quietly disturbed man.</p></body></html>

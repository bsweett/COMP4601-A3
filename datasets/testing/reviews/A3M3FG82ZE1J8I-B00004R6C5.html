<meta name="summary" content="An American film classic"></head><body><p>I think most people reading the reviews for To Kill a Mockingbird have already seen this classic film and/or read the novel.  Suffice it to say, there is little need to indulge in any lengthy film synopsis other than to  say that this film represents one of but a handful of times when a film  truly captures the essence and warmth of the novel on which it is based.  Though I only saw this film once as a child, its memory stuck in my mind  for a long time, and when I heard that the film had been released on DVD, I  quickly purchased a copy.  My memories did not betray me, for this is just  as enchanting and moving a film as I remembered it to be.  Furthermore, the  DVD transfer is excellent.  The picture quality is sparkling and the sound  is crystal clear.  Plus, there is a good commentary track and very in-depth  cast and bio notes.  However, the best extra is the documentary  &quot;Fearful Symmetry.&quot;  Unlike most documentary nowadays, which tend  to focus on self-propaganda and promotion and special effects, this long  (practically feature-length!) documentary uses the film as a starting point  from which to discuss the background era in which the film is set; it  focuses on real people and real locales which find their parallel in the  movie.  In sort, this is quite a remarkable documentary and is, in my  opinion, the best one I've seen on any DVD by a long shot.<p>So, you  already know how great this film is and how great Gregory Peck is in it.  This DVD does the film justice, and I applaud Universal for producing such  a high-quality DVD.  A 5 star effort all the way!</p></body></html>

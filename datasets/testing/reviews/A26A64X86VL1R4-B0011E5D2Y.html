<meta name="summary" content="Good laugh!!"></head><body><p>I liked this film. There were several genuinely funny scenes that made me laugh uncontrollably.  The story of cads who exploit women women and receive their wake-up call, grow up and find true love is an eminently watchable classic story.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are excellent comedians with a wide range and provide their own twist to the characters making them fresh and unpredictable.</p></body></html>

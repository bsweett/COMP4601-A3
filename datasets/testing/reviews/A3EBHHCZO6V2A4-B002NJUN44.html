<meta name="summary" content="Wonderfully,gloriously,laughably bad"></head><body><p>Unlike "Lord of the Rings",I was in stitches within the first five minutes of this movie.<br /><br />Instead of the stately&perpetually talented Cate Blanchett speaking of the changes in Middle-Earth,we gave the pious,noble narration of Jeremy Irons.Irons has one MAJOR problem--he has a hard time saying "Alagaesia" (it's Al-uh-GAY-zuh,to quote the book's pronunnciation guide).So does Sienna Guillory.Jeremy Irons is great as Brom;he imbues his role with a sense of humor&nobility.He has to do all the acting--because nobody else.<br /><br />John Malkovich gets the hilarious opening line of "I suffer without my stone.End my suffering." Galbatorix,both in the book&the movie,isn't a menacing villain.In place of a Lidless Eye,the audience gets a hammy emo Goth.Thankfully,Malkovich is having a rip-roaring time.<br /><br />Ed Speleers plays Eragon as a pretty boy,who makes Luke Skywalker&Frodo (in the Peter Jackson movies)come across as downright macho.He even goes Napoleon Dynamite,saying,"I have skills!"<br /><br />The director,Stefen Fangmeier doesn't mind borrowing openly from the Star Wars trilogy--such as when Eragon watches the sunset.The plot is basically Star Wars.Orphaned farm boy finds out he has magical powers,belongs to a vanquished order destroyed by an evil king,his uncle is slain by an Evil Empire,he rescues a captive princess with the help of a rogue.Yes,you've seen this movie before.<br /><br />The forced,sappy romance between Eragon&Arya brings on a gag,as well as memories of Aragorn&Arwen.It made me long for the sexy,strange romance between Frodo&Galadriel.Besides,I prefer the shirtless Frodo scene in "Return of the King" to the gratuitous shirtless Eragon scene in this movie.<br /><br />The highlights--this movie has great special effects,the scenery is spectacular (Farthen Dur is in actual volcanic crater),and Patrick Doyle provides a great soundtrack,even hearkening back to his better "Henry V" one.<br /><br />"Eragon" is hardly a great epic movie.But it's wonderful dumb fun.</p></body></html>

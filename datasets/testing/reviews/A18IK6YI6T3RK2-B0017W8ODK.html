<meta name="summary" content="ATONEMENT INDEED"></head><body><p>When I first heard that Atonement was going to be made into a film, I thought how will the authors beautiful prose and lavish style be captured on film.  I was pleasantly surprised as I watched this movie at how faithful the screenwriter was to the source, the only qualm I had was the ending, in the book you get a real insight into the thoughts of the elderly Briony and it is extremely revealing, she goes back to the estate, where they are throwing her a party and you lean the fate of all the characters, the way it's layed out is prefect and it is one of the best payoffs of any book I have read, in movie, however, this is given short shrift, we get six minutes of an out of it Redgrave, and its such a huge letdown to anybody who has had the pleasure of reading this fantastic book.  Having said that, however, I must say, overall, I loved this movie, the first act was perfect and the young girl playing Briony was perfect.  Knightley and McAvoy have great chemistry and they convey a yearning that you know would have lasted the test of time.  The second act is well done as well, though I was not as crazy about the actor playing the late teen Briony, she looks just like the younger Briony, but she cant sustain, the younger actors command of the character.  The third act as I mentioned earlier was a real letdown, but if you have never read the book, then you will most likly have little problem with the last act, but for those of us who had it was the difference between this being a five star film or a four star film.  Really good film, could have been great and if you like this film, do yourself a favor and read the book, at least read the last act, it's heartbreaking.</p></body></html>

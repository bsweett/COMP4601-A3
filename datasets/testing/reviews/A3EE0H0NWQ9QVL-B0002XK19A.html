Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and his alter-ego, Spiderman, have enough problems to make the movie continually interesting.  The melodrama envelops our attention, and the action scenes are marvelous.<br /><br />In the beginning Peter Parker sets his sights on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but he's conflicted by his role as Spiderman.  He not only juggles his identities, but his responsibilities as well.  As college student and breadwinner, he stumbles with all of his relationships, including with his aunt and his best friend.  Ironically, this friend has connections with a scientist who can be the key to Peter's success.  When the scientist presents an innovative energy invention, his demonstration goes awry.  It turns the scientist into a monster, Dr. Oct., with barely a will of his own.<br /><br />"Spiderman 2" is a substantial movie because, unlike similar superhero movies, we remain interested and are often at the edge of our seats.  Frequently many hero figures vanquish their opponents too early or too often, but Spiderman has many problems and an incredible adversary.  In the story, the chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane is likable, and Dr. Oct. is certainly menacing enough.  The supporting roles are effective, too.  The portrayal of Peter's Aunt is endearing, and his newspaper editor boss provides an entertaining caricature.  His relationship with his friend provides good connections and variety to the plot.  Screenwriter Alvin Sargent (who won an Oscar for "Ordinary People") gives the screenplay the right touches, and director Sam Raimi is an expert for leading us along this great adventure.  "Spiderman 2" has the look and feel of a flawless comic book hero classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps the best James Bond movie"></head><body><p>This is arguably the best James Bond movie.  The casting is impeccable, and Sean Connery is at his best in this one.  Further, this film follows the book quite closely, and where it departs from it, it is better than the book, which is unusual for a James Bond flick.<br /><br />This film has class.  The scene where Bond comments on the cognac in the meeting with M and the gold expert, and M is plainly irritated by Bond's offhand expertise as to fine liquor, is typical of the film, and hilarious. (Especially so, as M has just finished chewing out 007 for his womanizing on a prior assignment.) In this film Bond is not a comic-book cutout character, or a superman.  He is a fallible human being with a weakness for gorgeous women which, admittedly, he seems to luck into more than is probably humanly possible, but then again why not?<br /><br />"Goldfinger" avoids the pitfalls of some of the later James Bond flicks, and never lapses into slapstick.  The ending is a trifle over the top, (no spoiler here) but only moderately so.  I trust that a re-release of this superb film in DVD is imminent.</p></body></html>

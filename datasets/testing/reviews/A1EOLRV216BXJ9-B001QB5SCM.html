Both were unhappy and after a bitter quarrel split apart abruptly.<br /><br />Came to their rescue was grandma Ella (Shirley Maclaine) - a healer who helped Maggie stand on her feet (a job and a home), reunite the two sisters and consequently found herself reconciliated with her son-in-law.<br /><br />Although the movie had a slow and depressing start, it lighted up with hope when Shirley Maclaine showed up and graced the screen with her intelligence, subtleness and worldliness. The movie provided us a glimpse of an active community for retirement in Florida and it was here that Maggie found her worth and career. Cameron Diaz, as Maggie, looked very much in the role - she was so unattractive before her life was transformed by Maclaine but radiant with purpose afterwards, so much so she could rescue Toni Corette's fallen apart engagement. Toni Corette (Mauriel's wedding) was the one to watch. She was not very beautiful yet she was real and unpretentious. She had far less scenes with Shirley Maclaine than Cameron Diaz did, but she alone could deliver her own struggle with her feelings for and against her sister fluidly and capture attention. Towards the end, there were warm moments that could evoke an overflow of emotions and sentiments.<br /><br />Blood is thicker than water. An emotional baggage not handled means one (Maggie) has not yet grown up and jeopardised one's (Rose's) happiness even with an engagement ring on the finger. A feel good movie that women audience could definitely relate to their personal experiences.</p></body></html>

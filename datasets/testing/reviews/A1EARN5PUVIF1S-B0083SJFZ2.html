<meta name="summary" content="Kraken Fine Remake"></head><body><p>This remake of the Ray Harryhausen classic offers state-of-the-art special effects and a brisk pace to move the story along.<br /><br />Unfortunately characterization suffers.  And Sam Worthington may be a good actor, but he looks more like a soccer player or a marine here than a son of the gods.<br /><br />It appears that most of the budget for the film went to the special effects, which are admittedly pretty special.  The Kraken, giant scorpions, Pegasus, and Medusa in particular are something to see, a vast improvement over the charming but limited Harryhausen stop-motion creations of decades past.<br /><br />But the big-name cast is pretty limited: Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes carry some weight as Zeus and Hades, but the only other name players here aside from Worthington are Gemma Arterton and Pete Postlethwaite.  The original "Clash" boasted, of course, Laurence Olivier, Burgess Meredith, Harry Hamlin, Ursula Andress, and numerous others.<br /><br />I deducted one star because of the skimpiness of the extras on this disc: just some alternate and additional scenes, but no director's commentary or, more damaging, no "making of" featurette showing how some of the eye-popping effects were created.<br /><br />Still, fans of Olympian spectacle will find plenty of eye-candy on display if little food for thought.  Worth a rental, at least -- maybe a purchase if a "tenth anniversary" DVD comes along with more extras.</p></body></html>

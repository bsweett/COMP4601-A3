How is it that the writers, directors, and actors of live-action productions can't seem to generate much that isn't a half-hearted imitation of better productions from years ago while those in animation seem to keep getting better and better?  While it borrows heavily in atmosphere from James Bond and other 60s spy movies (as well as  "The Return of the Jedi" and other sci-fi action flicks), "The Incredibles" is a rollicking good time in its own right . . . and is a better James Bond movie than any produced in the past 20 years.  The idea of a family of superheroes isn't exactly new--and shows like "The Tick" have already lampooned the tribulations of superheroes in an everyday world--but "The Incredibles" pulsates with such energy and imagination that it's easy to overlook its faults.  Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are two actors I'd never have thought to pair up, but here they work amiably as a husband and wife team of semi-retired crimefighters struggling to raise a family while remaining incognito from a litigious world.  When a new archenemy arises (who looks like the love child of Heat Miser and John Lithgow), they are pressed back into action, this time with the help of their kids.  The computer animation in "The Incredibles" is solid, and the images and score manage to evoke Bonds like "You Only Live Twice" and "The Man with the Golden Gun," as well as productions like "Forbidden Planet," "Johnny Quest," and even the Walt Disney spaceflight shows.  True, there is some surprising violence, and this is another vehicle aimed at children that seems to want to teach them that only white people and the occasional black sidekick (here Samuel L. Jackson instead of Eddie Murphy or Chris Tucker) exist in the world, but it's a fun ride.  I do hope those responsible produce a sequel, if one with a bit more diversity.</p></body></html>

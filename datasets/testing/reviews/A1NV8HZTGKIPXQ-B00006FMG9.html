"Psycho", anyone?. This isn't one of those cases. "Red Dragon" is a re-make of 1986's "Manhunter". While that film is just fine, it isn't one of those films were there isn't an open door for improvement or re-doing. Thus, "Red Dragon". Based on Thomas Harris' 1981 novel of the same name, this new version is heads and shoulders above it's first incarnation. First of all, let's get to the plot. The movie begins with a nifty opener(not in the book or first film)that deals with Dr. Hannibal Lecter's capture by FBI agent Will Graham(Edward Norton). While Will was horribly injured in the process, he survives and stops Lecter. Flash forward several years and Will is retired in Florida. He works on boat motors with wife and little boy. Jack Crawford(Harvey Keitel)visits and asks for Will's help in solving a case. A serial killer named 'The Tooth Fairy' is stalking families and then brutally murdering them. The identity of the madman is Frances Dollarhyde(played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes). He is a seriously disturbed psychopath who had a rather harsh childhood. Will goes to Dr. Lecter to ask the brilliant madman for his help in tracking down the killer. Ah, Hannibal. There has never been a screen villain like him in cinema history. While we were all disappointed with "Hannibal", the character that we know and love and get creeped out by in "Silence", is back. Boy, is he back. Anthony Hopkins returns to fine Lecter form here. His voice and way of speech are creepier than ever. His motions and expressions are classic Lecter. This is the performance we should've seen in "Hannibal". The character works better with a smaller, supporting role. The much larger, starring role he had in "Hannibal", just doesn't work. Imagine Darth Vader in every frame of "Star Wars". Just wouldn't work. Some reviews say it's camp and funny. Sorry folks, that was "Hannibal". Not here. Some people also worried how Hopkins would look since this movie is supposed to be years before "Silence". All I can say is that he looks just like he did. Sure, there's some age there, but it's nothing big or noticeable. He looked just like he always did in my book. Not that age has anything to do with anything anyways. Edward Norton is a great actor. One of the better ones we got going nowadays. However, I couldn't get over the feeling of how he was miscast. He does a good job. There's nothing wrong with the performance, it's just that he's too young and feels out of place in the role. Ralph Fiennes as Dollarhyde is magnificent. His portrayal is scary, creepy, and has depth and emotion. I didn't think I would forget Tom Noonan's original portrayal, but I just did. Phillip Seymour Hoffman also appears as an annoying reporter for a gossip rag called 'The Tattler', and british star Emily Watson appears as Dollarhyde's blind co-worker that he falls for. The talented Mary Louise Parker also co-stars as Norton's wife Molly. She pretty much has nothing to do but be scared. The script is tight and clever. Ted Tally who wrote "Silence", and won an Oscar for it, is back writing this one. Thank god. He keeps it like "Silence" and we can't thank him enough for it. Director Brett Ratner shows that he can be a serious director, and not just the guy who did the "Rush Hour" movies. He did an admirable job. Good for him. Two other familiar faces from "Silence" appear, but I won't say who. The end scene is also a nice wink to "Silence". The movie is far more gripping and dark than "Manhunter" could ever dreamed of being. It's clever, intelligent, and suspenseful. One of the sharpest thrillers to come out of Hollywood since....well, since "Silence". One of my favorite films so far this year. Watch it with some fahva beans and a nice chianti.</p></body></html>

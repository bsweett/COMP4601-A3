I have to wonder what they thought when they viewed the outcome.  Yikes!  Each of these men is so charming, if left alone, it takes some effort to make them look as bad as they did here.  Newman gets away with more because he is still so handsome and he doesn't have as many scenes as Hanks.  Hanks' method of acting here is to furrow his brown (see the DVD cover) and never let it unfurrow for the rest of the film.  When he shoots people his brow is furrowed, when he gets shot, his brow is furrowed, when he is hugged by his son, his brow is furrowed...you get the picture.<br /><br />The cinemetography is striking but even that looks overly pretentious in this callow, stupid film.  Mendes has greatly over-reached here and he failed big time.<br /><br />I have to say a word for Daniel Craig who does a very good job as the bad son.  Jude Law, a favorite of mine, is so creepy that he's laughable.  He does a wonderfully elegant fall though.  The ending, supposedly a heartwarmer, does little to make up for all the bloodletting that you have to sit through to get to it.  Maybe just fast forward to the last two minutes...and spare yourself the rest.</p></body></html>

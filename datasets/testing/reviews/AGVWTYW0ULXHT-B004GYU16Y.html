<meta name="summary" content="Angelina Jolie as a superhero spy is intense and exhilarating - La Femme Nikita meets Bourne Ultimatum"></head><body><p>I had very little interest in seeing this when it came out.  Reviews proclaimed that Angelina Jolie was the female Bourne - and I assumed that meant Lara Croft with a bit more smolder and sweat, in a slightly more realistic setting.  No thanks.<br /><br />But I was wrong.  I really liked this.  Salt is every bit as intense as the Bourne trilogy, and Jolie pulls it off with style.  It's not at all plausible, but neither is Bourne; and in both series the non-stop action kept me so engaged I never had time to wonder whether it made any sense until afterwards.  While it's happening it's simply intense and exciting, and kept me guessing.  I did anticipate the major twist towards the end, but it was still a lot of fun to watch.  The basic set up - of a defecting KGB agent, who tells the CIA that Salt is a sleeper double agent, allegedly as his only way to get her activated and give her a mission - is pretty far fetched when you stop and think about it.  The action also, is over and above what's humanly possible - but it's rendered so precisely that you don't get lost while it's going on.  What struck me, afterwards, is that Salt managed to achieve the same intensity as, say, the Bourne Ultimatum, but without the lack of clarity that you find in that film due to the shaky camera and jump cuts.<br /><br />Salt's a fun flick - an intense and exhilarating, non-stop, keeps-you-guessing spy game.  It looks great on Blu-Ray, and includes an extended edition and director's cut.  The director's cut is the best - it adds a bit more graphic violence, but also gives a bit more clarity about the characters and their relationships.</p></body></html>

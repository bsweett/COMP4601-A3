<meta name="summary" content="Barely tolerable to grumpy old me -- but Alan Artkin's performance shines"></head><body><p>.I should really stay away from these "feel good" comedies.  But I must admit I laughed out loud a little bit.  It was worth watching just to see the performance of Alan Arkin.<br /><br />The story follows a family driving from Arizona to California so that their little daughter can compete in the "Little Miss Sunshine" contest.  The film pokes fun at everything, including the human potential movement, the concept of a dysfunctional family, beauty pageants in general, and homophobia.  It all seemed so stupid that I felt like turning it off at once.  But then Alan Arkin came on the scene, cast brilliantly in the role of the "dirty old grandpa" and he absolutely stole the show.<br /><br />But one performance does not make a film I like.  And this firm doesn't even get on the playing field  in that category.  I just wish I had the power to cut and paste the sections with Alan Arkin and just watch those parts.  He was really that good.<br /><br />Comedy lovers who want to come out of the theater with a warm and fuzzy feeling might like this film.  But to grumpy old me, with the exception noted above, it was barely tolerable.</p></body></html>

Sick of the examinations he underwent as a child and the interest of the government and medical establishment in his power, he lies low under an assumed name in Vegas, performing cheap tricks and living off small-time gambling "winnings." But when a terrorist group threatens to detonate a nuclear device in Los Angeles, government agent Callie Ferris must use all her wiles to capture Cris and convince him to help her stop the cataclysm.<br />The action and suspense kept me satisfied to the very end. The acting  and the story was superb. The action, and the sequence of events made it a very entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Character Study, Yes; Funny Comedy, Not Exactly, At Least to Me..."></head><body><p>A dysfunctional family takes to the road for their daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), who has a shot at the finals of a beauty pageant for little girls in California. Greg Kinnear is Richard a success obsessed father who developed a mental training method to succeed, and Alan Arkin is a powder-sniffing Grandpa. Everyone in this family has some problem; Toni Collette as Sheryl, Richard's wife, Steve Carell as suicidal Frank and Paul Dano as Dwayne who vowed never to speak. The film has already been praised by the critics and general audiences, but it is also true that the film is not to everyone's taste.<br /><br />Many people say "Little Miss Sunshine" is a funny comedy. I don't disagree with their opinions, but I find the film totally different way because the film contains a considerable amount of sadness or poignancy in it behind the apparently hilarious part of the film. I am not sure this sadness creeping into the film's world is really the original intention of the directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, or the writer Michael Arndt, but I can say if you're looking for a kind of story in which underdogs become what you call "winners," maybe this is not your film.<br /><br />For all the absurd scenes in their cross-continental journey or the farces at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, the characters take themselves very seriously, and are determined to be true to themselves. And their adamant decision might sometimes irritate you. The characters are not begging to be liked, but still you will notice the changes of heart in every one of them by the end of the story. So "heart-warming" would be a misleading tag to this film for the people in it are often annoying like someone in your own family.<br /><br />The actors are all great. Many have already praised Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear and of course Abigail Breslin the centerpiece of the film, so I won't add any more words. The filmmakers are clearly helped greatly by their talent - Paul Dano's son part needs more improvement and some minor characters like police officer or hospital doctors are not as great as others -- but the entire cast of the main characters still did a fine job.<br /><br />`Little Miss Sunshine' is not free from clich&eacute; and unnecessary quirkiness. The satires could have been more biting with more skillful or daring treatment of the pageant scenes, where little girl Olive does one thing. It is not my cup of tea, but the film is certainly a good character study, not afraid of showing unlikable part of them. Or you may come to like them in spite of (or because of) their flaws.</p></body></html>

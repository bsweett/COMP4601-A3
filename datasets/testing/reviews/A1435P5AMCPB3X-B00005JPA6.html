It played like all other highly computer driven films.  The story is of war torn Spain around WWII, and a little girl who has to move in with her new stepfather, a colonel in the army.  They move to the countryside so he can be near the front line of a gorilla faction.  Amongst this chaos, a girl finds an escape into a fantasy world, where she finds out she was supposed to be all along.  Now whether this was supposed to be a War movie or a Fairy Tale, it's hard to tell.  They needed to split the two apart because I found the one storyline got in the way of the other.  The gruesomeness of the war scenes did not mix well with the discovery and the imagery of the "underworld" fantasy.  Definitely not a family movie, never meant to be, so do not let your kids watch this, but I would not recommend adults watch this either.  Spend your rental money elsewhere.</p></body></html>

Sure the shower-scene in particular is a mind-blower, but Hitchcock was much better off in the suspense-genre...  This story simply isn`t interesting enough. It reason may be that it always had a GREAT reputation and everyone who ever saw it knew if by heart and thus destroyed the first viewing of others...  Another factor is that Janet Leigh is much 2 pretty and ladylike for her role. When I saw Anne Heche in the 1998 movie I realised that H E R Marion was indeed a low-life, tramp - sort of - who jumped at the chance of doing something stupid 2 her employer. Janet Leigh`s Marion is never at any moment stupid...  Alas, Anne was much more satisfying, as were Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore. <p>John Gavin and Vera Miles are lifeless - cardboard stereotypes and that leaves us only with Martin Balsam and the great Anthony Perkins. THEY breath life into their characters and are the main reason I like this version. William Macy and Vince Vaughn repeated their roles, but eh..... hehehehe???????? Let there be silence.  In 1983, Perkins reprised his role as Norman Bates to even better effect in the splendid PSYCHO II.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not quite taken with this one..."></head><body><p>This film has a lot of problems.<br /><br />First of all, not for one second did I believe Neeson was the father of that girl.  It just didn't feel real at all.  Second he was so earnest and good that he's not a believable character.  Never really gets angry...he's just this warm ray of goodness in all he does.<br /><br />Then the action ramps up.  Some of it didn't excite me; in particular there's a car chase that really bored me.  I also wish he would have been more passionate in disposing of the bad guys.  If I were slaughtering the men that stole my daughter, you can be sure I would have enjoyed it.<br /><br />The whole time I was imagining how much better say...a smart-allecky Bruce Willis would have fit the bill.<br /><br />I do have to say...there is one REALLY good "Oh ****!" moment that I won't spoil for anybody.  Man that was great.  But it doesn't make the film for me.<br /><br />And then the end...not to give anything away...but it just seemed pointless, tacked on and hokey.  The emotional core of this film just isn't there.<br /><br />If you're really desperate for some gunshot wounds and broken bones then this will do.  But I can't recommend it to anyone...except my parents.  They're a sucker for any thriller.</p></body></html>

Right about when the stock spooky piano music started playing on the soundtrack, followed by the panning-in-over-water opening shot.  If the Hollywood thriller formula becomes any more rigid, we will soon be seeing the same exact movie over and over again.  But anyway, basically this is a very long episode of the X files, with Julianne Moore in the role of Scully.  Not bad casting actually.  I mean, Julianne Moore and Scully kind of resemble eachother and are both redheads.  And I can tell you in confidence that Julianne Moore for one is a real redhead, if you get my meaning.<br />addition 1-26-05:  Okay, so a lotta you ingrates have been spamming my review with unhelpful votes.  So lemme see if I can make myself more clear.  This is basically a grade B X Files episode, complete with some lushed-up ex hockey player in the role of Mulder.  Yeah that's right folks, for tonight's performance the role of Mulder's cell phone will be played by Johnnie Walker Red Label.  But not to worry though.  After much pressure from Julianne "Scully" Moore, Lushed-up Mulder takes the bottle to the sink and pours it all down the drain.  I stopped watching at this point, so I did not find out whether these cheap dramatics were followed by a scene of Scully Moore fast asleep while Lush Mulder frequents the local licka sto, as my homies in South Central like to say.  If this was not the ensuing development then either the movie is totally lacking in realism or the audience is treated to a plot line that involves Scully Moore contending with Lush Mulder coming down with the French Fits whilst they are on the lam from the saucer people and the NSA and posssibly also the Lizard Men from Denver Airport and the Rand Corporation and some members of the British Royal Family.  Yes, I imagine that the rest of the movie went something like this:  "Scully, I think I figgered it out.  The saucer people are sending pink elephants to steal our memory.  That explains my blackouts, don't it?"  "Jesus Mulder, can't you keep it together here?"</p></body></html>

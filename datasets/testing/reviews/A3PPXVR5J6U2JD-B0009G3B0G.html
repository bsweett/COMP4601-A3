<meta name="summary" content="Dead But Dreaming?"></head><body><p>On the surface, The Jacket appears to be a One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest-style psychological thriller.  But it might just be a time-traveling religious meditation on the afterlife, more along the lines of Jacob's Ladder.<br /><br />Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is clearing out a village during the Gulf War when a child soldier shoots him in the head. Returning to Vermont in 1992, he suffers from bouts of amnesia, wandering aimlessly along a road until he happens upon a drunk woman and her daughter. After helping them both, he hitches a ride with a suspicious character that ends up being bad news. Before Starks knows it, he's been shot once again with a bullet to the head.  That's two bullets to the head for those of you counting at home.<br /><br />Starks is indicted for murder but his amnesia leaves him bereft of a coherent thought or much of a defense.  He is instead committed to a mental institution where Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) regularly terrorizes poor Starks by wrapping him in a straight jacket (hence the name) and stuffing him in a morgue drawer. Makes sense, right?<br /><br />While inside the drawer, Starks begins to hallucinate - or, depending on your perspective, time travel - and he encounters people who look oddly familiar from his past life. Throughout the dreamy, often disconnected scenes of The Jacket, actors show up in different roles to keep us guessing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, The Jacket is a dreamy hodgepodge of flashes: backwards, forwards, and sideways. Depending on your interpretation, Starks is actually time traveling, experiencing a trial of the soul, or simply working through his issues before he dies. While the movie proscribes to all these possibilities (there are multiple endings on the DVD), they are a series of unsatisfying choices.  Each of them punishes the viewer for investing time in the film.<br /><br />SPOILER JACKET:  If Starks is hallucinating, the film has no impact at all because nothing matters.  If Starks is time traveling, the  movie becomes an exercise in absurdity in which he's hit not once, not twice, but three times in the head; more apt for a Three Stooges episode. If Starks is dead (my preferred ending), then it's possible that he's not actually influencing anyone but merely working his way through limbo. It diminishes his selfless acts, which are ultimately really about saving himself.<br /><br />The Jacket tries to keep viewers guessing by making every possible ending the "right" one, but ends up leaving everybody unsatisfied.</p></body></html>

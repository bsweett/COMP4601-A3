<meta name="summary" content="A Descent into Evil"></head><body><p>"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a dark tale of human greed and deceit.  What starts out as a thoroughly corrupted crime against parents descends into something even worse.  There is a horrible viscous circle at work which no one is able to right.<br /><br />Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) convinces his younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke), to rob their parents' jewellery store in the suburbs of New York.  The parents are not meant to be working on the day of the heist and, although they may be disturbed by the crime, insurance will cover their losses.  The brothers each have their own financial difficulties and the robbery will relieve them of their troubles.<br /><br />The crime, however, goes terribly wrong.  Their mother is unexpectedly working on the day and dies of a gun shot wound.  The trail left by the brothers slowly unravels and the especially conniving Andy is seen for being the epitome of evil.  Needless to say, the brothers are found out.  In a particularly bleak scene, Andy gets his comeuppance.  At least some justice seems to be at work in a roundabout way.<br /><br />The performances of both Hoffman and Hawke are good.  They are plausible in their roles.  Their father, played by Albert Finney is also well managed.  His grief at times is palpable.<br /><br />Overall, the film is good without being great.  It is worth the effort but is unlikely to win a swag of awards.</p></body></html>

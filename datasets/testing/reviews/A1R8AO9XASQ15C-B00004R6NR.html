<meta name="summary" content="One of Spielberg's best"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg won the Oscar for directing &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; and it is as great as any other Big, Serious Movie you'd care to name. But that same year he also directed the pulpy &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; which, for reasons of its own, was just as special as his angry and deeply personal Holocaust masterwork.<p>Here is a special effects movie that, like &quot;Terminator 2&quot; before it, heralded a new era of filmmaking. True, both movies announced the arrival of a lot of bad cinema (&quot;Jurassic Park III,&quot; anyone?), but &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is memorable because of the love and care its director lavished on his beasties. This is sci-fi adventure escapism at its best.<p>The story is not terribly strong, more like a clothesline on which to hang some of the most exciting action scenes ever devised. The movie isn't as elaborate as Michael Crichton's book, but it's just as fast-paced and handles its resurrected dinosaurs with equal awe. Did Spielberg dumb-down some of Crichton's more difficult scientific concepts? You betcha, but you know what? I've seen worse.<p>I will always admire this movie for the T-Rex sequence, which scared me so badly in the theater that I had to pony up three more times to take the ride again. What a great moment; it sort of makes me imagine what it must have been like to have seen the premiere of &quot;King Kong&quot; back in 1933, because &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; garners comparison.<p>The velociraptors were also great villains, photographed in menacing fashion and given distinct personalities of their own. The final scene, which brings together the T-Rex and the raptors, is a fast, brutal classic that leaves you wanting more. Wisely, Spielberg gives us just enough.<p>The acting isn't great, but it is efficient. I give high marks to Jeff Goldblum for his flashy portrayal of chaotician Ian Malcolm (is he trying to channel Bono?) and Sam Neill, for his Harrison Ford-like turn as Dr. Grant. Laura Dern grates a nerve, and Richard Attenborough plays John Hammond as if he were Santa Claus, but these are flaws I'm willing to overlook.</p></body></html>

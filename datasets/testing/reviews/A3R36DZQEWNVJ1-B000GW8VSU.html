<meta name="summary" content="Not bad remake with a partial good Washington........."></head><body><p>Denzel Washington (Training Day, Man On Fire) gets a case of paranoia in this updated remake  of the 1960's classic, the one with Blue Eyes in it. Anyway, so Washington was saved in Gulf War supposedly he thinks by candidate Liev Schreiber (Scream Trilogy, Kate & Leopold) who is running for vice president. Schreiber's mother is played by Meryl Streep (upcoming Prime with Uma Thurman, The Hours) who gives a good performance here as she fools everyone around her, giving speeches and so on. So, Washington becomes really paranoid, asking questions, figuring things out and making sense of it if it's real or not. Not bad remake delivers some weird things with a partially good Denzel Washington....towards the end he wears off. Schreiber is real good in this as well. Also starring Jon Voight (National Treasure, Midnight Cowboy) and Kimberly Elise (John Q., Set It Off).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'Iron Man 2' Has Nearly the Same Thrust as the Original"></head><body><p>The best asset of a superhero franchise is when any installment lacks hubris:  either from its hero or from those who design it.  When a superhero is thrust in such peril that the outcome is in question, and the usual assumption that the good guy always wins has to be drawn back to consciousness, you know the creators have assembled a great movie.<br /><br />All the parts are intact:  The trajectory is fun; the enemy is menacing; the dialog is witty and clever; and the story is cogent and clear--easy enough to understand, but detailed enough to be stimulating without overloading our efforts to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />This time Iron Man [aka Tony Stark] (Downey Jr.) faces off with a Congressional committeeman, headed by Senator Stern (Chandling) who challenges his personal armored technology as dangerous and capable of escalating the arms race when brought to the wrong hands.  Stark's snappy answers win the day, but his lack of concessions bring a headlong, prideful fall that sends him unraveling.<br /><br />The Senator's witness, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell)[another arms' dealer] doesn't take his defeat in stride.  While showing off his prowess at auto race in Monaco, Stark faces his biggest challenge when an equally disgruntled Russian nemesis, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) unveils his electrifying half-man, half-human hybrid imitation.  From there Hammer builds an alliance with Vanko that makes inroads into the U.S. military, including with Stark's closest ally, Lt. Col James Rhodey (Cheadle).<br /><br />Of course the trajectory of the movie doesn't work without the fun.  A celebrated Iron Man must be chastened by all his handlers, including Pwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, his still wise-cracking assistant.  New to the fray is Scarlett Johansson in a refreshing, make-over role as the attractive and lethal duo identity Natalie/Natasha.  And while Stark's adolescent tendencies are not towed in line by both leading femme fatales, Cheadle and Jackson give able support.<br /><br />This adventure does go to the edge of danger, but not enough to fully pay dirt.  In some ways this isn't a five-star film for what I first thought were intangibles.  My first inclination was to dock the movie for its overlong half-time exposition, but that's not really fair.  An adventure movie that takes time out to think shouldn't be diminished, particularly when it delivers on the intelligence.  It also helps that Iron Man has some health/toxicity issues, thickening the plot, even if it is a dropped opportunity to provide more tension.<br /><br />The freshness and fun are just as apparent; it just comes down to the one factor I started out with at the beginning:  Do you have to stop and wonder (while you're clinging to someone's hand [or your chair] and sitting at the edge of your seat) how this guy is going to get out of all the mess?  What this sequel has going for it will propel it to at least two more sequels, but to have the cliffhanger feel of a sequel, like, say, 'Spider Man 2' is a bit of a stretch.</p></body></html>

Overall, I didn't like it as much as Kevin Spacey's movie about Bobby Darin, "Beyond The Sea."  But it was interesting and reminded me of some songs I haven't heard in 30 years, and they were better than I expected, even sung by the actors instead of singers.  The relationship between Cash and June Carter develops in a way that's both realistic and romantic, while his relationship with his father is also realistic but kinda sad.  Both of these relationships are resolved as the movie comes to an uplifting conclusion.  Joaquin Phoenix (Signs) is pretty good as Cash, though to me sometimes his performance seemed a bit over the top, but I'm no acting expert, I'm probably wrong.  However, I thought Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven) was sensational as June Carter and  Robert Patrick's (The X-Files) restrained performance as Cash's father was the sort that should win awards.  In conclusion, I think for fans of Johnny Cash or June Carter or Reese Witherspoon, this is a 5-star movie (10-stars where available!), and for the rest of us just a notch below, still definitely worth seeing, interesting and surprisingly upbeat.</p></body></html>

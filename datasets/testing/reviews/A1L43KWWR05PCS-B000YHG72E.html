<meta name="summary" content="A MANCHILD IN THE PROMISED LAND..."></head><body><p>This is a cute holiday film that is fun for the whole family. Will Ferrell is charmingly funny in the role of a human who is brought up by elves from the time that he was an infant. Through happenstance and fate, our very human elf,  named Buddy, after  the brand of diaper that he was wearing when he ends up in the North Pole, spends his days working in Santa's toyshop. Since he is over six feet tall and towers over the diminutive elves, Buddy sometimes feels a little bit out of place, especially as he is not much of a toy maker.<br /><br />When he accidentally discovers that he is not an elf at all, he is told the truth about his origins and discovers that his biological father is alive and well and living in New York City. So, he leaves his Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) and goes  off into the wild blue yonder to hook up with dear old dad (James Caan).  He makes quite a journey, only to discover that dear old dad is not really interested in welcoming a thirty-year-old son  of whose existence he was formerly unaware.  Of course, the fact that Buddy is dressed in a bright green elf outfit and sporting canary yellow tights does not help his cause.<br /><br />While Buddy felt a little out of place with the elves, his initial interactions with humans are totally off the wall and oftentimes quite amusing. With time, however, Buddy learns how to interact with humans. He finds brotherly love, true love, and familial love, as well. This does not happen, however, until he has undergone some personal angst. Buddy also discovers that he has a unique talent, one that will make him quite popular with a younger crowd.<br /><br />Will Ferrell approaches his role with a certain wide-eyed innocence and naivet&eacute;  that is endearing. He is also quite funny in this film.  Bob Newhart is, as always, deadpan funny. James Caan is excellent as the reluctant father. An unrecognizable Ed Asner is an effective Santa Claus. The film is well-directed by Jean Favreau, who has created a delightful film that should become a holiday favorite.</p></body></html>

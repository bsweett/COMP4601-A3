The two directors have a great deal in common as filmmakers. They differ in one major fashion: Tarantino likes to wallow in Americana in his films, while there is no similar celebration of English culture in Ritchie's films. Ritchie also tends to be far more kinetic in his use of the camera, using a lot of jump cutting, shots with unexpectedly harsh lighting, and some almost surreal insert shots. If Quentin Tarantino were English and had watched RUN LOLA RUN twenty or thirty times, the result might be a film that very closely resembles this one.<p>The cast, many of whom are either well known in general or known from Ritchie's other hit film, LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, is absolutely first rate. One of the great virtues of the film is that despite having a large cast and a devilishly complex plot, one rarely gets genuinely confused about the interrelationships among the various characters.<p>The one actor who especially impressed me was Brad Pitt. In my opinion, there are two Brad Pitts. The better known is a mildly entertaining but mainly boring romantic leading man. Star of such dull flicks as MEET JOE BLACK and LEGENDS OF THE FALL. The other Brad Pitt is one of the most effective character actors in Hollywood. We have seen this Brad Pitt before in films like THE TWELVE MONKEYS (for which he received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor) and TRUE ROMANCE. Pitt stands out in this film as a gypsy who is both an extraordinary street fighter and the speaker of his own language. Approximately 10% of what Pitt says in this movie is recognizable language; the other 90% is some form of indecipherable language. But the great thing is that it never sounds like just gibberish. Personally, I wish Pitt would never make another romantic movie--whether comedy or drama--and spend all his energies as an actor on quirky character roles. He is fairly boring as a romantic actor, but is utterly remarkable in his character roles.<p>Ironical casting: One of the gypsies is portrayed by Jason Flymyng, who played Frederick Pope in THE RED VIOLIN, an English Lord who obtained the title instrument from some gypsies, one of whom he later &quot;entertained&quot; in his bedroom. The actress portraying this gypsy was the then unknown Minnie Driver.</p></body></html>

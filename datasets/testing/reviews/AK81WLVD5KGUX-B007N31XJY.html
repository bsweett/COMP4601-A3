<meta name="summary" content="Not just another legal thriller (_or_ Julia Roberts vehicle)"></head><body><p>It's sure hard to find any opinions about this movie that aren't knee-jerk. On the one hand, the movie and its hero are attacked by people who don't seem to think corporations can do any wrong. On the other, it's defended by people who seem to think having a Good Heart is all that's necessary to Defend The Environment and the Public Health.<p><p>Well, the true story involves _both_ junk science _and_ sleazy corporate practices. And whether or not the &quot;science&quot; in the movie is defended by actual scientists (which it isn't), Erin Brockovich was and is a hero.<p><p>One hard fact is that hexavalent chromium probably wasn't responsible for all the injuries attributed to it in this film. Yes, it's a carcinogen and it's dangerous when inhaled. But so far as I know, there's no evidence linking it to all the problems detailed in this movie when it's ingested as part of the drinking-water supply. (Not that I'd want to risk it myself, mind you.)<p><p>But another, and equally important, hard fact is that Pacific Gas and Electric _did_ screw up big-time. The company knew Cr(VI) was a health hazard, _didn't_ know exactly what the risks were (at that time nobody did -- in fact we still don't), failed to take obvious (and, for better or worse, EPA-mandated) precautions against polluting the local groundwater with the stuff, and then lied to everybody about everything. They were not heroes, and Brockovich did uncover their wrongdoing.<p><p>Brockovich, as I said, was and is a hero, and she is well portrayed in this film. I am not ordinarily a fan of Julia Roberts (in fact, frankly, I haven't liked her in anything but _Steel Magnolias_). But she does a nice job here.<p><p>The movie, while (I'm told) varying in places from the facts of the actual story, manages to avoid falling into at least _some_ obvious cliches. Far, for example, from portraying a triumph of the &quot;little guy&quot; over the big corporate baddies, the film makes clear that the law firm for which Brockovich works _could not have won_ without the aid of a big-corporate-baddie lawyer (Peter Coyote) with both money and toxic-torts experience.<p><p>Brockovich doesn't much like this, but it's one of several points on which her knee-jerk, legally inexperienced judgment is simply shown to be wrong. Another is in her initial opposition to binding arbitration, a point handled nicely by Ed Masry (Albert Finney, who is marvelous throughout). And there's another cliche successfully avoided: refreshingly, the fact that Brockovich's &quot;heart is in the right place&quot; doesn't magically make her an expert who out-lawyers the lawyers at every turn.<p><p>It's probably impossible to avoid comparing this film to _A Civil Action_, which involves a somewhat similar set of facts. But unlike that other movie (which heavily fictionalized Jan Schlichtmann in any event), at bottom this is a character study of Brockovich herself. And, presented &quot;warts and all,&quot; she is much more interesting than ideologues in _either_ camp would like to allow.<p><p>She is most assuredly a very refreshing movie hero. Sassy, foul-mouthed, and occasionally downright mean (watch, e.g., her nasty comments to Conchatta Ferrell's character), she is also hard-working, (mostly) responsible, and hungry for justice. No cardboard cutout, she's a complicated person with genuine flaws, and Roberts plays her as such.<p><p>The real fun is in watching her learn to put her &quot;flaws&quot; to work on the side of the good guys. It's a joy to watch her win -- against the usual Hollywood gang of weaselly attorneys (including a condescending Miss Priss who has a hard time believing Brockovich has anything on the ball at all), against PG&amp;E itself, and against the shortcomings that have thus far kept her from success. It's impossible not to like her and root for her.<p><p>A satisfying film overall, then (and one that incidentally succeeds in many respects in which the heavy-handed and absolutely pathetic _Pay It Forward_ fails utterly). Many reviewers will probably disagree with me here, but I hope Julia Roberts never goes back to romantic comedies.</p></body></html>

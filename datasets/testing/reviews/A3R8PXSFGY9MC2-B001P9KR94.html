<meta name="summary" content="Slumdog Millionaire"></head><body><p>`Slumdog Millionaire' is the story of a poor Indian man, who grew up in the slums of Mumbai and who goes on to star in India's version of Who Want to be a Millionaire. It is told in flash backs, with each part of his life history linked to the question being asked on the gameshow. This is a novel way of progressing both stories and explained his motivation to be on the show in the first place. This film was marketed in the trailers as quite a light hearted affair, but in reality it is quite dark in places and very gritty. It shows the harsh life of those born into the slums of India and although it has the rags to riches element to it, you are also shown the more ugly side of a life of poverty. I thought the film was all the better for this and it made for a film with greater weight and depth. Everyone plays their roles very well and the acting is good from child and adult cast alike and the direction is as good as Boyle is renowned for. There is also an excellent Bollywood dance scene at the end credits which made for a delightful way to end the film. This is much better than I anticipated and the darker feel to some aspects lent it a gravitas that only increases it's appeal. This was highly commended and for good reason. This is one well worth watching.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

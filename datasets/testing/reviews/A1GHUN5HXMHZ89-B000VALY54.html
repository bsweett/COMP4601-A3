The movie pokes some fun throughout and it doesn't distract from the story so it enhances the experience. Robert Downey Jr. plays a small time thief that lucks into an audition for a detective movie. When he becomes involved with consulting a real gay detective played by Val Kilmer and a high school crush, things get weird but interesting. The mystery will keep you guessing till the end. I recommend it. Good quality DVD with good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Mr. and Mrs. Smith".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

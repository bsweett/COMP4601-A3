<meta name="summary" content="Great movie!"></head><body><p>I expected to be incredulous, but the screenplay and Howard's attention to crucial setting and details didn't allow for any disbelief. Every aspect of the characters was honed until the stage presence brought the viewer to the edge of the reality/imaginery fold. The story brings out the depth of the dimensions of history and I loved the thrill of chasing the clues (I hadn't read the book yet). Pondering all the assumptions about the possible meanings of different symbols added extra intrique. The screen version certainly doesn't top the novel, but it is a delightful enhancement of a terrific story. Great casting, great directing, great movie!<br /><br />Chrissy K.

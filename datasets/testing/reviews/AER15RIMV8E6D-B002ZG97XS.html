This is one my new favorite movies this year. I love 'time travel' films and was even better because I also love dirty humor. Although it has a cheesy title, I am sure that this film will become a cult classic. Four friends named Adam, Lou, Nick, and Jacob aren't happy with their lives, so they take a trip to the Kodiak Valley ski resort. While partying in a hot tub, they wake up the next morning in the year 1986. They are visited by the mysterious Repair Man who gives them guidelines. They all come to the same conclusion that sometimes you gotta change the past to help make a better future. I highly recommend HOT TUB TIME MACHINE!!!</p></body></html>

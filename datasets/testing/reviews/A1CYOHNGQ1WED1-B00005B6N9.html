Among the survivors is an escaped murderer who was being taken back to prison. They discover an abandoned camp which includes a ship they hope to use to get off the planet. They also discover the planet is inhabited by nasty meat-eating creatures that live in darkness. Figuring they will be ok as there is no night on a planet with 3 suns, they are dealt another blow when a model in the abandoned camp indicates an eclipse is coming. When it starts, the planet it plunged into darkness for a long time and the millions of creatures come above ground. The movie becomes a story of survival as they use any source of light they can find to fend off the creatures to get to the ship and leave the planet.<br /><br />I like the concept of this movie and it does a pretty good job of telling the story although it becomes predictable once the creatures emerge and the survivors have to depend on sociopath Riddick to lead them to safety. Once the creatures are brought into full view they're not that interesting and their is no real suspense. Except for one character, you pretty much knew who was going to live and who was going to die. Overall a worthwhile action/scifi/horror movie.</p></body></html>

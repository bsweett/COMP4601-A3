<meta name="summary" content="A Rip-Roaring Good Time"></head><body><p>As movie thrillers go "Twister" ranks just behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LINC">The Silence of the Lambs (Widescreen Special Edition)</a> in my book.  It has a great cast, a story close enough to real that my belief was easily suspended, and special effects creating a herd of the greatest movie "villains" of all time.<br /><br />Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt play a married couple literally one signature away from divorce.  They are modern meteorologists and their passion is chasing tornadoes.  See, Helen watched a monster storm suck her father out of a storm shelter as a child, and now she is determined to launch "Dorothy" - a scientific data-collection gizmo - into an actual tornado so that the data can be analyzed and a tornado warning system designed based on this data.  This is all back story with a single purpose - put our heroes in the path of several scenery destroying special effects.<br /><br />We catch up with them on a big day - not only has Bill come to get Helen's final signature so that the divorce is final, but a storm's a-brewin'... and it looks like it could be a BIG one.<br /><br />Indeed - well over half of the film is spent in about every variety of "holy SMOKES, wouldn't THIS be cool!" moment the screenwriters and special effects wizards could conjur.  We learn in the expository intervening scenes that Tornadoes go all the way up to a Five on the Fujita scale - and only Helen has ever seen a Five, the one that claimed her father years ago.<br /><br />We get to see tornadoes toss around heavy farm machinery like a puppy playing with a chew toy.  Our heroes are out in the middle of it, of course, trying to put "Dorothy" into the path of the cyclone, and giving us a thrilling up-close look at the eye of the beast.  Like a roller coaster ride, we know that every scene with a breather is going to be followed by the attack of the swirling menace.  The film features a tasty and varied <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002N7W">Twister: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>, with music from Van Halen, Mark Knopfler, k.d. lang and Alison Krauss.  In one of my favorite scenes the storm chasers are taking a breather outside a drive-in movie theater.  Up on the screen we see classic footage from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQJ">The Shining</a>, then we hear the familiar approaching roar.  Then the screen starts ripping apart, first one tile at a time, then finally bursting as the deadly twister again bears down on our heroes.<br /><br />Any film with Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Lois Smith and Cary Elwes in supporting roles has something going for it. (Although British Elwes employs his nearly intolerable "Texas" accent. The version he uses in this 1996 film is not improved the next year in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305127565">Kiss the Girls</a>.  I always thought it ironic since one of the funniest parts of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6BLW4">Robin Hood - Men in Tights</a> was his declaration that "unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent" - harpooning Kevin Costner's dreadful American accent in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630460291X">Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves (Snap Case)</a>. But I digress.)<br /><br />Okay - this movie is not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X9FLKM">The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray</a>] or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBNB6">The Godfather (Widescreen Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.  But it's a doggone entertaining way to spend 113 minutes.</p></body></html>

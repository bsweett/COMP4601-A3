<meta name="summary" content="A Terrific Horror Remake;  Improves Upon The Original"></head><body><p>Of all the many horror remakes over the last few years, I think 2005's "The Fog" may have actually surpassed its source film by the farthest margin.  No disrespect at all to the 1979 original, but this new version is scarier, sexier, made with much higher production values, and in my opinion just plain better.  The characters felt more real to me and more relateable, the tale of the origin of the prescences that are haunting Antonio Bay - which was well-done the first time around - was something I just felt a lot more here and made the whole package more potent.  And the Fog itself, for the first time, actually Looks like what they were apparantly aiming for all along - frightening; a thing that could actually be alive; an actual character in the film instead of just a harbinger of something else.<br /><br />  Near the anniversary of the long-ago founding of Antonio Bay, something is rising from the bottom of the sea, or Returning from it.  Something old, powerful, and vengeful, and something that's going to - over the next few days - catch up not just a few people but the entire population of the island in its violent and mysterious path.  The fog effects are incredibly well done, genuinely scary, and the cinematography throughout the whole movie is outstanding.  One of the few flaws of the movie is that a couple of the characters behave in rather unadvisable manners given the circumstances; fortunately the general likability of most of the characters keeps the occasional lack of brightness from being too glaring a shortcoming.  Or chalk it all up to a hitheto unseen aspect of the fog that lulls those who come into contact with it into a subtly dreamlike state where they abandon their wits temporarily.  Actually, come to think of it, that fits in pretty well with a couple of the scenes in question; maybe it's what the filmmakers were going for all along.<br /><br />  A powerful and unexpected twist ending helps wrap things up in grand fashion.  The trailers for "The Fog" looked good, but the movie itself went way above my expectations.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

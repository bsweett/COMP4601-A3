It is filled with love and pain and regret, and at its conclusion, you will feel all three. Eastwood released it slowly, in a deliberate manner, so that word of mouth would be its advertisement. In its own heartbreaking manner, it might be his best film both as a director and actor.<br /><br />Hilary Swank is magnificent in her down-to-earth role of a young woman with a background she dreams of rising above through boxing. Her determination to make it during times so dire she is relegated to eating leftover food from the plates of others is just one moving moment in a film full of them. This is not the usual Hollywood version of how people survive, but the truth.<br /><br />Eastwood is a legendary trainer and cut-man she hopes will help her achieve her dream. She has the heart but knows he can teach her the skills to make it happen. Morgan Freeman is once again Eastwood's pal, but this time he won the Oscar he deserved for his moving performance. His compassion and understanding of life's regrets is the thread which ties all the pieces of cloth into a quilt, each piece having its own story to tell. His narration, coming at critical junctures in the story is tinged with the sad overview of events from a higher perspective.<br /><br />Eastwood for his part gives a subtle and moving performance as a man with deep regrets over an estranged daughter. His letters are always returned unopened but he keeps sending them nonetheless. It is the spirit and desperation of Swank that will tip the scales in her favor with Eastwood because he sees in her a kindred soul, coming to view her as his own. When she tries but fails to connect with her family after she becomes successful, it is Eastwood who will remain. There is something tender and very real in their understated scene afterwards in the car.<br /><br />A tragedy the viewer does not see coming, and one I will not ruin if you haven't seen this, will shatter dreams and hearts, however. When Eastwood is asked by Swank for something which will take all he has left, you can almost see his heart breaking. Swank simply disappears into her character in the same manner for which Montgomery Clift was famous. Morgan Freeman gives a masterful performance. Eastwood did not get the accolades Freeman and Swank did for their roles, but if you watch closely, you will see a subtle but rough grace to his performance. Only in the film's final moments will we understand how much he cares for her.<br /><br />This is a film elemental but by no means simple. It touched audiences on a human level and was a success without fanfare because it is an all too real slice of life, its truths sometimes painful to watch.<br /><br />Sometimes, when all we have is gone, all that is left us are our memories, and a slice of lemon pie.....</p></body></html>

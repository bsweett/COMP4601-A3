<meta name="summary" content="NO WONDER WHY IT`S NAMED THE BEST EVER"></head><body><p>Last night I found myself in a moviehouse seeing CITIZEN KANE for the very first time. I have 2 admit it:<p>IT IS A DARN GOOD MOVIE<p>The editing/montage in the beginning is 2 my knowledle not surpassed. Orson  Welles comes through as a magnetic presence. Yet, the biggest revelation is  not the high technical standard, but that the film has characters of REAL  flesh and blood. KANE is indeed a REGULAR CITIZEN. Seeing KANE to me was  like meeting myself in the door; a person full of flaws - yes a normal  human being. The other actors are good 2 and it is a real joy 2 see  AAAAAALLL the twists the story contains. I brought with me an 18-year-old  and we saw it as a test... We were both spellbound.<p>It MUST be regarded  as a handbook for young directors, writers, photographers...  THIS IS  T  H E key film for anyone who wants 2 be a part of the medium.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Worthy Chiller/Thriller"></head><body><p>A kind of a cross between &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;, &quot;Identity&quot; still manages to form a pretty decent identity of its own.<p>Beautifully photographed, the film exhibits a richness in style and substance, with some elegantly-designed camera movements.  One final scene in the picture (a daylight scene near an orange grove) really impressed me for its deep, rich color. Just looks great on this Widescreen (2.40:1) presentation of the movie.<p>There's a Full-Screen (1.33:1) version of the film included here as well.  But &quot;Widescreen&quot; is definitely the superior format for this (or any other) motion picture.<p>With an ample supply of twists and turns to keep us guessing, this film (although featuring its fair share of lifeless bodies along the way) rises well above the &quot;slasher&quot; film mentality, providing the viewer with a perfectly reasonable--and realistic--explanation to the events we're seeing on the screen.<p>John Cusack is rock-solid here as a former cop who gets more than he bargained for during a seemingly-routine trip to California.<p>The movie-makers have done a more-than-adequate job of character development for this film. Not an easy task, either, considering we're introduced to more than your average number of principal players (numbering in double digits).<p>In the tradition of a good, old-fashioned scary thriller, &quot;Identity&quot; rises to the occasion and delivers some genuinely eerie moments.<p>It's nice to know that Hollywood still CAN make 'em like this in the 21st Century.</p></body></html>

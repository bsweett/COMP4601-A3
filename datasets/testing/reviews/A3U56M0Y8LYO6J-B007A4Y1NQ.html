Those viewers who have been conditioned to accept only standard narrative fare will find their minds joyfully liberated upon seeing this film.  Sometimes experimentation in cinema does indeed work.  <p>Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a puppeteer who creates unappealing puppets that turn off the public.  His career as a puppeteer is going nowhere so he seeks other employment and soon finds himself working in an office building that has a floor lodged between the seventh and eight floors.  Craig then becomes smitten with co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener), but even more attention-grabbing is a doorway he finds behind a file cabinet that leads into the brain of John Malkovich (John Malkovich playing himself).  Craig uses the doorway for his own selfish pursuits but eventually his wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz), Maxine, and Malkovich himself learn of his exploits.  A metaphysical battle like you have never seen before then ensues in which the fate of John Malkovich's sanity hangs in the balance.  <p>"Being John Malkovich" defies description.  This is a film that people just have to see for themselves.  A second-hand account of it will not do justice to its eccentric and creative nature.  Simply put, "Being John Malkovich" could easily have become a freak-film if it was made by a less-able director, but Jonze manages to keep the entire production afloat from start to finish.  Credit must also be given to Cusack, Diaz, Keener, and Malkovich who are all great in their roles.  Each of them ably captures the peculiar tone that the premise of the film demands of them.  Malkovich is particularly hilarious in a sequence where he discusses his new career as a puppeteer.  Now, it must be said that "Being John Malkovich" is not for everyone.  One must have a somewhat skewed outlook on the world to appreciate the ideas put forth in this film.  If you're willing to check all rational thought at the door and keep an open mind then you will be rewarded with a fascinating and unique viewing experience.  One thing is for sure - after watching "Being John Malkovich," you'll never look at a small door behind a file cabinet the same way again.</p></body></html>

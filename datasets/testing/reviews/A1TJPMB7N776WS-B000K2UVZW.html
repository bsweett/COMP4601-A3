But alas, Swank merely provides a short respite from the unrelenting boredom of this film...as it is way too long and not particularly about the sensational, gruesome and surgical-like, real-life murder of Elizabeth Short (a sad and quite effective Mia Kirschner) in 1947 Los Angeles, the Black Dahlia of the title because she always dressed in black.<br /><br />If De Palma had decided to concentrate on just the murder and the investigation (which still goes on now some 60 years later) he would have had the makings of a, if not great, at least an intriguing film: the basic, true-life  story is rife with mystery, sex, prostitution, kink and white slavery. But instead he has mucked up the film with added elements that do nothing but stray from the basic story and add nothing but silly detail.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson continues her decline (at 20, no less), Josh Hartnett tries his best in a thankless role and Aaron Eckhart chews the scenery not with relish but with a kind of grim, ugly anger that leads you to believe that Eckhart  sensed early on in the filming that he was in a turkey.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" is just a mistake: a bloated, gassy mess of a film. If only David Fincher, once rumored to have been attached to this project, had stuck around we might have had a new Millennium "Chinatown" or "LA Confidential." What we get instead is this embarrassing bore of a film.</p></body></html>

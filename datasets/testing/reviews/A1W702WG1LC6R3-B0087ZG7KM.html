<meta name="summary" content=""Good Comedy That's Not Just A Chick Flick!""></head><body><p>Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne and Melissa McCarthy<br />star in this 2011 comedy. Things go wrong for a woman trying<br />to help plan her best friend's wedding. The cast is great, but<br />Kristen and Melissa steal the film. This dvd not only has nice<br />picture and sound, but rated & unrated versions of the film<br />plus some neat extras. Get this good comedy that's not just<br />a chick flick.</p></body></html>

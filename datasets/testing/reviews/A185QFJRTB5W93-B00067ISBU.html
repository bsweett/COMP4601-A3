<meta name="summary" content="Fun Romp...What's With The Hit/Miss FX???"></head><body><p>Good story if you can get past the crappy beginning.  The FX are awesome in most scenes and then seem trivial and pathetic in others.  Don't get me wrong, overall I liked the movie.  A great comic adaptation, but the average viewier is going to be picking this thing apart.  Okay...you like comics??? RENT, do not buy this movie.  After you see what it offers, make your buying decision.  Personally, the dialogue and creaive charaters (except the main crappy villian) kept me interested enough to RENT a sequel.  It's sad that SO MUCH good movie was damaged by bits and pieces of bad...Still, worth the rental.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Super Awesome Movie"></head><body><p>The kids in this movie can act WAAAYY better than most of hollywood actors/actresses combined. The scene with Elle Fanning made my jaw drop when I watched it in the cinema.  The train wreck scene alone is worth buying this bluray for. To me, this is not a kids movie. As for special features, they made it so fancy that it became annoying. They should have included a "play all" function so I dont have to keep selecting clip after clip (each clip is only a few minutes anyway). In the end I just gave up and continued with another bluray (Platoon; which I also wrote about; awesome movie+bluray). Buy this bluray (Super 8). Platoon too.</p></body></html>

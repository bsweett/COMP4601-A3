<meta name="summary" content="Punisher 2004 8/10 8.5/10 for extended DVD"></head><body><p>Punisher 2004 I have to say is a solid movie with Thomas Jane as Frank Castle also John Travolta plays villain. So it starts off with Frank Castle's last day with the FBI agent & a guy guy is accidentally shot & killed it turns out to be John Travolta's character's son so he want the man dealt with but Travolta's characters wife puts a hit on all of them. While on Family reunion Frank & his wife & kid are there EVERYONE is a target & the men think they killed Frank Castle but he's still alive he returns to Tampa for Revenge & basically to end The Mob lead by John Travolta's character. There are a few flaws I though the Thomas Jane's fight with Kevin Nash was cheesy. I wish it could've been set in New York but I can understand why. I have the Blu Ray version & the longer version the longer version adds 17 minutes that do help a little with the plot. It does Tease a sequel but thanks to LGF,  Lexi Alexader & Ray Stevenson they had to go & f**k it up!</p></body></html>

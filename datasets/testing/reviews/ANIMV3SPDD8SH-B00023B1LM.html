<meta name="summary" content="COOL SPY STUFF"></head><body><p>CIA intrigue, political assasins, an amnesiac hero, cool car chases, a lovely damsel in not too much distress, what more can you ask of a spy thriller based on a Robert Ludlum novel? Stop and breathe for a moment and you may realize this is little more than one long chase scene. But the exotic European locations, and believable if not comic book performances move this along faster than a high speed European railway system. It's all pretty exciting, if not complex. Give a CIA assasin amnesia and all sorts of things are bound to happen. But mostly he'll be chased. There's a conviction here that could wipe the smirk off James Bond's face in a moment.</p></body></html>

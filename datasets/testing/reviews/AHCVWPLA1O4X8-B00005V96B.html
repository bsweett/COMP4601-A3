<meta name="summary" content="Everything Pixar touches is gold"></head><body><p>Unlike their contemporaries at Dreamworks, the folks at Pixar continue to turnout high quality entertainment with excellent special effects and computer animation time after time.  This movie is great for young and old alike.  As opposed to the traditional fairy tale type story, Disney has taken a different approach this time.  Instead of human or animal heroes, we have monsters.  It has the usual entertaining Disney storyline, complete with enough twists and turns to keep it enjoyable.  And, true to form, Disney has made this film both funny and entertaining.  This is a definite keeper, and will be a great addition to anyone's Disney or animated film collection.</p></body></html>

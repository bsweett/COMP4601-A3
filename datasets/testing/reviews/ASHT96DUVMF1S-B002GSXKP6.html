<meta name="summary" content="IT Was GREAT! Beware of Bad Reviews"></head><body><p>... I come to tell you if you like movies such as snatch, thomas crown affair and mission impossible this film is for you. Its a mixed of them all.  <p>... It was great.  Characters where funny and entertaining.  The plot allowed you to get involved.  Throughout the film I keep asking myself how, why and saying that was cool.  Oceans 11 is about ripping off the town that wins no matter how lucky you think you are....Its a group of pros planning and pulling off an intelligent heist.  You will be satisfied.<p>The DVD has a great look at the movie making of the film.  Picture quality is somewhat good.  It has a dark smokey feeling which I guess is the casino aspect.  Sound is also good.  At times I had trouble focusing in on the movie becasue of the picture but I still enjoyed the film.</p></body></html>

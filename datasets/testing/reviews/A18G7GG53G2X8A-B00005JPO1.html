Phone Indy"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg probably felt right at home filming "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," and not only because he reacquainted himself with the title character. This fourth installment of the famous film series also includes extra-terrestrial elements, and I think we all know how successfully Spielberg has tackled that kind of subject matter. But that's the only new component; despite some new locations, a few new characters, and a whole new period of history, "Crystal Skull" is really no different than the first three "Indiana Jones" films. I don't mean this as a put down. If anything, it's the film's greatest strength. Formulaic stories work best in this case; we want Indy to find a supernatural ancient artifact, fight political evils, and keep his hat on during impossible action sequences. We want him to do that, and nothing more.<br /><br />And he delivers. The entire film delivers, not just as a fun-filled, action-packed send up of old time Saturday afternoon movie serials, but also as a cornucopia of impressive special effects. Just about every scene is an eye-popping visual feast, and this perfectly compliments a story this blatantly unrealistic. Producer/story creator George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp unabashedly went all out conjuring up Indy's fourth adventure, a tale of political intrigue and lost civilizations and heretofore-unknown connections with an ancient alien species. Taking place in 1957 at the height of the Red Scare, a much older Dr. Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr. (Harrison Ford) is reintroduced as a captive of the KGB, the covert operatives of the former Soviet Union. Having been betrayed by his long-time partner, "Mac" George McHale (Ray Winstone), Indy is taken to Area 51 and forced to locate a special crate in a gigantic warehouse; the mission leader, Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), believes the crate contains something important, something that will lead the Soviet's to a source of power greater than the world has ever known.<br /><br />Indy, as you probably guessed, energetically escapes this predicament (but not before a wonderful reference is made to an earlier "Indiana Jones" film, and I won't say any more). Unfortunately, the FBI now considers him a Person of Interest, meaning he can no longer teach Archeology. Just as he leaves for New York, he's approached by a tough-talking, knife-wielding young bike-rider named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). He needs Indy's help; both his mother and his friend, Professor Oxley, have been kidnapped by the Soviets. All Mutt can give Indy is one of Oxley's notes, written in a dead South American language and serving as a way to find one of thirteen skulls made entirely of crystal.<br /><br />Apparently, Oxley is an expert on crystal skulls, real-life ancient artifacts mysterious both in structure and origin. If, like me, you had never even heard of crystal skulls before this movie, here's a little background info: archeologists have discovered a number of crystal skulls over the years throughout Mexico, Central America, and South America. The most famous skull was the one supposedly found by Anna Mitchell-Hedges back in 1924, sculpted from a block of clear quartz. Claimed to predate all known Colombian Mesoamerican artifacts, the craftsmanship remains a mystery to this day; not only was it sculpted against the natural grain of the crystal, it also shows no evidence of chipping or scratching, and this is virtually impossible considering the primitive tools used by early civilizations. This led to myths about the skull having supernatural powers, being able to radiate psychic energy and possibly being of alien origin.<br /><br />Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's get back to the movie. Indy's and Mutt travel to Peru and find a half-insane Oxley (John Hurt) and Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Indy's old flame from "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Naturally, they also find Spalko and her Soviet goons. This kick starts a frenetic race to a temple deep within the jungles of Brazil, where the final climactic scenes take place. You can rest assured that all this is loaded with action, with sequences including a swordfight atop two moving army vehicles, Mutt swinging from vines with a pack of monkeys, and three gigantic waterfalls, all of which Indy, Marion, and Mutt go down. Never mind the fact that they survive--as they climb out of the water, we immediately realize that Indy's hat remained in place the entire time.<br /><br />If the excitement and fun of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" left a definite impression on you, then you're well on your way to loving every minute of "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." The plot may be original, but the spirit hasn't changed a bit, and that's exactly the way it should be; each of the four films is a masterpiece of escapist entertainment. We have a hero to root for, even if he's afraid of snakes (and just watch what happens when he has to climb out of a sinking sand trap). We have villains to jeer, and just as the Nazis of the first and third films were goofy caricatures, so too are the Soviets in this film. "Crystal Skull" goes one step further by paying homage to the previous films, specifically by mentioning the passing of both Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery) and Marcus Brody (the late Denholm Elliot). We also get to see man-eating ants, and what "Indiana Jones" film would be complete without a swarm of creepy crawlies? There's no question that "Raiders" is the best of the series, but there's also no denying that "Crystal Skull" is a fun, worthy addition. I expected nothing less.</p></body></html>

The very idea of my favorite actress and my favorite up-and-comer was an irresistible combination. However, this usually means that I am setting myself up for failure or disappointment (expecting too much); so I waited anxiously for _Closer's_ release. I have to say first that I was terrified by the reviews and reports of people leaving the theater early and demanding their money back. However, now I that I have seen the movie, I can clearly say that those people either did not pay attention to the movie's subject before deciding to see it, or they left their brains at home that day. The film was excellent. Portman and Owen were brilliant and heartbreaking almost to the point that I would say they were robbed of the Oscars (Portman was, I have not seen MDB yet). Roberts and Law were very good as well, although their parts were not as likeable (on purpose, they were the "bad guys") or intricate as the other two. This is another classic example of how a good supporting cast can make a film, and one of the first films I have seen where it seems that the supporting characters were more important than the leading ones. Anyway, the storyline is simple: tragedy in love, but the ending does provide some absolution, for the likeable characters at least. But it is the acting that will be remembered, the heartbreak in Portman's face, and Julia's sad eyes always begging for an answer or a way out. Owen's forcible way of dealing with things, with simmers of hurt shinning through. If you look through the bad language and zooming narrative, this film will be a gift.</p></body></html>

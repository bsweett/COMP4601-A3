I am not going to say bad things about them, but who ever wrote what could've been the corniest script since Gigli. &quot;Are you a MexiCAN or a MexiCAN't&quot;  After an hour of torment I could'nt take it.  I swear, I think Fidel Castro even hates this movie.  The action was so often it got boring.  The plot was very very unintriguing.  Definately a don't see film.</p></body></html>

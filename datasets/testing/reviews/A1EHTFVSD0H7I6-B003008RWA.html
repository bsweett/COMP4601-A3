<meta name="summary" content="Nauseating Reveal. Houston, We Do Have a Problem"></head><body><p>Whoa. I work in health care and I am very aware of some of the screwed-up issues out there. I see physicians' hands tied by insurance companies, I see physicians' costs for liability insurance climbing and payment for health care declining. Even with that insider knowledge, Sicko curled my toes. I'm sure there are two sides of the story. But I don't see the other side in my day job and Sicko opens the flood gates on horror stories. I cried and I grew enraged at the stories that were shared in this documentary. I do not agree with the cover endorsement that mentions laughter, don't think this is rollicking comedy. Sure, there is a hint of humor, but the situations shared are tragedies.<br /><br />Methodically Moore reveals the process of health insurance from application to final payment or non-payment of claims. If you hate the big business mind set and profit hunger of insurance companies and are currently insured in case you have an increase in blood pressure, you'll want to watch this film. He then investigates why we are in the situation we are, and how other countries handle health care. If you are a documentary fan, this is quite a film.<br /><br />Moore has strong opinions. I've only seen Bowling for Columbine and Sicko but in Moore's world Canada seems to hold the answers to America's problems. The American political system/government is painted as corrupt, even a segment on Hilary Clinton that begins with her as the misunderstood warrior for health care reform ends with her political campaign being financed in part by health care dollars. Moore travels the world and digs deep into the issues that are part of the problem.<br /><br />Sicko tells a horrific story. But it's a story that is one that needs to be looked into and not ignored.</p></body></html>

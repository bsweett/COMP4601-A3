<meta name="summary" content="Still Pretty Good"></head><body><p>Im one of the old geezers who remember when this movie was all people were talking about. I picked up the DVD version on an impulse and find this movie is still pretty intense. Lots of blood and gore for those of us who like it and who doesnt love Pinhead? The DVD quality is good with an option for widescreen or fullscreen and THX did a great job on the sound as well. Very well done and quite creepy.</p></body></html>

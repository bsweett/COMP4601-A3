<meta name="summary" content="Denzel Washington's Finest Hour - So Far"></head><body><p>MAN ON FIRE is a brilliant film for many reasons: the script by Brian Helgeland is right up  there with his 'Mystic River' and 'LA Confidential', the direction by Tony Scott delivers an almost unbearable exposition of violence and evil while equally metering that aspect with some of the finest moments of acting from his cast that they have ever given, the cinematography is color saturated and creatively shot and edited in a way that propels the force of the story in a Grand Guignol manner, and last - the acting by the principals (and the supporting roles) is first rate.  Briefly, Creasy (Washington) is a burned out alcoholic victim of sensory devastation from being a special ops assassin for the US Intelligence and is called by his old comrade in arms Rayburn (Christopher Walken - in a dynamically rich characterization) to take on the role of bodyguard in Mexico City for a wealthy family's (Marc Anthony ad Radha Mitchell) precocious daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning, who continues to mature into a very fine actress).  Mexico City is seeing kidnapping at an all time high and the 'police force' is so corrupt that everyone is in jeopardy.  Yes, Pita is kidnapped and Creasy, despite severe bodily injury at the time he attempts to abort the kidnapping, recovers and spends his life 'on fire' with revenge, destined to kill everyone who had anything at all to do with what he feels is the death of Pita.  The reason this story works so very well is the powerful, though slow, process of Creasy allowing himself to find spiritual redemption in the love of Pita, a child with more healing powers in her indomitable nature than a legion of nuns and priests.  This relationship as created by Washington and Fanning through Scott's cautious eye is one of the more beautiful definitions of 'friendship' ever filmed.<br /><br />The supporting cast is peppered by both luminaries and newcomers and each gives full throttle performances that never fall into excess:  Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin, and the already mentioned Chistopher Walken, Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell.  Yes, this is a violent film: our world is a violent place and when money reigns over right/wrong situations, impossibly terrible things can happen.  Yet, violent though this film is, I feel that violence and the way in which it is depicted and manipulated by the camera is justified to shake the audience into accepting facts we don't want to see.  If Oscars have not been pre-decided, then Washington and Fanning are definitely candidates.  A very fine film that leaves you drained.</p></body></html>

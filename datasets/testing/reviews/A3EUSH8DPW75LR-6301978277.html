<meta name="summary" content="Review of the blu ray version"></head><body><p>SOME LIKE IT HOT is a classic for many reasons.  The film may seem a little dated to some viewers but what keeps it forever great and irresistible are the superb performances by Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe.  Filming it in black and white helped greatly to believe the two men being accepted as women.  And it also helped make Marilyn stand out even more with her effervescent and transcendent beauty.  But when looking at a blu ray version of a film that has seen much life on dvd a buyer must know if double dipping is really worth it.  Especially where SOME LIKE IT HOT came out with a superb dvd transfer years ago.<br /><br />To put it simply, the film honestly looks and sounds great on blu ray and is a vast improvement over even its best dvd transfer.  There is much clarity improvement in the video and the crispness in detail is vivid.  Facial closeups are particular standouts.  The black and white ratio is perfect and the film has not been overly enhanced or tried to be cleaned up as blu rays often are.  The intended grainess is still there which adds character to the film.  But seeing Tony and Jack in their female getup with the picture so clear is amazing and nothing can surpass how Marilyn comes across in this blu ray version.  When she first walks by the train and the steam comes out you know what picture perfection you are in for.  And every time her face appears, be it out of a train sleeping bunk or just entering a scene you can see every feature and fine detail of her face in all its glory.  The picture takes on its own life when she is singing I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU.  Just the spotlight highlighting her face whenever she sings is your proof of the blu ray improvement.  The sensual gift and aura that was Marilyn Monroe takes full advantage of the blu ray.<br /><br />And the audio is a huge improvement.  The audio now is in a DTS Master 5.1 and the sound will come out all your speakers gloriously.  And again the highlights are Marilyn's songs.  Sadly the extras here are exactly the same as on the last dvd release.  Luckily the retail price of this film is not high.  Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and particularly Marilyn give career highlight performances and it is amazing to believe the difficulties they had filming due to Marilyn's insecurities.  With this film you get a fun farce with endearing performances that stand the test of time.  And the blu ray is a must if you are a fan of the film or anyone in it.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

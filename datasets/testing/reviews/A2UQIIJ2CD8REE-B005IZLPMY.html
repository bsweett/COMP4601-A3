Unfortunately, he is also exceptionally small, weak, and asthmatic. But, when a particular scientist takes note of his determination and amazing goodness, Steve is recruited to be the subject of a groundbreaking super-soldier experiment that transforms him into "Captain America: The First Avenger". From there on, we follow Captain Rogers as he struggles to take his fight from the home front propaganda circuit to the battle overseas, where he finds himself up against the original guinea pig of the super soldier syrum, the megalomaniacal Red Skull, leader of Hydra, an organization formerly tied to the Nazis, but now running purely under Red Skull's control.<br /><br />When I first went to see 2011's "Captain America: The First Avenger", I was pretty psyched. I've never been a reader of the comics, but I've always been a fan of the more famous superheroes due to being a huge cartoon and film fanatic. There is a derogatory term comic fans have for such screen-based superhero fans as myself, but I can't remember it just now (for the record, I have always read comics, just not superhero ones; I would like to catch up with them someday). I've been a huge fan of the Marvel films since they started up with the X-Men, Spider-Man, Hulk, and Fantastic Four franchises, and things really got kicked up a notch when "Iron Man" came along as the first in this line of films leading up to the currently in theaters "The Avengers".  All 5 preceding films and The Avengers itself have been excellent to varying degrees, but "Captain America", in my opinion, is one of the best. This is largely due to the excellent casting, performances, retro-styling, music, and great Joe Johnston direction (this is the man who gave us The Rocketeer, another great, retro superhero film, as well as other excellent works like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, which I still love to revisit on DVD). Now, when I first saw the film, I have to admit, I was more enthralled by the first two thirds than the final act. That's not to say there is anything wrong with that final act, but knowing only a limited amount about Captain America going into the film, both myself and my date expected it to be a bit more superhero-ish than it was. It was really more military offensive type stuff. Totally appropriate and well done, but for us, who are not war movie types, the story of Steve Rogers' transformation into Captain America and the relationships he makes were more fascinating. Rewatching the film more thoroughly on Blu-Ray, however, without being partially focused on how much my date was enjoying the film, ha, I find the later portion of the film much more engaging than I originally thought, and the whole thing is just a masterfully done piece of entertainment. Again, though my knowledge about the characters is limited, they seem wonderfully translated to the big screen. Nothing hokey looking about Red Skull at all, and Hugo Weaving is fantastic in the role! Chris Evans in the lead could not be better, either, and the special affects used to make him appear puny in the first part of the film are just amazing (they look much better in 2D than in 3D, as I remember seeing it on the big screen). Hayley Atwell does a wonderful job as Cap's love interest and military superior, Peggy Carter, and  it's great to see Tommy Lee Jones in the Marvel cast of characters here too, playing a hard (on the outside) Colonel as perfectly as you'd expect him to. There are plenty of other noteworthy cast members (always enjoy Toby Jones in films, and Stanley Tucci as well, he brings so much to this film), but it really is enough to say that everyone is excellent (and one of those Captain America chorus girls always catches my eye, but I won't take the space to try to specify which one).<br /><br />"Captain America" is a fantastic film, particularly because of the great job it does with the retro qualities and bringing such potentially campy characters to life without slipping into that hole even slightly. Most of the Avengers-fueling films have done a great job with that, and I hope D.C. takes a lesson from this and starts working towards a proper Justice League film (though I have great concern, as they have yet to prove they can get the balance just right, no matter how awesome the Nolan Bat films are). Oh, and on the subject, I just love how all these films have been tied together (who hasn't loved that?), with S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, Stark Enterprises (Dominic Cooper is a hoot in this as a young Howard Stark, Iron Man's dad),  and Phil Coulson popping up everywhere. The Blu-Ray is a must have if you are a Marvel fan or even just a fan of Word War II era films. It is brilliant in both respects. The movie looks and sounds great, and it comes with a fine set of bonus features: The best of the Marvel One-Shot short films (A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer), a collection of featurettes and trailers, some deleted scenes, and a commentary by Director Joe Johnston, Director of Photography Shelly Johnson, and Editor Jeffrey Ford. The commentary is not the most fascinating one I've heard, but still good, and the featurettes are great as behind the scenes material. If you were a fan of "The Avengers" and plan to buy it when it comes out, you need to own this one too, and I certainly hope you've seen it by now. Don't forget to pick up Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor, and The Incredible Hulk as well! That's the Edward Norton "Incredible Hulk", not the Eric Bana "Hulk", though I still say Bana's is a good film too, even if it's not AS good.<br /><br />PS: As a bit of extra, interesting info I just looked into, aside from animated works, Captain America has been onscreen in two 1979 TV movies (now on DVD), and on the big screen in a 1944 serial and a 1990 film not released in the States except on VHS. It seems the general consensus is that none of these are very good, though I still wanna see them and would love to own the serial if they'd ever release it. Anyway, thankfully, we now have a truly great Captain America film in "Captain America: The First Avenger", not to mention "The Avengers", and "Captain America 2" is scheduled for 2014.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An improvement from the first film, but that's not saying much."></head><body><p>THE DA VINCI CODE was easily one of the most lackluster action thrillers in recent ages.  To be fair, the movie didn't have much going for it: miscasting in the lead role (Hanks is great, don't get me wrong, but he's not fit for thrillers); a short time frame (to cash in on the book's popularity); and a rather mediocre source novel (let's face it, Dan Brown isn't a literary master; he's just good at pushing buttons).  The film had some good supporting performances, but overall it simply wasn't as good as a Ron Howard film should be.<br /><br />ANGELS & DEMONS is an improvement from that.  The film is pretty much a nonstop race to stop the religious terrorist organization Illuminati from setting off an anti-matter bomb.  It picks up quickly and never rests.  It isn't quite as good as the book--the novel, while no great piece of literature, is a decent-enough thriller, and far better than its sequel--but let's blame that on the PG-13 rating; the novel was gory and dark, with a truly haunting premise and enough truth-bending "facts" to make for a thoughtful (if not accurate) thrill ride.  The film has toned it down a bit, honing the dark, rough edges to make it a little more palatable for movie-going audiences.  And sure, it still doesn't feel like a Ron Howard film (anybody could have made this); and sure, Tom Hanks is STILL miscast; but we have three great supporting roles--from Stellan Skarsgard, Ewen McGreggor, and Armin Mueller-Stahl--and enough action for us to forgive the fact that the movie doesn't go as far with its subject as it should.<br /><br />Of course, thrillers like this--where the facts are bent, where the action and cliched dialogue is laid on so thick that close inspection of the details is all but impossible--have their audience, and ANGELS & DEMONS delivers to that audience in spades.  So, in those regards, this film is definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre.  If, on the other hand, you're like me and just wanted to kill two hours with some mindless entertainment, you can see this one or not; you won't be missing much, but it is, if nothing else, entertaining.  Perhaps that's the best we can expect from mainstream Hollywood these days.  (Though we certainly expect more from Ron Howard.)</p></body></html>

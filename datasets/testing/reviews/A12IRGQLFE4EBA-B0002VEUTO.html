Vin Diesel is not much of an actor ... while I think he is attractive to look at, I don't expect much from him other than a good action flick.  That being said, this movie was interesting.  The set and costume designs were beautiful, grand and vast.  The story line was interesting; and the acting was ok.  Better than I expected.  This is worth being in your collection and if other "chronicles" will be brought to the big screen, all the better to start your collection off right!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of my TOP 10 favorite movies: Sheldon Jeffrey Sands is the man !"></head><body><p>You might detect a bit of Jack Sparrows, for a moment, in Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.  I love this movie.  The trailers enticed me with Salma Hayek, and I had loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZU1">Desperado (Special Edition)</a>. Therefore I caught this on the big screen, then rented it...then I knew I had to purchase the film.<br /><br />Oddly, I rooted for Antonio Banderas all throughout <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZTY">El Mariachi (Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZU1">Desperado (Special Edition)</a>, and the beginning of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000WN140">Once Upon a Time in Mexico</a>...then along came Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.<br /><br />Although I must fault Sheldon Jeffrey Sands for allowing his ego to overwhelm his good judgment, and his nether regions to overrule his brainpan, he is the man.  A bit too smug, his Ego sometimes screws up his plans.  Yet I am hoping for a comeback.<br /><br />If they want us to root for "the good guy," they can't make "the bad guy" so damned cool.  You just have to see the movie, and watch how SJS sets things up to watch them fall.  You can purchase the trilogy: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ASDFI6">Robert Rodriguez Mexico Trilogy (El Mariachi / Desperado / Once Upon A Time In Mexico)</a>.  I am hoping for a part four.</p></body></html>

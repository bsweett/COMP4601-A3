I've been involved with counseling many couples who break up and this movie hits the proverbial nail right on the head.  Many break ups are "accidental".  Many times persons who break up wish they could be back together.  Many times the greatest danger comes when the problems are out in the open and persons attempt to save the relationship.<br /><br />All of the cast does a good job.  The characters are believable and make the viewer root for them, even the supporting cast.  The viewer becomes emotionally glued to this film with a desire for these two to make it, but they always seem to just miss, even though both want it to work.  This could be a healing film, but it is not a "feel good" film.  This may be why so many viewers, expecting a light hearted comedy, gave it less than stellar reviews.<br /><br />Most people who have experienced the breakup of a close relationship will see themselves in this film.  About half of all marriages end in divorce and most couples who live together will eventually split.  The brightest spot in the film is the ending.  It reminds us that however relationships turn out, there is hope for a future on the other side.<br /><br />I won't say how this film turns out, but if you do not like the ending there is an alternate ending in the bonus features.  I liked the ending that showed in the theatres, but the other ending is worth a glance, if only for a few laughs.</p></body></html>

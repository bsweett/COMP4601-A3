The media was focused on the hysterical rage of the gay community that flared up when CRASH was announced as the winner but you could also see the collective sigh of relief filling the auditorium when Nicholson called something other than BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.<br /><br />Despite all the hype and the huge media push, in spite of all the blogs and message boards where gays brag about inflating the box office by seeing the movie a half-dozen times a week (or weekend), I don't think America wants to see this movie.  I live in a blood Red state filled with cowboys and NOT A ONE wanted to see this movie.<br /><br />It's about gay sheepherders.  Or they think they're gay sheepherders, although they keep telling each other they're not.  One wife finds out they're gay...but she doesn't say anything (that's in a perfect world, folks, because I've known wives who found out their husbands were gay and it was a cross between Jerry Springer and Armageddon.  Think about it: would the wives be so understanding if their hubbies were bunking up with a cowgirl?).<br /><br />The movie would've been more interesting if the two cowboys HADN'T been gay but everyone else THOUGHT they were.  They continue on their fishing and riding trips over the years and their families are gossiping and snickering while nothing sexual is happening between them.<br /><br />As it is, re: the fate of these two guys, I was waiting for Monty Python's Church Police to show up and "arrest Society...since society's to blame!"  It's like the Matthew Sheperd crime: nobody cares what someone does, just don't go hitting on drunken rednecks.<br /><br />And I'm still not ready to completely forgive Ang Lee for ruining THE HULK.</p></body></html>

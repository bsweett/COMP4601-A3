<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Films of 2005"></head><body><p>I hate war movies. I always have, always will. Having said that, I rarely watch war movies and have never seen such war movies as "Apocolypse Now" or "Platoon". The only reason I saw this movie was because I like Sam Mendes. Sam Mendes is an Oscar winning director (Best Director, American Beauty) and is fairly obscure. He's only directed three movies in 6 years. He carefully picks each film he does and this movie is no exception. The problem is, this movie has been unjustly billed as a war movie and it's not. It's the story of men at war in the Desert. But never do we see battle sequences portrayed in movies like "Saving Private Ryan", "Full Metal Jacket", or even "Cold Mountain". This movie is extremely entertaining, the performances are great, it's funny, and it's probably one of the biggest Oscar snubs of 2005. Hell, this movie is better than "Capote" and "Good Night, And Good Luck". Anyway, the movie is based on a memoir by Anthony Swofford, played here by Oscar nominee Jake Gylenhaal (Best Supporting Actor, Brokeback Mountain). The movie opens with Swofford (or Swoff) in boot camp. The boot camp is instantly reminiscent of the one in "Full Metal Jacket" except R. Lee Ermey doesn't show up and make us laugh our a$$es off. The Boot Camp scenes are entertaining, but short lived. Swoff is transferred to the Camp Pendleton Marine Base where he meets Troy (Peter Sarsgaard, in another underappreciated performance), Kruger (Lucas Black, the kid with the weird accent from "Sling Blade"), Fergus (Brian Heraghty), Fowler (Evan Jones, better known as Cheddar Bob from "8 Mile" who seems to be playing the miltary version of that character), and Staff Sargeant Sykes (Oscar winner Jamie Foxx). Eventually, Swoff and the other men mentioned are transferred to Iraq for Operation: Desert Shield. If you're expecting them to arrive in Iraq and begin shooting Iraqui's left and right, then this isn't your kind of movie. For some odd reason, that's why I like this movie so much. It's a war movie, without being a war movie. Besides the entertainment factors, there's also the political aspect of this film. It couldn't have came out at a better time. This movie takes place when George Bush Sr.was in office, but all the events in this movie could be taking place right now. When Bush Sr. was President, the troops were fighting in Iraq. Now, Bush Jr. is in office and the troops are fighting in Iraq. Do I see a pattern here? Anyway, as I said before this movie is also pretty damn funny. The showing of "The Deer Hunter" scene was hilarious, to me anyways, and the comment Fowler makes in the shower was pretty funny. All the performances are standout; Including Gylenhaal, Foxx, Sarsgaard, Black, and Jones in no particular order. The reason Oscar ignored this film was because it was overshadowed by movies like Capote, Crash, and Brokeback Mountain. Allthough the last two are better movies. Anyway, I highly recommend this movie and it's one of the better films of 2005.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

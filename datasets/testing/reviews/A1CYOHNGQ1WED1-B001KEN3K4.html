<meta name="summary" content="Funny, but not a classic like the show"></head><body><p>Get Smart is based on the classic 1960s sitcom starring Don Adams as Maxwell Smart and Barbara Feldon as agent 99. In the movie Steve Carrell as Smart is Control's top analyst but he wants to be an agent. He finally gets his chance when Control agents all over the world are attacked at once by KAOS and they are left short handed. So agent 86 goes on his first mission with agent 99 played by Ann Hathaway.<br /><br />The cast play their parts with verve and their are several laugh out loud moments in the movie, but it doesn't sustain the laughs throughout. People who didn't watch the TV show may like it more. I loved the old show and found the differences off-putting. Don Adams played Smart with a bumbling arrogance. Carrell is a brilliant comedic actor but he played Smart so straight he had almost no personality. Barbara Feldon's 99 was smart and confident but also vulnerable. Hathaway's 99 was self-centered and abrasive at times. Get Smart is a funny movie but not a classic like the TV show.</p></body></html>

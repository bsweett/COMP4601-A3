Probably one of the greatest mob films along with Coppola's 'Godfather' films bringing all the action and drama of life with the Italian mob.<br /><br />The film follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his associates played by Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  Joe Pesci gives probably one of the most memorable performances in his career and the film as the sociopathic Tommy DeVito: "You think I'm funny?"<br /><br />I can't find a single defect in this gripping film. Every aspect of the film was done with the traditional brilliance of Martin Scorsese.  Great script, direction, and acting make this film one which you can watch over and over without ever getting tired.  Definitely a film that should be in every wiseguy's collection.</p></body></html>

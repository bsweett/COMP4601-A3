It's meant to be an adrenaline rush, a cavalcade of fights and wow special effects.  Who cares about Alice's past?  We get enough from the first movie to fill us in.  This movie delivers what you should expect from this kind of moviemaking.  Milla Jovovich kicks butt in this one, which I think overall is better than the original, which seemed to be nothing more than an extended video game.  This time around we get Alice paired up with the likes of Mike Epps, Oded Fehr, Sienna Guillory and others.  Thomas Krestchmann who was so good in THE PIANIST makes an interesting villain.  There's lots of explosive action and twists and turns.  Its dark ending squeals for a third installment.  So relax enjoy this movie's mindlessness and appreciate the craft that was necessary to pull it off so nicely.</p></body></html>

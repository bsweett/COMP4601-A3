<meta name="summary" content="And another one..."></head><body><p>I firmly believe that the best thing Pierce Brosnan ever did was retire from playing James Bond.  Sure, he was great at it, but his career was better than the hokey movies his Bond flicks turned out to be.  Yeah, they have some merit, and overall they are entertaining, but this is a new age and a new Bond was needed, and the material that Brosnan was getting was just beneath him.  I mean, most people don't even realize that Pierce Brosnan is a good actor; but he is!<br /><br />That said, this was his final run as the legendary womanizing secret agent, and it's certainly fun in its own right.  Brosnan still holds firm to the character he created in the mid-90's, not skipping a beat.  He's every bit as influentially charming as he was ten years prior.<br /><br />In this installment, Brosnan (er, Bond) finds himself saddled between two sexy young things in the bodies of Halle Berry (yeah, Oscar be darned...I'm doing a Bond movie) and Rosamund Pike (by god, this woman has bloomed into one amazing actress over the past few years).  Go figure, Bond has to contend with hot women.  So, the villain is as unbelievable as the last one, and the hookups are outrageously twisted (in that Bond always has a knack for sleeping with the enemy that is almost surely pretending to be the friend).  The final catfight is worth the wait, despite its overt campiness.  It's that campiness that I was referring to in the outset of this review.  I'm glad that the reigns have been passed over, and despite the fact that the last Bond film wasn't as successful as `06's `Casino Royale', I strongly feel that the new direction is exactly what was needed to revamp interest in this decades old character.<br /><br />Brosnan and his lady friends (including Dench, who was so born to play M) are all in fine form here, and the special effects and action sequences are up to Bond standards; and yet, the film is rather forgettable when you get passed it all.<br /><br />It's fun, but nothing special.</p></body></html>

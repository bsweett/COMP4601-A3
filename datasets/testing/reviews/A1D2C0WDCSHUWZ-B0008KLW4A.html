<meta name="summary" content="Cat-astrophe"></head><body><p>In the wild world of cinema, we're living in an age of comic heroes -- Spiderman, Hellboy, Daredevil, the Hulk, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and now... &quot;Catwoman.&quot;?Sadly, this film is just an excuse to have Halle Berry purr around in a leather dominatrix outfit.<br /><br /> Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a mild-mannered, rather dull woman in an ordinary job at a massive cosmetics firm. But one day she has the misfortune to hear her bosses talking about a new beauty product -- it causes the skin to disintegrate if you stop using it, but they don't plan to recall it. But when Patience is caught, they kill her and flush away her body in a wash of toxic waste. Enter Egyptian deity cat, who resurrects her and endows her with catty powers and a new punky attitude.<br /><br /> Like any superhero worth her scanty leather catsuit (no pun), the reborn Catwoman wants to kick the behinds of the people who did this to her. But her ex-boss Laurel Hedare (past-her-prime ex-bombshell Sharon Stone) has a secret of her own -- cosmetic cream that makes her skin hard (Botox, anyone?). Can Catwoman thwart the evildoers? Will anyone care?<br /><br /> It's difficult to understand why the talented, beautiful, Oscar-winning Halle Berry would attach herself to this ghastly, almost unredeemable story. There is literally nothing worth checking out in &quot;Catwoman,&quot; unless you happen to be a hormone-raddled teen boy whose only plot requirement involves Berry in kitty dominatrix gear. (Complete with whip!)<br /><br /> The dialogue is truly horrendous. Berry is reduced to reciting lame one-liners like &quot;I'm bad, but only as bad as I wanna be.&quot; Director Pitof relies heavily on T&A shots of Berry bouncing around and slinking seductively over rooftops, not to mention the bad CGI shots. Perhaps worst of all, Pitof overuses the silly &quot;cat&quot; element -- we're treated to shots of Berry sleeping on the roof, licking up tuna, snorting catnip. It's funny, but not meant to be.<br /><br /> Berry really does seem to be trying. But she can't hope to overcome the script and direction, It's all the more tragic because she has the presence and smoldering quality to make the role sexy and complex. Benjamin Bratt is utterly forgettable as Catwoman's cop boyfriend. And Sharon Stone's big comeback just reaffirms the obvious: She can't act. She struts through every scene reciting her lines in a robotic voice (&quot;Now I can... kill you.&quot;)<br /><br /> &quot;Catwoman&quot; is a cat-astrophe. With ghastly acting -- despite the best efforts of Berry -- a putrid script and a ridiculous director, this is undoubtedly among the worst films of 2004.</p></body></html>

We turn on the lights without a second thought; we light matches without a moment's hesitation. Water coming out of the faucet is a given, something we know we can always depend on to be there. &quot;Cast Away&quot; takes all of those securities and hides them away, leaving us with an incredible and harrowing story of survival and determination. <p>Taking its time in getting to what the movie is all about, the story first begins with the frenzied life of Fed-Ex systems engineer Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), whose number-one rule of life is making sure that everything goes according to schedule. This leaves him little time for his understanding girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt), whom he returns to see in Memphis for Christmas. Circumstances intervene, and he finds himself rearranging his schedule in order to make a trip across the Pacific for business. But not before exchanging gifts, one of which is an engagement ring, the other an &quot;I'll be right back.&quot;<p>After a near-10-minute plane crash sequence that raises the intensity, the true Zemeckis style kicks into gear, as Chuck is left in a rubber life raft in stormy seas, the only light source coming from sudden flashes of lightning. At daylight, he finds himself on an island, not another soul in sight and only the sound of crashing waves and wind in the trees for company. Instincts drive him to signal for help at first, and as the days move on, he silently realizes his situation. <p>The story becomes more intriguing with the transition of time during his stay on the island: he learns the secrets of creating life's little commodities. Resorting to stick-rubbing for the creation of fire and collection condensation from leaves for nourishment, the only visible objects that tie his present life to reality are a Fed-Ex box, his battered life-raft, and a volleyball with a blood-painted face whom he calls Wilson. But as Chuck becomes more attached to life on the island, he cannot shake his desire to once again return home to his love, whose picture he repeatedly paints on the wall. <p>Let's be honest: this is probably the best deserted island movie to date, possibly ever made. &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; was less engrossing because there was a family on the island, not a single person. Being alone on the island allows the story to explore the inner human strength and spirit, as well as new methods of companionship. <p>Other techniques bring the movie to a full-force magnitude that keeps us engrossed with what goes on. During the entire island sequence, from the time he arrives to the time he is plucked from the sea, there is a complete absence of music. This leaving out of the musical score gives an added focus to his situation as well as reflecting on his solitude and loneliness. The nature surrounding Chuck is beautifully captured and photographed, and under Zemeckis's helm, the setting is ominous and brooding without becoming too overpowering. <p>Hanks gives, without a doubt, the best performance to date of his career, topping his work in &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot; His acting, along with the aforementioned techniques, puts us right there with him as he begins to learns the small things in life can be quite complicated. Even his silence is our key to understanding his realizations about the potential danger he faces, and his comprehension of what seems to him an inescapable situation. At the movie's end, I felt compelled to inquire why Russell Crowe received the Best Actor Oscar for his work in &quot;Gladiator,&quot; when the performance by Hanks is much more involving. <p>But, like any good movie, there are flaws. Luckily, this movie escaped fairly unscathed, until the ending, however. At movie's end, it loses the same luster it had before, and the return to reality and the emotional challenges he will face are less intriguing or involving as those presented in the midsection of the story. And the silence experienced for so long seems shaken in a bad way once everything begins to round itself out. <p>Nonetheless, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is a compelling tale spun from the director of &quot;Contact,&quot; who tells the story the way it needs to be told. Hanks brings his best screenwork to the movie, while the entire effect of the movie is one of sheer awe and enamoration. Did you ever wish you were on a deserted island with someone else? You may just think twice.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's the Pitts"></head><body><p>Whoever said Brad Pitt was just a pretty boy? Here he shows a mastery of comic timing. Every word that comes out of his mouth is totally incoherent. Marvelous! This film has "Pulp Fiction" stamped all over it. They sell the screenplay to "Pulp Fiction" in the classics sections of bookstores in England, believing it comparable to "Bleak House" and "Macbeth." This film was made in the shadow of Tarantino's enormous influence on the Brits who love the antics of down and outers. It has many wonderful bits, combining a kind of Scorsese brutality with a Marx Brothers hilarity. It doesn't quite match its model for invention or genius but it is a lot of fun. It also has the virtue of being politically incorrect and is a tad less romantic than Tarantino's picture, which I remember as cloyingly optimistic. There's been a string of these goofy gangster flicks lately coming out of the UK, all with small-picture scope, but with big-movie acting. All one can do is hope for more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A must see"></head><body><p>The Last King of Scotland is both a showcase of superb acting performances and a taught, suspensful thriller. I highly recommend adding it to your collection.<br /><br />Few people are familiar with Idi Amin, not one of the 20th Century's more famous dictators, but extremely bloody with an estimated 300,000 Ugandans killed under his regime. Forrest Whittaker deserves his oscar as the paranoid, playful despot capturing the ruthless side but also, most difficult, his playful side. There are superb moments such as when the dictator's eyes light up at the sight of Dr Garrigan's Scotland vest and he impishly declares his son is called Campbell in honour of his love of Scotland.<br /><br />McAvoy is also superb as Dr Garrigan, a naive and cocksure young Scottish doctor who becomes embroiled in the terror, paranoia and corruption of Amin's regime, and there are masterful support roles, most notably Simon McBurney as the pompous British Foreign Office official who informs the arrogant Garrigan of his mistakes.<br /><br />The final scenes featuring mutilated cadavers and meat hook torture is not for the faint hearted. But the violence is structurally necessary and not at all gratuitous.</p></body></html>

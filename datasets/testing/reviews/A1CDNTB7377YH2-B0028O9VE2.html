<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies of 2004!"></head><body><p>This is one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in the past year!  It focuses on a single Mexican mother (Flor), who is trying to raise her daughter by working two jobs.  When she realizes that she needs to spend more time with her daughter, she talks to a friend about helping her find a job that pays at least the combined salary of her two jobs.<br /><br />The friend takes her to the home of a wealthy couple to be a housekeeper/nanny.  This is a major change for her because since she came to the US, she has not ventured outside the LA Mexican barrio.  On top of that Flor speaks zero English and the family for whom she will work for speaks no Spanish.<br /><br />Flor also learns fast that the wealthy mother is a control freak and her restaurant owner/master chef husband (Adam Sandler) is a wimp.  The daughter is a sweet girl but badly treated by her mother because she is overweight and not "perfect" in her studies.  Flor develops a bond with the daughter and when Flor is forced to bring her own daughter to live with the family, Flor bonds with Sandler because they both have very strong ties to their daughters.<br /><br />This movie seemed to be a tear-jerker for most of the female patrons that I saw at the theater and was a very enjoyable, fun movie for all the males.  The actress who plays Flor's daughter looks like a comer, who will be a big star someday!</p></body></html>

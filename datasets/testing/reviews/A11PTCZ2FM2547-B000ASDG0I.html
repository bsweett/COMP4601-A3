<meta name="summary" content="How Do I Love Thee?  Let Me Count the Bulletholes. . ."></head><body><p>Ah, true Love.  Dinner by candlelight.  Holding hands in the moonlight.  Snapping a new clip on your Glock while your significant other sprays you with semi-automatic love missiles.<br /><br />I appreciate a dark comedy as much as the next curmudgeon, yet MR. & MRS. SMITH annoys more than it entertains.  True, there is a predictable plot about a beautiful couple stuck in a rut--a couple who, unbeknownst to one another, are professional assassins (just try to stop that suspension of disbelief train).  Add to that the erotic chemistry between Brad and Angelina; my eyebrows are still singed after watching them.  But all the sexiness and over-the-top, lamebrained action fail to overcome the annoyance of Pitt's detached smirk and Jolie's constant flirtation with wackiness.  As the fighting (boy, is there fighting) escalates, I was suddenly asking myself, "Wouldn't it be great if they popped each other off?"<br /><br />Maybe in the sequel.<br /><br />While we're at it, would someone please feed Angelina a steak, mashed potatos. . .something?  Nothing wrong with being slim 'n trim, but come on, lose the East Africa look.  In the long run, MR. & MRS. SMITH's biggest problem was the fact Vince Vaughn didn't appear enough.  At least he gets paid to be annoying.<br /><br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Friends don't let friends not see A Christmas Story"></head><body><p>I recently found out that my mother had not seen A Christmas Story; in fact, she had never heard of it. Granted, we're Jewish, and we never watch TV, but I was still appalled. If somebody were to loudly exclaim 'Ith thtuck! Ith thtuck!', or try to sing a Christmas carol with a heavy Chinese accent, she wouldn't understand the reference! She thought my fanatic insistance that everyone on earth had seen the movie and loved it was a mild exaggeration - until we went to the store to rent the movie, and the clerk kept saying to her as he scanned the barcode: "C'mon you must have seen it on TV?--At least once?"<br /><br />So don't imagine your duty is finished once you've seen the movie and enjoyed it. There will not be peace on earth until everyone has experienced this masterpiece of Holiday cinema.</p></body></html>

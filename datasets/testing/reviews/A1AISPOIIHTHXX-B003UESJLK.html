<meta name="summary" content="Literally in my top 5 films ever"></head><body><p>When it comes down to everyone's favorite film, there's always a feeling that you tend to look towards cinema classic; films that are so universally acclaimed it seems automatic someone would just inherently call it the best movie ever even if you've never seen it or it just makes other movies lesser in comparison. However, a film like E.T is one of those kind where I can honestly say it's one of my favorite films even if it doesn't have the cinematic contributions of Citizen Kane, the epic splendor of Lawrence of Arabia or the sheer excitement of Star Wars. Instead you get a very touching family film that will appeal to everyone, unless you're some jaded person.<br /><br />Elliot (Henry Thomas) is a lonely kid with not a whole lot of friends, a split up family and is quite alienated. But near to his house, an alien being is left behind, stranding him on Earth. Elliot discovers him and with the help of Reeses' Pieces, adopts him into his family (sans mother's knowledge of course), names him "E.T" and has brother Michael and sister Gertie helping out. But there's others interested in E.T.'s presence on Earth and Elliot somehow has to get E.T back home even he wants him to stay.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg has always been accused of putting sentimentality where it's not needed, as if he's too afraid the film will be too dark so he has to put something that ties everything up. E.T. though manages to be touching without schmaltzy or pandering. In fact, the film can even be heartwarming in several scenes. One of my favorites is after Gertie first sees E.T and runs away, with E.T, arms up in the air, going after her like a crazed movie monster. Sure it's silly but I got to admit, I chuckled. I always like how it was shot: mainly from a kid's point of view so, besides Elliot's mom, every adult's top half is never seen or their face is obscured. The film is almost like a modern fairy tale and so while we can forgive E.T.'s ability to contact his people with a Speak and Spell while NASA can't do it with a 50 foot dish, it's still for kids and you almost don't even notice it anyway.<br /><br />Now I for one at least understand Spielberg's decision to do a bit of a redo of E.T's visuals, namely the character himself. Now he's more expressive and using more muscle features and movement but he looks, ironically, clunky. There's 2 noticeable problems right in the first scene alone: E.T hops rabbit-like instead of running in a straight line (a light on a track but still) which makes it almost more comical, then we have him running to a hill out of breath whereas in the original cut, he gazed solemnly and in one spot as his family takes off. Later on, his animation looks too noticeable against the more grainy/faded colors of the 1982 print, making him look more sharper than everything around him. But unlike long-time friend George Lucas who basically released the original Star Wars trilogy untouched because fans were mad the special editions were the only DVD version available, Spielberg at least knows some might prefer the old cut and some might want to watch the new one.<br /><br />For those of you getting mad that Spielberg ruined E.T, keep in mind the original is still on this set and the Limited Edition 2 disc one so while some don't like the new changes, it's not like we can't have the old E.T. back and since it's such a great movie in its own right, that's a great thing to have.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderfully Wierd"></head><body><p>You have to wonder how this one got by an industry that seems to release movies based on marketing surveys and the whatever the current political climate is.  For this is a movie unlike any other.  It takes big chances, and hits a home run, which gets it the five stars. <p>How to describe this movie without giving away too much plot is tough here.  Take a look at the box, and see the larger picture.  You see a big head with a door leading into it. First, guess who's head it is.  Next, notice that there are three people inside of it.  That should give you enough clues to pique your interest, without giving away too many details.  <p>But &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is not the only weird thing going on here.  John Cusack plays an unemployed puppeteer (yes, he plays with puppets) who is more or less pushed into an office job by his roommate Cameron Diaz in order to contribute just a wee bit to the finances of the relationship.  Once again I'll try not to give away too much, but a day's work here involves using an elevator in a very special way, walking funny all day, and being prepared to have your co-workers seen to not here a word you say are all part of it.  <p>It is in this environment that the title action takes place.  Then, believe it or not, it gets weirder.  We see the adventures of the three that take on the title action, in different combinations.  We then get a special treat at the title character also takes place, and how it's handled is very creative.  <p>Strangely enough, everything is explained, believe it or not very clearly, although just as wierd.  The last scenes are a bit confusing, but are open to a lot of creative interpretation.  Which is only fitting, as this is one very creative, very strange, very entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

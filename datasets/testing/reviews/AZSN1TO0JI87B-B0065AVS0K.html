There's nothing I can tell you right now, in this review, that you haven't heard before in other reviews. There's also nothing that can be put in print that will ever do justice to this movie. You just have to see it for yourself. "Sin City" is simply the most entertaining movie I have ever seen in theaters. No one talked during this movie, that's how engrossing and just plain cool it is.<br /><br />"Sin City," inspired by the graphic comics by Frank Miller (who shares directing credits alongside those "troublemakers" Robert Rodirguez and Quentin Tarantino) will likely be unlike anything you have ever seen. First off, the movie is gorgeous, shot in stark black and white, with color making a few choice cameo appearances. It's a very violent movie, very over the top. Not only are people shot in the crotch and beheaded rather liberally, but there are two, count 'em, two swirlies! And there's chunks in that soup, people! Talk about down and dirty! The violence reaches a certain point where it becomes surreal and almost comical (much like the "Evil Dead" movies) and helps push the movie as the ultimate fantasy that it is. The movie itself jumps around a lot in time (a trademark of Tarantino, you can see where he had his hands in this) and plays out through a variety of seemingly unrelated scenes, that don't appear to link together until the very end. The casting choices were also very interesting. More seasoned actors like Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan and Michael Madsen appear alongside unpredictable and riskier choices like Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl (I'll never look at him the same) and Alex Bledel (TV's "Gilmore Girls"). Surprisingly, everyone does a convincing job in their roles, even though they are all just support to the real stars: the sex and the violence. Be warned folks, this is not a movie for your children, or even the faint of heart, to see.<br /><br />"Sin City" is really the ultimate movie-going experience. After you walk away from it, you will find yourself chattering about it endlessly. It leaves a lasting impression, and is destined for mega-cult status. Truly a film you'll need to see over and over again to absorb everything. If over-the-top violence and nudity don't bother you, I promise you will enjoy yourself at this movie. Believe the hype, this is an incredible film.</p></body></html>

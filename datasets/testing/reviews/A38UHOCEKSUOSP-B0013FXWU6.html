<meta name="summary" content="An effective presentation of the explored subject"></head><body><p>This will not be everyone's cup of tea, and considering the subject matter, I did not think this film would be mine either but thanks to some creative work from the writers and director, and a perfected performance from Daniel Day-Lewis, There Will Be Blood was a pleasant joy ride of entertainment.<br /><br />The film begins with music one would expect to hear out of a horror film, while the director has us gazing across a desert on a sunny day, in the western U.S.  The music is erie and perhaps grants us immidiate forshadowing of what is to come throughout the film.  I did not realize it at first, but there is no spoken dialouge for the first 15 minutes of the film...I practically jumped when the first words came across, as the 15 minutes of spoken silence where quite effective, giving us an insiders look at the stages of extracting oil in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br /><br />Daniel Plainview's persistence pays off, as his oil business steadily grows and expands, while raising his young son in the early 20th century.  From the get-go, Daniel is not the nicest or most honest man around, and any gentlemenship he displays is out of business rather than kindness.  For awhile we only know the business side of Daniel, yet desire to know more, which eventually comes around but not until later on in the film.  The desire to understand this man more kept a certain suspense going.  Things are fairly calm throughout the first hour of the film, and you expect (even hope) for something to go wrong to make things interesting.  They do, certain tragedies strike and tensions build, primarily between Daniel and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), the leader of the local church.  The deeper meaning of the story begins to unfold, when we discover the villainous (in his own ways) Plainview and Sunday are more alike than different as would like to believe.<br /><br />Though the film has it's moments and messages that are interesting and make a point, it's the performance of Day-Lewis that is unforgettable and make this film sharp.  He brings all the right elements as a perfected actor should, allowing the role to come alive as if it were the very real thing.<br /><br />Acting - 5<br />Characters - 4<br />Drama - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></body></html>

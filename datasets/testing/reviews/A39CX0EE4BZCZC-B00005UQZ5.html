<meta name="summary" content="Fabulous Thriller That Endures"></head><body><p>This a one of the best thriller/suspense/action films I have ever watched, and I've seen tons of them for almost 50 years. It "endures" because it is just as entertaining on the sixth viewing as it is on the first.<br /><br />Of course it helped it was based on a TV show that people my age watched religiously every week, so the plot if familiar and many of us wanted to see how the movie would stack up to the TV program. Well, as good as the TV series was, this was far better. Two scenes alone: the train wreck and Harrison Ford taking a swan dive - were worth the price of the film. Great stuff.<br /><br />The story has been discussed by many so let me just add how much I appreciate the sound in this movie. When this film first came out on VHS, I used the opening moments as a demo model for various surround systems. The DVD has enhanced that as well as the picture.<br /><br />The film has just the right amount of action scenes, very interesting characters and a storyline complex enough to bring you back for multiple viewings to totally understand it. Ford, of course, is the star with Tommy Lee Jones a close second, but the more you watch this, the more you appreciate everyone's acting in this movie.<br /><br />And, by the way, filmmakers take note: here''s another example how you can make an "edgy" modern-day crime film without a ton of unnecessary f-words.</p></body></html>

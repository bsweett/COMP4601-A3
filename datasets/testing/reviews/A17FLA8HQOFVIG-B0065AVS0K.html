<meta name="summary" content="All about style and special effects.  But where was the story?"></head><body><p>The film is all about style.  It is a comic book brought to life.<br /><br />At first I was intrigued.  The characters are larger than life and the plot is about the hero trying to find the killer of a woman with whom he spent one romantic night.<br /><br />The film is shot in black and white and uses color to make its point.  Blood is always red.  And so is lipstick.  Eyes are green or blue.  And there really is a yellow bastard.  The acting is good too and the sets complement the film.<br /><br />However, Sin City lacked one important thing - a story I could get my teeth into.  The special effects and style overshadowed everything.  And I was left wondering what all this was about.  I watched this film for over an hour, hoping that it would make some sense.  Finally I fell asleep.<br /><br />Perhaps this film would be interesting to film students.  It certainly is a departure from the norm.  But I need more than experimental techniques to hold my interest.  I need a good story.</p></body></html>

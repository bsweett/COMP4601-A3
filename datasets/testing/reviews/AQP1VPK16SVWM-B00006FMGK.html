Every plot is a variation on these 36 dramatic situations. The Greek playwrites came up with all of them and honed them to perfection. What does this have to do with Star Trek Nemesis? Well a lot, actually. It isn't a remake of Wrath of Khan. Certainly there are some basic plot similarities but these are mostly superficial. Thematically the film has less to do with Trek 2 than with Trek 8. So if there are 36 dramatic situations (and everything, remember, is a variation on these)and there are 10 Trek films, what is the likelihood that there could be some plot similarities? A whole lot actually and Trek 10 in my humble opinion does it better in some areas and, yes, a bit worse than Trek 2 in others. It's not the worst of the Trek franchise that a lot of Trekkers claim but it's not the best either. For the worst of the Trek films featuring the Next Gen, I'd recommend avoiding Generations which was like an episode of the series (not a particularly brilliant one I might add but average)inflated into an epic film for the big screen.<br /><br />What does work in Nemesis works extremely well. Picard celebrates the end of an era with his crewmates as Troi and Riker get married. As if that wasn't enough change, Riker assumes command of another ship (the Titan)with Troi at his side. Commander Data finally moves up in rank (and does so without anyone dying)to second in command of the Enterprise. <p>After celebrating their wedding on Earth, Riker and Troi embark back to Troi's home world for a ceremony there aboard the Enterprise. En route to the planet Betazoid, the crew picks up a signal that could only be from a positronic brain like Data's. Intrigued, the crew go to this planet unsure of what they will find. It's pretty darn close to the Neutral Zone so Riker, still Picard's right hand man, suggests caution. They discover another of Data's long lost relatives in the process. <p>Meanwhile, Star Fleet has received a communication from the new Praetor of the Romulan Empire. They've requested a Star Fleet representative come to Romulus immediately. Since the Enterprise is the closest ship available, Picard and crew are sent there where there are a number of surprises awaiting them.<p>Contrary to a previous review, the acting is solid throughout and hangs in there with some of the best in the Next Gen film series. I'm rather surprised that the director Stuart Baird elected not to reintegrate any of the cut sequences for the film. They would have actually strengthened the narrative and explained a lot (for example, why Worf was on the Enterprise after being appointed to a position on Klingon. Turns out the diplomatic life wasn't for him. That line of dialog was lost during the cutting phase of the film). The cut sequences consisted of interesting character moments and revealed quite a bit about Picard, his feelings about meeting Shinzon the new Praetor of Romulus.<p>My suggestion--give Nemesis a chance. It's an entertaining film that has a number of marvelous battle sequences and some nicely nuanced acting from the Trek veterans. While the pacing is a bit sluggish at times, the overall pace of the film actually helps the film achieve some of its thematic gravity and momentum. I'd also suggest lightening up a bit here--it's a film in a franchise series that attempts to entertain while examining a number of interesting themes (whether our decisions create who we are or if we are just a victim of circumstance and formed by these very circumstances).<p>The visuals are top notch. I had my reservations about the digital visuals used in the film (actually it began as far back as First Contact where the Enterprise was a virtual Enterprise and not a model) but I've been proven wrong. They look impressive and there are visuals that couldn't have been accomplished with models and animation that are accomplished here.<p>After 72 episodes of the original series, over 100 episodes of the Next Generation, ten feature films (not to mention the spin-off series DS9, Voyager, Enterprise and all the novels spun off from the various series), sooner or later there was bound to be a dramatic situation that was repeated. It happened before (during Next Gen and the other series). I'm not quite sure what some fans were expecting but Nemesis is a fine (but far from perfect) addition to the Trek films.<p> Remember, next time you think you've seen that plot before, you probably have so be kind in your judgment. Nobody has had any success coming up with a 37th dramatic situation yet and until they do, we're stuck with those same 36 over and over and over again. Remember, it's not the situation but the telling that really matters. With Nemesis, Baird, writer Logan and the veteran Trek cast turn an eye to the difficulty of being closer to the end than beginning. Nemesis touches on a number of emotional issues that will eventually face all of us and does so with candor, wit and grace.</p></body></html>

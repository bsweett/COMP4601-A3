<meta name="summary" content="Set Up Camp With Alexander"></head><body><p>In the spirit of classics like "Spartacus," "The Ten Commandments," and "Mommie Dearest" comes this bio-pic that is miscast, overlong, poorly written, and visually dull for a three hour epic.  It made me appreciate "Troy" so much more.  Yet Oliver Stone still manages to get you hooked a little. There are three major mistakes with this movie.  Mistake number one:  Colin Farrell.  Pretty, yes, I give you that.  Can he act?  Well, no not really.  It was hard to tell sometimes with the ridiculous dialog they gave him.  Some spots are so funny I couldn't stand it.  He kept falling in and out of his Scottish tongue, it was distracting.  I wasn't seeing Alexander the Great, nor even Good, no wait, not even Alexander the So-So, I was seeing only Colin.  Mistake Number Two:  Casting Angelina Jolie as his mother!  She's only one year older than him.  She also suffers from staying to long at the "Camp" grounds with long speeches, overacting, and a flair for overdrama to say the least.  The storyline is pretty much the same as all bio-pics.  Overreaching ambition, secrets, making enemies, partying too hard will all bring you down.  As in most Oliver Stone pics there is a conspiracy or two, but not extreme.  Mistake Number Three;  The camera work.  Half the time I felt I was back watching "Cops," or "The Blair Witch Project" with all that jumpy, clumsy, and awkward camera work.  Mr. Stone is capable of much better work.  His action sequences are dull.  Nothing much reallt to see.  The locations used were nothing special either.<br /><br />Still, I think the film will work as a guilty pleasure.  Its the "Showgirls" of epic dramas.  What's that smell, do I smell a razzie award coming?</p></body></html>

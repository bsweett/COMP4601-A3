We want them all dead. "<br /><br />Steven Spielberg has directed and produced a grappling and intelligent thriller "based on true events".  A movie that is firm in its depiction and surreal in the flow from the real events of Munich in 1972 to the latter day events of the hunt for the "Black September" responsible for the murder of 11 Israelis. The movie is based on George Jones book "Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team" and the book was adapted to the screen by Eric Roth and Tony Kushner of "Forrest Gump" and Angels In America" team. The film is based on five Israeli agents who are recruited by Golda Meir (Prime Minister of Israel) and other top ranked Israeli government officials. Their job, if they decide to accept it, is to hunt down and kill the eleven Black September agents.<br /><br />The movie centers around these five former Mossad agents and the skill of the movie is the human motivation and their innate feelings of moral uncertainty in these killings.  Eric Bana who plays Avner, the leader of this group show us his uncertainty with the wavering of his voice and trembling of his hands as he forces his gun on one of the first Black September assassins. He leaves Israel, his family and unborn child to perform these duties and in the end becomes a hunted man. Daniel Craig plays the South African; Ciaran Hinds, (most recently seen as Julius Caesar in the HBO production of Rome) as Carl, the worrier who cleans up after the others; Hans, Hans Zischler, the German document forger; and the Belgian toy and bomb maker, Robert Mathieu Kassovitz. They move from country to country to hunt down their prey. This takes years and begins to wear on each of them.<br /><br />This movie was taken from a "true story" and the real story is as thrilling and devastating as the movie. Wikipedia gives us the facts as known:<br /><br />"It is known that Mossad agent Michael Harari led the creation and direction of the teams, known as the "Operation Wrath of God" although some may not have always been under government responsibility. Simon Reeve explains that the Mossad team consisted of group of fifteen people divided into five squads: 'Aleph," two trained killers; "Bet," two guards who would shadow the Alephs; "Heth," two agents who would establish cover for the rest of the team by renting hotel rooms, apartments, cars, and so on; "Ayin," comprising between six and eight agents who formed the backbone of the operation, shadowing targets and establishing an escape route for the Aleph and Bet squads; and "Qoph," two agents specializing in communications. (squad names are letters of the Hebrew alphabet)" Wikipedia.<br /><br />This line of work takes its toll on the five Israelis and in the end they are shot at and barely escape with their lives. This group is disbanded and we see Aver at home with his family in the US, being asked to return to the Mossad. A fitting message is the camera as it shows a shot of the New York City skyline, including the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. A message from Steven Spielberg to the world?<br /><br />This was a haunting film. So well filmed and brought to the screen. A message of the moral uncertainty of life and the lessons learned when revenge is a way of life.<br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-13-06</p></body></html>

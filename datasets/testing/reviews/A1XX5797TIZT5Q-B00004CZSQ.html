<meta name="summary" content="Peerless in horror imagery; hardly so in writing."></head><body><p>The way to enjoy Suspiria as a horror film is to put aside all consideration of logic and drama.  For above all else, Dario Argento is a weaver of visual palettes married to blatant scores, and in that area he  has no peer in the horror-film genre. Even if George A. Romero is an  infinitely better director of actors, editor and writer; even if John  Carpenter is subtler -- Argento surpasses them all in imagery, composition  and lighting, and Suspiria is his masterpiece in that regard.<p>Much has  been made of the film's use of outdated stock and wild colour schemes and  that still stands.  Suspiria is one of the few films willing to abandon  reality almost entirely.  There's no physical reason why this room is blue  and one spot by the bed is red...but why not?  Suspiria is a horror show,  and its merits lie not in the construct as a whole (the writing is very  shaky and the narrative even worse), but in key sequences of almost  delirious power.<p>It helps that Jessica Harper gives what may be the best  performance in an Argento film to date (Daria Nicolodi in Tenebrae and Asia  Argento in Trauma come close), saying little but expressing much with her  face and mannerisms.  The Goblin score proves the power of rhythms and  motifs within a film score (instead of the boring classical film scores  coupled with Carpenterian &quot;stingers&quot; in most '90s horror films)  and is entirely horrifying.  And the set pieces -- a room filled with  barbed wire; the famous maggot storm; the seeing-eye dog plaza sequence;  the incredibly vicious stabbing on the ceiling; the final destruction --  are breathtaking.<p>Get past the bad performances (Harper excluded) and  terrible writing (dialogue *and* plotting), and just absorb this film with  your senses.  Suspiria is a sensory experience, and on that department it  carries enormous power.</p></body></html>

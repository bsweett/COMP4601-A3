The special effects were tweaked to just the right point--extraordinary but not too far over the top--to inspire the right amount of awe in the audience.  'Reloaded' was in about the same vain, but the story dragged.  The third movie completely loses it.<p>I guess what bothered me the most about &quot;Reloaded&quot; is that the matrix itself really became secondary to everything else.  The movie is really about the defense of Zion from the Sentinels.  This brings up two discussions:  the matrix, and the battle of zion.<p>As for the Matrix scenes, I was left asking myself what was the point?  Trinity and Morpheus engage in a bizarre journey to rescue Neo from a limbo like train station used by programs to enter and leave the Matrix.  One battle scene had Morpheus and Trinity's enemies on the ceiling while they battled from the floor.  There was no apparent point to this, and it did nothing to liven up the scene.<p>The final battle between Neo and Smith also took place in the Matrix.  For the most part, it was unimpressive.  Unlike the battles in previous movies, this was too far over the top, and largely consisted of the two combatants landing punches that would knock the other a thousand feet away, and then they would charge each other again to repeat the sequence.  It didn't appear that any complicated coreography was needed.<p>While the work done to create the battle of Zion was impressive, the battle itself was not.  With all the action we have seen in the Matrix series, we know the creators are capable of making something much more exciting and tense.  However, the greatest part of the battle was the humans suited up in APU's, which are a knock off of the load lifters in Aliens, standing in one place, shooting at the endless stream of sentinels flying into Zion.  The only real excitement came when it was time for them to reload, and that was not exactly breath-taking.<p>The most redeeming part of this movie was the actor that impersonated Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith.  His impersonation was dead on to the point of being creepy.  It was the most impressive bit of acting in the entire series, followed up by Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Agent Smith.<p>While there are some things to think about (the meaning of love and emotions, religion, Neo as a Christ figure, etc.) I feel like the movie really changed the path established by the prior two movies.  There was a mystery surrounding the Matrix created in the first two movies, and it was largely blown off in the third.  If you plotted where things were going in the first two movies, you wouldn't conclude this is the logical result.  Sure, its a twist, but its way to forced.<p>Overall, the story was okay, the special effects were visually impressive, but not awe inspiring like those in the predecessor films.  I give it a three stars based on the quality of the cgi effects, the acting of the aforementioned actor, and leaving open the possibility of another movie that actually gets us back to the Matrix.</p></body></html>

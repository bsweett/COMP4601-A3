<meta name="summary" content="long superficial tale"></head><body><p>The Green Mile,' since it is based on a Stephen King novel, emerges as a death row prison story with a sci-fi twist. Chances are the viewer will either be swept up in this tale of life, death and spiritual renewal  involving a group of characters working and languishing in a 1930's prison  cell block - or dismiss it as a prime example of sentimental hooey. Like  the similar (and similarly overrated) Stephen King-inspired prison epic,  `The Shawshank Redemption,' this new film provides far too sanitary and  romanticized a vision of prison life to be either entirely convincing or  particularly meaningful. Indeed, `The Green Mile' goes a step further into  the realm of parable by ascribing to one of its main characters the power  of miraculous healing. Unfortunately, however, a parable is, almost by  definition, supposed to be short, pithy and to the point. The story here -  which runs a presumptuous 3 hours and 8 minutes - is so overstuffed with  subplots and subsidiary characters that it actually works to weaken the  emotional effect generated by the plight facing John Coffey, the innocent  messenger from God condemned to death, and Paul, the prison guard assigned  to run the death row cell block, who comes to learn of Coffey's  innocence.<p>`The Green Mile' certainly has its heart in the right place,  but it divides its world too evenly up into good guys and bad guys. Perhaps  the decision to cast Tom Hanks in the leading role of Paul accounts for the  fact that the character seems far too genial, soft-spoken and humanistic to  be a man dedicating his life to dispatching convicted murderers to their  just (or unjust) rewards. Coffey, a mountain of a man in the form of actor  Michael Clarke Duncan, ranks as the oldest clich&eacute; of all: an uneducated,  marginally imbecilic lug of a guy whose innocent, childlike heart and mind,  though trapped inside a behemoth's body, provide the clean vessel through  which God is able to work his wonders. Except for this last fact, Coffey's  pedigree descends from a whole multitude of earlier characters, including  Lennie in `Of Mice and Men' and even Frankenstein's monster. Is this  possibly why `The Green Mile,' in deference to the former character,  features a mouse in a prominent role? Similarly, one doubts it is mere  coincidence that the crime for which Coffey is convicted is that of raping  and murdering two little girls, an echo of Frankenstein - albeit, in this  case, Coffey, of course, is innocent; after all, having him be guilty of  the brutal murders would muddy up the moral waters and make it a lot harder  to elicit tears from a sentimental, happily rheumy-eyed audience. Also,  this allows the authors to pound home the Christ figure qualities of Coffey  (John Coffey - JC - get it?) to an unsubtle fare-thee-well. In addition to  dying innocently for another's sins, Coffey gets to heal the sick and smite  the evildoers (the latter, more in keeping with Jehovah perhaps than with  Christ per se).<p>Nor are the filmmakers much more successful with their  villains. Amidst all this amazing good will between condemned killers and  supportive prison guards, there has to be some vinegar to cut the  sweetness. This comes in the form of a too neatly balanced duo, one a  guard, the other a far-from-model prisoner. The guard, Percy, is a craven,  sadistic coward who delights in antagonizing the prisoners, taunting and  torturing the men at the moment of execution and, most monstrously of all  to the animal lovers in the audience, squashing a pet mouse on the eve of  its owner's death. The evil prisoner, Wild Bill, provides a similar  two-dimensional quality to his wickedness, serving as a too-obvious foil  for the other pure-as-the-driven-snow condemned men. By so neatly divvying  up the characters into clearly delineated categories of good and evil, the  filmmakers rob their film of the moral complexity that might have lent it  some real meaning.<p>As to the film's rather startling and, initially  unexpected, flights into fantasy, they serve mostly to further soften the  edge of this already overly idealistic and mawkish story.<p>`The Green  Mile' is certainly not a `bad' film. It sports a number of excellent  performances, generates some moments of genuine emotional power and, though  languorous at times in its pacing, admirably refuses to hurtle ahead as it  patiently gathers the strands of its story together. As with a good long  novel, one approaches it with a sense of patience and goodwill. We want to  give it the benefit of our attention. Therefore, we regret even more that  the makers of the film too often settle for the easy path of cheap  emotionalism and simpleminded sentimentality. Those of us willing to  dedicate more than three precious hours to this particular cause deserve  better.</p></body></html>

It stars some very known Actors in it like, ben Stiller, Chris Rock, david Schwimmer & jada Pinkette Smith. This movie is about four spoiled animals, A Zebra, Lion, Hippo & A Gariffe, who have know idea what it is like in the wild. When Marty(The Zebra, Rock) wants to go to the wild because he is bored with the zoo life runs away the other three animals go looking for him. When they find him they end up getting Tranqulized and end up on a ship to africa. When Four penguins hijack the boat they are on they end up on an Island called Madagascar. can these Four Friends survive without thier papering. I hope so. The dvd also has a mini movie that stars the madagascar penguins. It's a little cute cartoon. this is a really Good movie. I also thought the animals they picked were fun. This is a really enjoyable movie.<br /><br />If you liked This Movie Check out The Madagascar Soundtrack.</p></body></html>

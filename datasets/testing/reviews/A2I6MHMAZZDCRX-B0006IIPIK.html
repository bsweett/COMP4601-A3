<meta name="summary" content="Looks Great.  Little Else Going For It."></head><body><p>Its 1939 New York, and reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) finds herself caught up in a giant robot attack on the city.  But that's only the beginning.  It's part of an evil plot by German scientist Totenkopf to take over the world.  Reluctantly joining forces with Joe Sullivan, a.k.a Sky Captain (Jude Law), she sets out to discover and foil his plan.<br /><br />I heard great things about this movie before I saw it, comparing it to Indiana Jones and raving about the effects.  I'll gladly concede the movie looked great.  Using almost nothing but real actors and CGI settings, the movie is amazing.  It looks like it was filmed in the 30's or 40's, and easily evokes that feel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, looks aren't enough for this movie.  The plot is not the exciting storyline I was looking for, but rather boring and at times very hard to follow.  And the characters were hardly sympathetic.  This came to a head for me at the climax.  The heroes were in danger, but I couldn't bring myself to care if they made it out alive or not.<br /><br />I appear to be in the minority in this movie, but it was not the fun escapist ride I had hoped for.  Rent it before you buy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The light, the light!"></head><body><p>"The Others" takes place on Jersey, one of the British islands in the English Channel which was occupied by the Germans in World War II. It's a scary movie with devastating secrets and a story reminiscent of Henry James's "Turn of the Screw", but this plot has more chills. Nicole Kidman, playing a widow, does a superb job of acting in this movie, and everyone involved is excellent. A creepy old mansion is constantly dark within; the drapes are always drawn because Kidman's young son and daughter are severely sensitive to sunlight.<br /> The photography and atmospherics are wonderfully done. The three servants who just show up at the door and whom Kidman hires foreshadow bad stuff to follow. Kidman is constantly locking and unlocking inside doors in the big house which lacks electricity and phones. The suspenseful isolation becomes a part of the gripping film with its ghosts and Gothic horrors. Kidman plays the cold, forbidding role of the mother who frightens her own children with her fears and her piousness.<br /> Isolate the principals, shut out the sun, bring in the fog, shake in some supernatural elements, and voil&aacute;, a fine movie.</p></body></html>

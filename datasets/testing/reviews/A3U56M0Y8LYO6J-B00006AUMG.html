Despite appearances, it's not a technically a horror film but rather an action film with horror elements.  Yet, whatever the genre this film falls in, there is no denying its entertainment value.  It makes the first "Blade" film - which itself was not bad - look silly in comparison and illustrates that this franchise is one of the more creative, witty, and stylistic franchises going today.  "Blade II" is not high art or the next candidate for a British Film Institute analysis, but it is a fun and bold viewing experience.  <p>Half-man, half-vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes) goes in search of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who is being held prisoner by the vampires.  After freeing his mentor, the two men return to Blade's dwelling where they are immediately confronted by other vampires.  However, these vampires do not want to kill Blade but rather want his help.  After sizing up the situation for themselves, Blade and Whistler reluctantly form an uneasy alliance with the bloodsuckers and go in search of The Repears who threaten both the human and vampire population.  <p>"Blade II" has its moments of strong violence and gore but they are not gratuitous and are sensible within the context of the film's story.  del Toro is smart enough to know that showcasing blood and gore just for the sake of doing so only generates cheap thrills so he has wisely avoided this approach to the material.  Thus, "Blade II" is a film with a dark tone that is more creepy than upsetting.  Helping to further differentiate this work from the average run-of-the-mill slasher film is the strong performances throughout.  Snipes and Kristofferson are great and  Ron Perlman and Leonor Varela ably complement them.  Sure, maybe Whistler shouldn't have been revived for the second film and yes, some of the CGI effects are pretty bad, but in the end the scorecard still comes out in favor of "Blade II" as its positive aspects handily outnumber its negative ones.  Long live the Daywalker!</p></body></html>

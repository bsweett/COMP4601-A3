Here the superhero is made more real (an ex fed who had his family shot up and is looking for revenge) rather than some supernatural forces at work. With that it is just a joe soap revenge thriller that fails to pack the punch for what it could have been.<br /><br />One reason for the average rating is that we where promised a violent film the kind of which Hollywood has not churned out in quite awhile. Scene stills of The Punisher with a blow-torch in hand looked like it was going to be the real deal. Just turns out he fakes the whole scene and 'pretends' to torture people. Truth be told it is just a heavy PG-13 movie, but nothing pushing the rating the producers said it would have. Also the action is extremely limited considering. You will be surprised by how little of it there is.<br /><br />The only gem that saves the film is Thomas Jane. He is a good actor and can stand up there with the likes of new generation action heros (Diesel and Damon) and for that we have no quarrels. Shame that they just didn't push this film to make it harder. It just ends up being a little soft and not exactly the kind of superhero that the comic books delivered on... not that we do not like a little deviation... it just doesn't work that well here.<br /><br />Saturday Night pop-corn fodder.</p></body></html>

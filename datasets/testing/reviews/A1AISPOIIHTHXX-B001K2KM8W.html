<meta name="summary" content="A fairy tale for the older generations"></head><body><p>Pan's Labyrinth in many ways is like the answer to the Chronicles of Narnia or Bridge to Terabithia. If you weren't fond of the kiddyness of those movies, a more adult fairy tale came your way in 2006 done by Guillermo Del Toro, director of Hellboy and Blade II. The problem with the latter 2 films was that they were alright films for what they were but they never really transcended the genre it was in. Hellboy was a well-made comic book film but it didn't reach the status that X-Men 2 or the 1978 Superman film got to that makes it a great film period, whether it was comic book or not. Pan's Labyrinth however is not only a worthy addition to the fantasy genre but it's one of the better films found within it.<br /><br />Set in Spain 1944, Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen is travelling the countryside to be with Captain Vidal, Carmen's new husband in the Spanish army. Vidal is certainly not the most sympathetic to say the least so Ofelia's fascination with stories and fairy tales useful. However she realizes in the woods outside the house lies an ancient cave and a magical faun who tells her she's Princess Moanna, princess of the underworld. But in order to prove her worth, she has to complete 3 tasks which are particularly dangerous and finds herself trapped between the violent real world and a magical fantasy world that may or may not exist.<br /><br />I should get something out of the way since people might have a misconception about the film. When I say this is a fairytale for the more adult set, I mean it. There's some violent, bloody acts (you should see what Vidal does with a beer bottle) and one particular unnerving scene involving a creature known as the Pale Man is evidence this is not for the youngsters. But in a way it's nice to have an film like this where the more harsh realities of life can co-exist with the more fantastic elements that are possibly out there. If there's one thing that can potentially turn people off is that the more fantasy elements are not that numerous with many scenes devoted to Vidal and his battle with fighters in the mountains. But it's also a healthy balance with one side not overpowering the other side and making it too cheesy or too serious.<br /><br />No fairytale would be complete without a main character to lead us through their journey and I can't imagine anyone better than Ivana Baquero who is very believable as Ofelia and is quite a performance beyond her age. And Sergi Lopez plays probably the nastiest, brutal character to come around in awhile. He's downright vicious and he's one character you wouldn't want to cross. There's also some good performances from Maribel Verdu and Ariadna Gil as Mercedes, the house's caretaker and Carmen respectively. Also special attention should be made for Doug Jones playing the faun Pan as well as the Pale Man (that eyes-in-palms dude in the the trailers) who always manages to pull off convincing performances under heavy makeup.<br /><br />The special features on Del Toro movies tend to be quite plentiful and this is no different. Disc 1 houses a director's prologue (essentially one of those "I hope you enjoy this movie" things lasting 30 seconds or so) as well as an excellent audio commentary Del Toro does solo. Disc 2 has the bulk of it with looks into the set designs and the looks of things to the music as well as a good Charlie Rose interview which features Del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron (director of the excellent Children of Men) and Alejandro Gonzales Innaritu (director of the average-except-for-the-Japanese-storyline Babel).<br /><br />Released the same day as this was the Fountain, which was one of those fantasy films that tried to hit you in different places yet came across feeling calculated and cold. Pan's Labyrinth on the other hand felt like a labor of love and for once, a passion that actually makes a good film in the end.</p></body></html>

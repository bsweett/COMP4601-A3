There was "Cry Freedom" and "A Dry White Season" that essentially treated the blacks as peripheral characters.  About the most honest was the gripping "Hotel Rwanda" with a superb Don Cheadle as a protagonist.  Director Edward Zwick here has managed what other filmmakers couldn't do.  He has fashioned a thrilling action film without compromising the polemics of the dire situation of some Africans.  It helps that this film sports a cast that includes the most dynamic actors of this generation, Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly.  There is an urgency to this film where the makers demand that attention be paid to the people who have suffered for so long but it is done in a subtle way.  To paraphrase another film, everybody should bear witness to the inconvenient truth on display here.</p></body></html>

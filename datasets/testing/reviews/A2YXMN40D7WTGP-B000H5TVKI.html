<meta name="summary" content="Clean version of a good movie."></head><body><p>John Rambo doesn't have much to say.  He's just a wanderer who entered a small town where they don't like Drifters much.  <p>In many movies Brian  Dennehy would be the typical badguy.  He would be sort of like the fascist  Donald Sutherland &quot;warden&quot; character in that Stallone prison film  &quot;Lock down&quot;.  But he's not.  In fact many people would probably  tell him that he's doing a good job, keeping the vagrants out in a  professional manner.<p>However, John Rambo is not the usual bum.  He has  flashbacks and can't tell the difference between Vietnamese Captains and  Chris Mulkey.  Sylvester Stallone has a great physical presense in this  movie.  You believe that he is a hardened Green Beret who can go through 10  cops without breaking a sweat.  And his &quot;escape&quot; is well handled  as well, with the magnificient West coast forests providing great  scenery.<p>The movie gets the message across that there are no good guys  and no bad guys, just victims.  John Rambo is a victim of the US Government  who trained him to be a killing machine then abandons him, leaving him with  nightmares and a body full of scars and signs of Agent Orange.  That and  the fact he can't get a job and his fellow American hates the &quot;Child  murderers&quot; of Vietnam.<p>And the police are victims as well, having to  capture/kill this unstable killing machine.  <p>The DVD is a clean copy and  it has a difficult job.  It has to high light the mistiness of the Oregon  forrest, as well as provide good contrast between the background and  foreground.  While other discs do a better job (ie. Last of the Mohicans),  this is a acceptable transfer.  The sound is good as well.  However it is  unfortunate that they left the last song to go to Sly's brother Frank.  He  stinks as a singer and actor...<p>Rating: C+</p></body></html>

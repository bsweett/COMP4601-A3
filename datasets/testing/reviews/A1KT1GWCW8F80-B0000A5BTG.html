<meta name="summary" content=""Armageddon" all over again"></head><body><p>Saw this movie in 1999 when it was called "Armageddon".<br /><br />This version is no better, though I knew it was a dog before I got it.<br /><br />Yeah, "suspend the disbelief" for the science - I get it. However, I have problems with the "real" part, too, which includes lightweight birds completely shattering car and store windows (they mostly just bounce off), the space shuttle improbably landing (haha) where it did, general vehicular physics (such as whiplash), and the fact that although the movie managed to spell "acquire" correctly, they could not spell "on its way" correctly (it's not "on it's way") in the cyber cafe scene at the end.<br /><br />I was able to recognize both of the famous actors, Hilary Swank and Alfre Woodard, because they were the only females. Who were the guys, again?<br /><br />The commentary is OK, but I haven't gotten to the "making of", a special effect "deconstruction", or deleted scenes yet. But, I will.<br /><br />My copy froze at the 57 minute mark, and required starting over, 2 scenes past the problem.<br /><br />It's a long one, so get the big popcorn.</p></body></html>

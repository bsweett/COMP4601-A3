<meta name="summary" content="TRAIN ON THE RUN"></head><body><p>UNSTOPPABLE is adrenaline-driven escapism at its best.  Cliches?  Yes, but in an expected way.  We watch this movie to see the train run away.  The subplots are the necessry "evil", but Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are appropriately likeable so we care about their personal crises/cliches.<br />Director Tony Scott keeps the action moving and the camera/stunt crew are professional.<br />It's entertaining and worth a look!</p></body></html>

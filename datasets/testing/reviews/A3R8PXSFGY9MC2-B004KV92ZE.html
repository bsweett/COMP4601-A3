<meta name="summary" content="Kung Fu Panda"></head><body><p>'Kung Fun Panda' is your basic fun, family computer animated movie. It has lots of silly jokes, cute characters and a simple, yet humorous storyline. It follows Po the panda as he gets trained to be the dragon warrior and how he is treated by the other kung fun pupils. There is a high 'star' voice-over list for this film, including Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan and they all do a great job bringing life to their various characters. It seems strange to ask Jackie Chan to do a voice over as he is a very physical actor and was barely used in this film, but it lends the film some martial arts kudos I guess. This is a good film for kids and is fun enough to keep parents interested as well. At just under 90 minutes it's not too long so kids will lose their attention or parents will get bored. It does what it sets out to do well, be a fun animated adventure, but there are better animated films out there and this has a great deal to live up to (hence the 3 stars). Worth a look, but not one to rush out to buy the first time you hear of it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Scariest Reality Show"></head><body><p>Zodiac begins on July 4, 1969.  The Zodiac Killer shoots two young lovers, slaying a woman but not the man. A month later, a letter written by the Zodiac Killer arrives at the San Francisco Chronicle.  Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) covers the story while the cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) struggles to decrypt the Zodiac's ciphers.<br /><br />The Zodiac Killer's murders take place throughout California, a fact that muddles the case further as the various police departments and sheriff offices struggle to work together. The investigators include San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), Vallejo detective Jack Mualanax (Elias Koteas), and Napa detective (Donal Logue).<br /><br />The Zodiac Killer's murders are particularly noteworthy because there was a constant discourse between the serial killer and the media.  The Zodiac Killer's threats included puzzles (his ciphers), creepy details about his murders (bloody bits of cloth), and finally threats against school buses full of children. In short, the Killer manipulates the media as deftly as Paris Hilton on a reality show.<br /><br />The movie skips ahead as the years go by and the case grows cold. Evidence gathering techniques are sorely outdated or questionably biased, detectives on the case move on, and everyone but Graysmith is determined to find the real killer.<br /><br />What's intriguing about Zodiac is how it manages to combine the fact-finding wonkiness of CSI with the thrilling suspense of Silence of the Lambs.  Fincher manages to balloon the Zodiac Killer into a pernicious boogeyman who is every potential suspect and behind every murder.  And that may literally be true: one theory is that the Zodiac Killer took credit for murders he didn't commit.  A roadside encounter between a woman with her infant child and a mysterious stranger is one of the scariest moments on film (for new parents like me, anyway).<br /><br />And it's all true.  In an era where Ed Gein's murders have been spun into the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the relevance and reality of Zodiac makes the movie even more frightening. Although the murders were never pinned on a particular person, Graysmith (also the author of the novel) makes a convincing case for Arthur Leigh Allen.<br /><br />Was it really Arthur?  We'll never know.  Zodiac isn't about wrapping up the film with an easy villain.  It's about the price of living in a media-saturated culture where, for three years, the scariest reality show took place not on our televisions but in handful of towns in northern California.</p></body></html>

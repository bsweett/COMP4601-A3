<meta name="summary" content=""You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?""></head><body><p>Havingly recently seen Christopher Nolan's spectacular "Batman Begins", I thought it was time to go back and re-visit Tim Burton's "Batman".<br /><br />Tim Burton has long been one of my very favorite directors.  With his taste for dark, humorous, wacky and often weird films, he was the perfect choice to direct "Batman".<br /><br />Michael Keaton plays Bruce Wayne, who - shhh - is actually Batman.  Keaton was an interesting choice for Wayne/Batman, and he gives a great performance.  Jack Nicholson is absolutely wonderful as The Joker - a perfect casting decision.  He also delivers the now-classic line, "You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?"  Kim Basinger is Vicki Vale, the lovely journalist whom both Bruce and The Joker fall in love with.<br /><br />The score is definitely one of the film's highlights.  It's by Burton favorite Danny Elfman, and was one of his earliest scores.  It truly is fantastic - "The Batman Theme" is everything it should be and more.  Elfman's music is flawless.<br /><br />Another terrific aspect of the film is the set design.  The film's sets are magnificent.  They perfectly capture the dark, Gothic city that is Gotham.<br /><br />All the aspects I've mentioned above work along with fine photography and a good script (by Sam Hamm) to make a really great movie.  One of the film's few flaws - though I think it's kind of neat - is the music by Prince.  Prince contributed numerous songs to the soundtrack, and it's the one thing which dates the movie.  I'd highly recommend this movie; die-hard Batman fans may not agree with the slight twisting of the Batman legend, but they should appreciate Tim Burton's interpretation of the tale.</p></body></html>

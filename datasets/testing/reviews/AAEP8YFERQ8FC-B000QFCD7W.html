<meta name="summary" content="Wild Hogs, Four of Them"></head><body><p>For what it was, I thought "Wild Hogs" was a pretty engaging film. Four middle-aged men who are looking to make up for lost time go west, towards the coast from Ohio on a motorbike trip, and get caught up among the wilds, the bikers, and the romance of New Mexico. Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy were all pretty entertaining. They interacted pretty well too. Worth a look, though it is a bit crude in places..</p></body></html>

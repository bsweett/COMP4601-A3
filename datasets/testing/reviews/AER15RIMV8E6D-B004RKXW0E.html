<meta name="summary" content="The Perfect Ending to the Trilogy!!!"></head><body><p>I grew up with the original Toy Story movies, and now that I'm older, they still hold a special place in my heart. The 11 years was definitely worth the wait. This was an epic, and a great way to end the final story. Andy is going to college, and hasn't played with his toys in years. He plans on taking Woody, but leaving Buzz, Jessie, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, the aliens, & Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head in the attic. When the toys are accidentally thrown in the trash, they decide to go to Sunnyside Daycare. They are greeted by Lots-o-Huggin' Bear, aka Lotso. When Woody escapes the daycare, he is found by Bonnie and taken to her house. When Woody learns of Lotso's past, he decides to go back, and help his friends break out and get back to Andy before he goes away. It becomes very emotional toward the end, that I cried. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend TOY STORY 3!!!</p></body></html>

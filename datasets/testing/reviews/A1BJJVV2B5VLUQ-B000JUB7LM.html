My wife, being the steadfast Clint Eastwood fan, pleaded for me to go with her. Girls boxing... I wondered (yawn). Okay, good reviews were hitting the newspapers at the time... so off we went. The movie starts out slowly. Establishing the characters is a must... and Eastwood knows his trade (this is his 25th directed and 57th acted). Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald - the skinny southern poor waitress with a dream and what turns out to be a wicked punch. Eastwood plays the gym owner and trainer, Frankie Dunn. Morgan Freeman plays Dunn's right hand man in the gym, Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris, as well as narrator of the story. The story starts off with Maggie wandering into the gym, trying to work out, looking to be trained. Dunn tells her to get lost (repeatedly "I don't train girls", and that an over-the-hill woman shouldn't be starting a boxing career so late in her life). Persistance pays off for Maggie as Dunn is soon training her. The boxing sequences look real and are action-packed. Swank takes many a punch as does her stunt double. Boxer Lucia Rijker ("Blue Bear" in this film) was Swank's trainer during the process. "Million Dollar Baby" simply draws you in to the story from the start. The likable characters make you empathize for them every inch of the way. Most importantly, each of the three main character's performances are believeable. Wonderful highs and unexpected sad lows. One of my favorites in 2004. Worthy of 4 of the big time Oscars (Best Picture, Director/Eastwood, Best Actress/Swank, Best Support/Freeman). A 2-disc set; feature is 132 minutes; 5.1 Dolby digital sound; 3 better than average featurettes (1. Behind the scenes, 2. "Born to fight" with boxer Lucia Rijker, 3. James Lipton goes toe to toe with Eastwood/Swank/Freeman). If the movie "Boys Don't Cry" (1999) didn't make Hilary Swank a household name, in 2005 "Million Dollar Baby" surely will. This movie needs to be in your collection (5 stars).</p></body></html>

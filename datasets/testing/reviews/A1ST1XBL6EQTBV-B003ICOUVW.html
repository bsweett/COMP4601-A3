One of the mythical lycans...<br />dreaded creatures of the night.<br />They used alot of the old period story, but embellishments were<br />made here and there of course to update things slightly technology-wise,<br />while keeping that dark murky 19th Century British vibe intact.<br />Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Tolbert's father, who, as the film progresses,<br />reveals a few secrets of his own.  (-:<br />Visually, I found this movie entertaining enough...there's plenty of gore,<br />blood, disemboweled entrails, ripped out throats and ripped off heads!<br />But overall there was just something missing.....as in REAL PASSION in<br />the story-telling, acting, directing, editing. I watched the unrated director's<br />cut, which I assume is the director's unedited vision without interference<br />from the studio brass. But I'm afraid I wasn't terribly impressed!<br />IMO, this movie was another case of a good cast, good crew, otherwise good<br />producer and director, who somewhere got lost in the sauce and the film got<br />muddled in places. Other places are bursts of brilliance of what this film could've been.<br />Emily Blunt's character provides the softness and motherlove to the tragic<br />Laurence Talbot, and alas, is the one who delivers him from his<br />torment in the end. I must say the best scenes were towards the end<br />between Del Toro and Hopkins! Also, the scenes earlier in the gypsy camp<br />as well as in the asylum...KILLER!! (-:<br />My final advice would be to rent it first, and then if it's your<br />cup of tea, by all means, buy it!<br />It's not as bad as some try to make it out to be....<br />but it's merely okay at the  end of the day.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Cinematic Masterpiece and an Excellent DVD"></head><body><p>I love Casablanca and is one of my all-time favorites. While many may label it as a romantic film, I think is something much more than that. Aside from the great performances of Bogart, Bergman, Henried, Reins and all the others, the film has a certain appeal that does not feel dated and makes you want to see it again and again.<br />It's one of those films that must be in any collection because it belongs to that rare class of films that can be called Masterpieces.<br /><br />I've been wanting to buy Casablanca on DVD (I don't have a Blu-Ray player) but the ultimate collector's edition was very expensive as was the 2003 2-disc DVD (which is repackaged in the UCE with a documentary about Jack Warner). Then, Warner reissue that DVD in a  cheaper box and just cost $9,99!!! It was a bargain for a great film. This 2009 DVD is the same as the 2003. The picture is crisp, clear and perfect. No artifacts and only some minor (really minor) grain in some scenes. The audio is crisp without background noises. The extras are excellent with audiocomentaries, documentaries, and more. A must own edition for a must own film.<br /><br />If you don't own Casablanca yet, right now is the best time. This 2009 edition is perfect and really cheap. Buy it now and you'll always have Paris.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Trashy fun in deep space..."></head><body><p>Paul Verhoeven has a real cult following.  Most trashy directors do.  I mean, looking at his filmography, it's hard to find a `great' film in the bunch and yet many celebrated cinephiles count films like `Basic Instinct' and `Showgirls' as two of the best films ever made.  I'm assuming they follow this logic up with the whole `so bad it's good' argument, but honestly I can't rally behind this.<br /><br />Of all the Verhoeven films I've seen, `Starship Troopers' is easily the best.<br /><br />Having read Robert Heinlein's novel while still in school, I can say that Verhoeven's adaptation isn't especially faithful, but he does pull some of the more blatant themes and uses them to propel forward the action in a way that pulls your eyes into focus.  In like Verhoeven fashion, `Starship Troopers' is at many times exploitive and does seem to have an occupancy with flesh and sexuality, and the soap operatic relationship circles does have an eye-rolling effect on viewers who are looking for a more focused action epic, but `Starship Troopers' does get a lot of things right.  The action in particular is stunning.  This is a bloody bath of alien warfare, and those bug creatures are grandiose and grotesque and totally hit every mark, and the gore factor is a huge plus for a film of this nature.<br /><br />The `hidden agenda' here is a nice touch because it adds weight to some of the more ridiculous aspects of the film.  This is essentially a satire pointed at governmental control in the guise of a mindless sci-fi epic and it does manage to make that point rather effectively, but to use that as an excuse for some of the more glaring issues the film has (the acting, the clich&eacute;s, the wasted development) is kind of lazy.  There are many `smart' satires that straddle that fine line and actually balance out the exploitive with genuine wit, and `Starship Troopers' doesn't quite get that.<br /><br />It is a fun film, sure, but it is also an easy film to criticize because it seems to relish in its own inadequacies.</p></body></html>

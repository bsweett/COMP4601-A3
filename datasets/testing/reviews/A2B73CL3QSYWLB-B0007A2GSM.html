When I saw "The Incredibles" in the theatre I was blown away by the films striking visuals which I thought even surpassed their amazing work in "Finding Nemo".  What intrigued me in a second viewing of the film was the calibre of the writing.  Why I was looking for this aspect was that it was nominated for an Academy award for it's writing.  I can say with all certainty that this film is rich in texture, deep characterization, and magnificent storytelling.  Visuals are nice but if you don't have a good story to go with them, so what.  Director-writer Brad Bird successfully marries these two elements.  The film is more than deserving of the Oscar it received for best animated feature.  Inarguably it was one of the better films of 2004.  The Academy created the animated feature category so that high quality animated films did not have to compete with live action films.  If that category hadn't been created "The Incredibles" would have been very competitive with it's live action counterparts.</p></body></html>

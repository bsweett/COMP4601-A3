<meta name="summary" content="Terrific Satire!"></head><body><p>Let me be upfront, I loved this film!  It's original, quirky and funny.  An unusual mix in today's Hollywood.<br /><br />The essence of the film is the story of Nick Naylor played by Aaron Eckhart.  He is a lobbyist for big tobacco.  Typically, such a person is to be reviled.  We all know that smoking is not good for your health.  So, how can anyone defend the indefensible?  Well, Nick does it with humour and he does a good job of it.  Nick is a man of great charisma notwithstanding the fact that his bosses are deemed by many to be the devil incarnate.<br /><br />If this film has a message it is that tolerance still has a place in our society.  All too often, individuals and groups think it is there right to impose their values on others.  Think not just tobacco, but anti-alcohol lobbyists, Christian vigilantes and environmentalists.  The list is almost endless.  These people think they know what is good for you even if you apparently don't.  To question these zealots is to leave oneself open to attack.  Only they know what is good for you and society.  There opinion matters.  Your opinion is of no value.<br /><br />"Thank You for Smoking" is not an excuse for smoking.  Rather it is a black comedy about those who strive to make decisions for you.  The plot is quick paced and the acting is wonderful.  Eckhart is supported by Maria Bello as a liquor industry lobbyist and David Koechner as spokesman for the firearms industry.  Together they are "merchants of death".  They are also a very clever trio that works well as a unit.<br /><br />I'm sure the self-righteous amongst us will condemn this film.  Too bad!  Life entails risks that we can determine for ourselves.  This film is a breath of fresh air!</p></body></html>

Not only did Rodriguez craft a truly entertaining little Mexsploitation film but he had "something to say" as well by effectively portraying the ugly anti-immigrant sentiments, as he sees them, currently being encouraged by politicians in places like Texas and Arizona. I'll be damned if Senator John McLaughlin wasn't a shot at Senator John McCain but I could be wrong again. This isn't just exploitation, in my opinion it has a powerful message and that's not something you're going to hear everyday in regards to a film in which a naked girl extracts a cellphone from her vagina!<br /><br />The acting was all well above average, Chingon's score was ultra funky and the ironic role played by Lohan kicked this whole thing up a notch. Did it get better? The feminine play on Che, Frigga's one-eye, a luchadore hitman, the wink to Garko's Sartana and even the avenging nun of Ferrara's Ms. 45, oh yeah, all fantastico! Machete is a love letter to exploitation and trash fans and it makes no apologies for its offensive absurdity, nor should you. I really enjoyed this flick and I'll definitely be adding it to my personal collection.</p></body></html>

There was some resemblance, but not all that much.<br /><br />When Helen was taken from Sparta, it was supposed to be when Menelaus was away at a funeral, but not in this movie.  The war lasted for 10 years, and it was compressed in the movie to weeks, or maybe a couple of months.  That is some difference from Homer's depiction of it.  Paris was supposed to be killed at Troy and Helen didn't escape.  Also, Menelaus was not killed at Troy, and neither was Agamemnon.  In Homer Menelaus got Helen back and returned home, and Agamemnon returned home also, but brought Priam's daughter Cassandra with him and was killed, at home, in his bathtub, by his wife and her lover.<br /><br />I have to wonder why a more faithful story was not made.  The original is exciting enough, with no need for the dramatic excesses invented for this movie.<br /><br />The Iliad is not all that long a book and would be more worthwhile, more entertaining, and more rewarding than watching this nonsensical movie.</p></body></html>

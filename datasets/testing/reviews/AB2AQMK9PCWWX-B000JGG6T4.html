It's also far more entertaining to watch a flawed man seek redemption than a superhero flex his perfection anyway. Anyone who sleeps with a fifth of Jacky Dee,  a St James Version of the Holy Bible and a pistol I would say is flawed and when Denzel as Creasy gets to 'do what he does best' is when the movie truly sets 'on fire'. I could do without the herky-jerky hand held feel of the camera and the super-eight style of the edits (which are cool in No Doubt videos, but after a while become irritating in full feature films). Mickey Rourke and Dakota are used too little here: but both serve the film quite well. One thing's for sure--the viewer will never look at suppositories quite the same.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A welcome and pleasant surprise!"></head><body><p>I've never been a fan of movies like "Big" or "Freaky Friday"; where you have children living in adult bodies and vice versa. I also try to steer clear of "chick flicks" as often as possible.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when watching "13 Going on 30", which is an absolutely irresistible feel good movie with great performances, a well written script, and some excellent direction.<br /><br />12 year old Jenna Rink (Christa B. Allen) just wants to be popular. I mean... what teenage girl doesn't?? However, she hasn't quite made her mark yet; but that is hopefully about to change. Her 13th birthday is coming up and she's invited the most popular click in school "The Six Chicks" to her party. Of course, none of the sought after Six Chicks (lead by snooty blonde Lucy: aka "Tom Tom") really want to go, until Jenna promises them that she will write their upcoming paper that is due in class. Jenna does have one lifelong friend in next door neighbor Matt (Sean Marquette), who harbors a secret crush on the young Jenna.<br /><br />The day of Jenna's 13th party has arrived, and the basement downstairs is all set up in innocent teenage party fashion. Matt arrives with a hand built dollhouse (complete with wishing dust) for Jenna. Then the "Six Chicks" show up, along with the most popular boys in school; and our Jenna is on Cloud 9... briefly.<br /><br />In typical childhood game fashion and at Tom Tom's suggestion, Jenna is blindfolded and lead to the closet, where she awaits a secret kiss from the boy at school she has a crush on.<br /><br />Well the whole thing goes terribly wrong, sending Jenna in a tailspin where she eventually wakes up 17 years later in her New York apartment.<br /><br />Hilarity and romance ensue for the remainder of the picture.<br /><br />Jenna soon realizes that she eventually became the leader of the "Six Chicks", that she still works with Tom Tom as an editor for her favorite fashion magazine. She also comes to find out that she essentially got everything she wanted as a young teenager. In the process, she learns that as an adult, she has turned into quite the "BIT*H", and has alienated everyone around her; including Matt for several years, her parents, and her fellow co-workers.<br /><br />It's all about rediscovering yourself as an adult with childlike eyes, as Jenna gradually finds out what she has become, and then does everything she can to change into the person she now feels she is inside. All the performances are great in this movie; from the young Jenna, Matt, and Tom Tom: to the now older versions of Jenna (Jennifer Gardner), Matt (Mark Ruffalo), and Tom Tom (Judy Greer).<br /><br />Jennifer Gardner is absolutely irresitable, charming, comedic and loveable as Jenna Rink. If your not a fan of hers, you more than likely will be after this movie.<br /><br />This is simply a great feel good movie, worthy of more than just one viewing. However you would categorize a film like this (i.e. "chick flick", romantic comedy) one thing is certain: "13 going on 30" is sure to wrap you around its finger.</p></body></html>

I'm sure that other people, who have seen the trailer and heard the hype, may be left thinking just that-- This is it? That's all? Come on, give me a little bit more! Despite it's shortcomings, The Forgotten is a passable thriller that will at least keep you guessing, even if you don't feel like guessing any more.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is Telly. She's grieving for the death of her 9 year old son, killed in a plane crash. She's seeing a therapist (Gary Sinise) who tries to help her cope and her husband (Anthony Edwards) is understanding. Everyday she goes to her son's dresser and looks at photos and holds his baseball glove. One day at the dresser, the photos are gone. It's like her son has been erased. Her therapist tells her that she never had a son; she miscarried and imagined a life with a son. She doesn't buy this theory at all, confident that there is a conspiracy. Ash (Dominic West) is also a grieving parent (his daughter died in the same plane crash). But suddenly one day, he doesn't remember his own daughter, until Telly rips the wallpaper off in one room, revealing that it was in fact his daughter's room. The two spend the rest of the film together, running from people who keep chasing them for reasons we don't know and trying to figure out what the heck happened to their children and their own memories.<br /><br />It is a bit clunky. The overall premise is exciting. What would you do if one day someone told you that you never had a child? Or husband? Or wife? But the payoff in the end is, I feel, a cop-out. Short of giving the end away, I'll just say that it's very X-Files-ish. So if you like that show, you'll probably like this movie. It does bend your mind and about 60 minutes in, you'll be rubbing your head wondering what in the world is going on. Julianne Moore and Dominic West are great together, stopping to be sad just when they've stopped being chased.<br /><br />Check this out sometime, it's an interesting ride. RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The spirit of adventure"></head><body><p>I was surprised to find that this film goes beyond animation in its design execution and even its visuals.<br /><br />We see Carl Frederickson (voice of Edward Asner) spending his life planning a great adventure. His boyhood girlfriend Ellie shares his dream, they grow old together, and many local adventures drain the big adventure funds of money and time. Soon Carl finds he is alone in an alien world and makes an effort to fulfill his and his late wife's dream.<br /><br />The story gets a little more complicated as he finds an unexpected stowaway and new friends. Soon he is forced to realize what is important in life and finds that he has already fulfilled, Ellie's new adventures by living  a lifetime together.<br /><br />There is so much depth of thought and dimension of story that you could forget it is animated.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version and there are more than enough extras and adjustments you can make. Luckily, you can ignore all this extra stuff and just play the movie if you like<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00273D47O">99 Luftballons</a></p></body></html>

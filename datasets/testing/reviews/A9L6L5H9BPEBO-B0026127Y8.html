<meta name="summary" content="Take Some Time for Taken"></head><body><p>Liam Neeson is a government retiree who has devoted his life to his work. His ex-wife has since devoted herself to a new husband, and now Neeson attempts to reconnect to his teenage daughter. We get a glimpse of his prior life when former colleagues coax him into a security detail for protecting a pop star. With cat-like reflexes and skill he quickly dispatches an attacker and gets his star to safety.<br /><br />Cynical about the world he worked in, Neeson is pressured by his daughter and ex to allow the girl to take a chaperone-free trip to the City of Lights. He is torn between his fear for his daughter's safety and losing a relationship with her by saying no.<br /><br />The trip soon turns ugly when her daughter sees her friend being abducted from another room. She knows she is next and quickly calls her father on the cell phone he gave her. When the abductors find her she leaves the cell phone on and it is picked up by the abductor. The father offers a carrot and a stick. If they leave his daughter alone, he will forget their crime, otherwise he will find them and kill them. The abductor is foolish enough to say, "good luck!" before he hangs up.<br /><br />When he arrives in Paris, the action really begins and there is a spike in metropolitan crime with what he does and what he learns.  A father is out to rescue his daughter and there is no time to spare. It leaves him no room for subtlety or diplomatic courtesies. The dialogue is intelligent and fast-paced, and Neeson is always convincing in whatever role he plays. In fact, you even forget the others except for the French inspector.<br /><br />If you like to see death by Kleenex, where one person dies slowly over the course of the script, this is probably not your cup of tea. "La Chocolat" it is not. However, if you like to see a lot of strangers die violently throughout the movie than hold on to your black belt, because this is right up your alley.<br /><br />"Taken" should be borrowed or bought and watched. I've even watched it twice.<br /><br />Take some time for "Taken."</p></body></html>

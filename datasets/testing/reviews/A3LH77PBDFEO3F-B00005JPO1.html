Harrison Ford still has the goods. The movie is a fun action film with lots of fun stunts.<br /><br /> On the down side, it is the same movie as "Raiders", and "The last Crusade", just substitute Communists for Nazis and you are good to go. The movie has no shortage of corny stunts.<br /><br />So here's the deal, depending on your mood or how you feel about the Indiana Jones series, you may find this movie a 5 star continuation, or a 3 star dilution of your favorite action series. Either way you will have some fun, so enjoy!</p></body></html>

It's a spoof of professional sports with some solid actors (Vince Vaughn and Ben stiller, for example) and instead of focusing on an actual professional sport, they focus on dodgeball. I'm sure most if not all of us have played dodgeball as children and can remember how much fun we had, so this movie is bound to bring back memories (as well as spoofing the game) Overall enjoyable and funny movie.</p></body></html>

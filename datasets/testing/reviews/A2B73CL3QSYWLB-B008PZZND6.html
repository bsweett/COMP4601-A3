Anybody reluctant to see this film can relax because it's not going to change your inclinations.  Is this a great film?  That's debatable but it is a very good one.  I was impressed with a few things about this film primarily the direction by Ang Lee.  He allows the story to develope deliberately.  He doesn't shy away from the provocative nature of Ennis and Jack's relationship but it is told with discretion and taste.  Another thing that impressed me was the towering performance by Heath Ledger as Ennis.  Ennis is a taciturn man who does not verbalize his emotions but allows them to burn inside.  This kind of role in the wrong hands could come off as one note but Ledger pulls it off brilliantly.  Jake Gyllenhall is fine as Jack but his performance pales in comparison to Ledger's.  Great supporting work is offered here by Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and Randy Quaid.  Another bonus is the splendid cinematography and the touching score.</p></body></html>

Based on the classic television show, this is an absolutely hilarious movie! Snoop Dogg and vince Vaughn costar in which Starsky and Hutch try to stop a drug dealer. Will Ferell is in the funniest scene with "two dragons". After that scene, you'll be on the floor laughing. The accent that Starsky adopts at the end is funny (just do it), and the horse scene along with the chinese kid that throws knives are also funny. There are so many more funny scenes, like when Starksy takes drugs by accident. Believe me, it's really funny and is worth watching!</p></body></html>

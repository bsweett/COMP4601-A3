It's a fun story with good performances and spectacular effects.<br />As someone with a life-long interest in special effects and animation, I especially liked the Kraken, a giant sea monster that reminded me of Ray Harryhausen movies - but it's so good you can't tell which parts are CG. Most impressive, I am told Davy Jones is entirely CG - there's no actor involved - and the same is true of his entire crew save one, Bootstrap Bill.  No doubt this one will get an Oscar for the special effects / animation.  Oh, and the human actors aren't too bad either.</p></body></html>

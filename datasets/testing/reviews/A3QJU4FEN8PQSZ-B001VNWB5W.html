And now, the complaints.<br /><br />Some of the scenes lacked the impact of the graphic novel, strangely enough. The chief standout was the bar scene where Blake gets cut. The damage to his face has been greatly minimized, as though it were a mere scratch, and his words to Jon are devoid of emotional impact. This is the case for many scenes, where it seems the actors are rushing through their lines - a beat or two is sadly missing. This is evident, for example, when Daniel says, "What do you expect? The comedian is dead" (perhaps I paraphrase).<br /><br />There are some inspired shots, such as when we see Blake's tear navigating the rivulets of his face.<br /><br />The great Plot has been slightly changed, but to no great detriment. There are perhaps a few more left-wing jabs, but the thoughtful viewer will see that the entire constitutes a right-wing cautionary tale about "smarter" men making decisions for "the little people," and how far they are willing to go - to sacrifice (others) - to create a Utopia. There are also jabs at our coddling of evil. So there's plenty to be enjoyed (and frowned at) by viewers of almost all political leanings.<br /><br />The action that has been added all works for the good of the movie, although some of the violence is gratuitiously graphic, albeit in keeping with the graphic novel.<br /><br />All in all, an entertaining translation to screen. The sad thing is that many viewers will not ask the big question - is that the only way to bring about peace in a world of fallen beings? To create false crises, such as global cooling (in the 70's), then warming (80's to 90's? I dunno), then, when the earth started cooling in 2001 (search on "Climategate"), "climate change" instead? Perhaps this will be a wake-up call to search for the true meaning of man - the call to be something grander and nobler than the butt of a practical joke, rooted in the realization that our deepest longings are not just chemical illusions borne of atomic accidents, but are for something true and worthwhile that can only be found in Someone greater than ourselves.</p></body></html>

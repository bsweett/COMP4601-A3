At home, I don't have to deal with screaming kids, idiots who think it's the height of coolness to project their laser pointers on the screen or talkin' on their cell phones every five minutes, and schmendricks who think they're standing in for Joel/Mike and the `Bots from MST3K. With wonderful little distractions like this, is it any wonder I prefer to stay indoors to maximize my cinematic enjoyment?<br /><br />This, the first of the modern cinematic `Batman' outings, became a case in point. In a strange fit of masochistic insanity, I decided to catch a midnight matinee re-release of `Batman' at the local bijou. I was in luck for a while- people were behaving themselves. Then came the moment where Eckhardt, a cop on the take, gets shot down by Jack Napier (the guy who becomes the Joker).<br /><br />William Hootkins, the man who played the portly and corrupt cop, is also famous among pop-culture sci-fi aficionados as Porkins, the first X-wing pilot to get shot down during the climactic Death Star battle in `Star Wars'. Ironically, this character's last words were, "I'm all right, I'm all--Aaaaagggghhh!", which were the very words I heard a group of uber-Warsies yell out when he caught a bullet in `Batman'. You know, I like the `Star Wars' flicks as much as the next geekin' fanboy, but not to the point that I'll annoy other folks with my high-decibel verbatim recitations of an actor's lines from another movie. It's kinda gauche, you know?<br /><br />But, aside from that, I rather enjoy this little slice o' comic-book celluloid. Jack Nicholson's Joker is one of his most nutso performances ever! Actually, that's not saying too much, is it? I mean, you take a look at `The Shining', `The Witches of Eastwick', or `One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', and it's pretty obvious that Nicholson isn't exactly challenged by roles involving psychos and evil incarnate. Still, he makes the Joker over-the-top without going overboard, unlike the villains from the Joel Schumacher-directed Bat-flicks!<br /><br />I'll be one to admit that Michael Keaton doesn't exactly look the part as Bruce Wayne... which I learned was what director Tim Burton wanted (he states in one of the behind-the-scenes shows that he wanted the Bruce Wayne character to look like he HAD to dress up to be scary to criminals). But as Batman, it's a completely different story. Neither Val Kilmer nor George Clooney could ever hope to match that chin! Of course, if Jay Leno were to ever accept the role...<br /><br />Speakin' of special features: as I stated earlier, there's a big ol' freakin' butt-load of stuff to look through here. I started off with the feature-length commentary track by director Tim Burton-- which I stopped listening to about ten minutes in, `cuz I was zoning out to his incessant droning about... something or other. Okay, so the commentary track was a bust; no biggie. To be honest, I'm not all that thrilled by most DVD special features; after watching several zillion behind-the-scenes mini-docs and retrospectives, I've gotten more than a little jaded by it all. Still, for the sake of putting together as thorough a review as possible, I gotta make a few sacrifices...<br /><br />Anyhoo, there's a whole ton o' behind-the-scenes featurettes, retrospectives, and even a history of Batman in comic books featuring interviews by such comic book luminaries as Paul Dini, Alex Ross, Frank Miller, and Kevin Smith, as well as the late, great Batman creator Bob Kane. While I usually find most behind-the-scenes docs kinda dull, many of the shows on the bonus platter had some reasonably interesting moments. Especially entertaining were the movie's principals discussing how "iconic" and "archetypal" their respective roles were, and how the roles "related to their comic book counterparts." This whole love-fest got to be so nauseating that I almost "barfed."<br /><br />Also covered were looks at the special effects, as well as the building of the bat-suit and batmobile. Quite frankly, I found some of the effects in this particular go-`round a tad less than special, especially Joker's fall off the cathedral. But others worked out pretty well, albeit not totally perfect.<br /><br />Also covered are profiles on the film's main heroes and villains, with retrospective interviews by the principals who played the parts. They even did a profile on the Joker's trusty sidekick, Bob the Goon (as played by Tracy Walter)... who is my all-time fave bad-guy sidekick. Well, aside from General Disarray, faithful aide to the scourge of South Park Professor Chaos, that is.<br /><br />All in all, the 2-disc special edition release of the first Batman flick gives you about as thorough a look at the history, development, and making of the movie as you can get! `Course, if you're not into the extra stuff, the movie itself looks pretty danged good... a little better than the original DVD release, even!<br /><br />`Late!</p></body></html>

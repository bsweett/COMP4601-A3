The main character, Cusack, is a struggling puppeteer married to Diaz, a pet-obsessed woman with frizzy hair.  One day, Cusack takes a job as a filer in a bazaar firm that is on only half of a floor, and he discovers a portal into actor, John Malcovich's, brain.  All the while, Cusack has been obsessed with Catherine Keener's character, Maxine, and so has Cusack's wife, Diaz.  Things get confusing for everyone, Diaz thinks she's a transexual after being in Malcovich's head, Maxine is only inlove with Diaz while she is in Malcovich, and Cusack will do anything to win over Maxine including tying up his wife and leaving her in a monkey's cage.  Very weird idea for a film, definately not mainstream, but I really enjoyed it.  It's genius.</p></body></html>

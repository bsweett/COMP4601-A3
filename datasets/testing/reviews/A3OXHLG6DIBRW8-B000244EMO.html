<meta name="summary" content="Fun Action Sci-Fi - Recommended"></head><body><p>"Predator" is a guilty pleasure since there really isn't much in the way of great acting or deep hidden meaning, but there are a lot of things blowing up, a very cool alien, and some great hammy lines delivered by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and Jessy Ventura!<br /><br />No Spoilers from me: The plot is fairly straight forward, a special ops team gets dropped in the jungle to rescue the crew of a downed chopper and things just do not go as planned... The special effects are fairly good and hold up well enough.<br /><br />Again, not very deep but a lot of fun when you are just looking for an action sci-fi to watch.<br /><br />Recommended! Amazon tends to lump all of the reviews for movies, regardless of which of the various media formats (DVD, Blu-ray, Video On Demand, etc) you bought. This review is strictly for the Video On Demand download from Amazon (watched through my Roku HD-XR Player).<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

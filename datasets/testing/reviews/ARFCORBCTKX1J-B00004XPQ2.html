"The Bridge on the River Kwai" is not "about" British POWs building a bridge. It's about Other Things, for which the story (a near-total inversion of the historical facts) serves as a backdrop.<br /><br />Contrary to what one reviewer has written, there /are/ "better-looking" Blu-ray transfers from that era, most notably "The Searchers", which is of absolute demo quality. "Bridge" is excellent, but not at that elevated level.<br /><br />Color photographic materials of that era (and well-into the 70s) had high contrast -- that is, a limited tonal scale. This is most-apparent in outdoor scenes under direct sunlight. The effect is harsh, even garish, and the first 20 minutes or so of "Bridge" suffer badly from it. For whatever reason, this harshness gradually declines. On the other hand, scenes shot "indoors", under controlled lighting, do not suffer from this problem, as the direct and fill lighting can be fine-tuned to compensate for the film's limitations. (The same things could be said about many films of this era; "Bridge" is not unique.)<br /><br />Another problem is that -- despite what some review claim -- this is /not/ a true Technicolor film -- it's shot on an integral tripack material, probably supplied by Kodak. "Technicolor" of this era suffered from the inability to render vivid colors with their full saturation (unlike "real" three-strip Technicolor), and a color balance that leaned strongly towards the warm colors, sometimes with muddy or muted greens. In outdoor scenes, one often feels the only colors are blue, green, and brown. Indoor shots under artificial lighting do not generally have this problem -- there's a wider range of more-natural colors.<br /><br />These color deficiencies aren't helped by the fact that a few outdoor scenes have a sickly yellow-green cast. Perhaps the available sources had deteriorated to the point where a full correction wasn't possible, but I doubt it.<br /><br />There was only one point where I saw anything that even remotely resembled edge enhancement. And there appears to have been little or no grain reduction. THANK YOU, SONY, for not trying to "enhance" the image in ways that only degrade it.<br /><br />As wonderful as the restoration is -- and this /is/ a significantly better edition than any I've previously seen -- the restorers made no apparent effort to achieve a consistent color balance throughout the film, or to broaden the range of colors displayed -- in other words, to make it look more like a recent film, something that David Lean, et al, could not possibly object to. What you /will/ see is much-improved version of what I first saw 53 years ago, but nothing more.<br /><br />The sound is real stereo, as befits a prestige "event" film of that era. I can now hear subtleties in Malcom Arnold's Oscar-winning score I'd never noticed. For example, whenever Nicholson takes command and starts making decisions, the music seems to suggest he's loony.<br /><br />The film remains an absolute classic, one of those very rare films that encourages discussion of the moral and ethical issues it raises. An unconditional recommendation -- and don't reveal the surprise ending!</p></body></html>

I'm not sure why that is because at face value, it would seem that BLADE II is a totally unoriginal film, borrowing from the best of action-horror movies. However, the film works and works quite well.<p>BLADE II starts off not too long after the original movie ended. Two years have passed since Blade saved the world by ridding it of the young vampire who was threatening to destroy it.  Blade has spent that time killing vampires and searching out their lairs, seeking to find his weapons-manufacturer, mentor, and friend, Whistler. In BLADE, everyone assumed that Whistler was killed. However, we soon learn that wasn't quite the case. He tried to kill himself, but the vampires wouldn't let him. Instead, they turned him into one of their own and beat him as close to death as possible and then began the procedure all over. Blade succeeds in finding Whistler and injects a serum into him that will either turn him back into a human or kill him when the sun rises. The serum works and things seem back to normal.<p>However, things aren't quite normal. A new breed of vampire has risen that doesn't seek out human blood, but vampire blood. Also, unless a vampire is devoured, it turns into one of these new creatures, too. The creatures seem to be a cross between zombies and vampires, but stronger than either one. Silver and garlic have no effect upon them and only sunlight does any substantial damage. The vampire lord summons Blade seeking a truce. He wants Blade to help him hunt the creatures down. Blade agrees, only because it brings him farther into the vampire world than he has ever been before. And so, the chase begins.<p>The action was quite good in the film and though much of it is derivitive from the Matrix, those style of stunts work in the world where BLADE II takes place.  I was also impressed with how fleshed out the characters were. All of the major characters were fully developed in this movie and we see sides of Blade and Whistler that weren't even hinted at in the first film.<p>Overall, BLADE II is a fairly decent action picture that is far better than the original film in the series.</p></body></html>

Usually the original film is well-written and scary, but most Hollywood producers make sequels to make money with mediocre scripts and untalented actresses juggling their upper portions of their bodies to be discovered. However, the "Saw" series of films are all freightening, hair-raiing, fast paced, involving, and, blood-curdling. The plot is simple: a psychopath named Jigsaw kidnaps people who take their lives for granted and puts them in torture chambers to see who can escape. The "Saw" films are not for the faint of heart, so if you have a weakness for gore these are not for you to view. But, if you want good horror that will scare you out of your seat watch the "Saw" films. I can't say I have a particular version I like the best, for all the sequels are well produced and follow the same formula as the original. As of 2010 there have been six "Saw" films, usually being released to theatres the week before Halloween. The latest "Saw" film, unfortunately, was not as successful as its predecessors.</p></body></html>

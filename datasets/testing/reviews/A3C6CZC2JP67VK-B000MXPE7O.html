The 'Good Shepherd' always struck me symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, "The Good Shepherd" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot.<br /><br />This movie is told from Damon's point of view, its scope is epic, and covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace. Angelina Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she' get into character very well. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.<br /><br />Robert de Niro (got to love him), in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is the executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is a little tweaking.</p></body></html>

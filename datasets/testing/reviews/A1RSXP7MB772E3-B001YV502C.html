<meta name="summary" content="Science fiction hits us in 2007! Dystopian film noir an ambiguous message."></head><body><p>while watching, I sat and compared this film in the genre of mature science fiction. Blade runner comes to mind, as you've maybe come across a few reviews with it. I feel it bare's strong resemblance to the sleeper hit 12 monkeys, staring Bruce Willis as a confused convict with a gaping hole in his memory, which slowly rejuvenates through the coarse of the movie towards the climax, in which he discovers his own beginning. A sort of Time vortex for you science minded ones. The comparison comes from the anxiety ridden truth that there seems to be this world, which is perfectly sensible to the characters within, but to the viewers, is crypted and otherworldly. Though, both, lead you to believe there is a final answer, just in that mysterious, ambiguous, unsaid way. For Children of men it is hope, not the avoidably gargoned definitions that lie in the answers of a not-to-distant-future's civilization. For 12 monkeys it was the terrible agony of fatalism. But it seemed trapped within that boys eyes, eyeing his adult self, that there was the hope that perhaps one lifeline will produce the cure for a diseased and hopeless world. The same hope, resounds at the end with the idea of the human project.<br /><br />  Children of Men is outstandingly ambiguous in nearly all departments. It thrusts you into a mans life, whose past seems to slowly catch up with him. You are led to trust this man, as will the fertile carrier, whose harsh, direct way of communicating somehow becomes servile to. (Fatalistic?) It seemed almost out of character for her, after fumigating her disfavor for the man almost incessantly from her sudden arrival. She uncovers her meanness by unbosoming her 'boys' name, whom he disregards as a clownish attempt at a most serious matter, and to take a step back in the timeline of the movie to a further degree as she freely, and carelessly, 'unbosom's' herself again to show in true form the nature of their journey, her round, and very pregnant belly. (in fact nearly bursting as you will soon find out) The film is a respectable combination of artistic camera work, and twisting, gyrating tension in what feels like a short story of sorts. It is without expanations, but fullfilling in that way that pocket, novellas provide for subway riders, or those with ample and numerous moments alone. It's climax is gratuitously wartorn, and its escapism edges you to the borders of your seat, panting and sweating in the dark, mesmerized by the shockingly, numbingly good sequences until the poetic end. Filled with applaudable actors giving respectable due to a most determined director. I couldn't help but stand and feel a jerking strain at seeing the blank screen and trademark like post-title.</p></body></html>

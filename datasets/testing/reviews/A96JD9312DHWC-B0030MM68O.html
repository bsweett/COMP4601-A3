It shows you an aspect of war you hear a lot about but you do not see that much of - bombs that get left by the wayside and the people that have to deal with them. In it, you get to look at three people and see a lot of the motivation that pushes them forward (and a 4th character briefly - although you don't really get to know him that much). This introduces you to the adrinaline ride some people have, the fear that fuels some of the motions, and the respect that soldiers seemed to have for these people. That was something I liked about this the most - the respect portion, and the part that shows you just how much these people have to watch out for.<br /><br />When we start our ride we are introduced to some of the mechanics that are used in this type of war, and we also see what the bombmakers work with. A robot pulling a small cart versus a 9 volt battery hitched to artillery shells. That says a lot about the powers that are out there fighting, and the things they have at their disposal. It also says something when you see that both sides have an element in common - one that stands and that thinks and that tries to outwit the other - and you even see respect shown for each side. In one instance we see what a man that has disarmed 800 plus bombs keeps under his bed, and these things said a lot a well.<br />I really thought the movie was thought out quite a bit in the character side of the conflicts, not to mention the things we saw happening in the other portions of the fighting.<br /><br />There are moving parts in the movie as well - I really thought that some of it was horrible because of the way some of the bombing was set up. The bio-bomb that we see in the movie, for example, isn't just a person wearing a belt. There is a person wearing one in part of the movie but that is just a small part of the topic. The kid thing - that was something else.<br /><br />You might like this if you like movies about war seen from a different angle, although the conflict portion might not be what you expect. There are bombs, people hurt, and some interesting things exposed here. But the thing that really powers this is the human element, and the ways that different people survive (and perhaps thrive) in a conflict zone. I personally liked the movie because I had read oceans of headlines about roadside bombings and I had seen stockpiles of shells being destroyed in the sands, but I had never seen things from this angle.<br />If you expect killing on all sides you get snippets of that in some places but this is more of a mindgame being played out. Thrill ride? Yeah, i might even say that but not in the atypical sense.<br /><br />It is at least worth checking into.</p></body></html>

At one point in the extras, it is even stated that HELLBOY II is a sequel to PAN'S LABYRINTH, which is kind of odd, because I thought HELLBOY II was a sequel to the First HellBoy. A very extreme fan of Helboy told me that Hellboy II was more true to the HellBoy Series, and it was then that I thought, aha thats why it feels so different. Its not really moving on from the First film, its kind of doubling back and covering ground that maybe the creators thought they should cover in the first film.<br /><br />The characters are more fleshed out in Hellboy II, so in that respect, its more detailed, but I guess it was not what I was expecting, which I guess is good. Since I did enjoy it. And the groundwork is definitely laid for a HELLBOY III if that is ever touted. But in the meantime, this is a pretty good show. The Visuals are great, the audio is great... its a Great experience, however it IS very different to the first HELLBOY.<br />The Triple disc is worth it if you are willing to filter through some drivel. The Commentaries are good, however Del Toro makes it feel like a Film School commentary, but occasionally he does get entertaining, which is odd, because his Documentary material is mostly good. I say mostly good, but some of it on disc 2 is bordering on boring.The Commentary on disc one is mostly fun, but anything with Selma Blair is kind of nice to listen to, no matter what, but I guess I  have a bias. The rest of the DVD extras expand on the rather contradictory theme of the sometimes<br />good, sometimes boring theme, but nothing inbetween. Del Toro's work seems to specialise in polarising any fans.<br /><br />Regardless, the end product here is great, and to a large extent, seeing how Del Toro got that product is very Fascinating. Also, the Digital Copy goes great on the Classic 120 Gig Ipod, with Great Sound.<br />If you are lucky enough to get the Special Pack from BEST BUY, the Bonus Model and Documents are extremely cool... well worth another 40 bucks or so.</p></body></html>

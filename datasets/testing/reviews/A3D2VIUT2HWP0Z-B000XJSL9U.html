In this case, its more John McClane, More action than I could have thought possible, and they top themselves in so many ways in all the cool stunts.This is really a ride  and a half in the un-rated version.John is all analogue age action hero, and the "side-kick", is a very unlikely Black Hat Hacker, with an ultra Cool appearance by Kevin Smith, this all combines for a total blast.The Fight Sequences around the Elevator shaft and IN the shaft are very nail-biting. This is a must see in 5.1<br />The Commentary is just on the PG13 Version but explains a lot and adds a lot to the movie experience, a very nice extra.<br /><br />DVD Versions:<br />Careful what version you buy. It seems that the labelling on the first few US  batches has been messed up.The Single disc version clearly states that a Music Video and a Behind the Scenes is added, where-as the Double disc has this added feature on disc two. So, whats the story ? Hopefully someone will either sort the discs or proof the DVD covers. But, a minor<br />flaw.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shyamalan has lost his edge, definitely!"></head><body><p>We have been waiting for quite some time for Night Shyamalan's comeback with a movie that will reclaim his walk to fame.  I hate to say it, but it is starting to look as if this director's fame was purely accidental.<br /><br />Set in the northeast this film is about scary epidemic that starts in urban parks that spreads to New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  People become disoriented, and before long, they start committing suicide.  No one can escape the horror.<br /><br />Main characters are young married couple experiencing some marital tension caused by mutual indecision to have (or not to have) children.  Mark Wahlberg is simply wonderful in his portrayal of a "hapless, not too bright, but yet likable" character of a husband and a high school science teacher trying to preserve the life of his wife, their friend's daughter and his own.<br /><br />The idea of the film about plants disharging some sort of poisonous toxin in revenge for human's lack of care about the environment is bizzarre.  It's unexplained halt on epidemic is even more strange.  Note to director - next time, think through a story line first before shooting a movie.  It may just help a little itzy bitz.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good movie that really does continue to keep you guessing"></head><body><p>This is an interesting movie based around in london in 1900 when the age of magicians/magic show were taking of, of course culmonating with houdini in America.  A very interesting concept for the movie, and it really did keep me guessing.  I could write a long review like many of the other reviewers, but they do a good job at summerizing it. I can just say, Chritian Bale and Hugh Jackman do spectacular jobs at playing these roles and it was Cool Seeing David Bowie in a movie again, although I kept picturing him in that Darn Labarinth outfit as he played the role of Dr. Tesla. Well casted, great efects, and great plot. Check it out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's all about Meryl!  The film itself plods along. Review of Blu-ray"></head><body><p>Read all the reviews of this film (there are 127 here already on Amazon - focusing on the film as shown in theaters. ALL of them focus on Meryl Streep and here Oscar-winning performance. I have to agree that she is an amazing actress and really inhabits the character of Margaret Thatcher in this film. But the production as a whole seems to last for three hours when, in fact, it is only 105 minutes. The reason is the concept used by Director Phyllidia Lloyd that has the time frame jumping back and forth (AND back and forth, and...) between Thatcher in her final days and at various points in her career. There is the conceit that has her late husband (and childhood sweetheart) Denis, appearing in her mind (and on screen) to converse with her, long after he has died. Personally I was getting a headache with all this time shifting. So, as a film, this only gets three stars from me.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray DVD - and I think the standard DVD - has a large group of special features, though many are short and one is really odd. They consist of:<br /><br />Making the Iron Lady - 12 minutes - the standard "making of" featurette with the cast and crew making comments among scenes repeated from the film.<br /><br />Recreating the young Margaret Thatcher - 3 minutes<br /><br />Denis, The Man Behind the woman - 2 ? minutes - focusing on Jim Broadbent's character<br /><br />Battle in the House of Commons -2 ? minutes - mostly comments by the Director (and some repeats section from the "Making of" one<br /><br />Costume Design: Pearls and Power Suits - 2 ? minutes - comments from the costume designer and Director<br /><br />And the odd one: an 18-minute "featurette" on Historical film bios, that - while interesting - is a promo piece for other recent DVDs of Weinstein Company produced films. We learn about Marilyn Monroe (from film historian Drew Casper and actress Michelle Williams), Wallis Simpson (the film W.E. where we hear from a professor and the film's director Madonna) , The Iron Lady (with comments by the book version's author John Campbell and Streep) and one more film I forget. It seems to have been edited from a longer piece because there is a narrator but no title or credit.<br /><br />So, if you want to see a great actress inhabit a role, this is the film. But if you want to learn a lot about British history during Thatcher's career, I'm afraid this is not the best place to find that.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

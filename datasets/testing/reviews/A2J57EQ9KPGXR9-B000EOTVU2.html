What's worse, it portrays itself as some nifty little horror film but it is just a "dumb kids do stupid stuff and wind up getting killed" type of slasher flick.<br /><br />Halfway through the film, I was rooting for the killer or another meteor to come crashing down on top of the lame characters in this ode to boredom. Take a pass on this one.</p></body></html>

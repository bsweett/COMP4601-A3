But what distinguishes "Red Eye" from the latter is some really profound characters' study. For some reason Jody Foster's film was a one night stand for me, but I really enjoyed "Red Eye" and I think I'm gonna enjoy it again one day. The script is very well written, the characters are vivid and lively, and director's work gives away a real professional. Wes Craven is a true professional, although he used to make low-budget horror movies that sometimes were silly and naive. But now we see that given if not a megabudget, but a pretty decent one, he can make good cinema without a lot of effort seemingly. Once he already made an excellent film with big money involved (I'm talking about "Wes Craven's New Nightmare") and now he proved he can create an interesting and exciting flick in other genre. Craven works great, I'm sure he'd shoot an awesome love story if he has to.<br />"Red Eye" is everything a good thriller should be - it's intense and gripping, it's surprising and very well crafted. The moment when you realise what's going on is done so perfect, I felt shivers down my spine.<br />The casting is just outstanding, and that's another Craven's merit. The film could have done much more worse with big stars, so Craven took rather well-known actors, but not THAT big. Rachel McAdams is very pretty on one hand, on the other she can really act, and you feel some inner strength in her. Cillian Murphy is just beyond any praise, I sincerely think this guy has a tremendous future as an actor.<br />I'm not sure you'll like "Red Eye" that much to buy it on DVD, but it is definately worth a walk to a theater or a DVD-rental.</p></body></html>

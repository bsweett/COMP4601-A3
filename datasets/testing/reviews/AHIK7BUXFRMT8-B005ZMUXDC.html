<meta name="summary" content="New Art with the Traditional Disney Formula"></head><body><p>First of all let me say the movie is pleasant and entertaining and one the kids will undoubtedly enjoy. All of the classic Disney elements are there, the lovely heroine, the awkward hero, the loveable sidekick, the fearful villain, and a sympathetic chorus of unlikely defenders. Disney re-mixes these familiar elements into a new concoction based on the Grimm's fairy tale of Rapunzel.<br /><br />There is nice music and singing and plenty of humorous situations to delight the young and the young at heart. Disney has decided to update the dialogue to reflect current phrases and words that are very contemporary and up-to-date. While this may be engaging to the younger audience it imposes a timeframe which will date it before too long as language usage changes quickly.<br /><br />If you have youngsters in the house this will be a winner.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just average across the board"></head><body><p>Everything from the plot, dialogue, directing, and acting is just average. Matt Damon's character is beyond boring, Angelina Jolie wasn't needed, and the other top actors just have bit roles that don't amount to much. Like another review here mentioned, the deaf girl was by far the best and most interesting character. When your watching a movie about the birth of the CIA, you expect a little action, especially in a three hour film.</p></body></html>

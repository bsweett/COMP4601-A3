Stop.......<br /><br />Okay, it wasn't the worse film I've seen, but it definitely ranks as one of the worst vocally presented musicals ever. Ever. Outside of the wonderfully talented young voice of Amanda Seyfried, I haven't heard singing this bad on film since Jack Nicholson in Tommy or George Burns in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Even though Meryl Streep should be given the "Best Try" award for looking like she was having a good time while not showing embarrassment, "singers" like Pierce Brosnan sound like they were soulless barking dogs and needed to be put out of their misery. Sure, visually the movie is a fun romp, but if I hear Meryl either sigh, cry, or moan during each song again, I swear I'm gonna buy me a chalkboard and scratch away. I find it hard to believe the Broadway play it's based on is so huge, but then again it's based on music that helped define a generation...just not mine. Heed this warning: unless you are a bonafide ABBA fanatic or simply "ghey" for musicals, do yourself a favor and rent Across The Universe again than to put yourself through this.

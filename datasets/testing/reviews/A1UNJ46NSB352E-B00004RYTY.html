<meta name="summary" content="Interesting premise"></head><body><p>This movie explores the variations that affect our day.  Most of the time, small changes wouldn't mean much.  But, when life is on the line, one small change can have a profound impact on the following decisions, events, and coincidents.  This movie is brave enough to show them, taking a page from Rashomon, which shows the same events from 3 different perspectives.<p>However, where this movie lost me was caring for the characters.  The boyfriend whose life is on the line is a gangster, a drug dealer.  Why would I care if he lives or dies?  So he can poison the youth later on?<p>Overall, the DVD is average.  There's not many extras, but it is a 2-sided DVD that has both widescreen and full-screen versions (for those of you that like to miss 40% of the movie).  This movie may worth a watch, not much more.</p></body></html>

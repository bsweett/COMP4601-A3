<meta name="summary" content="The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen as it should have been"></head><body><p>I was expecting something along the lines of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen when I caved in to go see Hellboy last night; you know, a bunch of unlikely paranormal misfit heroes working together to save the world from destruction.  Okay, well, it was a lot like TLEG in theory, but much better in practice. Comic books turned into movies don?t normally thrill me, but in this movie it wasn?t difficult for me to suspend my disbelief in spite of some stretched plot lines.<p>Ron Perlman plays Hellboy, who is apparently an imp from a rift in the universe that occurred as a result of tampering by the German army during WW2.  Something went terribly wrong with their ?experiment?, resulting in a few people and things being sucked in from our universe to the other side in exchange for?what? before the hole was shut down.  He is raised lovingly in an American government facility by the bespectacled professor that discovered/rescued him in Scotland.  A couple of other paranormal misfits ? Liz the firestarter  and Abe the blue psychic fish man ? are basically his adopted siblings.  The trio is trained to use their powers for heroic good.  Their existence is of course top secret, which explains why there are public rumors everywhere about Hellboy.<p>But wait?those nahtzis (spelled wrongly on purpose!) aren?t dead yet! They have unleashed Hellish creatures upon our world, which only multiply when they are slain.  In fact they?ve come back for the now-grown Hellboy sixty years later so that he can complete his destiny, which is somehow tied in with reopening that rift between universes.  The legendary Rasputin (who has occultic powers of his own) has concocted this plot to lure Hellboy and his entourage for a final showdown in Moscow.  <p>The plot had its flaws but the visuals had none.  I liked the action sequences and special effects, which centered mainly on the multi-tentacled creatures that Hellboy and co. spend most of the movie destroying.  CGI and makeup were used flawlessly to create the human and beastly monsters.  There was also a nice romance subplot between Liz (Selma Blair) and Hellboy, which begged the question; can a man overcome the monster within himself for the sake of love?  Yes, echoes of Perlman?s former tv role, but with a lot more testosterone and realistic emotions.  It was a surprisingly UNcheesy love story amidst all the action.<p>I could have wished for more backstory about Abe and Liz, but that?s my only real gripe.  It comes down to this:  do you like action movies, comic books and/or rooting for weird superheroes?  Then you?ll probably enjoy Hellboy.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle.</p></body></html>

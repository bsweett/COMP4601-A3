Though he claims that Edward Norton edited the film to allot himself more screen time, most believe there is something deeper at work here.<br /><br />Equally as interesting: this film's script-ending is dramatically different from the end-product. To avoid spoilers, check the bottom of IMDB's trivia for this film for the shocking details!! (Though this conclusion is alluded to in the actual film-ending, it is made blatant in the script).<br /><br />If for some strange reason "Fight Club," "Red Dragon," "Death to Smoochy," and "Primal Fear" did not convince you that Norton has TREMENDOUS range, this film will. Not only did Norton physically transform himself for this role by gaining THIRTY pounds of muscle, he mentally accessed the very dark place where hatred resides. His character is all-too-believable. A credit to his talent, indeed!!<br /><br />Those who find this film only reinforces stereotypes seem to miss how the film portrays the both the irrationality of racism and its insidious nature. This is especially evident in the character of Seth. That fact the Seth refuses to eat a black jellybean because of its color paints a pretty clear picture. On the other hand, the film does not hesitate to show the viewer that many members of hate groups are intellectually gifted: like Derek and Danny. Circumstance has pushed these young men to seek a new father figure, and they find comfort in the attention provided by Cameron (leader of the fictional D.O.C. or Disciples of Christ). Chilling!<br /><br />Several people here claim the black-and-white scenes are "artsy." Entirely untrue. They have a very clear purpose: they exist simply to indicate "the past." (It is a common film-device. . . as nearly all of you reading this know). In no way does this detract from the film. In fact, it makes several graphic scenes more tolerable.<br /><br />If you are interested in film art, keep an eye on the use of the sea ... and pay specific attention to the diner-scene (near the conclusion) where Norton stands in front of a sea-scape painting . . . his head engulfed in the waves. That which was once so alive becomes frozen in time. (Read into it what you will!)<br /><br />Though there are some sexually explicit scenes, it is a great film for a college classroom or for a very mature teenager (though, if I were a parent, I would not want to watch it WITH my child). Some see the work as heavy-handed . . . I think it is quite real.<br /><br />A must-see for any Norton fan or anyone interested in human-behavior.<br /><br />Suggested Reading: Roth, Luanne.

<meta name="summary" content="Should be called "Bad Movie Island""></head><body><p>I don't understand why this movie has received so many positive reviews. "Shutter Island" has the makings of a good thriller but never gets off the ground. The plot is good, the cast is great, and the cinematography is super cool. But everything else is just downright stupid: not scary, not creepy, and super obvious. I felt like Scorsese was dumbing down to his audience the whole time. The trailers for this film were much better than the actual movie. Skip this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rainbow of magic"></head><body><p>I finally managed to go out and see this magnificent work of art.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Narnia world since I was a little kid growing up in Poland. I remember reading the books and watching any TV movies made about this magical world.<br /><br />Seeing this on the big screen in the dark theater was so powerful, so loud, alive and colorful that I almost forgot I was watching a movie, I felt like I was there in person.<br /><br />The four kids, Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy Pevensie were totally new faces to me but I trusted them to tell the story well and they sure did. I found little Lucy to be the most adorable little girl ever, she was delightful and heartwarming and a real pleasure to watch.<br /><br />I loved the scenery, from the land to never ending winter to the thawing spring breaking through, to the evil and cold witch, who appeared somewhat nice only to be rigid and heartless, to the animals, the fawns, centaurs, wolves, cheetahs, rhinos, flying gryphon's, beavers, polar bears, buffalos and ghouls and goblins down to the magnificent Aslan.<br /><br />I was a wimp, I shed a few tears along with few other people in the audience at the tender and sad scenes, but overall I felt like I've spent 2 magical hours of land of sorcery and shining armor.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie, and not to be missed whether you read the books or not, do yourself a favor and enjoy it.</p></body></html>

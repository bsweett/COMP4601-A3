<meta name="summary" content="Suspenseful. Unusual. Star-Studded. Intriguing."></head><body><p>Interpreter is a suspense thriller about the brutality of African politics, an assassination plot, and an UN interpreter who overhears an incriminating clue. For two suspenseful hours, the investigation is just a half-step behind the forces of darkness in fulfilling their mission. Chasing down every lead, the federal agents may not succeed in protecting the target: President of a small African country torn by internal dissension.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman does a beautiful job portraying the interpreter. Sean Penn becomes the Secret Service agent assigned to protect the foreign dignitary and investigating the UN interpreter. A good movie which overperforms driven by top star performances.</p></body></html>

The original cast and crew return for the sequel to one of the all-time greatest horror films. While the film is supposed to take place on the same night as the original massacre, it was actually filmed three years later. Many members of the cast, most notably Jamie Lee Curtis have aged since then but hey, it's all in fun, right? <p>Michael Myers isn't dead and he's still killing teenagers like nobody's business. His shrink, Dr. Loomis is still trying to warn the residents of his old neighborhood but little is being done. The original victim, Lorie Strode is in the local hospital so it's only a matter of time before Myers shows up there and perfoms surgery on the staff. <p>&quot;Halloween II&quot; is not quite on the level of its classic predecassor but it is still a worthy sequel. It does rely a lot more on gore than the original but this is to be expected. Donald Pleasance is the real star here. With Curtis nearly catatonic through the majority of the film, Pleasance really steps up. His portrayal of Loomis is such an intergral and often overlooked piece of the Halloween series. Without Pleasance in the latter films, the Halloween series has become just another run-of-the-mill slasher series but these earlier films were real treats.</p></body></html>

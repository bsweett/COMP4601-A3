<meta name="summary" content="Warning- ACTION OVERLOAD!!"></head><body><p>Bruce Willis is back as John McClane and ready to battle it out with more terrorists. Hackers plan to shut off the country's power supply so they can get into everyones bank accounts. Timothy Olyphant is good as the main villain, but by the end I was a little tired of him. He is sort of weak, but luckily his henchwoman played by Maggie Q isn't. She is not a martial arts actress whatsoever, but still looks great throwing Bruce Willis around. Cyril Raffaelli is Olyphant's other main henchman, and he gets to show off his amazing athletic skills in a good short fight with Willis. Willis does fine in the fight scenes. Not pretty, but he gets the job done.<br /><br />The comedy is good for the most part, and the whole movie is enjoyable. Halfway through I started wondering if the action was gonna pick up a little bit, and I ended up getting more than I asked for. The action gets so crazy that I had to sneak back in and watch it all again.<br /><br />4/5</p></body></html>

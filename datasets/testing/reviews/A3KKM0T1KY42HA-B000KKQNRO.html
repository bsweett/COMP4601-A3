<meta name="summary" content="Holy Whodunit!"></head><body><p>Holy Mother of Mary! How do you describe a movie that asks you to "seek the truth" where the "truth" puts one of the foundations of Christianity into question?<br /><br />Well, in a nutshell, I'd describe The Da Vinci Code as a classy whodunit with a religious twist. Tom Hanks again proves to be one of the best actors in Hollywood by bringing Dan Brown's character Robert Langdon to life.<br /><br />Rare is it that a film adaptation of a novel is as good as the book. And The Da Vinci Code re-confirms that axiom. But The Da Vinci Code delivers. It's entertaining. Thought provoking. Controversial. Suspenseful. Thrilling....It has all the main ingredients of the book.<br /><br />2 and a half hours is a bit long, but kudos to Ron Howard and the producers for not editing out key details just for the sake of time. In fact, even at 150 minutes the film adaptation comes up a bit short on explaining the significance of a few of the details that would put the story into a more clear perspective.<br /><br />But overall, it's an enjoyable movie for open minded movie goers. Is it fact or fiction? That's for everyone to decide for themselves. It is indeed a philosophical idiom fielded to the public under the guise of a Whodunit-mystery.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Arguably the greatest British film ever made"></head><body><p>One could make an exceptionally good case for this being the best film ever made by a British production company. Certainly, it is at worse one of the very best. The film impeccably freezes in our imaginations images of post-war Europe in general and Vienna in particular. And anyone who has seen this will discover scene after scene emblazoned in his or her memory. Indeed, this film is a succession of stunning images and scenes: the first time we see Harry Lime (Orson Welles), lurking in the shadows of a doorway, hands in pockets, an ambiguous, almost apologetic yet amused smile. The Ferris wheel towering over Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) as he waits to meet Harry Lime. The extraordinary "Cuckoo Clock" speech that Harry delivers as he and Holly ride the Ferris Wheel high above the "ants" below. The chase through the sewers. The unforgettable as Anna Schmidt (Valli) walks towards and then past Holly as Anton Karas plays utterly unforgettable zither piece known today as "The Third Man" theme.<p>An enormous amount of great talent was involved in this picture, and nearly all were at the height of their powers. Graham Greene produced one of the great scripts the movies has seen, about an hack writer who has arrived in post-war Vienna to take a job that has been offered him by his old friend Harry Lime, only to discover that he has died in a car wreck. In talking with various friends, the friend, Holly Martins, discovers that the various stories told about Lime don't quite mesh with one another. The climax of the movie comes when Holly learns that Harry not only didn't die but also is making a fortune on the black market. Joseph Cottons turned in perhaps the finest performance in his career as the good natured, but always-one-step-behind Holly Martins. Orson Welles was never better as an actor than he was in this film as the enigmatic Harry Lime, managing to be both thoroughly charismatic and completely reprehensible at the same time. Trevor Howard was as solid as always as Harry Lime's nemesis Major Calloway. Many, many of the minor characters turn in memorable performances. Today, Carol Reed is not well remembered in the United States. This is unfortunate, because he was a truly first rate director with many very fine movies to his credit (among which I do not include the hard-to-take OLIVER). Part of the reason for this has been the widespread influence of French auteur criticism, which pretty much tarred all British cinema with the same inconceivably broad brush, excepting perhaps only the work of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. As much as I enjoy the work of the latter (jointly known as "The Archers"), I believe that Carol Reed is not as appreciated as he deserves. This film certainly is highly regarded, but he left behind many, many other superb films that also deserve continued viewing. At any rate, regardless of the amount of attention his work as a whole received, this film incontestably remains one of the truly great films in the history of cinema.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One man against Armageddon"></head><body><p>I have to admit I haven't gotten around to reading the original book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425184226">The Sum of All Fears</a> on which this movie is based, but a quick skim of other reviews suggests that the script doesn't follow it very closely.  Some time in the very near future, CIA analyst and historian Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) finds himself caught up in a plot by European Neo-Nazis to set the U.S. and post-Communist Russia against each other so that they can, presumably, sweep up whatever pieces are left (which strikes me as not the smartest plan going).  As in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305182043">The Hunt for Red October</a>, Ryan finds that many people in positions of power aren't prepared to listen to what he has to say, and only by a bold stroke is he able to carry out his self-appointed mission of stopping the missiles from flying.<br /><br />Of course, like all Tom Clancy movies, the story is far too complicated to summarize in the space I'm given here.  And I have to give it points for all-too-probable scariness: in a world where building a small, dirty atomic bomb is almost within the reach of a high-school physics student, to say nothing of disaffected political groups with agendas of their own, what happens on celluloid could well happen for real some day.  What bothers me most about it is that, apart from its similarities to "Red October," it seems to be out of chronological order.  The original book was published in 1991, seven years after "RO."  Affleck's Ryan is not only clearly much younger than Harrison Ford's (and even considerably younger than Alec Baldwin's), he isn't even married yet (he's dating a second-year medical resident who doesn't have a clue about what he really does for a living)--now surely it wouldn't have been difficult to establish him as a family man, and it might even have added to the suspense.  Would it have been all that improbable, given that most Americans in positions of power today still remember all too keenly the days when "Russia" was the bugaboo of our nightmares (think Cuban Missile Crisis), for Ryan to have met with obstructionism from them, even after his success with Marko Ramius?  And for some reason Affleck himself just doesn't engage my sympathies as Ford and Baldwin did.  It's not a bad movie, but it's unlikely to become one of my favorites.</p></body></html>

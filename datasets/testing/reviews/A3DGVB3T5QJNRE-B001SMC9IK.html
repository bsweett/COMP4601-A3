<meta name="summary" content="A Sobering Story About The Stupidity Of The Human Race!"></head><body><p>This is a profound story about human arrogance. Most of the developed world and plenty of the undeveloped world believes when it comes to the environment that Might Makes Right! End of story! It's what capitalism is based on! Plants and animals and landscapes don't have legal standing! In other words, they have no rights! In the Day the Earth Stood Still, the tables are turned on the human race by extremely advanced extraterrestrial aliens, and then we have NO RIGHTS! Now we get to see how it feels when our species is considered to be like a virus needing to be destroyed in order to save all other life on the planet. Based on the poor reviews this film received by most people, I guess the storyline has hit a nerve! Good!<br /><br />I want to thank Hollywood for having the courage to make such a deep film in a world so crass and shallow! It's a sheer pleasure to watch a movie with a message than the usual dribble that constantly makes it to the big screen!!<br /><br />For other great Science Fiction see:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAE">Zardoz</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAC">Enemy Mine</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TZN7KQ">Fantastic Planet</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXP">A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630587493X">Bicentennial Man</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S86J0I">Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)</a><br /><br />Also see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976658348">Divine Destruction: Dominion Theology and American Environmental Policy (Melville Manifestos)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0646148710">Nihilism Incorporated: European Civilization and Environmental Destruction</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521003482">The Destruction of the Bison: An Environmental History, 1750-1920 (Studies in Environment and History)</a></p></body></html>

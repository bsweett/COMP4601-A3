I recently purchased it and I definitely have a different view of the movie and really enjoyed it. I have watched it several times since the purchase. The characters are hilarious cliches. I really enjoyed Jeff Fahey and Michael Biehn as two brothers trying to get the best BBQ sauce in Texas. Josh Brolin is excellent as Dr. Block and his wife Dakota and her father are just great characters.<br /><br />Really like this movie for all it quirkiness and for it drive in style.</p></body></html>

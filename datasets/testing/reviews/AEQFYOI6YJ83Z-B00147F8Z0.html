Or words to that effect.  I believe them, whole-heartedly.  The problem is, when there IS something to see, make sure your audience can freaking SEE it.<br /><br />That was the main problem with this film: It was way too dark.  If you haven't seen it yet, you might be thinking: "Oh, get over it.  Horror movies are supposed to be dark."  Yes, they are.  But when your central character (in this case, an Alien-Predator hybrid) is never revealed, because it's always in shadows...then there's a problem.  It's obvious the Brothers Strause were going for atmosphere, which I admire.  However, they completely failed--what we have is a picture in which all the great fight scenes are obscured, where a character dies at a central point and we can't even see which character it is.<br /><br />Everyone else has said it, so I shall too: I'm a huge Aliens and Predators fan.  I grew up on the movies and the toys; some of my first reading material consisted of the Aliens and Predators novel series (which may explain a thing or two about my twisted imagination).  Don't get me wrong--I wasn't expecting gold here.  The plot is lame, the acting is horrific, the dialogue is abominal--you know the drill by now.  But, gosh darnit all, it's a freakin' ALIENS AND PREDATORS movie--with an Alien-Predator hybrid!  If that's not something for us Alien/Predator fans to drool over, then I don't know WHAT is.<br /><br />The film was just poorly made; that's it.  The special effects would be great, if we could see them.  We'll ignore the numerous plot holes: characters actually running on foot into town, when they have the time and mental clarity to grab a set of car keys and take the SUV; how the Aliens' acid blood doesn't melt everyone and everything it falls on (that helicopter should NOT have been able to fly); how the single Predator can take on two or three Aliens at a time without his gun...these things are, in the long run, meaningless.  We aren't expecting the Academy Awards to acknowledge this pic.  We just expect good special effects, with a lot of violence and gore and slime and beastie-on-beastie action.  And we get it--we just can't see it.  That's the movie's ultimate downfall: It fails to deliver its goods.  Maybe next time (because you know another one's coming), we'll be able to see what happens.  As for now...well...watch the first one?</p></body></html>

Those very people ate their words when the film came out and got great critical acclaim, and was a nice hit at the box office. "Rocky Balboa" was the perfect end for the legacy. A surprising film filled with a lot of heart and character. The best Rocky since the classic original. So, with that success, what would Sly do next?. Why, resurrect the other iconic character he has. One John Rambo. Again, just like with Rocky, the public laughed at the thought. Rambo?. Stallone pulled off the unexpected with "Rocky Balboa", but could he do it again?. Could Sly strike lightning twice?. In one way, yes. In another, not quite. We'll get to that in a bit. One way or the other, what Stallone did was deliver the biggest and bloodiest Rambo yet. As Randy from "Scream 2" says - "Carnage candy!". So, what is it all about?.<br /><br />We find John Rambo catching and selling snakes in Thailand, and boating around. He is years removed from his adventures of yesteryear and is just living life. That all changes when he is approached by a group of missionaries(featuring Julie Benz, 'Darla' to us "Buffy" fans), who want him to take them on his boat into Burma, an incredibly war torn place, to help aid there. Of course, just as you would expect, it all doesn't go too well, and before long, Rambo is back in action hero mode when he has to invade the place to help rescue them.<br /><br />The plot of the film may not be a giant leap, but it works. And this is Rambo, after all. Sure there has been the angry bitter vet we knew in the past films, but it all comes down to action and explosions. How much stuff does Rambo blow up?. How many people does he kill?. The very, very short answer for that is - A LOT!. Seriously, this is one of the most violent, bloody movies I think I have ever seen. I've seen a lot of stuff in my day, but even I was surprised and taken away by the sheer amount of violence in this film. It pulls no punches. The end shoot out made the storming of the beach scene in "Saving Private Ryan" look like something out of a Disney film. It is brutal. And don't ask me what the end body count is. I lost count. If that's what you want in your movies, or in your Rambo movie, then you will most definitley not be disappointed in the least. Stallone also directs the violence and the action scenes in the film with such ferociousness that it really does feel like it's actually real. Sly did a bang up job in that area. No doubt about it.<br /><br />And then we comes down to the cast, the acting, and so on. Really, it's Stallone's show here people. I'm not complaining whenever Julie Benz shows up, but most of the cast is there to be kidnapped, or shoot guns. It's all about Stallone. Look, Stallone may never win the Best Actor Oscar, but he brings his Rambo and Rocky to life. He writes these films, and has directed a good many of them too. Some may mock and make fun of the Slyster, but there is no doubt that he is a very talened guy, and is probably far smarter than a lot of people give him credit for. He may be over 60 now, but would you of thought so if you didn't already know that piee of info?. I know I wouldn't. He jumps into the role full on from the get go and is just as capable and incredibly strong and buffed in this as any of the other three films in the series. He looks great. I know he could probably whip me with one hand tied behind his back. Looks and acting aside, John Rambo may not resonate with the people as much as Rocky did/does. In that regard, the movie doesn't come close to reaching the heart and spirit of "Rocky Balboa", but Rambo, the movie and character, is what it's always been. Fun, heroic, action packed, and entertaining.<br /><br />"Rambo" was a welcome return. To me, Stallone succeeded with this film in the way he did with "Rocky Balboa" because, for starters, I thought it was a good movie. It delivered the goods one usually expects from a Rambo movie, and then ups the ante. It showed that yes, Stallone could do it again, both as the actor and that the character can still hold up. He was up for the challenge. He passed with flying colors in my book. Where it doesn't quite succeed like "Balboa", was that Rocky felt finished. Like it had come full circle and was done. With a Rambo 5 already being talked about, I guess Sly knew he was not done with this character. "Balboa" also hits on a more human and emotional level. The type of character work and study is not quite apparent in "Rambo". The ending of the film was very interesting. Maybe Rambo 5 will have more of what I am talking about?. It certainly ends in a way that makes a Rambo 5 intriguing.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to say how deeply missed Richard Crenna is. He was a fine man and a great actor. He was as much a big part of these movies as Stallone. It seems weird not having him around. It was nice that he was shown in a flashback scene. At least they got him in there somehow.<br /><br />Rambo 5?. Bring it on!</p></body></html>

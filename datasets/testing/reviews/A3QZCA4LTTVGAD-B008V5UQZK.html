This warm-hearted comedy stars Nia Vardalos (who also wrote the script) as Toula, a Greek-American woman who works in the family business. She falls in love with the WASP-y Ian Miller (a very charming John Corbett). Can true love conquer the cultural differences between their two worlds?<p>As someone who comes from a half-Italian, half-Puerto Rican heritage, I can tell you that I could relate to this story 100%. While grounded in the specifics of Greek-American life, the story handles this theme in a way which I believe has universal appeal.<p>Vardalos and Corbett are part of a superb ensemble cast that includes Michael Constantine, Lainie Kazan, and Andrea Martin. These last three in particular do a great job in creating characters that are hilariously outrageous, yet very human and loveable. The humor in the film is an effective blend of silly slapstick, uproarious sight gags, and character-driven humor.<p>"Wedding" is a film about dealing with a sometimes embarrassing extended family, having pride in your heritage, and reaching across ethnic lines to find romantic love. It's a wonderful film that I recommend to viewers of all ethnic backgrounds!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="By bringing a child in this world, we accept a duty of love and care, even if the child has a stinger at the end of her tail..."></head><body><p>I rather liked most of this film, with the exception of last 10 minutes, which were very weak and disappointing.<br /><br />I believe that it is hardly a SPOILER to say, that this film is basically about two genetists, Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley), colleagues, friends and lovers, who, after facing budget cuts decide to make an illegal experiment, by cloning a chimera made of a mixture of DNA from a human, animals and the DNA of a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO), a kind of huge worm, which they earlier (legally) created. The result of this illegal experiment will be a facinating quasi-human intelligent creature, a little girl, which with time, for reasons you have to discover yourself, they will call Dren (Delphine Chaneac). Some more limited SPOILERS ahead.<br /><br />Maybe it is because I have myself two young children, but rather than the SciFi elements I immediately rather focused on the child they brought to the world and what would become of her. Because they are afraid of consequences and still not certain if they will allow Dren to even live, Clive and Elsa hide her - and therefore ipso facto they keep her prisoner. Therefore, as far as my personal perception is concerned, this film is mostly about a little girl who was denied her childhood and who suffers for a extended period continuous abuse from her "parents" - or maybe rather should we call them her "abductors"?<br /><br />This is a sad film and a sad story and although Clive and Elsa try to bring some light into Dren's life, she nevertheless still lives in a prison, locked and watched by her gaolers. Being different from humans, she grows fast and as she enters the adolescence, she finally starts to rebel - as all adolescents do. And because of what she is, she has tools to rebel as no other adolescents have...<br /><br />This film is also a kind of study in double, mutual entrapment, because exactly as Dren is being kept under lock by her "parents", they are also stuck with her... Vincenzo Natali, who earlier made the quite impressive "Cube", leads this story very skillfully for almost the whole duration of the film and he rather intelligently describes Dren's late teens rebellion until a breaking point is reached and she severs her emotional links first with her "mother" and then, even more radically, with her "father". This liberation and coming of age (showed in a very Freudian scene between Dren and Clive) is quite beautifully symbolized by her deploying of wings... This final rebellion is also a punishment inflicted to both Clive and Elsa for their cowardly failure to provide the necessary love and care to the child they brought into this world...<br /><br />Sadly, at that moment the director took the film in the completely wrong direction and as the result, what could be a very honest SciFi philosphical tale, crashed and exploded in flames. The last 10 minutes of the film are horribly bad and do not make the slightest sense, at least as far as my personal taste is concerned. This is the reason, why I think this film desserves only three stars.<br /><br />But still, I do not regret that I watched it, as it has many touching moments and for most of its duration it is quite good. And it certainly touched me and made me think many times since about this little strange looking girl with a tail, living her sad, lonely existence locked in basements and barns. About Dren, who never got a chance...</p></body></html>

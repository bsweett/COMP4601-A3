<meta name="summary" content="The Best Thriller Ever!"></head><body><p>Amazing!  This movie was extremely well done!  The suspense is excellent and you are terrified almost the whole movie without seeing any gore, which is a sign of a well made movie and a first-class thriller.  <p>Nicole Kidman was dazzling, I defintely think that she is one of the best actresses out there!  It's amazing how she go from being a courtesan in 'Moulin Rouge' to a religious mother in 'The Others'.  She is extremely convincing in this role!  The others actors were great, I was also very impressed with the kids who played her two children in the movie, they were great!<p>The costumes and effects were excellent!  The set was perfect, foggy, dark, and mysterious, absolutely perfect for this movie.  I won't be surprised if 'The Others' is up for a few Oscars, it sure deserves it!  This is a shocking and impressive movie, go see it!</p></body></html>

What a gorgeous film to look at, the dialogue and music is current and accessbile for younger auidences. I can see why this film won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design, you can't take your eyes off of those over-the-top costumes. I have never been a Dunst fan but she is surprisely good as the doomed Marie Antoinette. Dunst plays the Queen of France very reserved, motherly, and understanding towards her husband's "bedroom issues." I have to admit I hated Sofia Coppola's first film, The Virgin Suicides and I wasn't expecting too much from this film but I felt Coppola stayed true to the life and legacy of Marie Antoinette. I highly recommend giving this film a look at, it's beautiful yet refined. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

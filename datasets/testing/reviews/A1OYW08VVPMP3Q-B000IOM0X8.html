<meta name="summary" content="In search of a lost ironclad"></head><body><p>The plot of this movie is pretty far-fetched: a guy and his friend are in search of a Confederate ironclad which supposedly left Richmond carrying a fortune in gold coins. A clue found by chance seems to point to west Africa, then northwards into the Sahara desert. But there is more than a shipload of gold involved... an environmental disaster threatens the entire Earth, seemingly from the same area.<br /><br />This movie has it all: spies, corporate bad guys, tinpot dictators, high-tech gizmos, romance and even a medical mystery. In fact, it may have just a little TOO much. At times it's hard to catch your breath during this film!</p></body></html>

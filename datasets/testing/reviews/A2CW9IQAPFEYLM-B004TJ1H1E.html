To avoid detection by the gangsters that are after them, they disguise themselves as women and join an all-girls band headed for Florida. In the band is Marilyn Monroe, and Curtis falls in love with her. Joe E. Brown is a rich playboy in Florida who falls for Lemmon in drag.<br /><br />It's one madcap scene after another as Billy Wilder puts all the principals through their paces. The script is brilliant - always suggestive but never crass. Monroe, a bane for the others to have to work with, was a knockout to look at in those gowns she wears. George Raft is the gangster heavy, and he's got two inside jokes that are terrific: the coin flip from SCARFACE and the grapefruit-in-the-puss bit from the Cagney movie THE PUBLIC ENEMY. That great music is provided by Matty Matlock and the best of the 1950s west coast jazzmen. Everything is done just right here; there's not a single false move. It's all wonderful fun and top-notch entertainment. Definitely worth a watch. (Brown has the classic last line.)</p></body></html>

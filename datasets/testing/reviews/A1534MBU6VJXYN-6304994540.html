From its tight plotting to great characters to a string of great quotes, this is truly one of the best movies ever.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski, aka The Dude, a stoner livin in L.A. who enjoys bowling and being lazy. One night, a group of thugs mistake him for a millionaire with his name, and pee on his rug and demand money. Jeff decides to settle things by visiting the elder millionaire who posseses the same name as him. The wealthy Lebowski refusese to compensate for the rug, angering The Dude. However, when Lebowski's wife Bunny (Tara Reid) is kidnapped, he enlists The Dude's help. The Dude is ordered to make a ransom drop, to which he reluctantly accepts. Things go well until The Dude's friend Walter Sobchack (a riotous John Goodman) decides to tag along, managing to complicate manners. The Dude is then plunged into a world of intrigue, encountering hialrious situations, killer nihilists and the perfect match for him, the esoteric artist Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore).<br /><br />This film is a true classic. The special edition dvd comes with a making-of documentary, a photo gallery and few other extras. This isn't a film for everyone, but those who enjoy this type of art-house humor and filmmaking will no doubt be impressed.</p></body></html>

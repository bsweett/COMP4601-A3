<meta name="summary" content="Unforgettable history, incredible circumstances thought provoking film."></head><body><p>This film is one that requires the watcher to immerse oneself in another world. A world of cold war tensions, clandestine operations, high level plants and communist witch hunts. Historical facts not with standing, it is a very enjoyable film and is very well done. The pacing and character development is second to none. The movie is star studded and the talent of those present is easily recognizable.<br /> It does not have 21 cars exploding, bullet time kung fu or little kids out smarting adults, so I suspect the general public of subhuman idiots that is today's movie watcher may complain that it's boring.<br />I highly recommend it</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stunning animation achievement"></head><body><p>Tangled is of course a considerably embellished and altered version of the Rapunzel tale. The story has its ups and down, and is pretty simple overall, without quite as many twists and turns as even films like "The Little Mermaid". However, it does have enough body in the plot to interest viewers young and old. It also has both dramatic and humorous sections.<br /><br />Mandy Moore is quite believable as the voice of Rapunzel, and Zacary Levi (Chuck) does a wonderful job as the rogue she becomes involved with. A tavern scene provides wonderful short performances by the likes of Brad Garret and Ron Perlman. Max the animated horse almost steals the show.<br /><br />However, the real achievement of this movie is the gorgeous animation. Scenery is detailed and better than realistic. Faces are emotional and expressive. Action sequences are fluid and exciting, if of course entirely unbelievable. The imagination of the writers and animators was functioning at a very high level in this film. The floating lantern sequence is a truly unique and spectacular piece of film-making that should not be missed. Sequences involving the sun-flower and its latent effects are beautiful.<br /><br />Criticisms that the film sends the wrong message to youngsters concerning Rapunzel's desire to find freedom from her "fake mother" are ill thought and completely unfounded. She never desired to "rebel" and "seek freedom". Something was obviously wrong in the relationship and she could feel that. Being locked up alone for her entire life was a situation it was only natural to wish to correct.<br /><br />This is a fine entry in the history of Disney animated films, and deserves a high placement in that list.</p></body></html>

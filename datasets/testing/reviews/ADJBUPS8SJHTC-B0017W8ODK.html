<meta name="summary" content="Great movie but sad."></head><body><p>This is my first time looking at this picture, and I have to say that it really moved me. I can see why one shouldn't bear false witness against one's neighbor for true. It seems there are two sisters . One just grown up and serious, and one younger, writing plays and gets herself in business she can't quite understand. Because of this, one is falsely accused and sent to prison; He is only released to go to war. The elder sister moves away from her family hoping to still be with the man she truly loves, and the baby sister is left with a heavy load of guilt. I believe a moral is here for us all to learn. Don't hurt no one if you cannot help them. perhaps that is a bit easy to say, and a child needs to stay in a child's place and mind her business. Because of her own fancies, she hurt two people who could love and be happy together. Because of the war, they lost that. what a interesting movie. I like when they examine the what could happen and we are lead to believe that that is the case, but sadly it isn't. Very good movie.</p></body></html>

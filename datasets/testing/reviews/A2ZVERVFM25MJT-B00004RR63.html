<meta name="summary" content="Classic science-fiction"></head><body><p>This classic piece of science fiction is one of James Cameron's best works, and better than its sequel, excellent though that is.  It begins in the future, with machines ruling the Earth, before backtracking to present day.  It turns out that the machines have sent back a cyborg in the shape of Arnie to kill the mother (Hamilton) of what will be the leader of a human war against the machines.  Yet the humans send back a human protector for the unaware Sarah O'Connor called Kyle.  Thus ensues one of the most compelling chase movies for a long time, with a dark plot that adds to a sense of despair and panic.<p>The acting is all spot on, with Hamilton being especially impressive as the ditzy waitress who suddenly has to come to terms with the fact that she holds the key to humanity's existence.  Surprisingly Arnie is also incredibly well suited to the menacing role of the terminator - the role that launched him into super stardom.  The action sets are all superb too, with some great special effects even by today's standards.  All this and there are some fantastic one-liners, some of which have deservedly gone down in movie history.  However, it is the dark nature of the story that really gives it the nudge above countless other such movies.  The city streets that the heroine runs through look wasted enough for the audience to consider if it's worth saving or not.  That the movie manages to tackle a romantic subplot successfully should also be noted.  This is one of those rare movies where looking back, it is still the genre classic now as it was then.</p></body></html>

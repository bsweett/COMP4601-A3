<meta name="summary" content="Great action movie with Ms. Jolle returning to kick-ass mode"></head><body><p>Who would have ever though 12 years ago that perhaps the best action stars of their generation would be Matt Damon and Angelina Jolle?  Salt essentially is a "Bourne" movie with a female lead.  Evelyn Salt can kick ass as well as anyone and that is pretty much what she does.  The film doesn't promise to be a thinking man's (or woman's) story and has no pretenses.  It is, however a really well done action movie with a star that proves that her stunt work is as good as her acting and her looks.  Packaged up with some standout support from Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor this is how action movies should be made.  Granted, the plot is pretty ridiculous and I was able to figure out the ultimate twist early on.  Still I liked it very much.<br /><br />This Blu ray transfer approaches some of the best quality that can be seen.  Likewise for the DTS-HD Master Audio.  There are several opportunities to show off a good system with a 360 degree soundfield.</p></body></html>

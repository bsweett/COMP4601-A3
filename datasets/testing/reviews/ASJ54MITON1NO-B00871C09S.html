In that sense, it is somewhat realistic in detail regarding set design, although, that might also be the film's drawback. You do get a real sense of the character, through his living environment,  a character confined to a wheel chair, due to a broken leg. At times though, there's a lot of dialogue, and not very much action, like say, North By Northwest. So, if you are prepared for this type of film, then you'll enjoy, Rear Window. Also, featuring Grace Kelly, who's performance is as good as her looks, in this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A more violent, but still enjoyable effort."></head><body><p>November 4th, 2009<br /><br />I don't think it's a big deal, but I will mention that there is some blood in this movie. Not a lot by any means, and not enough to probably give it a second thought, but certain things gave this movie a more mature feel to it. The movie itself starts off slow, and slowly progresses, but once the first major fight scene comes up it barely falls off much.<br /><br />The Lion returns in this effort which by the time half of the movie was over, I was surprised to see, and the Witch from the first one also makes a small return.<br /><br />If you are worried if this is going to be too violent for a kid, I'd say overall it's not. The 1-3 year olds won't sit and watch it that much and the older ones, say 8 and up will find it engulfing and magical as I did. Sure, there is a done-that-been-there feel to it since the movie's first incarnation but Narnia: Prince Caspian is sure to please loyal fans and new fans alike.<br /><br />The ones I'd worry about watching it is probably the more impressionable 4-6 year olds. It may be a bit too intense for them but overall, anyone can view this movie and take something from it.<br /><br />Many have said that this wasn't as good as the first, but in contrast, I must disagree. This one had a special flair to me. Both movies may be a bit on the long side, but I enjoyed them to a good degree, especially when the first introduced itself in 2006 and I went to the theatre to see it.<br /><br />3.75 stars.<br /><br />end note: No, I don't usually rate like that but this movie deserves it. I was more entertained than not here.</p></body></html>

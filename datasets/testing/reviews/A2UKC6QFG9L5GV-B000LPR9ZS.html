<meta name="summary" content="OH YES, THERE'LL BE MUCH MORE BLOOD"></head><body><p>Not being an avid fan of the first Saw and disliking a lot the second one, I nevertheless was very surprised in a good way about the third installment. Yes, it's utterly relentless and gory, I saw people covering their eyes with hands in a theater, even I winced a couple of times although I had seen many of the films alike. But what I liked the most here was not the brutal nature of Saw III (and it's quite important for the fans when a movie lives up to its R-rating, so that they can say money was spent wisely) and not even the intricate story-line that keeps you surprised and on the edge of your seat all the time. Not the final twist which was expected of course but surely you didn't know what it would be exactly.<br /><br />The main merit of the third part is that it doesn't appear to be a usual stupid sequel that lacks ideas, it brings some new sense into the series, glues all the three films together making a perfect trilogy out of it which now can be watched as a one big 5-hour film. There's plenty of flashbacks here that explain a lot from the second and even the first part, and some things become clear that were not in the ends of previous series. It really takes talent to make a movie that not just stands alone, but adds a lot to the other parts and completes them. Guys that were making it are true professionals and real maniacs :)<br /><br />And apart from being as it seems overly gory and graphic Saw III can boast of being rather thoughtful too. The evil genius of Jigsaw (and of the makers of the film) made the characters (and us along with them) think about rage and its manifestations, about revenge and people's insatiable urge to punish those who took their beloved ones. By quite simple examples inclusive of flesh-ripping, bone-crushing, joint-wresting etc. the killer himself shows us killing is bad. Those will survive who don't succumb to the desire of payback. Only forgiving can grant forgiveness for ourselves. And that's the rule for everyone, even for the evil manipulator's apprentice, and it can't be broken. Otherwise death awaits you as well as your victims. In this movie Jigsaw is seen not as an ordinary killer maniac, but as some kind of a teacher if you will. So this time his puzzles must be solved not only using strength, keen wit and will to live, but also by testing your own virtue and that's something new for this kind of flicks, don't you agree?<br /><br />I don't know what they will do with Saw IV, because the third part wrapped it all very nice making a perfectly neat structure of a trilogy. I'd leave it like that. You can top previous parts in respect of blood and guts, but it'll be pretty hard to keep the same level of thoughtfulness the third part established.</p></body></html>

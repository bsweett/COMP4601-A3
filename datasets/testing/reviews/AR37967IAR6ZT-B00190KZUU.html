<meta name="summary" content="Too 'fantastic' to be fantastic."></head><body><p>Tim Burton's BIG FISH is essentially two hours spent hearing the stories of Edward Bloom, the sort of guy who, in real life, would be considered obnoxious and unbearable but, in a movie, is regarded as a quaint treasure. Bloom's tales of giants, circus freaks, werewolves, enchanted fish, enchanted towns and one-eyed witches in the mountains of Alabama are clearly fiction, though not really good fiction. In the film, his son is annoyed - looking to hear a bit of truth from his dad before Bloom drops dead.  All he finds out, unfortunately, is that his dad didn't stretch the truth all that much ... and, apparently, that the truth wasn't really important anyway.<p>Yeah, in a movie, it's supposed to be all uplifting. But I refuse to see Billy Crudup's character in a negative light just because he's the only one refusing his father's painful whimsy. If you were sitting next to Edward Bloom for a long period of time, too, you'd want him to stop talking nonsense, too.<p>BIG FISH, which all Tim Burton fans will rush out to see, is his most grounded-in-reality film, I suppose. It's got a clever group of actors who make the most of the material that they're given.<p>The main problem with the film, I guess, is that Burton himself is far more interested in the colorful world of Bloom's stories. Burton's never been very good at a connected, driven narrative, anyway. It's always been more style than substance.<p>Because of that, Burton all but ignores making the "real life" bits as good as the stylized "stories." And the two elements never really come together. Never is there a moment where we feel the character McGregor is playing becomes the character Finney is playing, and the film needs that.<p>It's pretty to look at, but it's a letdown.</p></body></html>

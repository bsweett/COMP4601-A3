Well, maybe it is because I'm a dumb horror fan who is used to the so called "bad acting," but I really liked this film!<br /><br />Don't listen to those neanderthal whiners, the acting is fine, and it was not as gory as I expected, but did have some great bloody scenes, as it should! When you pick up a case that has a sawed off limb on it, then expect to see some carnage...morons.<br /><br />I'd catagorize this more as a psychological thriller. It starts off with a doctor and a freelance photographer, who are chained in a bathroom, on opposite ends. Between them is a dead body holding a gun and a tape recorder. In each of the mens' pockets is a micro tape with instructions on it. Through the dialouge, the viewer picks up on the fact that there is more to these men than meets the eye.<br /><br />Won't say more about the plot, you need to just go into this without any semi-spoilers. GREAT ENDING!<br /><br />From one horror fan to another, check this puppy out!</p></body></html>

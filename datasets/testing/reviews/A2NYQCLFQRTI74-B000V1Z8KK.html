<meta name="summary" content="action, lots of it"></head><body><p>After his unit leaves him and his best friend Donnie, to die in Ethiopia, former military sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) goes in exile in the Rockies. Three years later, he gets coaxed back into action by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) who requests that he finds a way to plan the President's assassination in one of three cities.<br />In the end, Bob Lee is double-crossed and framed for the attempt. Soon he becomes a fugitive trying to prove his innocence.<br />Naive cop Nick Memphis (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) just "knows" Bob Lee's not responsible for the events. Even though he's on the verge of getting fired, he still wants to help Bob Lee as much as possible.<br />Together they will find the truth.<br /><br />Wahlberg shows signs of good acting.<br />I felt that Danny Glover spoke like Daffy Duck, it was hard to understand him at times.<br />Pe&ntilde;a is excellent as the naive police officer.<br /><br />The shots with heads and arms flying all over are well made and impressive.<br /><br />The script is believable. Bob Lee obviously has no respect for the government, and it is even more apparent when he realizes he's been set up. Even better, Bob Lee was trained to kill, but also how remove weapons from people's hands in order to survive.<br /><br />An engaging, enjoyable movie with a lot of action.</p></body></html>

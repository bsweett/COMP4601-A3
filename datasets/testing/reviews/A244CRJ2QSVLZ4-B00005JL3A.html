The plot, a virus released from a laboratory, is frightening and plausible.  A beautiful cast, led by a multi-talented Milla Jovovich, comprises a group of paramilitary commandoes who find themselves trapped miles beneath the earth's surface in a secret laboratory where illegal genetic experiments are being conducted by the Umbrella Corporation.  It is a "who-will-live-who-will-die" action adventure.  Flesh-eating zombies are not usually my cup of tea but this movie makes them very plausible.  The Red Queen computer is chilling, especially when her voice and hologram are that of a child issuing threats such as "You're All Going to Die Down Here!"  With the advent of avian flu, the movie's T-virus has frightening possibilities.  Thus, the movie remains current and fresh.  It is reminiscent of "The Stand," "Rabid," "The Crazies," and other out-of-control virus movies.  Favorite scene:  When the Red Queen traps four commandoes in a glass corridor and dispatches them with lasers that slice and dice.  A must have for all fans of science fiction/horror.  "Resident Evil" is followed by two strong sequels.</p></body></html>

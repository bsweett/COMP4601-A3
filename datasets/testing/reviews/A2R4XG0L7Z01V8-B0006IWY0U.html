<meta name="summary" content="Very much a "man's" film"></head><body><p>I've never watched Master And Commander before, there's always been something in the way. The length, it wasn't "appropriate" to watch it at that particular moment in time, and the fact that I couldn't (notice the past tense) stand Russell Crowe. But when you're thinking that you'll never agree on a movie to watch, out comes the one that you've never had a chance to watch yet.<br /><br />The thing about M&C is that it's very much a movie aimed at men. There is only one scene which features women, and it's very brief. The rest of the movie features men - manly men, wimpy men, rugged men, MEN. Now, while us ladies like our men, it can be a little bit overpowering especially in a 138 minute long movie. And when some of the cast look like they should be appearing in Oliver. But when you consider that the rumoured love interest for Russell's character was supposed to be Keira Knightley - I'll stick with all the men thanks.<br /><br />But back to the movie. For a 138 minute long movie, I'm surprised that it actually went by so fast. Even the setting didn't get boring - 90% of it is set on a ship after all. And the other setting was Galapagos Islands (I still don't know how to pronouce it).<br /><br />There's a pretty basic plot, but at the same time it's pretty involving, and at one point I was clenching my fists, desperate for the right ship to win. My only quibble was the cast - there was so many of them, I eventually lost track of who was who, and didn't even recognise Paul Bettany, despite having just watched him in Wimbledon. (I thought it was Jason Isaacs - duh.) The cast was very impressive, and all of them played their roles very well - even though I still have no idea who was who. A few of the cast could have easily walked off the ship and straight into a production of Oliver, which made me smile quite a lot.<br /><br />Russell was surprisingly good as well. I tend to stay away from his movies, as I just don't see the appeal. But he's not a terrible actor, and his portrayal of Capt. Jack Aubrey was excellent.<br /><br />There are a few sad moments in the movie, and I started second guessing the ending - but thankfully I was wrong. In my opinion, the ending did fall a bit flat, and it wasn't what I expected, but it was better than what I was expecting. If that makes any sense what so ever.<br /><br />Overall, M&C was an excellent afternoon movie, although I did fall asleep straight afterwards - but fortunately not during! - but just make sure you set aside plenty of time for it, and possibly don't watch when you're in a man-hating mood.</p></body></html>

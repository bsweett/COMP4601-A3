Every time my father took me to the video store, I either rented "Star Wars" or "King Kong".  But it had been probably seven years since I'd seen it.  After watching Peter Jackson's new "King Kong", I really wanted to watch the original once more.  So when I received this collector's tin as a Christmas present, I wasted little time in watching the movie.<br /><br />Everyone knows the story: bigshot movie director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) recruits poor nobody Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) to star in his latest picture.  Carl has a map that will lead him to an island that no white man has ever set foot on.  But rumor has it that some sort of beast rules the island.  It sounds like native superstition ... but as Carl, Ann, and their shipmates soon find out, it's much more.<br /><br />"King Kong" is one of the true cinema classics, and it doesn't take much to see why.  The cast is great.  Scream queen Fay Wray was a great choice for Ann Darrow, while Robert Armstrong really shows us what a cheapskate Carl Denham really is.  Of course, there's also Bruce Cabot as Jack Driscoll, the tough first mate who falls in love with Ann.<br /><br />Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack direct the film with a sense of wonder and intrigue.  (Look for the duo as fighter pilots towards the end of the film.)  The script, by James Ashmore Creelman and Schoedsack's wife, Ruth Rose, is still good, even by today's standards.  Creelman and Rose took a potentially fine idea and turned it into a grand screenplay.<br /><br />And then there's Max Steiner's terrific score.  It switches from mysterious, maybe a little eerie, to horrifying and suspenseful, and then to romantic and dramatic.<br /><br />But, without a doubt, the true highlight of the film is Willis O'Brien's legendary special effects.  O'Brien's stop-motion animation revolutionized fantasy moviemaking.  His effects are still spectacular to this day; one can only imagine how terrifiying and magnificent they must have seemed back in 1933.  Especially fine is the classic fight between Kong and the Tyrannosaurus Rex, as well as the crew's escape from an agrivated Brontosaurus.<br /><br />It's taken many years for "Kong" to arrive on DVD, but at long last it has, and it was well worth the wait.  This 2-disc set is precisely what the film deserves.  The picture looks as fine as could be expected for a film that's over seventy years old.  There's a terrific assortment of special features, including the first audio commentary ever recorded for a film, featuring Fay Wray and Ray Harryhausen.  My favorite of the special features is the enticing documentary "RKO Production 601: The Making of 'Kong, The Eighth Wonder of the World'".  Another wonderful extra is a re-construction of the legendary lost spider pit sequence, by Peter Jackson (who directed the 2005 remake of the film).  The sequence almost seems like it was taken directly out of the original film, and it's as close to the original as it possibly could be.<br /><br />"King Kong" is a classic masterpiece that has lost little of its magic over the years.  Now, a new generation can re-discover this sensational picture on this great DVD set.  The collector's tin also includes a reproduction of the original souvenir booklet, a collection of mini-posters, and a mail-in form for a reproduction of the 1933 theatrical poster.  This set is needless to say essential for fans, and very highly recommended for anyone has yet to experience the eighth wonder of the world.</p></body></html>

It is a mysterious and atmospheric ghost story involving a haunted house, and it builds its tension slowly (like The Haunting from 1963, and Alien from 1979). It is Spanish with English subtitles (and apparently reading them is a huge annoyance for some reviewers here).<br /><br />I will not get into the plot; the less known, the better. I will say that this is a film for people with a solid attention span who enjoy a moody film that features more anticipation of the unknown than it does cheap jolts or hatchets plunged into the head. It's worth mentioning that The Orphanage does feature a couple of ghastly/bloody moments, but not enough for lovers of modern horror movies.<br /><br />What I mean to say is that if you think this might be a cool horror flick, you just might be disappointed. Horror has many little genres to it. Horror fans have different tastes. This film falls into the creepy ghost story category. In addition, it's not only a ghost story, but also a story about loss and family and revisiting the past.<br /><br />I should also mention that The Orphanage becomes a potent mix of creepy and poignant, not unlike The Sixth Sense or The Others. If you liked the feel and look and mood of those films, you may enjoy this. It has good visual style and a very effective musical score.<br /><br />So, turn away from this movie if your tastes lean toward big shocks, blood, revenge, and slashers. This won't satisfy that craving. But if you like films that feature a strong atmosphere of dread, dark hallways, things that go bump in the night, and the supernatural, give this a try.</p></body></html>

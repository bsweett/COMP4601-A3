<meta name="summary" content="Great 3D movie."></head><body><p>This is in my top 5 best lookings kids 3D movies. The train scene on the ice is really cool looking. The blu ray movie alone looks really good. We watch this movie along with Nightmare before Christmas and Christmas Vacation and a few others every christmas. This is a wonderful movie, that will bring out the kid in you and make you believe in Santa again!</p></body></html>

Analysing these events makes us feel better, removes us from the emotions of such a tragedy. But it doesn't really matter what social-colonial or historical factors led up to it; it only matters that the genocide happened. Hotel Rwanda is an edge-of-your seat true account of the courage of one man in the midst of cowardice of many.<br /><br />Accomplished actor Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, assistant manager of a four-star Belgian hotel Des Mille Collines in the capital city of Kigali. Paul is Hutu. Hutus speak ominously on the radio of exterminating "Tutsi cockroaches." UN Peacekeepers in the country are helpless to intervene. All hell breaks loose and Paul's hotel becomes a makeshift refugee camp holding eight hundred terrified Tutsi. Only his quick-thinking is buying his family and the Tutsi moments to live - but for how long? Crazed Hutu hooligans as well as the Hutu army are shooting Tutsi and hacking them to death with crude machetes.<br /><br />The movie is stellar on all counts. It strikes at your heart, gently takes your face, and makes you look in the mirror. As Wyclef Jean wrote in his closing song for the film, "Million Voices," "There's no money, no diamonds that can replace Rwanda."</p></body></html>

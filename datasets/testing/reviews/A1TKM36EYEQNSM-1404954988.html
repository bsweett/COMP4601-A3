This is really a great love story, more about a love of life and how mixed up we all are at times in our relationships.<br /><br />We have a housekeeper who has nothing but her daughter, character and her morality living with a very rich and somewhat well known family in Malibu or Beverly Hills, depending on the timing of the movie.  It is fast paced, sometimes funny, sometimes sad and you also experience a whole wide range of emotions.<br /><br />Brooks does a good job of developing the characters and even the underlying theme has some basis in real life.  Tia Leoni plays a very frustrated housewife who co-owns her husbands 4 star restaurant.  This is a unique role for me to see Leoni in.  I have enjoyed her in Family Man and Deep Impact, but Leoni is superb in this role.  At times you just think, where does she get off with her approach to life?  If she were a real person, you would just be infuriated at her.<br /><br />Cloris Leachman plays her mom, she does a good job in her later years, and it is nice to see someone of her age still acting.<br /><br />This is also a different role for Sandler and he, like Leoni, show that he can truly act, that comedy is not the only thing he is capable of.  You just really like him in this movie.<br /><br />There are some very touching scenes between Sandler and his daughter and the housekeeper and her daughter.<br /><br />This is a good movie, not much language, a little intense at times, but fun and a good story.  Spanglish is worth it.</p></body></html>

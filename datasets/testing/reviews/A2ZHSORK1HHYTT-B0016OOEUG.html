Yes, it is a murder mystery -- who killed Laura?  And we have some really good suspects.  But the big question of this movie is: How is Hollywood going to give this movie a Hollywood ending, when Laura is dead?  Is our poor lamenting police detective going to drink himself into rehab?  Quit the police department?  Kill himself?  This movie keeps you guessing to the end.</p></body></html>

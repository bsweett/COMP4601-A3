Set in both Liverpool, England and the United States, the film provides a view to the Vietnam War era and the challenges faced by those living lives that were impacted by the death of loved ones during a War that many protested, avoided, and / or despised. There is much political and social unrest going on, we see the Rainbow buses, the issues with drugs, and the social unrest that ends in clashes with police and the assasination of Martin Luther King.<br /><br />The central characters are played by Jim Sturgess, whose name is Jude and Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Lucy, a beautiful young girl who sees her first love drafted and go to war only to then attend her first ever funeral, as she sees her boyfriend, decorated as a hero... but buried...<br /><br />Her brother Max, played by Joe Anderson, soon is drafted as well, and her anger at losing those she loves, makes her become part of the protesting groups, at some point endangering her life. All characters move to New York City, where they find an apartment ran by a singer named Sadie, played by Dana Fuchs, who is dating a guitar player by the name of JoJo, played by Martin Luther. As you may be beginning to realize, all names lead to some of the best Beatles songs of our times, and as the plot develops, all circumstances result in listening to our favorite tunes.<br /><br />These young characters are in turmoil over the war, Jude, who is from England, finds that he has no cause and therefore is able to stay outside of the individual turmoil that is consuming his friends, but he falls in love with Lucy and as she gets deeper and deeper into the groups that are protesting the War, Jude finds himself embroiled in the thick of it and because he is in the USA without the appropriate Visa, he is soon sent back home.<br /><br />They want to change the world, to make the world a better place, to hold on to the belief that it is all about love and that love is all we need. But the reality is that emotions are too powerful, hatred reigns, misunderstandings are powerful, and the clash leaves many suffering the consequences of the War.<br /><br />If you like a good dramatic romance, we recommend this movie, but if you simply LOVE Beatles songs like we do, we hope that you obtain this DVD and enjoy excellent music, and a plot that puts the times in perspective for us.  Enjoy!!</p></body></html>

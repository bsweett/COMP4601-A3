<meta name="summary" content="X-Men 3"></head><body><p>This would be a good movie IF it were not called X-Men. They have completely sabotaged the X-Men storyline from the comics. They came up with new stories, which is sometimes ok, but not here. Jean Grey is barely used, Storm looks weak and undecisive, and Scott, why did they even have him there? THe movie left too many things unexplained, changed the X-men Universe and forgot to give some depth to the characters. This is just an action film and only that. Only Wolverine saves the day and the movie.</p></body></html>

That said, lets focus on the movie itself. Wolfgang Peterson took many, many departures from the legend of Troy in this film, and gave a timeless story from the ages a well-worn soap-opera feel. The action sequences were obviously well-planned and are truthfully quite spectacular. If only everyone hadn't seen the Lord of the Rings films, with their very superior army clash sequences. It was as if the fights had been seen before, although the Achilles fights were notable highlights. I bring special notice to Peter O'Toole here, for he brought a special dignity and grace to King Priam, and Eric Bana does a fine job as Hector. Brad Pitt was noticeably very buff in the role of Achilles, although he seemed a bit too much on the pouty side for a great warrior of the ages. Diane Kruger as Helen may have been a bit in over her head here. She honestly didn't have much to do here, except appear here and there in the story. Overall, the film drags a bit, the actors seem bored with the whole thing at times, but it just does work. The DVD transfer was very good, with rich contrast and great sound quality.</p></body></html>

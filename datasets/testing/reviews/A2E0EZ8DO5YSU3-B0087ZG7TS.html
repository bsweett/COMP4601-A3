<meta name="summary" content="Beautifully photographed but overrated"></head><body><p>Gorgeous photography, but the story really drags.  Let's face it - this is a women's movie.  Huge amounts of time wasted on sisterhood themes - jealousies and snooping and deception between Cecelia and Brioni.  Robbie just exudes sensitivity - he goes to war and doesn't seem to fight at all - he just sniffles and cries and longs for Cecelia.  Particularly annoying is time-shifting, which seems to be in vogue today.  The story jumps back and forth for no particular purpose and sometimes events are changed.  Confusing affectation.</p></body></html>

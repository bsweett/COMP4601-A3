<meta name="summary" content="The Best Thriller in Years!"></head><body><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and Jada Pinkett-Smith all give top-notch performances.  All of them are highly likeable characters, even Cruise who plays a hitman who appears unfeeling to his "victims," while being "caring" to others, especially Foxx.  What I liked about this is that it is different from most thrillers.  It doesn't use the same tired tricks that other thrillers seem to use.  (when someone appears dead, he is dead).<br /><br />The movie never gets boring from beginning to end.  This movie looks like a springboard for more roles for Foxx and Pinkett-Smith!</p></body></html>

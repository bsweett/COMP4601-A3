<meta name="summary" content="um...well not so good"></head><body><p>With a plot that makes absolutly no sense if you've seen any of the alien or predator movies and a bunch of faux scares with decent effects but no real gore (which is what you look for in one of these films) AvP falls short, very very short of what it could have been.  The acting is what it could be which is not very good and the alien on predator battles and or fights are really dissapointing.  This is no war.  It's one predator and a human girl fighting a bunch of aliens.  False advertising is what I call that.  A waste of time and money, not just for the consumer but for 20th centery fox as well...really bad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Sci-fi Noir"></head><body><p>One of the most pervasive cinematic formulas is film noir.  There's something intriguing about a dark urban landscape, about characters who pose and speak profoundly, about plots that always involve murder and mystery, and of course, about beautiful women.  Dark City is a noir machine, literally.  It exposes the world as manufactured, genre and artistic formulae as constructed from bits and pieces of the real world.<br /><br />Many American dreams and nightmares seem to merge in noir.  I think Dark City also shows that science fiction captures the imagination much like noir.  Science fiction allows us to explore unknown horrors as well as unknown hopes.  It's rare for a film to be working on so many levels.<br /><br />If you aren't interested in the genres Dark City is working with, you might be missing a good chunk of the film, but you could still enjoy the variation on the "last man alive" plot.  The movie does an excellent job of placing the viewer in the position of the protagonist.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Kiefer Sutherland's performance as the mad scientist is a bit over the top.  He takes you out of the film and you feel like you are watching Sutherland be weird and not an actual character.<br /><br />The DVD version has commentary by Roger Ebert.  The only other film Ebert has done commentary for is Citizen Kane, so he thinks rather highly of Dark City.  I do, too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SeeSaw"></head><body><p>Thoroughly entertaining. Suspenseful. Overall a pretty decent sequel, but not quite as entertaining or well-put-together as the first.<br /><br />The title of this film (just like the original) gives the impression that you might be in for a gratuitous gore fest. While there are some graphic scenes, this movie, like its predecessor, is much more of a CSI/Law and Order crime thriller than a go-for-the-grossout flick.<br /><br />It's a seeSAW story that flips back and forth between a group of kidnapped hoodlums being held in a gloomy, booby-trap filled house and the detective (plus team) trying to find them. There are good twists and turns in the story: Why has the group been kidnapped? What do they all have in common? What do they have in common with the cops that are looking for them? Will any of the kidnapped crew escape? Is there a definitive tie-in with the first movie? All ultimately revealed in this B-actor filled second edition of the Jigsaw killer chronicles.<br /><br />The B-actors selectively put in some pretty good performances. Donnie Wahlberg (Detective Mathews), Shawnee Smith (Amanda) and Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) are great. Franky G (Xavier) is fairly believable at best and the other kidnapees are standard B appearances.<br /><br />There are also some police-work plot holes/believability issues that take some of the realistic desperation away from Saw II. I'd elaborate, but the explanations would take away some of the surprises.<br /><br />So, all in all, I'd say....See Saw. It's certainly worth renting, but not worthy of the original release's collector status.</p></body></html>

His filmography reads like an actor who did just about everything. Drama, horror, sci-fi, western, thriller, comedy, there wasn't much that he hadn't done. For most people, however, he will be forever known for his role as Norman Bates in "Psycho".<br /><br />The film really needs no introduction, as it has been in the public domain for almost fifty years. This is for the small minority who, for some reason, have not seen it yet.<br /><br />The film is essentially about an almost painfully repressed young man who runs a dilapidated motel just off a deserted highway. A woman stops at the Bates Motel one dark, rainy night, and makes an impression on Norman, the young man who runs it. Unfortunately, Norman's Mother does not approve of ANY woman who would come between her and her son.<br />A number of murders take place, and a relative of the woman comes to see for herself what may have happened to her sister. The woman's boyfriend is also curious as to what may have happened, as well.<br />As things turn out, Poor Norman is implicated, and the rest is history.<br /><br />The real story behind "Psycho" comes from a novel written by Robert Bloch, who in turn, got inspiration from the story of Ed Gein, a man who not only killed people in his small Wisconsin town, but made household items from the skin and bones of his victims. There was also talk of his being a cannibal, as well. He was in the final stages of completing a full body suit, made from the skin of a number of his victims, when he was caught (this also served as the inspiration for the character of "Buffalo Bill" in "Silence of the Lambs"). He died in an insane asylum in 1984.<br /><br />"Psycho" is the most popular and beloved of all of Alfred Hitchcock's films. In it's day, it shocked a great many people. It serves as a model of how to make a horror film, and has also served as an inspiration for Gus Van Sant to lens a remake (which was an absolute bomb at the Box Office). There have been studies (I'm not kidding) of how Hitchcock filmed "Psycho", from camera angles, to cutting (editing), to lighting and panning the camera for a certain effect.<br />If you happen to be reading this, and have NOT seen this film, boy, are you in for a treat! If you HAVE already seen it, may I entreat you to see it again, as Classics such as this one never get old!!</p></body></html>

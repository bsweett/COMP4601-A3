<meta name="summary" content="A polished, fun romantic comedy"></head><body><p>I don't watch a lot of this type of movie, but I found "Failure To Launch" to be good fun, and even a little clever: I liked the way various animals kept biting and attacking Matthew McConaughey's character, because they instinctively sensed his antithetical-to-nature lifestyle (sponging off his parents, continually keeping true responsibility at bay, etc.).  It also spends a little time fleshing out the supporting characters and giving them funny things to do... though I could have done without Terry Bradshaw's extended nude scene (I'm not kidding).  I mean, the guy's still in good shape and actually turns out to be a pretty good comedic actor (plus, yeah, it's more of a comic nude scene and not a sex scene), but c'mon.<br /><br />A sharp picture, a handful of adequately illuminating extras, and a main feature running time that doesn't overstay its welcome (the movie is a shade over 90 minutes) make this an easy DVD to recommend, at least for a single viewing.  Romantic comedy fans, and fans of Mr. McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker, likely wouldn't regret taking the further step and owning it.<br /><br />And, oh yeah, I have to give credit where credit is due:  there's a wicked funny scene that sends up Star Wars/science fiction movie geeks that's absolutely priceless.  As someone often accused of being such a geek, I just had to laugh, raise the white flag and admit, "they got me."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Half of Tarantino's best movie. More balance than first"></head><body><p>The outcome of this movie is known to all before they see the movie. The bride will get her revenge and `Kill Bill'. As in many Alfred Hitchcock movies, the suspense is not in the outcome, but how we get there. And, in this movie, the itinerary is well worth the trip. Unfortunately, this means I have to be very circumspect in what I say to avoid giving away any of the key plot points.<br /><br />I've never thought critically about any of Quentin Tarantino's earlier films, so I'm not sure whether this is true of all his movies or just this one, but I get the very strong impression that Tarantino's main directoral influences are Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, with a seasoning of Akira Kurasawa thrown in for good measure. There are long shots with no dialogue which strongly remind me of similar atmosphere shots in `Once Upon a Time in the West'. Also, like Peckinpah in `The Wild Bunch', there is a strong sense of inevitability in the fate of the band of outlaws lead by William Holden and Earnest Borgnine, and dialogue and scenes are taut with the tension of waiting to see how things will all play out.<br /><br />I sensed the influence of Leone as I was watching the film, and this was confirmed in a big way when I saw that several pieces of music by Enno Morricone for `A Fistful of Dollars' was used in the sound track. This confirms my sense that Tarantino shares with Stanley Kubrick and Woody Allan a great talent for borrowing music from other contexts and using it to good advantage in his movies. I was strongly reminded of scenes from the very 1960's feature length documentary `Mondo Cane' in one scene of `Kill Bill', which was no surprise at all when I saw that a piece of music was borrowed from that 40 year old movie for the scene. I really wonder if Tarantino was just lucky with one audience member, or whether he was really being that subtle in evoking a movie obscure to about 80% of his audience.<br /><br />It has been said in many reviews that the casting of David Carradine as Bill was a stroke of genius, bringing to mind his long run as a character in the TV series `Kung Fu'. I will add that Carradine does very well by the part even without that historical connection. All of the other actors execute their parts equally well, with a special kudo to Darryl Hannah for playing a really quirky scene where a large part of her monologue is read from hand-printed notes neatly written in a 3 by 5 inch spiral bound notebook. This piece of business is a small taste of the constantly different way of doing things that Tarantino pulls off better than I have ever seen it done. He does things which, if other directors try it, they take short cuts, and the business falls flat on its face. Tarantino takes no short cuts with important business. The scene between Hannah and Michael Madsen echos the overall course of the whole movie. You are certain that Hannah's character will double cross `Bud', Bill's brother played by Madsen, but you don't have a clue how she will do it. Her method, when revealed, suddenly seems incredibly obvious in the context of the movie.<br /><br />Unlike the final episode of `The Lord of the Rings', which wraps up a story spanning three movies, `Kill Bill Volume 2' can be viewed with little or no loss if you did not see `Kill Bill Volume 1'; however, one of the things which makes it so much better a movie than Volume 1 is the fact that the central plot of the two movies is resolved, and resolved with much less over the top martial arts scenes than in the first part.<br /><br />`Kill Bill Volume 2' is as good or better than any of his other movies, yet, it may not be as enjoyable to watch as `Pulp Fiction'. Key situations are equally as taut, but in spite of the `graphic novel' inspiration behind `Kill Bill', there is none of the `this is really all make believe' sense you have while watching `Pulp Fiction'. The title, after all, does give away the fact that this is storytelling. The grimness and `film noir' feeling in `Kill Bill' is accentuated by the odd red-green emphasis in the color print which I always associate with the filming of `The Matrix'. It adds to the brooding atmosphere of the movie, but I still don't like it. The recollection scenes in plain black and white are almost a relief to watch. It adds to the movie, but I could do without it.<br /><br />Like `Reservoir Dogs' and `Pulp Fiction', the time line jumps around between the main plot line and flashbacks, but every flashback is very cleverly tied into the explanation of a key plot point. While the technique gives me headaches in the hands of some directors, Tarantino has honed it to a fine edge.<br /><br />A must see movie if you like Tarantino or Peckinpah or Kurasawa or film noir. There is a lot less blood and violence than in Part I, so there may actually be less to put off squeamish viewers.</p></body></html>

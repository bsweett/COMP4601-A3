<meta name="summary" content="Good Film But is a Big Fib"></head><body><p>This is an an entertaining, well acted and directed movie except the twist at the end tells you that everything you have seen is a concoction of one of the characters.  This reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock's "Stage Fright" in which the story related in flashback form by Richard Todd to Jane Wyman turns out to be a lie.  This left audiences dissatistifed because they don't like being lied to since they tend to accept the device of the flashback as being the truth.<br /><br />But "The Ususal Suspects" somehow gets away with it, probably because it is simply a better picture than "Stage Fright."</p></body></html>

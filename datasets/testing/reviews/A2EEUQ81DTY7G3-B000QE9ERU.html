<meta name="summary" content=""You can't run away from your memories""></head><body><p>There's a scene about five minutes into the camp action flick The Punisher, where Special Forces veteran Frank Castle (hunky Tom Jane) rises from the dead, strips off his bloody shirt, and reveals his tight, muscled and pumped-up body. It's a feast for the eyes, and pretty much a sign of things to come. For The Punisher - although, fast, furious and fun  - is really just a vehicle for showing off Tom's amazing, sculptured physique. Even though Tom doesn't really get to exercise his acting chops, there's no doubt that he looks just fantastic. And he certainly has more than enough charisma and magnetism to pull off the difficult task of being a bonafide and authentic action hero.<br /><br />The movie begins as Castle is retiring from the F.B.I. His last undercover operation resulted in the accidental death of a suspect who just happened to be the son of the ruthless and cruel Howard Saint (an over-the-top John Travolta). Saint is a hardnosed nightclub owner, money launderer, and corporate tycoon. Devastated by the death of his son and urged on by his wife (Laura Harring), Saint takes revenge by ordering the murder of Castle's entire family. During a beachside reunion in Puerto Rico, Saint's henchmen surround the cottage and methodically shoot them all, including his wife (Samantha Mathis), father (Roy Schneider), and young son (Marcus Johns).<br /><br />Escaping the massacre, but severely wounded, Castle is nursed back to health by a local fisherman. Sporting a beard and drowning his sorrows in booze, he's frustrated at the lack of action by the police in bringing Saint to justice. So decked out in his son's form-fitting t-shirt, Castle launches a grim, brutal crusade against the assorted wrongdoers. He becomes a type of vigilante killer who lives on the edge of society, obsessed with revenge, and uses his guns, explosive devices, and military training, to carry out his pent-up and righteous fury.<br /><br />The Punisher is loaded with grim, sadistic violence but it also has a camp, slapstick quality that is quite appealing. Viewers will be hard pressed to take any of it seriously and most will enjoy getting caught up in the obnoxious, explosive, and often messy fun in the name of cheap thrills. Castle becomes a stripped-down, efficient, lean and mean fighting machine. Secluded in an industrial-looking warehouse in a rough part of Tampa, the rough, ready action man is haunted by the memories of his wife and son. In one of the few quiet moments, his neighbors, three idiosyncratic, harmless bohemian misfits played by Ben Foster, Jon Pinette, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, befriend and take care of him.<br /><br />In one over-the-top scene, Castle raises Frankenstein-like from the bowels of the warehouse. Broken and bloody, he rips off his tattered shirt, exposing his massive physique with thunder and lightening pounding around him. It's a laughable scene but also one of great musculature effect. Much of the movie is like this; it sports a flat-footed, hard-punching style, and maintains a blunt ferocity that makes the film impossible not to like. John Travolta has lots of fun playing the ruthless, slimy villain and it's obvious that he's not taking anything too seriously. As a gristly, heated urban revenge movie, The Punisher is probably one of the best to come along in quite a while, but pity poor Laura Harring. She had such a promising start in MullHolland Drive and it's so unfortunate to see that she's absolutely wasted here. Mike Leonard March 05.</p></body></html>

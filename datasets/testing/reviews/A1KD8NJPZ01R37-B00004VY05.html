<meta name="summary" content="Superbit does look better"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this movie and subsequently bought it twice for the superbit edition. I trotted out another disc player for the occasion and compared the two by switching inputs on my monitor. I thought the colors were yellowish on the first edition and brighter, but with less resolution. The superbit on the other hand was darker, but crisper and showed colors that seemed to be more true. The sound was a little different too, being more subdued during ambients (loudness) and a bit crisper.<p>As for the movie itself, Luc Besson made yet another masterpiece in addition to THE BIG BLUE and THE PROFESSIONAL. I didn't really like this movie when I first saw it (foolishly expecting a deep existential sci-fi), but later realized that this is a good solid-high-budget-feel-good-movie. This and STARSHIP TROOPERS will always be among my top 5.</p></body></html>

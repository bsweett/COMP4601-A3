And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an "iron" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but also gives Tony Stark the ability to fly.<br /><br />I've seen comparisons between the detail and...well...just plain awesomeness that was abundant in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PC6A3E">Batman Begins</a> and Iron Man. And that comparison would not be incorrect. While I'd agree that both had great action and made viewers believe that these superheros actually existed, Batman Begins was more dark while Iron Man kept you giggling at Tony Stark's wise-guy personality...which is true to the comic book versions of the characters.<br /><br />And who better to be in the role of a wise-guy than Robert Downey, Jr. Man, did he nail the role of Stark! And the rest of the cast and acting in the movie were terrific.<br /><br />Iron Man takes you from Stark's creation of the gold-titanium-alloy suit to his confrontation with those that would see Stark Industries commit treason. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written for the screen and the directing will probably put Jon Favreau in the sought-after category.<br /><br />The good news is that Iron Man will be back, but in what capacity is the question. It's well known that Stark (Downey, Jr) has a cameo in 2008's The Incredible Hulk. And it's rumored that the actors in Iron Man have all signed on for two sequels (at the time of this writing Director Favreau has not). But will Iron Man's return be solo, or perhaps with some of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785110828">Avenging</a> buddies? Either way...I can't wait.<br /><br />I will definitely pick up Iron Man for my collection. I don't know about the theaters in your area, but the theaters in mine don't even come close to the picture and sound quality that I get from my home theater. I'm not bragging; I'm just saying that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168ML1G">Iron Man</a> will be a movie that goes into my Blu Ray player the day it's released.</p></body></html>

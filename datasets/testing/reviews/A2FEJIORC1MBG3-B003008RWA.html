Over the opening credits, we are treated to shaky home video, depicting a man pulling up a flap of skin whilst patiently stitching up a gash on his knee with a needle and thread, as Moore deadpans in V.O. (with his cheerful Midwestern countenance) that the gentleman is an avid cyclist- and one of the millions of Americans who cannot afford health insurance.<br /><br />Moore doesn't waste any time showing us the flipside of the issue-even those who are "lucky" enough to have health coverage often end up with the short end of the stick as well. A young woman, knocked unconscious in a high speed auto collision and rushed to the ER via ambulance, was later denied coverage for the ambulance ride by her insurance company because it was not "pre-approved". She ponders incredulously as to exactly how she was supposed to have facilitated "pre-approval" in such a scenario (so do we).<br /><br />The film proceeds to delve into some of some of the other complexities contributing to the overall ill health of our current system; such as the monopolistic power and greed of the pharmaceutical companies, the lobbyist graft, and (perhaps most depressing of all) the compassionless bureaucracy of a privatized health "coverage" system that focuses first and foremost on profit, rather than on actual individual need.<br /><br />Kind of a downer, eh? Well, this is a Michael Moore film, so he gives you plenty of opportunities to laugh through the tears.  Most of the levity occurs as Moore travels abroad to the socialized nations of Canada, Britain, France and Cuba to do a little comparison shopping for alternate health care systems.<br /><br />The classic Moore moment arrives as he sails into Guantanamo Bay with a megaphone and a boatload of financially tapped Ground Zero volunteer rescue worker veterans who are all suffering from serious respiratory illnesses. After learning that the Gitmo detainees all enjoy completely free, round the clock medical care on the taxpayer's nickel,he figures that the state of the art prison hospital wouldn't mind offering the same services to some genuine American heroes. Of course,the personnel manning the heavily armed U.S. military patrol boats in the bay fail to see his logic, and they are unceremoniously turned away.<br /><br />Undeterred, he decides to give the Cuban health care system a spin. They are welcomed unconditionally, and receive prompt and thorough care. Is it a propaganda move by the Cubans? Probably. Does Moore conveniently fail to mention the "minuses" of the Cuban health care system (or the Canadian,British and French systems for that matter)? Sure-but who cares? The "plusses" greatly outweigh the "minuses", especially when compared to the current health care mess in the U.S. (at least he's showing enough sack to step up and give us some alternatives).<br /><br />Moore makes his point quite succinctly-the need for health care is a basic human need. It should never hinge on economic, political or ideological factors. As one of his astute interviewees observes, it is a right, not a privilege.<br /><br />In fact, this may qualify as the least political of Moore's films to date. Consequently, it may disappoint or perplex those who usually anticipate that a Moore film will give them a vicarious "let's go stick it to The Man" thrill. Things are not so black and white this time out; the issue is too complex. I don't think there is any filmmaker out there who could sum it all up in less than 2 hours, but Moore has done an admirable job of scratching the surface, and most importantly, he manages to do so in an entertaining and engaging fashion. After all, isn't that why we go to the movies?</p></body></html>

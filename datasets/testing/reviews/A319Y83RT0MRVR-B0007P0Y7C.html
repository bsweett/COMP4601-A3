<meta name="summary" content="fun, but not the best of the genre"></head><body><p>Hardly an entertaining sequel to Daredevil, this comix adventure focuses more on stunts than a coherent plotline or the execution of such plot. Welcomingly, the stunt sequences and the special effects are much more developed than in Daredevil, yet, it's not enough to save this movie. Jennifer Garner reprises all her mimics as Alias' Sydney Bristow, without the crucial vulnerability of that character. Goran Visinjic's acting talent is underused and he isn't on screen long enough to serve as eye candy.</p></body></html>

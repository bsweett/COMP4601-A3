Actually quite a few of them.  But there were also some parts of the movie that were emotional to watch.<br /><br />Jealousy (of your best friend status) and don't lie - especially to yourself - you have probably been there; drinking too much and making a fool out of yourself; sleeping with someone just so you won't be alone even if the guy is the biggest user/loser on the planet; keeping your eyes open for Mr. Right when he's standing right in front of you; and on and on.<br /><br />Kristen Wiig was great as wounded best friend Annie; Maya Rudolph was perfect as Lillian the bride; Chris O'Dowd was VERY cute as Officer Rhodes; Rebel Wilson/Matt Lucas were the creepiest brother/sister roommates ever; and Melissa McCarthy as Megan was spectacular in all of her role but especially her pep talk.<br /><br />This is definitely a chick flick - a high caliber one at that.</p></body></html>

Mostly with names like Erin Brockovich or Joan of Arc, you'd expect there was going to be some kind of war hero who dies in the end and has never been noticed before. But, in Erin Brockovich, it focuses on a classy new kind of hero that brings a small town to it's feet and huge business to it's knees.<p>Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an unemployed single mother desperate find a job but is having no luck. This losing streak even extends to a failed lawsuit against a doctor in a car accident she was in. With no alternative, she successfully browbeats her lawyer to give her a job in compensation for the loss. While no one takes her seriously with her trashy clothes and earthy manners, that soon changes when she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.. What she discovers is that the company is trying to quietly to buy land that was contaminated by hexavalent chromium, a deadly toxic waste that the company is improperly and illegally dumping and in turn poisoning the residents in the area. As she digs deeper, Erin finds herself leading point in a series of events that would involve her lawfirm in one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history against a multi-billion dollar corporation<p>In Erin Brockovich, you can no longer expect the romantic-comedy type of Julia Roberts. Here, she shines in her role as Erin, a feisty and determined single mom with a plan. It's the first movie in which Roberts really deserves the `career-best' nod, and it will be a movie that she will be remembered for in the future. She is well supported by Albert Finney who handles Ed Masry's anger and happiness perfectly. There is also Aaron Eckhart, who stars as Erin's love interest, to keep us occupied and he is cast nicely and has promise for future roles. Hats off to director Steven Soderbergh (nominated for Best Director twice this year!) and Susannah Grant, who put mindblowing effort into this great picture.<p>One more thing: look out for the real Erin Brockovich as a waitress, and don't miss this film!</p></body></html>

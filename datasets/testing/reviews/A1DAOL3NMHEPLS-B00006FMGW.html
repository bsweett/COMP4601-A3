<meta name="summary" content="Passable but slow-moving tale of a charming con-man"></head><body><p>This is an OK movie, but nowhere near the sizzler some folks have made it out to be. It moves VERY slowly for the first hour or so, and failed to make me care very much about either of the two protagonists. Hanks is good in a basically undemanding role. DiCaprio is -- well, DiCaprio, charming and boyish -- and the script is oddly uncaring about the victims of Frank's Pranks. Worth renting if you are interested in con men, or a fan of Hanks or DiCaprio.</p></body></html>

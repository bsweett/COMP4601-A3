<meta name="summary" content="a little sci fi/ a little action"></head><body><p>If you like sci fi/action movies, this isn't a bad one. If you want depth to your story, try Bladerunner instead. As the credits say, this was only "suggested" by Isaac Asimov's book. Except the title and the robot laws, it has nothing to do with the collection of stories. Will Smith does his usual "action Will" job here. Funny at times, heroic at others, 'I'm right and everyone else is wrong' most of the time. The effects and overall look of the movie are well done with one caveat: two of the action scenes are so dependent on effects, and don't blend well with the humans in the scene, that you don't believe for one second that it's actually happening. Overall a good sci fi/action flick if you don't think too hard about the story.</p></body></html>

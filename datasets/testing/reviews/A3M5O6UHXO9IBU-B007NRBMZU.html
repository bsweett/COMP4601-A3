<meta name="summary" content="*SPOILER*"></head><body><p>Boasting a similar plot to "Bedazzled", in which Dudley Moore, granted seven wishes by the devil, finds himself tied in ever more fiendish knots as he tries to get closer to the girl of his dreams. He is finally trapped as a nun blowing a perenial rasberry in his own private hell. You may find yourself wanting to blow a similar rasberry in the direction of "Butterfly Effect", a far less entertaining film.<br /><br />Likewise, it is about the hopeless pursuit of a paramour, only the title is a misnomer, being nothing to do with chaos theory. Instead, it is, like "Bedazzled", decidedly non-secular and old-testament in its morality. It is just beyond the balance of probabilities that every outcome would be negative. Thus the cards are stacked in favour of a reactionary message of not defying God's will, rather than the capriciousness of nature, in which they would not. The Christian theme of sacrificing oneself for others in an act of faith and love might be aimed squarely at the bible belt, had it not been for the perverse solution of an abortion which would more likely have fundamentalists frothing at the mouth. Definately one for the "what were they thinking of?" filing cabinet.</p></body></html>

This movie feels a lot different from the original, being a lot darker and having a very `green' tint to much of the movie but perhaps it's due to the cover art and the theatrical posters during the movie's release. This is in my opinion, one of 2003's best movies.<p> In the case of "Reloaded" Neo begins to realize that he has only 3 days to rally up the remaining human population and defend Zion, their last refuge from being taken over by renegade machines being controlled by a renegade program called Agent Smith who has the ability to replicate himself and spread his power all over the Matrix. Time is running out and Neo has only 3 days to save the remainder of humanity from falling prey to the intelligent machines that are run by the replicating renegade program Agent Smith. Accoring to the philosophy, Neo is in fact, Agent Smith's equal that is the `one' who can save humanity from a fate worse than death. For some older audiences, this movie may come close to being something that came from "The Terminator" movie series and yes, I can see a lot of similarities between Matrix and Terminator in terms of man versus machine. <p> This movie is a really excellent follow-up to the 1999 original Matrix movie but there are some areas where it can get a bit out of hand. While many movies seem to suffer from a lack of a good plot or one that never takes off at all, "The Matrix Reloaded" is the opposite where the plot goes way over the top and jumps too much between stories and goes all over the place without allowing some time to rest. In some ways, I feel that "Reloaded" has been rendered almost obsolete because it ends with a cliffhanger note almost abruptly and "Revolutions" is where the real fun begins. That doesn't mean that "Reloaded" is no longer necessary but I feel that they could easily have made "Reloaded" and "Revolutions" into one four hour movie and the final two movies in the Matrix series created more questions than answered others. The one thing that I felt was completely unnecessary was a scene between Neo and Trinity. While I am not bothered that much by such material, I felt the lovemaking scene just cluttered up the film. Sorry, no offense but I felt it cluttered up the film. <p> I know that Keanu Reeves as Neo is the foreground character and he does great in playing Neo but Hugo Weaving who gave us Elrond from Lord of The Rings, steals the spotlight away from everyone else in this film. Upon seeing the scary and unsettling character Agent Smith, I have to say that Weaving can play some REALLY scary bad guys and is totally awesome and engaging in this movie. I could almost forget about everyone else in the movie's cast because Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is one of the most awesome characters in this movie despite the fact that he's the arch villain. <p> The second disc though is a real treat. You can see a lot of footage of how several of the various scenes are created and see the behind the scenes footage of the epic highway chase scenes. You won't believe how they made the highway chase scene. I'm not going to tell you how they did but you will be amazed at how they did it. I was like "WOW!" when I watched the part of filming the epic highway battle scenes. It's absolutely amazing! Then you got a lot of interviews with the actors and seeing how they filmed a lot of the various acting sequences, typical of most DVDs but the "Matrix Reloaded" DVD is definitely one to check out just for disc two. <p> The special effects are absolutely amazing and groundbreaking, even by a lot of today's standards. The various martial combat, fight scenes and chase scenes are incredibly choreographed and tons and tons of fun to watch. I'll admit, the CGI effects can start to get out of hand in some places but for the most part, the visuals are just amazing to watch! I haven't seen special effects that actually were efficiently done so well since Bruce Willis' "The Fifth Element" from seamingly entire lifetimes ago. <p> This movie is no masterpiece by any means, nor surpasses it's original 1999 predecessor and suffers from being a very confusing movie but if you can bypass the flaws, then "Matrix Reloaded" is a must-see movie and worth renting many times over and succeeds in many ways that a lot of sequels fail at: living up the original. I say renting as opposed to buying because I'm just waiting for a possible box set or something like "The Matrix Trilogy" or some box set containing all three movies in one because even though the final movie "Revolutions" left me wanting a lot more, this trilogy was very well done and is a great achievement in Sci-Fi History.<p> The Waschowski Brothers have done a great job of creating an unforgettable movie legacy with these three movies. I give this movie about a Grade A-.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What a Great Film to Start off 2007"></head><body><p>I thought this film looked interesting from the trailers, and it was something to behold when I saw it today. Even the critics can't praise this movie enough.<br /><br />The film is very bleak and actually quite violent at times. Clive Owen and Michael Caine are both fantastic here, as are the many weird characters we meet along the way. The 10 minute action scene towards the end is like something out of Saving Private Ryan, and it is all shot in one take. There is no editing during the action scene as the camera follows Clive Owen around. How did they coordinate all the explosions and extras without saying cut? Freaking amazing! I still can't wait until the highly reviewed Pan's Labyrinth comes to my town, but for now Children of Men reigns supreme.</p></body></html>

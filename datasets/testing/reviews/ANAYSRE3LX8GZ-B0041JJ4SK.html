<meta name="summary" content="You'd have to be stoned to rate it higher"></head><body><p>In the past, "stoner" movies used to be somewhat funny, but this one... I wouldn't even call it a stoner movie, it was about 2 guys who get stoned and decide to go Whitecastle, and on the way, everything goes wrong.<br /><br />I got a few small laughs here and there, but nothing memorable in the end. The only thing I remember about the movie now is Bobby Lee from Mad TV is in it, but that's no reason to watch it.<br /><br />If you wanna watch a stupid movie where after a night out of a couple of baked guys go looking for the munchies and all of a sudden the next day they have enough confidence to stand up for themselves, or ask a chick out at last, then this ones gonna knock your socks off.<br /><br />It is refreshing to not see the Chinese-eyes guy laughing on the sofa watching Ren & Stimpy for a change, but I think I just had my hopes set too high on what I expected from this movie. It had potentiality to do some great comedy moments, but nothing was there. It needed something in it to make it stand out from the others, like if you can't remember the name of a movie, you might say, "oh remember that film where the chick had the sperm in her hair?" or "The movie where the guy bends over and starts talking from his butt?" or "that flick where the guys at the 7-11 pull out the guns on the robbers and tell 'em not to call them Pakistani" ya know, what did this movie have? "oh it's that film that... the two guys get the munchies and.... the party.... ummm.... there car was.... the girl ... the ... screw it, lets watch Cheech & Chong, man"</p></body></html>

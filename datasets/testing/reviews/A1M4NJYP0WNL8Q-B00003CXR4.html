As a Johnny come lately to the world of DVD, and a rare theatergoer, my excuse is that I am simply slow on the uptake.  In addition, I am a bit of a rebel which means that I usually thing that 10 million viewers cant possible be right.  It is also difficult to have something interesting to say when you are the thousandth reviewer.<p>Like just about everyone else, I agree that this is an exceptional film, especially in its genre as a Hong Kong fight film, but also as a piece of filmic art.  Certainly, the cinematography is immaculate.  I felt transported to a magical China.  Whether the scenes are panoramic vistas, visions of life in Chinese towns, or close settings in homes or caves, Ang Lee has spared no effort as being breathtaking and realistic.  While the story is not unique, it is well presented, and the actors quite believable.  It has several layers, the most important being the difficult role of strong women in Chinese culture.  Perhaps the least important being the retrieval of the sword Green Destiny, stolen by young Jen who desperately does not want to become a noble Chinese homemaker, although that is the source of the plot.<p>What makes the film special in its genre is the focus on emotions and personal feelings, rather than fight scenes and bravado.  I'm going to be honest though, this is still a Hong Kong fight film, one where the players pause from the spectacular fight sequences to do some pretty professional emoting.  Good stuff, but don't fall for the hype that makes the film sound like the next Doctor Zhivago.  It is a very strong fight film with surprising depths, but it is not a dramatic masterpiece<p>The thing I liked least was the wirework.  It simply goes too far.  The actors dance across the rooftops like Peter Pan and Wendy, with nary a thump, bonk or rustle.  They never quite touch down and it is rare that someone actually is hit.  Even in anime, where characters float about all the time, a hit is a hit and things bend when you land on them.  It is very hard to take a fight seen seriously when the actors float about like leaves.  One the other hand, the choreography is amazing, and it is surprising that no one ever accidentally does major damage to themselves or someone else.<p>I'm only giving the film a four simply because I disagree with critics like Joe Siegel who declared this 'One of the greatest movies ever made.'  This is hype, and distorts the real values of the film.  It demonstrated that a genre that is rarely treated seriously is capable of being much more than it has been until now.  Hopefully, this trend will continue.</p></body></html>

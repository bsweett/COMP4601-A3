<meta name="summary" content="Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles!!!"></head><body><p>As 2003's Charlize Theron was deserving for her Oscar, Jamie Foxx is deserving as well as for his outstanding portrayal of the musical genious.  Director Taylor Hackford waited 15 years to make this film and it's a good thing he did.  I don't think anyone else could have done a better job in the role.</p></body></html>

While recovering in the hospital, he realizes that he's not in pain and feels much better than he ever did.  The downside to the accident is that it gives him the power to turn into a bulging green giant whenever his angry feelings no longer remain supressed.  For someone not knowing anything about the Hulk, I was quite surprised to find myself enjoying this movie. The only bad thing I have to say about this film with the CGI in this film.  It was awful.</p></body></html>

Well, in 1994, when it was in the theaters, I would not have gone to it without Steve, and he wasn't interested. And we never owned a DVD player. So I've really only had about three years or so to have come across it. Nobody who told me about it told me enough to appreciate that I probably would like it, including that Tom Hanks (the guy from "DaVinci Code," but I didn't know the name then) was someone I would love as a terrific actor. Anymore than I would have believed I'd love Leonardo DiCaprio in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" until I saw him in "Titanic." In fact, he was so convincing in Grape that I thought it really was played by a retarded guy, just like the mother really was played by a morbidly obese woman. I mean, no actor can fake it that well, can they?<br /><br />Apparently some can.<br /><br />Forrest is not seriously retarded, after all, he's just "a little slow," as his mother (Sally Fields) puts it. She's determined to see that he gets the best education possible. Very determined, as the principal of the school finds out. The other thing is he wears braces on his legs. Why? The quack his mother took him to acknowledges there's nothing wrong with his legs, but his back is "as crooked as a question mark." So why do braces on his legs have anything to do with curing his back? We never do find out. But one day when Forrest was being chased by bullies on bicycles, and is running as fast as he can, the braces just break and fall off, and he's running like the wind.<br /><br />Forrest also has a friend, Jenny, the girl who let him sit beside her on the school bus the first day, and they were "like peas and carrots" after that. Always together. He figures she's his girl, but she doesn't quite see it that way. In fact, as they go through life, they keep finding and losing each other.<br /><br />I won't go into all the details, but the basic premise of the story is that Forrest is sitting on a bench waiting for a bus, and gets talking to whomever sits next to him, whether they answer or not. Most of the story is thus told in flashbacks while he tells his experiences in a simple, straightforward way. He's met three presidents, the first one Kennedy as he was on an all-star football team, the second was Johnson as he was awarded the medal of honor for bravery in Vietnam (great story there; I'll let him tell it), and the third was Nixon, because of his central role in the "ping pong diplomacy" with the Chinese.<br /><br />In fact, he seems to always be involved in something which we remember from the news, one way or another. Not for anything he figures is all that special, but just for doing his job or for sheer coincidence. For example, when he meets Nixon, the president asks him how he likes Washington, and does he like his hotel. I don't remember what Forrest answered, but Nixon says he'll be more comfortable in this nice new hotel that only recently opened. That night he's in the Watergate and calls the front desk to report that "they must have had a power out over there because there are people walking around with flashlights and everything." Next thing you know, Nixon is resigning.<br /><br />He makes friends here and there, and these people keep popping up in his life in unexpected ways. Still, coincidence is never strained too far, because Forrest has gotten famous, so people who want to can find him.<br /><br />There's a lot of humor, and a lot of pathos, and they are mixed together just right. You won't pity Forrest, but you will learn to see the world through his eyes to an extent you would not have thought possible when the movie began. It's artfully done, and I'm not at all surprised that it earned six Oscars, including best picture. It's one of the best I've ever seen.</p></body></html>

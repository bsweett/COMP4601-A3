<meta name="summary" content="del toro's second best film (in my opinion)"></head><body><p>Having just seen 'the devils backbone' there were several moments of deja vu for me watching 'pan's labryinth'.. but this is not to say i was in any way dissapointed.. The plot of the movie is in way about the imagination and how it is in some cases a salvation from the extremes that existence can put one through (particularly in times of war).. but it is also about much more. this combination of fantasy and reality is familiar to all of the director work thus far.. he is clearly one of the most talented artists working today.. The cinematographic elements in this movie are very fine tuned - it is gorgeous to look at.. I am deeply impressed with the artistic nature of this work and have high hopes for subsequent projects del toro might endeavor... I do not understand the impatience that most americans have for watching subtitled films.. about half the movies i watch are foreign language films.. If we truly live in a global community then why don't we act like it?</p></body></html>

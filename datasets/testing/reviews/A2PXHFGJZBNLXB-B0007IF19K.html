<meta name="summary" content="Made me a believer of Ray Charles and of Jamie Foxx"></head><body><p>The most heartfelt compliment I can give to Taylor Hackford's RAY is that it inspired me to seek out more of Ray Charles' music, and thus discover what a truly great and inspiring musician he was. You can only have the greatest respect for a man who dealt with his blindness and a childhood tragedy (the drowning death of his kid brother) by making great music and revolutionizing the sound of R&B in the process (his mixing of R&B with gospel sounds was scandalous at the time). And what versatility!---from early original hits like "I've Got a Woman" and "What I'd Say," he eventually put his brilliant interpretive stamp on country music, which is where his classic rendition of "Georgia on my Mind" comes from. But, above all, Ray Charles' soulful voice was his calling card; very few musicians feel the words he sings quite the way Brother Ray did.<br /><br />All of this comes through brilliantly in RAY, as does Charles' manipulative dark side: he ruthlessly switched labels when one couldn't match another's offer, and he had a tendency to coldly cast off friends as quickly as he made them. "Music is a business, baby," Ray (Jamie Foxx) says in the movie, and he certainly treated it that way. And of course there was his drug addiction, which he eventually kicked cold turkey.<br /><br />The achievement of RAY is that both Hackford and its star, Jamie Foxx, do not shy away from Ray Charles' less savory characteristics, but nevertheless do a good job of depicting the man and the impact he had on music. The only major flaw of the film is that at times it lapses into biopic cliches---especially the ending, which throws in a silly dream sequence that suggests that, only after he was able to move on from the terrible memory of his brother's drowning death was he able to cast off his demons, an explanation that, as most biopic explanations tend to be, seems much too pat. But what RAY gets right---how well it explains what a major impact his music had---is what makes this a cherishable movie.<br /><br />Among its other achievements, RAY has also made me a believer of Jamie Foxx. Anyone who can pull off such a stunning portrayal of such a musical giant, and do it without a hint of vanity, deserves all the respect he gets. Foxx's performance is not so much an imitation as it is an inhabitation: he gets Ray's famous physical mannerisms right, but he also paints Ray as a flawed but spirited individual who, despite his attitude toward women and the business side of music, loved to perform and loved to live. As you watch the film, you barely feel Foxx there; he is so immersed in Ray Charles that he almost becomes the man (at least, until that silly concluding dream sequence, in which he has to take off his sunglasses and open his eyes). 2004 really was Foxx's year: he not only did justice to Ray Charles; he also nearly acted poor hard-working Tom Cruise off the screen in Michael Mann's COLLATERAL. He now has an Oscar to show for it, and one that is well-deserved.<br /><br />RAY is not a great movie, but its good points far outweigh its lapses into conventional moralizing. Such a seminal musician as Ray Charles deserves a movie that touches at the heart of why he was so special, and RAY, more often than not, does that admirably. Recommended.</p></body></html>

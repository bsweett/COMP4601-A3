It's the story of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and his brothers, especially focusing around Tombstone and its aftermath. Kurt Russell plays Wyatt Earp, Val Kilmer plays Doc Holliday, Sam Elliott plays Virgil Earp, Bill Paxton plays Morgan Earp, Powers Boothe plays Curly Bill, Michael Biehn plays Johnny Ringo, Jason Priestley plays Deputy Billy Breckinridge, Stephen Lang plays Ike Clanton, Thomas Haden Church plays Billy Clanton, Dana Delany plays Josephine Marcus, Billy Zane plays Fabian--all play their roles brilliantly. Charleton Heston, Billy Bob Thornton Wyatt Earp III, and Micheal Rooker have cameos and Robert Mitchum narrates. I mean with a cast like that how can you go wrong. The story is great, the cinematography is great, the writing is great, and the production value is great. You cannot go wrong with this film. And the dvd is a 2 disc set, packaged very nicely in a slipcover case with a map of Tombstone. It contains a commentary track, a three part making of featurette, a 'tombstone timeline', the OK Corral storyboard sequence, Faro for the computer, and other extras. It's a great movie and a great value for the dvd package.</p></body></html>

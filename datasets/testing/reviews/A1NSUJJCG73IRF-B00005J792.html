<meta name="summary" content="Unbreakable  (2000)"></head><body><p>Director:  M. Night Shyamalan<br /><br />Cast:  Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright Penn, Spencer Treat Clark, Charlayne Woodard, Eamonn Walker, Leslie Stefanson, Johny Hiram Jamison, Michaelia Carroll.<br /><br />Running Time:  106 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements including some disturbing violent content, and for a crude sexual reference.<br /><br />M Night Shyamalan's eagerly awaited follow-up to the astonishing, genre-defining "The Sixth Sense" may not hit the heady heights of its predecessor, but it is still an intriguing film.  Bruce Willis (returning with Shyamalan after his stunning performance in "The Sixth Sense") is American everyman David Dunn. His marriage has fallen apart and he finds it hard to relate to his young son. After years as a security guard at the local football stadium, he goes to New York for a job interview. On the journey home, the train crashes at high speed. Dunn is the only survivor and emerges from the wreckage completely unscathed and something of a media celebrity.  His story is followed closely by local comic book enthusiast Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), an unhinged loner with a rare genetic disorder that makes him prone to broken bones. Price becomes convinced that Dunn is some kind of super-human, immune to pain or injury, and constantly pesters him about his history and lifestyle. It suddenly dawns on Dunn that he has never had a sick day or been injured in any way his whole life. He also has an uncanny knack of spotting potential trouble-makers and ne'er-do-wells at the football stadium. Price claims his choice of profession was borne of a subconscious desire to protect people and urges him to harness his powers in the conquest of evil, but Dunn is a reluctant superman. Despite an improvement in his relationship with his son (who is thrilled to have a comic book hero for a Dad) he remains unconvinced he is anything other than normal man (albeit a thick-skinned one).<br /><br />Obsessive comic book fans will probably not like the performance of a big wigged Jackson, wide-eyed stare and grandiose dialogue. Willis does his whispering trick again like he did in "The Sixth Sense" and sadly can't portray the emotional turmoil needed for a character like David. Much better are Clark and Penn as David's son and wife, both of whom find themselves questioning David as much as themselves,the atmosphere and tension are built up well and the obligatory twist at the end is well written and well disguised.  "Unbreakable" never fully hits its stride until the end but when it does, it proves to be a tense thriller full of the quasi-supernatural imagery that Shyamalan loves.  Not up to par with "Signs" or "The Sixth Sense", but certainly worth the gander.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great film, worthy of its praise"></head><body><p>What makes One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest one of the more amazing adaptations from book to film is the superb acting and the flawless job casting the roles. Having Jack Nicholson take on the role of McMurphy, a man who tries to get out his prison term by faking being crazy, was a brilliant move, as he epitomizes the snide, sarcastic, rebellious character. Also, there are exceptional jobs done by both Brad Doriff as Billie, one of the patients in the asylum, and Louise Fletcher as the soft spoken, but superior Nurse Ratched, who butts head with McMurphy. The film also features many well-known names and faces: Danny DeVito in his film debut, Christopher Lloyd, Will Sampson (as "Chief").<br /><br />The film's main theme is antiestablishment and rebellion over authority, but still there is a human side to all of the mischeviousness. McMurphy realizes almost immediately after getting to the institution that things won't go as merrily and easy as he had planned, but is confident that he will break Nurse Ratched's will within a week, so much so that he offers a wager with some of the patients. McMurphy tries to rally the boys to have special privileges and to do things like watch the world series, and the crux of the film is about this battle between individual and authority. Along the way, he meets and gets to know many of the wards, and sees their problems up close. He befriends a silent, towering Native American man, Chief, who becomes an important character in the film's final resolution.<br />The film also explores what it means to be "free." Many of the wards, McMurphy comes to find out, do not have to be in the institution, but are there voluntarily, perhaps so they don't have to face the outside world. McMurphy's sense of freedom--which is to do and say whatever he wants-- is constantly being impeded and prevented by Nurse Ratched. In a critical point in the film, the Chief sees this freedom being crushed, and must decide what to do.<br /><br />I loved the two disc set, which also offers a documentary that looks at the making of the film, so this definitely is the one to get (I mention this because Amazon lumps all versions of the film together in one review).<br /><br />I remember seeing this movie back in a film studies class, and it was fantastic to watch it again. It has humor and wit, but also pathos and tragedy. It is a great film, and worthy of the many accolades it took home that year.</p></body></html>

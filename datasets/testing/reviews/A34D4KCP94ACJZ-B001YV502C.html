<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film of 2006"></head><body><p>Children of Men gives us yet another brilliant cinematic dystopian experience in the tradition of great films like A Clockwork Orange, Logan's Run, The Terminator, 1984 and Bladerunner.  It makes a web of appropriate, contemporary and significant social insights, while at the same time it gives us hopeful storytelling about the fall and possible triumph of humankind.<br /><br />The story is set in the year 2027, which is closer than one may think and seems to follow a time period of immense global change.  Make no mistake about it, in order for things to end up the way they do in the year 2027 here in Children of Men, we will have to endure some really horrendous ordeals in pretty much the next two or three years.  This includes a flu pandemic, some kind of nuclear conflict, large scale societal and cultural breakdown, terrorism, the collapse of all governments outside of England and of course, the most significant feature, the complete infertility of all female humans on Earth since the year 2009.  Despair is all that exists in this world but despair is not what this story is about.  Children of Men is a story about hope.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n directs; one of my personal favorite filmmakers for Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n.  The story is inspired by P.D. James' novel of the same name.  Cuar&oacute;n's take is actually quite consistent with Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n in that it is a road movie about the primary character's self-discovery and makes some really insightful social commentary.  The movie opens by informing us of the unexpected death of "baby Diego", the youngest human being on Earth.  We then follow Theo Faron (Clive Owen) who is an unlikely hero in complete despair.  He is a flawed drunk who smokes and when asked about his smoking he replies "it's not working", implying that he just doesn't care to live.  Then again, in this setting, who really does?  The human race will be extinct in less than 100 years.  Children of Men could've benefited from less detailed advertising as I almost wished I didn't know that Theo's transformation from despair to hope would be because of an African refugee Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), who is the first pregnant woman on Earth in 18 years.  That isn't to say the film did not surprise me time and time again.  It certainly did.  I didn't know much about Children of Men going into it and I think knowing less is better for the audience here more so than many films, so I will spoil no more than I have already.<br /><br />There are two things that make this movie amazing, beyond the fundamental strengths of it's story and overall direction.  The first point I'd like to mention is with regards to the performances.  Each actor melts into their roles brilliantly.  Obviously we expect this from Julianne Moore and Michael Caine but we get some great performances from the newcomers as well.  Even the small supporting roles are great.  But most of all, Clive Owen has truly arrived here.  He actually helped write for his own character and his passion for the role really shows.  I'm actually surprised he wasn't considered for an Oscar.  It's often easy to say that the character's writing itself is what pulls forth a great performance from the actor, but the fact that Clive assisted in writing the character into the screenplay, and then blew me away with his performance is remarkable to say the least.  The other big strength for me is the modern political flavor.  The film functions as a loose deliberation of sorts on our current global political climate, and it offers us some potentially dire consequences.  It's elaborate to decipher where Cuar&oacute;n's convictions lie, but it's certainly worth joining in on his insights regardless of where you, the viewer, stand.<br /><br />Keep in mind, Cuar&oacute;n does not care to offer us a back story like most movies do and the casual viewer may be frustrated with some key questions.  It's not a typical action film narrative and the audience is expected to draw some of their own conclusions or even accept that we just don't have the answers at all.  Of course that mirrors real life and for me it's challenging questions that make a movie great.</p></body></html>

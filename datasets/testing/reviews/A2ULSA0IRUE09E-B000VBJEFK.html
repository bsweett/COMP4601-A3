<meta name="summary" content="Pixar's Defining Moment on Film"></head><body><p>A rat that wants to be a chef. He lives in rural France, and finds himself in Paris. Soon, he is helping a young restaurant apprentice make his name as the Greatest Chef in France. While the story is a bit unbelievable (its a cartoon after all!), the execution is brilliant.<br /><br />You would never want to find a rat in your kitchen - after watching this, you really start being more sensitive to the feelings of these gentle beasts. Yes, they ARE hungry monsters, but they are quite cute while they're at it. Even if you're not a food lover or a rat lover, chances are you will be charmed by this highly imaginative and creative film.<br /><br />Five Stars for the movie, and the glorious French title song.</p></body></html>

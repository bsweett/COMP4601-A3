I must admit that while I'm a Harry Potter fan, I'm not quite a Harry Potter fanboy. I read the first five books and enjoyed them immensely, but didn't read the last two. It's no fault of the series that I neglected to do so, merely my lack of drive to do so. I have seen all six of the previous films, each in the year of their release and only once. I know that Harry Potter fans can be hard to please, especially when it comes to Hollywood adapting their sacred text. It seems no matter how faithful the screenwriters stick to the story, there is always room for error here. With that in mind, I am only at liberty to discuss this as a standalone film; not bothering to compare it to the previous films nor discuss how it differs from the novels. What I can tell you, and it should come as no surprise, is that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 functions as a film in context with the other books/movies. If you have not seen any of the previous films, don't bother seeing this one. If you've skipped a couple films or a couple books, but are familiar enough with the ones you've skipped, you may find this film mostly enjoyable...But I recommend having as much knowledge as possible before watching this; I admit even I was unable to catch a few references throughout.<br /><br />In describing the plot, not that the plot or anyone involved in it need introduction, I'll be careful not to offend the spoiler police. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is gaining power throughout the Wizarding and Muggle worlds, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is in far greater danger than he ever imagined. With Voldemort in constant pursuit of him, Harry and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must locate the remaining Horcruxes (powerful objects in which Voldemort has hidden fragments of his soul) in order to eventually destroy the Dark Lord.<br /><br />The excitement level of this entry rarely lets up and the film is very fast paced, but what's remarkable is that there's an actual plot behind the action and part one isn't just an introduction to the epic battle that will likely take place in part two. While most Hollywood productions begin to drone on and get lazy by the second installment (sometimes after a lazy first installment), the Harry Potter films, seven films in, continues to thrive and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 may be one of the strongest entries in the series. I can say without a doubt that it's better than the sixth film.<br /><br />This film is such a strong entry in part because it works on levels of story, adventure, character, and plot. I initially found the decision to split the book into two films a way for the studio to milk this franchise for every last dime, but I concede that this was a great idea. It allows the filmmakers to finish this tale without sacrificing any of the necessary elements that have made people embrace these films. Here is a film, a Hollywood blockbuster no less that moves at a fast-pace yet continues to move, un-rushed, through the plot and develop its characters further. I think it's hard to deny the effect of a film when it elicits sympathy over an elf. Yes, for a movie about witchcraft and wizardry, there's a surprising amount of effective emotional cues throughout.<br /><br />All of the actors who have worked tirelessly for the last decade have really blossomed in their roles, particularly the three leads: Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson. They've grown into these characters and are completely convincing. Any doubt about their casting should be brushed away if it hasn't been already. Fiennes' performance as Voldemort is a particularly impressive feat, especially when one considers that the wrong actor could come off as completely ridiculous in this role. There's a lot of makeup and CGI involved in the physical creation of Voldemort and yet Fiennes makes him wholly believable and appropriately menacing. His performance is wonderfully realized, as Voldemort does come off as an incarnation of evil without becoming a computer-generated joke. Fiennes also adds a certain amount of pathos that I think few actors could muster. In addition, the actors all share a chemistry and on-screen bond that can only be acquired from knowing and working with their group for many years. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have been playing best friends for ten years and they're a believable group. Most of the 145 minutes of part one focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione's quest to find the Horcrux, leaving little room for other actors to really strut their stuff; but Alan Rickman (as Snape) continues to stand out as memorable, even with little screentime. Meanwhile, Dobby (played, in voice, by Toby Jones), the memorable house-elf, is adorable, making for effective comedic relief and lending the film one of its most surprisingly emotional moments.<br /><br />In addition to these various elements related to story, one can't ignore the high production value of this film. Yes, it has plenty of CGI (lending perfectly to the mystical aspect of the series), but it's also beautifully rendered with the world of the books lovingly recreated. Ten people are credited with various aspects of set design, production design, and art direction and their efforts set the movie-world of Harry Potter apart from everything else. Meanwhile, the cinematography by Eduardo Serra looks absolutely majestic.<br /><br />The Harry Potter films rarely get enough credit. Despite being extremely well-made, high-grossing films based on a beloved series of novels they're mostly grouped into the category of simple Hollywood blockbusters. While the previous entries in the series only exist in my mind as vague memories, I can say from this film and those small recollections of the previous films that these are high-quality films that deserve more attention than they've received. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a fine film; an emotional, entertaining, and all-around terrific set-up for part two. It's a film that long-time fans of Harry Potter will not want to miss and new fans will want to get through the others to watch as soon as possible. It's worth the wait.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

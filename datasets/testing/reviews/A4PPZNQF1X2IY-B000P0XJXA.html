<meta name="summary" content="Ignore some bad reviews, see the movie"></head><body><p>A fine film by David Mamet, who is producing one of the best bodies of work of his generation.  He has his own stylistic way<br /><br />of writing, which some people may not like, because it is very direct, vulgar/curt, and sometimes macho or seemlingly chauvinistic.  I'm not a person who normally enjoys such dialogue, but Mamet creates his own genre, which gains merit<br /><br />because of it's underlying intelligence and drama.  This movie is a fast paced, intelligent thriller, that is tied together well, and that has soul.  As any conspiracy thriller, one maybe has to indulge the plot a little, but saying it has holes is an overstatement.  Kilmer and many of the interesting side characters give firm performances, and the movie is filled with edgy one-liners.  This is not a family movie, but under the tough veneer is a message about honor and dignity... and probably redemption.  As a footnote, the commentary by Kilmer (I listened to the last half hour only) is trippy and humorous.</p></body></html>

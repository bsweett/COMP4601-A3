<meta name="summary" content="very much the better of the two"></head><body><p>As most series go, the second is usually better than the first, and 28 Weeks Later... is no exception. The rage virus is out and about again, but this time the main character is a 12-year old kid, not a middle-aged man (although he does play a big role in this movie also). Opening up with a flashback scene from 28 Days Later, this wild little thrill ride doesn't let up for the rest of the movie. Very good and gets my highest horror recommendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="4 1/2 stars for an intriguing look at our relgious "foundations""></head><body><p>Whether or not you believe in Dan Brown's mixture of historical facts mixed with a blend of hypotheses and extrapolations all bound up in a grand symbological mutli-million unit selling mystery novel(released in 2003)or not,is really of no consequence.The Roman Catholic Church whose foundation his novel questions was none too pleased at the time and(typical of the Church)issued memos to its' flock not to either read the book nor attend the subsequent movie's release.Of course,according to the Church,it was all bogus from beginning to end.Me thinks they did protest too much!<br />The movie takes Brown's writings and brings them to the screen in an intelligent and attractive manner all served up(and there is ALOT to serve up!)in a fast paced and unrelenting style that keeps you glued to the screen from the beginning to the very end.<br />The Da Vinci Code(released May/06) involves the story of a symbologist/cryptonalyst by the name of Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks).He is giving a lecture in Paris and attends a book signing after when he is approached by the police,one Capt.Fache(Jean Reno),to assist them in a murder that has just been committed in the Louvre.It turns out to be a friend of Langdon's by the name of Sauniere and the body has many mysterious symbols about it.Landon doesn't know it but the police captain suspects him of doing the dirty deed.A police cryptologist Sophie Neveu(Audrey Tautou)arrives and gets Langdon alone.He is in danger she says and must leave and moreover the man who was murdered was her grandfather.<br />They escape and head to a bank with a key her grandfather left to her.It is a key to a safety deposit box which contains a small wooden box,in which is a cryptex.It is a cylindrical container surrounded with letters that must be arranged in a certain way to open it successfully.If not done properly a vial inside releases a potion of vinegar which destroys the contents.From here the pair seek out a Holy Grail expert-friend of Langdon's ,a Mr Teabing(Ian McKellan).They discuss the ins and outs of the Grail and the Church's earliest days and beginnings,right back to Christ himself and whether he was supernatural or just a man,when the police track them down.They all escape to London with the French police captain still in pursuit.<br />In London Langdon(assisted throughout by Neveu) tracks down an important clue to locate the Grail but they are confronted by Teabing who wants the box and cryptex it contains.Langdon turns away to try and decode the cryptex but when he turns back he throws it into the air which cracks the inner vile and destroys the contents.At this moment the police enter and Teabing is arrested,not Landon nor Neveu.It seems the French captain has been played for a dupe by the dark shadows of the Church who also want the Grail's location and he has come to his senses.Well,it turns out Langdon did indeed crack the code and has the parchment paper from inside.In it the directions lead them both to a Church in the countryside of England where they find that the Grail they seek was indeed once there but has been moved.However they also find the guardians of the Grail,a group dedicated to preserving the Grail and its' location.We also find out the Grail was/is Neveu herself;as she is from a royal blood line descended from Christ himself through Mary Magdeline his wife.The movie ends with much of the clues that have inundated Langdon's mind throughout his arduous journey,coming together and him walking to the front of the Louvre museum in Paris and kneeling and praying over the spot where the bodily remains of Mary Magdeline secretly lay.<br />The movie moves along at breakneck speed and  makes brief stops for the viewers to catch their collective breaths and try and take in much of what is going on before them.There are alot of clues and alot of information to digest here.But in the end the ultimate conflict here is again wrapped around a good guys-bad guys scenario.On the bad guy side is the Opus Dei depicted here as a shadowy form of the Vatican that is trying to keep hidden and even search out and destroy any vestige or hint of the Grail,i.e. the remains of Mary Magdeline and a possible bloodline.On the good side we have the keepers of the faith with the Priory of Scion and their more well known arm the Knights Templar.These guardians(and their many descendants)have fought the good fight for centuries in order to keep the truth alive,but hidden from harms way,i.e the Vatican.Brown's novel and the resultant movie never preach their story to us and let us make our own minds up.As I said before this story is based on old historical fact mixed with legends and the resultant extrapolations of the two.Near the end of the movie a conversation between Langdon and Neveu really says it all about the novel,movie and their goal.Langdon asks Neveu would revealing herself as a direct descendant of Christ bring about destruction of the Church or a new reconnaissance of it? Intriguing question to an intriguing....theory? Open minds is what it is all about.<br />This movie is one of Ron Howard's better efforts and deserves high praise for his deft handling of the complex material.The movie contains a solid roster of actors from Hanks,McKellan to French star Jean Reno and Germany's Jurgen Prochnow.Paul Bettany as Silas does a great turn as a conflicted and tortured puppet of the Opus Dei's bidding.<br />Technically the movie is presented in its original 2:40:1 aspect ratio and has been transferred wonderfully,sound included.Extras abound in this two disc set.We have featurettes "Filmmakers Journey Pt's 1 & 2",Music of the DC",a DC demo DVD game,"Portrait of Langdon","Who is Sophie Neveu?","The Usual Suspects","Magical Places","Close up of the Mona Lisa",a discussion with Dan Brown,first day on the set with the director and a look at many of the hidden codes placed smartly throughout the film itself.Everything you wanted to know about the DC but hadn't even thought to ask!<br />All in all a well done and intriguing thriller/novel brought deftly to the big screen by Ron Howard and now to DVD,in a fast 141 minutes.It's a solid cast and a highly recommended film worthy of repeated viewings to catch many of the clues that you may have missed the first time.Enjoy.</p></body></html>

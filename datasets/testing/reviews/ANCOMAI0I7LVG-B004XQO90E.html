Maybe that is why I liked this so much, or maybe it is because the film is actually really good; I'm still not entirely sure.  It looked really stupid, some sort of action packed `Groundhog Day' and I'm still not sold on the idea of Jake Gyllenhaal being a good actor (his sister on the other hand is tremendous) so I remember seeing the trailer for this and thinking "no need to see that" but then the reviews rolled in and word of mouth was good and so, with nothing better to do, the wife and I settled in for a watch.<br /><br />The basic premise is that Jake Gyllenhaal is a bomber pilot named Colter Stevens who has been recruited for a special mission where he relives the last 8 minutes of a terrorist attack victim's life in order to uncover who the terrorist was and how to prevent it from happening again.  He lives out those 8 minutes and then dies only to be rebooted back at the same spot to relive it again in an attempt to uncover as much information as he can so that they can save as many people as possible.  Once in his new body, Colter forms a quick friendship with Christina, a young woman accompanying his host, but his desire to help himself out of the situation and write his own fate (or be a bigger hero) begins to fray the edges of his mission.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal carries the film very well, but the entire cast is solid here.  Monaghan is a beauty (stunning, really) and she flirts in all the right angles.  Jeffrey Wright is perfectly creepy in his mysterious role, and Michael Arden slays his character's reveal.  It is Vera Farmiga though who once again solidifies her current status in Hollywood.  I just love this woman!<br /><br />`Source Code' is fast paced and exciting and uses its premise in a way that really works.  It also sets itself up for a sequel, one that I'll be anxious to see...so here's to hoping they don't botch that one up!</p></body></html>

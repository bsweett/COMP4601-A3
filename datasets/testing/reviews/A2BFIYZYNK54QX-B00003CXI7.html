<meta name="summary" content="The Worst Film of the Year!"></head><body><p>Okay, imagine an episode of Tales From The Crypt (whose television program was actually co-created by this film's director Robert Zemeckis) with a good cast, a good budget, a good director, and one of the more interesting premises of a film this year. Now imagine the worst script possible being attached to it, and there you have &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, easily the worst film of 2000 because of its sheer, transparent joy in dumbing itself down from what could have been a shocking, disturbing, multi-leveled thriller to a crowd-pleasing mish-mash of Hitchcockian cliches, over-the-top performances, and an ending that goes on about twenty minutes too long. What is wrong with Robert Zemeckis? He who was the mastermind behind such truly great films like &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and the executive producer of one of the most underrated films of the 90's, Peter Jackson's &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, brings us this film which seems to have consciously made an effort to make itself stupid. Of course, Zemeckis has had his share of misfires such as &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; and the abysmal sequels to &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, but after his superb direction in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and his support of &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, I was hoping that those days were over. But I was wrong. Now onto the movie itself. Its plot is very strong: A happily-married couple (Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfieffer) who finally have some time to rekindle the flames of their romance after sending their daughter off to college, find that their beautiful new colonial house... is haunted. And it just so happens to be haunted by the ghost of a young college girl who Ford's character, a brilliant college science professor, had an affair with. Makes for a pretty strong ghost story, right? Wrong. Merely because the film tries too hard to make the events of the physical world responsible for the terror that the spiritual world brings into it. Whatever happened to ghost stories that happened seemingly for no reason? Doesn't that make things scarier and more immediate when terrible things happen to good people without justification? Apparently, Zemeckis and Co. didn't think so. So we have one climax followed by another and another and another and another until we finally get to the real one that not only is embarassingly absurd, but gives no real satisfaction. You're left feeling empty and insulted because where the film could have disturbed and shocked in an intelligent manner, it went for the cheap Hollywood ending that wraps everything up in a neat little package so you can walk out of the theater feeling good that the evil-doer is punished and the innocent walk free. Didn't Hollywood learn anything from great shockers like &quot;The Exorcist&quot; or &quot;Se7en&quot; or &quot;Psycho&quot;? That you can make a disturbing and smart thriller without everything having to happen for a reason? I guess not, which is maybe one of the reasons that 2000 was one of the worst years of filmmaking ever.</p></body></html>

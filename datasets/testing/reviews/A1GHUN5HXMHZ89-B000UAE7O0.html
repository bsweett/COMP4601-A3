No, but it sure feels like it. It has the look and feel of one of the double feature B movies we saw back then. I applaud the production, directing, casting, editing, and camera work. All went into making it look and feel older. The cast does a fine job with their parts and add to the illusion of an older B movie, but with some satire that let's us smile along with them as we know they aren't really serious when in the older movies they were funny unintentionally and they were serious about it. I really enjoyed the characters in this movie and it kept my interest the whole time. Well worth at least a rental and I think this one is a keeper and the price makes it a steal. It has some great acting, effects, and the story is just plain fun. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Sin City" and "Kill Bill". - C. Luster</p></body></html>

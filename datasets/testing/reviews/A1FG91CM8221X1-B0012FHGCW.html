<meta name="summary" content="A moving, tragic story about an American adventure."></head><body><p>I'm probably in the minority in having gone to see Sean Penn's film version of "Into the Wild" without having first read Jon Krakauer's book. The movie has met my most stringent test: it made me want to go out and buy the book immediately. I had always thought of Chris McCandless as some sort of suicidal fool, but Penn opened my eyes to another, completely different interpretation: that McCandless was in the great tradition of American wanderers, from Daniel Boone forward, who sought distant horizons and a more intense, more direct engagement with nature and life. We're used to hearing the success stories in wilderness adventure; McCandless' story, alas, ended tragically, through a series of misfortunes and miscalculations such as (at least according to Penn) could have befallen most people in the same situation. But, as Penn shows us, McCandless' two years of wanderings across America before meeting his end in the Alaskan wilderness were quite a ride. Working from his own screenplay and with the aid of the brilliant photographer Eric Gautier, Penn presents McCandless as an intelligent, educated young man who sought escape for the usual reasons: an unhappy home life and a general disgust with the materialism of American life, particularly as represented by his family. McCandless' experiences on the way to Alaska, and the people he meets along the way, lead him finally (again, at least according to Penn) to the revelation that happiness is not a solitary emotion; it must be shared. Unfortunately, he comes to that conclusion too late. I can't help but wish that, before his journey, McCandless could have met John Haines and had the benefit of his advice. Haines, another educated young man who went to roughly the same part of Alaska as McCandless and homesteaded there successfully for the better part of 40 years, in the meantime writing some of the best American poetry of the latter half of the 20th century. (At the time McCandless left for Alaska, Haines was teaching in the Jenny McKean Moore program at George Washington University; I was one of his students there.) However much Penn's movie diverges from Krakauer's book or the reality of McCandless' life, there's no question his movie is a powerful experience, enhanced by the honest, thoughtful and emotionally direct performance of Emile Hirsch as McCandless. The supporting cast is also noteworthy, including William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Jena Malone as McCandless' family and Brian Dierker, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and Kristen Stewart as folks McCandless meets in his travels. The best supporting performance is by Hal Holbrook--these days looking more like T.S. Eliot than Mark Twain--as an elderly desert-dweller who takes a grandfatherly interest in McCandless.</p></body></html>

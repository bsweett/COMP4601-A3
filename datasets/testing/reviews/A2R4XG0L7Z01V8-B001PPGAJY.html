Once you've seen the first, you will definitely want to see the second, especially since you get to see even more of the rather lovely Hugh Jackman.<p>All the old characters are brought back to fight another day, and we also get introduced to some new characters - some of the kids from the school get a bigger role, including Rogue's boyfriend, who will make sure that your drink is always `ice' cold. Another great new character is "Nightcrawler", played brilliantly by fellow Scot, Alan Cumming, who is almost as bad as Mystique, having at one point to be in make-up for 10 hours! (He appears topless in one scene, so that adds on the extra hours)<p>All the now well known characters appear at the start, but they don't all appear at the end. Now, I wonder what that could mean? I was quite shocked at the apparent death of this particular popular character, as it seemed totally unnecessary, but never mind. <p>Hugh Jackman is terrific once more as Wolverine, although he meets the female version of him, resulting in some rather painful looking scenes. There are also a few glimpses into his past, and it gets revealed about how he came to be as he is. <p>Anna Paquin appears, and gets a quite good role, although the originally `white' streaks in her hair seem to have turned blonde between films! Her relationship with her `ice cool' boyfriend, briefly introduced during the previous film, develops, although not by much, judging by the effect she has on people! <p>In this film, the humans are the baddies, and the renegade mutants join with the good guys to fight the threat. This results in some spectacular action scenes with explosive special effects.<p>There are a huge amount of extras on the two disc dvd version, covering almost everything you could possibly want to know about the making of this film, from pre-production to post-production, including the special make-up effects used on Nightcrawler and Mystique.<p>The four-disc special edition DVD containing both films and stacks of extras is highly recommended and well-worth the purchase price.</p></body></html>

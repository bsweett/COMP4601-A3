<meta name="summary" content="Remake"></head><body><p>This is a remake of one of, if not thee most succesfull independant films of all time. It's all hype; Rob Zombie is a bad director. I would rate it higher but it's very unoriginal and not scary. This is like a parody of Halloween and it's own cliches. Worth a rental though just to see a little something.</p></body></html>

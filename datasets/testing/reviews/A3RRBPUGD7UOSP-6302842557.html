<meta name="summary" content="I loved everything about this film"></head><body><p>This is one of those films that has everything, humor, drama, suspense, and of course, music. Tons of music. I think the acting in the movie would have made it enjoyable, even without as much music as it had. Of course, being that Mozart and his nemesis Salieri are the main characters, music could never be omitted.<p>In the film, F. Murray Abraham portrays Salieri, court conductor and playwrite. A young prodigy, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart comes along and steals his thunder with some of the most beautiful, and unusual music written to date.<p>Salieri decides to torpedo Mozart and pretends to befriend him, all the while stabbing him in the back at every turn. The interraction between the two actors is fabulous.<p>This is one of those films that I could watch repeatedly. If you decide to buy it, get the director's cut 2-Disc set. It wasn't available when I bought the movie. This standard version is pretty basic, with not much other than the movie on it. Because I'm a fan of extra features, I'll probably buy it as well.</p></body></html>

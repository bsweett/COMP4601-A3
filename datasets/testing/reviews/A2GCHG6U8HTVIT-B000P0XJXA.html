<meta name="summary" content="A Disappointment For This Mamet Fan"></head><body><p>I like David Mamet a lot, but this one was a disappointment for me. There seemed to be two movies, the first in the U.S. to find a kidnapped girl. This is treated with intensity and action. Then, whoops, the twist and we're off to Dubai to fight kidnapping for prostitution and ruthlessness in high places, and we're again treated to intensity and action. The main guy is played by Val Kilmer as one of these humorless Hollywood heroes for whom there is no obstacle which can't be overcome and whose backstory, as they say, has hidden depths of tragedy and alienation. Mamet insures that we see the guy's back without his shirt on and it's not a pretty sight. We learn nefarious things are going on with the big man's staff (the big man is, I assume, the President and the girl's father; she's been kidnapped) and then all of a sudden William Macy takes center stage for the last ten minutes with almost no preparation. //Spoiler alert// Our hero, of course, is a loner -- which is a sure tip-off that anyone he sort of becomes close to is going to get killed. They do. Surprisingly for a Mamet film, there's not a single actor, in my opinion, who brought much interest to a part. However, one thing I liked about the movie and other Mamet films is that he doesn't explain the obvious, so you have to stay alert.<br /><br />But having said all this, some film critics I like have written good reviews of the movie.<br /><br />If you're interested in Mamet , take a look at The Spanish Prisoner and Heist.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the greatest horror movie of our time"></head><body><p>when i first saw The Exorcist, i was scared beyond belief. i was so terrified i slept with my parents cause everytime i closed my eyes i would see the horrible things from the movie. in fact i almost have to force myself to watch it becuase its so scary. so what is it that makes The Exorcist so scary? its because of the images it shows you that disturbs you so deeply. even today, The Exorcist has been called the scariest movie ever made and one of the greatest american films ever and it lives up to that excpectation. when it was realesed in theaters back in 73, it caused mass histaria. people fainted, screamed, ran out of the theater, and some even suffered heart attacks with paramedics being rushed to the theater making it one of the most controversial films ever. the film tells of an actress who calls upon two priest to save her daughter who is possessed by the devil. every performance in this film is flawless but the true star is Linda Blair as the possessed girl, she brought so much force to a demanding role and she did it so well she has made Regan McNeal one of the biggest baddies in history. i also think she would have won the oscar had she not been competing against Tatum O'Neal and that whole controversy over the actress who did the demon voice. Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller also give some great performances to boast this film that if it wasent up against The Sting it definantly would have won the oscar for best picture. The Exorcist is one of my all time favorite films and i have recomended it to everyone who hasent seen it. so if you want to be scared out of your pants, see the film that is The Exorcist.</p></body></html>

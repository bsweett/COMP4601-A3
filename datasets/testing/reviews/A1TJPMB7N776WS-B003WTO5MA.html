<meta name="summary" content="Katchum Wants You"></head><body><p>When George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) and his wife Kathy (Melissa George) move into a dilapidated, but cheap Dutch colonial in the peaceful community of Amityville, Long Island New York they are looking for a place to raise a family and settle down. But their house has a dark, disturbing history. When they ask the realtor about the history of the house and why it is so cheap she tells them that on 11/13/74, Ronald DiFeo, Jr. shot dead his parents and four younger siblings...just a year before.<br />A year later, the Lutzses, after 28 days of living in the house, escape, never to return...not even to pick up their possessions.<br />I approached this newest version of "The Amityville Horror" with skepticism in that so much innovation has occurred in the world of horror/thriller/mystery movies since the original version of 1979 (which I recently viewed again and found to be amatuerish at best and silly at worst), that I didn't expect much of this rehashing of an already told and re-told story. But director Andrew Douglas and writer Scott Kosar have set up the story and realized the film with such care and irrevocably palpable doom and despair, that all thoughts of those earlier versions soon vanish.<br />This Amityville is truly scary...horrific even and Ryan Reynolds, heretofore known as a light comic actor (remember him in the TV series 2 Guys and a Pizza...or some such nonsense), turns in an extraordinary performance as a man who slowly but surely succumbs to the evil and terror of the ghosts and demons of the house he has moved his family into.<br />"The Amityville Horror" is as frightening as you would had hoped "Ring2" to be and director Andrew Douglas deserves credit for bringing not just life, but revitalizing an old subject with goose bump inducing, stomach clenching events that are sure to keep you awake at night...in the time honored tradition of "The Exorcist."<br />Approach "The Amityville Horror" with care...you are likely to get a real glimpse of hell and profound damnation that you had not bargained for.</p></body></html>

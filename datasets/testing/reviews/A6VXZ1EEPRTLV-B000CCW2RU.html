With lots of flash and glitter, and attractive leads in Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson, there's plenty to dazzle the eye, but despite its positive attributes, the film seems to lack originality, realism, and a genuine heart.  Spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.<br /><br />Like most science fiction, The Island puts you in a particular reality.  The year is 2019, and the situation feels a lot like Logan's Run (1976), as a group of people dressed in uniforms, live in a controlled underground environment.  They believe that the outside world is uninhabitable, due to some kind of catastrophic disaster.  All they have to look forward to is winning a trip to `the island', supposedly a paradise.  Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) live in this reality, operated by Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), where nearly everything in their lives is governed by his rules.  Merrick Biotech is actually in the business of raising clones for wealthy clients, to provide them with `spare parts' to prolong their lives.  Clones are programmed to believe a fantasy, and have the intelligence of the average teenager, except that they are unaware of sex.<br /><br />Lincoln 6 (L6) discovers that instead of going to the island, his comrades are being killed and their bodies harvested for whatever parts are required.  Some females are used as child breeders.  Jordan Two (J2) is on her way to the Island, when L6 convinces her to run away, just as Merrick's security team closes in.  The pair escapes from the underground facility, and emerge in a desert area somewhere in Arizona.<br /><br />Clueless about the real world, the pair turns to McCord (Steve Buschemi) a worker at the Merrick facility who helps them to get on their way to Los Angeles, where J2's sponsor lives.  The plan is to have clone and client meet, and find a way to stop Merrick's operation.  To deal with the crisis, Merrick brings in mercenary Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) and his team to hunt down and recapture the runaways.<br /><br />There are plenty of fireworks and over the top action, as the clones evade Laurent's men in Los Angeles.  Among them is a crazy freeway chase reminiscent of Bad Boys II, a fake looking jet bike ride through the crowded skies of LA, and a ridiculous escapade on the side of an office building.  It's a thrill ride, but one without any real sense of danger.  Things do get more interesting when L6 and the real Lincoln come face to face, but once again the plot takes an overdramatic ridiculous turn.  The film's conclusion features a couple of twists, but is still pretty silly and pretentious, as L6 reenters the facility.  Merrick's world comes crashing down, and the once doomed clones run free in the desert, again reminiscent of the finish to Logan's Run.<br /><br />While The Island scores points for its technical achievements, the overload of special effects doesn't compensate for a story that fails to generate actual tension, and make a real emotional connection.  Part of the reason for this is because the clones don't think like real humans.  Johansson and McGregor aren't robots, but they aren't quite real either, and the story fails to connect on a basic human level.  We are supposed to feel joy that clones are set free, but why isn't entirely clear.  It doesn't help that most of the human characters are cartoonish and one dimensional.  Sean Bean and Djimon Hounsou are certainly capable of much more.  Steve Buschemi as McCord, is the only major character with any real personality.<br /><br />Michael Bay's commentaries are typically very articulate and informative, and that is again the case here, although he's a bit more conservative with his words.  You won't get much critical examination of the plot, but he defends product placement, and covers some interesting technical points.  High gloss science fiction with some outrageous thrills and special effects, The Island is a lightweight fantasy that is visual treat, without much of a heart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Challenging, Thoughtful, Captivating -- And Not the "Alien" Prequel Some Expected"></head><body><p>Ridley Scott's triumphant return to the science fiction genre may have started off as a prequel to his 1979 classic "Alien," but PROMETHEUS is a very different type of picture: a suspenseful and captivating film with provocative concepts and thematic material that challenges the viewer as much as it satisfies on a rich aesthetic level.<br /><br />Its "Alien" aspects - and there are some - are secondary to a story that asks where the human race came from, how we got here, and where we're going. Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof's screenplay posits these eternal questions in a manner that's positively refreshing in our current age of soulless blockbusters, opening with an utterly beautiful prologue set on Earth at the dawn of time (shot in Iceland by Scott) and proceeding to follow a spaceship crew in the late 21st century setting out to uncover the answers.<br /><br />Among the crew of the ship "Prometheus" are scientists Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green, gruff captain Idris Elba, icy cold Weyland corporation exec Charlize Theron, and a curious android named David (Michael Fassbender), the work of the elderly Charles Weyland (Guy Pearce) himself, who funded the mission to track down the whereabouts of beings who left "calling cards" on ancient cave paintings around the globe. Upon arriving on a desolate planet, Rapace and company find a dank, deserted chamber with remnants of an alien race that fled the scene some time before - as well as a gooey chemical substance that's anything but benevolent.<br /><br />It's easy to see why some viewers expecting a straight-ahead "Alien" prequel may be turned off by "Prometheus": this film isn't just a variation on its predecessor, with a group of disparate characters running around in the dark from a monster. Its brilliance is due to Scott's blending of familiar genre conventions with a story line that's deeper and more involved than most viewers may be prepared for. Granted, there are times when you wish certain plot points were clarified more than they are - especially in a mid-section that seems a bit rushed - but what's left unanswered aren't so much flaws as they are concepts left intentionally dangling for viewers to further contemplate. It may be less accessible to the masses than "Alien" but it's also emotionally stronger and deeper in terms of what it's attempting to do and say.<br /><br />Rapace's sensitive performance resonates strongly here in the latter regard, giving her character an emotional vulnerability that's wholly sympathetic - not just a Ripley clone, her Elizabeth Shaw is the moral epicenter of a crew that watches as their lofty hopes of finding out where life came from turns into a nightmarish assortment of questions about why the would-be Gods are trying to destroy them. Shaw's unshakeable faith is intriguingly tested by both the circumstance the crew finds themselves in, as well as her unusual relationship with the mysterious David, whose motivations are never entirely made clear in an otherwise fine performance from Fassbender.<br /><br />Scott's penchant for amazing visuals are, of course, on-hand throughout the film, and there are a handful of dynamic set-pieces: a thrilling storm that threatens the crew is later followed by a harrowing "medical" sequence and a sensational finale with a truly miraculous sense of scale. The director said in pre-publicity that he wanted "Prometheus" to be "big" and the film is indeed that, both in the messages it develops and the visuals on-screen. Spectacular effects and haunting creatures include concepts that resemble the work of H.R. Giger, giving fans a taste of the universe that Scott first brought to the screen with "Alien" but here in a very different context. (In fact, if there's a moment that feels somewhat out of step here, it's in a quote from Jerry Goldsmith's unused main title from "Alien" that comes across as unnecessarily shoe-horned into the picture).<br /><br />Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and even the score, credited to Marc Streitenfeld but enhanced with a lovely theme by Harry Gregson-Williams that's used throughout the picture (so much that it's surprising he only received an "Additional Music" credit), are likewise effective: this is a film that's filled with so much artistic invention and memorable images that one can see sci-fi fans returning to "Prometheus" for some time to come, both to dissect its narrative as well as take in its amazing artistic design.<br /><br />Throughout his career, Ridley Scott has shown himself to be a master craftsman in terms of imagery: not just in his classics like "Alien" and "Blade Runner," but also in the commercial failures of "Legend," "1492" and "White Squall." Throughout them all, Scott has brought the beauty of nature and, indeed, different worlds and even whole universes to life, very much like an artist painting on a blank canvas. While not without its flaws, "Prometheus" ranks not only with those films visually, but has one of the most compelling story lines from any of Scott's works, as well as an emotional range that's particularly surprising at its conclusion. It's a movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled, a film that entertains and engages, a sublime mix so rarely seen at the movies any more.</p></body></html>

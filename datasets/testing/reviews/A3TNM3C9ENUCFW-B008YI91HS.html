<meta name="summary" content="Still has "WOW" appeal"></head><body><p>Nearly 10 years on, this Spielberg classic is rivalled only by Jaws for originality, tension, and superb performances. Richard Attenborough plays the stoic billionaire who has discovered how to extract dinosaur DNA from a mosquito fossilised in tree amber, and decides to bankroll a genetics created theme park to wow the World. As always, with these schemes, you should listen to the age old maxim "Don't mess with Mother Nature" and despite the remote Island Location, the huge Reptiles get loose, and go on the rampage. This was the first and definitely best in the series of 3 movies, and I almost wish they'd stopped here, where the trilogy arguably peaked. Wonderfully realistic CGI blends seamlessly with superb acting performances from Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum (to name but a few). The best thing about this picture is it's longevity however. Like "Jaws" it is a non topical and timeless adventure for the whole family (with the exception of very small children). It's gripping, and often scary without being offensive or gratuitous and will undoubtedly be rediscovered by each succesive generation of viewers. Deservedly hailed now as a classic piece of Cinema. A great movie at a great price. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

What a mess."></head><body><p>W. is a film that does not hold back its political opinions, nor does it take pleasure in reaming the former president. It attempts to portray a side of the president that allows the viewer to culminate opinions into something that can help explain why an event played out. But the introduction to its characters are filmed more like a comedy, that is light hearted and silly.<br /><br />I will try not to be too free with my opinions here, but you should not always believe what you read in books, and for movies, you shouldn't believe anything at all. It is another reason why this film was confusing for me. It is at times presented in a very serious, documentary feel, but then it sways into rounds of comedy.<br /><br />This movie does not tell us anything, and in fact led to more confusion than anything. Bush is being judged, and for many has been judged. This is not a great movie. It is a necessity for directors to capture their audiences, but I believe the acting in this movie to never commit to a certain degree of seriousness that W. needed. It is obscured with nonsense, and pays more attention to young, immature avenues. I do not think that this movie to be well made. It should have been more serious, and more demanding of the facts. Presenting a more complete picture of a man that is not fiction, but of history.</p></body></html>

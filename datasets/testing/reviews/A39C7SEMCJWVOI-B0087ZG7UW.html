<meta name="summary" content="PSYCHO: The Original Classic!"></head><body><p>PSYCHO, filmed in black and white, and directed by Alferd Hitchcock is a truly classic horror film. The film starts out with a woman named Marion Crane, who steals some money from her boss and goes out on the road to live the good life with her boyfriend Sam. But along the way, it starts to rain and Marion pulls over at the Bates Motel on the side of the highway. She meets the owner of the motel Norman Bates, who lives in the house on the hill behind the motel with his &quot;mother.&quot; That night, while taking a shower, Marion is stabbed by an old woman with a butcher knife. Murder, madness, and suspense follow shortly after that. Anthony Perkins gives a good performance as the disturbed Norman Bates. All in all, one of the true great classic horror films.</p></body></html>

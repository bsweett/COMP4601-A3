<meta name="summary" content="HOLY #%$@ THIS MOVIE KICKS @$$"></head><body><p>I DON'T CARE WHAT OTHER STUPID PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE THEY ARE JUST HATIN ON THE ROCK CAUSE HE'S A GREAT ACTOR!<br /><br />I REALLY LOVE THE VIDEO GAME AND IT SCARED ME TO DEATH. I WAS EXPECTING A HORROR MOVIE, BUT THIS IS REALLY AN ACTION MOVIE. WELL, WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM AN ACTION MOVIE OTHER THAN LOTS OF SHOOTING AND SOME SUSPENSE? THIS MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SHALLOW.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: AT THE TIME THE REAPER WAKES UP AFTER HAVING BEEN INJECTED WITH CHROMOSOME 24 I JUST WENT BALLISTIC IN THE THEATER. YOU WAKE UP LOOKING OUT OF HIS EYES JUST AS YOU WOULD DO IN THE GAME AND THE FOLLOWING ACTION SEQUENCE WHERE, HA HA CAN'T SAY, I'LL KEEP Y'ALL GUESSING.</p></body></html>

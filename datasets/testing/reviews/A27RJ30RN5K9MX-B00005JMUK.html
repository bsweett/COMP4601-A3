<meta name="summary" content="Charlize gets an "A+".... Movie gets an "F""></head><body><p>"Monster" focuses on the true life story of a woman named Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron). Aileen became a prostitute at the age of thirteen. However, years later she is growing tired of the life and is struggling to find a reason to go on living. That is until she meets a woman who is a lesbian named Selby (Christina Ricci). The two become friends, and the relationship eventually takes a romantic turn. Aileen tries to straighten her life out and make an honest living to support Selby and herself. Unfortunately, after an endless search for jobs, her only alternative is to go back to being a prostitute. Things take a turn for the worse however, when Aileen begins to murder her clientele.<p>Before watching Monster, I was very excited to see the film because of how much praise Charlize Theron was receiving for her performance. Theron gives one of the best performances I have ever seen. She literally transformed herself into Aileen Wuornos. Everything from her violent attitude and the way that she talked, to the physical characteristics of the character. Charlize is an extremely beautiful woman in real life, and she looked down right hideous in the film. The physical change alone was shocking. However, the reason I can only give Monster three stars is because the movie did not have much else going for it. While the interpretation of events were accurate, the movie was boring overall, and Christina Ricci's character Selby came off as an annoying, whining, hypocrite. For example, Selby complains that there is no money coming in, and she convinces Aileen to go back to being a prostitute. Then when she starts hooking again, Selby cries and complains that Aileen is never around.<p>If Charlize Theron had not starred in Monster, it would not be worth watching. It is a shame, that a performance so good, was wasted on such a bad film. However, Theron's performance is so incredible, that it somehow lets you endure the film and marvel at her brilliance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HALLOWEEN RE-VISITED THE UNRATED REVIEW! 2 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>I wanted to do the original Omen for my 666th review, but I have been wanting to watch this film for a long time. My review is for the unrated 3 disc set from Circuit City.<br /><br />I went into this film with the mind set that this was a Halloween movie from a parallel universe. If you want to enjoy this film, try not think of it as a remake....OK?...alright, here we go.<br /><br />This film is well produced and the first half deals with young Michael Myers at age 10. Although sort of interesting to watch, it really doesn't give us much more insight than the original on why he's so evil. Carpenter's film leaves  a lot to the imagination and we all know that what we conjure in our own minds is usually scarier than what we see on screen. This is a new Halloween and we get to see some brutal murders unlike the original. This isn't necessarily a bad a thing.....well,.... I usually don't complain (too much) about really stupid scenes in horror movies, but this film has some real bad ones! Michael is in the mental institution for brutal murders and yet he walks around unchained and is allowed to use forks and knives when he's eating! I guess so he can stab and kill a nurse who is left alone to watch him.<br /><br />Unlike the original in which "The Shape" was actually a slender man and or supernatural being, this guy is huge and should have been restrained in a straight jacket 24/7! I only mention this because it appears Zombie is trying to make this character more "human". Well that requires making sense throughout the film. When a couple of "boneheads" who work in the hospital try to have their way with a new young female patient, what do they do?........ well, they bring her over to Michael Myer's room where the gigantic lunatic(who loves to kill people)sits making his disturbing masks and they rape her with their backs turned to Mr. Myers! Then, they antagonize and hit Mr. Myers as if he isn't a threat! It's scenes like these that keep this from being a much better movie.<br /><br />I had no problem sitting through it's 2 hour time length, but I kept thinking how close Zombie came to making a good horror film. As it is,(at least the unrated version I saw), it's a 2 1/2 star horror film. Only in the last 25 minutes or so did it finally build some tension, something the original had in spades! The Michael Myers in this film does look menacing and the film has an upgraded slick look, so Zombie's heart was in the right place. Some things he got very wrong...Unlike the original, I didn't feel this film had anything to do with Halloween as it just seemed to be in the distant background of the film. Carpenter's version was all about Halloween. Also, making Myers a human nut job took a lot away from the unknown eerieness of the character in the original.<br /><br />The unrated edition has a great transfer and lots of extra goodies. My version had a third disc with the cast at comic con doing a question and answers gig. Now that I have seen the theatrical version, I would have to recommend it over the unrated one, even with some slightly trimmed down gore, it's a way better movie and makes more sense! I give the theatrical version 3 1/2 stars!</p></body></html>

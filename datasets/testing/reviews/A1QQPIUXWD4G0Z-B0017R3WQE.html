One of five good films De Palma ever made out of 20 or more really bad ones(The Untouchables; Carrie; Carlito's Way; and Mission Impossible are the others.)<br /><br />The film's plot is pretty simple in that it follows the rise and fall of the central character: his family relationships and his dealings with society as well as other crime syndicates.  Although the film has every trapping of a cheesy 1980s film as with every other De Palma film, Al Pacino's brilliant performance along with the talents of the supporting actors (Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Robert Loggia) make this film a classic.<br /><br />This is another great mob film that should be in everyone's collection without exception: don't be without it!</p></body></html>

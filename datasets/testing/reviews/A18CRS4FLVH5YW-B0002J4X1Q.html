<meta name="summary" content="Good flick!  Where's the gore?  DVD lacks inspiration!"></head><body><p>I am not a fan of the games.  I rarely (if ever) pick up a video game.  I know about the "Resident Evil" games, I know it's one of the most popular of items.  This movie just lacks "something."  You can't really put your finger on it but overall it's great eye candy.  Great special effects, awesome sound and for once, a good plot!  The biggest problem here though is, for a video game turned movie, this DVD sure lacks quite a bit of inspiration!  Where's the deleted scenes?  Where's the "fun" extras??  Where's the fun???  All are missing unfortunately.  So, I guess we'll have to wait for the real deal when Blade 2 comes to DVD in September.  In the meantime, this DVD is worth a rental.  Cheers!</p></body></html>

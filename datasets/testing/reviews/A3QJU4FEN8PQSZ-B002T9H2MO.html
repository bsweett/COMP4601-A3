<meta name="summary" content="A moving mystery"></head><body><p>An entertaining space mystery, horrifying yet genuinely moving. Kevin Spacey is great as this film's version of HAL.<br /><br />In the future, most of the Earth's energy needs are met by one corporation mining some wonder material on the moon. The protagonist is the sole human operator needed, scheduled to be rotated out soon.<br /><br />On a trip to check out a mining location, he has an accident. This sets off a strange cascade of events, which he has to unravel to understand his situation. And it's a doozy.<br /><br />Production values and effects are good enough, Rockwell's performance is great, and the whole thing is worth a watch or two.</p></body></html>

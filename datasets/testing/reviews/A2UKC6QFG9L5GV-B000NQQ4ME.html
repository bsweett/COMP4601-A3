<meta name="summary" content="APOCALYPSE BACK THEN"></head><body><p>It just amazes me how it is possible to shoot a film that's longer than two hours with subtitles, with no - let alone stars - with no rather well-known actors, which would have you glued to your seat for all its length. Nothing's impossible for Mel Gibson I guess. I really like this transition of his to the director's path, and with four films behind his back he became one of the most notable contemporary directors like Clint Eastwood once did.<br /><br />It's amazing how Gibson can make a popular film but still deliver his idea to the audience. The scent of apocalypse didn't leave me during the whole movie and that's quite an achievement of the filmmakers. Today we used to think (and it's not for nothing) Maya civilization was one of the most developed one of the ancient world, Mayans were great architects, they had science, they had a calendar etc. And I repeat our thoughts on this didn't come just out of nowhere. Mayans were all that. But Apocalypto adds some coloration to the theme. The pyramids people admire today at the time of Mayan bloom were reddened with blood of those sacrificed for Mayan gods. Along with being quite civilized in today's terms, they had slavery and they killed ruthlessly. But this was the world back then. It was a time when death was a common thing, it was all around and no one actually paid attention. It was a time when war was all a grown up man could occupy himself with. Those were the rules. And this apocalyptic feeling appearing during the film is an ingenious Gibson's intent. It was the end of Mayan civilization and you can feel it. It was the civilization that killed itself from the inside with endless murder and cruelty. Spaniards just finished what Mayans started themselves. This is the apocalypse that takes place before our eyes - we see just a couple of days of life of a great people, but we can see its whole history in these couple of days.<br /><br />Of course Apocalypto is violent. I wouldn't say it's extremely violent but right to that extent to show us what was the everyday reality at that time. We see beheadings and hearts being ripped out at the top of a Mayan sacrifice temple, combat scenes that are even more graphic than those in Braveheart, less mass though. We see a huge pit just out of the city limits filled with bodies of people sacrificed... Sure all these scenes are not gratuitous. And miraculously you don't feel they offend you or they are out of place. If you take them within the whole story, attached to the time all the action takes place in, you start percepting them like they are quite natural. Like all this violence was natural for Maya people.<br /><br />Apocalypto is made this way so that you can fully experience everything that happens and feel like you are one of the people that lived at that period. When after the first hour of the film that predominantly took part in the forest I saw the Mayan city made of stone, I gasped along with the movie's characters who saw it for the first time in their lives.<br /><br />The second part of Apocalypto reminds some action movie, but still the picture doesn't fail to convey its message. If we look closer we see our society is not far from what Maya were. But the more they made it on the road of civilization the closer to the end they were. Looks quite nowdays to me. As it is said in the beginning (not sure if it's verbatim) - civilizations are not destroyed externally, they destroy themselves from the inside. And Gibson's film is quite a vivid example to this phrase.</p></body></html>

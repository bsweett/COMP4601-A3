<meta name="summary" content="3 and 1/2 Stars and Much Better than the Critics Say"></head><body><p>I read more reviews that didn't like this film than those who did. I usually don't care what critics say (I loved SAW II) and they were wrong here as well. The acting is what makes this film. The three leads (Jake G, Peter S, and Jamie Foxx) are all outstanding here. The first half of Jarhead contains a lot of humor, while the second half is very serious in tone. It's like two different films, but they both mesh together nicely. This is not an action film by any means. I was fooled to believe so by the previews, so thanks to those pesky critics I read, I went into the theater expecting a drama with very little action. And because I knew what to expect, I got exactly what I wanted. Jarhead probably will never break into the list of best war films ever made, but it is one that should be respected for showing a different side of war, one where the main character never fires a single shot in combat.</p></body></html>

I'd hedged at watching it because I haven't had great luck with Indian films (though <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U2U0E4">The Namesake</a> is pretty good).<br /><br />What should you know if you haven't seen this film yet, and you are trying to decide whether you should see it?  Here are a few thoughts:<br /><br />1) The film is set in Mombai, India<br />2) There are images of extreme poverty, including use and implied abuse of children, especially of orphans<br />3) There is portrayal of religious-based violence<br />4) There is street violence<br />5) The storyline is compelling, and you find it difficult to look away<br />6) The characters seem genuine, and the acting is good overall<br />7) You will find the cinematography and the casting to be outstanding<br /><br />To be frank, I didn't know what to expect when we started watching this film.  Just a few minutes into the film we sent our 10-yr old to another room to do something else while we watched this DVD.  This is NOT a film for children.  The violence and apparent hopeless situation of the children living in Mombai's slums was simultaneously heart-wrenching and exciting.<br /><br />A solid show through and through.</p></body></html>

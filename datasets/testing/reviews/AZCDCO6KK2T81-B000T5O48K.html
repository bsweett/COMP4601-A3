This, ironically, appeals to Judd's character who has been seeking, in her own way, some relevance in a world that has ignored her pain.  It oddly gives her a sense of importance and a reason to hate those around her who have either pointed a judgmental finger at her for literally losing her son (which could happen to anyone) or have done little to help her out of her miserable life (even though she created some of her own misery).<br /><br />Judd's character is both an in-depth, evolving character and a stereotype of a crack-smoking waitress with no ambition in life other than to wallow in self-pity, hang with the wrong crowd and then wonder why her life is so screwed up.  This is a tragically multi-layered character and performance.  Judd deserves an Oscar nomination as she portrays both a pathetic lost soul who has done little to improve her life and someone we feel great compassion for regardless of her shortcomings.  She has created a character that we want to hit with a 2 x 4 in the head one moment, and cradle in our arms and comfort the next.  In a year where many have complained of few good women roles, I can't help but wonder why this performance has gone relatively unnoticed.<br /><br />Shannon, as the mentally ill stranger, is very good in his role too, but he, ironically, is the less interesting of this essentially two-character film.  I found his twitches and mumblings are all too stereotypical of this kind of part.  I found very little real depth to him at all and he, sadly, evokes very little sympathy for the sick man that he is.  I wanted to feel more for him, but simply couldn't.  Perhaps that was intentionally done by the playwright as, in reality, mentally ill people, sadly, annoy us more than touch us.  It is the disability for which we can't readily assist someone; therefore, we often look the other way.  It is not the same as trying to assist someone deaf, blind, or wheelchair restricted.  We can't simply open a door for them.  Mental illness is the often ignored disability because it makes us uncomfortable to be around such individuals.  We only pay attention after the violence happens that is sometimes associated with the kind of severe mental illness depicted in this film, and only then do we cry out, "Why didn't someone help this man."<br /><br />This is a film that definitely will not appeal to the masses.  It is both character and story driven, but it's claustrophobic, violent, surreal, sad, pathetic, and just down right depressing.  I can't say that I felt the bugs like many reviewers on here have said as I never accepted them as there in the first place, but the sad life of Judd's character lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.

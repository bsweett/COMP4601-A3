<meta name="summary" content="Undoubtedly the greatest film of all time!"></head><body><p>There is truth in this farce.  Dark, terrible truth.  The distillation of government competency is howlingly funny (and unfortunately seemingly real).  If there was one film that ever went for the jugular it was this  one.  Non-conformist to traditional film ideals this deals with the  scariest possibility that those entrusted with power know absolutely  nothing about how to use it.  Except to misuse it.  Ignorance in the  highest reaches of  government is sugar coated as satirical humor.  Afterward, in reflection, the audience understands there's nothing funny  about it.</p></body></html>

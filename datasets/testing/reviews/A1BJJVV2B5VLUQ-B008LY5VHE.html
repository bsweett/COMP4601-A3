Support from a wonderful  cast: Roy Scheider (the town sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (the out of town  shark expert), and the late great Robert Shaw (the fisherman &amp; his  boat). This movie follows the book for the most part with the exception of  Hooper (Dreyfuss' character) living and not being a statistic at the  movie's end. Some memorable scenes... The opening scene of the first victim  taking a skinny dip at night, 2. a mother dressed in black talking to the  sheriff after her son fell prey to the shark, 3. Hooper almost gets eaten  while diving in the cage, 4. Quint (Shaw) meets his demise, and 5. Brody  kills the shark. Some memorable lines... Mayor Vaughn: &quot;We have caught  and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers.&quot;  Brody: &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot; Quint: &quot;The thing  about a shark, it's got lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When  it comes at you it doesn't seem to be livin'... until he bites you, and  those black eyes roll over white.&quot; Some tongue &amp; cheek humor mixed  in with high drama and suspense. The only drawback I saw with this movie  was the ending. I thought it was a bit corny at first. But after watching  the movie for about the 50th time I noticed that the book on sharks that  Brody is flicking through features a shark with a diver's tank in its  mouth. This movie is tied together very well - from beginning to end.  Awesome &amp; ahead of it's time. Essential in any movie buff's library.</p></body></html>

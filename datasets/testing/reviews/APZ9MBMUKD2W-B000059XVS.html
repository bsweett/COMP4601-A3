Men like Gordan, Wingate & Clive who you don't really know where to place them. But none the less they are very valuable men to have around in a tight place. This film takes the story of Lawrence as he goes from a raw junior Officer to Desert Legend. While it could of been very easy to make it one of those Ripping Good storys about one of the lads winning the war by themself in Arabia. The story resists this impluse and so makes itself a legend in itself. I can not praise this film too highly!</p></body></html>

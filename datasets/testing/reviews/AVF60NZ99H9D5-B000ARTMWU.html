<meta name="summary" content="twist ending could use some un-twisting"></head><body><p>Terrific horror flick. Well done all around--but I must say this: I hated the damn twist ending so much that I am tempted to reveal it! But I won't.<br /><br />Aja and his partner Levasseur are going places in this genre, no doubt about it. Only let us hope and pray that they stay clear of annoying twist endings in the future.<br /><br />Get the widescreen UNRATED VERSION  if you can. Gore effects, by the way, are top notch. This is one suspenseful horror flick that will have you on the edge of your seat--that is, up until around the twist--and then you'll go: What? No way!<br /><br />(And you'll say a few other things that I can't print here.)<br /><br />I suppose mainstream audiances may not be bothered by it as much, although the true horror fan will be ticked off plenty. Still worth getting.</p></body></html>

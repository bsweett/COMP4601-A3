<meta name="summary" content="DVD treatment it deserves"></head><body><p>Believe the hype. The film is a masterpiece. Period. And one movie everyone must experience.<p>I'll comment instead on the extras, particularly Roger Ebert's incredibly informative and engaging commentary. He loves movies, loves &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and it shows. He loads it with anecdotes, educational information, and not a few spoilers on the special effects and goofs. Ebert presents what amounts to an excellent Citizen Kane 101 lecture where the film, and not the lecturer, takes center stage. Nice job.<p>Unfortunatley, Peter Bogdanovich's commentary is sub-par. When he's not name-dropping (&quot;When I met Orson... I asked Orson&quot; blah blah), he suffers from the annoying tendency to recount what's on the screen. <p>And the rest of the extras are excellent too. Great DVD transfer.</p></body></html>

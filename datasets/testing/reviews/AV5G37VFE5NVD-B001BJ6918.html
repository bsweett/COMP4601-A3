<meta name="summary" content="Q.T. Strikes Again: Fitting climax for a Tarantino epic"></head><body><p>KILL BILL: VOL. 1 surpassed my highest expectations.  Being the Big Q.T.'s first sequel, I wasn't sure how KILL BILL: VOL. 2 would turn out.  Why would I even worry?  With Q.T. at the reins, there's no way KB2 was gonna suck.<p>The film, naturally, begins with Chapter Six, entitled "Massacre at Two Pines".  It deals with the events that took place before the event that left The Bride (Uma Thurman) a widow.  By the way, we do learn her name by the end of the film - but, just to keep you happy, I won't tell ya.  After this segment, and a 50's-style intro by The Bride herself, we pick up where the first film left off - with three more names on her list - retired redneck Budd (a.k.a. Sidewinder - Michael Madsen), treacherous and skilled beauty Elle Driver (a.k.a. California Mountain Snake - Daryl Hannah), and the big man himself: Bill (a.k.a. Snake Charmer - David Carradine).  There really isn't much of a story to give away - The Bride's still looking for satisfaction, on her rampage, bla-bla-bla.<p>KB2 may be even more campy than the first film.  It certainly features more references to other films, particularly the Shaw Bros. pics of the 70's (which starred Gordon Liu, who plays kung-fu master Pai Mei).  It is, like the first film, completely entertaining, and - more than once - very funny.  One thing's for sure - if "Reservoir Dogs", "Pulp Fiction" and the first "Kill Bill" didn't prove it, "Kill Bill: Vol. 2" sure does - no one makes films like Quentin Tarantino.</p></body></html>

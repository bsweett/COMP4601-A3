The simple diamond has become director Ed Zwick's latest interest, and here he explores this rock in such depth and detail, it is both amazing and scary. One thing is for sure, I will never look at diamonds the same way.<br /><br />Danny Archer is a diamond smuggler, a Rhodesian who has ties to some large corporations, like Van De Kaap. Soloman Vandy is a fisherman from a local village that is pillaged by rebels R.U.F. who are at civil war vying for diamond fields. Danny gets caught by the local government trying to smuggle diamonds out of Africa and is put in jail. Soloman is separated from his family during the destruction of his village, and the rebels take him in to help them harvest diamonds. He comes upon a pink diamond, a large rock, one of the rarest in the world. Soon after, while struggling with Captain Poison, a rebel leader who finds out about the diamond, the rebel camp is attacked by the government's military unit and he is forced to bury the diamond. With a twist of fate, he ends up in the same prison where Danny is. Danny finds out about the diamond, and in a bid to repay what he lost when he was caught, and also to get out of Africa, he arranges to get Soloman out of prison and engage his help to find the diamond. In return, he promises Soloman to help locate his family. At around the same time, Danny also meets Maddy, a journalist who aspires to uncover the truth about conflict diamonds, that these diamonds reach the shores of countries like the U.S or England, and that large corporations are hiding that fact. Danny agrees to help her, if she would use her influence as a journalist to find Soloman's family. "Yes, I am using him and you are using me, and that's how it goes," Danny says. The story ensues...<br /><br />The story, while totally riveting in it's delivery, never clouds the backbone of this movie, the illegal mining of these conflict diamonds, and its effects on the country and the people. Back when this story was set, I was still a teenager and oblivious to these issues. I'm guessing many adults were, too. I read many reviews criticizing Blood Diamond, saying that it felt like a documentary. Isn't that a compliment? To be able to provoke some sort of emotion upon viewing the horrifying acts of man for money and power. To watch young children recruited by the rebels to kill, trained to have no conscience whatsoever. It is really sad to think that all these was happening just a few years ago, and probably still is, although not as much. Your heart goes out to these people who have been enslaved and tortured. One character says "Thank God they did not find oil."<br /><br />The acting is top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a consistently great performance in every movie he's in and it's no exception here. He is unflinching as the ruthless Danny Archer. Definitely not playing to the usual hero mold, he is never really the good guy throughout the movie, even in the end his moral obligation is somewhat questionable. He always has an ulterior motive. The only times we see his vulnerabilities is when he is talking with Maddy. One of my favorite lines from the movie is uttered here. "Sometimes I wonder if God will ever forgive us for what we've done to each other...then I look around and I realize, God left this place a long time ago." Delivered with such emotion that it simply grabs you. A well deserved Oscar nomination for his role here. Another great actor is Djimon Honsou, playing Soloman Vandy. Soloman is a simple man, a family-oriented guy who cares about nothing else but his family. He is naive in a sense and when his family is taken, you can feel the grief in him. He is overwhelmed with what is happening around him. Where Danny blends perfectly with this environment, Soloman seems struggling to apprehend it. And Jennifer Connelly plays the journalist, Maddy Bowen. Maddy has a great intensity to know the real story behind this industry, but we, the audience are always left questioning, will that knowledge change anything? She certainly feels it will and is unwavering in her mission to find out. Danny and Maddy had some great chemistry, and ultimately that connection between them plays a vital role in the end of the movie.<br /><br />Other than this, many other factors contribute to the success of this movie. The cinematography is brilliant. It depicts the civil war to an amazing level of realism. The music was also fantastic, infusing native sounds with orchestral elements to create a sweeping score of epic proportions. I am also eagerly anticipating this 2-disc DVD set, particularly because I am very interested to see how Ed Zwick delved into this industry, how he researched blood diamonds, the smuggling of this rocks, the people behind it, the wars and how the actors themselves prepared for the roles.<br /><br />In the end, the true power of this movie transcends what can be seen on the screen. It really is more about what is felt upon watching this movie. Sure, finally everything is tied up with a nice little bow, but the movie claims that civil unrest still exists in the nation of Africa. Parts of the problem are resolved, but for every solution, there is a new problem creeping up. Ultimately, I'm guessing that this movie was not made with the idea of finding a resolution to the wars, but I think for it to even make us think about the consequences of buying conflict diamonds, to give us a "pang" of realization what occurs behind the scenes of how these magnificent jewels are obtained is a huge success in itself. And it certainly did do exactly that for me. Powerful, compelling and real would be some of the words I would choose to describe this awe-inspiring movie. A superb effort and one the best pictures I have seen. Wholeheartedly recommended.</p></body></html>

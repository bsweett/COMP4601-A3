<meta name="summary" content="Great action, but with a bomb crater where its heart should be"></head><body><p>2009's Oscar winner for Best Picture was a bit of a bust. The film follows the work of a bomb-disposal unit in Iraq. There's plenty of boom-boom, and the film provides a sense of Iraq that is dreary, desolate and dangerous. But like many recent war movies -- "Jar Heads" being one -- it fails to deliver on the inner lives of its characters. We see comrades fighting brutally among themselves and taking insane risks, but get no insight into what drives them. Even the "hurt locker" of the title barely gets its due. Some might call this respecting the audience's intelligence, but I call it lazy and shallow.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the film has little to say about Iraq, and less to say about modern warfare or the life of a soldier. Other than "war is fun for some people."</p></body></html>

I thought I might meet one of the many movie families we've seen in recent years who bounce a series of contrived eccentricities off each other. But this movie turned out to be a wonderful surprise.<br /><br />This was like eavesdropping on a real family, a family of real people who care about each other and who draw us into caring about them. As I was watching, I was reminded of the 1970's TV documentary featuring the Loud Family. In that pioneering reality programming, cameras were installed in a "typical" suburban home, and we viewers got to be flies on the wall as the Louds went through a series of anything-but-typical triumphs and tragedies. Coincidentally, the Director and Writer of  "Little Miss Sunshine" mentioned the Loud documentary in their DVD commentary. They said their screen drama began to remind THEM of the Loud chronicle as they tweaked the script and got it on film.<br /><br />Now, because of all the probing Dr. Phils and webcams everywhere, we can continuously eavesdrop on real life family drama. It's hard for any scripted drama to compete with all this reality. But I think "Sunshine" succeeds. It has the ring of truth; but it also has a satisfying dramatic arc. It captures what could be the plausible dynamics between family members as they, with all their diverse preoccupations, take to the road to get their little daughter to the spot she qualified for by default in a California beauty pageant.<br /><br />The only lapse in logic here is that none of these family members have foreknowledge of the kind of contest they are headed into. With all the notoriety surrounding the JonBenet Ramsey case, you would think everyone would be aware of what standards little girl beauty pageant contestants have to meet. But it seems all the members of this "Miss Sunshine" movie family are na?ve on that score. They don't suspect that their youngest child may not be geared to project the right sort of precocious sex appeal. And there is a disconnect between the little girl's looks and the talent presentation that her grandfather coached her into preparing.<br /><br />But this is a minor quibble. On the whole, I bought the premise and became engrossed. I rode along with this family in their clutch-challenged van through all their copings. And I was sorry when the ride was over.</p></body></html>

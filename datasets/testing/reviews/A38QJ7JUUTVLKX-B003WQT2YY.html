It'll make you laugh with it's querky sense of humor, and will awe you with it's wonderful story. A note-perfect cinematic event whose immortality was assured from its opening night, Amadeus is an unlikely candidate for the director's-cut treatment. The last thing you would expect a high school junior to go ga-ga over is a movie about long-dead classical composers. Screenwriter Peter Shaffer adapted the work from his own play, a fictional history meditating on the lives of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and musical rival Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). All is told in flashback through the eyes of Salieri, who sees Mozart as a vulgar creature with divine gifts. Eventually, Salieri views Mozart's music as an insult from God, and he tries to undermine the young composer at every opportunity. During this time you just can't help but laugh, because everytime he thinks he's got something Mozart shows him up. It's a great film, and must be seen by everyone. It's to good to be kept to one's self.</p></body></html>

The monsters are perfectly animated with each hair flowing seamlessly on the blue monster "Sulley" (John Goodman). Sulley is a whimsical work of art to watch.  He has a buddy and job partner, "Mike" (Billy Crystal) who is a round green guy, with one eye and much smaller than Sully.  He talks all the time, but means well.  They both work for Monsters, Inc., a large company that specializes in children's screams they capture in a bottle.  This is bottled energy that monster land needs to keep lights on and refrigerators running.<br /><br />Monster's Inc. has an assembly line of doors from all over the world.  Once set up in a large room all the monsters enter and they emerge from a child's closet.  A frightening scream from the child is extracted and then the monsters go back through the door and another one is set up.  Kids begin to get used to the monsters and are not scaring as easily.  There is a energy shortage in Monster Land.<br /><br />Then one day, a little girl, Boo (Mary Gibbs) grabs Sully who she thinks is a big "Kitty".  He brings her into the factory by mistake.  Wow - the monsters are scared stiff of children and an exciting adventure ensues.  One discovery is that children's laughter gives more energy than their screams.<br /><br />We have to have a bad guy so Monster's Inc. plot includes a villain that looks like a purple lizard.  He can disappear and reappear and he has a evil plan for extracting screams.<br /><br />The ending is happy and you are glad you watched such an endearing tale.</p></body></html>

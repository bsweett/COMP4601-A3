<meta name="summary" content="Roller coaster thrills marred by swiss cheese plot"></head><body><p>John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is chief of the Precrimes Unit in Washington, D.C. in the year 2053. The unit has abolished murder in their city with the aid of three "precogs" who can see the crimes before they happen. Police arrest the suspect based on the visions and the prisoner's are put into suspended animation immediately. The "trial" each receives is apparently limited to their appearance in the precog visions. Anderton believes in the system wholeheartedly and is proud of the results. Just after he learns of odd discrepancies in a few cases, however, the precogs have a vision that implicates him in the murder of a man he's never heard of. Anderton makes a run for it to try and prove his innocence. The rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride as he tries to escape from the police while uncovering the real villain.<br /><br />Minority Report is a mixed bag of a movie. The action sequences are all exciting and Cruise conveys enough urgency that it goes a long way toward carrying the film. At the same time, the plot suffers from numerous holes and inconsistencies. For example, the precogs can only see a murder when the killer forms the intent. But Anderton's murder is predicted even though he knows nothing about the victim and certainly has no intention of killing him.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Minority Report. It's well produced and Cruise's energy and passion in the role help show once again why he's a major star. The story doesn't hold up very well to even casual analysis so you need to be prepared to just let that slide or skip the movie completely.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What is The One Really?"></head><body><p>At the end of the first movie, Neo became The One.  Now he is legendary amongst the free humans and the city of Zion.<br /><br />But what is The One really?  Who is the Oracle and why is she allowed to exist?  That is the main thrust of this chapter of the Matrix saga.<br /><br />But no quest is simple.  Agent Smith has brand new abilities thanks to his defeat by Neo in the first movie.  No longer is he a simple enforcement program.  Now he is more like a virus, able to overwrite his code onto others.<br /><br />So we have Neo's quest to find out what he is, the new threat from Smith, and of course the machines are stepping up their efforts to wipe out the free humans.  Quite a lot for a movie that some feel is just a bunch of special effects.<br /><br />But this movie is not just special effects.  The answered questions go a long way to making this chapter make far more sense than the first.  The setting is some time after the first movie and it would be nice to know a little more about what went on during that time but the revelation of Zion helps to make up for it.<br /><br />All in all this is a very good sequel although the true movie was too long and it was split into two pieces.  This means that this chapter ends a little abruptly and you might want to have the next chapter available before you watch this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unrequited Love Drama, Not Comedy"></head><body><p>This is a strange story told from the point of view of a daughter writing a college application essay.<br /><br />Tea Leoni is a rich woman who has just hired a new housekeeper who only speaks Spanish, a language Leoni cannot speak.  Her husband, Sandler, is head chef at a fine restaurant.  Both Leoni and the housekeeper have young daughters.  Tea also has a son.<br /><br />Tea Leoni sees the housekeeper's daughter as the daughter she would love to have and sets out to make it true in action if not in fact.  This causes stresses all across the board.  Eventually Sandler shows up and meets the housekeeper.  Eventually love begins to blossom between the two but both know it can not be allowed to go anywhere.<br /><br />In the end everyone seems to have had a fight with everyone else (not really true but it sure seems like it) and the film ends in a way most audiences will not like but will eventually convince themselves is the best that could have happened given the circumstances.  My real problem with this long long film is that it seemed very choppy.  I felt I was watching a film adaptation of a long novel and that crucial scenes had been left out.  This is apparently not the case but everyone I watched it with felt the same way.  We all agreed it was strange, choppy, erratic, and definitely NOT a comedy.  But do not be fooled by this, you will see some very good acting from most of the cast (especially the housekeeper's daughter), it is just the story that suffers and no amount of good acting can fill that in.</p></body></html>

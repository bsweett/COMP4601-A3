<meta name="summary" content="extremely strong performances make the story more memorable"></head><body><p>This movie is intense, cinematically beautiful, and exceptionally well acted. Strong supporting performances from Jennifer Connolly House of Sand and Fog, Requiem for a Dream) and Djimon Hounsou (Alias Season 3, Amistad) highlight a sublime performance from Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed, The Basketball Diaries). DiCaprio has been churning out really good performances since his Oscar-nominated role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? It's a shame that he was thought of as just another pretty boy and that most people consider his mediocre performance in Titanic the highlight of his career. His performance in Blood Diamond should solidify his status as one of the greatest actors of his generations (and those muscles should make even more women swoon).<br /><br />The subject matter of the movie is captivating and heart wrenching. This is a story that needs to be told; that must be told. And Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai, Glory) does it justice in this film.<br /><br />After watching this film, I am justified in what I've been saying for years - I never want a diamond as the stone in my wedding ring or any other sort of diamond.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="In the Shadow of Manhattan"></head><body><p>The 1985 graphic novel of Watchmen by comic book great Alan Moore is one of the most impressionable pieces of literature that I've read in years. And Zack Snyder's movie interpretation is one of the few films that I've ever seen that kept so closely true to the book.<br /><br />Is Watchmen a movie about superheroes? Actually, I believe that the characters prefer "costumed adventurers" instead of superheroes...with the exception of one character in particular. The difference between superhero and costumed adventurer here is the difference between super-powers and plain old bravery and smarts. And just plain old bravery and smarts can't protect you from a bullet or a stronger man (or woman).<br /><br />So when one of the approximately five still practicing costumed adventurers called The Comedian is murdered, Rorschach, a tough, shifting-ink-blot mask wearing anti-hero makes it his business to find the killer and warn the other adventurers of a villain potentially bent on getting rid of the remaining "masks".<br /><br />I mentioned earlier "an exception" to the costumed versus super-powered adventurers...that exception is Dr. Manhattan. The question is not what can Dr. Manhattan do that's so special; the question is, what can't he do? So with a guy like Manhattan on your side...whether it's literally "your" side or say "your county's" side, ya can't lose, right?<br /><br />But what if Dr. Manhattan decided to skip town for a while? Yeah. Exactly. You guessed it. Like if Tiger Woods left golf for a season due to injury...who'd watch golf anymore? Who'd watch the Watchmen?<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend the novel over the movie, but what else is new? That's always the case with novels turned movies. The ending of the movie mirrors the novel with bit of a change and even makes a bit more sense as the twists and turns of a diabolical plot are unveiled. But as I said earlier, this minor alteration in the integrity of the story originally told by Alan Moore in graphic novel form does really not affect the brilliance of the original concept.<br /><br />If you don't have the time for the novel, this 3-hour Director's Cut is a wonderful alternative...not just for comic book and graphic novels fans, but for fans of Truth, Justice and the American Way!

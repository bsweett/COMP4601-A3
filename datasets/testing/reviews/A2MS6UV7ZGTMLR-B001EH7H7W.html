<meta name="summary" content="A fun movie that should not be taken seriously!"></head><body><p>Q:  What do you get when you create a story based on teaming up the combined talents of heroes born of many of the world's most famous literary classics of the past, including H Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines, Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, Robert Louise Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and Herman Melville's Moby Dick?<br /><br />A:  A ripping good yarn. But you also inherit a minefield by borrowing from so many loved literary classics.<br /><br />A ripping good yarn is the way that the big-budget, popcorn action film The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen should be approached. It is a highly entertaining, rip-roaring tale exploring the fantasy of what might have been possible had all these extraordinary fictional characters been able to team up for a common purpose. The thought that these characters were originally created of completely different time periods and not of the same collective fictional universe should be left behind. This film is not meant to be taken too seriously - it is purely and simply a bit of fun. Unfortunately though, many critics have panned the film outright by seizing on numerous inconsistencies in the portrayal of these classic literary characters as not being completely authentic to their original authors. I can appreciate from a literary sense where these critics are coming from and can understand why this film irks those who love the classics. But still, one should hardly expect that a story idea based on bringing together such a highly fanciful collaboration of all these characters will result in anything other than an excuse to have a bit of fun. Viewed with this overriding goal in mind, once you allow your criticism of minor inconsistencies of the character portrayals to be suspended, The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen delivers on the fun scale in spades.<br /><br />The fun thing about this film is that you don't have to have read all of these literary classic to enjoy the movie. There are many "in-references" inserted throughout to cater for those who have an appreciation of the abovementioned novels and others including the works of Ian Fleming and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but certainly the movie can be appreciated as a stand-alone experience even if you only know some or few of these works. As an aside, the fact that the film tries to be rather cute in playing to the intelligentsia of its audience with its many deliberate "in-references" is only problematic, given that those same audience members to whom such references are aimed will also by corollary tend to be the same people who care enough about the classics to highlight the resultant inconsistencies in the character treatments. I think this, more than any other reason, is ultimately why The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen failed to impress the critics more than it did; you simply can't have your cake and eat it too.<br /><br />The storyline is very well thought-out, if not arguably a bit too rushed for my liking, with a large amount of story and action crammed into a 110 minute film. The plot is premised around cramming in as much action into the story as possible, with every hero given a chance to shine in their turn. This is also a big-budget action film, so the production values are high, particularly in aspects such as the attention to detail in the character costumes. The special effects are also, for the most part, great - it's just a pity that only one or two dodgy effects shots stand out to prove an exception to a great job (these one or two shots being suboptimal only due to the lack of time available to complete them before the theatrical release date (the usual story)). The acting in this film is certainly rock solid, and this is particularly the case - yet again - with Sean Connery. Can this man do nothing wrong in the acting stakes? I don't think I have ever seen him deliver a poor performance. This view has been stated a million times before me by a million other film reviewers, but I agree that Sean Connery really is one of, if not the, most arresting and most charismatic screen personalities of our time. With all of these positives going for it then, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a highly entertaining action flick.</p></body></html>

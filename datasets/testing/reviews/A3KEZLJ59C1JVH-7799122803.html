<meta name="summary" content="It's the WRONG ALICE! (The better Alice!)"></head><body><p>For someone who is not a big fan of the story "Alice in Wonderland," I am surprised that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. In Tim Burton's film, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is all grown up and escapes from an unwanted marriage proposal by falling down a rabbit hole and returning to the strange world she visited during her childhood. The kingdom is in peril, suffering under the rule of the Red Queen (played brilliantly by Helena Bonham Cater, who is by far the best part of the movie). Alice encounters many old friends, including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), who attempts to help Alice slay the Red Queen's Jabberwocky and save the kingdom.<br /><br />This is a very good film. The story is clever and the cast is very good, with the exception of Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. (Her idea of acting in this film is keeping her arms raised above her head the entire time. So annoying.) I saw the movie in 3D, which is something I didn't think I would enjoy but actually did. Instead of being a distraction, the 3D effects just served to make Alice's world look even stranger.<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" still isn't my favorite fairy tale, but this new and improved version is much more enjoyable than the original Disney cartoon, and I recommend seeing it in the theatre for the 3D experience.</p></body></html>

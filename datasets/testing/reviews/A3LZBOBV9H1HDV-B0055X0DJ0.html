This is how the story goes: With the help of the Autobots, the soldiers of NEST, and an old adversary-turned-ally, Sam and Mikaela must uncover the secret history of the Transformers presence on earth, and the sacrifices that have to be made to save it from an ancient threat sworn on returning here for revenge... an ancient Decepticon named THE FALLEN.<br /><br />The cast led by Shia LaBeouf (as Sam) & Megan Fox (as Mikaela) is great! The directing by Michael Bay (also executive produced) (who also directed the first "Transformers" (2007), he also produced "The Unborn" (2009), "Friday The 13th" (2009) and is also producing the upcoming remake to "A Nightmare On Elm Street" (2010) is great!

The casting by Denise Chamian (who also did the casting to "The Island", "The Taking Of Pelham 123" (2009) & the upcoming "The Rum Diary" (2010) is great! The production design by Nigel Phelps (who also did the production design to "Troy" (2004), "The Island", "Pearl Harbor" & "The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor") is great!

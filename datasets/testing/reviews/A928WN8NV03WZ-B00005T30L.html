The movie unfortunately is made to be a realistic look of a time that I would rather forget, and people that you don't always want to know.<br /><br />Enid is a classically angst ridden girl.  She is smart enough to know how illusion ridden the world is around her, but not smart enough to know what her part in this is.  So she and her friend are the definition of defeatist youth.  They have little ambition, like to play cruel jokes, and everything seems to exist for them to criticize.  Due to their temperment they aren't good at keeping jobs, so spend a lot of time with their artwork and practical jokes.  School wasn't over long ago, but they have few friends from the experience and it is quickly turning into faded memories.<br /><br />This turns around when they are looking through the I saw you ads of their local paper and find one of a lonely man who felt that something had passed between him and a girl he met at an airport.  So they make a response to the ad and arrange a meeting to see what will happen when the man shows up finds no one is coming to meet him.  This is where they meet Steve Buscemi's nerdy character, working at an office for a fried chicken company, and a vinyl junkie.<br /><br />They watch him and for some reason Enid becomes fascinated with him and starts befriending him and learning about his life.  Trying to break him out of his dull day by day existence.<br /><br />Then the film seems to take a down turn.  Enid starts to see her world quickly crumbling around her.  Her father has a new girlfriend and thinks she should move out.  Her best friend is getting frustrated with the fact that Enid isn't going anywhere and giving up on their plans.  Her attempts at holding a job with her tendency to make jokes at everything around her and temper fail miserably.<br /><br />I think that this movie is well made, but I just didn't like it.  The characters were realistic, the situations familar, the filming and casting had a gritty and realistic quality, but it seemed shallow in a lot of ways.  A lot of the characters just are, there is little to no background on them.<br /><br />Plus the main character, Enid, is extremely difficult to like.  She is too defeatist and depressing to really get into.  Her character goes from one self initiated disaster to another, her wit seeming less and less endearing, and her character seeming less and less intelligent.  There are some times when the feelings of lonlieness and confusion hit her character and you feel a spark for her.  But her tendency to take others with her when she falls ruins it.  Enid attacks people for fun or lashes out at others for her emotional problems.  You never really see why she is so hostile to everybody in her life, and this is a big part of her character. Or why she is so intersted in Steve Buschemi's character.  I also found her best friend a mystery, a girl thats just there.<br /><br />Though I think that the film was wonderfully made, I just didn't like it.  The characters were too defeatist and their rapid spiral downward too frustrating to want to watch twice.  As well as the many unanswered questions about the characters.<br /><br />I hope that the director and actress do something else that is in similar caliber, but with different material, because it shows a lot of potential.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Failure to Launch"></head><body><p>Trip (McConaughey) is a 35 year old that still lives with Mom (Bates) and Dad (Bradshaw).  They do everything for him, and they are his ticket out of serious relationships.  One day, Mom and Dad hire Paula (Parker), an "interventionist" who specializes in getting kids out of their parents homes.  Her plan: get Trip to fall in love with her which will make him want to break away from his parents.  Of course, things do not go smoothly and Paula finds herself falling in love.  When Trip's friends find out what she does for a living, things get even worse for Paula.<br /><br />"Failure to Launch" is a so-so movie.  Fans of the romantic comedy will probably like the film, but there is nothing special about it.  There is little chemistry between McConaughey and Parker, and the side stories are a bit too silly.  The film has an uneven feel to it, almost as if the B-story was added just to pad the running time.  There are some genuine laughs, but they are too few and far bewteen.  This is for fans of romantic comedies only.</p></body></html>

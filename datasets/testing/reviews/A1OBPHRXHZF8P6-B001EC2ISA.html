<meta name="summary" content="They got more than they expected for out in the country"></head><body><p>When Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam(Alec Baldwin) Maitland move out into the country, they have rest and relaxation on their mind. Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) fancies herself an artist, but husband Charles (Jeffery Jones) just wants to relax in the country after having survived stressful city life. Both he and gothic daughter Lydia (Winnona Ryder) are the most likeable ones in this family.<br /><br />After their own attempts at the supernatural fail, the Maitlands call up Beetlejuice, a disgruntled former bureaucrat for the living impaired. Because their caseworker will not help them get rid of the Detzes, the Maitlands soon turn to Beetlejuice for assistance. The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big. During the supernatural ceremony he puts on an attitude of being in charge 'until something goes wrong'. Since it's likely that he was reading this ceremony as he went along, Otho had not known what he was doing. In other films, this would be dangerous for everybody within a close radius, but Beetlejuice comes to save the day.<br /><br />Michael Keaton steals the show as a fast/smooth-talking demon. He's not an angel, but you definitely want him on your side when the chips are down. The only thing he is really scared of is sandworms (in the otherworld). Keaton would later continue to work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.<br /><br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note. The Maitlands and the Detzes end up living together in the same house and Lydia actually gets along with the former couple.</p></body></html>

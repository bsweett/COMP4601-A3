<meta name="summary" content="Solid sequel, but inferior to the original"></head><body><p>Making a sequel is very easy and also very hard; it's easy in the aspect that you already have a basic idea to follow, but hard that when you make a sequel to a classic you are bound to fail. Halloween II though for the most part gets it right. While in my opinion Halloween II is far inferior to the original it's still in its own right a solid flick and better than most 80s slasher films.<br /><br />The interesting thing is how this movie almost never came to be. Originally Halloween was meant to be a one shot deal sort of. There was never meant to be a sequel with Michael. John Carpenter wanted to take the series in a very different direction. Make a few sequels with a new plot each time. But with a lot of money on the line the powers that be first wanted a direct sequel with Michael. A lawsuit was gonna be filed forcing John Carpenter and Debra Hill to return, than it got to the point to where the movie was gonna be made with or without them. So might as well end the Michael Myers plot and get paid as well.<br /><br />John Carpenter and Debra Hill return to write the screenplay and both produced the movie as well. The script is fairly good it's nothing brilliant, but overall well done. As much I love the original it's probably my favorite horror movie of all time, the script was a little weak in some areas. It was Carpenter the director that made it so brilliant. The idea here is interesting. Halloween II starts where the last one left off. And also I have to say it does feel like it's the same night. Many times in sequels if it's the same night or even next day it feels like time elapsed, but not here.<br /><br />But there is a slight problem; the original was so great because the story was simple, and the plot for Halloween II is a direct continuation of the last. So around the 20-min mark things to slow down a little bit. As great as Halloween was and still is actually the plot is simple and can only work for so long. Overall the script is well written though, but also times a rehash.<br /><br />Donald Pleasence returns as Dr. Loomis and once again does a great job. What I love about the guy is he can play a dramatic role, but also play an over the top role and not be afraid to ham it up. Here Pleasence once again is excellent, but only problem is he does the same thing here as he did in the original, and a lot of his dialogue seems like something from the original script that was cut out. But being the great actor he is Pleasence sells it and is a blast to watch. Jamie Lee Curtis is also back and really doesn't have much to do this time around. For a majority of the movie she's in a hospital bed until the final act. With little to do Jamie Lee still delivers an excellent performance.<br /><br />Rick Rosenthal makes his directorial debut and it was quite solid. What happened to this guy? Almost everything he's done since hasn't been very good with a couple of exceptions. Following up Halloween isn't an easy thing to do and to his credit Rosenthal makes a fairly creepy and even suspenseful movie. Not everything he does though works quite well. The original had great pacing. Every scene further advanced that movie and quite honestly the scariest scenes were ones with Michael just watching and stalking. From beginning, middle to end Carpenter had the audience on the edge of their seat and that is why it's so scary.<br /><br />Halloween II also features a lot of shots of Michael walking around trying to avoid capture and than later on the hospital and while these scenes do have a creepy tone to them they don't work nearly as well as they did in the original. The pacing here can lag at times it's mostly in the middle sections when the story starts to dry up, but a kill scene will get you right back into it. What worked so brilliantly in the original doesn't work fully as well here, but still gets the job done overall.<br /><br />The final act though is excellent and very creepy and suspenseful. While not as strong as the original it very much gets the job done and is bound to have the viewer hanging in suspense. The opening act is excellent and the middle sections do lag just a bit, but it's never boring. But the final act steps it up a notch and turns Halloween II from a good and semi-creepy movie to an excellent and creepy movie.<br /><br />John Carpenter did do some re-shoots since he felt the movie was lacking a little bit. I don't know all the scenes Carpenter shot, but if anything they did more help than harm. By 1981 the slasher film was in full bloom and when you trace the history of the slasher film 1981 was the golden year. After that there were still some good ones, but it was starting to fall a part. Due to more violent slashers with such a high body count what worked so well in the original wouldn't work as well at this point and again you cannot recreate the original it's one of a kind. H20 tried that and in my opinion very much failed at that. So I think Carpenter did the right thing.<br /><br />Overall Halloween II is an excellent if not inferior sequel, but it gets the job done. Rick Rosenthal does a good job even if his scenes aren't as creepy as the original. But he does a fine job and the scenes Carpenter shot also work well. While Halloween II may not be as good as the original, it's a solid and creepy flick.</p></body></html>

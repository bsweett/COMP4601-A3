<meta name="summary" content="Good Sequel to Get Shorty"></head><body><p>'Be Cool' continues the Hollywood adventures of Chili Palmer, played by John Travolta.  The story starts in 'Get Shorty,' in which Chili moved west to Los Angeles while following one of his clients that skipped on debt owed to Chili, a former loan shark.  While in LA, Chili, a fan of classic movies, got into the movie business.  Now, in 'Be Cool,' Chilie has begun to tire of the movie business and attempts to break into the music business after a friend, played by James Woods, that happens to be a producer in the business, gets gunned down by Russian gangsters.<br /><br />This movie, like 'Get Shorty,' is adapted from the novel of the same name by Elmore Leonard.  In many ways, this movie is better than the novel.  For one thing, Chili and company have much more direction in the movie.  They don't sit around waiting for things to happen, or waiting to see how things will turn out.  In the novel, Chili got into the music business just to get ideas for a new movie.  Not so in the movie.<br /><br />There are some other differences between the novel and the movie that contribute to the movies success.  For one, Linda Moon, played by Christina Milian, is a white rock star in the novel, and a black pop artist in the movie.  This was a good change for the movie because it kept things more focused and it was easier to bring the movie up to date.  Some roles, such as Sin Lasalle (Cedric the Entainer) that were minimal, or nonexistent, in the novel have been expanded to worthy additions for the movie.<br /><br />'Be Cool' is wonderfully self referential.  Take note at the beginnning of the movie when Chili is in his car talking about movies, specifically the difference between an R rated film and a PG-13 rated film, and how many times the F word can be used.  Then count the number of times it is and check the rating of the movie.  Also, make special note of the conversations with Steven Tyler of Aerosmith as he discusses what a rock star would and would not need to do.<br /><br />Overall, 'Be Cool' is a worthy successor to 'Get Shorty,' but not quite as good.  It suffers from some of the complained of deficiencies of sequels that Leonard voiced in his novel.  Uma Thurman has a fun role (which is somewhat unusual for her as of late), and is a great addition to the film.  The Rock fans should get a good laugh out of his performance as Eliot Wilhelm, who just won't come out and admit he is gay.  Vince Vaughn turns in a great performance as a wannabe gangster/manager that pretends he is black.<br /><br />Leonard fans and fans of 'Get Shorty' should enjoy 'Be Cool.'  Travolta fans should be pleased as well.  Don't expect a comedy that will have you falling out of your seat laughing.  Make sure to check out the DVD extras, especially the gag/blooper reel.<br /><br />Overall:  4.25 stars</p></body></html>

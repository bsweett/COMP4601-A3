<meta name="summary" content="Good action flick"></head><body><p>I found Will Smith's acting to be a little overdone but other than that, this is a good action film.  Smith's tough guy swagger reminded me of John Travolta's walk in Saturday Night Fever.  It was totally out of place but I should note that he is still growing as an film artist and developing his talents.  This is a CGI driven film and those effects do not fail to please.<br /><br />Smith's role is one of a homocide detective that hates robots.  His job is to investigate a murder that he suspects has been committed by a robot.  Robots are programmed with the 3 laws (see the film) so it's inconceivable to folks that a robot could have committed murder.<br /><br />It's a nice murder mystery type of film with a twist.  The usual warnings about robots apply.The special effects are great.<br /><br />Parental advisory:  There is a small bit of nudity but no sexual situations.  There is a small amount of foul language and plenty of violence.  I suggest a viewing age of at least 13.</p></body></html>

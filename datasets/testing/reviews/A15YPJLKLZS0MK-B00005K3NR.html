<meta name="summary" content="Stephen King"></head><body><p>It's about this guy who asks a girl to prom as a joke. She has telekinesis. John Trovolta makes an appearance. The opening sequence sees Carrie White having her period in the gym shower and when her class mates throw tampons at her they all get detention. Though well acted,  it doesn't deliver many scares. Worth a rental or two.</p></body></html>

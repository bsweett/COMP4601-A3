<meta name="summary" content="Friday The 13th Part 3 (1982)"></head><body><p>Seems as though the fans of the whole Friday The 13th franchise can never get enough. In 1982, director Steve Miner brought us another sequel entitled, Friday The 13th Part 3, Steve Miner's second turn in directing a Friday The 13th film, his first being 1981's Friday The 13th Part 2.<br /><br />  In this horrifying chapter, which starts off by showing what happened at the end of the second film, Jason (played by Richard Brooker) goes on to feed on more victims. Now, this sequel is sort of a continuation of the last film, just like Halloween 2 continued on from the first Halloween. First, Jason stumbles onto a married couple named Harold and Edna. Harold is an insecure man, who allows his b*tch of a wife order him around. Edna watches the news and find out about the murders from the second film (when this film is actually taking place only a day after the second film). At that moment, Harold comes running into the house to "make a call to nature". He finishes his bathroom business, but he hears a strange noise coming from outside the bathroom door. He opens the door and Jason knocks him off, where Jason then kills Edna.<br /><br />  The next morning, a van pulls up into a nice looking neighborhood. Inside the van are Chris Higgins (played by Dana Kimmell), Debbie (played by Tracie Savage), Andy (Jeffrey Rogers), Shelley (played by Larry Zerner), and potheads, Chuck (played by David Katims) and Chili (played by Rachel Howard). They are on their way to Chris' family cabin in Camp Crystal Lake for the weekend. Right now, they're stopping to pick up Vera Sanchez (played by Catherine Parks), a girl who is going along as a date for Shelley. Shelley is very insecure about his looks and weight. In order for him to get people to like him, he has to scare the ever-loving sh*t out of them.<br /><br />  The friends pull up to the cabin, where Chris is greeted by her boyfriend, Rick (played by Paul Kratka). After another Shelley-scaring-the-hell-out-everyone joke, Vera and Shelley drive off to the grocery store to get some food for the weekend, where they have a run-in with three bikers named, Ali (played by Nick Savage), Loco (played by Kevin O'Brien), and Fox (played by Gloria Charles). Shelley pays them back with revenge, but not before the bikers follow them back to the cabin, where they plan to set the kids' barn on fire. Before they even have a chance to burn the place, Jason takes care of business with the three of them.<br /><br />  That night, Chris and Rick go for a long ride, just to catch up on things. Chris hasn't seen Rick for two years, since she hadn't gone back until now. Her reason: she was attacked by Jason and nearly killed by him. As she tells Rick the story of her terrifying ordeal, their car breaks down, `causing them to walk back to the cabin.<br /><br />  At the cabin, Debbie and Andy have a little fun in the sac, until Debbie goes to get a shower. Andy goes for a beer, but is evilly greeted by Jason. Debbie finishes her shower and goes to bed, but she is then killed by Jason. Shelley again scares the crap out of Vera, this time where an old goalie mask. He goes off into the barn, all hurt from the way Vera yelled at him. But Shelley does not come back out; Jason comes out, wearing the goalie mask. He finds Vera and shows her how to play darts with just her left eye.<br /><br />  Chuck and Chili also greet their demise. Chris and Rick return, but Rick is suddenly killed by Jason. Chris is all alone to battle Jason. She battles him in the barn. As she battles Jason, Ali suddenly appears to be alive. He tries to help Chris out, but Jason really finishes him off. As he kills Ali, Chris grabs an axe and jams it into Jason's forehead. He drops down to the ground and appears to be dead. It is then where Chris realizes that Jason is the one who attacked her all those years ago.<br /><br />  Chris then goes off into a canoe and falls asleep. She wakes up and is relieved to find that morning has arrived. She finds Jason still alive and is running after her. As she tries to sail away with the canoe, she finds that she was only hallucinating. But at that moment, Mrs. Voorhees' dead body jumps up out of the lake and grabs Chris violently and pulls her underneath the water. But Chris is lucky to find that it was only dream. Chris is unlucky in the fact that she has gone completely mental from this whole ordeal.<br /><br />  I told you twice before: no more camping until Jason is finished having his fun. But watch Friday The 13th Part 3, if you've enjoyed the first two films.</p></body></html>

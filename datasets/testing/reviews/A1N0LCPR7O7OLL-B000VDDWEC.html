The script is strong dialogue wise although it completely ripped off scenes from other movies (i.e. dawn of the dead and day of the dead).  What made the film for me though no matter what bad things I could say about it is the three central characters are so likeable, we care about them so much that movie works...Easily.  This is one of those films where the cast really carries it all the way through.  Boyle really lucked out in that respect.  There are indeed a few suspenseful scares though regardless of what the other reviewers might say...And I have seen quite a few scary movies.  Not sure how I feel about the ending yet but overall this is a highly entertaining film worth a rental.</p></body></html>

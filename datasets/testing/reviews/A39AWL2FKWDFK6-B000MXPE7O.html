<meta name="summary" content="The genesis of the CIA"></head><body><p>The Robert DeNiro directed "The Good Shepherd" was an overly ambitious, 167 minute film that chronicled the formulation of the CIA through the eyes of the humorless Edward Wilson played by Matt Damon.  Damon playing the eventual CIA head of counter intelligence was one of a star studded cast that couldn't save this plodding film which could have been cropped by at least 30 minutes.  Not only was the film editing questionable but the musical score often times drowned out the dialogue.  The characters were not particularly well developed diminishing their ability to evoke empathy for them.  Venerable veteran actors like Joe Pesci, Timothy Hutton and DeNiro himself were given toothless cameos that didn't showcase their abilities.<br /><br />DeNiro who also starred in the film as General Bill Sullivan, a prominent architect of the CIA, used a flashback format to weave his tale.  Damon seen in the film's present, 1961, takes partial responsibility for the Cuban Bay of Pigs fiasco.  We are then time warped back to the late 1930's to Damon's induction into Yale University's prestigious Skull and Bones fraternal order.  His privileged background allows him to travel in the upper echelons of society.  He is soon recruited by FBI agent Sam Murach played by Alec Baldwin to spy on his thesis professor Fredericks played by Michael Gambon who is sympathetic to Nazism.<br /><br />Soon after being cajoled into marriage as a result of a sexual fling resulting in pregnancy with loose society girl Clover Russell played by a miscast Angelina Jolie, Damon enlists with the intelligence arm of the military. He spends 6 years in Europe separated from his wife and son running the O.S.S. in London ably assisted by John Turturro playing Ray Brocco. On and on the story goes.  The O.S.S. becomes the CIA and Damon rises in the ranks of the intelligence hierarchy.<br /><br />The central theme to the story is Damon's dedication to the service and his country while eschewing his family.  What goes around comes around as Damon's son, Edward Jr. now grown up and played by Eddie Redmayne also joins the CIA putting Damon in the crosshairs of his Soviet counterpart Ulysses played by Oleg Shtefanko.</p></body></html>

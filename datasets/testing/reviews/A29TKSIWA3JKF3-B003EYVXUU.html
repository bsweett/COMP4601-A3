Except for the cast, language, and a title improvement, there isn't much of a variation between these two films to warrant a remake.<br />A glutton for punishment, I've watched both (and given both away afterwards).<br />I found both films haunting and was overwhelmed by a lingering sadness from each.  I preferred the American title only because it made more sense.  I also loved the score by Michael Giacchino in the American version.  I thought the cinematography by Greig Fraser was brilliant.  The cast couldn't be improved on, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Elias Koteas were all heartbreaking in their performances.<br />Now comes the dilemma.  On one hand, I applaud the artistry that went into both films but on the other hand, I can't say I actually enjoyed watching either, nor do I ever want to see either of them again.  So how to I rate this version?  It's well made but I didn't like it.  It's one thing to appreciate art for what it is, quite another thing to have it hanging in your home.  In this case, I'll err on the side of art.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Welcome back, John McClane"></head><body><p>You would need a pretty good team in place to justify a fourth film in a franchise that hasn't had a new entry in 13 years, and boy, do they ever have one here with director Len Wiseman at the helm.  There's nothing groundbreaking about it; rather, it's a throwback to the action films of the 80's.  Once again, Bruce Willis as John McClane pulls off stunts that would do Captain America proud but with plenty of bruises and blood stains to show for it.  The plot concerns a computer terrorist who has seized control of the United States infrastructure and once it gets going, it's non-stop action from start to finish.  I'm not sure what sets this film apart from so many other action films that just become tiresome before the final explosions detonate, but I found it to be a hugely entertaining adrenaline rush and a more fitting send-off to this character than the tepid "Die Hard with a Vengeance."</p></body></html>

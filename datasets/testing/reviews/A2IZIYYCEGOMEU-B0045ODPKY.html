<meta name="summary" content="A GREAT ACTION MOVIE"></head><body><p>I'm far from a fan of Jolie's, but I found her to be extremely convincing in SALT, and despite a slightly implausible plot,  Noyce kept the action revved-up, and in-your-face, throughout. There are lapses in logic involving certain key scenes, though nothing as blatantly, far-fetched as  most of the 'plot' in THE EXPENDABLES ( which was still a very fun movie, by the way- mostly because of it's line-up of action stars ), but the fight choreography, and car chases were very solid. All in all, it's a more than descent adrenaline-rush of a pic.</p></body></html>

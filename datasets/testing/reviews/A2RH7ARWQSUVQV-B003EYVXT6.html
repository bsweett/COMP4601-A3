I watched the last part of it on HBO and was intrigued as to how a DNA splicing could produce a creature that appeared to be 70% woman, 15% cat, 5% rabbit and 10% bird.  I watched and even rewatched the first part of the film but must admit that the science was a bit thin.  Of course, this is characteristic of all Science-Horror films.<br /><br />My guess is that, if it were possible to 'splice' all these species together, it would look a lot like the slugs that these brilliant scientists originally produced.</p></body></html>

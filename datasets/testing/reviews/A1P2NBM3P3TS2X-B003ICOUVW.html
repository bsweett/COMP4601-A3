Some of the editing/scene transitions are choppy and hastily done.  Looks like a rush job due to some last-minute meddling.<br /><br />Skip it.<br /><br />The changing-into-the-wolf effects are not even one bit more interesting than what we saw 28 years ago in "An American Werewolf in London".  In fact, in "The Wolfman" we see hands and feet and the face change, but little else.  Not that "more is better", necessarily, but it seemed more perfunctory than anything else.<br /><br />Skip it.</p></body></html>

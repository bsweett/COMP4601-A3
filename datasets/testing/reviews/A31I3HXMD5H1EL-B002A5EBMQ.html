<meta name="summary" content="Once Upon a Time, there were 3 Little Girls..."></head><body><p>As much a tribute to pop culture as a big-screen version of the '70s<br />series, 'Charlie's Angels' has so much energy and tongue-in-cheek<br />charm that it DARES you NOT to root for its three young stars! And<br />while the film won't erase the images of Farrah Fawcett in a thin<br />tanktop on a very cold day, there is a wholesome sexiness and<br />accessiblity in Barrymore, Diaz, and Liu that none of the various<br />teamings of TV 'Angels' ever achieved!  <p>The pre-title sequence is<br />outrageous, and fabulous! ...  <p>Each Angel has a unique<br />backstory...Natalie (Diaz) is an ditzy, upbeat 'Soul Train'-dancing<br />wannabe who 'shakes her booty' at home in Spider-Man undies, looks for<br />'Mr. Right', and is a crack driver; Alex (Liu) is a 'leg waxer'/extra<br />on an action movie set, who is a lousy cook, sleeps with the film's<br />star (Matt LeBlanc, in a funny cameo), and is an expert in technology<br />and martial arts; Dylan (Barrymore) is an ex-high school 'bad<br />girl'/free spirit involved with a seedy, insecure hippie living in a<br />tugboat (humorously portrayed by Tom Green, Barrymore's real-life<br />boyfriend), is a master of disguise, and leads the trio. <p>As in the<br />TV series, the Angels work out of the Townsend Detective Agency (still<br />located in the famous colonial brick building), and communicate with<br />the never-seen Charlie (voiced, as always, by John Forsythe) via the<br />telephone. As the trio's liason, Bosley, Bill Murray is simply<br />perfect, hilarious in his patented 'smarmy but lovable' persona!<br /><p>The plot revolves around the kidnapping of a Bill Gates-type<br />computer genius (Sam Rockwell, 'The Green Mile'), and a technology<br />that can pinpoint any person's location, anywhere in the world. The<br />prime suspects are competitor Roger Corwin (Tim Curry, in a<br />delightfully wicked turn!), and his hitman, portrayed with kinky<br />relish by Crispin Glover. Hired by Kelly Lynch (who has a ball in the<br />role of Rockwell's partner!), the Angels embark on a case with all the<br />twists, betrayals, action, humor, and mayhem that a fan could ask for!<br /><p>Loud, good-natured, and pulsating with a soundtrack of '70s-'80s<br />Top Ten songs, the film combines 'Matrix'-style freeze-frames and<br />slow-motion FX with a ton of Pop Culture references and a<br />swashbuckling sense of derring-do! The film literally rocks, and never<br />lets up! <p>Is this 'Great Cinema'? Certainly not! But in its sheer<br />audacity, and sense of fun, no recent film can match it! And while the<br />original series teased with a visual sex appeal that was was largely<br />ignored in the storylines, the big-screen version has a 'if you got<br />it, flaunt it' attitude that is both refreshing and empowering! This<br />is a 'Girl Power' movie, in the BEST sense of the word! <p>I HIGHLY<br />recommend it!</p></body></html>

The water is literally an apartment swimming pool, but is really the blue world that is Earth.  The story of this movie is relationship between the apt superintendent and Story.  She rescues him from drowning at the beginning of the movie, he then rescues her from the wolf.  Later she sees into his troubled heart and rescues his soul by giving someone to care for again; her.  At the end he rescues her by assembling the apartment residents into a team that helps her get back to her world.  The plot plays out very easily with few twists.  The characters, like those in Shamalayan's other movies, are normal in most ways except with special gifts that are revealed only at the end.  The visual editing is different from other movies, with a lot of slow-motion shots, up-close shots, etc...  The DVD itself does not have many extra features, and really does not add insight into what the director was thinking.  Overall, an entertaining movie, but not great.</p></body></html>

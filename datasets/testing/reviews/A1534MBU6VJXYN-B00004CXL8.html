That was box office hype at its worst, as the film only won because it was this gargantuan box office hit. Had this film flopped, then there's no doubt in my mind that either "Good Will Hunting" or this brilliant comedy would have won Best Picture. Far better than that film that should have sank like the ship it was named for, "As Good As It Gets" is wihtout a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Of course, since it was written by comedy mastermind James L. Brooks ("Terms Of Endearment", "The Mary Tyler Moore Show", "The Simpsons"), you can't expect anything less than a comedic work of art (though "Spanglish" was little underwhelming).<br /><br />Jack Nicholson quite possibly the finest performance of his career as novelist Melvin Udall, a rude (to put it mildly), middle aged man with an extreme case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder who's going through a serious writer's block/mid-life crisis. He is the most unlikable man in New York City, with no compssion for animals, women or his homosexual neighbor (a perfectly cast Greg Kinear) and his art dealer friend Frank (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). He bring hiw own silverwear to his favorite restaurant in town, where he must be served by his favorite waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt), who even he treats rudely. However, something changes. When his neighbor is beaten up by vicious thugs, Melvin is forced to watch his beloved dog. Though uneasy at first, Melvin and the dog become great friends. In fact, when his real owner comes home, the dog prefers to stay with Melvin (the scene where Kinear impersonates Nicholson is priceless). Melvin is starting to develope feelings for Carol as well. The problem is, she's too busy caring for her son to take notice - plus she doesn't like him anyway. As the film unfolds, a trip upstate ties everything together, as all the characters become better people - including Melvin.<br /><br />This film is one of the true films in cinema that can be considered perfect. The writing is on the money, the directing is excellent and all the performances were top notch (Nicholson and Hunt deserved their Oscars, and Kinear and Gooding were great as well). The audio comentary was good (it was nice to hear the somewhat reclusive Nicholson offer his intake), and the film is a true must have movie.</p></body></html>

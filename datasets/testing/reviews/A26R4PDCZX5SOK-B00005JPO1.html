Really nice to have Indiana Jones back after two decades. Older, smarter and a bit slower, but, still the Indy we all know and love. The movie opens with the Russians (oh, we're in the 1950's now) trying to break-into Area 51 to recover an artifact. They've brought Jones as a hostage and to find the artifact in the storage warehouse. From there, we're on a typical Indie quest. I can tell you that there is a Crystal Skull (or two) involved. We do see the return of Marian (Karen Allen) as Indie's lost girlfriend. There are other surprises in this movie.<br /><br />Expertly crafted and on par with all three previous Indie movies.Richly photographed, great sets, great action and fun chases. I have added this movie to my list of favorites and highly recommend it! This is a two bag-of-popcorn feature movie! Let's hope for more adventures in the future.</p></body></html>

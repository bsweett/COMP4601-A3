A reimagining of the 1968 classic "Planet of the Apes," Burton would use the same concept and put a different twist on things. Major Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) has to recapture a lost monkey pilot who was testing out a space pod, but unfortunately, he got sucked into a time funnel. While traveling into the distant future and crash landing on a planet ruled by apes, Davidson had to fight authority. He gathered a group of humans to rebel against the mean General Thade (Tim Roth) and regain equality. An ape with the name Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) believed the humans were being mistreated and helped them fight. The battle sequence that involved Davidson's spaceship blasting the apes away was forever genius. I have never laughed so hard seeing monkeys fly. Even Donkey Kong would've thought that was funny. Silly monkeys! Even though this movie doesn't surpass the original, it's still worth a look.</p></body></html>

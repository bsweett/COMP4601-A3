Without a doubt Tom Cruise will be nominated and most likely win the best actor Oscar (Denzel got one for a much more basic bad-guy role) for his role as the cool and dangerous hitman named Vincent. Foxx should at least get nominated for a supporting role, because he proves to everyone that he can hold his own with Cruise. Without these two casting choices the movie wouldn't be half as good. The plot is a little thin and predictable at times, but the dialogue is written very well and the direction is tight. The action scenes (mainly Tom kicking butt) aren't gory, but they are brutal and fast much as they would be in a real fight with a trained killer delivering the blows. The realism of the film adds much more depth and some of the time I completely forgot I was watching a hollywood made movie. Kudos to all involved and thanks Micheal Mann for reviving the thriller/suspense genre in such a stylish way.</p></body></html>

My relative who lives with us has this and House of 1000 Corpses on DVD so I just borrowed it to watch it. Well good thing I don't buy these because although there's a certain entertainment factor that's crucial in a film which this film has, it's also marred by bad dialogue and a feeling of just plodding its way to its conclusion, rather than build tension or memorable scenes.<br /><br />It's essentially a sequel of sorts to House, which was an absolutely bad film. In that film we root for the kids to make it out alive only they don't. Similar to Freddy or Jason, we end up rooting for the killer(mainly because the actors in those films were bad). Here, it's obvious we're supposed to root for the Firefly family only if they get killed off we're like "hm, no more movies then".<br /><br />Basically, cops raid the Firefly home, leaving one killed and another captured. 2 escape, daughter Baby and son Otis. They take some hostages which of course are dispensed with(one of them really dispensed with), they then meet up with Captain Spaulding, the dad. On their tail is the Chief, chasing after them mainly because they killed his brother.<br /><br />After Pulp Fiction came out, many films were accused of having its dialogue/tone "Tarantino-esque". No more is this evident than Rob's films. Like Corpses, many dialogue is trying to be witty and funny but it sounds like a kid who's learned how to swear so he's being creative by mixing them up. There's literally a dialogue exchange like this: "**** you. **** me? **** you, mother****er!" Good dialogue like that is hard to come by folks.<br /><br />One thing that is thankfully exercised from Corpses is the processing trickery such as having negatives and color overexposed or degraded. There is use of that freeze frame from the last one but at least here it's used to better effect. If Corpses was trying to be a splatterhouse film, Rejects is trying to be spaghetti-western/horror which oddly reminds me of From Dusk Till Dawn.<br /><br />If you're into Rob's films, the genre or you just like it, then pick it up but personally a horror movie should creep you out, not make you laugh in the wrong way.</p></body></html>

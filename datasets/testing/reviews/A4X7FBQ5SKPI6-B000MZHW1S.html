<meta name="summary" content="Leo is a great actor, but that is about it"></head><body><p>Sure, ya ok i cannot knock this cast or the performances that lie within.  Pretty political though, i mean c'mon, Africa was in turmoil and war long before any of us were even around, let alone the United States.  Suddenly out of nowhere the United States is the only place in the world that buys diamonds, ya ok sure whateva.  Set in a true time period but severely marred otherwise.  I mean, c'mon people, you really think the whole airship diversion would happen?  and the whole thing with posing as journalists was absurd.  America also dumps millions into this country and year and, well like they said, nothing changes.  the kids get recruited, the people starve and then the blame gets pinpointed in all the wrong places.  When will the zombies wake up and realize that the only person africa has to blame for its problems, is africa?  Blood Diamond has great actors but a pathetic storyline that has nothing more than the intention of laying blame in all the wrong places.  I know, I lived there for three years and I worked for Unicef and IAD Homes.  Drop 10,000 marines in there with orders to sweep and salvage and I can assure ya that the rebels will not kill another woman or child.  instead we get movies from hollywood that, like babel and syriana try to paint some tunnel vision for the zombies to get fixated on.  Diamonds and greed are not the problem, the problem is this country has not progressed one inch in the last thousand years.  Go ahead, give my review a negative hit, see if I care.  I care for the people of Africa, I just wish everyone else would wake up and get to the root of the problem instead of try to isolate non existent problems with fictional tales of trouble.</p></body></html>

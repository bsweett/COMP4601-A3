<meta name="summary" content="Not bad as it seem....."></head><body><p>Actually rating should be 3.5 stars. This movie is strictly what is considered as a "popcorn flick". Make sure you check your brain at the door if you wished to enjoy this movie. Since this movie is not reality based, there would be no reason why it should not have a comic book feel to the entire film.<p>The computer graphics did a good job recreating all the classical monsters like the werewolf and if there was any real complaint, that it was too much CGI work. The story was super thin and dialogue was best kept simple as the story - which have Van Helsing going to battle Dracula and his minions. Hugh Jackson does a good job here soldiering on for God and Church against the forces of evil. Kate Beckinsale wasn't too bad and Dave Wenham who was badly miscast in Return of the King was actually pretty good here as a fiar, Brother Carl. While not as good his Mummy movies, I thought the director, Stephen Sommers did well. The ending surprised me a bit but I can feel a sequel coming if this movie make big bucks.<p>Part James Bond, part Indiana Jones and all made up, this may be a good movie to have a party around. It may scared little kids but grown should have fun with it. Don't take it seriously and it should be enjoyable.</p></body></html>

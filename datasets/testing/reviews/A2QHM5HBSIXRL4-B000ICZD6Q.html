<meta name="summary" content="Paul Weitz's winning streak continues"></head><body><p>I'm not sure how much attention we can pay to the 'official' amazon review pasted above here, given that Dennis Quaid's character is referred to as 'Dave Foreman.'  In this character-driven, conversational movie, Quaid's Dan Foreman is addressed as Dan no fewer than 50 times.<br /><br />That aside, this is good film, certainly one of the better ones that 'gets' the work environment, circa 2005.  Weitz focuses on the human side of the crazed pace of mergers and acquisitions.  There's a cost involved, and often it's not pretty.  That's embodied here in some good performances, most notably by the always outstanding David Paymer...a good man caught in a numbers game.  Topher Grace is also outstanding...his caffeine-fueled rant about "Synergy" (the film's original working title) starts in a halting, nervous fashion and escalates into highfalutin grabs at the opportunities of marrying the Sports America and Krispity Krunch brands.  He's almost convinced himself by the end of it.<br /><br />This speech is echoed later in an uncredited performance by Malcolm McDowell as the rapacious Teddy K (who I'll say looks to be a cross between Teddy Forstman and Rupert Murdoch, even though the story line itself closely resembles the events of 'new media' giant AOL's takeover of Time Warner).<br /><br />In both cases, it's Quaid/Foreman who calls the bluff on synergy.  Quaid's character does business the old-fasioned way: based on relationships.  As a filmmaker, Weitz takes the time to show you the bonds he tries to build with auto-parts entrepreneur Phillip Baker Hall.<br /><br />Weitz's winning streak continues here.  Everyone (especially obsessive Nick Hornby fans like myself) doubted he could break free from his 'American Pie' roots to adapt Hornby's 'About A Boy' for the big screen.  Not only did he succeed, it was *better* than the book...which is really saying something.</p></body></html>

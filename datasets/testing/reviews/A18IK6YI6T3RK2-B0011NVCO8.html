Denzel Washington is fantastic as ever, he exudes power and he is very believeable as this nefarious Harlem capitalist.  Crowe was very good as well, he can do just about any role and he is as good as Washington in this, if not better.  I had wished Scott had included more one on one moments with Crowe and Washington, it was sort of like the movie, Heat, with Pacino and De Niro having like ten minutes together in a three hour movie.  I was pleased to see that Ruby Dee got any Academy Award nomination for her role in this, she was great; it reminded me of her heartbreaking role in Jungle Fever.  The extended version gives a slightly longer ending; it provides for some more screen time between Crowe and Washington, but frankly it feels added on, like it was an afterthought.  This is a powerful movie, based on real events and it resonates.</p></body></html>

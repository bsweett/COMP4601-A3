<meta name="summary" content="A FASCINATING THRILLER!"></head><body><p>"The Forgotten" is a fascinating sci-fi thriller where the horror is psychological instead of phyisical, and the enemy is not defeated by physical force, but by a Mother's love! Julianne Moore gives an exciting and emotional performance. Gary Sinise, Dominic West and Alfre Woodard give great performances in supporting roles.<br /><br />"The Forgotten" ranks right up there with "The Sixth Sense" and "Signs" as one of the creepiest thrillers of all time! Fans of the genre will not be disappointed! Movie/DVD Grade: A-</p></body></html>

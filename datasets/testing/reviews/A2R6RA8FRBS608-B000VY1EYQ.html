<meta name="summary" content="a slice of pie--or a slice of life?"></head><body><p>Waitress is indeed a frank, touching and sometimes painful look at how life really is for Jenna, a young woman stuck in a loveless marriage to Earl--and pregnant. Jenna has two real friends who waitress with her at the diner, Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn (Adrienne Shelly). The plot moves along at a good pace and the convincing acting impressed me very much.<br /><br />The action begins when Jenna and her friends find out (in the washroom of the diner) that Jenna is pregnant by her "I'm a not so nice guy but I'm also complicated" husband, Earl. Jenna (Keri Russell) is horrified because now she fears it will be next to impossible to escape from her abusive, egotistical, sensitive husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto). Jenna's life becomes far more complicated when she impulsively starts an affair with her gynecologist/obstetrician, Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion).<br /><br />Jenna is only happy when she makes pies or fools around with Dr. Pomatter; and she knows that her life is in trouble. She can't risk Earl finding out about her affair with the doctor--he'll kill them; and she finds escaping from her marriage to Earl ever more difficult. Earl is a needy guy and somewhat vulnerable at heart but he behaves like such a brute that you sympathize with Jenna's desire to leave him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, "Old Joe" (Andy Griffith), the crusty old owner of the diner where Jenna and her friends work, has his own realistic and complicated relationship with Jenna. While on the surface Joe bosses Jenna around and gets ridiculously fussy about his order for lunch, we eventually see a softer side to Joe and a heart of true compassion that is very touching.<br /><br />Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. Will Jenna play it safe and remain miserable in her marriage to Earl? Will Earl ever find out about her affair with her doctor? What about the other two waitresses--Dawn and Becky--how will things go for them? No spoilers here, folks, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out.<br /><br />The cinematography is very well done in the diner scenes; and the choreography works well in the wedding scene, too.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a number of extras. There's a commentary, a look at how they made this film and a touching memorial to Adrienne Shelly who was tragically murdered shortly after the film was finished.<br /><br />Waitress is a very good film. It gives us an honest and refreshing look at life in a way we don't frequently see. We see people making good and bad decisions; and ultimately the film leaves you with an important message about life. I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

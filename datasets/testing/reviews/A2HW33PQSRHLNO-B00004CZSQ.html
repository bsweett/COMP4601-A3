<meta name="summary" content="one of the best horror movies of all time"></head><body><p>this movie is so powerful and hypnotic that i find it hard to imagine exaggerating it's importance to the horror genre and film as a whole.  although i was appalled by the violence in it and have trouble understanding people who like argento's work solely for the brutal and repugnant scenes of misogyny and over the top murder, every other aspect of this movie was damn near perfect.  it something of a puzzle, truly a paradox and a fascinating one to reflect on:something i can't quite articulate about it prevents it from being an empty exercise in style and gives it substance, be it not of an intellectual or moral kind. if you describe this movie to most people they will shrug their shoulders and say, &quot;sounds like a cheesy, stupid horror movie.&quot; and indeed the plot sounds so absurd (a dance school run by a coven of witches), that before seeing the movie we would probably think this ourselves after being told about the plot. but when you actually experience it, there is something incredibly effective and absolutely unforgettable about it, and the earnest viewer cannot doubt after one viewing that argento is nothing less than a horror movie genius in the league of tobe hooper or alfred hitchcock. a terrifying and utterly engrossing plunge into the world of the imagination and the supernatural, this movie has a surreal and otherworldly beauty that simply defies description.  argento is the ETA Hoffmann of horror films in that he can come up with the most ludicrous and laugh out loud plots and somehow allow us, through the sheer magic and overwhelming atmosphere of fear and terror, to suspend our disbelief and critical intelligence and lose ourselves in the movie.  susy banyon is a none too bright or extaordinary but strong willed and talented young woman (jessica harper's performance is a bit one dimensional and doe eyed but still memorable) who transfers to a prestigious dance school in another country and slowly discovers the terrible truth about the academy she has so eagerly decided to attend. i personally couldn't take my eyes off it from the opening scene in the airport to the last sequence where susy has an unfortunate encounter with 'mater suspiriorum'.  the soundtrack is in itself a classic and fits perfectly with the movie, and provides a perfect compliment to the dreamlike, multi colored glow of the academy's interior.  this movie is so frightening and eerie that it made a friend who i introduced to it, a film student, very uncomfortable and as i could immediately tell after about half an hour, just plain scared. this is not only a must see but an absolute necessity, not to be rented but to be bought and bought fast.  argento's later work is a joy to the horror/surrealism fan as well, but this is undeniably his best movie and the masterpiece on which his cult following rests.  the best movie he made next to &quot;suspiria&quot;, i feel, is &quot;inferno&quot;, which is a sequel (of sorts) to the latter in that it deals with &quot;the three mothers&quot; and their power over the world.  in both movies, although &quot;inferno&quot; is clearly the lesser, argento creates captivating and dreamlike world of terror and malevolent forces secretly working against unsuspecting victims who are unlucky enough to accidentally gain knowledge or awareness of these not very kind women.  buy both movies, and see all of his work.  this guy's stuff should be known to everyone.</p></body></html>

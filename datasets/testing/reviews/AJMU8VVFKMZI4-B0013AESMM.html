<meta name="summary" content="Jodie saves another one"></head><body><p>Jodie's talent saves another thinly plotted script.  How many life and death situations does an average citizen get into?  Does anyone believe that this-what 5'4 woman really beat up fully capable 6'1 or more man with a crowbar-oh and toss him over a high drop parking deck?  I like a little vigilante justice...in my Hollywood movies only, but the final moment with Terrence Howard helping her out in the end was just a bit too much.  They weren't THAT close.  Still despite being predictable, the film does deliver the suspense.  I understand the need to have dark scenes, but I hate that almost nuclear green tint these films use.  I always feel like I need a bath after watching two hours with that slimy color.  Overall The Brave One manages to entertain...because Jodie is always fascinating to watch.</p></body></html>

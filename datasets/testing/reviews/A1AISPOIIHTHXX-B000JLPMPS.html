<meta name="summary" content="One of the best westerns around? "I guess so""></head><body><p>Despite the fact he's one of the most respected actors/directors around, the films that I've seen him direct haven't really been that good for me. I despised Mystic River and I didn't get why there was so much love for Million Dollar Baby. However, most people will just end up saying "well then watch Unforgiven" so not being one to dismiss something outright, I thought sure, why not? Well I don't regret it one bit. While it's certainly a different western than others I've seen, that's kind of what makes it unique as well: a character-based study set in the West as opposed to outlaws tearing up the Wild West.<br /><br />After being ridiculed by the size of his manhood, Quick Mike cuts up a prostitute named Delilah, leaving her face scarred. Quick Mike and his partner however get punished by the town sheriff, Little Bob, by giving up some of their ponies. Outraged at the lack of severity in the punishment, the mother figure Alice gets the other women to pool their savings and offer a bounty on the 2.<br /><br />Reluctantly answering the call is William Munny, a pig farmer living with his 2 children. It's a different life for him and one he desperately needs since not only did his wife pass but he used to be a very ruthless killer once. Since the money's too good to pass up, he goes for it and along the way, he brings his buddy Ned, who's quite the sharpshooter. Only things don't go exactly as planned since not only is a no firearm policy heavily enforced but the 2 men are actually protected. For both this is not just a simple bounty and the whole thing plays out like a morality play with no clear winners.<br /><br />One thing that first hits you about the film is how untypical of a western it is. Unlike, let's say, Tombstone, this town almost seems eerily quiet and without life. There's a stillness that's new to me and I liked seeing it. Reminded me of visiting my grandparent's cabin where it was just you and nothing else. It's also perfectly shot with very lush camera shots of valleys and the skies. Also, the film doesn't really have that huge gun shootout you often see. For some, it might be disappointing since gun battles are brief and not as dynamic as say, Open Range's is or other ones. It does set the film from most other ones since there's not really a melancholy but a certain relaxed feeling or a subdued feeling rather than big dynamic Wild West gunplay.<br /><br />Acting of course is spot-on from Eastwood to Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman. While Richard Harris does do a great job in his scenes, the actual character can probably be taken out and it wouldn't do a huge blow to the film. It mainly shows what happens to people who try to go for the bounty or break the no firearm policy but it's not ultimately that important. Also, there's a young sidekick William and Ned take along with them that was so irritating I wish one of them would shoot him and say "shut up already". The pacing also might get people, since as I said, it's more subdued than the more energetic Tombstone was. Besides the might-be troublesome pacing and that annoying brat, the film's quite great regardless.<br /><br />The film in a way isn't like most Best Picture winners where they're larger-than-life and big and epic but it's also well-made with surprising direction by Eastwood and a good message concerning guns. So far it's the best Eastwood film I've seen although I haven't seen Flags or Iwo Jima yet.</p></body></html>

Rough sketches, animation tests and disembodied characters whiz by, accompanied by hip funereal music.<br /><br />The DVD featurettes don't dig into the gory details -- none last more than 7 minutes. "Lord of the Universe," a Tim Burton profile, celebrates his "black and beautiful humor." "It's a very particular place for an actor to dwell, in Tim Burton's imagination," says Emily Watson, who plays the film's flesh-and-blood heroine. Helena Bonham Carter appears here as well, as the bone-yard bride.<br /><br />Two of the shorts cover how the puppets were built (some had mechanical faces, "like Swiss watches") and how they performed. "I think Victor is a much better actor than I am," says voice star Johnny Depp.<br /><br />Danny Elfman gets a few minutes to talk up the music. "In the land of the dead, it's pretty jazzy," he says, explaining the Cab Calloway-meets-Tom Waits number he performs. (Burton agrees: "The world of the living is actually much more dead than the world of the dead.")<br /><br />Video and audio are terrific, borderline reference quality. Warner has released the film in its original widescreen format (1.85:1) and in kid-friendly full-screen.</p></body></html>

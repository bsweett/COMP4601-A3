At an United Nations Conference, climatologist Jack Hall states that in as few as a hundred or as many as a thousand years, global warming will be begin to change the Earth's climate in drastic ways.  No one pays much heed to his warning.  Only weeks later, the severe climate changes come much sooner than Hall expected, plunging the world into another Ice Age.  When Hall discovers his son is trapped in New York, he decides to march from Washington DC to NY to rescue him along with two close friends.  If you couldn't tell, the plot is more than a little predictable, but that is beside the point.  What makes this movie worthwhile are the extraordinary special effects, whether it be countless tornadoes ravaging dowtown Los Angeles or a huge tsunami-like wave flooding the streets of New York City.  Equally impressive are the shots from the space shuttle orbitting Earth of the changing face of the planet as the ice moves farther and farther south.  Don't buy this movie for the story, get it for the amazing special effects.<br /><br />  Dennis Quaid stars as climatologist Jack Hall, a scientist who must travel to New York to save his son.  Even though the science in the movie is pretty far-fetched, Quaid makes it believable when he tries to explain what is happening all over the world.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jack's son, Sam, who must try to survive in the Public Library with a small group of survivors.  Ian Holm stars as Terry Rapson, a scientist working in Scotland who believes and supports what Hall is trying to explain to the world.  Sela Ward plays Jack's wife Lucy, a doctor trying to save a young cancer patient.  The movie also stars Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, Jay O. Sanders, Austin Nichols, Arjay Smith, and Tamyln Tomita.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, two different commentary tracks, two deleted scenes, plenty of CD-ROM offers, and sound demos for eight scenes.

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Film!"></head><body><p>Highly riveting film with a super performance by both Russell Crowe and Ed Harris.  Even though the director changed John Nash's life a great deal to make it a more entertaining movie.<p>John Nash, a genius who came up with a business model that was adopted by many businesses, is a social oddball that is so dedicated to his studies that he has absolutely no concept of social skills.  He finds it a task to even make the slightest bit of conversation with a female.  The only person he seems to get along with is his college roomate (later we find out that this roomate is not what he seems).  His genius attracts a government agency that employs him briefly as a code breaker.  There he meets Ed Harris, who is not what he seems either.  Ed has him working on top secret work that involves breaking secret transmissions from the Russians.<p>Everything then starts to unravel and we learn the truth about the people that seem to influence John the most.<p>Crowe gives a super performance in probably the role he was born to play!</p></body></html>

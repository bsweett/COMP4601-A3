They've been used before, most recently in "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow." But they have never been executed with the  sophistication that directors Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarentino (who directed one scene) display in this pastiche of Miller's comic books --- err, excuse me, "graphic novels," in the parlance used today to elevate the stature of cartoonists by those unaware of the stature cartooning long ago achieved. The trilogy of Miller movies that Rodriguez plans must now be measured against this dazzling mosaic.<br /><br />It won't dazzle everyone, not with its dismemberments and disembowelments, castrations, misogyny (women are trashed or trashy), rampant immorality and corruption. But adventurers will sit transfixed by the three linked stories that pay tribute to film noir, the only way to film Miller. Violence, cynicism and outrageous behavior are his forte. All of the action, acting and direction are over the top and below the belt. "Sin City" is as sexual as anything likely to silence you in your seat this year.<br /><br />The stories are of an ailing cop (Bruce Willis) who rescues from a pervert (Nick Stahl) a pubescent girl who grows up to love him, an ugly ruffian (Mickey Rourke) who seeks the killer of a whore who loved him, and the protector (Clive Owen) of a whore (Rosario Dawson) whose gang is under attack by really bad guys. Plot points are resolved in a bath of brutality and bloodshed, exquisitely rendered in black-and-white CG images wed to live actors and accented with bright colors, mostly blood red.<br /><br />Heartthrob Josh Hartnet, a creepy Benecio del Toro and, as a cannibalistic killer, elfin Elijah Wood are in the remarkable cast. This is not an actor's movie. although Willis and Rourke give mature performances and the very British Owen is as hard-boiled as early Burt Lancaster. Rodriquez, who is inventing a genre here, has set casting, thematic and technical standards that heighten our expectations (Peter Jackson met them with his "Rings" cycle.) It is not an overstatement to say that "Sin City" is an amazing motion picture. Bizarre, but amazing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Exactly What Spiderman Should Be"></head><body><p>I'll open by saying I love this movie.<br /><br />I'll continue by adding that I don't understand why some complain about "too many villains" when that alone captures the very essence of your friendly neighborhood spider-man - he's just a busy guy!<br /><br />All the aspects of the story were powerful and compelling, and I didn't lose interest for one single moment. I loved every minute of "Spider-man 3" and I'm glad that the finished production turned out the way it did.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation of "Spider-man 3" is fantastic, both visually and acoustically.<br /><br />It's easily a favorite!</p></body></html>

I can't believe I just wrote that! (especially about a remake). Anyway, Zack Snyder sets the tone of horror right from the opening credits and maintains it through the very last end credit. This is no small task. But, hey this guy's obviously got a pair trying to remake Romero. The cast is perfect, the violence abounds and the message is chilling. Snyder keeps the viewer in a state of suspense throughout the film. Call me sadistic but I love the fact that every single one of these characters gets it in the end. What a horrifying thought, nothing but zombies roaming the earth. As for a social commentary, at this point nihilism may be the only thing left to save our sorry world from mall culture and consumerism. A must see, must own DVD for horror fans. Highest Recommendation.</p></body></html>

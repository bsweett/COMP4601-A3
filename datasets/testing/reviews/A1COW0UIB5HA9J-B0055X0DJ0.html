Bumblebee is left behind but does still follow Sam even in disguise as his friends such as Optimus Prime (Voiced by Peter Cullen) with Ratchet (Voiced by Robert Foxworth) and Ironhide (Voiced by Jess Harnell) plus other new autobots like Skids (Voiced by Tom Kenny), Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny), Mudflap, Arcee and others have had their battle with the Decepticons especially Starscream (Voiced by Charles Adler). Sam however has one of the last remaining pieces of the all-spark then something goes haywire went it's powers go into his brain making him a bit smarter, more frantic and fast paced like never before like if he had a rush of some kind especially writing weird transformers type languages on paper and some kind of supernatural ability. An ancient Decepticon named "The Fallen" (Voiced by Tony Todd) has arrived on Earth seeking revenge but while he's at it, Sam has became a target for Megatron (Voiced by Hugo Weaving) and other decepticons must seek an ancient device hidden in Egypt that can unleash doom into the world.<br /><br />Co-starring Megan Fox back as Mikaela, Isobel Lucas, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel this is a very entertaining and well paced sequel that is actually four stars. Sure some of the jokes are crude yet tasteless and weak at times including former Decepticon Jetfire (Voiced by Mark Jones) being one of those old-man jokes to even humping stuff but there is a few good hilarious moments. The acting is quite good, the action sequences are breathtaking as usual from Michael Bay as they are better than the first and amazing CGI even thought "Avatar" has the best visual effects of 2009. We get more Transformers such as Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny), Soundwave (Voiced by Frank Welker), and Skipjack (Voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) and sometimes it's a bit racist with those 2 robots being punk-hip hop stereotypes even goofy looking but annoying at times. What more can you want when you can turn off your brain and have some fun despite what lousy critics said.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray Wal Mart edition is PHENOMENAL with amazing big screen IMAX style picture and flawless sound quality like never. The extras are fantastic such as commentary, documentary called Human Factor which takes you behind the scenes, Destructing Visual Bayhem which gives you multi-angel sequences, NEST: Transformer Data Hub which tells you files of Transformers in quality 3D including history, The Blu-Ray exclusive called Allspark Experiment, 25 years of transformers featurette, deleted and alternate scenes, giant effing movie which is a semi behind the scenes montage, music video by Linkin Park and of course Trailers, TV Spots and galleries.</p></body></html>

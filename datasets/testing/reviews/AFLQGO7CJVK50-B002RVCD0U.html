<meta name="summary" content="Terminator 4"></head><body><p>This is clearly a precursor to The Sarah Conner Chronicles where people are Terminators and do not know it or are Terminators, know it, but still have emotions and old thoughts along with actual hearts and lungs, brains as well. Summer Glau does not star in this movie, however. T4 is as good or better than any of the other T movies and is action packed. Buy it if you have to mow lawns for pay!</p></body></html>

Combining the fast cars and lethal guns of modern action flicks with the mind-blowing hand-to-hand combat of classic martial arts films, The Transporter 2 delivers a thrilling roller-coaster ride of butt-kicking mayhem. The fights are superbly choreographed, and the special effects are quite litterally explosive. To make it all the better, this action I speak of is practically non-stop. Just when you think your heart might return to it's normal rate, all hell breaks loose. Simply put, Transporter 2 is a must-see film for anyone who loves a good action flick. Although it's not very realistic, it's a visual treat to any fan of the genre.</p></body></html>

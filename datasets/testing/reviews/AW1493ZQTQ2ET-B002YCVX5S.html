<meta name="summary" content="Uniquely quirky and highly entertaining"></head><body><p>This movie mixes dynamic plot, vivid scenery, over-the-top characters, shocking violence, and subtle humor in a quirky way that perhaps only Quentin Tarantino could come up with.  In that sense, this movie is very much a reincarnation of Pulp Fiction, although of course the details are all different.<br /><br />This sort of movie can't possibly appeal to everyone, as the broad spectrum of previous reviews attests, but I personally found it highly entertaining and well worth the time.  Indeed, I was so gripped by this movie - frequently wanting to know what was going to happen next but rarely able to predict it - that the time just flew by and it felt like my attention didn't even lapse for a second.  True, some of the violence is hard to watch, but the movie's pervasive aura of humor subtly reminds us that this is make-believe stuff, so that helps to soften the blow (both figuratively and literally).  And of course humor is partly a matter of taste, but I personally found myself laughing out loud many times during this movie (Brad Pitt's character is the funniest in the movie, and I think he nails the role).<br /><br />What are the general lessons from the movie?  I don't think this movie really has any serious aspirations in that direction, but every good movie still has such lessons in there somewhere, so here's my attempt to pull some out:<br /><br />(a) Before harming someone, beware of the possibility of revenge which may far exceed your harm.<br /><br />(b) Ideology can readily drive people to violence which they consider justified, along with willingness to die for a cause.<br /><br />(c) Terrorism can be disproportionately effective, particularly with respect to undermining the morale of the enemy.<br /><br />(d) Occupying a group of people is an inherently dangerous undertaking.<br /><br />(e) People tend to vacillate between allegiance to their personal interest versus the groups to which they belong.<br /><br />(f) History sometimes reaches sensitive points at which outcomes can be drastically changed by seemingly small events.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of Tarantino's previous work, and also recommended to others who want to try something different.</p></body></html>

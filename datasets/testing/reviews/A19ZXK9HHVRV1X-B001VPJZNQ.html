The Rock - officially anointing him as the action hero star for the new millennium.<br /><br />In this film, The Rock plays a wannabe restaurateur who finds himself in hock to a vicious mob boss.  To work off his debt, the rock-solid behemoth becomes a retrieval expert, strong arming other people into paying what THEY owe to the gangster.  For his final assignment, the Rock is sent off to the jungles of South America to find and bring back the boss's recalcitrant son, who is busy searching for some buried Indian treasure and making a general pest of himself.  While there, The Rock becomes involved in a small war between a gold miner who has virtually enslaved the native population (who else but Christopher Walken?) and the band of rebels out to defeat him and regain freedom for their people.<br /><br />"The Rundown" is a fairly standard action adventure film in which the ever-resilient hero is able to pulverize a whole army of armed-to-the-teeth bad guys with little more than his own bare hands and without suffering a single scratch in the process.  No matter how many times he gets punched, kicked, stomped on, thrown into the air or tossed over a cliff, The Rock always manages to pick himself up, dust himself off and fight again.  Writer R.J. Stewart and director Peter Berg make it a point to emphasize The Rock's humanity by having him rarely use a gun when fighting (and then only as a last resort) and by giving him a homey domestic dimension in the form of his culinary talents.  There's something downright incongruous about having a human side of beef beating everyone he meets into a bloody pulp, all the while declaring that he is really opposed to violence on principle.  The film is also filled with all the verbal bantering, wisecracks and quips one has come to expect from these big budget action pictures.  Some of the humor works and some of it doesn't.<br /><br />Although The Rock has yet to develop his chops as an actor, he has a certain laidback charm that works well on screen.  He is effectively paired with Seann William Scott (Stifler from the "American Pie" movies), who has a ball playing the hyper kinetic jokester who just happens to be hiding a heart of gold under his mercenary exterior.  The two develop a kind of nagging, love/hate relationship that generates a few laughs along the way.  Rosario Dawson, with her seamless, pearly white teeth and perfectly coiffed hair, is far from convincing as a woman who is a bartender by day and a jungle-dwelling revolutionary by night.  She is so grave and serious in her overall demeanor that she seems to be acting in a whole other movie entirely.<br /><br />The Rock has a long way to go before he finds a vehicle even half as good as the best that Arnold has done, but "The Rundown" has its moments.</p></body></html>

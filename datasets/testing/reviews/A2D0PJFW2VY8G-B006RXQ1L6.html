The film didn't appeal to me on its release and it's only through Mrs B that I have finally seen it. I try to approach any new film with an open mind so grabbed my dancing shoes, dusted down my underused vocal cords and headed for 1920s Chicago to see if I could figure out what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) dreams of a career in showbiz and believes she has found her lucky break in Fred Cassely who draws Roxie into an affair with the assurance of the stardom she has long craved. When Cassely turns out to be a liar, Roxie kills him on the spot and finds herself imprisoned and all set to be hanged. She shares the prison with a group of women who have taken brutal revenge against the men that have wronged them, the most prominent being club singer and media sensation, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is in prison for murdering her husband and sister following their affair. What follows is a struggle between Roxie and Velma to be the tabloid favourites while putting their faith in legendary lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), to help them win freedom and avoid the hangman's noose.<br /><br />Chicago boasts some terrific songs with my personal favourites being "Cell Block Tango" where Roxie's fellow prisoners each tell their stories and justify the killing of their partners, and "Mr Cellophane" where Roxie's husband, Amos (John C. Reilly) reflects on his insignificance despite being married to a murderess who is on the front page of the newspapers. Throw in some dazzling choreography and you have the hallmarks of a great musical.<br /><br />Though Zellweger is undoubtedly the lead she is outshone by her co-stars. Though never on the A-list John C. Reilly seldom disappoints in a film and he is once again on fine form here. However, the biggest surprise for me was the performance of Catherine Zeta-ones as Velma Kelly. In both acting and dancing she stands out against the rest of the cast and that Oscar nod she was given doesn't quite seem as outrageous as I had previously thought.<br /><br />One of my big concerns with Chicago was the character of Roxie Hart. Though she is a wronged woman I didn't find her sympathetic particularly in the harsh treatment of her husband. Her self-absorption at the height of her fame with the media did slightly annoy and even when Billy Flynn does take on her case I found myself unconcerned whether she would escape the death penalty or not. The other characters in the film deserved more focus but in their supporting roles they each sustain Chicago and ensure it remains enjoyable throughout.<br /><br />Though not my favourite musical Chicago left my initial reservations completely unjustified. Its portrayal of the glamour of 1920s showbiz and the still unforgiving nature of the media were well conveyed. With some memorable music and performances it's easy to see why this musical has endured as long as it has.</p></body></html>

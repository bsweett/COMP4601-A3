<meta name="summary" content="sweet, smallish like the first one....really finishes up the franchise on top!"></head><body><p>I just came from the opening showing of the film and a suprisingly packed house for a noon viewing!  I really enjoyed the film and the story...as well as Stallone's brilliant dialog.  This was the Rocky character we all fell in love with 30 years ago....and I really appreciated all the references to the history of the character and particularly the first installment. A very good bookend to the first ROCKY...I don't want to spoil it for others by discussing plotlines...just encourage fans of the first,  in particular, to get off their butts and to the theatre....it would be good for this to succeed and shut up all the big mouths and naysayers who want this character to go away.</p></body></html>

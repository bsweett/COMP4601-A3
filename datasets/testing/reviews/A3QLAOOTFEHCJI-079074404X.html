<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Blu ray transfer for this sci-fi classic"></head><body><p>While somewhat primitive based on what we see today, the special effects and sets created for this sci-fi classic raised the bar for the genre.  For a more accurate comparison, look at some of the other films of the day.  Before Leslie Nielsen became the go-to guy for comedic parodies, he was a serious actor and yes, this is a serious film. Ann Francis plays his romantic interest and wears short "futuristic" outfits that, as Steven Spielberg says, "makes you wish she were your babysitter" when watching this movie as a kid. Both Nielsen and Francis died recently.  The story involves a team of space travelers from Earth in the 23rd century who is on a mission to find a research party that has not been heard from.  Upon arrival at the planet Altair-4, they are met by the lone survivors, Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon adding credibility to the role) and his winsome daughter, Alta (Francis).  The rest of the party has been killed by an alien creature decades earlier.  Morbius has discovered a new race that ruled for thousands of centuries only to disappear overnight.  The seemingly undefeatable creature comes back again, and the Shakespearian plot thickens.  Sure, the film has its share of cheese but it is easily offset by a more serious look at our inner selves.  Perhaps more important is that "Forbidden Planet" took a serious look at science fiction in film and set the stage for Star Trek, Star Wars and others to follow.  As an aside, the Blu ray package includes a terrific TCM documentary "Watch the Skies!" about sci-fi films of the 50's featuring interviews with the aforementioned Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron and Ridley Scott.  These guys know their film history and really get excited about these science fiction classics.</p></body></html>

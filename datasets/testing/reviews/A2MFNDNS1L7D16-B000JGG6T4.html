<meta name="summary" content="Typical Denzel  Washington fare, which is to say,"></head><body><p>excellent. He shows whole lot of acting talent as he goes from a depressed, disgraced alcoholic to a brave & tender protector of a little girl & back to the stone-cold agent he once was. He is the bodyguard of a wise beyond her years Dakota Fanning, isolated with her family in Mexico City, where kidnapping is a real fact of life. They bond as he coaches her in sports at school, raisng her confidence & becoming the person she can depend on, her parents being rather occupied with their own lives. She gives him the respect & affection he hasn't had from the outside world in a long time. Washington shows a wide range in this movie & it can be enjoyed by both men & women.</p></body></html>

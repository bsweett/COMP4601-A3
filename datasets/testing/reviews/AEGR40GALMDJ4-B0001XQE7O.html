Take all his previous films (Batman, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands) and turn them all upside down.  This film had almost no dark scary places, and hardly no dark colors.  This Tim Burton film was like a burst of all the colors of the rainbow.  The effects, the acting, the score, and the cinematography were all superb.  Alongside Ewan McGreggor, Jessica Lange, Albert Finney, and Billy Crudup, stand an awesome supporting cast including:  Allison Lohman, Steve Bushemi, Helena Bonham Carter, and the always awesome Danny Devito.  This film is for everyone to see.  Go be taken away by Big Fish.</p></body></html>

Its characters taste wine, drink it, talk about it, travel in the Wine Country, California and learn about the birth, growing and maturing of this almost living thing. Most inspirational and moving monologues are dedicated to the ancient but forever young child of Sun, Air, Earth and Grape; to its liquid fire that soothes and warms the soul and mind and keeps many secrets in its velvety depth. To create the fine wine would take time, right components in the right proportions, and love. This film feels like a fine wine. Everything is perfect - the actors' choice, the acting, directing , and the pace. It is a long film but it never rushes and it is never slow. The perfect combination of hilarity and bitter-sweetness, humor and drama, depressing realizations about life and hope make "Sideways' one of the best films of that year for me. It is the best of three Alexander Payne's films I've seen. This film like a fine wine would not get old or outdated. It would get better with each viewing; it would reveal more of its layers and its secrets, it would make you feel its taste and its unique aura long after you finish watching it.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great bizarre movie... definitely original."></head><body><p>Words cannot begin to describe how this film left me. I had to watch it twice to be sure, but I have to say it is exhilirating.<br />This has to be the most bizarre movie I have ever seen. The only one that even comes a bit close is any version of 'Sweeny Todd', simply because of the story line.<br />The plot has been gone over, so I won't do that again. I will say that everything about the movie was in prime shape. Actors, sets, costumes,story line, music.... it all came together into an amazing, repulsing masterpiece of a wondrous story! This could almost be fitting to be called a modern, adult fairy tale, with how violent the Grimm Brothers stories were.It does have a finishing moral to boot!<br />I highly recommend this film. This is one that could certainly be up for discussion in classrooms.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Halloween" is great!"></head><body><p>"Halloween" is great! The directing by Rob Zombie (who also directed "House Of 1000 Corpses" (2003) & "The Devil's Rejects" (2005) is great. Most of the cast and crew that Zombie has worked with is working with him, again. The cast led by Malcolm McDowell (as Dr. Samuel Loomis) & Sheryl Moon Zombie (as Deborah Myers) (who also is Zombie's wife and has starred in Zombie's "House Of 1000 Corpses" & "The Devil's Rejects"), is great. The screenplay by Zombie (based on John Carpenter's and Debra Hill's screenplay) (who also wrote the screenplay to "House Of 1000 Corpses" & "The Devil's Rejects") is great. The music by Tyler Bates (who also did the music to "300" (2007), "Slither" (2006), "The Devil's Rejects", & "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004) is excellent. The cinematography by Phil Parmet (who also did the cinematography to "The Devil's Rejects") is great. The film editing by Glenn Garland (who also did the film editing to "The Devil's Rejects") is great. The casting by Monika Mikkelsen (who also did the casting to "The Devil's Rejects") is great. The production design by Anthony Tremblay (who also did the production design to "The Devil's Rejects") is great. The art direction by T.K. Kirkpatrick (who also did the art direction to "The Devil's Rejects") is great. The set decoration by Lori Mazuer & Stephanie Ziemer is great. The costume design by Mary McLeod is great. This is a great remake that is faithful to the original and a little bit more inventive.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="T3 Rise of the Machines - Better than I expected!"></head><body><p>Given that James Cameron wasn't involved in the making of this film and that "The Terminator" is his baby, his creation, one would've expected his involvement.  Take that and the fact that "T2 Judgment Day" seemed to put an end to Skynet and the horrible future created for this outstanding series and one might've expected the plot to be thin but that simply isn't the case.  This film does an outstanding job of extending the "Terminator" mythos and series as a whole!<p>The premise:<p>As we all learned in "T2 Judgment Day," seemingly all possibilities for Skynet to come into existence and launch its war against humanity are supposedly eliminated by that films Terminator, and Sarah and John Connor.  That isn't the case though as it seems that Skynet is an inescapable factor, leading to its taking control of every computer on the planet and waging its war against humanity.  Hence, we have the "purpose" for this film and the purpose for the Terminatrix to be sent back in order to once again chase down John Connor who is now in his early twenties.  Now we also have the purpose for Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator to make his trip through time to protect John Connor and others...  What follows is a well done film that is extreme in the action sequences and a fairly well laid out plot.  The Terminatrix is definitely a thrilling villain against Arnold's Terminator.<p>I'd say that my first impression of the film after this first viewing is that yes, it's a good film to go to the theater to watch and yes, even though one might think they couldn't extend the story after T2, it does.  In the final analysis though, when one compares the depth of the stories told in the first two films, one can definitely see that the series creator, James Cameron, either wasn't involved at all or at the least he wasn't involved much!  Which is pretty much why I can only give this film four stars!<p>Would I recommend that you go see this film, yes it is worth it!  Would I buy the DVD when it's released, yes!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>Hey kido's this is a theatrical release, the only special features that you get to enjoy on this film at this point is the kid fidgeting and yammering away in the seat next to you, the infant wailing away several seats down from but so loud they seem to be right next to you and oh yeah, the couple three seats down from you that seem to think that the cell phone their yakking on is more important than the movie they paid to see.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

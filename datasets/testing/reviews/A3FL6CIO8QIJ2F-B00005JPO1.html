<meta name="summary" content=""Despite What Fans Say This Is A Great Film""></head><body><p>The second highest grossing film of 2008, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" took 19 years to make. Critics loved the movie, but ardent fans of the franchise were dissapointed in the script and the finalized film. However, being one of Indiana Jones' biggest fans I loved the movie. Action-packed with a great script, I enjoyed the movie the four times I saw it in theatres and I was extremely satisfied by what I saw. In this version Indiana is teamed up with his first love Marion from the original movie, played by Karen Allen. They also have a son who teams up with them in their battle against a beautiful evil agent, played by Kate Blanchett, who wants the rare crystal skull. The movie would ultimately gross nearly $800,000,000 at the boxoffice becoming the second most popular Indiana Jones movie of all-time. The DVD contains am informative featurette entitled "The Return of the Legend".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Region 4 "Definitive Edition" dont bother if you have the Special Edition"></head><body><p>This version of Robocop on DVD for region 4 (Australia) is titled Robocop: Definitive Edition. So, if you do not have this version, there is not much point to reading this review.<br /><br />I wont review the movie, I have already done that for another DVD release version.<br /><br />What I do wan't to point out is that if you do have the previous Special Edition (region 4 release) then don't bother with this release of Robocop, as it only has about 3 or 4 things on it in the bonus features that where not included in the original release here.<br /><br />This edition is great for those in region 1 (USA/Canada) because the bonus features where not included in the original Robocop DVD release, where as here in Australia we had the special edition that was filled with extras and the directors cut on the SAME SINGLE DISC!!!!<br /><br />This version they have sliced the DVD in half and put it onto 2 discs, with one disc having the original theatrical movie, and the second showing the extended cut. So, if you have the original special edition that had both versions of the movie on the one disc, and are not obsessed enough with the film to want 5 minutes of bonus features you might not have seen before, then don't think you are missing out on anything, the special edition is the better of the two.<br /><br />It is cheaper for MGM to make two discs then use a slightly more expensive disc and pack it all onto the one disc. So don't think a two disc edition sounds better and has more features, cause it does not have very much else on it at all. They are just a few interviews with the actors who played villains in the film and they talk about a few things that might interest you if you really want to know... other wise, like i said, keep the Special Edition.</p></body></html>

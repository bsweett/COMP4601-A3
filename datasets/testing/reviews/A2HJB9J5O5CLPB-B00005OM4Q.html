Did you do acid and meet mommy in a sleeping bag?  Sure kids, another time, another place, and don't do drugs.<br /><br />Rock died in the mid 70's, came back in Seattle in early 90's, and died again. Roaming the world in bus and jet like gypsies, that's really cool for a little while. Only groupies and drugs make it bearable for the long haul.<br /><br />Cameron Crowe had his experience back in 73 and Almost Famous is his belated version.  The actors are okay, the sets look rock-like, but something is not documentary true about those days. I was there and this fake sex and drugs was not fake in 73. In film, the era is sanitized for paying customers, my teens and the nostalgic baby boomers.  Penny Lane is sure nice for a really bad girl.  Read the screenplay and it's as good as the movie.  Hats off to Camereon.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The 50th Walt Disney Animated Classic"></head><body><p>Background:<br /><br />Tangled has its origins from the German fairy tale Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm.<br />It was first published in 1812 as part of a collection of children's tales. It is believed that this story was an adaptation from a fairy tale called Persinette by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force which was originally published in 1698. It is a story that has been beaten to a pulp, and is best know for the line: "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair".<br /><br />Even further back, this story may seem to be a modified feminized version of the Biblical story of Samson as related to in the book of Judges chapter 13. Here because Samson was a Nazarite a razor was never allowed to touch his hair.<br /><br />Marketing and Sales:<br /><br />This film was originally titled and marketed as Rapunzel, however, at the last minute the name was changed to Tangled. It is the second most expensive film ever made and most expensive animated film ever made with a budget of $260 million. Tangled is also notable for being the third-highest grossing animated film in the Disney animated canon (unadjusted for inflation), behind The Lion King ($783,841,776) and Aladdin ($504,050,219).<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) is just about to turn 18 years old. She wants a special gift, to go outside of the tower that she has been in for her entire life. Her mother, Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) buntly refuses. As an alternative, she asks for more paint (she paints as one of her many past times in the tower). Mother Gothel agrees to go for it, but it's a 3-days journey away.<br /><br />While she is away, Rapunzel manages to strike up a bargain with Flynn Rider, a thief on the run (voiced by Zachery Levi). At this point her voyage to the outside world begins.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />It is quite surprising that this 100 minute animated feature has been given a rating of PG instead of G. In my opinion this may be due to the emotional and psychological content that Mother Gothel generates by her deceptive and manipulative relationship with Rapunzel. (since there is no nudity or offensive language in this film)<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />Gothel observes a single drop of pure sunlight hit the ground, creating a magical flower with the ability to heal the sick and injured, as well as keep someone young by singing to it. Centuries past as she maintains her youth. Until the pregnant queen of a nearby kingdom gets sick. Her guards manage to retrieve the flower and make a broth out of it. The queen is healed, however, as a side-effect, her daugther is born with hair with the same magical properties.<br /><br />Gothel realises this and kidnaps the child and raises her as her own. But, every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom sends thousands of floating lanterns into the sky longing for their lost princess to return. Rapunzel desires to find the source of these lights a theit true purpose.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This is an excellent family film, with lots of musical content as well as humor. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

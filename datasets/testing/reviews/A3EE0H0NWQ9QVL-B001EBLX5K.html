Although we've seen hints of the clueless alien before ('Moscow on the Hudson,' 'Crocodile Dundee,' and, even to a lesser extent Jeff Bridges in 'Starman,') 'Borat' takes us through America with an alien-like never before. Using the male custom of greeting one another for a kiss, having different toiletry folkways, and regarding Jews with an ignorant fear, Borat and his producer sidekick, Azamat (Ken Davidian), set out for America in search of the best in us to take back to his country. His learning curve is necessary lesser than most visitors and immigrants, but it provides some very funny moments. One is found where he and Azamat wrestle naked in their hotel room (a match which goes into the hallways, the elevator and a hotel convention) after Borat catches him having a crude fascination with Pamela Anderson. (His infatuation with her is enough allure to take his trek from New York to California--not as originally planned.) (The Middle East has known to import 'Baywatch' like no other American product, regardless of their regard--or lack thereof--of women.) This enables our clueless Kazakhstanis a full view of America, and they meet all kinds, including a rodeo crowd, where are hero innocently provides a poor rendering of the National Anthem. They also meet gays, feminists, frat boys, an etiquette society, a Confederate antique store owner, etc. While much of the movie is crude, it is intensely funny. It has the power to offend some of the people some of the time, but it also has the power to make us all laugh most of the time. Even if the jokes are mostly on us.</p></body></html>

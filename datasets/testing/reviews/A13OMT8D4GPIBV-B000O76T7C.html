It's the perfect mix of horror and sci-fi.  From the openinh to the final moments, you're in for one of the best films of the last thirty years.<br /><br />A masterpiece.  This collection has not only the original 1979 masterpiece but the 2002 "director's cut".  This movie not only has good acting, but beautiful cinematography and scenery, and a hint of the unknown.  All in all, a very good watch.<br /><br />The DVD features commentary on both editions of the film, deleted scenes (included and non included in the "director's cut") and a number of making of featurettes for your viewing pleasure.<br /><br />Must Have.</p></body></html>

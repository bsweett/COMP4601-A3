<meta name="summary" content="I'd find the extra's to be the best part of the DVD"></head><body><p>When I saw the movie I just couldn't get too excited over it. I didn't mind the plotline of 12 yr. old Matt Murdock being blinded by a splash of Industrial waste and soon after developing sonic vision, I just couldn't get into the story.<br />Ben Affleck was all right as adult Matt but I think I liked the young actor who did Matt Murdock at 12 better. Jennifer Garner was good as Elektra but you can see her doing much the same every week on TV in Alias,for what she probably cost they should've given her more screen time. Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin was pretty good although I think he gave up too easily in the climactic battle with Daredevil.<br />The best fight scene in the movie, if you could call it that, was when Elektra and Matt Murdock had a sparring match on some teeter-totters in a playground.<br />The extra's are what I'd most likely buy this one for.</p></body></html>

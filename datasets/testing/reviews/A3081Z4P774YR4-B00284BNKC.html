<meta name="summary" content="A Truly Powerful Film"></head><body><p>One of the things I can't seem to let go of after seeing &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; is how people can let themselves become victims of their own personal vices.  As terrifying it is to see one character try to escape reality by shooting drugs into an infected and rotting vein, I can't help but feel sympathy for those who seem to be unaware of how their addiction has imprisoned them.  The character of Sara (played memorably by Ellen Burstyn) is among the greatest example.  To watch a character like that change from a complacent, yet likeable human to what we see at the end of this film is nothing less than tragic.  What is surprising is how this movie doesn't turn into a celebration of drugs, but rather a stark and horrifying reminder of how habits (of any kind) can destroy the soul long before it destroys the body.  This is truly one of the best films this decade has produced.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The 3rd James Bond Film"></head><body><p>Governments are not the only targets that interest SPECTRE.<br /><br />Auric Goldfinger (Bert Frobe) sets-up the national crime syndicate for a con, inviting them to participate in the unbelievable bank robbery of Fort Knox; a bank that is guarded by 40,000 soldiers and contains the entire gold reserve of the United States.<br /><br />After Goldfinger has collected one million dollars from each syndicate boss for the right to hear the plan, the bosses believe the robbery idea to be stupid and want the money returned. Goldfinger destroys them all, one in a particularly colorful way.<br /><br />Meanwhile in England, MI6 has been watching Goldfinger, believing that he is responsible for smuggling an unprecedented amount of gold out of country. James Bond is assigned to the task and watches from a distance, until the sister of a lady Goldfinger is responsible for killing tries to even the score. As she begins to get herself into serious trouble, James Bond intervenes but is captured by Goldfinger.<br /><br />Only then, does 007 learn that Goldfinger's plan is to detonate a nuclear devise in Fort Know. This will effectively take the Fort Knox gold off the market; crippling western economies, and make Goldfinger wealthy by increasing the overall market price ten fold.<br /><br />This is by far the best James Bond movie. After "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love", the James Bond character has been honed to the expectations of a growing audiences. Budgeting looks bigger, everything is broader, more elaborate. Best of all is that the James Bond character remains a very realistic portrayal of a secret service agent.<br /><br />A great movie and good entertainment for the whole family.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent But Not Great -- and No James Cameron"></head><body><p>"Not bad, but inferior to the previuos ones."  That's what I thought after watching "T3: Rise of the Machines."  Jonathan Mostow did a very good job, but not as good as James Cameron.  Many people say many things about Cameron, but one thing is clear; he insists on his own vision.<p>That is sadly missing in this so-so sequel.  The story is basically the same as "T2": another super-robot is sent from the future to kill John Conner, who is supposed to be the savior of the world after the coming war between machines and humans, and another robot in the shape of Arnold Schwarznegger is also sent to protect him.  This time, however, things are a bit different, the film wants to say.<p>You can find no Cameron's signature -- no Linda Hamilton (that's a big minus); no unique idea like liquid-type super-killer of Robert Patrick, or no Edward Furlong.  Think about this, you know, these people all get famous after appearing in this series, and that's the proof that Cameron, who might be a director demanding too much, is good at inducing the actors to give 100% potentials.  And of course, Arnie, who became an instant star with "I"ll be back."<p>But Jonathan Mostow fails on this score; compared to Hamilton and Furlong, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are playing unimpressive characters, not credible as the hero and the heroine we can relate to.  Maybe I am too harsh, considering the fact that they replaced other players on short notice.  Anyway, all people should agree that they should not meet each otehr THAT way (no future hero should be kept up in that place like a dog.)  And about the new-comer Ms Loken as the new-type terminator, I thought she (it) doesn't look strong at all, giving too many gimmicks.  The filmmakers should have known that only one kind of weapon will do for truely strong heroes and villains (see the previous Terminators and all the characters in "X-Men").  <p>The actions themselvs are exciting, I can tell you, but you have to wait for it to hit the screen.  The film constantly shows something engaging, and the director, he says in an interview, intentionally keeps the running time within 2 hours.  Surely the film is action-packed.<p>This is a kind of a film producer Mario Kassar did in the 90s -- like "Universal Soldiers" -- no logics, good actions, and plenty of humor thrown in the plot.  The only difference is, I again say, no James Cameron.  If you still wondering whether you should watch it or not, think about this point first.</p></body></html>

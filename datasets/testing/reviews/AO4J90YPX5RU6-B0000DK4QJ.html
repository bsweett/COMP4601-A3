THAT'S HARD TO SAY WITH "E.T." AND "SCHINDLER'S LIST". BUT A REMARKABLE PIECE OF WORK NO LESS. EVERY MOMENT WAS EXCITING, THE EFFECTS WERE STATE OF THE ART. THIS IS WHAT YOU COME TO EXPECT FROM SPIELBERG. I'LL BE ADDING THIS TO MY DVD COLLECTION. THAT'S FOR SURE. TOM CRUISE AND THE CAST ARE BRILIANT! I MUST MENTION LOIS SMITH (OLD LADY WITH ALL THE PLANTS) WHO WAS SUPERB. SEE IT!</p></body></html>

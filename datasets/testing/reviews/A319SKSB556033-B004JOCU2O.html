But the incompetence of a fat yard worker allows a half-mile long freight loaded with hazardous chemicals to get loose and tear through the countryside. Our heroes then put aside their usual chores to catch up with the loco and hit the brakes all while head office and the media watch and wait.<br /><br />Sound exciting. It's not. There's no real sense of speed. Tony Scott tries to make the audience believe that the train is going really fast with lots of quick, shaky camera pans and some annoying stutter cuts (when will THIS dumb trend come to an end?). It hits a few bumps and scratches a few cars, but no significant damage is done and no breathtaking destruction fills the screen with eye candy.<br /><br />I really have to wonder where the appeal was in the script. There's really nothing worth mentioning between the moment the trains starts and stops (yes, it does indeed stop). If this were a 70s disaster epic it would be 140 minutes long (as opposed to 98), would feature many, many deaths, even more obstacles, and would end with the train blowing up...and all with a PG-rating. In 2010 an easy ride with a couple of flash pans is apparently the best that they can do.<br /><br />Not a keeper.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds great in 2.40:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA 5.1 and plenty of features.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="As Good As Brando Gets"></head><body><p>This movie has everything going for it and gets better with each viewing. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it is on many people's list as one of the best American films ever made. Marlon Brando gives as good a performance as he ever gave. I'm not sure you would know he was Brando if you hadn't read the credits already. There are great performances by the supporting actors as well: Dianne Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino in particular who does a marvellous job of growing into the leader of the Corleone family after the death of Brando.<br /><br /> Mario Puzo, the author of the novel from which the movie was based, said that he was writing about family. That may be true, but we are dealing here with the family involved in the family business. Two of the most exciting and extended scenes have to do with the most important of family events, a wedding and a christening. Family values? The christening scene in particular is as chilling and effective as anything you'll see in a movie. And I still gasp everything I see the scene with the horse.<br /><br /> Surely the highly successful &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, as well as other movies on the subject of Sicilian families, owes much to &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Beautifully filmed, masterfully directed and acted, this is a film for all seasons.</p></body></html>

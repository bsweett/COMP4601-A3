<meta name="summary" content="A flawed yet excellent movie"></head><body><p>I really ejoyed this movie yet it has it's problems.<br /><br />The problems emenate from two things;<br /><br />1) The characters are emotionless and practically cardboard and<br /><br />2) many apsects of this seem very implausible.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is not supposed to be based on reality, it's just a movie and it does entertain brilliantly.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is Mike Sullivan, a sort of honorable hitman working for his adoptive father and crime boss Mr. Rooney, played by Paul Newman. Rooney has a biological son, played by Daniel Craig, who is a complete failure. In a [presumed] bit of jealousy (the movie never really explains this) Craig goes to wipe out Hank's wife and child not knowing that Hanks and his other son got away. In response to this, Hanks, along with his surviving son, goes on a revenge rampage against the whole gang. This is all set in early 1930's depression America.<br /><br />There are problems with some narrative, Craig's actions are not adequately explained, Hanks really does not bereave when he loses his family and people find each other, in a vast 1930's U.S.A., way too easily.<br /><br />I give an easy pass to the aforementioned flaws since this movie is based upon a graphic novel so, obviously, the visual takes presedence over other aspects and the visual is quite impressive.<br /><br />Hanks, believe it or not, is a credible hitman and is often filmed as a shawdowy figure in a trenchcoat and face hiding fedora. As in any comic book, he has few things to say. It is imputed through the film that he is a widely regarded and feared hitman. Paul Newman is portrayed as a physically frail yet mentally strong mob boss. Consistent with comic book monologues, his lines are prophetic. In fact, everybody as brief lines consistent with a graphic novel. Teh dialgoue is just enough to carry the plot.<br /><br />The scenes of old cars careening through country roads or Chicago streets are highly artistic. Likewise, many of the city scenes are done in a art deco manner and are very cinematic.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is it's visuals. Every scene is meaningful, every shadow has it's purpose, every sound advances the plot. There's not a wasted scene. Just like a comic book, every scene is punctuated and that is what makes this movie so great.<br /><br />The tone of the movie, the visuals, the characters are all over-the-top stylish and that is why I find this movie to be such an entertaining piece of art.<br /><br />When you realize the movie is based upon a graphic novel then you should give a free pass to the noticeable flaws.</p></body></html>

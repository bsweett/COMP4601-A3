<meta name="summary" content="If you can avoid thinking about it, a pretty enjoyable heist film"></head><body><p>I have said it before, and it remains true: I enjoy every second when I see Denzel Washington on the screen.  He is about as engaging an actor as there is.  Yet he keeps each character fresh and different.  True, I enjoy some performances more than others and some of the films he is in I can't even work myself up to seeing.  But when I do, he is always most engaging.  This is a movie I would not have watched except that he is in it.  I had heard less than enthusiastic things about it, but decided to give it a try.  After all, if Denzel is in it, well, it has to have some redeeming qualities.<br /><br />So, how was it?  Well, while I was watching it I was quite engaged.  The actors are all very good and give more than fine performances.  And I think Spike Lee has done a terrific job in putting this film together.  After it is over, and you think back on aspects of the plot, which I will not go into here, because you shouldn't know any more going in than it is a bank robbery, you will realize that Lee has pulled a big rabbit out of a very small hat.<br /><br />I have already said that Denzel's performance as Det. Keith Frazier is terrific.  His partner, Det. Bill Mitchell is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, whom I first noticed as "The Operative" in "Serenity".  He is just as engaging here in a vastly different role.  Jodie Foster is another of my favorites, and she does very well with what she is given here.  But here role here is more like the function of a magician's assistant than a protagonist.  Her character, Madeline White, allows the paranoids in the audience to believe this is how the broader culture actually works and White allows certain points of exposition to happen rather than having any real payoff.  I am saying that I still love Jodie Foster, but this role was a dud DESPITE her fine acting.<br /><br />Arthur Case, played by the great Christopher Plummer, is not quite believable because he would have to be about twenty years older than Plummer is and would have to have made some decades long very stupid choices for no explicable reasons in order for this plot to work.  Clive Owen is the other main character, Dalton Russell.  He has a hard job because in most of the movie his face and body are mostly covered.  I still don't know how Owen's character learned enough to target what he was after in this movie.  If he had discovered the materials and objects by accident, that would have been different.  But the plot has him going only after these items.  We can project motives on him afterwards, but I don't recall the movie making clear how he gained the intelligence and what his motivation actually was for such a difficult and risky crime.<br /><br />Anyway, a decent heist film while you watch it.  I just don't recommend thinking about it too much along the way or afterwards.</p></body></html>

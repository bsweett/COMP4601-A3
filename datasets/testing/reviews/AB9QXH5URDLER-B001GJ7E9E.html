<meta name="summary" content="Fun, Light-Hearted Action Flick"></head><body><p>What a great premise as a backdrop to this little adventure flick!  The film in no place takes itself seriously, yet it does engage you and keep your attention.  There is enough tongue-in-cheek humor spread through the comic-book style action to keep most people entertained.  If you want a little "Jackie Chan marries James Bond" type of action, this is the film for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DREN WAS EXCELLENT"></head><body><p>SPLICE<br /><br />I have to say that when this film first came out other than the crazy looking female in it I wasn't to into it. But of course tha changed when I actually got the chance to see it and my opinion turned around. Don't get me wrong I always wanted to see it but it was not a priority. This film actually turned out to be much better than I thought it would be, in fact I thought it would be just average. I was pleasantly surprise as I thought it was a great flick. Add in that Guillermo Del Toro had a hand in this and you have the potential for a great movie.<br /><br />Two scientists who are also together work at a company pushing the limits of DNA research; in fact they have created a new species by splicing animal genes together. When they put the new animals together [one male and one female] things go pretty good. But they want to take it a bit farther and add in human DNA to their next project. That of course gives birth to a humanoid like creature they name Dren, which of course is nerd backwards. Clive and Elsa {Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley} have different points of view on this new life form. Elsa views Dren as a daughter and wants to care for her while Clive wants the subject gone, but the views they each have change hands as Dren gets older.<br /><br />I thought this was absolutely a brilliant film especially the first ?'s of the film, the ending kinda went down a bit but it was still good. But everything before that was brilliant because Dren really did come off as a human female child. Going threw all the emotions and changes a girl would in real life. It is in this that the relationship between the three elevates this movie in my eyes. Things do get a little crazy here but I was kinda into it mainly because it felt real to me, I thought it moved along pretty good.<br /><br />Of course the ending of the film while good could have been better in my opinion and some scenes needed a boast. But I did like the performances here from our lead cast, now they did much better in the relationship scenes more so than the scientist scenes but oh well. Adrien Brody did a great job here as did Sarah Polley especially in anything that involved Dren. Of course it was great seeing my boy David Hewlett here even if he wasn't the star, Simona Maicanescu, and Brandon McGibbon were also good here. But it was Abigail Chu as child Dren and Delphine Chaneac as adult Dren that stole the show; they both did a great job.<br /><br />Director Vincenzo Natali along with fellow writers Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor did a great job here for the most part. The story is straight forward and not hard to follow at all but it is still compelling. Now to be honest it is Dren and the performances of the two that played her that really carried this film but all did a great job. There are flaws like with all things but I really liked this one for some reason. I think it is because I waited for the DVD release and had time to let hype die down. So I went into this with out any high expectations and I came out liking it.<br /><br />I do recommend this film but hit up a rental first because some people will most likely not like this. In fact some people may hate some of the things that happen in this flick, I loved it. When you watch you will know what parts I am talking about, I am sure some already do know. Over all this was much better than I thought it would be.</p></body></html>

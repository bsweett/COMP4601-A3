Penn is a lion of an actor, but the tenderness he radiates here is revelatory.  His physical transformation is nothing compared to the way Penn gets at the core of the man, finding the source of his joy and pain. He disappears into Harvey with the artistry of an acting virtuoso. There's one word for Penn's performance: phenomenal." Peter Travers<br /><br />I remember hearing about the death of Harvery Milk and the Mayor of San Francisco-and I watched television with all of the Gay marches. But, somehow, I missed much of the Gay movement. I support Gays and their rights. I was married and stating to have children and it passed me by.  Sean Penn as Harvey Milk brought it home, up close and personal. I cannot say enough about Penn's extraordinary performance. He truly deserved the Oscar for best male performance. This film should be seen by every adult in America for a full understanding of the life and times of our Gay brothers and sisters. I cannot forget the film, it resonates within me.<br /><br />Sean Penn became Harvey Milk. His every movement, fleck of his hair or tug of his smile. James Franco as Scott, Harvey' lover is superb. Emile Hirsch, who played the lead role in Sean Penn's directing debut 'Into The Wild' plays Clem Jones, anactivist in the making. Alison Pill is the Lesbian campaign manager, and she is perfect in this role. Josh Brolin plays Supervisor White, and not for one minute would I have guessed who he was, if I had not seen the credits. Josh Brolin is an actor destined for big roles.  Gus Van Sant directs this phenomenon, he interjects footage from the real times in 1978 with present day filming of Harvey Milk in San Franscisco. And Anita Bryant- I was waiting for the pie in the face. She so perfectly personifies the sueprcilious and pompousness of the extreme right and their hatred and misunderstanding of homosexuals.<br /><br />'Milk' is a fitting Memorial for Harvey Milk. For all the generations who have walked the walk and fought the good fight, kudos to you. For those of you who missed the Gay Rights, start here and get in line. This is a film not to be missed.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended.  prisrob 03-10-09<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K0DQ">Dead Man Walking</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JMTI">The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MVWFAO">W.

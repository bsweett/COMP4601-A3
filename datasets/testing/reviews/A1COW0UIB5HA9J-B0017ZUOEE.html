<meta name="summary" content="A new supernatural classic!"></head><body><p>A woman named Laura was a former orphan who lived in a nice orphanage that had a bad past raises an adopted son named Simon with HIV and a husband named Carlos as they were a happy family. Until one day, Simon discovers that he has invisible friends that he plays with and terrible memories from Laura's past have literally come back to haunt her as the spirits take away her son. Desperate to find her son, she feels an unworldy prescence in her house and calls on some local Paranormalists to help her, can she find out the mysterious secrets of the abandoned orphanage or will she loose her son?<br /><br />Smart, terrifying and starling supernatural Spainish/Mexican horror thriller import is one of the best horror thrillers in recent memory. Director J.A. Bayona and executive producer Guillermo Del Toro ("Pan's Labyrinth", "Hellboy 1 & 2", "Blade 2" and "Cronos") brings us a chilling tale about life and death in a positive and well done way. The performances are just terrific and the storyline is complicated but very good, i also like how they use old-school make up techniques instead of CGI at some parts and the ending is just amazing as it has to be seen to believe.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers an excellent high resolution quality in picture and sound as i believe this movie is better seen and heard on Blu-Ray. It's presented in Spanish with English Subtitles and has some good extras like three featurettes, still galleries, Teasers and Trailers, Poster explorations and rehearshal Studio featurette, i strongly recommend this great ghost story.<br /><br />Also recommended: "The Shining", "House (1986)", "Poltergeist", "Stir of Echoes", "Pan's Labyrinth", "The Others", "The Sixth Sense", "Final Destination Trilogy", "The Skeleton Key", "Stephen King's The Shining (1997)", "Making Contact (a.k.a.

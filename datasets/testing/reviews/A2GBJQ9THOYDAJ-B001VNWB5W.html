<meta name="summary" content="We can breathe again -- they didn't screw it up!"></head><body><p>This is one of those films that -- if you read and re-read the book as so many have -- you look forward to with both anticipation and a bit of dread. Because they could so easily have screwed this up. But I'm pleased, and a little surprised, to find that the film follows the book pretty closely -- in all the important ways. Because the book isn't really about superhero crimefighters. It's about people, both good and bad, and how they fit together. And the film pulls it off very well. The character of the uncompromisingly absolutist Rorschach, the most interesting character in both the book and the film, is very nicely rendered. Even Dr. Manhattan, the least "human" character, is portrayed in multiple dimensions. I think they made a good decision in not giving any of the roles to a headlining actor. No Nicholas Cage, no Gwyneth Paltrow to steal the scenes. You can pay attention to the roles the actors are playing, not the actors themselves. And, yeah, there's a lot of gore in this film, . . . but that's a human thing, too. Even the fight scenes are more explicit than you would expect (this is definitely not a kids' film), but that's to make a point. Because there's also a morality tale here about how things can so easily go wrong with society. The world is facing nuclear annihilation and it's largely because the forces of violently coercive conservatism are in control -- typified by the Comedian, who kills women and children without batting an eye, and by the fact that Richard Nixon is in his fifth term as president. Even Dan Dreibeg and Laurie Jupiter, the putative Good Guys, are out there on the right wing somewhere, trying to make the world their version of a "better place." This take on the 1980s is not the Good Old Days that might have been. And, of course, there's the overarching question: Is it right to do great evil in the successful pursuit of even greater good? The film actually seems much more explicit than the book about the "alternate universe" aspect of the story, right from the outset in the credits -- which do a very nice job of summarizing the back-story, incidentally. But let's face it, a lot of people went to see this flick for the special effects, and those are great -- and without getting in the way of the live action, which is quite an accomplishment. Especially everything surrounding Dr. Manhattan. There are lots of great quotable lines, most of them directly from the book. My favorite: "None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with me." The choice of `80s songs for the soundtrack also is very interesting; most of them fit the atmosphere of the story, even the actual plotline. (Except for "99 Luft Balloons": What in the world is that doing in there?) All in all, an excellent screen version of an excellent book. I expect to be revisiting both of them at regular intervals in the future. I do miss the giant alien squid, though.</p></body></html>

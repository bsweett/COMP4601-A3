<meta name="summary" content="Pangs of New York"></head><body><p>"Gangs of New York" is one of those periodic films that grabs a lot of Oscar nominations and comes away with no statuettes.  "Peyton Place" was the reigning champ in this dubious category but Scorcese's film gave them a run for the money.  After watching it the other night, I came to understand why this happened; The movie opens strong and closes nearly as strong while the interminable bulk of the movie meanders in a repetitious drone.  If Scorcese had a point, he should have made it.  I took time out for supper without a second thought.  Leftovers were better than what needn't have been served in the first place.<br /><br />When I say that the film opened strong I guess I'd better qualify my statement.  The build-up to a gang war with no quarter was a bit overdone but at least it gave the viewer a sense that this was going to be one of those action movies that can succeed without the extranvagance of a plot.  That's the problem; without the action we are left with a rather ridiculous cast of characters.  I understand that this is based on real Gotham history and I was focussed on the subtleties leading up the the New York Draft Riots.  However, that singularly important event was forced to play a duet with a lesser talent.  The resulting Armaggedon left me wondering if there was anything left in New York City that was worth salvaging.  I read complaints about the lack of a "Director's Cut" that would have added an hour or so to this lengthy Leviathan.  This was not a case of too much left out but, rather, too much shoved in.</p></body></html>

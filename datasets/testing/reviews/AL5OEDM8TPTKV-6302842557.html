<meta name="summary" content="The Extraordinary among the Mediocrity"></head><body><p>Certainly a fantasia on the life of one of the world's greatest composers, &quot;Amadeus&quot; is more much more than merely dreamed biography. It soars above the retelling of a wonderous life, presenting to us a mosiac of deep meaning, wonderful performances, sensational music, and one of the best movies ever made.<p>Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abrams take control of this movie the first time they appear in it, and refuse to let it go. Whereas the power in their lives rests in the monarchy, they are the true power of this film as they dance and weave around each other. Salieri, a now forgotten composer, apparently once revered in his time, secretly adores and publicly abhors Mozart, gifted prodigy.  By giving us some creative if not accurate context for Mozart's music, we see the true brilliance of his greatness, by comparing and listening to his music through Salieri's simple ears.  The finest moment of the film perhaps comes at the ending, with Salieri, an old and feeble man, realizing that his life has added up to nothing but mediocrity and meagerness. As he's wheeled through the halls of the sanitorium, he blesses the crazy and insane, reveling in the pain of the irony his life has become. Incredible.<p>As mentioned, Hulce and Abrams both soar in their roles; each embody the true spirits of their characters, there is not a moment's doubt or hesitation in their performances.  Their acting is so perfect, so refined, it is not acting, it is being. On the screen, the real Salieri and Mozart are before you. No finer gift can an actor give to his craft.<p>And no finer film can a group of professionals give the world. Amadeus is all about brilliance at the same time being all about mediocrity. This duality drives the tension and the drama, making the film so wonderfully complex and deep. I never tire of watching this, each time finding a new glimmer previously not realized. <p>It is well worth your time, if you have not yet done it, to settle down and allow &quot;Amadeus&quot; to soak over you, and prepare to marvel.</p></body></html>

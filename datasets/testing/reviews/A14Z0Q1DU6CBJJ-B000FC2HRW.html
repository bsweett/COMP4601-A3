Strangely enough, most trilogies of the horror genre lose their production value and strength of character. Yet, instantly I was struck by the quality of the production.<br /><br />Honestly, the FINAL DESTINATION movies are REALLY one dimensional. There's no Freddy, Jason or Michael. There's an invisible force. A myth of death. A myth of when it's your time, it's your time and death will get you one way or the other.<br /><br />So there's no funny Freddy lines or chases. No scary faces. There aren't even any scary moments. Just... death scenes. Sort of like watching a fictionalized FACES OF DEATH. Sorta morbid now that I think about it. Yet, the characters are engaging, especially the lead character Wendy, played by relative newbie Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Ring 2 & Sky High).<br /><br />The most noteable thing, as I've already mentioned, is the production value. The MONSTER ROLLERCOASTER scene is very cool. Never in my life has a movie rollercoaster scene gave me that artificial feeling in the gut like being on a real rollercoaster, but, although not a huge effect, I sort of felt it in this movie. They took a regular and small theme park rollercoaster and CG'd a MONSTER ROLLERCOASTER and it's very effective. It looked incredibly high.<br /><br />It doesn't stop there. Nearly all of the scenes in Final Destination 3 are well done and engaging. The weight machine, the drive thru, the tanning beds, the warehouse & the carnival.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie. I really did. Is it classic stuff? No. Does it have strong entertainment value? Sure does. I'll certainly buy this... just to ride the Monster Rollercoaster over and over.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding acting redeems hum drum serial killer movie"></head><body><p>I have had it up to here (pointing to my forehead) with violent movies about psychopaths. I was very hesitant to watch one more trip to the sociological garbage heap. The difference with this movie is that if you miss Theron's performance, you will have missed one of the greatest acting performances of the year. I admired the acting; I didn't care for the movie. Theron seems hypnotized into thinking that she is real life killer Aileen Wournos. Here is an actress who seems to channel the soul of the person she is playing. Excellent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kate Winslet and Jack Black rock"></head><body><p>Between the pairs Kate Winslet - Jack Black in L.A. and Cameron Diaz - Jude Law in U.K., I must say the L.A. pair was the more interesting to watch. Kate Winslet showed heart (kind to the elderly neighbour), taste  and intelligence with a longing for true love. Jack Black showed sense. And the big, spacious and ambient L.A. mansion surely helps a lot.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz - Jude Law 's storyline in Surrey, on the other hand, appears to be shallow and unconvincing. The chemistry between Cameron and Jude seem to be non-existing. When they first met in the Surrey cottage, the way they giggled, conversed and the things they said were teenage stuff and predictable. No way could this be an indispensable and successful Hollywood trailer maker with a sharp sense. However, there were shots of the picturesque Surrey cottage that were simply postcard perfect. The movie could do a lot better if the story in Surrey is given more substance and heart.</p></body></html>

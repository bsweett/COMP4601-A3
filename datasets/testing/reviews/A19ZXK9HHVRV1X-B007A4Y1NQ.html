Overflowing with imagination and creativity, it manages to breathe new life into that  trickiest of cinematic genres - the surrealist satire. Like all films that  dare to take risks, `Being John Malkovich' sometimes stumbles in the paths  it chooses to take, but at least its course is always an innovative and  fascinating one.<p>John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz, a soft-spoken  nebbish leading a life less of quiet desperation than of overwhelming  blandness. Unable to support himself as a puppeteer, he finally succumbs to  his wife's pressure to seek out a job, landing a position as file clerk in  a bizarre company located on the 7 ? th floor of a Manhattan office  building. One of the triumphs of the film is that it portrays the surreal  in such an understated and quiet way. This floor has ceilings so low that  the people who work on it must continually crouch as they move about their  business, yet they all accept that fact with an uncomplaining and  unquestioning good humor. Even when Schwartz discovers a strange portal  hidden behind some cabinets leading directly into John Malkovich's brain,  all those to whom Craig reveals his secret take very little convincing both  to believe him and to experiment with it themselves. Thus, by creating a  world that already appears slightly askew in its reality - Craig's wife, in  addition, runs a pet shop and therefore fills their house with a menagerie  of exotic animals -the film makes it possible for us to go along with the  characters' otherwise inexplicably blas&eacute; reactions.<p>Writer Charlie  Kaufman and director Spike Jonze hit upon a number of fascinating themes in  the course of their bizarre musings. Craig, for instance, learns that there  exists a certain safety in the tediousness of everyday life, for the moment  he allows the extraordinary to enter his ordered world he unleashes  passions - that have been long dormant both in himself and his wife - which  he finds himself unable to control. His wife, in particular, whom he has  mistakenly pigeonholed as a woman concerned only with the humdrum  domesticities associated with married life, provides him with a rude  awakening as she begins to surpass him in her burgeoning obsession with  experiencing the excitements of sexual liberation. Craig also discovers the  terrifying truth about himself, that, beneath the fa?ade of a meek,  mild-mannered artist there lurks the soul of a repressed despot, as he  comes more and more to relish the ability to move into Malkovich's mind and  control his thoughts and actions - much as with his beloved puppets, but  now on a much more grand, much more malevolent scale. The film generates  much of its comic tension through the complex sexual interplay that  develops among Craig, his wife, Lotte, and his alluring but enigmatic  co-worker, Maxine, in whom both husband and wife develop a more than  passing sexual interest. With tinges of `No Exit,' the three characters  find themselves caught in a frustrating world of overlapping and therefore  clashing sexual desires and passions.<p>The film demonstrates a real stroke  of genius in its casting. John Cusack, with his look of understated  bewilderment, perfectly conveys the soul of a man too long accustomed to  expecting little in the way of surprise out of life. Catherine Keener  brilliantly captures the detached cynicism and taunting coolness that makes  her such an enthralling sexual temptation to both Craig and Lotte. And  whose audacious decision was it to cast Cameron Diaz as the near-dowdy  second fiddle to Kenner, to make her the NON-sex object in the film? As for  Mr. Malkovich himself, he seems to be having the self-deprecating time of  his life as he allows himself and even his lack of general public name  recognition to become targets for gentle ribbing.<p>`Being John Malkovich'  is not a perfect movie. It occasionally sags in places and suffers from  some repetition and, like many utterly original and audacious works, it  sometimes alienates its audience through its quality of often-cold  calculation. At moments in which the iconoclasm seems to become an end in  itself, one may be tempted to see the film in emperor's-new-clothes terms,  wondering if what one is seeing is really as brilliant as it appears or  just an intellectual scam being played on a self-congratulatory elite  audience. For the most part, however, `Being John Malkovich' is fertile  enough in its invention and varied enough in its imaginativeness to rate as  a film well worth seeing and cherishing. There should definitely be more  like it!</p></body></html>

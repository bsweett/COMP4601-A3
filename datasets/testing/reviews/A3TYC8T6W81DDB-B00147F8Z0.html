<meta name="summary" content="Another Disappointing AVP Film"></head><body><p>*This does contain spoilers*<br /><br />Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem. I was crazy excited about seeing this. The trailer made the movie look amazing. It looked like somebody finally got it right. AVP was finally going to have a film in the versus franchise that lived up to the Alien and Predator films. So did it wind up being able to deliver? More importantly...was it better than the first(and might I add, awful) AVP film? The short answer...is not really.<br /><br />The film pretty much begins right where the original AVP left off with the alien bursting out of the chest of the main predator(you know, the one who teamed up...with a human) from the last film. That alien winds up being a crossbreed. A predalien(or alienator), if you will. This new breed of alien is let loose on this predator ship and winds up killing every predator on board. The ship winds up crashing on earth(somewhere in Colorado, if I remember right) thanks to all the mayhem. The facehuggers that the predators had been keeping on the ship(for research, I would assume) escape and well...do what they do best. The last surviving predator from the ship that crashed manages to send out a distress signal right before he's killed off. This signal gets sent to the predator homeworld where it manages to reach one of the most skilled and impressive predators ever. That predator winds up coming to earth to even the odds and teach those aliens a lesson. Since it takes place on earth, you know some humans are bound to get in the crossfire.<br /><br />So...where do I begin? I think one of the biggest drawbacks in this film is that it focuses way too much on the humans. I mean, does anybody really care about some teenager whose brother is an ex-con and is back in town while he works at a pizza place and has the hots for some girl? It's an ALIEN versus PREDATOR movie. Just show me them beating each other to a pulp and I'll be happy. You can dump the humans for all I care because if they're in the picture it looks like we have the option of them teaming up with the predator(s) or having to deal with some side story of teenagers swimming at the school pool. Psh. Lame. Somebody mentioned that AVP isn't going to be done right unless it all takes place in space and at this point, I tend to agree.<br /><br />The film was way too dark during the fight scenes. The random close-ups didn't really help either. Half the time, you didn't really know what was going on. Some of the CG scenes bugged me, too. It bugged me in Alien 3 and it bugs me now. I'm really picky with my CG effects though. I tend to like it to look as real as possible and when it's noticeably fake, it just seems cheesy to me. At least when they use animatronics or puppets, it looks a bit more realistic.<br /><br />The film left me with way too many questions. Too many to remember, actually. Here are a few: Why did the predator skin Ray and not use that blue goo on him to make him disintegrate? I was thinking he might have ran out...but then in the next scene, he used more of it. Was he just showing off his kill? Maybe he was making a statement?  Speaking of Ray, wasn't he skinned after the predator killed him? So that thing the sheriff said about Ray being, "skinned alive," was false then...<br /><br />Not only that, but some of the scenes seemed to be a blatant opening for the audience to make fun of them. Remember that scene where that pregnant woman was in the hospital? The dialogue went a little something like this:<br /><br />Pregnant woman: "Oh! I think my water just broke!"<br />Nurse: "Alright, I'll go and get you a doctor."<br /><br />Then the nurse walks out of the room...and gets killed by the predalien. Then you see the predalien walk up to the curtain and brush it aside. I just kept waiting for somebody to say, "The doctor will see you now," and the predalien saying something like, "What seems to be the problem?" Watch that scene again. You'll see what I'm talking about. Another one was at the end after the helicopter crash, when the little girl says to her mom, "Are the monsters gone, mommy?" And Kelly says, "They're all gone, baby," or something to that affect. I could just hear someone in a theater yelling, "Kind of like your dad! BURN!" And lastly...the "GET TO THE CHOPPER!" scene. Come on. Total throwback to Arnold yelling that in the original Predator. Wound up being more humorous than a homage to it though.<br /><br />My last gripe about the film are the noises the aliens and predator made. The predator howl/scream/yell/cry/whatever you want to call it sounded off. It sounded like a lion roar this time around. It sounded more raw, more...primal in the previous films. Continuity would be nice here, you know? The aliens sounded kinda weird, too. During the scene where they attack the national guard and they're screaming, their sound just sounded like an elephant only in a higher pitch. I didn't notice anything like that in the previous films. So that's saying something.<br /><br />Now with all the bad, there is a little bit of good in this film. The aliens and the predators have never looked so awesome. The costumes and make-up effects are pretty astounding. Also, what you can make out during the fight scenes is pretty sweet. That predator with the whip is quite impressive. That's really all I can say about him. The last forty five minutes or so of the film is where it finally picks up and is decent. If the rest of the film was like that, I would have been much more pleased.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, it was a disappointment overall. I had pretty high hopes though. I had told myself after the last AVP that I wouldn't get my hopes up again, but...I did. What can I say? I'm a sucker for this franchise. If it's any better than the original AVP, then it's only by a very small margin. It'd just be nice to see an AVP film that fans of the Alien and Predator films could be happy with and unfortunate that we can throw another crummy AVP movie to the pile.<br /><br />Rating: 5/10</p></body></html>

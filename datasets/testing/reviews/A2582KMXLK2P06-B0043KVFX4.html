<meta name="summary" content="lots of action with an easy to follow plot"></head><body><p>While I was hoping for a movie that resembled the mysterious and quiet atmosphere that was so popular in classic Resident Evil games such as RE2 and RE3 for the Playstation One console, I can understand taking the movies in a different direction (because let's be honest- when it concerns movies, the best idea is to take the series in an action-oriented direction because it's easier to keep people glued to their television sets when a film concentrates on lots of shooting, violence and action scenes).<br /><br />Anyway, as far as pure adrenaline-pumping action is concerned, Resident Evil- Extinction is pretty good. Lots of blood squirting from zombies heads going in all directions as they were viciously killed, a plot that's relatively easy to follow because if you've played the games you more or less know what to expect, and characters that were MUCH better than the poor acting skills that many reviews of this (and other) RE films led me to believe.  Everyone says the acting is bad in these RE movies, but I have to disagree.<br /><br />My favorite scene in the film involved lots and lots of infected crows! haha. That scene right there is really awesome. The segments that involved trying to find out how intelligent the zombies were was pretty good. Of course you already know what's going to happen when you try to tame an infected zombie as a way to find out how well they can communicate with normal people- death soon follows for the poor unfortunate people that happen to be near when the zombies suddenly flip out and lose control.<br /><br />One thing this movie didn't do that lots of OTHER zombies frequently do is this-<br /><br />When someone got bitten by a zombie, you know what happens- it's only a matter of time before they themselves turn into a zombie. Well that happens in this movie, but the other team members didn't seem concerned that one of their members just got bit by a zombie and acted like it wasn't a big deal.<br /><br />If I remember, in other zombie films, once a zombie is able to bite through the skin of a normal person, they WILL become infected, and that person has to be killed immediately. The people that got infected in this movie weren't killed immediately for whatever reason. Perhaps a flaw with the storytelling, or perhaps the other team members already knew what to expect and how to control the zombie-morphing when it eventually happened, so everyone was well-prepared for it.  Still, when the one guy eventually turned into a zombie, it caught everyone by surprise, so I'm led to think it was a storyline mistake on the part of the writers.<br /><br />Anyway, other parts of the film that I loved were the vicious blood-covered diseased dogs. They looked and acted VERY similar to the way they were in the older RE video games, and I appreciate that.<br /><br />Overall, lots of shooting, lots of action, lots of hot babes playing main character roles, haha. I really liked this movie. Just please understand that turning the Resident Evil video game series into an action movie is the most effective way to win over the majority of the people, since most people out there prefer action films over survival horror (which requires a greater attention span to follow). It's just more satisfying watching some vicious looking creature get shot to death instead of watching the main characters crawl through quiet places with hardly no action to satisfy most peoples needs.  It build suspense sure, but that's not what most people want.</p></body></html>

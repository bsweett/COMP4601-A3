<meta name="summary" content="Gory Good Fun. Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" Is A Spectacular, Blood-Soaked Thrill-Ride."></head><body><p>Tim Burton breathes new life to the macabre tale of the tormented Ichabod Crane. I have not read the original story but I am a big fan of the classic Disney version and noticed that Burton changed several aspects of the story. The wimpy, laughable, big-nosed school teacher of the original is turned into a sophisticated, charming New York City constable who is called upon by the townspeople of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the mysterious, gruesome be-headings of it's residents. Besides countless severed heads, there is a lot Tim Burton throws at the audience and it's all done with the Burton style that his fans find irresistible. Very few can deny the fact that this film looks great from every angle. It's dark, dreamlike atmosphere will inspire awe and dread. From the sinister, mutated trees to the lurking fog that envelopes the dreary landscapes. There isn't a horror movie in recent memory that is this visually spellbinding. The cast is also first-rate. Johnny Depp is in sharp contrast physically to the quirky character depicted in the Disney version or the Jeff Goldblum 1980 film but he is very believable in the role and Christina Ricci's pale, angelic beauty shines even amidst all of the bloodshed. But one of the best characters in the film is the incomprehensible, vicious "headless" horseman portrayed by the great and always compelling, Christopher Walken.<br /><br />Parents should take note that despite the fantastic fantasy elements depicted in this film and the quirkiness of the main characters, "Sleepy Hollow" is definitely not for children. The film leaves nothing to the viewer's imagination and the violence and imagery is graphic. Some may find it disturbing. But for those old enough and who are fans of the original story and/or of Burton, Depp and Ricci, need to check this out. It's an incredibly violent excursion into a gothic world of witches, black magic and the walking dead. And thanks to the creative genius of Tim Burton, it's never dull.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

THE AVENGERS await us! (In theaters, 2012.) It is a pity, because I thought that as the 'final' word on Captain America movies, this would rise to the occasion. It's a bit ... meh. Recall that we waited years for this stupid thing to come to fruition - and this is what they give us.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011) is one of those bizarre films that just doesn't seem destined for success, despite its production values. As the latest iteration (the list includes one film just a few years old) I ask: Is this overproduced? B-quality? A morbid fixation?<br /><br />Chris Evans is stunning in his beauty and manliness; why not present him in the best package available? So, it could be all or none of the abovementioned.<br /><br />Chris Evans is a comic-book-film regular. He's already done both the FANTASTIC FOUR films, PUSH, THE LOSERS, and SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD. See my reviews for PUSH and PILGRIM. His involvement in THE AVENGERS will be his 9th or 10th involvement in a comic book project.<br /><br />Here we have the story of Capt. America, beginning with what looked to me like Chris Evans' head rotoscoped onto the body of a thin 16-year-old boy. This is to put across his short, '98-LBS.-weakling' status. More amazing overproduction: what I described is what they wanted to do; what they did instead was digitally shrink and shrivel poor Chris. Beyond that, it is one of the most singularly boring back stories I've ever seen - there's some humor in it to lighten the load. I leave the rest of this mostly silly, empty story for you to discover.<br /><br />I will confine my review to random observations:<br /><br />1. Hugo Weaving makes an excellent Red Skull, with a flawless German accent. (Yes, I know he pronounced a "v" word with a "w" sound. Germans occasionally do that.)<br /><br />2. The production is great.<br /><br />3. Hitler should not have been left out of this.<br /><br />4. Stan Lee's cameo: brilliant!<br /><br />5. Dominic Cooper (as Howard Stark) is CUTE. I loved him as Sky in MAMMA MIA. Much easier on the eyes than his cinematic son Robert Downey, Jr.<br /><br />6. This film made me wonder: is Captain America just a wee bit gay? Of course when I ask that, it is meant as a COMPLIMENT. He should have been gay. Another wasted opportunity. Small-minded, cowardly America!<br /><br />7. Don't hold your breath waiting for any really good lines, or intelligent ones.<br /><br />8. Toby Jones, who is used as a prop here, deserves better than this. In fact, so does Hugo Weaving. Lord bless them, they acted their hearts out, though!<br /><br />9. This film actually did answer a burning query I'd had: THE AVENGERS (is that the right title?) will be released in May 2012. All the dopey films, such as THOR, have ended by saying the main character will return in THE AVENGERS or THE JUSTICE LEAGUE or POSSIBLY GAY HUNKS IN TIGHTS or whatever it is. (Remember what I said about "gay".)<br /><br />10. Much as I love him, I am so tired of seeing Samuel L. Jackson popping into the post-credits as Nick Fury. OK, WE GET IT!!<br /><br />You can tell what a bore certain films are, when you consider the things crossing your mind as being much more fascinating than the film. Waiting for something, anything really, to happen - I just waited til the end of the film. In that, it matches the far better <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005H9B2CE">Thor</a> (see my review): just another stepping stone of a film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Marvelous and Touching Second Sequel"></head><body><p>"Toy Story 3" has the familiar voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and most of the regular all star cast.  This third tale continues about the toys, Woody, Buzz and Jessie, plus all their pals is touching and emotional.  Seeing Andy, their owner, grown up and leaving for college, no longer needing them is sad.  His childhood has past, there are pictures in his room of former play-times with the toys, but the toys are now packed away to be stored in the attic.  The toys strike out on their own and end up at a Day Care Center with rough play times and the tough Teddy Bear boss, makes sure they stay.<br /><br />What happens when boys grow up and toys are no longer needed?  The answer is sweet, surprising and satisfying for all the "Toy Story" fans.<br /><br />The movie is perfection in the Pixar animation, beautiful colors and cinematography, plus adventure and smart doses of comedy.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p></body></html>

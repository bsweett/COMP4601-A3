<meta name="summary" content="A massive clunker."></head><body><p>Pirates of the Caribbean was the most disappointing film of summer 2003 because it promised more fun than it actually delivered. The Hulk comes in a close second because its pedigree (from the cast to director Ang Lee) would seemingly indicate we'd get a film that's far superior to the final cut of this horribly overlong clunker.<p>Maybe the Hulk was never suited for big screen material, but it's more likely Ang Lee just mucked up the execution. He clearly wants to inject his films with the deeper meaning, to question and explore the very psyche of the film's protagonist, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana). Truth be told, I'm not partial to this approach, but I could grudgingly accept it if delivered and executed competently. It's not.<p>From the dull performances to the pretentious tone, Hulk consistently does little more than make the viewer every bit as angry as the green beast himself, only because one was foolish enough to actually fork over some hard-earned cash to see the film.<p>Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that Lee wants to put characters over action, an approach that has constantly appealed to me, but there's a catch here; not one single character is likeable and/or sympathetic. Bana is a decent actor, but he radiates zero screen presence or charisma as Banner, I neither felt nor cared for his supposed mental and physical anguish.<p>As his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly is even less convincing, resorting to little more than shedding tears when the situation goes awry. Connelly is one of those actresses whose marked improvements over the years (she was an awful actress from the mid-80's to early 90's) has impressed me, but this is her worst performance in years. In other supporting roles, Josh Lucas is okay but perfunctorily one-dimensional as the villain, and Sam Elliot does his gruff thing yet again, and it's not nearly as amusing here as it was in We Were Soldiers (where much of it was played for laughs; he's deadly serious here). Nick Nolte is hilariously over-the-top as mad scientist Bruce Banner, it'd be amusing if it wasn't so earnest.<p>The movie as a whole is about anger, that seething, boiling rage lurking under the surface just waiting for the catalyst that'll unleash its ugly face. There is, unfortunately, only so much a film of this sort can do to deal with such a topic, and it doesn't even maximize such potential during the action sequences.<p>The Hulk (the big man himself) is a passable special effect, better than you'd expect, but not as good as you'd hope for, and while the green lug does get in a few pretty cool moments (leaping around the desert, for instance), he's utterly wasted in this movie's few paltry action sequences. There's a general rule of thumb of mine that any superhero action movie should pit our hero against stronger villains (a rule the recent X2 also broke). Not the case here, where most of Hulk's fighting is against the U.S. military. This is without mentioning that the Hulk not only has super strength and super agility, he's also practically invulnerable to harm because of a quick healing factor; a hero who virtually can't die? Bye-bye, suspense.<p>The one scene where the Hulk does fight someone with superior powers to his own is set in the dark, and I could barely make anything out during this battle, which hardly lasts past a minute and is wholly anti-climactic compared to the slightly more engaging Hulk vs. the military confrontation.<p>Danny Elfman's horrible score rounds out the rest of this lackluster picture. It's a rip-off of his own work in Spider-Man, which itself was a rip-off of his superior work in Batman. Lesson to Elfman: a score of this style won't work for every superhero.<p>Ang Lee crafts the film with a &quot;wink-wink&quot;-style camerawork, splicing in lots of comic-book style scene transitions, reminding viewers they are indeed watching an adaptation of a popular comic book. Not only are the transitions themselves annoying, but they're a persistent reminder of how much more fun it would be to actually skim through an issue of the Hulk than to actually watch this film.</p></body></html>

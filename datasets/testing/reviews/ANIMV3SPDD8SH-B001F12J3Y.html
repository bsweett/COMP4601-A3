In "The Polar Express", the only conflict that exits is the threat of losing your belief, in Santa Claus. Adults may add their own metaphor. No evil plot to conquer The North Pole, no reindeer catastrophe, no elves picketing for better working conditions, no, this is serious Santa. What we all understand about the famous, "Yes, Virginia, There Is A Santa Claus", newspaper editorial, (it's always been my cynical belief that a brilliant editor made up the letter), is laid out here in bloated bubble-gum fashion. Somehow wallowed in the sentiments and styles of the first half of the 20th Century, the film is about a magical train to The North Pole, and if nothing else, they got the transport right, sometimes the train ride to Santa Land is as redundant as a train ride to Buffalo.<br /><br />"The Polar Express" is filmed with animated real actors, apparently playing opposite a 'blue screen', and then swallowed up by it, like that dreadful Aha! video from decades ago, and the effect is like a more mature, thoughtful Gumby, or a decrepit Davy and Goliath, (it was a clay-motion religious children's show in the early '60's, and those who have seen it will never be the same.) Great care is given to detail the facial psychological grimaces of the boy who hops aboard The Polar Express, to see for himself if Santa is real, but the 'extra' kids on the train, seem ridiculously unable to react or interplay with the few speaking characters with dialogue, like if they spoke, the producers would have to pay them imaginary scale, or the animators would have to move their mouths. When a magical train ticket, (nothing is left un-magic-ized), is lost out the window of the train to the wind, the film uses exquisite filming technique to record its journey up mountains, down rivers, free-falling and swirling in snow squalls, and it is a very nice, worthless to the story, bit of Fantasia. Likewise, the boxcar tramp who appears to the boy in times of peril, like a cowboy from heaven, is a nice touch, but the idea, like the tramp, disappears in a puff of smoke.<br /><br />The final North Pole Christmas climax extravaganza, looked to me, given its 1940's heart, like a horrific German youth for Hitler rally, with thousands of elves dominating the city, (mean mothers, too), like a Karl Marx industrial nightmare, and what seemed an entire civilization vowing allegiance to dictator Santa.<br /><br />Suffice to say, "The Polar Express" doesn't compare to the humblest Christmas pageants, say, TV's "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer", which seems to have the same earnest warm Christmas thoughts in mind, and accomplishes the sentiment that The Polar Express, all lights flashing, and whistles blowing, roars through. Will kids like this movie? I think they will. Will they hold it precious through their lives? There's the rub.</p></body></html>

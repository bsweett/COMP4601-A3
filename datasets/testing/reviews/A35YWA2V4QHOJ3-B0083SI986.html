He lives in a run-down section of Detroit (please pardon my redundancy!).  Walt is a crotchety old hermit who would like everyone to believe that he is cold & heartless.  Just one problem:  in spite of a rough exterior, Walt has a heart of gold!<br /><br />At his wife's funeral he finds that his two sons & their families are selfish & narcissistic.  They only care for Walt insofar as the property they will inherit from him after he passes away.  Not exactly solace for a man who has worked hard all of his life!<br /><br />Juxtaposed with his self-centered family are Oriental neighbors who live around Walt.  After inadvertently rescuing a young man from the attack of a gang, Walt becomes something of a hero to his neighbors.  Unlike his own family, who could care less about him, the racist retired Ford worker finds them to be eternally thankful to them, and much more gracious than his own family would  ever dream of being.<br /><br />This is the outline of the film.  In some ways, it is a little bit like a raw, violent, downtown Detroit version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ASOC">Finding Forrester</a>.  To be sure, the thugs in the film are unreasonable in every way ~ straight out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012XIGXC">Gangland: The Complete Season One</a>.  They're not much in the brains department, but their anarchist approach to life makes them scary dudes.<br /><br />One of the more remarkable things about this movie is just how ordinary all of the characters are.  These are people all of us have dealt with in our everyday lives ~ both good & bad.  There are no supermodel actresses in the film, & there is no lush scenery.  It's just Clint Eastwood and the drab scenery of the city of Detroit (I've been there myself, and it's hardly a scenic locale).  These aspects are not a negative of the movie, but rather they just drive-home how much the film depicts the life of everyday personas.<br /><br />I swear that Clint Eastwood's scowl is every bit as much of a cinematic icon as the starship Enterprise, Andie MacDowell's smile, "shaken, not stirred" & "I'll be back."  Clint is about the only thespian I know of who can wear a frown on his face the entire movie and still(!) portray a likeable character.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of Clint's, this instant-classic is a must-see.  For myself, this is my very favorite CE movie.  If you're not a big fan of his style, this DVD just might compel you to change your mind about the big fella!</p></body></html>

Not to be taken seriously."></head><body><p>This lighthearted romp of a caper movie is a remake of the successful 1960s film staring Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Las Vegas Rat Pack. The title refers to the name of the lead character, Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, who assembles a team of 11 men to steal $180 million from a casino. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film is a slick spoof all the way, the high profile cast being the glue that holds this film together. There's Brad Pitt and Matt Damon and Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner. And there was no expense spared on the wardrobe or the glittery sets or the use of modern high tech special effects. Forget about the story; it's not supposed to be real. But yet there's fast paced action and tension throughout as the cast deals with setbacks and complications leading up to and including the caper. It's fun all the way. Just relax and don't take it seriously.</p></body></html>

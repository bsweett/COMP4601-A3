<meta name="summary" content="Excellent film!  A must have!!!"></head><body><p>Albeit fictional, this film has raised my curiosity tremendously about Mozart's life.  I have known his music & found the film even more entertaining with his pieces played here & there.  <p>F. Abraham played Salieri to perfection, portraying him as a scheming person but not one-dimensional as he was eqaully able to show how muich he respected Mozart's works.  Beneath that jealous ridden individual was a devoted person both to God & to his craft.  T. Hulce wouldn't be outdone being W.A. Mozart, a very gifted musician though quite immaturish in his living.  <p>At the end, my heart went to both of them.  For Mozart who did not live to reap the reputation he so deserved & to Salieri for living the rest of his life in guilt.<p>A highly recommended film!</p></body></html>

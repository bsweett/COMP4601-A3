<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best of 2007"></head><body><p>Jason Reitman's 2007 film Juno became a audience favorite and the little film that could. Juno penned by Diablo Cody ( who incidently took home the Best Screenplay Oscar) tells the story of a pregnant 16 year old detour into adulthood.<br /><br />Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a normal teenager who finds herself pregnant and faced with life changing choices. With her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) she sets out to find the perfect adoptive parents for her child. What she finds are the Lorings (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). The Lorings are confronted with their own issues as to what it means to be adults and parents.<br /><br />The film walks the thin line between comedy and drama quite well. The script is pitch perfect and the acting by the strong ensemble cast is a joy to watch. The film attempts to show individuals as humans not just cardboard cut-outs.<br /><br />The Blu Ray disc that I viewed presented a crystal clear picture and near perfect sound. The disc also features a ton of extras that enhance the viewing experience. Of especial note are the commentary by Reitman and Cody and the featured deleted scenes. This film was one of the sleepers of 2007 and should not be missed.</p></body></html>

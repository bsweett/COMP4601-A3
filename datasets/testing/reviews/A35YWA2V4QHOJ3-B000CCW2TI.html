You remember him, right?  He used to mainly do horror flicks such as the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series.  This movie proves that his talents are more diverse than some may have imagined.<br /><br />The star of the show, however, is Rachel McAdams.  She is an up-and-coming starlet in Hollywood and I'm a HUGE fan of her's.  She is absolutely gorgeous, AND she has remarkable acting abilities AND (on top of all that!) she has  a genuine screen presence.  In the latter two regards, she's basically the antithesis of Paris Hilton.  Also, every time I see her in a movie I have this insatiable appetite to give her a great big hug as she's so adorable.  :)<br /><br />In this film, she plays a vulnerable hotel manager who has a very rude person sitting next to her on a redeye flight.  Doesn't sound like a big deal, right?  Well, in this case she finds out that she must decide matters of life and death.  If this piques your curiousity, pick up the DVD!<br /><br />I do hope that Ms. McAdams flourishes in Hollywood, and I see no reason why she shouldn't.  Of course, I thought Tawny Kitean had a lot of potential early in her career too, but she never made nearly as many movies as I would have liked.  Hopefully Ms. McAdams will be around for the long-haul.  Too many Hollywood film stars base too much on their physical good-looks and too little on their acting skills.  This actress is an exception to that unfortunate rule!</p></body></html>

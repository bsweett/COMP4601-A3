<meta name="summary" content="First-rate intelligent drama. Kidman has never looked better"></head><body><p>The movie "The Interpreter" is the first ever to be filmed inside the actual United Nations Manhattan complex and the inside look at the building, hallways and conference rooms is a main attraction for me and a show how important and powerful Hollywood has become. Take for instance the 1959 thriller "North by Northwest." Denied at the time even the chance to film the exterior of the building Hitchcock's people had to resort to covert means to grab the shot of Cary Grant approaching the entrance (legend has it that the camera was concealed in a van.<br /><br />So here we are almost a half-century later and the United Nations opens up its doors and they couldn't have chosen a more intelligent and globally relevant, classy effort by veteran moviemakers.<br /><br />The story begins with simultaneous translator Silvia Bloome (Nicole Kidman) overhearing a whispered exchange in Ku, the little-known language of the fictional South African nation of Matobo. The message may signal an assassination attempt on Matobo's President Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), soon to arrive at the U.N. to defend himself against charges of in humane acts.<br /><br />The threat activates the Secret Service's Dignitary Protection Squad, in particular Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), a troubled and weary man soon fencing with the glacial, guarded and lonely Silvia.<br /><br />Is Dr. Zuwanie a patriot or a terrorist? Is Silvia herself a target or a sleeper? The trail leads to immigrant walk-ups and a Central Park rendezvous. The players assemble -- Zuwanie's head of security Lud (Jesper Christensen), his political enemies Kuman-Kuman (George Harris) and Xola (Curtiss Cook), plus a photographer who has seen too much (Yvan Attal). Bodies begin to accumulate. The key is in what Keller will be able to extract from Silvia's murky past as their private lives begin to merge.<br /><br />"The Interpreter" builds a creditable sense of claustrophobia and dread, with the occasional heart-thumping spike, but is more often a long stall with the phrase "It's got nothing to do with you" used once too often. This is one movie where unraveling the plot complexities may need a second viewing, but no matter because Pollack is one of the best in the business.<br /><br />That face, that marvelous face -- Penn's, of course -- with its furrowed brow and great pendulous nose. His Keller has a nothing-left-to-lose swagger to his walk, and we soon figure out why.<br /><br />"Interpreter" also gets mileage out of Kidman, perhaps as beautiful as ever she has been with her low, richly sculpted voice and schoolboy clothes. That's another of the problems: Both of them are gamin and tousled. This movie is said to be a make-or-break for her after some problems in recent duds and I would lay my bets on her emerging from this springs movie  lineup in good shape.<br /><br />To get to the sophisticated stuff, we will have to swallow a plot implausibility or two, beginning with why conspirators would discuss their plans in the General Assembly.<br /><br />It's too bad; the movie throws out scenes of unexpected power, for example, when, on a dusty African road, two men with an agenda pass a man with no eyes.<br /><br />Will a summer-primed audience accept a thriller without action, an adult, if dry, psychodrama? Only time will tell, but I think this will be mentioned in future promo's for other movies when the posters of other features proclaim loudly "From the Director of The Interpreter."</p></body></html>

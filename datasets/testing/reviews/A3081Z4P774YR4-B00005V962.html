<meta name="summary" content="Not A Bad Con."></head><body><p>"Ocean's Eleven" is one of those films that does not attempt to be a stirring social commentary or a barrage of poop jokes that's supposed to be a comedy (although there is only one joke involving human waste in this film).  It is simply meant to entertain, and it does just that.  George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a paroled thief who decides to rob a major casino owner (played by Andy Garcia) of his casino's earnings during a boxing match.  He assembles a crew of eleven theives to pull of the heist, but why would he want to go through with this seemngly impossible job?  Is it because of the $160 million dollar pay off?  Or maybe it's because his ex-wife (Julia Roberts) happens to be the casino owner's new girl?  What do you think?  This movie manages to put together a nice ensemble for our crew (including Bernie Mac as a con artist, Carl Reiner as an aging thief, Don Cheadle as a explosives expert, and many, many others) and the solid performances and brilliant dialogue managed to keep this movie from being an empty, flashy caper flick and makes it an enjoyable, flashy caper flick.  The DVD itself has some nice additional stuff, including a commentary with the director and writer (dry, but funny nonetheless) and one with several of the stars (such as Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, and Matt Damon) that's just as fun.  Definitely worth a look-see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A surprisingly good movie"></head><body><p>This movie has a couple of themes or leassons. It is a boy meet girl movie. The boy is John Clasky who is played well by Adam Sandler. And the girl is Flor played by Paz Vega who steals the scene even when not speaking. The two of them are great parents and who have the well fare of their children at heart. The movie is also one that also shows how imporatnt it is to be a good parent. John Clasky is also a very good and decent man.<br /><br />Adam Sandler's wife in this movie is played by Tea Leoni whose nervous energy and fantastic acting brings this complex character to the screen. She plays a typical American woman who had a fantastic carrer and tried to be a mother as well. And as the movie shows that is not an easy task to do both, almost impossible. And her mother is played by Cloris Leachman, who has the same nervous energy of Tea. Which makes it very believable that she is her mother.<br /><br />The movie starts with Flor who has recently immigrated to L.A. from Mexico, and is trying to find a better life for her remarkable daughter, Cristina played by Shelbie Bruce. Which brings me to another central part of the movie, the cultural difference between Americans and Hispanics. This movie has a couple of themes or lessons. It is a boy meet girl movie.

Which brings me to another central part of the movie, the cultural difference between Americans and Hispanics. The sacrifice that a Hispanic parent will make for their children is just natural, giving up everything in order to give their children a better life.<br /><br />The movie is shown and narrated from the point of view of Christina. It is a drama that has humorous moments. The only thing that actually would have made this movie better for me is if I did not understand Spanish, for it then would have emphasized what Flor had to deal with. This movie is worth watching. This has all the actors involved at their best.</p></body></html>

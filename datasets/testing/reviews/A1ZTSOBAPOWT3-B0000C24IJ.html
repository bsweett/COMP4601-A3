<meta name="summary" content="Right 'Turn'"></head><body><p>Some goofy kids take a &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; into some West Virginia woods and then all hell breaks loose. Those mountain men weren't that hideous, a lot of people look like that when they wake up in the morning. Really, this is a standard horror film, but it has its moments. The nasty brothers have a poor diet and they eat mysterious meat, tasty. There should've been a local dentist in town to help those poor boys. Well, everyone gets it except for the main guy (Desmond Harrington) and the main girl (Eliza Dushku) and they manage to blow up the incest house standing a few feet from the gas can. Is he crazy? He could've blown himself out of his own shoes. Kind of silly, but oh well.</p></body></html>

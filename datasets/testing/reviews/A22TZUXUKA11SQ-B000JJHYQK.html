When it comes out that there's a mole in the Secret Service, and that this person is in on a plot to assassinate the president, Garrison becomes a suspect. It's up to him to prove his innocence, and find the mole, before the president gets killed.<br /><br />This movie was action-packed and entertaining the whole way through. I was on the edge of my seat trying to figure out who the mole is and hoping that Garrison didn't get himself killed in his efforts to find the guy. Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria are excellent as the agents tracking Garrison, and Kim Basinger shines in a rare role as the First Lady. For anyone who likes political thrillers like the ones often starring Will Smith or Harrison Ford, the Sentinel will be right up your alley.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DISAPPOINTING!"></head><body><p>A friend of  mine recommended this movie to me. He told me this<br /><br />movie was great. Needless to say, I'll never listen to him<br /><br />again! The first hour was so boring, I almost shut it off. The<br /><br />second half just kept getting more, and more stupid.(SPOILER)<br /><br />There was no need for the boy to get shot and killed, and for<br /><br />the father to kill himself. With these things added to the<br /><br />movie, it still sucked!  THANKS MARC!</p></body></html>

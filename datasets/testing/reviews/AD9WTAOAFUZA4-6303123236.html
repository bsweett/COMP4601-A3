<meta name="summary" content="A Disney Classic With a DVD that SOARS"></head><body><p>As wonderful as &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; still is - decades after its theatrical release, younger audiences may find its animation flat and uninspired.  Blame DISNEY itself for that, since in the past 20 years, the studio has released equally timeless tales that far exceed this film's technical qualities.  Nowhere here will you find the depth and 3-dimensional elements of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; or the sheer grandeur of &quot;The Lion King.&quot;  And, SNow White's operatic vocal inflections can be grating at times, I admit.  Still - this is pure Disney magic, sure to be enjoyed for decades to come!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A very effective turn on the commoner and the princess"></head><body><p>This is very romantic movie and is an interesting variant on the old theme of the talented and ambitious commoner and a beautiful princess falling in love, but she is promised to a prince she does not love.  The forces of the Universe keep them apart.  How can their love be fulfilled?  In this case, the ambitious commoner is an illusionist, a magician.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of Chief Inspector Uhl (played wonderfully by the always wonderful Paul Giamatti).  The narration comes as he provides a report to Prince Leopold (played with just the right sinister touch by Rufus Sewell) about what is known of the life of Eisenheim the Illusionist (mysteriously and romantically played by Edward Norton).  Although, the narration isn't quite comprehensive because we get to see things that the Inspector does not know.  However, we don't quite notice all this until after the film is over.  The movie keeps us in the moment quite effectively and we pretty much accept what we see as we go along.  This is just like the way we watch magic tricks.  We are looking for the way it is done, but the magician knows we are looking and uses that as part of his ability to divert our attention.<br /><br />It is important that I do not reveal any more about the story because learning the story as we watch it is the whole fun of a Romance such as this.  I will say that I loved the mood of the thing.  The actors are all fine. Jessica Biel as Sophie is the perfect love for Eisenheim.  She is able to be not only desirable, but has a common touch despite her regal carriage.  We can believe she is royal and that she would recognize and desire the noble love of a common cabinetmaker's son over the plans and political machinations a marriage to a prince would offer.<br /><br />Also, the quality of Aaron Johnson's portrayal of Eisenheim and Eleanor Tomlinson as the young Sophie need to be recognized. They have to convince us of the love and connect us to the adult characters.  They do so well that we know these are the same two people as adults without any faltering in belief.<br /><br />The music of Philip Glass is perfect for this film.  It adds just the right emotional connections and helps to tell a story that uses images as much as it uses words.<br /><br />A pretty darn good film.</p></body></html>

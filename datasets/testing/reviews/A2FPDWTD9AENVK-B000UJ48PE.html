<meta name="summary" content="Hostel: Part 2"></head><body><p>Another three students that are traveling abroad decide to make a detour to Slovakia for a week of fun and partying, but this group of girls will soon become the next victims of an underground hunting organization that specializes in human torture! Conceptually, HOSTEL: PART 2 was the perfect direction for Eli Roth to take the series, since it fully exposes the inner workings of the Elite Hunting Group by bringing the audience up close and personal with two of its members. While this portion of the film is pulled off to some degree, the half involving the girls and their struggle to survive falls completely flat. Unlike the guys in the original, Lauren German and Bijou Phillips are emotionally distant from their roles, and their acting is far more apparent. It feels every bit like a rushed production that falls back on repetitive storytelling techniques with less interesting characters. Even the worn and washed out appearance looks like it was shot on cut-rate film stock. The biggest disappointments come as the plainly obvious twists in the end that are repeatedly alluded to throughout the entire picture. With HOSTEL: PART 2, it seems as though Roth was forced to sequelize against his will, and it shows. One can only hope that the series ends here before the idea is beaten to a pulp like in the SAW franchise.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></body></html>

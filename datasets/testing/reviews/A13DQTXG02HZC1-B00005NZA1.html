Shamayalan has done just that.  It's very easy, really by providing audience with hints little by little until we get the whole story in the end.  His style of directing is rather unique too: dark &amp; sombre background as always, slow frames, focal attention towards the main characters for character development purpose, fitting soundtrack by James Newton Howard.  If you want to enjoy this movie, it's better you watch by not knowing anything from the beginning.  Otherwise, the essence of the whole movie would be lost.  I'm unsure if this movie could hold up for the next 2 sequels or if we would be fed up with this format of directing by  then.  The only downside I could see from this movie is that Robin Penn Wright should be given more chance to do her share.  We weren't told why her character in the movie started to drift apart from her husband character aka Bruce Willis...Definitely worth watching to kill hours but I still think the plot should be darker and heavier than comic book connections.</p></body></html>

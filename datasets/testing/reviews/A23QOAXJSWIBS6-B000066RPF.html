<meta name="summary" content="Classic film, average DVD"></head><body><p>Yes, this is, without a doubt, one of the funniest films ever made.  Python's classic humor has highly influenced untold numbers of comedians (including the original SNL cast) and several generations of movie fans who like their humor a bit more witty than most of what passes for comedy in Hollywood these days.<p>Why I did not give this DVD 5 stars is the lack of extra features.  There is a director's commentary out there--I heard it years ago on Comedy Central!<p>This sad fact aside, the color has been brilliantly restored to the print, which is usually washed out.  The sound is nicely preserved as well.<p>When they get around to releasing a DVD worthy of this fine film, I will be glad to give it as many stars as possible.</p></body></html>

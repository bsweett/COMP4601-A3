In 19 years we've all become more jaded & a lot harder to impress with obvious but great special effects. Even so I recommend seeing this on the big screen because those special effects are that good. However, seeking out crystal skulls that may or may not have existed are not as compelling as the Ark of the Covenant & the Holy Grail. As we have changed so has Indy. He is no longer a treasure hunter plundering other countries antiquities, for $$$ & his favorite museum's glory. He is seeking to return a crystal skull, gain knowledge & prevent the greedy commies from getting it. Bringing back his old girlfriend, Marion, was a really nice touch. In a minor plot she also had a son that is Indy's. He becomes Indy's sidekick & you could see that coming a mile off. Cate Blanchett is somewhat miscast vamping it up as a Garboesque villian. That had to be done deliberately. A great summer movie & it should win the season unless the ladies rally around the ultimate chick flick, Sex & the City.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best Of The Bond Extravaganza"></head><body><p>Many will argue over which is the best bond movie in the franchise . If you like gadgets, cars with impressive arsenals and catchy names with double entendre than more than likely you're favorite Bond movie might be "Goldfinger". As for me, I prefer "From Russia with Love (1963)" over Goldfinger, just for the quality that From Russia with Love is more plausible and realistic. Now that does not mean I dislike Goldfinger, on the contraire I think its #2 in the bond franchise, leaving # 3 to "Casino Royale".<br /><br />Goldfinger is the first Bind film to introduce gadgets to the series, aside from the storable rifle in "From Russia with Love" here in "Goldfinger we see for the first time the Aston Martin DB5; equipped with all the necessary gadgets for traffic alleviation, enemy destruction, and why not, impress the girls on the way. Goldfinger is also the first 007 movie to have a title sequence with actual lyrics in it; neither two previous films had words in the music, just orchestra. The famous title song is performed by Shirley Bassey, who would perform songs to the James Bond films Goldfinger (1964), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), and Moonraker (1979). She is the only singer to have recorded more than one James Bond theme song.<br /><br />The movie begins with an unforgettable entrance, a pre-title sequence that..Honestly really had nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but hey it works fabulously. Anyways, Auric Goldfinger is a gold smuggler, and a fanatic of gold..Hence Goldfinger. Bond is sent by M to investigate how Goldfinger manages to smuggle gold internationally; Bond later discovers that he is preparing a diabolical plan called "Operation Grand Slam" consisting of eradicating all gold in Fort Knox by A-Bombing it, leaving all the gold radioactive for 58 years and useless...except Goldfingers which he plans to keep and let it duplicate or triplicate its value.<br /><br />While the plot is a bit fantasy, newcomer to the franchise Guy Hamilton, he brings a magnificent touch of believable fantasy. Unfortunately subsequent Bond films tried to cash in on Goldfingers success by borrowing ideas and redoing the plot. Of course all attempts were futile, they were incomparable with Goldfinger. A perfect example would be "A View to a Kill (1985)" it presented a reminiscent plot, only difference instead of gold it was silicon, and instead of Fort Knox it was Silicon Valley. It didn't work, Goldfinger is a timeless classic that works perfect and is in my opinion the best of the extravaganza entries.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />DISC 1:<br />> feature film re-mastered in high definition, using the original negative to bring the image to its best possible quality, eliminating any dirt or flickering.<br />> Audio Commentary featuring Guy Hamilton<br />> Original Mono Track<br />> 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound<br />> 5.1 DTS Theater sound<br /><br />DISC 2<br /><br />> Sean Connery on the set of Goldfinger<br />> Screen tests<br />> On Tour with the Aton Martin DB-5<br />> Honor Blackman Open-Ended Interview<br />> Interactive Guide into The World Of Goldfinger<br />> The Making of Goldfinger<br />> The Goldfinger Phenomenon<br />> Original Publicity Featurette<br />> Original Trailers, T.V.

<meta name="summary" content="And here&#8217;s to you, Mrs. Richelieu&#8230;.."></head><body><p>This is a slightly above-average romantic comedy, but would have been much less so if it weren&#8217;t for the luminescence of the star power assembled by Rob Reiner.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston plays Sarah Huttinger, a cutesy-pie, ditsy and often confused young woman, who is engaged to a perfect man (Mark Ruffalo) but who is unsure of her feelings towards marriage.  Now living in New York, she and her fianc&eacute; travel to her hometown of Pasadena to attend her sister&#8217;s wedding, and while there, events lead Sarah to the shocking revelation that her family may have inspired the story of &#8220;The Graduate&#8221;, and that the timing of her birth raises a few questions about her biological father.<br /><br />Her mother having passed away when she was nine, Sarah confronts her grandmother (a show-stealing brilliantly cast Shirley MacLaine), and then sets off on a man-hunt for Beau Burroughs (an unbelievably charming and entertaining Kevin Costner), the man who inspired the Benjamin Braddock character.<br /><br />Doing her detective work efficiently, she tracks him to San Francisco, where he puts some of her fears to rest on the one hand, but stirs up a hornet&#8217;s nest with the other.  Her relationship with her fianc&eacute; deteriorates rapidly, but when she is called upon to calm her sister&#8217;s anxieties about marriage, she realizes that she should listen to herself sometimes on matters of the heart.<br /><br />A shaky script that is admirably supported by the cast, but all the kudos belong to Shirley MacLaine who made this movie watchable.<br /><br />Hey hey hey.- 3.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 12, 2006</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superficial and trite, this film doesn't do Marie Antoinette justice"></head><body><p>I take umbrage at the notion that I "just don't get it" if I don't think this is a five-star film. That's utter nonsense. I watched it, and I got it - and while some parts of it worked, overall, I found it unsatisfying.<br /><br />The film started with potential. It took great pains to demonstrate what Marie Antoinette was losing in order to forge an alliance with France. When she arrives at the French border, a tent straddles it. She enters the tent on the Austrian side, is forced to give up her dog and all of her clothes (everything Austrian), and she is garbed in French clothes and told that she can have as many French dogs as she likes. She exits on the French side, ready to meet the dauphin. A wonderful "show don't tell" example.<br /><br />I felt that far too much time was spent examining superficial aspects of her life. She spent money, she gambled. She spent too much money. She gambled too much. OK. She's a party girl. I get it. Later in the film, we find that she had three children, and then we are shown that one died in a scene that lasted for twenty seconds: a picture was hung on the wall that showed the Marie with three children; then it was taken down and replaced with a picture of Marie and two children. To some this might seem clever. I thought it was self indulgent. Her affair was glanced over, and her hatred in the hearts of the French people shown in a voiceover that echoed her most infamous quote: Let them eat cake. To a bored observer (I was watching the movie with one such), this is easily missed.<br /><br />The soundtrack, a mix of period music and New Order/Adam and the Ants/Bow Wow Wow seemed as confused as the movie. If something doesn't add anything - i.e., contemporary music to a period drama - then it doesn't belong. My feeling was that the music (all of which I'm a fan of, by the way) detracted from the story being told.<br /><br />So did the unconventional casting decisions. Jason Schwarzman as Louis XVI? Molly Shannon? Rip Torn? I have enjoyed each in other works, but they were as out of place as a mobster at a tea party.<br /><br />What did work were the costumes, the orgiastic parties of champagne and confections, and the portrayal of the queen as a tart. But this is, of course, a superficial examination. This was a skin deep movie that didn't attempt to dig. And Kirsten Dunst, another whose work I enjoy, didn't dig deep here. But that wasn't her fault. She wasn't given a shovel, and one can only do so much with their nails.<br /><br />2? stars rounded up to 3 for costumes and period evocation</p></body></html>

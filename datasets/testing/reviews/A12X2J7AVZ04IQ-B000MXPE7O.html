<meta name="summary" content="Big Build Up; Disappointing Delivery"></head><body><p>The trailers for "The Good Shepherd" looked really exciting; lots of action, etc. Apparently, all 2 minutes of action were packed into that trailer. This is not to say the film isn't worthy; it IS...on many levels. Matt Damon really is one of our current best actors, and he commands attention. The confusing time-shifts weren't helpful; don't know if that was a problem of director de Niro or the editor or writer. There's a terrifc cast, though Jolie was sorely miscast. Alec Baldwin & Damon had some good banter, as they did in "The Departed". I could watch a film with only those two, and be more entertained than all of "The Good Shepherd". The historical accuracy of this telling of the founding of the CIA is questionable, and putting it in the same league as Carol Reed's "The Third Man", or Demme's "Silence of the Lambs" cannot allow me to put this on my list of favorites. I admire Matt Damon a lot, and he's fine, but the overall result was disappointing for me. Apparently, I missed something, including the 2? hours of my life that were taken up, and I'm too old to waste the time.</p></body></html>

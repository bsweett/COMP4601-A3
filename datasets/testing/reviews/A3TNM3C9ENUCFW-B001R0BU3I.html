This is an entertaining cat and mouse bad guy / good guy? on the run from the government, hiding a bigger more sinister plot type yarn - it's of a  similar style to movies like Fugitive, and the more recent Body of Lies, but goes it's own (muddled at times) direction and is originally dramatic. All that said it tries to cover every angle of post 9/11 Terrorism fears and misinterpretations, and ends up a bit of a mess in places. You have the stereotypical CIA agent who's bigoted and roughs up suspects, and another with a PhD in Arabic Studies preaching tolerance. There are fanatical Islamics and Terrorists and also thinking Muslims. Being an American production, US foreign policy is only ever alluded too, or hinted at, Oil, Iraq and War don't get a mention for instance. Holding all this together is Don Cheadle, excellent and believable as ever as the main character Samir Horn. With an American Mom, Sudanese Father, highly trained skills learned in the Special Forces and strange allegiances that are ambiguous at best, you know you're in for a treat, as he is chased by (among others) the aforementioned PhD CIA Agent, played by Guy Pearce. I gave it four stars for a solid storyline, good action scenes, and top notch acting all round. I would have given it five, it it hadn't had tried so hard to represent EVERY possible angle and ideology on a very tangled subject.</p></body></html>

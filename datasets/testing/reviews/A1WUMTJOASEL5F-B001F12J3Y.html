To each his own.<br />You know, offhand, I think it would be very dreary if classic Christmas features began to resemble each other, or imitated each other, simply because there was an isolated working formula that pleased the mass audience. So I am really open to newness and fresh material, because great new features don't really take away from those beloved Christmas classics, but actually keeps the home fires burning.<br />So is with The Polar Express. I don't expect any Christmas fantasy or calamity to embrace all the possible angles of Christmas, but I do expect a heartfelt experiance.<br />Animation films are never required to be logical, and quite frankly, that is the extreme attractiveness of animation in the first place. You can get away with alot. If we demanded animation to be on the planes of logical procedures, Bugs Bunny would have been boiled in a stew in a heartbeat, but he always manages to get out of the most difficult situations, simply by kissing the most hardened foe. . . on the lips. THAT'S COMEDY! So I don't expect features like Polar Express to be entirely logical, just fairly to the point of speculation that IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED LIKE THIS on Christmas Eve.<br />The premise of children even leaving there warm homes into the stone cold with just a bathrobe in itself defies reality comprehension. So as long as I'm in the comfort of my own home watching children baring the winter Christmas Eve cosmos in jamies, is their problem.<br />Now I admit, that having a lone man luring children on to an unknown midnight vehicle is a bit suspicious, especially without talk of consent from their parents to do so, it is a well known fact that Peter Pan himself has used this same sort of scheme with Michael, John, and Wendy.<br />What else is new?<br />For the most part, it is also likely this could have been somewhat of a dream, but like The Wizard Of Oz, it is supposedly not because unlike poor Dorothy who only had Toto as a living witness, our main childhood focus here has a bit of hardcore evidence.<br />My main concern is that throughout all the angles of what if, and why did it happen this way blah, blah, blah. . . I liked this movie. ALOT!<br />It's beautiful to look at like a 3D Christmas traditional card opening up it's telltale magic for all those who want to (yes I'll say it) "Believe".<br />And what more do we need from the land of Christmas anyway?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If it bleeds it leads"></head><body><p>In a deliciously ironic scene from David Fincher's crime thriller, "Zodiac", San Francisco homicide investigator Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), stalks out of a screening of "Dirty Harry". He is appalled at what he sees as Hollywood's obvious and crass exploitation of a real-life case that has consumed his life-the hunt for the notorious and ever-elusive "Zodiac" serial killer, who terrorized the Bay Area for a good part of the 1970's. (Clint Eastwood's fictional nemesis in "Dirty Harry" was a serial killer who taunted the authorities and the media, and referred to himself as "Scorpio").<br /><br />That is one of the "little touches" in Fincher's multi-layered true crime opus that makes it an instant genre classic. The director has wisely eschewed the broad brush strokes of Grand Guignol that he slathered on in "Se7en" for a meticulously detailed etching that is equal parts Michael Mann and Stanley Kubrick, and thoroughly engrossing cinema.<br /><br />The director's notorious perfectionism serves the protagonists well-they are all obsessed individuals. The aforementioned Inspector Toschi and his partner Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards, in a nice comeback) are the type of dedicated cops that have could have strolled right out of an Ed McBain novel. Master scene-stealer Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as Paul Avery, the cocky crime reporter for the S.F.Chronicle who gloms on to the case; his "partner" of sorts is the Chronicle's political cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is the first person to connect the dots (thanks to his obsession with cryptograms and puzzles). The nerdish Graysmith eventually becomes the most obsessed of them all, conducting an independent investigation over two decades.<br /><br />Fincher has assembled a film that will please true crime buffs and noir fans alike. The combination of location filming, well-chosen period music and Fincher's OCD-like attention to detail recreates a cinematic vibe that I haven't experienced since the golden days of Sidney Lumet (think "Dog Day Afternoon", "Serpico" or "Prince of the City".)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Most Combative Audio Commentary ever!"></head><body><p>I didn't pick up "The Sum of all Fears" because I wanted to watch the movie.  I tried, and failed, to read the book a dozen years ago, though since then I've finished a couple of Clancy novels and seen most of the movies.  But when I heard that Clancy -- a tremendously feisty writer who posts to his own Usenet forum -- actually recorded an audio commentary for this DVD, along with the director, Phil Alden Robinson, I just had to be there.<p>The basics of the screenplay are weird.  An elegant European neo-Nazi, with a penchant for fine wine, classical music, and a vaguely non-denominational Austrian accent, inexplicably detonates a nuclear bomb in the middle of the Super Bowl, played in Montreal's Olympic Stadium, which for the movie's purposes is located in South Baltimore.  With me so far?  Good.  Me neither.<p>Clancy verbally abuses Robinson for most of the commentary track by telling him what the movie got wrong.  Mostly this relates to the misuse of boats and fighter planes, or incorrect military jargon.  Robinson takes it all well, calmly explaining his choices, and politely deferring to Clancy on all the minor points.  These two guys obviously share different political views, although it's odd that neither director commented on the 9/11 factor.  The book as written was a lot closer to the 9/11 scenario than the movie's watered-down plot.  Yet Clancy and Robinson never discuss the reasoning behind the change.  One of the more interesting revelations, though, is that the movie's US President (James Cromwell) is based on Michael Dukakis.  Clancy has high praise for Morgan Freeman and Liev Schrieber, but suggests that Bridget Moynihan, who plays Ben Affleck's love interest, needs to eat a couple of hot dogs every day.  Wow!<p>When the movie's over, Robinson tells Clancy it's been "an honor and a pleasure".  Clancy, not missing a beat, replies, "Well, I don't know if it was an honor".<p>You definitely don't want to miss this double act.</p></body></html>

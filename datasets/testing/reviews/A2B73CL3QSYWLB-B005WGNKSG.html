Once this superb thriller sinks it's claws into you those concerns go out with the bathwater.  This film works on two levels.  Primarily as a labarynthine mystery surrounding the disappearance of a sixteen year old girl in 1966.  Secondly it's a character study of the film's title character, Elsbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace).  As layers of Salander's past are revealed her mystique multiplies.  I haven't seen the other two films in the trilogy but after seeing Rapace's account of Salander I'm salivating at the mouth.  Currently they're prepping American versions of Stieg Larrson's novels from which these films are based.  That brings to my mind "La Femme Nikita" and it's lame American photocopy, "Point of No Return".  I hope when they translate these works for U.S. audiences they bring a little inspiration to the table and not money grubbing cynicism.</p></body></html>

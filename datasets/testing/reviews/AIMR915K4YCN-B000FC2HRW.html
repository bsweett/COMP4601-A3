This time, we get a horrific roller-coaster disaster, predicted by the lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Of course, the real fun begins when Death starts reaping the souls of those who have "escaped" their untimely demise.

I mean, surviving a catastrophe is supposed to be a "miracle", not a reason for further dread and terror! I get a kick out of these films and the way Death uses the machinery of everyday life in order to orchestrate our doom. The tanning-bed sequence is my favorite "accident" in this one!

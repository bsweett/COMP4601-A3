<meta name="summary" content=""The Second Best Stephen King Movie Adaption""></head><body><p>After "Dolores Clairborne", "The Green Mile" is without a doubt the best film adaption of a Stephen King story. Tom Hanks plays a prison warden in Florida during the Great Depression, and it is through Hank's character that we as an audience encounter many prison characters and prison officers, some good and some bad. The most interesting of all the characters in the film is John Coffey, played brilliantly by Michael Clark Duncan. Coffey is serving time in prison for raping and murdering two girls. However, we soon discover that Coffey is innocent. Coffey also has special healing powers, and once we know Coffey's background and innocence we root for him in his survival from being killed on death row.<br /> "The Green Mile" is one of the greatest prison films of all-time, and it ranks up there with "Midnight Express" and "The Shawshank Redemption". Both "The Green Mile" and "Shawshank" were directed by Frank Darabont and written by Stephen King.<br /> The special features on this outstanding two disc set include commentary by Darabount, two deleted scenes, a rare teaser trailer never before released, makeup tests of Tom Hanks, and Michael Clark Duncan's screen test. There is also an informative ninety minute documentary on the making of the movie.<br /> "The Green Mile" won four Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Micheal Clark Duncan.</p></body></html>

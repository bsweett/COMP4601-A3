She was shot in what seemed a random robbery-gone-wrong in a convenient store. There were four brothers even though they did not resemble each other a bit. All four were adopted by a murdered woman many years ago when she was a social worker and tried to find new homes for the children from dysfunctional families. Nobody wanted those four. She did. She took them in, brought them up, gave them love and support and they called her mom and themselves - brothers. Now she is dead, and the brothers start their own investigation on the dirty and often deadly streets of their childhood city to find those who were behind the murder. Very soon they discover that the robbery was a cover up for a hit murder. Someone wanted their mother dead and paid for her murder. Four brothers Mercer, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), the leader, the oldest, toughest, short- tempered, and stubborn; Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), the only family man of four who had taken care of the mother the last years; Angel (Tyres Gibson), the sexy one, and Jack (Garrett Hedlund), the youngest, whom three older brothers try to protect, are determined to avenge their mother's death no matter what it would cost. The film was directed by John Singleton as an urban thriller -revenge movie which is also a family drama, and I like it very much. It is violent, gritty, it moves well, it's got many plot turns on its way, it is packed with very effective dynamic action scenes, and acting is very good by all principal players. I was especially impressed by Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn as Victor Sweet, the pure evil despite his name. Ejifor said once, "I like to disappear into a role. I equate the success of it with a feeling of being chemically changed". The actor whom I first noticed in a compelling role of an illegal immigrant in London in the film Dirty Pretty Things (2002), was frightening in Four Brothers. I am also becoming a fan of Mark Wahlberg. He's got charisma and screen presence. The film does not fail to provide some humor, to show how much the four brothers mean to one another, and what the woman whom they lost meant to them. I missed the movie when it was released and actually did not know anything about it until this evening when its opening scene grabbed my attention; I began watching and did not leave until the credits started rolling.<br /><br />A bit of trivia: John Singleton is the youngest Oscar nominated director. He received the honors at the age of 24 after completing and releasing his directorial debut, the phenomenal Boyz n the Hood (1991) which was based on his own childhood in a LA ghetto. Where do you move if you start your career on such high note? Four Brothers may not be as great as Boyz n the Hood but it is a darn good and entertaining film.</p></body></html>

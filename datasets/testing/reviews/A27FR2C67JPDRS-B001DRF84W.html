<meta name="summary" content="A monster weekend...worth the hype?"></head><body><p>I've heard a number of mediocre reviews of this film and even several friends commented on the fact that the Hulk doesn't look "real" enough...so I went into the film with low expectations.  After seeing the film, I don't think "Hulk" is a bad film.  All the principle characters do well in there roles and I think Eric Bana does a decent job as the normally low-keyed Bruce Banner, a scientist, who has a monstrous rage lurking deep inside himself.  There were some moments when the story dragged a little and it is quite a while before you see the big green guy, but its an interesting look at a comic book character that isn't necessarily a hero...though he may do some good for people sometimes.  The CGI Hulk looked fine to me, more like the character from the pages of the Stan Lee comic and I thought it was pretty cool seeing him change from Bruce and back again.  My main problem with the film is the use of split screens, which after a while, became incredibly annoying.  I think director Ang Lee may have been trying to give us the feel of an actual comic book but in the end it was distracting.  Jennifer Connelly did good in her role, though there wasn't a good deal for her to do---I think she would make a terric Wonder Woman in the long postponed Warner Bros film that still has yet to be made.  I think next time a round it will be easier for the director to get right into the story now that he's established the Hulk's origin.  Nick Nolte was a little over the top for me but still did well as Banner's grungy and insane scientist father.  Josh Lucas (of Sweet Home Alabama) does a mean turn as another villain in the story.  Is it worth seeing...sure, its a summer blockbuster...a popcorn movie.  But lets hope next time around the Hulk is a bigger, badder misunderstood monster, with NO split screens!</p></body></html>

And like the original, this movie manages to blend its police-story crime elements with the suspense of a thriller and the tension and graphic content of horror.<br />By now, Jigsaw is taken into custody and being interviewed by the police, all while a new group of his victims are locked in a house and must find a way out before time runs out and they meet their death. Sounds interesting, right? Well if it sounds good, seeing it will take it to another level entirely, as the dirty fingers and chipped nails on the front cover suggest.<br />In comparison to the first "Saw", this movie is more graphic, gory and twisted. The small fire chamber, the needle pit and the wrist-cutting puzzle box all make up some gruesome scenes that really show you what a great horror movie can do. I'm sure at least one of those scenes, or others, will have you squirming! For me personally, it was the fire chamber scene that left me shuddering.<br />Also, while the original "Saw" had a great, dirty look to it, especially something in the use of the camerawork, this one takes it up again! While the original did have a gritty, raw feel to it, as opposed to polished camerawork of say, a foreign horror film, "Saw 2" gives the original a run for its money in that field.<br />In "Saw 2", the camerawork gets even rawer and grittier, giving it the shaky feel you may see when you're in a nightmare. There are some moments where, dare I say, it almost has a psuedo-snuff feel to it, much like the underground film series "August Underground". Dear Lord, I'll save that for another day!<br />But anyway, "Saw 2" is still able to find a genius balance between a smart police story and a gritty torture-thriller display. I really give the writers of this film credit, because not too many films can have that dual-personality medium and pull it off so well.<br />Well, that about wraps up this review. If you wanna watch "Saw 2", I might recommend you watch the original "Saw" before, just so you can understand what's going on. Hey, make it a double feature! Anyway, if you liked the original, or want to watch a "Saw" film, you'll love this! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

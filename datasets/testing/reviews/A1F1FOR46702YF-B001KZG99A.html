<meta name="summary" content="Superior Tech"></head><body><p>Director Jon Favreau (Zathura & Elf) brings Marvel Comics' armored superhero to the big screen in the first-rate comic book adventure "Iron Man". While demonstrating his company's newest weapon system, billionaire industrialist and genius inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by Middle Eastern terrorists and forced to build a powerful weapon. Instead, Stark secretly develops a suit of armor to escape his captives. Upon returning to the United States, a renewed Tony Stark is determined to amend his company's mistakes and improves his armor to become the high-tech superhero Iron Man. "Iron Man" is a superb crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster that ranks as one of the best superhero movies to date. The latest comic book adaptation delivers a well-paced storyline, excellent visual effects, good action sequences, a solid cast and great humor. Downey's entertaining performance as Tony Stark is one of the movie's biggest strengths. "Iron Man" also stars Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Academy Award-winner Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />"Iron Man" arrives on Blu-Ray with a fully loaded 2-disc Ultimate Edition that's a must-have for any Marvel Comics fan. The 2008 blockbuster is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is very impressive but not quite perfect. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio is excellent. "Iron Man" Ultimate Edition features two great documentaries: "I Am Iron Man" that offers an in-depth behind-the-scenes look in the development of the film, and "The Invincible Iron Man" that explores the origins of the Marvel Comics' character. Other bonus materials include four picture galleries, 11 deleted and extended scenes, theatrical trailers, "The Onion: Iron Man Trailer" gag short, actor Robert Downey Jr's screen test and "Hall of Armor" interactive feature. Overall, "Iron Man" Ultimate Edition scores an "A".</p></body></html>

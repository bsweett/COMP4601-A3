<meta name="summary" content="Great sound, mediocre DVD"></head><body><p>This is the DVD you bought your Dolby Digital or DTS sound system for.  Though primarily famous for its visual effects, this film has a highly active and creative surround soundtrack that should give your 5.1 speakers the most workout they ever got.  Compared to the old laserdisc's Dolby Prologic sound, the DD 5.1 sound (I haven't heard the DTS version) has much clearer and louder dialogs, much stronger and richer surround effects, and much better integration of dialogs, effects, and music, so they sound more cohesive to, and yet distinctive from, one another.  The sound effects span the entire frequency spectrum, from the deep bass of a triceratops' groaning, the earth-shaking tremble of a T-Rex's footsteps, to the shrill cries of a velociraptor. This is one DVD that really takes advantage of the newer sound formats.<p>The picture quality has nothing to complain about except the flesh tone on John Hammond looks a little too red at times, which was something I didn't see on the laserdisc.  There are only 20 chapter stops on the DVD, compared to 47 on the laserdisc.  The PCFriendly software that comes with the DVD appears to be an updated version, but it still causes frequent crashes to my PC.  Exclusive DVD-ROM features are nothing but web links, wallpapers, screensavers, and such; they are for Windows PCs only, but Mac users won't miss them.<p>The supplements on the DVD are good, but not great.  The '95 documentary &quot;The Making of Jurassic&quot; has been aired on TV countless times, but it does provide a nice recounting of how the visual effects got made.  The &quot;dinosaur encyclopedia&quot; includes only info on the dinosaurs that appear in the film, and some info is not accurate, such as the unproven claim that a dilophosaurus could spew venom.  The &quot;go-motion&quot; film clip of the &quot;kitchen attack&quot; scene done by Phil Tippett is very nice, and I wish more such clips were included.  (Although Tippett's clay model work was later replaced with computer graphics to his dismay, the clip shows that he contributed much to the scenes' visual style.)  There are camcorder video segments of a Spielberg-Winston pre-production meeting and a location-scouting session; both are noteworthy but superficial.  In a way-too-brief video segment called &quot;Foley Artists&quot;, a few sound artists demonstrate how certain sounds are recorded.  The best supplements, in my opinion, are the storyboard sequences of 5 dinosaur attack scenes, including 2 that were omitted from the film.  Storyboards are an excellent way to show how key shots were constructed and got translated into the finished film.  Other supplements include the usual production stills, cast &amp; crew bios, production notes.  There is no shooting script, no outtakes, no film clips of deleted scenes, no director's commentary.  Perhaps the biggest regret is there is not one word about DTS or Dolby Digital (in fact, the topic is rarely mentioned on any DVD).  It would be nice to mention at least what they do and what their advantages are, especially on a disc where DTS and DD are put to such good use.<p>The Jurassic Park DVD is sold in 3 versions: Widescreen/Dolby Digtal, Pan &amp; Scan/Dolby Digital, and Widescreen/DTS, but no Pan &amp; Scan/DTS. There is also a 2-pack edition that includes The Jurassic Park DVD and The Lost World DVD, and it comes in Widescreen/Dolby Digtal and Pan &amp; Scan/Dolby Digital versions, but no DTS version.  So make sure you order (and receive) the right copy.</p></body></html>

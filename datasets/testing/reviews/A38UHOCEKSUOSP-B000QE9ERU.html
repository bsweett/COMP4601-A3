<meta name="summary" content="This is not revenge - it's punishment"></head><body><p>I am one of those who has never read the comics, but I do enjoy the comic book movies.  The Punisher is not as flawless as Spiderman, Batman Begins and the XMen films, but it does hold up much more than Fantastic Four, Daredevil and Hulk.  The film could have been darker to fully capture the essence of punishment, but this is still a fun and emotion-filled ride.<br /><br />The most shocking thing about the Punisher is the way that Frank Castle's family is murdered.  It's not just his wife and son, but everyone from both sides of the family, in broad daylight, at a reunion near the beach of beautiful Puerto Rico.  Something about that scene was so dark, because it was filmed in such broad light.  As an undercover officer, Castle got a young man murdered, and that young man was the son of Howard Saint, a big name you apparently don't mess with in Tampa.  It was the wife however - Mrs. Saint - that ordered the execution of Castle and his family.  Revenge had been served.  However, it was punishment that Castle had yet to release.<br /><br />I thought the characters in this film were wonderful.  John Travolta does a great job as the villain Howard Saint.  He does nothing more than order his henchmen around to do the dirty work, but his acting and emotions involved with the part are nearly flawless.  His other son, acts like a sort of henchman for his father.  Probably not even in his 20's, this young man is still tall and built, and carries the look of intimidation.  Probably nothing more than just a kid inside, he still comes off as a cool henchman.  Then there is the Russian.  He is called to deal with Castle in one scene, and its both a great fight of action and amusement.  A famous opera tune (I forget the name of) is playing in Castle's neighbor's room during the fight, adding a little humor to the mix.  But the Russian's extreme size dwarfs Castle, and keeps the action scene hard.<br /><br />Though it could have been darker, there is a bit of strong violence throughout the film, along with some hard hitting fights and blood.  It doesn't go as far as gore, but you do get to see several scenes of knives being shoved into bodies, and perhaps one of the most outrageous in the film, a torture scene of piercings being ripped off of one's face (though the camera does pull away).  Castle finally unleashes his revenge, ahem, punishment, in the end, though I thought it could been done with a much bigger bang.  It is nice though, to see how his intelligence allows Saint to do most of the damage to himself.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid movie.  True fans will surely find something missing or different than what the comic book verison may contain.  My philosophy is if you haven't started reading them, don't, that way you can enjoy the movie for what it is.  And seriously, this entertains very well.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></body></html>

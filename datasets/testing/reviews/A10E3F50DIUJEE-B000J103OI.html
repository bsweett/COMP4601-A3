<meta name="summary" content="Goofy movie without much substance"></head><body><p>After several attempts to watch this on cable, I have finally seen it all.  With that being said, you are probably better off attempting to watch it on one of its numerous cable/movie channel runs.<br /><br />The story is this: Andy (played by Anne Hathaway) comes to NY in hopes of making it big as a serious investigative journalist, but winds up taking a job that she is not suited for, and does not want, working for Miranda Priestly (played splendidly by Meryl Streep).  As Andy comes to realize more and more everyday just how much she does not belong and hates her job, she eventually tries to make the best of it by the old "grin and bear it" method.  She does end up doing better, but at the cost of her social life.  And the story winds down the predictable path about the choices that Andy must make in order to be truly happy.<br /><br />Not the most unique, but I guess it works, although I found the ending trite and borderline insulting to young professional women.<br /><br />Regardless of that, the film is a wonderful vehicle for the talents of Meryl Streep (of course) and Emily Blunt.  Any one interested in fashion will also be appeased, as it is a fashionista's dream.<br /><br />It is good for a cute goofy movie, but nothing too funny or endearing to make it worth owning.</p></body></html>

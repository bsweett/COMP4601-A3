In his freetime he dreams of serial killing, even keeping an album on the deeds of other men. He also has a knife and imagines himself killing over and over again, and this little deed attracts the attnetion of Eli. Eli first approaches Oscar on a playground outside of his apartment as he works on a Rubic Cube, and the two quickly strike up conversation. for all intents and purposes, it is an innocent affair between two 12 year olds. The only problem is that Eli has a friend she lives with and that friend hangs people from trees and drains them of blood. Worse still, Eli drinks blood to survive and has a need to feed - even if that means picking off people in the most unlikely of positions.<br /><br />Before I begin, I have to note that this is not the book Let Me In. If you watch closely you can see a lot of the pieces here, but you lose a lot as well. You lose Oscar's problems, Eli's ways, and you lose her "roommates" deal. you also lose eli's past, something that is hinted to, and a lot of other things. Still, that doesn't mean that much. Personally, i like the two of them and I keep them as different things in my mind. I do not like to mix the two, either, because the picture of eli in them movie is one I love. I like the way the two kids get along ore than anything, and I like the way things go. True, I would have liked the things that Eli can do with her hands and feet, but I am willing to give that up for the greater good of the movie. Besides, putting that stuff in would have certainly made this movie something that a lot of people would have protested.<br /><br />When you wathc this, everything from the acting to the way things go are beautiful. You have no idea how old Eli is here, but you get ideas of some things aobut here. She has a thing for puzzles, and one of the things she has is valuable enough to "buy a nuclear power plant" if sold. You also see the pain that Eli feels and the way that she seems to want to be loved. I have a thing with Oscar, not the actor but the kid in the movie, and I really am not a fan. I know hes a 12 year old, but he does things that are cruel. The thing with not inviting Eli in is hard to watch because shesimply wants someone to care, and other things hapen as well. Still, it is tender in a lot of places and, honestly, it touches me and creeps me out as well.<br /><br />This movie has some stuff in it that is kiddy. you might keep that in mind when wathcing it. You might also keep in mind that it is not the book so, for those who didn't like the reading, you have something different.As I said before, this is NOT the bok and sometimes reading it may even hurt what you have seen. You get background and some stuff you may want to know, but knowing them hurts the relationship. honestly, stick with the 5 star movie unless you simply have to have it all. this is a great feature and you can love it forever.</p></body></html>

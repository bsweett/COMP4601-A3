John McLoughlin, and Pena stars as officer Will Jimeno.  These two men, along with a crew of other officers, entered into the stricken World Trade Center shortly after the brutal terrorist attacks.  Their job was to go up inside the tower and assist with rescue efforts.  However, shortly after entering the buildings, the collapse began.  The officers immediately dove for an elevator shaft; supposedly one of the strongest places in the building.  Despite their quick thinking, McLoughlin, Jimeno, and the rest of the officers are buried under tons of concrete and debris.  McLoughlin and Jimeno are the only survivors.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jimeno's wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is 5 months' pregnant with a new baby daughter, and McLoughlin's wife Donna (Maria Bello) is busy making plans for her son J.J.'s birthday party.  Both see the terrorist attacks on television and immediately fear for their husbands' safety.  The two families begin a consant vigil while waiting to hear any news about the well-being of their husbands.<br /><br />While buried in the rubble, Jimeno and McLoughlin try to do anything they can to stay awake and keep each other alive.  Fearing internal injuries, neither man wants to fall asleep.  They keep each other awake by talking about their families and their lives as police officers.  A deep bond forms between the two, and neither wants to be rescued without the other.<br /><br />Efforts to find survivors have begun, spearheaded by members of the United States Marines, along with the New York City Fire and Police Department.  One member of the Marine unit is Sgt. Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon).  A former member of the Marines, Karnes has left his regular accounting job to come to New York to assist with rescue efforts.  He, along with another rescuer, hears Jimeno banging on a pipe.  Soon, Karnes has located the two fallen officers, and reinforcements are called in to get them out.  The two men are soon pulled to safety and taken to a local hospital.<br /><br />Only twenty survivors were pulled from the wreckage of the World Trade Center.  McLoughlin and Jimeno endured more than most people possibly could, and they survived to tell about it.  Both endured several surgeries on their road to recovery, but something more came out of this ordeal; a life-long bond and friendship between two officers who were merely doing their jobs.<br /><br />This is a truly moving and magnificent film.  Nicholas Cage gives one of the finest performances of his career as Sgt. McLoughlin, while Michael Pena is excellent as officer Jimeno.  Oliver Stone's directing is first-rate, and he tells the story of 9-11 in a factual, yet sensitive and tasteful manner.<br /><br />I give this tremendous film my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how two heroic police officers risked their own lives to save the lives of strangers and ended up surviving their own personal hardships.  If you have a dry eye after watching this movie, then something's wrong.</p></body></html>

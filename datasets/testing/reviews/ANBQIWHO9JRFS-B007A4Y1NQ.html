<meta name="summary" content="Charlie Kaufman is a Genius, Pt. 1"></head><body><p>Unlike probably most "Being John Malkovich" fans, I actually saw the later Kaufman-Jonze collaboration "Adaptation" first.  I thought, and think, that that movie is brilliant, but I was a little disappointed in "Being John Malkovich" the first time I saw it.  It was very good, yes, but I was hoping for a bit more, since most reviewers seem to think it as good or better than that later film.  Well, yesterday I got through watching "Being John Malkovich" for the third time, about 2 years after I first saw it, and it's grown on me quite a bit.  I still don't think it's quite as good as "Adaptation", but it's pretty close.<br /><br />"Being John Malkovich" is one of those movies that seems to take place in the real world, except that there are a bunch of odd details that aren't right.  Ex: Puppeteering is a major artform; everyone in the world is a total oddball; there's a building with a 7 1/2 floor which contains a portal into John  Malkovich's brain.  This movie is so massively yet still so unobtrusively weird that I'm sure it requires a very specific taste to fully get into it.  You definitely need a taste for the odd.<br /><br />The story centers around Craig Schwartz, (John Cusack) a failed street-puppeteer who lives in depression with his strange but good-natured wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) and their 100 or so pets.  Lotte suggests that Craig get a job, a real job, and he does so, becoming a filing clerk at a small business on the 7 1/2 floor of a large office building. (The ceiling is all of 4 1/2 feet high, and they have to emergency-stop the elevator to get to the floor.)  Craig is immediately smitten with fellow 7 1/2 floor-dweller Maxine (Catherine Keener).  Maxine is a cruel and cold-hearted individual, but Craig can't help himself and continues to pursue her in spite of her utter contempt for him.  His efforts appear to be going nowhere until one day when he finds a small door hidden behind a filing cabinet.  He crawls in it to discover that this is a portal into John Malkovich's brain, where you watch what Malkovich sees for 15 minutes, after which you are dumped in a ditch by the road  And then things really get weird, as Craig uses this portal as a way to connect with Maxine, but Lotte and others get drawn in and Malkovich finds out what's going on and we learn of the real purpose of the portal and on and on.  I don't want to go on, cause the inexplicable, labyrinthine plot is much of the appeal of the film.  (Though it isn't just crazy for crazy's sake, and actually comes together well.)  Beyond this, Kaufman has tons of clever, intelligent dialogue to support the wacky plot.<br /><br />This movie is damn hard to review, cause it's so strange, and yet much of the appeal and humor is character-driven.  The unbelievable, oddball characters are all interesting, usually funny and often endearing.  Cusack is our main character and sort of the straight man of the film.  Still, he's not quite normal-- He does, after all, want to be a famous puppeteer.  He's a typical "tortured artist" with a scruffy beard and a ponytail, but you can't help but like him.  He's just so hapless, and John Cusack always does the average man thing well.  Orson Bean is great as Dr. Lester, Craig's boss and a 125 year old lech.  (As Craig says, "It's pretty funny once you get past how disgusting it is.)  Catherine Keener is fantastic as Maxine, one of the most black-hearted  characters I've ever seen.  Yeah, she doesn't physically hurt anyway, but her relentless verbal abuse is unbelievable, as she responds to anything Craig says to her with a vicious, personal barb.  Finally, John Malkovich is wonderful as himself (sort of), and he hits a great range of notes and isn't afraid to make himself look bad.  (No one with half a brain would think this really has anything to do with who Malkovich really is, but lotsa people don't have half a brain...)<br /><br />Though "Being John Malkovich" is a comedy, it's a rather thoughtful and ultimately very sad one.  It touches on themes of isolation, the desire to be someone else and the ultimate absurdity and uncontrollability of human life.  This absurdity is encapsulated in the central conflict, in Craig's unrequited love for Maxine; there's no reason why he should love her, she is, as Craig himself says, evil, but he can't help himself;  Man is capable of reason, but emotion rules us and emotion only sporadically makes sense. (And applying reason to emotion never helps, not in my experience, anyway.)<br /><br />Though I can't help but see Kaufman as the primary author of the film, Jonze deserves a ton of credit for bringing the vision to fruition.  Making a film this wacky seem real must be damn near impossible, but Jonze pulls it off with aplomb and spectacular technical proficiency.  The film moves from near conventional scenes to first-person perspective, to dream sequences and flat out surrealism.  Yet, for all the technique displayed in the film, it rarely seems extraneous.  Jonze doesn't seem to be showing off, the flash is all just necessary to navigate the inexplicable plot.  The score is also fantastic, truly beautiful and often-moving, and it allows for a lot of the emotional impact in the film, particularly in the brilliantly conceived and heartbreaking final scene.<br /><br />Man, this review is no good, but you can't do justice to a movie this good and this odd in a review.  You'll just have to watch it.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

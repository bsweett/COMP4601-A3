<meta name="summary" content="Irish pigs and mud and huts"></head><body><p>Note to my "fans": this is my edited previously published review. It's just that it's so good I know you deserve to see it here:<br /><br />Lord, how I hate these THIS-IS-THE-GOL-DARNED-ABSOLUTE-TRUE-STORY type deals.<br /><br />This dreadful clunker directed by Antoine Fuqua, a Chicago native like me, prods itself along horribly. Beginning with narration by Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot) telling us all about Rome's manifest destiny delusion, and how it wanted all of Britain to go along, we are treated to a dubious map of Europe, showing us Rome and the region of "Sarmatia". This is vital, because most of Arthur's "knights" are supposedly "Sarmatian" conscripts here. Of course there was at the time no such place, and few historians know anything about Sarmatians.<br /><br />After the introductory Roman army scenes, we go to a little community of huts somewhere in England. A boy named "Arturius" (Arthur, misnamed because the correct Latin is "Arcturus") is about to be conscripted. They take him, after he says his goodbyes to his mother and foster father, a priest named Pelagius (based on the real heretic Father Pelagius of Scotland, he of the Arian heresy). Though he's a child, Arthur is already strong, handsome and ready to go. Asking the Roman officer how long he will be gone, he is told, "Fifteen years." DUH!<br /><br />It is sometime around 452 A.D. We don't really know, because the date is flashed on the screen at a weird time. All grown up, with his "Sarmatian knights" hard alongside, Arthur (Clive Owen) and the knights are awaiting freedom from Roman army conscription. The goofy Bishop Germanius (deliciously over-acted by Ivano Marescotti, based on the real Bishop Septimus) arrives, in full Roman battle gear, ready to deliver the conscripts' freedom papers. The knights, like the bishop, are a sketch.<br /><br />The stalwart round table fellows consist of Lancelot ( Ioan Gruffudd), Tristan (Mads Mikkelson), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone) and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson). For all the personality these fellows should have, the only interesting one is Tristan, only because he is wearing Mongolian armor and wields a samurai/scimitar like a... well, like a samurai.<br /><br />The king had a Japanese samurai on the Round Table?<br /><br />The knights are cornered by the bishop for one last assignment, handed down directly by the pope: go beyond Hadrian's Wall and fetch a wayward Roman family. We do not know who the Romans are or why they're up there in the North...but this Roman's handsome son is a "personal favorite" of the pope's. They have to get those Romans outta there before the evil, lip-smacking Saxons run over them and eat them alive.<br /><br />Bitching and grumbling, the knights obediently prepare for what they are sure will be their slaughter. They obey only because Arthur asks them. So the "quest" begins. Arthur and his semi-retarded knights are being followed by the creepy "Wodes", a fictional people who serve no purpose. Actually, the Wodes are a vehicle for Merlin: he is their leader. The Wodes have waged war for decades, and they seem to be a mish-mash of Picts and Celts, so no wonder.<br /><br />At the Roman's villa, Arthur rescues a Wode woman who turns out to be Guenevere. Aside from her vampiric gyrations, we are treated to some mysterious language that is supposed to be Old English. Everyone speaks with Eurotrash accents, but the "Wodes" speak a gobbledy-gook Saxon language requiring subtitles! At least the bishop sounds Italian, but then, Marescotti is Italian.<br /><br />Merlin appears, well past the halfway mark in this 140-minute borefest. This guy is a must-see: wild-eyed, scruffy-looking, like a cross between a Neanderthal homeless guy and refugee from "Clan of the Cave Bear". He begs Arthur to come back (later, of course) to lead the Wodes into a new British era. Nothing comes of any of this, and Merlin, who gets a few seconds' screen time altogether, plays no further part in the story.<br /><br />Another character speaks insanely about the coming of Excalibur to Britain. It's a tragic loss: we never are told what the hell "Excalibur" is! Arthur ends up with NADA. The goose egg, my friends, not even a decent Roman villa for his hassles. Much less does he wind up king of anything--except B-movie flops, perhaps.<br /><br />The film is ultimately hilarious, and not just because it has a few clever, snappy bits. The battle scenes are a joke, the story arc is a muddied mess, the acting is dreadful and the lines are silly. Somehow, it's all so bad that it really does seem "the true story".<br /><br />Trouble is, this director obviously flunked every class he ever took in his life. Including film.</p></body></html>

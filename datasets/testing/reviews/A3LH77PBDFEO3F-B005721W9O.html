<meta name="summary" content="Actually a pretty good lesson"></head><body><p>I have also watched this fun movie several times (all without my sweetheart who hates the idea of sci-fi) and I liked it because it teaches one of my favorite theories. It is impossible to pretend to be something for very long without in some way becoming that thing. The key is what do you pretend to be? Hopefully it is something more noble than what you may have been. I don't mean that it is good to be hypocritical, just that by stiving to be the man you would like to be is better than settling for the man you are. Maybe that is way too deep for this fun spoof of the Star Trecified shows.<br /><br />So here's the deal, this is a funny if a bit silly spoof that just might give you something to think about if you are in the mood.</p></body></html>

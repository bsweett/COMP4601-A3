<meta name="summary" content="Dogma DVD"></head><body><p>Dogma is probably one of if not Kev's worst films. How a Catholic can Make this movie is beyond me. As a Catholic myself I wouldn't cross the line for the sake of "Art" if that's what people think art is that's their problem.<br />Kevin is a very talented Guy as are the cast it's sad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spike Lee in top form!  Inside Man delivers the goods with a awesome cast. Clive Owen rules!"></head><body><p>After the disaster in 2004 that was "She Hate Me", Spike Lee is back in top form here with "Inside Man", a great thriller starring Denzel Washington (Training Day, Fallen) as Detective Keith Frazier who with Detective Bill Mitchell played by the always superb Chiwetel Ejiofor (Serenity, Four Brothers) go to a bank where Dalton Russell played by Clive Owen (Sin City, Croupier) is talking hostage. Why is he doing it? What does he want? Well, Denzel doesnt think it's a bank robbery. There's someone off about this particular robbery in which the money isnt even taking. During the film we see Denzel and Chiwetel talking to hostages that were in the building because Clivey Boy had every single hostage strip and put on painters suits and masks which the robbers were wearing as well so it would confuse the police. Christopher Plummer (Sound of Music, The New World) plays Arthur Case the bank owner who goes to Madeline White played by Jodie Foster (Silence of the Lambs, Flightplan) who still beautiful at her age. There is something within the bank that holds value to Plummer which if it gets out could probably ruin Plummer. Which is basically why Owen is in the bank in the first place. I dont wanna give away any more details just go see this great movie for yourselves. Denzel is back in top form. He hasnt made a movie since The Manchurian Candidate and he gives a blazing performance as usual. Clive Owen! Come on! This guy is the word "awesome". Hes a force to be reckoned here. He's brilliant. What was with the music Spike at the beginning and end? That song was kinda weird. Also starring the fantastic Willem Dafoe (Shadow of the Vampire, Boondock Saints), Kim Director (Blair Witch 2, Summer of Sam), Daryl "Chill" Mitchell (10 Things I Hate About You), Ken Leung (Keeping the Faith, Rush Hour) and Peter Frechette (Profiler, Grease 2). One of the best movies so far to come out this year, well that's what I think</p></body></html>

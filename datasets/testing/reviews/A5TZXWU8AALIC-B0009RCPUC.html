Told mostly through the eyes of his secretary and other subordinates, you watch as Hitler descends further into illness and madness while his army and country are crushed by the advancing Russian and Allied forces overhead.<br /><br />I believe this film is definitely up there with PATTON and SCHINDLER'S LIST as far as great World War II films go.  It has the same authentic feel as a documentary, and the most professional look of a great dramatic film.<br /><br />This film puts you at the center of the spider's web that caused World War II, and it's even more remarkable since it's a German film.</p></body></html>

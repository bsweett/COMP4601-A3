<meta name="summary" content="Incredibly entertaining"></head><body><p>Kung Fu (or Kung Fu Hustle as I understand the title is open to debate) is a terrifically fun movie to watch. The comedy is not quite so prevalent as in Shaolin Soccer and there is a darker side to this movie with more violence, but it is so thoroughly engaging and entertaining that I could watch it over and over and over.<br />Stephen Chow brings the goods; the insane kung fu, the Looney Tunes moments, the hilarious characters, and the warm back story of Chow's character and his childhood introduction to a deaf mute girl, and wraps it up in this non-stop action packed darkly comedic delight.<br />How movies like this go unnoticed while tripe like Rush Hour gets made ad nauseum is a mystery to me, but if you enjoy this genre, you will love this movie. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Action and Acting, but fake Iguanas."></head><body><p>I liked this movie alot, and would have given it five stars, but for the inacurate portrayal of Marine Iguanas on the Galapagos Islands.  Read the other reviews for information on the acting and action, I am writing to stand up for the lowly Iguana.<p>Just about every rocky shoreline in the Galapagos Islands is home to the marine iguana, the only sea-going lizard in the world. The marine iguana is an extraordinary animal which lives on land but grazes on a variety of seaweed, either on exposed rocks or by diving into the cold seawater. This habit, totally unique in iguanas, provides them with an abundant food source but can make them vulnerable to predation by sharks and other large fish. <p>In the movie, there are scenes reminiscent of Darwin's "Voyage of the Beagle", many of the characters are seen collecting what are supposed to be marine iguanas.  However, are these actual Galapagos marine iguanas?  No.  These are actually the common Green Iguanas of South America.  They are not even using costumes or makeup, just their natural green skin.  It is like they are acting on the stage.  Do these iguanas get credit at the end of the movie?  No!  Like Kermit the frog said, Its not easy being green.  Real marine iguanas are ugly dark colored brutes you would never want to meet in a dark alley, but common green iguanas are our friends.  <p>This was a great movie, it just doesn't give proper credit to the iguanas.</p></body></html>

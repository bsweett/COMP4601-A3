<meta name="summary" content="Dark, very dark for a Star Trek Movie"></head><body><p>I'm not a fan of the dark movies, it may create an evil effect, but also makes it hard for the viewer to enjoy all that there is to be seen.  This does live up to the Franchise history.  Good battle scenes, conflict between good and evil, and true victory to the one that out thinks or out strategizes the other.  I'm glad to see that they continue to bring the "technology" further into the future and that they allow the characters to grow and receive some "promotions" as side stories in it all.  All in all, I have to say that I wasn't really disappointed with this movie and have added it to my collection.  If you are a Star Trek fan, you should buy it.  If you like Sci-Fi movies, you should at least watch it.</p></body></html>

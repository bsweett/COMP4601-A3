And naturally, who better than hack Paul W.S. Anderson to write and direct this?  For starters, as a few previous reviewers already mentioned, there are so many non-sensical plot devices (if the Predators come to Earth every 100 years, then what were Arnie and Danny Glover fighting in the first two Predator movies) that the film tries to make little sense at all.  One thing that particularly bothered me here, is that right after the Alien facehuggers impregnated the hosts, they immediately birthed an Alien.  Am I wrong, or didn't it take at least a few hours for an Alien to gestate inside it's host before it was born?  If this wasn't the case, then John Hurt would have been dead right after the facehugger came off him, and would have never made it to dinner.  Not to mention Sigourney Weaver would have never lived long enough to kill herself in Alien 3, and would have been dead as soon as she crash landed on Fury 161.  The dialogue is atrocious, and the cast, besides Trainspotting's Ewen Bremner and good 'ol Lance Henriksen, is bad as well.  The only good points of AVP are some imaginitive production designs, and the Predators look as cool as ever, but that's it.  To sustain a PG-13 rating, which no film in either series ever got, there was a good bit of gore cut out of the film which many are hoping will be fully restored for the upcoming Unrated version of the film to be released on DVD, but added gore scenes aren't going to save this.  Let's all take the time to thank Paul W.S. Anderson (nice job on what an above reviewer interpreted the W.S. to stand for) for delivering another mainstream aimed schlock fest, and naturally, there's a shameless door being left open for a sequel (or two, or three).</p></body></html>

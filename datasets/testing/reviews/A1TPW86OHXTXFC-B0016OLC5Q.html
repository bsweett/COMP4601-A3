<meta name="summary" content="I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD"></head><body><p>"Wise Men in Their Bad Hours":<br />Death's a fierce meadowlark: but to die having made<br />Something more equal to centuries<br />Than muscle and bone, is mostly to shed weakness.<br />The mountains are dead stone, the people<br />Admire or hate their stature, their insolent quietness,<br />The mountains are not softened or troubled<br />And a few dead men's thoughts have the same temper<br />"I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD. GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL!" Found written in Alexander Supertramp's Notebook.<br /><br />Sean Penn has directed a magnificent film. Every image tells a story- the sea, the cities, the wheat fields, the rivers, the glorious mountains, the trains, and the young man himself who experiences these vistas. Christoper or Alexander Supertramp as he calls himself is seemingly running toward something. Sure he is running from his abusive family, but it seems to me he is searching for the purity of life, and he found it. Peter Travers of 'Rolling Stone' says "If, like Penn, you mourn Chris's tragedy and his judgment errors but also exult in his journey and its spirit of moral inquiry, then this beautiful, wrenching film will take a piece out of you. "  And, this film will remain with me for a long long time.<br /><br />The people that Supertramp meets along the way, are part of him and his story. They all bring a little piece of knowledge and love into his life. And every person he meets falls in love with him. He leaves them while he can.  This is a physical film, lots of hard work and labor just to survive.  An odyssey to a deliverance.  Emile Hirsch, as Christopher McCandless is extraordinary. A young man who portrays a physical and emotional loneliness.  Hal Holbrook as a retired military man gives the performance of his life- the tears he sheds as Christopher walks away are the tears we all shed.<br /><br />Christopher loved literature and he was influenced by Leo Tolstoy, Henry David Thoreau, and Jack London.  Their philosophies are written throughout his notebook. He is always reading throughout this film, and at one point he cannot carry the books any longer and buries them encased in plastic beneath a highway overpass.<br /><br />Eddie Vedder's voice is portrayed in song throughout the movie and it seems at times as Peter Travers states" Eddie Vedder's remarkable songs, notably a cover of "Hard Sun," sound like the voice of Chris' unconscious."  Chris and a young hippie woman he meets sing 'Angel of Montgomery' which may be one of the most poignant memories and sounds of the film.<br /><br />'Make me an angel<br />Just give me one thing<br />That I can hold on to<br />To believe in this livin<br />Is just a hard way to go'<br /><br />Christopher finds his way to Alaska and after four months he slowly dies of starvation. We are with him, in his bus and we experience the glories that he feels and the visions he sees. Through our tears we celebrate with him.<br /><br />"Which is not to say that there is anything easy or naive in what Mr. Penn has done. "Into the Wild" is, on the contrary, alive to the mysteries and difficulties of experience in a way that very few recent American movies have been. There are some awkward moments and infelicitous touches -- a few too many Eddie Vedder songs on the soundtrack, for -- but the film's imperfection, like its grandeur, arises from a passionate, generous impulse that is as hard to resist as the call of the open road."

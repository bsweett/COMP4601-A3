There is a very emotional story between a father and his family and the quest to bring his son home after the boy is kidnapped by the RUF rebels and turned into a killer. This backstory behind the history brings a dose of realism to the characters that we can sink an attachment into. We really care about the story and what happens to the people in it; something that is often missing from many action packed films. Leo DiCaprio does a masterful job with the dialect and acting, along with Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly. This is a splendid screenplay that's well balanced, entertaining and at the same time complex in its description of just one of the many long struggles in Africa. Exceptional movie, brilliant acting! If I'd been a judge it would've won several Oscars.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

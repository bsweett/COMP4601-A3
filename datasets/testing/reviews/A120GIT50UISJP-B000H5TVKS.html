<meta name="summary" content="An inevitable let down from the brilliant original"></head><body><p>Saw II started life with a number of disadvantages. The originality of Saw pretty much guarantees that Saw II will be a letdown, if only because the most interesting twists have already been run. We know why Jigsaw does what he does. Even the twist ending isn't much of a twist, given the first one. Working out the connections between the players in his game is easier and less surprising because we're expecting connections.<br /><br />The connections are many, and new ones abound. Almost all of the players (with the exception of the detective father of one of the hostages) have been placed in a sealed house. They must solve a series of puzzles to survive, each one highlighting the sins of one or another of the victims. A room filled with dirty syringes faces an addict who spends her days shooting up with similar paraphenalia. The hot-head control freak must learn to resist the obvious red herrings.<br /><br />As hard as it would be to follow Saw, the fault lies with the filmmakers, too (their first mistake being trying to make a sequel, one that the director of the first movie, James Wan, didn't make). The puzzles are more interesting than the characters, and solving them is more the focus than the horrors they reveal. The first Saw forced us closer and closer to the characters, each secret revealed making our own sins more and more apparent. We were voyeurs looking in the mirror, to paraphrase Jigsaw. But here we are distanced from the victims; they're easy to dislike and dismiss--which would put us directly in Jigsaw's sights, but we don't really care because we really don't feel that they are us.<br /><br />It was a mistake, too, to give Jigsaw so much camera time. The more we see, the less mysterious and menacing he becomes. In the original, Jigsaw was a god-like enigma; in Saw II, he comes off as more sadistic and petty than profound and powerful.</p></body></html>

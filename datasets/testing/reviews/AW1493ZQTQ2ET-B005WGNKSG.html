It's basically a murder mystery, and there are plenty of twists and turns, as well as a strong sense of suspense which builds as the story unfolds.  Beware that there are some rather dark and disturbing scenes and themes which illustrate the lows to which humans can dip, so you have to brace yourself for that, but this is somewhat balanced by the movie portraying human decency and goodness, plus justice often prevails in the end.  The net result is that, although this certainly isn't a feel-good movie, it's not a horror flick either.<br /><br />Overall, all the elements of the movie are of high quality and they fit together well, so I found it easy to remain engaged for the required 2+ hours.  For me, a big part of the appeal of the movie is that it's set in Sweden (a country I've long wanted to visit), so much of the scenery is beautiful.  The Swedish setting is also important because, if there are attributes of the characters or plot which you would normally find hard to believe, the fact that you're dealing with another culture helps you suspend any disbelief and just go with the flow.  To fully benefit from this aspect, be sure to listen to the movie in Swedish and read the English subtitles, rather than using the corny English voice overdubbing.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this movie to people interested in this genre, especially people who can appreciate its foreign aspect.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Helping Men Get Hitched"></head><body><p>Will Smith stars in this movie as Alex Hitchens, a suave, smooth- talking fellow who knows his business and performs it well. The thing that makes the situation a little different is that Alex isn't in a traditional business. No, "Hitch" (as people call him) is in the business of love. He helps shy, awkward men find dates by coaching them on the right things to say and the right gestures to make. He is convinced that a man can get any woman if he follows the rules.<br /><br />Smith is the star of this movie, and he fits the part very well. It doesn't hurt that he has a fine supporting cast to back him up, including the likes of Kevin James, Eva Mendes, and Amber Valletta. I felt they all played their respective roles quite nicely, although I did find Eva Mendes character a little annoying after a while. On the other hand, Mendes is the one person who provides some suspense. She is a gossip columnist and the love interest of Will Smith. She isn't completely stable and she has erected an emotional fence when it comes to men. You don't really know what she is going to do from one scene to the next, and this makes her character a little more entertaining.<br /><br />What I like best about Hitch is that it gets you thinking about certain issues about dating, attraction, and ethics. Smith's character is convinced that a man can get the woman of his dreams, even if he isn't very good looking in comparison. There is some truth to this. I don't think any man can get any woman, but it is generally easier for a man with average or below average looks to get a girl who looks better than the other way around. Also, as Smith's character points out near the end, he only provides a catalyst for his clients to get the woman they want. What he is doing is ethical because it is the client himself that is really doing the work. If a relationship isn't meant to be, then no amount of coaching will help.<br /><br />One thing that I didn't like about this movie occurred near the beginning when Smith talked directly to the camera. Unless a film is a documentary, I don't think it's a good idea to have the actors and actresses talk to the camera, like they know a film is being made. Besides that, I think the pacing could have been picked up a little bit in places, too. But overall, "Hitch" still ranks as a good, entertaining motion picture. The performances and the messages it sends about dating make it worth a look.</p></body></html>

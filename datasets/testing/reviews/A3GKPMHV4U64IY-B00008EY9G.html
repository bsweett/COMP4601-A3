<meta name="summary" content="Three Versions on One Disk"></head><body><p>I have heard a lot about this movie and its surprise ending.  But unlike The Sixth Sense, this move does not have a surprise ending.  All you have to do is pay attention and you will see al of the blatant clues telling you what will happen.<p>The viewer thinks they know what is going on as a collection of characters find themselves stuck at a small motel in a dreadful downpour.  Other scenes concern a mass-murderer who is getting a last-minute hearing.  The prisoner is en-route to the hearing.  But by paying attention we know that what the film wants us to think is far from true.<p>In Agatha Christie fashion, the people in the motel begin to be murdered.  Tensions and suspicions mount.  A new arrival at the hearing substantiates the earlier clues and derails the average viewer's ideas of what is going on.<p>Finally we get to the end where we resolve the relationship between the characters, the motel, the hearing and just what is going on.  No real surprise thanks to the blatant clues.  But even that hinges on believing a &quot;new treatment&quot; is possible without any explanation as to how it was done especially when it is the impossibility of said treatment that causes the dysfunction in the first place.  (sorry for being vague but there are those who will still be surprised and I don't want to spoil it).<p>The disk contains three versions: full screen, wide-screen, and extended wide-screen (extended by only a few minutes).  There are also some interesting deleted scenes (they are included in the novelization), but nothing mind-blowing.<p>A decent movie with great atmosphere (you'll never look at rain the same way) and some interesting characters.  But it could have been better if they didn't put in all of those clues.</p></body></html>

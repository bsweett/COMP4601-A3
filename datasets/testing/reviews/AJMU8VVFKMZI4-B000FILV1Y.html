<meta name="summary" content="An interesting story."></head><body><p>3.5 stars. First of all, I'm a sucker for romantic comedies and let's face it Matt McConaughey has great chemistry with wallpaper and he's just flat out easy on the eyes. (I mean even the tender moment with his mother when she's trying to explain why she did what she did, Matt didn't come across as a man talking to his mother...but a man sexually aware of another woman.  I don't think he's even aware of doing it.)<br />Anyway, this story about a thirty-five year old man's inability or lack of desire to move out of his parent's house is a good premise...and that's about all.  Yeah, there are a few interesting characters assembled here but the basic storyline runs out of gas.  Sarah Jessica Parker who certainly knows how to wear anything placed on her small curvy body has been making women jealous for the better part of a decade now.  No, she not overly gorgeous, but she just has that certain something that is a good match for McConaughey's Texas charm.<br />A short movie clocking in at a little more than an hour and a half, there are times when the movie feels long.  Sarah's eccentric roommate was different, but by the time we're watching her considering purchasing a high power rifle to kill a mockingbird, I'm wondering why we're spending so much time with this character.  Obvious, the character has a drinking problem...well at least she did at the beginning of the story but then the issue was never revisited and I just shrugged my shoulders.  Then there're these strange slap stick moments with the chipmunk, the dolphin, the lizard...and I'm wonder what all this has to do with anything.  Then one of the friend's expalnation is...you're out of sync with nature.  Huh?<br />Have the screenwriters taken a tad too many sips from the spiked punch?<br />Things got a little touch and go when Sarah sleeps with Tripp with his parents downstairs...and I'm thinking...does this make her a prostitute?  Then at the whole confrontation-I'm AMAZED no one brings this up.<br /> Then at a ballpark, one of Tripp's friends make an announcement that the black kid Matt calls his nephew isn't truely his nephew...???  Of course he's not.  Tripp doesn't have any brothers or sisters and the kid...well, is black.<br />You should have seen the shocked look on Paula's face.  What?  Not his nephew,what are you talking about?  I know as a society we're preaching the whole 'love is color blind' but c'mon.  Was she truely not supposed to notice this?<br />I could live without Terry Bradshaw's nude scenes...but hey, you gotta admire the man's guts.  But this move of shocking the audience to view the naked body of the average Joe was only impressive when NYPD Blue did it a decade ago with Dennis Franz.<br />Plus, how much further up the financial ladder of mature adults are you when you live with a ROOMMATE?  Isn't that move really for your twenties?  Clearly Paula is a mid-thirties to...okay so she's forty, but isn't this a tad hypocritical?<br />And then we have the campy ending with the great bright idea of kidnapping Tripp and locking Paula into a camera rigged room and watching the couple a la reality TV while the couple patch things up.  Way...way over the top.<br />Now, I realize I sound like I didn't enjoy the movie.  I did.  At best I can say it's cute...a descent rental...but it could have been great in the hands of a better group of screenwriters.</p></body></html>

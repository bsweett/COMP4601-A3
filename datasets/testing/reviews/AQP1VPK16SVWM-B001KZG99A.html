<meta name="summary" content=""So you are a man who has everything but nothing..don't waste your life"-Terrific looking movie with metal head's origin"></head><body><p>PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS MY OPINION DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN OR PURCHASED THE MOVIE--YOUR MILAGE MAY VARY. IF YOU WANT INFO ON PICTURE/SOUND AND EXTRAS SKIP TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH PARAGRAPHS.<br /><br />THIS REVIEW IS ON THE TWO DISC SET. THE ONE DISC SET PRIMARILY HAS THE FEATURE FILM<br />THANKS!<br /><br />"Titanium Composite Man" just doesn't have the same ring to it as "Iron Man". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is "The Merchant of Death" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.<br /><br />He uses the crude tools to build a suit of metal that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by coming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).<br /><br />The DVD looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. It's one of the top notch transfers  I've seen in recent years. Audio is extremely active and is well used to put you into metal head's world.<br /><br />The extras are stunning as well. We get a full documentary "I AM Iron Man" that details all aspects of production giving us a glimpse into everything from pre-CGI work, design elements to on-the-set wire work involving Robert Downey, Jr. Director Jon Favreau (who also plays Happy in the film)manages to seamlessly combine CGI with pratical physical effects such as puppets and the men in suits. His visual effects and physical effects team (from Stan Winston Studios)blend things so well that there were some shots that I could have sworn were physical effects but turned out to be CGI and vice versa. We also get deleted/extended scenes that are interesting but prove that Favreau made the right choice in cutting the bulk of them out. There are also stills galleries, screen test, a featurette "Invincible Iron Man" that gives us an idea about the development of the character with interviews featuring many of the Marvel bullpen who contributed to metal head's development, "Wired" which provides us background on the physical effects/visual effects of the film.<br /><br />Director Favreau manages to keep the fun comic book elements of the story and still attach a serious but entertaining element to the film resulting in one of the summer's best blockbusters. It may lack the darkness of "The Dark Knight" (that "Iron Man" is really Marvel's idea of "Batman" but a bit of irony thrown in for good measure except involving more advanced technology)but the alternating tone of the film makes it an enjoyable companion piece to the best of the "Spider-Man" films directed by Sam Raimi.<br /><br />The nice thing about "Iron Man" is that it doesn't betray its roots but celebrates them (although it does transport the action which originally occurred in Vietnam to Afgan terrorities and also moves some characters around such as Stane for a stronger, more cohesnive narrative but still remains true to the spirit of the comic book).<br /><br />Marvel's first in-house production "Iron Man" demonstrates that the comic book turned movie company can do as good a job (if not better)at during their own material in terrific films that don't betray their origins. Just a reminder--after the credits roll DON'T turn off your TV or DVD player. There's a sequence that actually sets up what is said to be the third "Iron Man" film (or second depending upon who you hear it from)and has a companion piece clip at the conclusion of "The Incredible Hulk".<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

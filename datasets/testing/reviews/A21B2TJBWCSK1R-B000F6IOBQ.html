<meta name="summary" content="Improves upon the first film!"></head><body><p>The first Underworld movie was a modest box office hit but enough, apparently, to spawn a sequel that continues the war that rages between vampires and werewolves. Director Len Wiseman pillaged visuals from both The Matrix and The Crow movies in the first one and this time around borrows a bit from The Lord of the Rings films in Evolution's prologue. However, from that point on, he strikes out on his own with decent results as he manages to improve on the characters and story he created in the first film.<br /><br />You have to give Wiseman credit - stylistically Evolution is consistent with its predecessor. It helps that he had a hand in crafting the story (and the film's mythos) and directed both movies while also advancing the mythology that grounds everything. He also changes settings, taking us away from the gothic European cities and into the countryside with ancient castles.<br /><br />As with the first film, Wiseman doesn't skimp on the R rated violence and gore, refusing to pander to the more lucrative PG-13 crowd (who would've just rented/bought the R version on DVD). He has improved upon his first film with Evolution which has a slightly more urgent tone because more is at stake. His direction is more confident and he wisely doesn't try to drag things out, keeping the running time well under two hours. Wiseman also manages to top most of the action set pieces in the first Underworld film without overreaching himself, including a climatic fight scene that is truly satisfying. Although, I have no idea how he'll top this one if the powers that be ask him to make it a trilogy... perhaps a prequel?<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Len Wiseman, production designer Patrick Tatopoulos, second unit director Brad Martin and editor Nicolas De Toth. This track is production anecdote-heavy as they talk about what it was like working on a given day and the challenges of shooting on a limited budget. This is actually quite an informative track with nary a lull anywhere.<br /><br />"Bloodlines: From Script to Screen" examines the origins of this movie. Wiseman had a lot of story content left over from the first film and its success allowed a sequel to further the mythos as he had envisioned it.<br /><br />"The Hybrid Theory" examines the film's visual effects which are 3-4 times more than the first film. The result is a seamless blend of CG and practical effects.<br /><br />"Making Monsters Roar" takes a look at the creature effects. The filmmakers consciously wanted to improve on the creature suits and make them more flexible so that they move more realistically and fluidly.<br /><br />"The War Rages On" examines the stunts performed on the movie. Much more ambitious ones were planned that were faster and more aggressive than what we saw in the first Underworld movie.<br /><br />"Building a Saga" takes a look at the production design. The scale of this film was much bigger with old castles that involved a lot of building of interior sets. Wiseman consciously wanted to move away from an urban setting to more of a period piece vibe.<br /><br />"Music and Mayhem" examines the sound design, the film's score and how it enhanced the drama of the movie, manipulating how the audience felt about a given scene.<br /><br />Finally, there is a music video for "Her Portrait in Black" by metal band Atreyu done in the style of the film with lots of clips from it. Basically, the lead singer comes from what has been called the Cookie Monster school of vocals.</p></body></html>

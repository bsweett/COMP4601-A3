<meta name="summary" content="Elizabeth: The Golden Age"></head><body><p>A holy war has been declared against England's Protestant Queen Elizabeth (Blanchett) by the Pope.  Leading the charge is Spain's King Philip II, who wants to replace her with Quenn Mary of Scotland (Morton), a Catholic who is imprisoned.  On the home front, Elizabeth is being pressured to marry by her advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Rush).  She rejects many possible husbands, but finds some interest in Sir Walter Raleigh (Owen).<br /><br />"The Golden Age" is an entertaining but flawed movie.  On the positive side, it is great to look at.  The costumes, set design, and cinematography are gorgeous.  The acting, while not as standout as in the first movie, is still impressive, especially by Cate Blanchett.  On the negative side of things, the story isn't that exciting.  Historical fact is also compromised for cinematic value, but not much is added.  The war with Spain comes and goes quickly, and without much excitement.  "The Golden Age" is an adequate sequel, but by no means surpasses the original.  It is worth checking out though.</p></body></html>

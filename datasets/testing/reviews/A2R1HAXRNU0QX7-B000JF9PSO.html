<meta name="summary" content="A vital reminder...and a well-made film"></head><body><p>The moment this movie started, I felt my heart start to pound in anticipation of being upset, angry, terrified, and generally put through an emotional wringer.  This is not a "pleasant" moving-going experience.  It's wrenching because for me it brought back many of my feelings from 9/11.  Helplessness, anger, sadness.  But it also gave me new respect for the passengers on United 93, and for many of the people in the air traffic control towers who could do little beyond watch helplessly.<br /><br />The movie is more or less in real time.  We aren't introduced to any characters in a predictable way.  No back stories...heck, no names are given for most of the main characters.  It's as though we are ono the plane or in the tower with the people who were there.  We can't do anything but watch and cringe.<br /><br />Some have said it makes us feel like we're there with the passengers.  I didn't feel that, because I knew I was safe.  But I did have this amazing feeling of wishing I could change things.  I knew that in a few minutes, all these people would be dead, but I was looking urgently for the hope that the story might turn out differently.<br /><br />The movie is well-acted, but it's more about the editing and cinematography.  It's fast moving, and often visually a little confusing.  After all, the director, Peter Greengrass, was trying to be as faithful as possible to the real events, but we don't know what all of them are...just snippets gleaned from phone conversations and minimal transmissions.  The rest was filled in...so one way to handle the gaps in our knowledge is to throw the camera right in the middle of the action, where we're so close that much of what we see are closeups of jostling torsos, and lots of yelling and noise.<br /><br />It's hard to review this film, because we're very close to it still.  But what it does do is remind the viewer again that we were attacked, and that we were attacked not by a rational enemy with a negotiable aim.  We were attacked by religous zealots who truly believe that our deaths are their salvation.  It's important to remember.  It's important to remember that sometimes when we engage the enemy, we don't have perfect clarity as to what they are doing, but we DO know that inaction won't result in a happy capitulation.  I'm not trying to politicize the movie, but that's the first effect it had on me.<br /><br />Best of all, the cast of this movie looks like REAL people.  No great beauties or handsome hunks.  The people who took action sweated with fear or wept with terror.  They weren't commandos on a mission, they were fathers, sons, wives and children who thought first of their loved ones and then of the lives they might save by risking their own.  And they nearly pulled off saving their own lives...but we are quite sure they saved hundreds of lives who would have been lost in our capital that day.<br /><br />The movie is R-rated, mostly for some cussing (not too much, though) but mostly, I would say, for the intensity of the film.  One hundred years from now, when things have changed a great deal in the world, viewers will probably wonder what the fuss was about.  But for a world not even 5 years removed from the event, UNITED 93 is vital viewing.</p></body></html>

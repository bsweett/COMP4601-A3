Contains some of the most artistic and imaginative uses of special effects since "Fight Club." Altogether, it's very vivid and intense.<br />*Characters are good and well-developed.  Good focus on their drama (without being too sappy).  By the end of the film, you can really feel for their losses.  It's quite emotional.<br />*Strong anti-drug message.  Even though everything seems cheery at first, it quickly becomes dark and frightening.  It's even more effective than any other drug movie I have seen (all of the ones I've seen have been upbeat for some wierd reason).  The characters, music, and imagery accentuates this central moral very well.<br />*Excellent music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*There are a few graphic scenes at the end (and a few bits of nudity throughout the middle).  I didn't think it was as bad as everybody else says, but it's still not reccomended for the squeamish.<br /><br />Next to "Children of Men" and "The Passion," this is one of the few movies that makes me want to cry.  It is a deep, dark, and powerful downward spiral into madness and despair.  As intense as it is, it truly makes me feel for the characters (and scares me away from ever doing drugs).  Above all, it sticks out in my head as one of the best, most stylish, and most memorable films made in the past ten years.  Everybody should watch this film at least once, for it is intense and somewhat thought-provoking.</p></body></html>

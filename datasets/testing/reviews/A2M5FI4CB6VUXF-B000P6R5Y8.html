You have AnnaSophia Robb staring (brilliantly I might add) in a flick about an adolescent with an overactive imagination... yet her imagination is depicted for all of 20 minutes in a 90 minute flick. The creatures are mindless cardboard cutouts, meant to represent real-life characters in their everyday world, but they wind up being boring parodies of themself.<br /><br />The movie had great potential. Lots of area for conflict, what with a controlling "down on his luck" deadbeat dad and all. But in the end, the film would have been better if it had gone unmade. Or perhaps benefitted from about another half hour actually IN Terabithia.</p></body></html>

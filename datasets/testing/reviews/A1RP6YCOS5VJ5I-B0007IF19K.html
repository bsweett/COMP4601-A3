What I found most interesting about this movie is the things he was doing when he was writing and performing his songs and where the inspiration behind some of his hits came from. Jamie Foxx and every other actor on this film did very well. This film is very touching and at some points very sad. Again, I applaud Foxx in his excellent portrayal he is Ray in this film. You feel his joys and also all of his pain. I can see how this film won an Academy Award. I was born and have lived in Georgia all my life and I'm proud that his song is our state song. Great job Jamie, excellent life Ray</p></body></html>

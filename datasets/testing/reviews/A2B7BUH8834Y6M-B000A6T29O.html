<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining and action-packed"></head><body><p>This film is a visual feast, especially the shots in the lush jungles of Cambodia. Considering the plot of the film has its roots in a video game, the film does admirably well... but it does take itself a little seriously.<p>The orphaned child of a wealthy, world-famous archeologist, Lara Croft lives the life of Batman... a stately mansion/castle w/ intensely loyal servants and a cavalcade of one-of-a-kind gizmos and James-Bond-esque weapons and gadgets, not to mention a garage full of Jaguars, Porsches and BMW's.<p>Mysterious dreams and/or voices in her head draw Lara to a forgotten relic in a storage space under the stairs which turns out to be the key to a device that controls time and space. Naturally, super villains seek to get the relic and learn how to use it, turning Lara Croft into a buxom Indiana Jones on a globe-trotting adventure with booby-traps, exotic locales and animated stone statues.<p>Much of the story is totally perposterous, so you make yourself escape, acknowledging that this is totally a fantasy... then you have actors and scenes and dialogue that treat the film as though it were a documentary... much of the film is way over-acted, forced and downright cheesy.<p>Despite silly cliche scenes, Angelina Jolie pulls off the character as a feminine, sexy, butt-kicking machine. Sadly, the filmmakers felt obliged to show her in a white cotton dress at the end of the film to underscore her feminine side. It was trite and almost insulting... but then again, so was a great percentage of this movie.<p>The amount of cheese will ensure you will not be calcium deficient, but the action is entertaining and enjoyable. <p>The DVD makes the movie that much more enjoyable by packing in a lot of features, including deleted scenes and behind the scenes footage of the special effects highlights.</p></body></html>

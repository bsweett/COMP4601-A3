The end, however, did not provide any closure at all, and for people who are "closure freaks" this is bound to be rather annoying.  This is much like the movie 2001: the ending means whatever it means to you.  If you like talking about movies, this one will give you several lattes worth of material.<br /><br />So, kudos for the stunning visuals, music score, Hugh Jackman's intensity and Rachel Weisz's adorability, and the mythology that ties the three threads of all this eye and ear candy together.  But, seeing it once I doubt I'll ever want to see it again.</p></body></html>

This isn't the first time he proved he can make more than just horror movies though. He also made a drama with Merryl Streep about 4 or 5 years back. Anyway it's called Red Eye because that's the name of the plane Rachel McAdams takes. Some trailers make the movie look supernatural. With Cillian Murphy eyes turning red like he's a demon or something that's taunting McAdams. No though this is just a thriller and he's just a normal guy. Well if you call a hitman a normal guy.<br /><br />  Anyway McAdams meets Murphy when the flight is delayed. She seems to like his company andc this could've became one of those romantic movies about a chance meeting. Since they have good chmestry. After getting on the plane she finds that she's seated next him as well. Soon after take off he reveils that he's going to have someone kill her dad if she doesn't do what he says. Since she has authority at an airline, she can move his targets room which would make him an easier to target.<br /><br />  Cillian Murphy (Batman Beging, 28 Days Later) and Rachel McAdams (The Notebook, Mean Girls, Wedding Crashers) give fine performances. He shows how evil and manipulative he is and she shows it's not gonna be as easy as he thought. She turns out to be both tough and smart. Unlike Murphy she'll go on to more romantic comedies and dramas and he'll probably be stuck type casted a villian. He is great as one though and probably even better here than he was in Batman Begins as the Scare Crow.<br /><br />  Brian Cox (X-2, 25th Hour) is a really good actor but here he's weak as her father. His performance is like something you'd get from a straight to video movie. I had to keep reminding myself that it was actually Brian Cox. Guess it's not really his fault. He wasn't really given a part worthy of him. Here he just answers the phone through most the movie and gets disconnected before she can warn him that he's in trouble. McAdams and Murphy give the best performances by far. They both are likeable. Murphy charms you and her in the beginning of the movie. Then he makes you afraid of him.  This isn't a bad movie for Craven either. Certainly better for his resume than Cursed.</p></body></html>

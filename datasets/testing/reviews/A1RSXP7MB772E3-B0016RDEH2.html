But only in reality is there the aweful possiblity that even this child can be slaughtered. The misery unfolds as the blood creeping from a little girls nose, that it's artistic, and you think how beautiful it is, serves as a dose of reality, cold reality.<br /><br />There is aweful violence in Pan's Labyrinth, and you should be aware of that. Seeing that beautiful girls face is not a sign of things to come, it serves as a counter to deaths disgusting face. And never before have I seen death walk hand in hand with fantasy. We have had bed time stories told to us when we were little. Little red riding hood was close to being killed, but she got away. There was always some danger to those tales. And other tales, such as the ginger bread man, hint at something more brutal, lying on that border of childhood and adulthood.<br /><br />This film follows the Gestalt principle that the sum of its parts is greater than its whole. You analyze the acting down to the maids, and it is all working. Ivanka Baquero is a child that expresses sorrow and a yearning for life. She feels the weight of a world at war, yet the child nature in her blooms before us as she follows her instincts to solve questions that may be of her own sanity.<br /><br />This movie draws you into it, and you want to discover the details, and you pray that they don't let you down. And Guillermo Del Toro does not. The phases of the moon, can play behind the gripping story, yet it has its own part of the story to tell as well. It is incredible to me, that after owning this movie for so long, that the beauty of the film and wonder has not been lost to me. Pan's Labyrinth is as cherished as those old stories my parents use to read to me before sleep.<br /><br />Del Toro, trust me, you'll hear more about him in the future, also gave some shockingly brutal kills that were down right frightening to watch. I felt mystefied. I was confused by the styles of the film. They were deliberately fairy tale like, yet, meshed with gritty war and horrendous violence. It's subtitles pulled you away from creatures that were dreamlike so unrealy fascinating that I must have had the captured look of an astonished child while in my seat. Nothing compares to this film that comes to mind. It's original and compelling: I'm so glad to be saying so about a film. It's been a depressing year for me. I'm nearly numb to the effects of cliche movie making.</p></body></html>

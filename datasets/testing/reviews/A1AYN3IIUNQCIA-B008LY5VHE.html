<meta name="summary" content="quiet arguably the best monster movie ever made"></head><body><p>forget the extremly bloated book, the crappy sequels, and the so called special addition. jaws is in fact one of my favorite movies, it has a raw quanity that makes you scared. when it came out in 1975 it scarred the crap out of people and the beachs became extremly quiet. this movie also takes not a make belive monster but a real life animal. the movie is about a resort town terrorrized by a great white shark. when the town offers a reward to kill it three poeple, a sheriff, a scientist, and a loney fisherman head out to take down the beast. the terror is big and the sequences are breathtaeking, this will remain one of the best creature movie made. oh and for those looking to remake the fil here are two things. one, it better be better then the original and two if not, don't make it at all to soil all over it.</p></body></html>

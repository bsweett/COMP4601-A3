<meta name="summary" content="FANTASTIC 4"></head><body><p>Marvel Comics' first family of superheros, the Fantastic Four.It begins when down-on-his-luck genius Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd, Horatio Hornblower) has to enlist the financial and intellectual help from former schoolmate and rival Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon, Nip/Tuck) in order to pursue outer-space research into human DNA. Also on the trip are Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis, The Shield); his former lover, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba, Dark Angel, Sin City), who's now Doom's employee and love interest; and her hotshot-pilot brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans, Cellular). Things don't go as planned, of course, and the quartet becomes blessed--or is it cursed? ,with superhuman powers, flexibility, brute strength, invisibility and projecting force fields, and bursting into a flame. Meanwhile, Doom himself is undergoing a transformation.</p></body></html>

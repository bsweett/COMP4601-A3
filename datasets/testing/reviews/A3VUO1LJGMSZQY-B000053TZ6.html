<meta name="summary" content="..."the emperor isn't wearing clothes!""></head><body><p>Have thoroughly enjoyed film and content of the 60th anniversary dvd set, but with the raves over the blu, decided to take the plunge and buy the 2 disc blu "book" from BB ($30). Sturdy packaging, and with same content as 60th dvd. Alas, I am going to upset folks, but perhaps some will be thankful to save some green. (Here goes:) On 50" 720p tv, I compared versions, scene by assorted scene. I believe the dvd has just as much picture clarity/detail as the blu. It is, however, a much brighter (harsher?) picture to view than the blu, which has a warmer, almost 'sepia' quality. In many scenes, the picture was 'grainier' (even light through windows) on the blu, while the dvd had a more polished or sterile look (that also adds to background clarity, like pictures on a wall). Purists likely prefer the 'grain', but is it even certain what Welles and Toland intended for their medium? Funny, but as I was 'wearing out' my tv's input button, I occasionally lost track of which version I was viewing, such is the quality of both. My recommendation (as a decidedly non-scholar): If you've never seen the film, and can afford the blu premium, than go for it! If you enjoy your "dated" dvd (that you've already paid for!), be content with that. My simple view is that I have heard nothing but "must own" RE: this blu release; my recent experience suggests otherwise. I also prefer the 60th packaging, with that great still and title graphic on cover. The 70th blu book does have a nice 48 page book of period pictures, film notes, storyboards, etc. (if retorts necessary, please be reader-friendly!)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="VERY HAPPY!!! A MUST SEE!!!"></head><body><p>Overall, this is a good movie.  The story is very good, and very tongue and cheek with views and belief.  As for the HD version, GREAT, and has tons of Supplements/Extra/Features, it was definitely worth with the "IN-Depth" that comes with the movie! I'm happy to say that "IF" you like this movie, then buy the HD version of it, I wasn't a fan of this Movie, but I bought it because i knew the HD would be awesome, and it didn't disappoint me, and then for some reason, I was watching the movie, and I was like, "Wow, this is a pretty good movie."  Again, Mr. Reeves, isn't the best actor, BUT he did OK, enough to not ruin the movie.  This is a great movie!  I would recommend atleast checking it out! :) Awesome picture!</p></body></html>

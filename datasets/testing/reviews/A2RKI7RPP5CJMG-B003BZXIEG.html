<meta name="summary" content="I Went To An X-Men Movie....."></head><body><p>...and the Storm/Wolverine show burst onto the scene.  Yeah, yeah, I know that Wolverine is quite possibly the most famous X-man out there, but this is supposed to be the "X-Men."  Rumor has it that Halle Berry was throwing fits over having such a small role in the other films and refused to do this installment unless her character was given a bigger piece of the pie.  Unfortunately, director Brett Ratner gave in to her request, leaving us with an another uninspired performance by Berry.<br /><br />The story goes like this:  Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) returns as Phoenix, dispatches some major characters and, guess what, Magneto (Sir Ian McKellan) is still trying to raise that blasted army of mutants.  Oh, and the feds seem to have created a "cure" for mutants by way of Leech, played by that freaky little boy that always plays the freaky little boy (Cameron Bright).  The plan is that mutants can "voluntarily" take the antidote and be "cured" of their mutation.  Naturally, Magneto takes this as a threat and rounds up Pyro, Mystique, Callisto, Multiple Man, Juggernaut, and others to recruit a mutant army to storm the island where the cure is being manufactured (that island being Alcatraz).<br /><br />The special effects are wonderful for the most part, but Ratner seems to have depended too heavily on these effects to move the story along.  Where the first two films actually tried to deal with the discrimination of mutants, this flick tosses all intelligence aside and goes into full-yet somehow boring-action mode.<br /><br />As stated before, Storm is given a huge amount of screen time.  She becomes the unofficial leader of the X-men and has somehow lost that weird accent she had in the first two flicks.  She is very annoying to watch as the film develops.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is also given a large amount of time onscreen, but haven't we seen plenty of him in the first two flicks?  Colossus showed up, but he was nothing more than a hood ornament.  Iceman  (Shawn Ashmore) does develop a little better than he did in X-2, but he doesn't get much screen time.  Rogue (Anna Paquin) is almost non-existent in this film.  Her little love triangle with Iceman and Kitty Pryde never really develops.<br /><br />Mentioning Pryde, there are a couple of new additions to the X-men in this flick.  Kelsey Grammar does a wonderful job with the minute role he has as Dr. Hank McCoy, better known as Beast.  Ben Foster flaps on and off the screen in a brief role (it could almost qualify as a cameo) as Angel.  The villains include the aforementioned Multiple Man, Shadowkat, a number of needless little thugs and Vinnie Jones who almost single-handedly saved this flick as Juggernaut.<br /><br />The language in this film was senseless.  I have no problem with fowl language in films where necessary, but it seems as if most of the cursing in this film was thrown in just to give the characters a little more of an edge.  The "B" word was tossed around non-chalantly, even used for humor's sake.  I just believe that the language could have been patched up a little more.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />Okay, I've covered the flick fairly well, now let me get to a couple of really bad gripes I had with this flick.<br /><br />First of all, two major characters are killed off very quickly:  Professor X and Cyclops.  Professor X is given a little bit of respect and his death was pretty decent, but it was as if poor Cyclops never even existed once he was offed.  Rumors are that James Marsden was written out of the script quickly when it was found out that he was part of the new "Superman Returns" flick.  I hope he does well.  Cyclops was treated horribly this time around.<br /><br />Also, there was absolutely no explanation given for the absence of Nightcrawler in this flick.  Fans of the comic might know that he became a priest for a time, but we weren't even told that.<br /><br />One last thing, did Rebecca Romjin do anything to tick off the folks at Marvel?  Her character, Mystique, was critical to the development of both of the other films in this series.  She was one of the best villains in the lot.  Full of intrigue, sly wit, and even a little heart, Mystique is tossed off unceremoniously in this third go-round.  Granted, they try to make her a little important by having her help the feds, but she's wasted in this installment.<br /><br />In all, this is the worst of the "X-Men" flicks so far.  Hopefully this signals the end of the story, though even that is in question if you watch through to the end of the credits.  I'm almost positive that there'll be a "Wolverine" movie soon, but, to be honest, I've grown somewhat tired of the character.  Hopefully, if there is another "X" movie, Storm will get offed as early and unceremoniously as Cyclops.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Quirky, atmospheric--and an utter delight to watch!"></head><body><p>Elvis is alive and well--ok, maybe not too well.  He threw out his hip a long time ago, and he's aged quite a bit.  He's living in a retirement home in East Texas, along with a new friend--who, despite his skin color, believe he's John F. Kennedy.<br /><br />No one believes that Elvis is really who he says he is.  But his annonymity and age are about to become obsolete...because a new presence has invaded this rest home: a cowboy-hat wearing, soul-eating mummy, one with an attitude, a voracious appetite, a hoarde of scarabs, and one bad complexion.  Together, Elvis and JFK must stop this mummy before it's too late!<br /><br />Like I said--quirky.  Bruce Campbell is at his best--sarcastic, bitter, and yet surprisingly sensitive; his portrayal of Elvis is both loving and satirical.  Ossie Davis, as JFK, is an absolute wonder to watch; these two great actors play off each other wonderfully.  And then there is the directing, the script, the atmosphere...this is one horror-comedy that's guaranteed to delight.  "Bubba Ho-Tep" is one film you can't afford to miss, whether you're 14, 40...or 4,000.</p></body></html>

His brother studied earthquakes and volcanoes.  But the university is losing interest and it looks like the lab will be shut down.<br /><br />That same day, Trevor's nephew is dumped on his door step for a few days.  Trevor hasn't seen Sean (Josh Hutcherson) in years.  It looks to be an awkward time until Trevor finds an old copy of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth that his brother had marked up.  As he begins to interpret his brother's comments, he begins to think there may be more going on than he knows about.<br /><br />As so the two set off to Iceland.  Hiring Hannah (Anita Briem), they set out to recover a probe.  But a series of events find them falling into a magical world.  Can they find their way out?<br /><br />I went in expecting a highly fun, fantasy adventure.  And I got just what I had bargained for.  The movie takes a fairly healthy dose of suspension of belief, but considering the premise, I didn't have a problem with that at all.<br /><br />This is a special effects heavy movie with the plot at times being nothing but an excuse for them.  But they were amazing.  And the plot works, too.  Yes, it's predictable, but it is fun, so that didn't matter to me.<br /><br />Granted, it helped that I cared for the characters.  And the acting by the three leads was good enough to draw me into the story.<br /><br />For all my praise, I do have two complaints.  The first is the pacing.  The movie took a little too long setting things up before the adventure really started.  Secondly, the ads for the movie gave away too much of the story.  I sure wish marketing departments would figure that out.<br /><br />The film is rated PG due to the action elements.  It will be too intense for kids who get scared easily.  But any kids who can handle some suspense will love it.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a family movie night, give this one a chance.  If your kids won't be scared by it, you'll all enjoy an amazing trip.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gratuitous violence and ridiculous action sequences - but hilarious"></head><body><p>Have you ever wanted to be a superhero. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG9846">Kick-Ass</a> is about four very different people who take very different paths to become superheroes. With a few exceptions, they do provide some innovative fighting scenes and hilarious moments.<br /><br />First, the great. One of the superheroes, Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), is a adorable 10-year old girl who has a passion for guns and slaughtering bad guys the way other young girls get excited for jewelry or dolls. Chloe is a great actress and gives her character a unique spunk and energy. In several scenes, she has the best fighting scenes and is absolutely merciless. She easily steals the show.<br /><br />The fighting scenes are also pretty cool. Make no mistake - this is a violent movie. But unlike a lot of other fighting movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG9846">Kick-Ass</a> is willing to be original in terms of who gets killed and how. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that somebody knows how to use a knife very well. At times, you won't know whether to be disgusted by the violence or laughing at the absurdity.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG9846">Kick-Ass</a> also sets up the contrasts between the mundane and superhero worlds really well. The high school world of teen romance and comic books looks petty in comparison with the blood and gore of the fight scenes. Also, the corny superhero names and goofy costumes contrasted with the deadly seriousness of the characters - what a riot. And, of course Chloe Moretz as a cute little girl who swears like a truck driver and kills like a commando is the ultimate mind-boggling contrast in this movie.<br /><br />I did feel the movie went a bit far in some scenes. Some scenes were just filled with gratuitously bloodshed and outright murder. I still don't get why Hollywood has abandoned the art of panning away right before the victim gets killed (interestingly enough, the only time <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG9846">Kick-Ass</a> does spare you the sight of blood is when a female gets killed). I think the movie would actually have benefitted from a bit less explicit gore and more innuendo.<br /><br />I also thought the rest of the casting was alright, but not stellar. I've never been a fan of Nicholas Cage, and this movie convinced me that his acting just isn't up to it. The contrast between him and Chloe Moretz - his daughter in the movie - is striking. Aaron Johnson is decent as the dorky Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, but gets overshadowed halfway through the film - his character reaches his peak too quickly. Mark Strong as the druglord villain just doesn't convince. We're supposed to fear and hate his character, but really he just comes across as a good excuse to kick some ass.<br /><br />Overall, I'd warn sensitive types away from this movie. This is a comedy only in the darkest sense. However, if you like a few laughs, a bit of fighting, and a lot of both mixed together, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG9846">Kick-Ass</a> works wonders. It's original, fresh, and funny. But for some of the casting and excess in gore, I feel it could even have become an action-hero classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="PETER BERG, OPUS 4"></head><body><p>** 2007. Directed by Peter Berg. When a terrorist attack kills dozens of American citizens in Saudi Arabia, four FBI agents are sent to Ryadh to find out who's responsible for the killing. Very weak effort from a director who gave us <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007ELER">Very Bad Things</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNEW">Friday Night Lights (Widescreen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016MSV2">The Rundown (Widescreen Edition)</a> a few years ago. The camera work is ridiculous, the screenplay inept and the message conveyed by the film questionable to say the least. I felt like watching a 110 minutes long episode of CSI:Ryadh, it's as simple as that. Inadvisable.</p></body></html>

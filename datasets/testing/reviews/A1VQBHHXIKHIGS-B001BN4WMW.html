I spent the first hour waiting for something to happen, and when it finally did I found it difficult to care. The second hour had me laughing where it was supposed to, and I learned that the great thing about kilts is you can moon the British army. Hundreds of bare white backsides, or frontsides if you prefer. The third hour was a bit long. This was a loaner, and I fast-forwarded through all the action scenes, so it wasn't so bad. Since so many of my students write about it, I guess I had to watch it. I solved some crossword puzzles at the same time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="one of Michael Mann's better movies..."></head><body><p>"Collateral" certainly kept me entertained, even though the last 15 minutes was just an onslaught of implausibilities.<br /><br />Like all Michael Mann movies, this is mainly an exercise in style, i.e. snappy, eye-catching camera work and atmospherics.  Tom Cruise actually does some half-decent acting here for a change, and looks far less flaky than usual with a head full of salt-n-pepper (mostly salt) hair.  Of course the real show-stealer is Jamie Foxx, and it was a shame we didn't get to see more of Jada Pinkett Smith, ooh la la what a goddess!<br /><br />"Collateral" tries to dabble in "carpe diem" existentialism here and there, but by the ending Hollywood has kicked in and it degenerates into yet another predictable save-the-world-and-the-babe formula action flick.  The rest of the time it's very competent at what it does.</p></body></html>

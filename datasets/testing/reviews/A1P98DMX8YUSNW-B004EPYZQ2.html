The finale goes rather unexplained, as well, when the typical space monster somehow manages to morph a bunch of earthly metal junk into a space ship in a matter of seconds. Say what? Prior to those letdowns, this modern-day Speilberg production features his usual band of cute kids getting into trouble, but avoiding anything really bad happening to them because of their wide-eyed innocence. If you enjoy that formula, you will like this otherwise high quality production. Just don't expect any logic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="As good as the first, if not better 4 and 1/2 Stars"></head><body><p>In that rare occasion, which actually seems to be happening a lot more, the sequel lives up to the thrill of the first movie.<br /><br />Very rarely do we see movies where the sequel is an honest continuation of the first movie.  Only in movies like the Matrix and Lord of Rings, where we know there will be a third before we even go see the second.<br /><br />In this case, we have an episode in the Jason Bourne character's chronicles.  Living a peaceful life in India, he suddenly realizes he is being chased again.  This is in direct conflict with the agreement he made with his pursuers in the first movie.<br /><br />He wastes no time in showing them that coming after him is a huge mistake.  Plots twists abound as he uncovers the reason someone is suddenly trying to kill him again.  The action is intense, the story moves fast and we always left guessing.<br /><br />There isn't a lot to do as far as intense acting goes, but all actors make the most of what they have.  Brian Cox is always good and he is no different here.  Joan Allen, also reliable in all roles, makes a strong and commanding presence as the woman determined to find out more about Bourne.  Damon is great, always with a look of determination mixed with a bit of confusion.<br /><br />This is a great spy/action thriller with great performances and enough action to leave you exhausted.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

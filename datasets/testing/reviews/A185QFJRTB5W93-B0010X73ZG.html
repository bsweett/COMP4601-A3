<meta name="summary" content="King's Films Still Pack A Punch"></head><body><p>I am not sure when it became "cool" to bash Stephen King, but most of the reviews here that do are shallow and contrite.  Much like the overlooked Dreamcatcher, The Mist takes the viewer on a thrill ride packed with characters who represent the extremes in everyday life.  But isn't that what you are supposed to do in a film about the microcosm of society pressed into two hours?  I am not going to give any simple recap of the film, because reviews like that are useless.  Here's what you need to know...if you like creepy, gut-wrenching horror that packs an intelligent and unapologetic punch, then The Mist is right up your alley.  This is the fun, classic King at his best (a la Creep Show).  There were two items that bothered me about the film, however.  The "creature" too similar to the ones from Dreamcatcher....and, if we're going to use a "parallel dimension" as the cause for the creatures...I think more creativity could have gone into their design.  That being said, this movie is clearly in my top ten horror films of all time list.  Highly Recommended!!!</p></body></html>

No, there were many different problems, but the biggest one I had with it was that it awkwardly shifted between horror and sci-fi, and doing neither effectively.<br /><br />Actually the horror aspect wasn't so bad, I got truly scared when I first saw one of the scientists had a pink mowhawk and tattoos. I was really scared for how the movie would turn out. So a crew is sent on a trillion dollar mission to search for life on a distant planet, judging by the sheer enormity of the mission you'd think they'd send only the best and brightest right? Well no, not at all. Almost every crew member makes completely baffling stupid decisions throughout the movie, and the ones that don't make stupid decisions are completely underutilized.<br /><br />Once they arrive on the planet, they drive down one little valley to the 'tomb' or whatever is located, so that's all you see of the planet, that little valley and the one tomb, ok whatever. So they get into the 'tomb' and one of them decides to pull off his helmet because the air is breatheable. Ok? So what if it's breatheable, what about alien viruses, toxins, bacteria, aren't you guys supposed to be really smar-oh great now they're all removing their helmets. So Ridley Scott made this movie to appeal to mouth-breathing neanderthals, ok whatever maybe it'll be a good horror movie.<br /><br />So the Punk Scientist (I can't believe what I'm typing) and his ambigiously gay friend go split off from everyone in true bad horror movie writing, and can't find their way out for plot convience. Eventually they get trapped inside the tomb because of a storm and the ship is monitering them. Well only one guys is monitering these two idiots stranded on a planet and all he says to them is 'sleep tight' then laughs at his gay joke. Don't worry it gets dumber. Charlize Thereon, who's made out to be this cold calculating badass captain decides to sleep with the only guy watching the two stranded crew guys, and I think it was at this point where I started chucking candy at the screen. This was directed by the same guy that did Alien, Black Hawk Down, and Gladiator?<br /><br />So the two scientists are scared s***less about the crew finding other signs of life in the tomb, but when some snake-like creature comes out of the water they're next to, what do they do? Well the choice is obvious, stick your arm out and try to pet it. Then goofus and gallant get picked off in admittably creepy ways while the whole crew on Prometheus is busy f***ing each other. Later in another scene the captain realizes that one of the crewmembers is contaminated and can't come back on the ship, however later when one of the idiots who's been missing for like a day comes back the crew just opens up the hatch without checking him out first, not realizing that the guy is now some angry giant mutant straight outta the Hills Have Eyes.<br /><br />So it seems like this is going to go for to pure adrenline-rushing horror, but instead Prometheus takes a left turn and brings Guy Pearce in a cheap old man costume out for no reason other than to throw in a tweest, and none of the crew members seem to care, I sure as hell didn't. The rest of the movie turns into some stupid social commentary, such as "they ain't stupid 'nuff to build weapons of mass destruction on their front doorstep" or "what did we do to deserve to die"? Great, now this movie thinks it's smart.<br /><br />So Prometheus could've been a solid albeit dumb horror movie, but instead it tries to expand upon it's vague half-baked typical self-loathing hollywood message that humans don't deserve to live. Then Ridley Scott shoves his 'working class good, corporations bad' message AGAIN. We see the white collar members are up to no good, scheming behind everyone's back while the cool down to earth blue collar guys are the good guys. The crew don't even get picked off in a tense cool way of getting hunted or anything, they ram their ship into another ship, dying in the lamest way possible. See kids, Prometheus is too smart to be fun.<br /><br />So later the crew with Old Guy pearce meet up with the engineer who was sleeping and when they wake him up, does he want to communicate with the beings that he supposedly created? Does he want to assess the situation to know there's a giant ship outside ready to ram his if he tries to escape? Nope, he goes on a gorilla rampage beating everyone then jumps into his ship. Then after the multi-cultural blue collar folks ram into his ship the two leading ladies are being chased by the donut-shaped ship rolling along, only one of them realizing that you should move out of the direction that it's rolling in.<br /><br />Prometheus is a flat out disappointment. Nice set designs and atmosphere don't erase poor script-writing and a geniuenly lame story, Prometheus is made for idiots who want to pretend that they're smart.</p></body></html>

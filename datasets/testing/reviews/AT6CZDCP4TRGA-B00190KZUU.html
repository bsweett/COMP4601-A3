<meta name="summary" content="Big Disappointment"></head><body><p>This film has lots of memorable scenes and moments, visually and imaginatively---the problem is that they don't really mesh to form a cohesive whole.  Tim Burton's technical prowess is unquestionable, but his storytelling leaves something to be desired.  <p>Ewan McGregor (how the Scotsman pulled off the Alabama accent is amazing) and the talented cast do a great job, it's just that the story kind of fizzles out towards the last 30 minutes.  All spectacle and no real center, no real soul.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Yes, it's as bad as its reputation...."></head><body><p>I don't know why, but I decided to watch this one afternoon, despite my general contempt for Hollywood romantic comedies.  Well, the contempt just got bigger.  This is a wretchingly poor film, one of the most tired, unbelievable (even by abysmally low Hollywood romantic comedy standards), and boring films I've seen in a while.<br /><br />First of all, the main story of Vaughn and Aniston getting together and being a full fledged couple is garbage.  It's another variation of the overbearing, obnoxious slob (Vaughn, who plays an obnoxious, terminally immature tour guide in Chicago) with a cerebral, intelligent woman who works in an art gallery (Aniston).  These two would NEVER get together in real life, much start a real relationship.  Opposite may attract, but these two are at the furthest opposite ends of the pole.  And at the beginning of the film when Vaughn and Aniston meet, she says she's with someone.  Who was this guy?  Was he so bad that she would dump him for an overbearing, but charming at first sight, jerk like Vaughn?  Well, I've seen some women dump the nicest, most caring guys for completely selfish, immature jerks, and regret it years later, so maybe there's a bit a truth in that.  Regardless...<br /><br />The dialogue in the film is worse than a made for TV movie.  It's badly written, and Vaughn and Anniston can't make the material any better.  Vaughn is rather one note in his career, always playing obnoxious, over confident guys like this, and Anniston, as beautiful as she is, is not a particularly good actress.  She has limited range.  The film seems very long at 90 minutes, and it's ulimately grueling to watch to the end.  There's a few laughs (mostly from Anniston's singing brother, but even those are overdone), but overall, it's one of the worst films I've seen in a very long time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An odd, disturbing and unrealistic film, but compelling nevertheless."></head><body><p>Thanks to an outstanding performance by Kevin Costner, this "been there done that" psycho-killer film is worth watching.<br /><br />We are all very familiar with Costner's "gosh gee-whiz" persona in his early career with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322611X">Field of Dreams</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007MAO0M">Silverado</a> and later at playing either a villain, as in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RCOA">A Perfect World</a>, or a very flawed and unfriendly hero as he was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783219857">Waterworld</a>, but we have never quite seen him as such a complex psychopathic villain as in he is in "Mr. Brooks."<br /><br />Here Costner takes a stab (pun intended) as a serial killer trying to stop his murderous addiction, but ends up being blackmailed by a witness, oddly played by comedian Dane Cook, to his last murder.  Unbelievably, he is turned on to murder after seeing Costner's Mr. Brooks do away with his neighbors and wants him to take him under his wing or he will go to the police with his proof that puts Brooks at the scene of his last murder.  Mr. Brooks decides to string this guy along until he is no longer useful and that is where some really decent plot twists take place.  One significant plot twist is that Mr. Brooks' daughter, well played by Daniella Panabacker, is accused of murder back at her college dorm.  Is she innocent or just like her father?<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is a compelling film that has a few distracting and significant problems.  This film is both graphic in its violence and sexual scenes, but neither seems really gratuitous.  That's a plus for me.  In addition, Costner's brilliant performance is absolutely captivating, especially to his long-term followers who have never seen him in a role like this one.  He has definitely grown as an actor and this is one juicy role for him.  The performances by all others in this film, including Demi Moore's are good, if nothing special.  The problems come from some unbelievable elements within the plot and one actor who is a great distraction, William Hurt.<br /><br />Plot Problems:<br /><br />(1) What are the odds that a neighbor who witnesses a murder would get so turned on by it that he would contact the killer to seek "training"?  That is just too far-fetched even for me.<br /><br />(2) Why does Demi Moore's character of a cop have to also be a millionaire, be going through a divorce, and have a convicted killer be after her?  It is all just too much for this story.  The film comes close to sinking under its own unnecessarily heavy plot weight.<br /><br />(3) The film comes off as being too contrived like many of Alfred Hitchcock's films had been.  All enjoyable, but you feel very manipulated afterwards.<br /><br />Acting Problems:<br /><br />(1) Dane Cook as the guy blackmailing Mr. Brooks to teach him murder is never quite convincing in the role, but perhaps that is because his role, as a whole, is just too far beyond belief to take seriously anyhow.  To his credit he does play "slimy" pretty well.<br /><br />(2) I swear to God that if I never see William Hurt in this kind of role again, I'd die a happy man.  He's done this bad guy with no conscience thing to death in his older years that he now comes off as a parody of himself.  He is a distraction in what should have been a key and captivating role as Mr. Brooks' alter ego convincing him to keep on killing (no one sees or hears him but Mr. Brooks).  An unknown actor might have been a better choice for this role.<br /><br />Well, in spite of its serious flaws, this was still a riveting thriller and well worth your viewing.  In a year of so-so films and no big standout performances, Kevin Costner's work here is Oscar nomination worthy (and about time too).</p></body></html>

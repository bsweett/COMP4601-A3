<meta name="summary" content="Early Zombie, rough but good"></head><body><p>Four young college graduate are making their way across the U.S., writing a travel book of roadside attractions. Captain Spaulding's murder ride is too much to pass up, as is his crazy good fried chicken. But the ride puts them on the trail of local hero Dr. Satan, the never-captured serial killer, and through a carefully orchestrated set of events, the quartet find themselves being entertained by the Firefly family, who make serial killing a family business. Growing surrealism succeeds in creating a funhouse rollercoaster ride of murder and mayhem. Not Zombie's best movie; his first time out, the result is rough and overflowing with what will become Zombie trademarks. You may want to start with Zombie's Halloween, to learn how he thinks before taking on the Fireflys.</p></body></html>

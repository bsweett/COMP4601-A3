<meta name="summary" content="Numersous Secrets to Success are Shown in "Forrest Gump""></head><body><p>Year of release: 1994<br />Writers: Winston Groom (who wrote the novel) and Eric Roth<br />Director: Robert Zemeckis<br />Runtime: 2 hours 22 minutes<br /><br />I haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.<br /><br />THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.<br /><br />"Forrest Gump" is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any creedance to their judgment ("American Beauty," best picture? Please) but "Forrest Gump" is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.<br /><br />Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exagerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:<br /><br />-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talant.<br /><br />-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: "If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none."<br /><br />-- Mastering your talants will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).<br /><br />-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.<br /><br />-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.<br /><br />-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).<br /><br />-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.<br /><br />-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).<br /><br />-- Keep your word.<br /><br />-- Pray and have FAITH.<br /><br />-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.<br /><br />We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.<br /><br />From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means "struggles with God" (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?<br /><br />Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a "golden connection" in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: "One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor."<br /><br />Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiance at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (This is great acting on Sinise's part).<br /><br />"Forrest Gump" is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels. Not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another Sommers CGI Orgy"></head><body><p>Before saying anything else, let me state that this was a fun film to watch, though not much involved real human actors.  Stephen Sommers is clearly one of those directors so enamored with CGI technology that plot and acting get lost in the mix.  The two 'Mummy' films were very similar to 'Helsing', in that effects ruled them rather than storyline.<br /><br />The plot is literally all over the place, with monsters, characters, and geography passing by without much audience notice.  Hugh Jackman really is a fine actor, but you hardly get a chance to see it in this film (wonder how he felt about doing  virtually no acting in the final climactic battle sequence ?); he does a few weapons tricks and some one-liners-that's about it.  Kate Beckinsale looks great (how could she breathe in that corset?), but seems lost among all the flying wirework; like Jackman, she has minimal dialogue.<br /><br />The effects work in 'Van Helsing' is spectacular, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film gets an Oscar nomination in that category.  However, this along with the bombastic soundtrack crowds out what really makes for a good movie: good acting and a competent plot.  The irony is that Sommers eagerly states how much he 'enjoys' writing screenplays for his films (in the extra features).  I just don't see it here or in his other big movies.<br /><br />Nevertheless, 'Van Helsing' is a fun if uninspiring way to spend two hours...</p></body></html>

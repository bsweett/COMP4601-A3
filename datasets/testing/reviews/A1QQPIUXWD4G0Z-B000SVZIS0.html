<meta name="summary" content="Burton Goes Ape"></head><body><p>A poor adaptation of Pierre Boule's original book and of the original film starring Charlton Heston: there's no comparison and I don't mean that as a compliment. Another typical Burton caricature production which seems more like something prepared as advertisement for a McDonald's Happy Meal promotional toy collection.<br /><br />  The story now takes place on some distant planet instead of Earth where Mark Wahlberg lands by accident while conducting a chimp-pilot experiment. Trapped on what becomes a hostile ape planet, he gets help from good apes to fight the bad ones. Predictable plot, no character depth, and no real story worth pondering over; only a poorly directed bubble-gum film prepared for mass-consumption and aimed at your pubescent audience. I give it two stars only because the special effects were very well done.  All of the satirical elements present in Rod Serling's original script have been removed to leave nothing of worth except stupid anachnronisms, placid human faces, and a simply atrocious screenplay. Whereas the original movie had a profound message about social evolution and ignorance, this movie is but a noble experiment in computer animation and nothing more.<br /><br />  It's fun renting it to watch one time; the second time you see that Burton is just monkeying you around. If you're counting on seeing an improved rendition of the original film, you'll be sorely disappointed.</p></body></html>

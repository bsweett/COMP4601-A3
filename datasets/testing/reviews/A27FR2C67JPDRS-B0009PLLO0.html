<meta name="summary" content="Alexander the Bland"></head><body><p>Before I start complaining about this film, let me say right off that I like Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins.  I've been looking forward to this film for months now, since I saw the first preview but Oliver Stone let me down.  Unlike others who have problems with Colin's performance or Angelina's vampy Olympias, I lay full blame on Oliver Stone.  The movie did not flow with the constant moving back and forth in time and Mr. Stone did not try to capture the real spirit of Alexander the Great.  Anthony Hopkin's Ptolemy is one of his weakest and least interesting roles he's ever played and would have been better left out of the movie.  I think the film would have been better had Stone told Alexander's life straight out, ditching the narrator and focusing on the life of an amazing warrior.<br /><br />Stone leads the viewer to believe that Alexander, though married three times, also enjoyed the (sexual) company of men----Hephaestion, his long time best friend (played by Jared Leto) and Bagoas, a persian eunuch.  The scenes are vague and leave a great deal to the viewer's imagination.  If he was gonna include this point of view about Alexander's life, he should have not been afraid to explore these relationships.  The sexual tension between Alexander and Hephaestion was much more interesting than the relationship between Alexander and his first wife, Roxane (played by Rosario Dawson).  Their violent first night of love making was unbelievable and completely void of any chemistry.<br /><br />As for the performances, Colin did fairly well with the poorly directed role he was given.  By far, the most interesting was Angelina Jolie's scheming Olympias, a woman determined to see her son become king, at any cost.  And as for Anthony Hopkins, he should have passed on this role---it was boring, not worthy of an actor of his caliber.<br /><br />I read recently that Baz Lurhmann has decided not to direct his version of Alexander.  After Stone's messy and disappointing tale of the man who conquered 90% of the known world, I hope Lurhman will reconsider.  Alexander the Great deserves a better movie than this want-to-be epic that is basically a snooze-fest.  I'm giving it two stars for Angelina Jolie's vampy turn as the Queen and Colin Farrell's performance, both of whom can still do a good job even when in a really bad film.</p></body></html>

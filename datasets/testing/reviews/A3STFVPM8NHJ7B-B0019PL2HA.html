<meta name="summary" content="Whats the difference?"></head><body><p>I saw the movie in theaters and then I bought the unrated version. There is not much of a differnce; The only scene I saw as new was a sterotypical black man dropping a few f bombs to Ricky. Thats it? Im so sick of these unrated movies coming out. Mostly every comedy and horror film that is released today will get the "unrated" version with stuff that they couldnt show in theaters or so they claim. I really cant remember every buying an unrated version of a film and thinking it was better then the orignal version. As with the 40 Year Old Virgin, a comedy should not exceed more then an hour and forty five minutes. This movie is two hours and two minutes. A few funny scenes here and there but no comedy gold.</p></body></html>

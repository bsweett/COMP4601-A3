<meta name="summary" content="This whodunit illusion looks even better on Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>The Illusionist<br />Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack<br /><br />Newly released on Blu-Ray on June 8th, "The Illusionist" was originally released in 2006 and was written and directed by Neil Burger based on the short story, "Eisenheim the Illusionist" written by Steven Millhauser. Edward Norton plays the great illusionist, Eisenheim who finds his childhood love, Sophie played by Jessica Biel is engaged to Crown Prince Leopold played by Rufus Sewell. The city's Chief Inspector Uhl and the prince become obsessed with Eisenheim's association with Sophie and how his illusions are done until a mysterious crime takes place and a major investigation begins.<br /><br />The special effects are amazing in this movie and the Blu-Ray quality only adds to the magic. The acting is pretty top-notch bringing American, English, and German actors all towards a soft Viennese accent. Edward Norton is wonderfully guarded and mysterious throughout the film and learned some of the hand trickery from actual magicians. Paul Giamatti is characteristically gruff, but at times difficult to understand and awkward. His eyes say volumes about what his lines don't reveal. Jessica Biel is beautiful and keeps it simple which seems to be the best way to play it in this case. This was one of her first roles outside the norm of popular romantic comedy and television fare. Rufus Sewell has an admirable performance as the villain, all of whose lines could be taken as guilty or innocent, but he could have been a little more menacing or crazy. The story is like a well-played chess game with Eisenheim always a few steps ahead of his pursuers and a very enjoyable ride.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The bonus features are ONLY on the DVD, not the Blu-Ray disc. They include feature length commentary with writer/director Niel Burger, the Making of The Illusionist, and Jessica Biel on the Illusionist. The commentary by Burger is very interesting since he explains how each illusion would be done and points out some historical facts about the shooting location and its connections to Archduke Ferdinand whose death began World War I.<br /><br />The making of featurette is less than four minutes long and it is just a series of the main actors explaining their characters and the plot. The Jessica Biel segment has the same interviews as in the "making of" featurette with a few more seconds of her saying she sought out the film since it was the next type of project she wanted to do and lasts less than two minutes.<br /><br />This combo allows you to get what is already available on DVD with no further extras, except a Blu-Ray disc with fantastic picture to make the illusions even more illusion-y!</p></body></html>

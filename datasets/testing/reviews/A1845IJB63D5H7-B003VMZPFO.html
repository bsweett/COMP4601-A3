An Ebola-like outbreak erupted in a small rural town which resulted in transforming the infected persons into a vicious belligerent killers.  The rumors quickly spread that hunters located  a sunken airplane where the source of the infection seems to have spread. The signs of the disease spread quickly, got the attention of the local Sheriff with the sudden increase in criminal activities of unexpected transformation of individuals.<br /><br />On the other side of society, the government had already determined to exterminate the whole infected population in order to spare the rest from the spread of the deadly virus. Unbeknown to the local Sheriff, who was occupied by deciphering the local crimes, the National Guard was dispatched to seal the town, quarantine the infected population, and destroy all moving escapees. Within the quarantined population, the infected ones turned against the living individuals and reeked havoc, death, and terror within the isolated and sealed zone.<br /><br />The vast might of the state enabled it to track all moving escapees by airborne robotics and tightly control the spread of individuals. The whole town must die, either from the leaked deadly virus or the inflicted victims whose belligerence was caused by the infection.<br /><br />The movie embodies the fears of many people of the uncontrolled and poorly scrutinized government biological research. As some who believe that AIDS was an experimental virus that was designed to eradicate homosexuals and blacks, the movie displays the struggle between the mighty and the almighty.  The Sheriff of the town, whose wife was a doctor, was the last to know about his government's plot to exterminate his own town, including him and his family.<br /><br />The First Amendment of the Constitution that secures the peoples' right to carry arms was defeated by the overwhelming might of the state compared to the small, isolated fire arms that lacks the organization and vast resources of the state. Or, one might wish to believe that the escape of the Sheriff and his wife was made possible by their access to fire arms.<br /><br />Like many science fiction movies that succeeded in predicting the future course of society, The Crazies contributes to the pools of thoughts on that trend. It was bloody, frightening, and gloomy, from start to end.  In the real word, the Anthrax deliberate leak from the governmental laboratories followed the same train of thoughts of this movie, despite of being an isolated act of a deranged man.</p></body></html>

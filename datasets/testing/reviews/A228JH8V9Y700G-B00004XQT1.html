It is grusome, horrible and gory, but at the same time oddly cute at times.  It portrays a period in time and a certain mentality, but at the same time transcends to present day.<br /><br />Patrick Bateman is the yuppie scum we grew to hate: arrogant, materialistic, and self serving.  Yet, at the same time while being psychotic, he longs for substance.  He seeks it out in friends, job and social life, and finds nothing.  Instead he becomes obsessed with the most trivial of insignifigant things (ex. designer clothes), going so far as to obsess over the subtle watermarks on a business card.  His friends and aquaintance are so shallow they confuse him with someone else and he's happy to play into it.  Why shouldn't he?  No one knows the difference or takes the time out to realize it.  Maybe this is more a comment on our culture despite the yuppie / 80s backdrop.  People really are not all that concerned with more than themselves.  Perhaps none of us have true friends, it's all an illusion.  I believe that, I believe a lot of that to be true.<br /><br />One of the oddest things I found about this movie was Patrick's relationship with his girlfriend.  While she is just as shallow and rude as the others, she has an odd hold over him that no one else seems to.  He doesn't exactly follow her orders, but she seems to have almost a mothering effect on him.  Patrick seems almost afraid of her, and when he finally ends the relationship he almost apologizes when he takes joy in hurting others.<br /><br />Many people were angry about the sex scenes.  If anything they were just ridiculous (how about that scene of him flexing and posturing before the mirror with those two hookers while playing Phil Collins songs?!).  Want a real horror story, read the book.  It's disturbing, but then again that's the point of the movie.</p></body></html>

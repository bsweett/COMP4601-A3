<meta name="summary" content="Above-average espionage thriller"></head><body><p>I have neither read the book or seen the original, so taken as a &quot;stand-alone&quot; piece for me, this film works on many levels.  Matt Damon proves his acting prowess here, being able to pull-off action while not being wooden or glib.  Not as easy as one might think.<p>Sure there are the fingerprints of many other films in the genre all over this script and production, but that doesn't prevent it from succeeding where it intends to go.<p>I appreciate the production values and the overall feel -- very consistent and focused.  Franka Potente is a delight as well.<p>All in all, a good start on what is most likely another spy-film franchise.</p></body></html>

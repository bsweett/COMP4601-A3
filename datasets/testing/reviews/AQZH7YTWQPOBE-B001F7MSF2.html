<meta name="summary" content="Better than the first, but still sub-par"></head><body><p>I wasn't crazy about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AK3S4Y">Hellboy</a>. This sequel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F7MSG6">Hellboy II: The Golden Army [Blu-ray</a>]is a bit better, but still suffers from similar problems. The special effects - trolls, elves, etc - just didn't look that realistic to me. The plot was again pretty silly, but at least the villains were better. If you liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AK3S4Y">Hellboy</a>, you'll probably like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F7MSG6">Hellboy II: The Golden Army [Blu-ray</a>] better. If you didn't like the first one, this one's probably not worth your time.</p></body></html>

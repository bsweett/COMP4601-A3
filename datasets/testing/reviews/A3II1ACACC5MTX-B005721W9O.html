Robert Downey Junior pretends he is a black character and Martin Shortt is a former childstar with a famed "quick draw." Ok, well, its Tropic Thunder and 3 Amigos which features the same plot, but this spoof out does them both. The humour is dry and the character observation spot on. I wonder if Bill Shatner has seen it and if he recognised himself in it. Rickman is wonderful as cynical "Dr Lazarus". The whole film is a little lads' fantasy and one that I'm sure appeals to us chaps in our adult world, who wouldn't want to be suddenly in command of a real star ship tasked with saving the Galaxy?<br /><br />What I particularly like is the reluctance of most of the actors to be associated with their work. I remember attending a conference and hosting Blackadder star Tony Robinson some years ago. The PR people had one word of instruction, we were under no circumstances to refer to him as "Balders" or "Baldrick" as he is particularly un-humorous when it comes to being associated with one of the best comic creations of recent times. Well, what else are you going to say to him?  Its true, je doesn't like being called Balders! He should have got a job on a checkout if that is his attitude! Humph.<br /><br /> This is one of those brilliantly watchable films you can safely add to your dvd collection as it can be watched many times and still be funny. Would highly recommend a double bill of Galaxy Quest and "Mystery Men" for an enjoyable "beers in/wife out" evening of entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Makes Columbine look like an Easter Pageant"></head><body><p>Carrie ranks with the Exorcist as one of the all time great horror film classics.  Steven King's best novel directed by Brian DePalma and starring my favorite actress, Sissy Spacek, the film shot in '76 shows what '70s  high school is all about.  The characters in the film are divided  between essentially good (Carrie, Betty Buckley, Amy Irving, Tommy Ross)  and essentially evil (Nancy Allen, John Travolta, Piper Laurie).  The film  has some important messages to it.  One is how ironic it is that religious  fanaticism could be the basis for evil, which this film and much of human  history proves.  Another is how &quot;group think&quot; can easily devolve  into evil, in this case the high school in-crowd where you must be evil to  be accepted.  3rd, the most purely good character in the film is Carrie  herself, a victim of the evil of her mother and classmates...not too  unbelievable a scenario for high school outcasts.  One note on the  widely misinterpreted prom scene:  as everyone who's read the book knows,  everyone's not laughing at Carrie, only the girl in on the prank is.  Everyone else is only imagined to be laughing by Carrie.  Finally the  film is a statement against the in-crowd vs. outcast mentality pervasive in  high schools and society in general.  Columbine and all the other high  school tragedies highlight this.  It's time to change the oppressive school  environment before many armed Carries recieve one taunt too many.</p></body></html>

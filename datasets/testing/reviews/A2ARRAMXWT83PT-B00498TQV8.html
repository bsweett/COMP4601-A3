It finally made it to Cherrydale Cinemas this week, and I have to say that all of the hype surrounding this film is justified. It is one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />It concerns a young girl, Ree Dolly, who lives deep within the Ozark Mountains. Day after day, she single-handedly takes care of her younger brother and sister, as well as her ill mother. On many occasions, she has to hunt for food in order to be able to feed her family. Ever so often, the neighbors help by giving the family leftovers from the night before. It is clear that this family is struggling, and that Ree is doing all that she can to provide.<br /><br />When the sheriff shows up at her doorstep and informs her that her father, a fugitive and a crystal meth dealer, has put her house up for bail bond, she has to race against all odds to find him. Everything is at stake, and so Ree sets out on a dangerous journey in order to save her family. From the time that Ree begins her journey into darkness until the shocking finale, we are driven to the edge of our seats. Not once will you take your eyes off of the screen. There are times when you want to look away, but you can't and you won't.<br /><br />The strength of this film lies in its authenticity. Most of the time, you feels as if you are watching a documentary feature, peering into the lives of these people. Everything from the performances, to the setting, to the minimalist score provides an eerie realism to the final product.<br /><br />Newcomer Jennifer Lawrence plays the part of Ree Dolly, and I should tell you that this performance is going to make her a star, possibly earn her a few nominations at awards ceremonies. She shows a confidence that many actresses lack these days. I'd put her in the same category as Ellen Page. It's a magical thing when the audience forgets that they are simply watching a performance. Ree becomes real to us because of Jennifer Lawrence's abilities as an actress.<br /><br />The same has to be said for the rest of the cast. I'm not sure how many of the actors had any experience prior to making this film, but they all shine in their respective roles. The direction from Debra Granik is simple and to the point. That's not to say that it lacks elegance, it only adds to the neo-realist vibe that the film sends out. The score is minimal, yet haunting. The cinematography is breathtaking. The cast and crew take us places that we have never been before to tell us a story that we will never forget.<br /><br />The film was adapted from the novel of the same name by Daniel Woodrell.</p></body></html>

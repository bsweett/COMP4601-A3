<meta name="summary" content="A classic that straddles several genres"></head><body><p>If you haven't seen this movie, and you can stand a bit of violence, see it.  It's one of those films that only comes around maybe once a year or every few years that entertains and grabs you.  It's moving and powerful, but not in a sentimental way.  Western, noir, (dark) comedy, action/adventure: it straddles all those genres.  It's gritty and authentic without looking low budget or cheap.  There's not a mediocre acting performance in entire film.<br /><br />I won't spoil it anything, but some of its critics hate the ending.  I'll only say that I appreciate if for no other reason that it doesn't wrap up like most films do or even in a way you would hope or expect.  Avoiding cliches while giving something with which the audience can identify is tricky business, but the Coen brothers do just that.<br /><br />I've never read the book it's based on, but some credit must go to Cormac McCarthy for giving the Coens and the screenwriting team what could only have been great source material.<br /><br />I cannot recommend it highly enough!</p></body></html>

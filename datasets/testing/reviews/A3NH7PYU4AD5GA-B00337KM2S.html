(American business talk really is marvelously innovative.) He gets to do that because the people's bosses don't have the strength of character to tell them personally, but they have enough money to pay a consultant. Outsourcing is the magic word. This kind of game is played all over the US (this land is your land... is the appropriate film music), so Bingham lives in planes and airports and hotels and rented cars and has all priority cards in the industry. His ambition in life is to become a 10 million miles flyer.<br />Things get complicated when he, Clooney, gets threatened with being `let go' himself. Or rather, his job is made more cost efficient by cutting out the traveling and the face to face meeting in favor of video conferences. Bingham has moments of weakness and imagines that his accidental lover might want a real relationship. Bad idea.<br /><br />The film is certainly not hilariously funny, how could it be with its subject, but to a cynical observer of world affairs, like me, it seems to be a fairly accurate satire on certain aspects of capitalist life and reality. Quite a bitter satire, but not less true for the bitterness. I like the movie, but it is not a great one. A nice little one.<br /><br />I recognized so many facets of my own circle of experience that I could not help but enjoy it. My lifestyle has some similarities in terms of movement, though my job involves mainly hiring people, not firing them. That means that I am a better person than Bingham. I need that kind of reassurance for my mental balance, as Clooney definitely looks better. Truth must be told.<br />On the other hand, I have also been fired three times over the last 15 years, so I can relate to this film from different angles. So why not notch my rating up to 5 stars?<br /><br />P.S. the headline should read: Do you want a can, Sir?</p></body></html>

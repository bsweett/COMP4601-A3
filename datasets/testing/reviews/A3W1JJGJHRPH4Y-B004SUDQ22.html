The acting is strong. The characters are interesting. The dialog, especially between the daughter and her father is always at multiple levels. The conversations interweave logic, math, and interpersonal concerns. My favorite part is where the Anthony's character (the father) encourages Gwenyth's character to stop moping and start working. He uses the properties of the number 1729 to good effect.<br /><br />The movie is a little slow and predictable so I knocked a star off. If you didn't have a tie into it like "math" or Chicago, I could see where it could drag. The flashbacks are supposed to be slightly confusing. She's having problems with the death of her father and her mental states. I didn't understand the criticisms of the other reviewers of the movie based on the flashbacks. Some of the confusion was intentional.<br /><br />The movie was elegant and thoughtful.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Musical for a Youthful Audience"></head><body><p>This is a musical first and foremost, make no mistake; it has beautiful scenery, an amusing story line, and lots of music and dancing. If you're into that sort of thing this may well be one you'll like.<br /><br />I would suggest you rent it before buying as it falls into a distinct genre of movie. Several younger members of our family recommended it to us and we watched it and found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of the songs. I'll admit they did enjoy it so you may well enjoy it too; just watch it first and get a feel for what you would be buying.</p></body></html>

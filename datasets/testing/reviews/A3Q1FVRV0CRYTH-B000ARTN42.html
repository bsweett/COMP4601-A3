It shows the pure human emotion that will make you stand up and cheer at the end, not just because theres an amazing triumph, but because of WHO you are watching triumph.  Crowe at his best to date stars as Braddock, a man who was once at his best and then, due to arthritis and we can't forget the depression falls flat on his face, working day jobs here and there where he can and fighting nameless fights when given the chance all just to provide for his family.  It's heart wrenching to watch Crowe give his breakfast to his hungrey daughter or to watch him beg for money from the boxing comm. with his hat in his hands.  Crowes performance is so intence and so real that it took me a bit to realize I was watching a movie.  I was actually brought to tears for Crowe and not Braddock.  As fate would have it Braddock is given a chance at redemption and he takes it...winning fight after fight until he goes up against Max Baer for the title.  The last scene is so intence, and even though we all know how it ends we can't help but cringe thinking somehting bad may happen.  This is by far the best boxing/family drama I've ever scene.  Blows 'Million Dollar Baby' out of the water, and that was something I didn't excpect.  See this movie, becasue it's worth every minute.</p></body></html>

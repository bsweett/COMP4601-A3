<meta name="summary" content="Mid Life Crisis for Dennis Quaid"></head><body><p>Dennis Quaid is one of the all- time Hollywood champions of "B" movies. He does a decent acting job in most of his films, but the movies he has starred in over the years have mostly been mediocre. It seems to be a curse that Mr. Quaid cannot escape. And "In Good Company" is no exception. It's a very average film in terms of the storyline and the direction, with some decent performances by the leads.<br /><br />The story of this film centers around Quaid's character Dan Forman and his new boss, Carter Duryea, who is played by relative newcomer Topher Grace. This new kid on the block is much younger than Dan Forman and there is tension in the air from the beginning. To add to the trauma, Carter slowly develops a love interest for Forman's daughter Alex, who is played by Scarlett Johansson. This forms the basic plot of the movie.<br /><br />There are a few morals to this story, but they are things that we have seen and heard many times before in other movies. At one point, for example, Carter realizes that playing the role of corporate executive isn't quite the fun ride he envisioned. And Quaid's character has a crisis of sorts with accepting change- both with his daughter and with his career. This forms the basis of the movie's conflicts, and it isn't very original.<br /><br />Another problem I had with this movie is that there just isn't anything very memorable about it. There are no incredibly funny moments or classic lines from the characters. It's just an ordinary film about an ordinary guy who has to learn how to cope with change.<br /><br />In Good Company is an ok film, and it makes for a pleasant enough way to spend a rainy evening at home. I didn't find anything particularly great about this film. But I cannot say that it's bad, either. It ranks right up there with most of Dennis Quaid's films: Ok, but something you will forget you ever saw in a matter of days.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A very cool Trojan War movie! Oh, and Achilles rules!"></head><body><p>I like this movie a lot. In fact, I come close to loving it. The battle scenes between the Greeks and the Trojans were super-everything from the throwing of spears to the swinging of swords to the firing of arrows to the catapulting of fireball rocks. Oh and there was plenty of blood, too(Niiiiccccceee!)Blood flying everywhere-in pints! Wicked. Achilles, by the way, was my favorite character. Brad Pitt did him superbly and Hector was in close second place, as Eric Bana played him like a dream and he showed that just as Achilles was the Greek of all Greeks, Hector was the Trojan of all  Trojans. All of this is true as far as I'm concerned. On top of that, Helen was wicked sexy and more beautiful than any woman I've seen in any movie, and King Priam was  very brave for someone who did little fighting. However, despite that, and the fact that the Trojan Horse was built very well, I did not like Paris very much. He was a coward and a wimp. But other than that, this movie rocks!</p></body></html>

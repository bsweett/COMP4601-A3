When I say this about Disney and Pixar's Up, I mean it both for how the film makes us feel as well as the way it looks. It's filled with glorious animation and spectacular colors. This is the kind of film that will inspire you to buy a Blu-Ray player, if you haven't done so already. Vibrant does it minimal justice.<br /><br />Much like Wall.e, Up is something kids will have a blast with, but will also force them to think. It's not a mindless bouncing off the walls disaster, like so may cartoons have been in the past.<br /><br />Like most great films, Up centers around a love story. Two kids meet and fall in love at a young age, due mainly to their shared common interest in being explorers. They are Carl and Ellie and we see their relationship grow and prosper and eventually turn into a wholesome marriage. This is all shown to us in what I considered to be the film's most original and touching moment. It's all done without dialogue, and is accompanied by a heartfelt score.<br /><br />Sadly, Ellie passes away and leaves Carl alone and heartbroken. They had plans together to travel to one of their favorite places: Paradise Falls. They had a jar with their life savings set aside and everything. But as is too often the case, life got in the way of their plans and with unforeseen bills and expenses, the trip was never had. In case it's not blatantly obvious, you're crying your eyes out by this point in the film.<br /><br />We see that Carl has turned into the sweetest old man imaginable, complete with a full head of white hair and a set of large, dark, square-framed eye glasses. He lost a piece of himself when Ellie died and his beloved home becomes a valuable keepsake for him to remember her by.<br /><br />When he is threatened with losing his sacred home to a rich tyrant, Carl must act fast. Having several hundreds of balloons stored in his home (which is meaningful to the story) he remedies a brilliant plan. He will take his house, with the help of those balloons and a whole lot of helium, and will fly away to Paradise Falls!<br /><br />His plan works, but he soon realizes he has unintentionally brought someone along with him; a small boy-scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai).<br /><br />The two befriend one another and embark on an incredible adventure, involving a classic villain voiced by Christopher Plummer, and several other interesting creatures. Marking it as only the second animated film to ever be nominated for an Oscar for best picture of the year; Up is sure to become a timeless classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still scary!"></head><body><p>The great thing about this movie is the fact that there is an extreme sense of paranoia. John Carpenter does a fantastic job of making it frightening but not resorting to a bunch of teen slashers. Kurt Russell does an awesome job and the film doesn't rely on the top stars in the world to get the big bucks. It is done masterfully from start to finish. Yea, it's that good.<p>Basically a lone outpost discovers a terrifying &quot;virus&quot;. This virus is interesting in that the make-up department does a really great job with it. They make it look scary and make the sense of dread even cooler. This movie is great, but &quot;the fog&quot; is still a little scarier.</p></body></html>

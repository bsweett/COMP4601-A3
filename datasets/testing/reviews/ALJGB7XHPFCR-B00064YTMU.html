Using high definition video, he creates the most realistic vision of L. A. that I have ever seen on screen. Stylistically, everything in the film is toned down to keep it as closely grounded in reality as possible. There is no slow motion, self conscious cinematography or indulgent set pieces. Mann reigns in all of these tricks to keep the audience wrapped in the story. He continues with his recurrent themes of masculinity, professionalism and skill. Cruise and Foxx are exceptional here. Both deliver stand-out performances that are unique in their restraint. While both have ample opportunity to take their characters over the top, they don't. Instead they keep with the whole tone of the film and what you do get is much more rewarding and compelling. Like Mann's other films, he relies on the complexity of the characters to tell the story and not mindless action to fill in where the writing lacks. Mann is not afraid to show you the quiet contemplative moments because he knows they will sharply contrast with the action when it comes. There is nothing overtly exceptional about the story or even the writing, although both are good. The real reward here is in the performances and the brilliant direction of Mann, who achieves even greater success with a more minimal approach.</p></body></html>

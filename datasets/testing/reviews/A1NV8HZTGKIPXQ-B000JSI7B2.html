Of course, you can't really watch this film as a complete history lesson. I'll explain later. The movie tells the story about Jack The Ripper, a name given to a serial killer who brutally slaughtered five prostitutes(could be more)nearly 114 years ago in London. Nobody knew who this man was. They still don't. In comes Johnny Depp, who plays a Scotland Yard inspector named Abberline. This is a man with his own problems. He is addicted to opium, and this addiction seems to help him solve murders by having visions of the crimes. He befriends prostitute Mary Kelly(who, in real life, was a victim)played by Heather Graham, who is part of the circle of prostitutes being killed. Isn't it funny how all of her fellow prostitutes are on the unattractive side but she is pretty?. Robbie Coltrane("Harry Potter", "Nuns On The Run")is on hand as Depp's sgt. The cast also includes Ian Holm, who you may remember from such films as "Alien" and "The Fifth Element". He plays a doctor who no longer practices because of an ailment. The Hughes Brothers(Allen and Albert), direct this film with a sure hand. It is exquisitley shot and looks great. There are a number of scenes that are filled with haunting visuals. The town and costumes are great. Beautiful. The acting is pretty solid. Heather Graham is a decent actress, but she hasn't been given any good stuff since "Boogie Nights". She is passable here, but there isn't a whole lot to her. Ian Holm steals the show with his ill doctor character. Robbie Coltrane is always watchable. Johnny Depp is pretty good. There is no doubt that he is one of the best actors of his generation, but his performance here is kinda routine. Not that it's bad. Some people say he's just like Ichabod Crane in "Sleepy Hollow" again. No way. These two movies and characters are as different as night and day. His accent is pretty good too. The ending of this film tells you who the ripper is. But don't think that you were actually given a positive answer to this mystery. You aren't. The fact is that nobody really knows who Jack The Ripper was. This crime has gone unsolved for over a 100 years. There have been theories and thoughts since then, but no real proof. He could've been caught, but he could also of gotten away. No one knows who he really was or what happened to him and probably never will. The filmmakers here pretty much took one theory and used it. But there can be no satisfactory ending here. I suggest you read some books on this subject or check out some web sites on who some of the alleged suspects were. It is a fascinating mystery made into a decent, but still somewhat unsatisfying, film. It is very violent and may not be of your liking. I enjoyed it well enough. It could of been better.</p></body></html>

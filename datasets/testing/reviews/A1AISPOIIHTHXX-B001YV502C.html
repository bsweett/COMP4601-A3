<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films of last year, period"></head><body><p>I don't think I've ever seen a movie work so great and yet be so mismanaged and marketed. With movies that become unlikely successes like the Blair Witch Project or Big Fat Greek Wedding then you see the error of how Children of Men was marketed, it feels criminal. Alfonso Cuaron's follow-up to the well-praised (even though I wasn't that over-ecstatic about it) Y Tu Mama Tambien is just an all around well-crafted film and a chilling idea about where the world could be headed.<br /><br />Set in 2027, women around the world inexplicably have become infertile and unable to bear children. To make matters worse, the youngest person in the world was killed when he refused to sign autographs. Main character and former activist Theo knows its a horrible world but he's in a kind of "oh well" state of mind. His ex Julian, who is still being an anti-government activist, comes to him with a favor: safeguard a woman named Kee. Special thing is she's 8 months pregnant and in this world, she would make a perfect bargaining tool and political stronghold so Theo has to escort Kee to the "Human Project" which will help her and the baby.<br /><br />What the film does right in presenting the future is it doesn't take the Blade Runner approach and just simply go nuts with technology. There's been some advances but there's also been some regression and England has been reduced to a graffiti-covered hellzone and in one nice on-going joke, Theo keeps trading old shoes and clothes for other ones because he has to rather than just walk into a shoe store and get a new pair. And the notion that the entire female population becomes infertile seems almost sci-fi but then you go "well, if that and that happens, you never know...".<br /><br />While it's primarily a drama, it's arguably got 2 of the best action scenes of the year and strangely, they're all in the same movie and all done in one take. One (which had to be supported with a big camera rig) takes place in a car while another has us follow Theo through the streets as everything is getting shot at left and right. What makes these work is not only do they work production-wise when you think about it (6-8 minutes at most with one mistake making you redo 8 minutes over again), but dramatically they work as well and they're not just cool camera trickeries just for the sake of showing off.<br /><br />Then of course there's the acting and our anchor is Clive Owen. To be honest, he was kind of bland in Sin City (probably because the voiceover was that way) but here he really shines, playing a troubled man and one who isn't some action-hero all of a sudden. He makes mistakes and his accomplishments are that much better. Julianne Moore plays a pivotal-but-small role as Julian while Michael Caine plays Theo's friend Jasper. He always works in every film he does but giving him an almost hippie quality doesn't gel as much. His "pull my finger" routine and weed smoking seems slightly out of place.<br /><br />While not being graced with a good cover and having some light features (a documentary on the state of the world is insightful but featurettes looking into the making-of as a whole would've given more depth would've worked) it's still a wondrous film people should definately check out.</p></body></html>

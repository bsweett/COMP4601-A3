<meta name="summary" content="Casablanca"></head><body><p>"Casablanca" is a landmark film. It's 64 years old and yet most of the dialogue is still quoted today, it's #2 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (just directly below "Citizen Kane"), and is a true masterpiece of film.<br /><br />I typically don't watch films from this era, I've never seen a film with Humphrey Bogart or Ingrid Bergman; This is not the most entertaining of several of my favorite movies that are on AFI's list below this film, nor is this the second most entertaining film ever made...But it is an important one; But that's not why I'm giving it 5 stars. The biggest thing I look for when reviewing a film in the quality of entertainment; I don't care how important the movie is, if it's kind of dull I won't rank it that high. This film is a beautiful and entertaining film; The cinematography/lighting is beautiful, the dialogue is beautiful, the acting is wonderful, the film is incredibly influential. Anyway; The movie is set against the backdrop of World War II in Casablanca and takes place mostly in a gambling/gin joint owned by Rick Blaine (Bogart), a distant kind of guy who "doesn't stick his neck out for anybody" and seems to find no enjoyment in life. He runs his gin joint and that's it. After some transfer papers are stolen (and are subsequently being looked for by the Germans) and are given to Rick, the man who gives them to him is arrested shortly after and Rick awaits the gentlemen who will pick them up. That man is Victor Laszlo, who is famous for having spent a year in a concentration camp and escaping; Also along with Laszlo is his beautiful wife Isla Lund (Bergman), who is tied to Rick's past. Back in 1942, the film won 3 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. How it lost (although I'm not sure if it was even nominated) Best Cinematography and Best Actor is beyond me. As I said, I've never seen a film with Humphrey Bogart before but the man is an amazing actor. He has this way of speaking and a way of moving that really sucks you in. Some of the dialogue (although it is great) wouldn't work coming out of other actors mouths; Here, it's perfectly fine. "Here's looking at you kid" and "I believe this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship" is classic movie dialogue that we will no doubt here for a much longer time. This isn't a movie the whole family can rent for a night of Saturday night entertainment; But for film buffs and classic film mongers, this is a film you can't miss.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic gun battles brought to you by Vincent"></head><body><p>Tom Cruise (Vincent) has complete control of his handguns in this movie. He blows away all his "targets" with style and panache. Well, he should. He's an extremely well-trained assassin, on a "night on the town" picking his victims from his notebook computer; going from place to place with Jamie Foxx as his unsolicited cab driver(?), Max.  Ahhh...Vincent shoots people and then, shoots more people. I really loved the way he put down the scumbag punks in the alley. HK USP, Glock, HK MP4, Beretta, Sig-Sauer, Uzi? Just some of the guns used in this mayhem-for-hire movie. Jada Pinkett-Smith is one of his "targets."</p></body></html>

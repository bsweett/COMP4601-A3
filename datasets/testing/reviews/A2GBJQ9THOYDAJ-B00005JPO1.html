<meta name="summary" content="Better than I expected, not as good as it might have been"></head><body><p>I have to admit, I had pretty low expectations for this fourth film in the series. I mean, with the generally high failure rate of sequels, what can you realistically expect from a fourth attempt? But I was pleasantly surprised: This one is almost as good as the first. It certainly resembles "Raiders of the Lost Ark" in various ways, both in the story line -- a race against the Bad Guys to find the secret location of a mysterious artifact that possesses occult (or at least arcane) powers -- and in its "bits of business." There's also a running fight between the Goodies and the Badies in separate vehicles racing on parallel tracks through the jungle. There's a nerve-wracking precipice. There's even a love interest in the return of Marian Ravenwood, played by Karen Allen. What's amazing is that, while Harrison Ford certainly looks older, he's still very spry for being 65 years old -- which is only a shade older than me, and I'm not even remotely in that sort of condition. Not every shot can be handled by a stunt double or faked with CGI. The period this time is 1957, roughly 18 years after the last film, in order to account for Indy (and Ford) being 18 years older himself, so the embodiment of all that is evil is now the Commies instead of the Nazis. What genre of films were peculiar to the mid-50s? Science fiction-slash-monster flicks, with invaders from Mars standing in for the other side in the Cold War. The plotline, with interdimensional instead of interplanetary visitors, plays deliberately against that. So does the entry of Henry "Mutt" Williams (played very nicely by Shia LeBoeuf) astride a Harley and looking very much like James Dean. Mutt, who is Marian's son (by, of course, Indiana Jones) develops the same tense and rebelious relationship with Indiana that Indy himself had with his own father. Wheels within wheels. The film's semi-violent action opens _in media res_ and seldom pauses for more than a minute or two. There are plenty of surprise antics (my favorite probably is Indiana popping up and blowing back through the business end of a native's blowgun, burying the poison dart in the guy's throat). The army ants are also a nice effect. I would rate this one at least as good as "The last Crusade," which means it ties for Second Place after the original film.</p></body></html>

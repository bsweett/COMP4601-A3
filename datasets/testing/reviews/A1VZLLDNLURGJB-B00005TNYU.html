<meta name="summary" content="The Goonies (1985)-Loved it in 1985 and so did my kids!"></head><body><p>The Goonies (1985) was a five star film experience for me and my two young boys back in 1985 when we first saw it in the theater. Now that over 20 years have gone by and my boys are grown, I occasionally watch it on DVD and in retrospect, I am a little surprised at some of the lines. I know this film is a cult movie and it probably deserves it, but really didn't see the need for some of the language, like "Oh Sh-t" from Chunk, and so on.<br /><br />My kids really enjoyed this film and wound up being "influenced" by the flick in a few ways.  My wife and I bought a pirates map on fake parchment for them which we had framed and placed in their room which we called a Goonies Map.  For a period, my younger boy was interested in pirates, pirate ships and coins, and the family even wound up staying at Pirates Cove (a hotel which featured a full size pirates ship) on a trip indirectly because of this darn film.<br /><br />That being said, when I screen this old movie with subtitles on I am surprised at some of the things the Goonies say in the course of the entertaining racket. Just an observation, that's all. All in all, a great film and I would still vote it five full stars.</p></body></html>

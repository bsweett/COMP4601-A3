<meta name="summary" content="Could have been so much better!"></head><body><p>Spartan was a big disappointment, though I should have known something was wrong when none of the copies at the video club had been rented out (...and here I was thinking myself lucky!).<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a lousy job of portraying a secret service agent on a mission to rescue the president's daughter from slavers.<br /><br />The potential for a good movie was definitely there, but the surprisingly poor acting/casting and the full of holes plot prevented it from becoming anything more than a flop.  As other reviewers have pointed out, what were the director and producer thinking?  But more importantly, what was Val Kilmer thinking?  Was he so desperate for a role that he didn't object to this travesty?<br /><br />Do not expect anything like Top Gun, Willow, or the Saint here.<br /><br />As for the connection with glorious Sparta (title) it is rather an unfortunate parallel bordering on ludicrous.<br /><br />Overall, both Val Kilmer as well as the rest of the "cast" do a rather poor job of trying to cover up for the mediocre plot; wait `til Spartan is shown on TV.</p></body></html>

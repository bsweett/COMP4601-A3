They both also sport fine performances by the entire cast, Viggo Mortensen delivering career bests in both films.  Speaking of Viggo, I personally took a while to appreciate what he did with his character in `A History of Violence', a film that I adored but a performance that I couldn't rally behind.  After watching the film a few times though I have grown to understand why he was praised so much for his performance.  His turn in `Eastern Promises' took me no such time to understand and support.  As Nikolai he commands every scene with his restrained dominance.  We'll get back to him in a minute.<br /><br />Another similarity to the aforementioned `Violence' is that both films are more a study how violence either effects out actions or dominates our thinking.  Both films are violent in scenes but subdued in most, delving into the way violence circles the mind as apposed to the body.  It's within scenes where mobster Semyon fingers the mere idea of committing a heinous crime that we see the true reality of `Eastern Promises'.  This is a world where violence is entertained on a whim and is used to solve any problem.<br /><br />The one main issue I have with this film is one of the things that has been lauded by many reviewers and critics; the script.  It's just not as impressive as I had anticipated.  There are a few holes I noticed throughout, things that just made no sense (like how the baby born in the opening scenes to a mother who was injected with heroine every day had absolutely no health problems) and it was these things that made me lose some of my admiration for the film.  Cronenberg directs the film masterfully, using the same sense of restrained rage he displayed in `Violence' and the cinematography is near perfect, but it's that pesky script that bothered me to no end while the film was running.  Steven Knight's screenplay just needed to undergo a massive tweaking.<br /><br />The performances are another story all together.  Naomi Watts (in a truly `supporting' performance) delivers warmth and courage and makes her character relatable to the audience.  We understand her values and viewpoints, and hopefully we agree with them.  Jerzy Skolimowski plays Stepan with a beautiful humanistic sense of loyalty and parental responsibility.  The mobster family is also portrayed masterfully.  Vincent Cassel is not an actor I'm usually impressed with, but here he adapts to his character well, and while his final scene is not entirely believable he manages to muster enough charisma beforehand to make it forgivable.  Armin Mueller-Stahl on the other hand is magnificent throughout, truly understanding Semyon and portraying him masterfully.  He creates layers around this man that peel away as his true intentions and personality comes to the fore.<br /><br />They all though play second fiddle to Mortensen's brilliant performance.  With every line he draws the audience further into his character, making Nikolai someone we want to know more about.  Much like Crowe's ravishing performance in `3:10 to Yuma', Mortensen says so much without really saying much at all.  He acts with every muscle in his face, letting us into his heart and soul with a glance in our direction.<br /><br />In the end `Eastern Promises' is a film I highly recommend.  It's not perfect, and it's somewhat of a step down from `A History of Violence', but it manages to deliver enough good to outweigh the bad.</p></body></html>

Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy; Cristina Applegate plays Veronica Corningstone, the newcomer on the block with a strong willed desire to be an anchor herself. Farrell, especially being the male chauvinist as he is, sees Corningstone's arrival as yet another chance to have himself a conquest. Corningstone, predictably in this type of plot, wants no part in an office romance. Worse yet for Ron Burgundy and his male buddies on the news show: newcomer Veronica Corningstone actually knows something about journalism!<br /><br />There are numerous funny moments in this movie here on DVD. There's of course the gang warfare between five (count 'em, five) separate news channels that's really well done. Another scene worth mention is the scene with Ron's dog that despite being a bit troubling is actually hysterical. There's Steve Carrell as the weatherman with a questionable IQ level who refers to the state of Iowa as "the Middle East."  Moreover, there are some great cameos by such pros as Tim Robbins, Danny Trejo and Ben Stiller.<br /><br />While watching this movie you get the sense that the actors really wanted to do it to showcase their talents and just plain have fun making a fun movie. My advice is not to go into this comedy expecting it to be literally flawless. Instead, this comedy flick is perfect for the person who wants to enjoy some laughs and funny situations while relaxing their brain and not worrying about following a complicated plot. Yes, I know, there's the subplot theme of the 70's feminist movement, but without any doubt this takes a back seat to the comedy.<br /><br />The DVD comes with great extras that increase its value. Extras include the "Making of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," bloopers and deleted scenes, and (of course) the "Ron Burgundy A&E Biography." Sound and picture quality are very good.<br /><br />I would encourage you to get this DVD: the movie itself is very good for a fun time! Fans of Farrell and the Saturday Night Live style of comedy are going to be especially pleased with the way they made this DVD! The extras make it all the more worthwhile.</p></body></html>

Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lector is simply spine-tingling and compelling. I can't fathom anyone else playing the role of our favorite cannibal. I get goosebumps when mentions about eating fava beans with a glass of chianti. I still get creeped out when Hannibal escapes from that makeshift jail. That scene outgrosses any scene in any given modern day horror movie. In fact I can't really watch the moment Hannibal escapes without covering my eyes. Jodie Foster is awesome in her portray of Clarice Sterling. I like how her character handles herself while amidst a group of male cops at a funeral. You rarely see a female role in movies where she doesn't take any kind of (nonsense)from male authority. Clarice Sterling is one of those rare characters. In conclusion, there isn't a movie like "Silence of the Lambs" that can stand the test of time and remain one of the scariest and intense films.</p></body></html>

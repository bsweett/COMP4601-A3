Ultimately, it falls short of that and lands right in the run of the mill pile.<br /><br />ULTRAVIOLET is NOT a waste of time. It has some phenominal technical moments. Not to mention, some very cool and memorable fight scenes and special effects. Milla Jovovich looks very believable wielding swords and battling hords of attackers. She's also very cool and gives a solid performance. In fact, the entire mood is engaging.<br /><br />So, where does Ultraviolet fall short? There are many things, but I believe the most important thing is that the movie plays like a VIDEO GAME STORY.<br /><br />You may say, "It's supposed to. It's a video game movie." But, turning a video game into a movie is a chance to give a different dimension to a video game character. Video game stories are usually very one dimensional. Find bad guy after fighting through hords and levels of his henchmen and eventually destroy him. That is exactly what you get... the movie plays like levels... and if you've ever heard the term "Hack and Slash". That is what the movie is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I love the action. I love the battle scenes. But, it just seems to be one after the other. One immense battle scene after the next, and when it's all said and done.... there wasn't much of a story to be told... just like a video game.<br /><br />Another thing that bugged me was the beginning... the movie has to explain the world... the virus... the new species... the side effects... the war that is raging... and then I noticed... WE'RE ALREADY 10 minutes into the movie!!  Dear lord! Tighten this script up man! Movies should grab you in the first 5 minutes. And then, after the 10 minute explanation... you're thinking, "Is this the second coming of DUNE? Is the movie gonna be that complicated?" And as I've already said... it isn't.<br /><br />This needed more side stories. More emotion. More character building. More essence, more dread and less Milla Jovovich taking on 30 bad guys at a time... 7 or 8 times... or maybe it was more than that. However many it was, it felt like watching SOMEBODY ELSE play a video game after the 2nd time.<br /><br />Maybe it would have been more fun had you been able to control the action with a controller... but ultimately, ULTRAVIOLET sort of falls flat. It's a cool looking movie with a very hip Milla Jovovich giving it her all, but with a very one dimensional story that leaves you with an unfulfilled taste in your mouth when it's all said and done.</p></body></html>

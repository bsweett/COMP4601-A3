<meta name="summary" content="Black and White is so much creepier!"></head><body><p>If you are going to buy this movie make sure you get the blu ray so that you get the black and white version of the movie, it makes it so much better, that is if you like B&W movies. Also if you are a fan of Stephen Kings movies check out the blu ray version of 1408, the ending is totally different than the DVD version and alot scarier.</p></body></html>

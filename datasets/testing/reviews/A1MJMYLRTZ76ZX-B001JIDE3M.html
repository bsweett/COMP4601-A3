<meta name="summary" content="A brief comment"></head><body><p>Please note that I watched this on my LCD TV on the HBO channel so I can't speak to the quality of the 3D, but after reading several of the reviewers here who know something about it, it looks like I didn't miss anything since they say the polarized 3D method that was used wasn't that good.<br /><br />But I thought the movie itself was great for the spectacular special effects. Some are eerily beautiful, like the phosphorescent pools and the luminescent birds. The CGI animation, such as in the chase with the tyranosaurus, is also outstanding. The movie only loosely sticks to the original book, but then most people don't know the original book anyway. (I don't either, I only read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, which is the more popular of the two books).<br /><br />By the way, a little trivia here, Verne originally got started writing westerns, only set in South America, oddly enough, but later turned to writing sci-fi, which is what he's best known for.<br /><br />The acting is also fine and Brendan Fraser projects a sort of goofy benevolence and exasperatedness which gives him an engaging on-screen presence--actually very similar to Cary Grant in many of his movies. He'll probably never be considered a truly great actor like Grant because of the movies he's been in, but he brings something to his roles that perhaps no one else but Grant did.<br /><br />So overall a fun CGI and special effects filled romp that, while nothing profound, is still worth watching for the stunning visuals and also suitable for the whole family.</p></body></html>

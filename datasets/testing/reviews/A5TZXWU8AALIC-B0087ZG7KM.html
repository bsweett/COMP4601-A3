<meta name="summary" content="I'm A Guy...And I Loved This Movie"></head><body><p>Finally, I've seen something that stars Kristen Wiig and wasn't a complete disappointment.<br /><br />I loved her on "Saturday Night Live" and I'm always amazed at how talented she is.  In BRIDESMAIDS, she not only stars but also shares writing credit...which is another reason I enjoyed this movie so much:<br /><br />Only a woman would have written this.<br /><br />As crude as BRIDESMAIDS sometimes is, rivaling male-oriented gross-out comedies like THE HANGOVER and such, this is still a story that only a woman would write.  My case in point: the scene where Kristen feels the need to keep snatching the microphone from best friend Maya Rudolph's rich soon-to-be sister-in-law.  The need to assert just how much these girls love and respect and care about Maya...only a woman would have written that.  Guys wouldn't understand how much that means to a woman.  Male writers would've just come up with schtick to embarass the girls.<br /><br />So BRIDESMAIDS ends up being a fairly interesting insight into women and how they think.<br /><br />It's also really funny!</p></body></html>

In Joon-ho Bong's The Host we have a similar scenario with an unusual monster terrorising locals along the Han River. This quickly became South Korea's most successful box-office hit, promising not just horror but a slice of drama with a rich topping of comedy, but how does it fare as a whole?<br /><br />The film begins with an American doctor informing his concerned Korean assistant to pour hundreds of bottles of formaldehyde down the sink which eventually drains into the Han River. Two fishermen later find a small but very strange creature in the water which they release without a second thought. Moving to the present we witness a man commit suicide by jumping off a bridge into the Han River but not before spotting something dark in the water. Curious locals soon spot something unusual hanging from the bridge and when it jumps into the river and comes towards them the city is soon being terrorised. Although the creature kills hundreds and leads to the army and emergency services being sent in to deal with it, the primary focus of The Host is on one family. Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) runs a riverside shack with his father Hee-bong (Byeon Hee-bong) and the family is left devastated when Gang-du's daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-seong) is seemingly killed by the creature. When she later contacts her father, Gang-du gathers his father and siblings in defying the authorities and leading a perilous mission to rescue Hyun-seo.<br /><br />That may have sounded quite serious until the latter stages and in many respects this is how The Host works. The creature is your typical, everyday monster, moving fast, devouring people, having a long tongue and growling a lot. Everyone seems helpless as it continues to terrorise the city though Gang-du and an American tourist do their best by hurling whatever they can get their hands on at it! When the American is wounded and later dies it leads to the US insisting they send their own forces to deal with the crisis as the South Korean government clearly has no idea what it's doing. These developments are merely in the background as we live through this disaster with Gang-du and his family. In the aftermath of the creature's first attack the family are reunited at a shelter for survivors and we get an amusing insight into their characters. While Gang-du suffers from chronic bouts of sleepiness, he is still a devoted but flawed father to Hyun-seo. Hee-bong tolerates his son's laziness and defends him against his other two children, both who also have their negative characteristics. Nam-joo (Bae Doona) is an archer that competed at the Olympics but is let down by her hesitation and slow reactions, evident in a brilliant moment when the family make a desperate getaway in a van and Nam-joo is almost left behind as she reacts too slowly and has to be dragged into the van by her brother! Finally there is Nam-il (Park Hae-il) who is a former activist and graduate who has done little with his life and laments the sorry state of South Korea. This seemingly inept family are our heroes for the duration and we are left to rely on them to take down the monster, something they seem far from capable of!<br /><br />The Host combines humour and drama very well. When Gang-du and his family are first reunited there is much arguing, pushing and shoving, before a group hug and later more pushing which leads to the quartet falling over in a heap. After being detained by the authorities, Gang-du is contacted by his daughter and his family band together to rescue her. Hee-bong ends up using most of his savings to orchestrate the family's escape and to obtain some weapons from what looked like members of the criminal underworld, but these are desperate times so it's perfectly understandable! While Gang-du and his family continue their search the film often switches to Hyun-seo who is trapped in the sewers close to the Han River where the creature brings victim after victim to be left for a grand feast later. Hyun-seo has to pretend to be dead whenever the creature pops back to its lair but all the time she is trying to find a way to escape.<br /><br />The Host isn't to be taken seriously and it's a lot of fun especially in the grand finale. Gang-du goes into battle with the creature armed with a street sign, Nam-il takes up some Molotov cocktails while Nam-joo is armed with her bow but so slow and hesitant is she that the creature often has time to push her out of the way. You won't know whether to be worried or just amused. Despite the laughs The Host has a surprisingly sad ending which I didn't see coming. There are no fanciful ways of defeating the creature in the end either, no cheap tricks just sheer determination from Gang-du and his family.<br /><br />As a monster film The Host ticks many of the right boxes for entertainment. This is not a perfect film, it's downright silly in places, and is unlikely to frighten you either given one of its tags as a horror film. However, if you have a sense of humour this is certainly worth considering.</p></body></html>

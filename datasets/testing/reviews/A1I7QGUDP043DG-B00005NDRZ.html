<meta name="summary" content="Favorite horror classics"></head><body><p>This is one of my favorite horror/suspense movies of all time. I recall that when I watched it when it first came out and I was younger, Duvall's character 'Wendy' irritated me so much I was begging Jack to 'give her the axe' (I know, what a thing to say). Watching it at an older age, her character doesn't irritate me for some reason. Jack Nicholson's antics always amaze me and I never seem to tire of them. I was surprised to learn in some trivia that Stephen King wasn't happy at first when he was chosen for the role.<br /><br />When an alcoholic on the wagon agrees to isolate himself and his family by taking a winter caretaker position at a large Colorado hotel, it seems like the perfect job, especially for an aspiring writer who hopes to finish his novel. Then old ghosts hatch a plan to tear down the serenity of the lodge and replace it with their haunted past. This movie will still keep viewers on their toes, despite having been filmed in the eighties when many advances in special effects hadn't been made. 'The Shining' is so character driven that it really didn't need all the cinematic tricks. I really miss director Stanley Kubrick and his magic.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

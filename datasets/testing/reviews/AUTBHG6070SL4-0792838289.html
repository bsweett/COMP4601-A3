International communism loomed as the evil empire of the day, represented by the USSR, China, and North Korea in collusion. The idea of mind control also fascinated that time, psychiatry and brain-washing being two of its forms. All of these pieces come together in a suspenseful script: the lead character has been brain-washed as an obedient assassin, and further brainwashed so he doesn't know it himself.<br /><br />TMC's plot builds well, with a few startling turns of script. Almost anything I could say would be a spoiler, so I must be a little vague here. One thing to watch for, though is the irony of the McCarthy character - the scriptwriter found the cleverest possible way to motivate that divisive, destructive character. Another point to watch is in the climactic scene, where the assassin loads the gun meant to kill one crucial man with one shot - count the bullets as he loads the gun.<br /><br />The acting and the style of the movie look a little dated now, especially the fight scenes. All that is in keeping with the time in which TMC was made and the time it portrays. It's a well-made film, one of President Kennedy's favorites, and a strange foretelling of Kennedy's death soon after it was released.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

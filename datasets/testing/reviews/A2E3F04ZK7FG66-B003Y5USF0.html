<meta name="summary" content="Don't expect "Gone With the Wind""></head><body><p>This film is not high cinematic art. It was intended to be a summer blockbuster "put your brain on hold" action film when it was released in 1996, and that is what it was and still is. Its competition at the time was "Independence Day", which is an unwatchably hokey movie, and this movie is better than that film in that it is a watchably hokey movie. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play recently divorced storm chasers Jo and Bill Harding whose relationship was pulled apart by Jo's obsession with chasing tornadoes to the exclusion of wanting any kind of "normal family life" by Bill's definition. Bill has moved on and found a more conventional girl that he plans to marry (Jami Gertz). However, before he can move on, Bill needs Jo to sign some papers. He meets her "in the field" as she and her team from the university plan a day of chasing tornadoes through Oklahoma. Before they can conclude their business a storm calls the team to the chase, and Bill is drawn into the chase by necessity but kept there by his latent passion - for storm-chasing and maybe even for the marriage he left behind. The film features some great special effects, fast-paced action, and cringingly obvious dialogue with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. However if you're just in the mood for an action-packed film with a feel-good after effect, this movie fits the bill.<br /><br />A popular internet film database ranks this film as 5.9 out of 10. That is probably correct if you are comparing it with Casablanca. If you judge it as an action film against other action films, I'd say it's probably more of a 7 out of 10. The following are the special features:<br /><br />Disc 1<br />* Commentary by Jan DeBont and Stefan Fangmeier<br />* Theatrical Trailers<br /><br />Disc 2<br />* Chasing the Storm: Twister Revisited<br />* The Making of Twister [HBO First Look Special]<br />* Anatomy of a Twister<br />* Nature Tech: Tornadoes [2003 History Channel special]<br />* Van Halen Humans Being Music Video</p></body></html>

As time passes the three friends drift apart, but are unexpectedly reunited after Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum)is murdered. Sean is now a police detective and is assigned to head the investigation along with his partner Whitey Powers ( Laurence Fishburne). The main suspect in the murder is Jimmy and Shawn's friend Dave, because he came home the night of the murder covered in blood spinning a half baked story about being attacked by mugger. However, as the film progresses, the question of Dave's guilt comes more and more into question. Now it is up to Shawn to find the murderer and to keep Jimmy from gaining revenge for his daughter's death.<p>In my opinion, Mystic River is the best film of 2003. I was literally blown away at how good this film turned out to be. Clint Eastwood shows once again that he is an amazing director. Mystic River is definately his best film since Unforgiven. The reason Mystic River is so great, is because the mystery of the killer is extremely well done. Tim Robbins did an excellent job as Dave and deserved his academy award for best supporting actor. His actions throughout the film are extremely questionable, but you are never quite sure if he is the killer. When the killer is finally revealed, it will shock you. Sean Penn gave one of the best performances I have seen in a while. His character Jimmy is a hardened ex-con who is attempting to lead an honest life. But the murder of his daughter pushes him towards his old lifestyle. Penn's performance was filled with emotion and intensity. The scene where he learns about his daughter's death will blow you away. Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney are all great in their roles as well.<p>Mystic River is a well thought out and emotional murder mystery. The entire cast is phenomenal, and the ending is extremely satisfying. It is a shame that Mystic River did not beat Return of the King for best picture, because even though Return of the King was a good movie, I personally thought that Mystic River was a better film.<p>A solid 5 stars...</p></body></html>

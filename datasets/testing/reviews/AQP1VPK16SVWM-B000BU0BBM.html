<meta name="summary" content="A Grimm Gilliam fairy tale"></head><body><p>The Brothers Grimm promised to be a well of Gilliam inspired anarchy and creativity for fans of the film director. While it doesn't quie fulfill on that promise, "The Brothers Grimm" is still entertaining Gilliam even if it doesn't compare to "Brazil" or "The Fisher King" (or even "Time Bandits"). There's enough of Gilliam's inspired lunacy in the film to make it worthwhile. I, for one, hope it's a financial hit just so Gilliam can get financing for his next feature film.<br /><br />The plot postulates that the Brothers Grimm (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) are con artists using folklore and superstition to make a living from ignorant peasants. When the Grimms are caught by the authorities they're given a choice; help the authorities unmask similar con artists who are kidnapping girls from a village or be executed. Needless to say, they decide to cooperate. What the Grimms find, though, is hardly a con men trying to bilk pheasants for their money.<br /><br />While the Ehren Kruger ("The Ring","The Ring 2", Skeleton Key") script doesn't take the opportunity to develop the characters or the situations to their full potential and the film's editing feels choppy during the first hour of the film, there's still much to be appreciated and enjoyed in Gilliam's film. The film felt like it could also have been trimmed in the middle where the pacing lags a bit.<br /><br />As usual the production design is top notch and the feel of the countryside authentic right down to the crippled solider asking for money in the town square. The cinematography by Dario Marianelli compliments Gilliam's work even though this was a marriage of convenience. Although hardly perfect, "The Brothers Grimm" is still a solid adventure for Gilliam's fans. Whatever flaws prevent the film from being perfect can easily be overlooked.<br /><br />Damon demonstrates a surprisingly nice comic touch as Will Grimm. Ledger plays Jacob as a shy academic type which doesn't always quite work (there were times I thought that Jacob might have nervous tics and some sort of neurological issues). Nevertheless, the two demonstrate nice onscreen chemistry. The rest of the cast from the Gilliam regular Jonathan Pryce (in another of his performances as a military buearucrat reimiscent of the character he played in "Baron Munchausen" --which is ironic given his first Gilliam collaboration in "Brazil")to Peter Stormare in a gloriously over-the-top performance as Calvadi pull off their roles admirably. Lena Headey portrays Angelika as a steely, determined young woman who has emotionally walled herself off from the town she lives in and has no real use for the Grimm brothers until she realizes that they might actually be something more than charlatans.<br /><br />While this might not be the blockbuster that many were hoping for, it's an enjoyable ride. I found that while I was a bit disappointed in the overall effort, it's clear that Gilliam (as usual) put his heart and soul into the effort.</p></body></html>

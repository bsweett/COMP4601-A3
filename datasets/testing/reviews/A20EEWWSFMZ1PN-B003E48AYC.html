<meta name="summary" content="No doubt about it this is Disneyated not Depp"></head><body><p>This is a story about a brat (Mairi Ella Challen) that grew up to a demure young lady (Mia Wasikowska), and lost her snot factor. Can she gain it back through adventure?  The story needed some adjustment due to the age factor of the victim. So this is why we get a more of a return the Underland in place of the original Wonderland. The wit is replaces with action, the cunning with swordplay and so forth.<br /><br />I do not want to give away any surprises but this presentation is a unique made for the actors and to be politically correct for this day and age. Alice is facing marriage to the son of her defunct father's old business partner.  She has been having problem with being distracted by a rabbit in a waistcoat.  She falls for the rabbit and we began to think back fondly of the story we were told as children.  If she can adjust her size the adventure takes a sad turn into a swashbuckler; unfortunately it is Alice not The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Will Alice be eaten, scratched, beheaded, or otherwise dispatched? Or will she return, get married, and realize there is no place like home.<br /><br />I only saw the 2D version so I cannot comment on 3D. The parts were extremely well acted by many of the best known actors of the time. No telling what the movie would be if the characters were a tad more traditional.</p></body></html>

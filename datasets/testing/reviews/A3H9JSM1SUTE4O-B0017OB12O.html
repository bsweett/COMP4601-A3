He once famously said, "I only feel alive when I'm making a movie."  In The Bridge on the River Kwai Lean imprisons us in a lush landscape and forces us an to put our minds to a task that will give us some relief from the harsh reality of being a POW constructing the Burma Railway.  Controversial to many as a condemnation of a British character flaw of "doing one's duty and being happy in your work."  The same notion was also reflected in the Nuremburg Trials.  This taut story by Pierre Boulle also offered a final moment of redemption - however posthumous. But that's the hell of war.  See William Holden, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, and Sessue Hayakawa are at their best.</p></body></html>

It is fascinating that John Wayne was at his best when he stepped out of his classic 'good guy' image.  This is true of all his truly great movies whether it be 'The Searchers', 'True Grit', or his almost perfect, 'The Shootist.'  Wayne was an actor acutely concerned about his image and I would love to know how he personally felt about roles in which he played flawed, complex characters.<br /><br />This movie seems to be a compilation of historical information and novelistic interpretation.  Cynthia Parker was actually kidnapped by the Comanche and was only 'liberated' after 24 years.  She had married and gave birth to Quanah Parker who became the Comanche's greatest warchief.  This is only the bare bones of stories played out multiple times in the land that would become America.  Settlers on the frontier are the victims of lightening raids by hostile war parties.  All seems to be well when suddenly someone is crashing in your door.  Families were slowly tortured and murdered...all to the amusement of the warriors.  Children and women were sometimes taken captive.  The children were oftentimes raised as their own by the tribe.  Women captured were, generally speaking, regarded as the mutual property of the war party, and, in the vast majority of cases, the victims of mass rape.  On arriving at the village, the raped women became the sole property of the capturing warrior and, again in most cases, was used as a slave for both work and sex.<br /><br />This is the context of the attitudes that the John Wayne character expresses so well.  People living on the frontier lived in almost constant horrific fear...and hatred.  For those who actually visit the scenes of the torture, rape and murder of friends and relatives the hatred could become consuming...as it nearly consumes Wayne's character.  This is perhaps difficult to understand in these politically correct times but, let me suggest that those who condemn these attitudes search their own hearts, as well.  For us, these things are primarily historical and bear no more relationship to us than, let's say, stories of a massacre in far off Africa or Asia, 500 years ago.  At one time, however, the danger was personal and, you, me and virtually everyone else, had we lived under the danger of a scalping knife, would have felt very differently.<br /><br />This is not to justify the destruction of the native americans but it is to place it in a personal context, without which the destruction seems not only wrong but nonsensical.  The Wayne character is idiosyncratic and prejudiced.  He has survived a long war and refused to sign the Yankee 'Loyalty Oath'.  He returns home three years after the War and, at one point, gives the child Debbie a military decoration...probably Maximillian/Mexican...as a bauble, so we suspect that Wayne didn't give up the fight in 1865 but only moved it to Mexico.  He also knows a lot about the Plains Indians and even speaks Comanche....but it doesn't make him love them.<br /><br />Wayne's brother's family is slaughtered by the Comanche...and he views the horrific scene with grim hatred.  Two girls...one in her late teens and the other, Debbie, a child...have been carried off by the war party.  Wayne and others pursue.  Wayne, by himself, discovers the body of the older girl...raped and mutilated...and covers her with his Confederate great coat and 'I buried her with my own hands', he tells the others in his grim but harrowing grief.<br /><br />The search for little Debbie goes on literally for years and, when Wayne discovers that she has 'been with a buck', and been thereby contaminated, his search becomes that of a strange vengeance.  Debbie has been turned into one of the hated Comanche and must die.  On attacking the village in which Debbie is kept, Wayne, true to himself, scalps 'Scar' the chief who is keeping Debbie as a wife.  The last scenes of the movie are of both Debbie's and Wayne's redemption.  A great movie.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels...'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'...on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

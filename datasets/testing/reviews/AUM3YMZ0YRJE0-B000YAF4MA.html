<meta name="summary" content="meaningful journey film with great acting and wit"></head><body><p>I don't normally pick comedies, but was very happily surprised by this one.  Two guys bond while sharing a hospital room, sharing terminal cancer.  There is real chemistry between them, a give and take by two men who have virtually nothing in common.  One is a hard-nosed businessman, the other a mechanic with a wonderful self-taught mind.<br /><br />The plot revolves about a list of things they want to do before their time is up.  Nicolson is rich, so he invites Freeman on a tour of the world, where they skydive, attempt to trek in the Himalayas, and stay in exotic locales, crossing things off the list as more and more is revealed about the characters' lives.  They change each other and then make major steps in their lives.<br /><br />Sure, this is a tried and true formula, but these actors pull it off with true originality and excellence.  I laughed, was moved, and delighted in the philosophy of life that emerges through the journey of the film.  It is genuinely beautiful and very fun.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

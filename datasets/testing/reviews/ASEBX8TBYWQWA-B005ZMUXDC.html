It's "interesting" that the DELUXE FOUR-DVD set (DVD+ Digital+Blu-ray+ Blu-ray 3D) is priced at $49.99 and not an even $50.<br /><br />Anyway, there are MANY reviews already posted based on the theatrical version of the film so I won't re-hash the plot here. You probably will be more interested in the home version of the film.<br /><br />As noted above, there is the 4-disc Deluxe version, but Disney has also released a 2-discv version without the 3-D disc, and a single-disc DVD version. Unless you are one of the few with a 3D TV the Deluxe version probably won't be of much use.<br /><br />To date I still haven't gone Blu-ray so I was unable to watch the bonus features exclusive to BR, which include A "Making of", Deleted scenes and two extended songs. The other two minor bonuses are on the standard DVD version. These are two interesting "original storybook openings" - running just over 3 minutes each - and a two-minute "countdown" compilation of the 50 animated features - to a soundtrack of Stevie Nicks' "Dreams" - with no identification of each film.<br /><br />I've watched the film on my standard large screen TV and its really sharp. The computer animation gets better and better. And the sound on the standard DVD was perfect too!<br /><br />As for the film itself, I liked it though I don't think its Disney's best. The songs by Alan Menken sound more like they were written for a Broadway show then for the films he previously composed for.<br /><br />So, yes I enjoyed it. And would recommend. I just wish that Disney would provide those people with standard DVD players some of the bounues that is only on the BR disc. After all,  many of these do not use the BD component.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

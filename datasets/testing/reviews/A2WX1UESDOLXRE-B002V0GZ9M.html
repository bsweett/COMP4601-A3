<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Story, Very Well Written"></head><body><p>Of course the movie is well written. It'd be disappointing if a Pulitzer winning writer couldn't pen a decent film. The written word is brought to life by Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, two people who have a quiet and mesmerizing way of delivering their lines. You feel like you're part of something truly magical (to not sound completely corny!) because the premise of the movie is itself shrouded in mysticism. How is it that the little flag of the mailbox moves up and down by itself? Or that the two main characters have the same dog? And with the lakehouse as the backdrop, well, you can't beat that.<br /><br />Bullock plays Kate, a woman living in 2006, who has just begun a new job and moved out of the lakehouse into an apartment. She leaves a letter at the lakehouse for the new tennant. But who should receive this letter other than Alex, a man who is living in the lakehouse in 2004. They begin a letter-writing courtship, questioning the possibilities of how something so strange and wonderful can be happening and whether or not they can manipulate time in order for them to one day be together. While it seems easy enough (all she has to do is tell him to meet her in two years at so and so location), time and circumstances are not always on their side.<br /><br />The big question is will they or won't they, and of course, I cannot reveal this. What kind of reviewer would I be?! All I can say is that lovers of romantic comedies should not miss out, nor should fans of the written word. It's important to forget the space/time paradoxes and simply enjoy the movie, which is certainly not hard to do at all. Bullock and Reeves make that extremely easy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="BEAUTIFUL DVD, CLASSIC FILM NOIR"></head><body><p>A classic fabled film from 1941, this story set in San Francisco in the office of Archer and Spade is movie making at it's best. The actors give uniformly great performances and almost eerily seem to be born for their  parts: Bogie as Sam Spade; Jerome Cowan as Archer; Greenstreet as Gutman;  Elisha Cook as Wilmer; Lee Patrick as Effie and, of course, Peter Lorre as  Cairo. Mary Astor briefly revived her fading career (a 1936 red-hot scandal  was mostly to blame) and as Brigid O' Shaughnessy she's in her element as  the pathological liar; hers is a classic performance. Strangely, this is  actually the THIRD filmization of the Dashiell Hammett novel, the others  being a 1931 version with Bebe Daniels and Ricardo Cortez (in all fairness,  it was adequate) and the poor SATAN MET A LADY,a bizarre 1936 version with  Bette Davis (!) and the mealy Warren William.</p></body></html>

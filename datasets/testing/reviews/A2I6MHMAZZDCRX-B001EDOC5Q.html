<meta name="summary" content="A Rare Film Better Than the Book"></head><body><p>In the centuries since we were last in Narnia, things have changed.  The Telmarines have overrun the country, sending the real Narnias (you know, the talking animals and mythological creatures) into hiding.  The country is currently under the rule of King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) until his nephew, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) is old enough.  But on the night that Miraz's son is born, Caspian flees and goes into hiding.  In great danger, he blows the ancient horn of help.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in our world, only a year has passed for Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley).  They are waiting for a train when they are suddenly called somewhere else.  At first, they don't realize where they are, but it doesn't take long for them to realize they are once again in Narnia.  Only years have past since their first visit since the castle around them in is ruins.<br /><br />When they learn of the plight of the true Narnias and Caspian, they set out to join forces and free the country.  But with Aslan (voiced again by Liam Neeson) long gone, what can four children and a prince do?<br /><br />Let's get the obvious out of the way first.  They royally changed the story here.  And as someone who has never been fond of this book in the series, I will say that many of the changes were for the better.  They cut much of the first half of the book, which is the slowest part of the story.  They made the battles (yes, they added one) more epic.<br /><br />But not all the changes were beneficial.  The movie felt more like a retread of the first, something I've never felt before.  Peter here is moody and touchy, not the leader he is.  That sub-plot and the theme of faith vs. reason and power are never fully developed but glossed over for the battle sequences.  And let's not forget the romantic sub-plot that felt forced but harmless to me.<br /><br />There is one major change I thought I wouldn't like.  It expands on a scene from the book and sends the characters further down a path of darkness.  Some will find it scary and upsetting, but I think it worked and was one of the better examples of the theme.<br /><br />For anyone disappointed by the battles in the first movie, you'll be happy to hear this one makes up for it.  The battles are epic and gorgeously choreographed.  Couple those with the wonderful special effects we have become spoiled with, and you've got a great feast for the eyes.<br /><br />But I digress.  I was discussing the book versus the movie. I reread parts of the book after I saw the movie.  Yes, they changed the story, but they also include some great lines from the book.  Ultimately, they made a good movie. Even with the changes, the movie never overcomes the fact that the story is essentially straight forward and weak.  But I like this version better than the book.  (Is an avid reader allowed to admit that?)<br /><br />Having made that confession, I will list my biggest disappointment.  Trumpkin the Dwarf (Peter Dinklage) and Reepicheep the Mouse (voiced by Eddie Izzard) are not given enough time to develop here.  What is here is wonderful.  But these two characters are one of the redeeming features of the book for me, so I wanted to see more.<br /><br />Ultimately, I really did enjoy this film.  I was drawn into the world, the characters, and their struggle.  I laughed multiple times and was moved to tears as well. It was a great escape film with some good themes to think about later.</p></body></html>

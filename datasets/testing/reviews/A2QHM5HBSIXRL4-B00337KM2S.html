<meta name="summary" content="Rarely has a film so incisively and painfully captured the spirit of the moment"></head><body><p>I thought Jason Reitman's "Up In the Air" was the best movie of 2009.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00275EGWY">The Hurt Locker</a> was good but overhyped.  The under-the-radar (in this country) BBC made-for-TV two-part docudrama <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H8CK78">Occupation - Series 1 ( Occupation - Series One )  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 Import - United Kingdom </a>] was better than 'The Hurt Locker' in many respects.<br /><br />About 'Up In the Air': rarely has a film so incisively and painfully captured the spirit of the moment - mass layoffs, soulless firings, disconnected and transient lives.  Welcome to Corporate America, recession, jobless recoveries, the threat of double-dip recession and the possibility of more of the same over a long term.  Reitman's film nails the fallout from all that.  His coup is that interspersed amongst the scripted drama are interviews with real laid-off workers.  You can tell when these pop up in the narrative - there is real, palpable fear, anger and disappointment voiced to which no scripted work could do justice.  Reitman juxtaposes those pieces with the production line-like layoff work conducted by the characters portrayed by George Clooney, Anna Kendrick and Jason Bateman.  It's great film-making that serves to shake the heart and confidence of any working viewer.<br /><br />There's also some nice work here in smaller roles by the always good J.K. Simmons, Zach Galifianakis and - in a slightly bigger role - Danny McBride as Clooney's character's soon-to-be (or maybe not-to-be) brother-in-law.  And you'll burst out laughing when Sam Elliott makes his brief but all-too-perfect cameo.</p></body></html>

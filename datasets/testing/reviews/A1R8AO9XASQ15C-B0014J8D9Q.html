<meta name="summary" content="One hard movie"></head><body><p>That's how I would describe &quot;Unforgiven&quot; -- as hard as the title implies. It's a classic, no doubt, every bit as good as Eastwood's other great film, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales,&quot; maybe a little better.<p>It's taken me years to fully appreciate the power and accomplishment of this movie. Eastwood himself refused to make it until after he'd reached a certain age, and it takes a certain level of maturity to accept that this movie HAS NO HEROES, that it is about death and dying, that it is about a way of life that has long vanished ... a way that, in the hardboiled view of this movie, wasn't all that great to begin with.<p>&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the few successful films that has no sympathetic characters. Eastwood's William Munny is a criminal, a thug whose late-in-life recognition of his own dastardly deeds does not necessarily clear him of them (hence the title). His buddy, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) is no saint either, simply too old and guilt-ridden to live the outlaw life any longer. Likewise, the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett, and whatever happened to him?) is the cowboy equivalent of a punk, a gangsta wannabe with more mouth than guts (he's the only character in the movie to experience a moral revelation).<p>Which brings us to the &quot;bad guy,&quot; Little Bill Daggett, played with clear-eyed hate by Gene Hackman. What a complex character. The guy just wants to build a house and watch the sunset over his coffee. He can't hammer two nails into a board. He wants law and order in his frontier town, and he'll get it if he has to beat a man to death. He's cowardly -- once he's disarmed a man and surrounded him with trigger-happy &quot;deputies,&quot; then he lets fly with his fists -- but maybe he's just playing a dangerous game the smart way. And he is smart. Smarter than Will Munny, only not quite as lucky.<p>Let us not forget the prostitutes who set the plot in motion. Strawberry Alice seems to desire bloody revenge far more than Delilah, the girl whose face is slashed by the cowboys. All of the women in the film are hard, brutal, deceptive, obsessed with avenging themselves of the very livelihood that pays the bounty. Not a likeable or sympathetic character in the bunch.<p>Finally, there's English Bob (Richard Harris). Eastwood establishes that he's come to Big Whiskey for the bounty so subtly that, believe it or not, I missed it the first time I saw the movie. (Maybe it's a little too subtle -- no dialogue refers to his motivation.) English Bob gits the tar whupped out of him, but he's not a good guy, just a &quot;living legend&quot; whose legend has finally caught up with him.<p>There is a journey in the movie, but it's an anti-heroic journey with only one outcome: that Will Munny will actually lose his battle with his demons and commit murder in exchange for filthy lucre. (The character's name is not a coincidence.) Not exactly a healthy outlook on the human condition.<p>&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is what certain critics mean when they describe a movie as &quot;dark,&quot; only here the description actually applies. It is dark, and it does not contain a glimmer of hope for anything or anyone. &quot;Deserve's got nothing to do with it,&quot; Munny tells Little Bill. And yet everybody in the movie gets exactly what they deserve ... including Will Munny, who's left alone with the demons of his past.<p>The movie is great precisely because of its pessimism; I don't know another way to put it. It is the death of the Western; it is also sad and moving, physically beautiful and vividly acted. Ten years ago, I sorta kinda felt &quot;Unforgiven&quot; didn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar. Now I sorta kinda feel that it's too good for it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of modern sci-fi's greatest inspirations!"></head><body><p>The initial reason I took a look at `Forbidden Planet' was because I'd heard that it influenced both Gene Roddenberry when he developed  `Star Trek', and George Lucas when he was conceptualizing the `Star Wars' saga. Any movie that was an inspiration to the two biggest sci-fi franchises of all time (and two of my faves) is definitely worth a viewing!<br /><br /> After growing up watching `Airplane!' and `The Naked Gun', it's kinda strange seeing Leslie Nielsen play a more-serious role as the ship's commander. No double-takes in reaction to strange sight gags? No droll one-liners with the straightest face one can imagine? Definitely something I'm not used to...<br /><br />Then there's the introduction of one of sci-fi's ultimate legends- Robby the Robot! Being one of the more fortunate cast-members of this little adventure, Robby would make many subsequent appearances through the decades in TV-Land, including a throw-down with the `Lost In Space' robot, and staying over at Mork's place for a few days. I think he's hanging out in some Hollywood museum somewhere nowadays. If anybody knows where Robby's hangin' out nowadays, let me know!<br /><br />Although I'm not an absolutist when it comes to movies in the widescreen, there are exceptions. This movie in particular is one of them. I remember two particular scenes- Robby giving a monkey a bit of a zap to make him behave, and the Cap'n having to vaporize a tiger- that went the full width of the screen, and looked really weird when the studio panned &amp; scanned it for the VHS release. In this case, for maximum cinema enjoyment, wider IS better!<br /><br />`Late</p></body></html>

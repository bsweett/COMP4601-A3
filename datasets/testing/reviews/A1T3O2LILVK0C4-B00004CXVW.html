<meta name="summary" content="Tune In... Or Fall Out!"></head><body><p>When it comes down to it, a large part of who we are comes from our collective experiences, from our past, from our memories. But what if our memories weren't our own? What if all of our experiences were generic? What if our pasts had been manufactured? Would it then be possible to manipulate us through our memories? Luckily, no one has that power... or do they?<br /><br />John Murdoch awakens to find himself naked and vulnerable. He has no memory of his past or of his own identity. The only thing he knows is that he's lost in a mystery, a mystery that only deepens when he finds a dead woman's body in the hotel room where he is staying. He quickly dresses himself and checks out (wouldn't you?). But things only become more complicated when eerie people begin to pursue him, accusing him of the murder. Soon he comes face to face with a startling realization: every night, at midnight, the world stops and time is frozen. During this nether hour people's memories are altered, the city literally reconfigures itself and alien beings known as "Strangers" control everything. But John Murdoch has powers too. Will he master them before he is destroyed? Will he use them to liberate the dark city or to enslave it further?<br /><br />Director Alex Proyas (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059XUO">The Crow</a>) creates a gothic, expressionist metropolis in this mind-bending thriller. He utilizes his strong sense of visual direction but also creates an intriguing tale of identity. The issues touched upon are timely. What makes an individual? Do people control their own fates or are we slaves to a higher power? Can mankind redeem itself? Is time just an illusion? What makes Dark City so unique is that it raises serious questions but, for the most part, leaves the answers to the viewers. It's interesting to note that this film came out about a year before <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K19E">The Matrix</a> popularized thought-provoking sci-fi films.<br />Some critics have complained that the acting is stiff (which it's meant to be), while others panned the film for simply being too bizarre (which is why I love it). Regardless, it's obviously a misunderstood film. As for the acting, the performances recall old noir films from the 1940s. Rufus Sewell, William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly would all be right at home in an old-fashioned detective movie. Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, seems to be a combination of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with Victor Frankenstein. As for the Strangers, they seem to be an offshoot of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers' drones. The acting is appropriately awkward as none of the characters are fully realized. They are drones programmed and reprogrammed every night, never allowed to evolve or develop. The screenplay was written by Alex Proyas, David S. Goyer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780624890">Blade</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUYP4Q">Batman Begins</a>) and Lem Dobbs (Kafka).<br /><br />The original DVD release features both Widescreen & Full Screen versions of the film, two audio commentaries, numerous essays and reviews, etc. Also included is a hilariously BAD game, Find Shell Beach, which features some of the worst video graphics I've ever seen. But overall if you dig freaky fantasy films, dreary detective tales or surreal sci-fi then Dark City should appeal to you.<br /><br />Just after writing this review, I became aware of an upcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018O4YT0">Dark City (Director's Cut)</a> edition that will be available July 29 2008. This means that there will be two different versions available in the retail market. Although I have reviewed this version of the film, I also suggest giving the new edition a try.</p></body></html>

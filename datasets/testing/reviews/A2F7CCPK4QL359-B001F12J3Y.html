<meta name="summary" content="The Way Disney Used to Be"></head><body><p>BELIEVE<br /><br />The Polar Express is one of those feel good films that Disney use to do long ago and someone needed to do it. This  simple story about a special train taking a group of children to the North Pole to meet Santa before magical ride.<br /><br />The roto-scope process of  animation gives this holiday video such a magical feel especially in the widescreen process. You can see why the film was on the IMAX screen.  This Half human/half cartoon-ish effect gives this film like a timeless classic. The effects are stunning, the cinematic ride is stunning and overwhelming in  visual department and amazing in its scope and range.<br /><br />Tom Hanks dons many verbal character hats in this production, including  the all knowing conductor and SANTA.<br /><br />There is simple message that flows in this film, that makes this film morer than a Christmas favorite. Disney use to have that, but not anymore-its that simple charm with no pretention nor preachiness.  It  should be shown with your favorite Christmas holiday classics  like White Christmas, Holiday Inn How the Grinch that Stole Christmas (cartoon not film),Frosty the Snowman, An American Christmas Carol (with Henry Winkler),  Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Die Hard (well everyone has a guilty holiday pleasure)<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

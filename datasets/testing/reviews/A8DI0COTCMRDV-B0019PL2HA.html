<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely Ridiculous !"></head><body><p>I've got this problem! See,I'm a nascar fan but I can't stand rednecks. I know that puts me in the minority class(literally)but lucky for me because of that fact I just knew I was gonna enjoy this one from the word go & I definitely did. How could I not? This is a goofy movie that simply exsaggerates the truly idiotic behaviour of (not all) but most rednecks from all corners of the nascar community. Fans,Drivers,teams,owners ect. There definitely were a few dry spots but all the laughs make you forget about any of that. What I absolutely loved about the film is that it purposely doesn't take itself at all serious. One thing I can't stand about most mainstream comedies these days(both movies & tv)is when they try to throw a moral or two into the mix of an immorally funny situation. With "Talladega Nights" though,every time you expect a lame & cliche moral with a soft & puffy texture to be thrown into the mix they do a 180 on you by throwing in a nonsensical ludicrous & sometimes down right offensive but hilarious joke or situation rolled up in a big ball of stupidity wich inturn tickles the funnybone of any viewer just looking for a careless laugh such as myself. This film is for everyone not just nascar fans. As a matter of fact it may play better to non nascar fans,but I will say that being a diehard race fan & being truly embarrassed by the pea brain fan base that follows one of my favorite sports 'The Ballad of Ricky Bobby'(for me personally) is just what the doctor ordered.</p></body></html>

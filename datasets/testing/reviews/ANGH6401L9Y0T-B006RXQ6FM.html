<meta name="summary" content="Fine Drama About a Very Troubling Topic"></head><body><p>Meryl Streep plays Sister Aloysius Beauvier, principal of an urban Catholic school in 1964. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Father Brendan Flynn, the parish priest. Joseph Foster II plays Donald Miller, the first black student in the school and an altar boy. Amy Adams plays his history teacher, Sister James.<br /><br />Ah, you're getting the picture already, aren't you?<br /><br />Sister Aloysius is suspicious of Father Flynn, although she does not specify why. It's not just the sermon he gives on the topic of Doubt, but as she puts it, "I know people." Indeed she does, but we may be left with a question as to whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Father Flynn is only slightly indiscreet, and can cover his behavior with lies. But one lie (I'm trying not to give away too much) leaves the boy taking punishment for something that was really Father Flynn's doing.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius asks Donald's parents to come and talk with her, but only his mother shows up. She reveals some important facts about what's going on, as well as her attitude toward the situation and her husband's. The audience has no choice but to conclude that this boy is in a total trap. There is nothing, literally nothing, he can do to improve his situation.<br /><br />The same cannot be said of Sister Aloysius. And I will leave it there so as to avoid ruining the conclusion. In the very end, she is sitting in the courtyard which is covered with snow when Sister James finds her, and talks over with her exactly what happened. Her last line is "I have such doubts. Such doubts."<br /><br />It's a moving story, but it's hard to know with whom to sympathize, who to blame. It's just a very tragic story. However, I did decide who to blame: the bishop.</p></body></html>

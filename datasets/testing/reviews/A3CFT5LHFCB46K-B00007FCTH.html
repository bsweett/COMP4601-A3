<meta name="summary" content="A Good but overall disappointing documentary"></head><body><p>I watched this documentary as part of the Citizen Kane DVD. It is good, telling about the power struggle between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst. I also never knew before just how much Welles and Herman J. Mankewickz borrowed from Hearst's life when they wrote the Citizen Kane screenplay. But though it was supposed to be about Citizen Kane, the documentary didn't tell that much about the film itself.

The extras were also nil, there being only a chapter selection and ads for other documentaries...</p></body></html>

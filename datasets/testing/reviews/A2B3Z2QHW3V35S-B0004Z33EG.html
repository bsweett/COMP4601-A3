<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie"></head><body><p>I'm not usually into a lot of action movies. But because of my hubby I do watch them and enjoy them. My husband is a big fan of Rambo. He can watch Rambo movies all day. When he was a kid he use to dress up and fight like Rambo. For awhile Rambo was the name people gave him. Now as an adult he still wishes he was Rambo. He buys knifes and calls it his Rambo knifes.... lol. He plays paintball and tells everyone he is Rambo.... lol.</p></body></html>

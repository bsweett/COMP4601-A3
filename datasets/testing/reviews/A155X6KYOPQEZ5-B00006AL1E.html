<meta name="summary" content="Great Trilogy and NOTHING wrong with it!"></head><body><p>The Back to the Future trilogy is GREAT! I bought it a year ago and it is outstanding. I don't see how other reviewers could criticize this trilogy because there is NOTHING wrong with mine. The "widescreen" isn't off the page or anything. The trilogy is just like any other. As for the actual movies, they're amazing. Back to the Future is one of my favorite movies. (especially when I like the idea of time travel) The delorean is what really brings out all the movies. As for others, I definately recommend this to you!</p></body></html>

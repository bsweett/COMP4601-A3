Still, he's a lot more careless than Bryan Singer. He goes for a no one is safe approach and kills off some main characters. He also wanted to introduce new mutants, which is why he killed off some people and why Night Crawler is no where to be seen. Kelsey Grammer is at least a good addition to the cast as Beast and same with Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. Vinnie Jones isn't a bad Juddernaught as well. He's the best new villain, but all the other villains that Ratner introduced though are undeveloped and just wear leather and look like porn stars lol. So half of them I didn't even know if they were from the comics or not since we don't even get their names.<br /><br />  While there's no going back with how bad it is with what they did with Cyclops. James Marsden was punished for choosing to be in Superman Returns but they all punished fans as well. While Famke Janssen who was excellent in X-2 is just wasted here with a blank stare and barely any lines as Dark Phoenix. Halle Berry who always demanded that Storm had more to do since...she's an Oscar winner got her wish though. Cyclops gets pushed back as leader just so we get more of her. Meanwhile someone needs to crush her ego by reminding her that she was in CatWoman. She was never even right for the part of Storm. It's Jenssen who actually deserved more to do as Jean Grey.<br /><br />  As a last film the movie doesn't work as well since it hints to things to come in the credits. Which is why it bugs me when some fans say, hey there's still origin movies coming out. I just want to know what happens next. We already have a good idea to what happened with Wolverine before the X-men movies. Same with Magneto who also has an origin movie coming out. I'm not sure how they could clean up the mess that Ratner made with this film with a part 4 but I'd still like to Singer come back and try. He at least loves and respects the characters enough not to kill them off.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pigging out on cocktail weenies"></head><body><p>The day after I watched the DVD of MARIA FULL OF GRACE, it's star, Catalina Moreno, was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. I guess my viewing put her over the top.<br /><br />Catalina plays Maria, a 17-year old Colombian whose life is in the dumpster. She's pregnant by her worthless boyfriend; she quits her job de-thorning rose stalks after her male boss won't let her leave the assembly line to go to the loo and vomit; her mother and self-centered sister, the latter also an unwed mother, berate her for abandoning the major portion of the family's earning power. What's a poor girl to do? Why, of course, go to Bogota and volunteer to become a "mule", i.e., someone who jets into the United States with his/her belly full of miniature sausage-shaped baggies of cocaine. After practicing swallowing large, red grapes - I would have picked those little cocktail weenies - off she goes to New York with sixty-something of the packets onboard and the promise of $5,000 when she delivers. And, as the drug middleman warns her, don't lose any on the way because "we know where your family lives". In any case, Maria finds herself on the international flight with three other mules. Only one comes back.<br /><br />With her Oscar nomination as Best Actress, is Moreno in the same league with the likes of Imelda Staunton (VERA DRAKE), Annette Benning (BEING JULIA), and Hilary Swank (MILLION DOLLAR BABY)? Most assuredly not. Perhaps her inclusion represents the relative dearth of great female screen performances in 2004; there's little from which to choose. However, having said that, Catalina's performance is a very fine one, especially for one so new to the Biz. A golden statue is within her reach in the future.<br /><br />The creators of MARIA FULL OF GRACE remained disingenuously neutral throughout about the morality of the drug trade. Rather, the film focuses on the unremarkably commonplace economic pressures that pushed Maria, ostensibly a young and intelligent woman of otherwise average morality, into a venture that subsequently caused her so much anguish, mortal fear, and inconvenience. One would hope that the experience would make her a vocal DARE advocate, but perhaps that's too much to expect in today's world. In the great scheme of things, the causes of evil and suffering can be banal indeed, and just go on and on.</p></body></html>

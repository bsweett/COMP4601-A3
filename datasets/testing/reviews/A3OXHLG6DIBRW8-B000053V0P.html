This is just a fun movie that has a very likeable cast, great special effects, exciting action scenes, a lot of humor, and more scientific flaws and plot holes than just about any movie other than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AKCKM">The Core (Widescreen Edition)</a> (which was not a fun movie to watch, even the first time).<br /><br />The plot is fairly straight forward, aliens are here and they do not come in peace. With their overwhelming technology (remember, they brought their entire civilization light-years across the vastness of space in ships 1/6 the mass of the moon), they should be able to easily wipe out mankind and just take what they want, but they obviously didn't count on Will Smith (a very self confident fighter pilot) and Jeff Goldblum (an under achieving technical genius) to team up against them. There are a lot of plot devices to move the show along, mostly in the form of a string of improbable coincidences, stereotypical characters, and unlikely technical wizardry.<br /><br />All that taken into consideration, this is still an incredibly watchable and enjoyable movie (we own it on DVD, Blu-Ray, and have even used "On-Demand" to watch it on my PC when stranded in an airport).<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

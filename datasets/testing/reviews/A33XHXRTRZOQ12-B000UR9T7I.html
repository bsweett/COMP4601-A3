First of all, I was fairly impressed by the way "Sandman" was done, though they portrayed him a little too sympathetically, as opposed to the way he was played in the magazine originally. In the original story introducing the character, he was given the standard, smarmy villain's personality....snarling, sassing Spidey whenever he could, threatening ....but in the movie, he's almost always silent as he fights Spiderman...and what FIGHTS!! Boy...Petey didn't like him much, did he?<br /><br />Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, THIS is the Spidey flick Roger Ebert should have saved his "best superhero flick" praise for, (it really IS the best of the Spiderman movies, but none of the Spidey flicks is "the best superhero movie EVER....") Jolly Jonah is the best he's ever been portrayed, live action, Topher Grace was a convincing proto-yuppie as Eddie Brock and all the drama and comedy relief was well done. And is it just me, or was Mary Jane's singing pretty much perfect in that dress rehearsal? Those producers had tin ears!<br /><br />There's a nod to "Daredevil" in the middle of the film, where Brock actually prays to the Almighty in a church, (while Spidey is there with his "Venom" coating,) to "kill Peter Parker" after Parker reveals him as a fraud in the Daily Bugle newsroom. Brock also eventually finds out Peter is Spiderman, so things get hairy from then on. A pattern is made rather obvious as Mary Jane is again used as a pawn in a game of death near the climax of the film. However, this is still handled well, and is a little tenser than the school bus scene in the first Spidey film.<br /><br />All in all, if you thought something was missing from the first "Spiderman" film, as I did, THIS one makes up for it! Rent it, or buy it, and enjoy!</p></body></html>

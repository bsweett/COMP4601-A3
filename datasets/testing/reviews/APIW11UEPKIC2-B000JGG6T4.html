The movie starts out pretty slow, and then the director figures out he's driving a Ferrari and really pushes it's limits.  Denzel does not hold back in this movie.  Storyline-watch and find out, it's not a great storyline, but it's always changing.  One minute you think you know what is going on, the next you jaw has been dropped.  Then you keep watching to find out what Denzel's gonna do, but we shouldn't have to guess, he's gonan go off on everybody that gets in his way.</p></body></html>

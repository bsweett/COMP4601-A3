It's extremely graphic without much more to fall back on.  The setup is simplistic--missionaries want to do the right thing by bringing aid to those oppressed by the Burmese Army, and nothing about it goes well.<br />Everything about this film is an effort to exhibit the most gross aspects of battle, with almost no character development, minimal context, no chemistry amongst the cast.  Even the action can't stand without a blood bath.  The only other notable facet of this film is trying to figure out what cosmetic surgery Stallone has done.  The irony of missionaries vs murderous rampages is more than a bit blunt.</p></body></html>

I wanted to see this documentary for two reasons: #1 To find out why people are against universal health care, #2 To see what crazy thing Michael Moore would do to bring attention to it. I found this film fascinating. During my time as a freelancer, I remember being called several times about being examined for an ear infection that turned out to be stress. I was beyond belief that a health insurance company would even consider the idea of not providing health care for me for being tired. Seriously?! This film was eye opening, from the guy who lost his finger, how the 9/11 rescue workers were treated, why parents had to move in with their children and how much profit is made from the health insurance industry. I expected all of that, but what I didn't know was the health care insurance benefits in Cuba, Canada and Europe. Whether you're for or against health care (or Obamacare as it's been nicknamed recently), I think this is an educational film to learn more about the industry as a whole. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Note: That $12,000 donation was classic!</p></body></html>

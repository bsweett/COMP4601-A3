<meta name="summary" content="Great action, mixed message"></head><body><p>A wonderfully executed action movie with a mixed message, The Kingdom stars Jamie Foxx as Ronald Fleury, the leader of an elite group of FBI government agents (which also includes Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman) who are assigned to investigate the bombing of an American facility in the Middle East.  Things aren't quite what they seem however, and soon enough Fleury and his crew have five days to figure out just what happened.  As The Kingdom moves along, Fleury and his crew find unlikely allies and traverse the local politics, leading up to an explosive finale.  With everything that The Kingdom does action-wise, it disappoints in it's script.  The entire film sends a mixed message that feels as if it doesn't even know what it's trying to convey to the viewer.  This isn't always noticeable thanks to the great performances from Foxx and co., and director Peter Berg (Hancock, Friday Night Lights) manages to wonderfully orchestrate some spectacular, and surprising, action sequences.  All in all, despite the mixed message that The Kingdom delivers, it's worth seeing for the action elements alone, which are enough to make anyone stand up and cheer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Visuals, Poor Script"></head><body><p>"Prometheus" is a Ridley Scott sci-fi action movie, which means it has amazing cinematography and tough heroines. If you are looking for them, you will not be disappointed. But how about the story? Please don't expect an intelligent and intricate screenplay here because "Prometheus," an indirect prequel to the "Alien" franchise, is a typical case of Hollywood blockbuster full of sound and fury, a visual extravaganza with so many big plot holes.<br /><br />Set in 2093, an expedition team of scientists and experts including an archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is sent on a mission to the moon LV-223. This is a trillion-dollar project financed by the Weyland Corporation (the CEO Peter Weyland is played by a nearly unrecognizable Guy Pearce), to discover the "Engineers" and secrets about the origin of the humans.<br /><br />The film starts promisingly, benefitting the veteran director's assured control of scenes, but as the story of "Prometheus" (script penned by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof) unfolds, you may have a very strong feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. While the film's main theme is very ambitious, each set-piece looks as if borrowed from some other sci-fi films including Ridley Scott's own works.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender plays an android David. Though Fassbender as always delivers a solid performance, the android's decision making is random and sometimes unaccountable. The way he speaks reminds us of HAL9000, but Fassbender's character behaves more illogically than the computer of "2001: A Space Odyssey." In fact, there are so many illogical motives and implausible situations in "Prometheus," where characters almost always end up doing things in a wrong way.<br /><br />Had "Prometheus" been directed by someone other than Ridley Scott, what would the film have been like? A terrible mess of a grade-B sci-fi movie, perhaps. "Prometheus" is a gorgeous-looking and action-packed sci-fi film, of which poor storyline is barely covered by the special effects.</p></body></html>

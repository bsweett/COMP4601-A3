<meta name="summary" content="A WONDERFUL MIX OF ACTION, COMEDY AND HORROR!"></head><body><p>This thoroughly enjoyable film is masterfully put together by Tarantino and is one of his most impressive films. It's well paced and each element is fined tuned as to not cancel each other out. By that I mean, The comedy and over the top action never make the film any less horrifying.<br /><br />Tarantino also has a knack for casting his films perfectly with character actors and or surprising guest appearances by people you wouldn't expect to see in a film...or this type of film. Tom Savini FX wizard and monster maker has a great humorous role as a bad a $ $ biker and Fred Williamson as a bruising trucker!<br /><br />This is also one of the only films that I own that stars George Clooney, who is a likable guy, but I have never been a big fan. He manages to play his smarmy persona to perfection in this fun and gory fright flick.<br /><br />The film starts out like a action crime drama and turns into a hilarious and scary comedy horror film. It's really an excellent piece of work and  it's not an easy thing to accomplish! The acting is heads above films of this nature, the FX are gross.....but in a fun way and the film will breeze by it's hour and 48 minute running length.<br /><br />It's exploitation at it's best with a fair amount of naked skin at the T I T T Y Twister after hours bar! Salma Hayek's erotic dance is also a highlight! The colorful cast includes Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin(in 3 roles!)and Tarantino in a fun role as Clooney's delusional brother!<br /><br />I had seen this film a few times, but it had been a while and watching it now, you can see elements of Tarantino's future projects - The Grind House Films Presents - Planet Terror and Death Proof in this extremely wild movie! The two disc collector's edition is awesome and well worth looking for! It's loaded with feature-ettes, out takes, deleted scenes, a commentary trailers and on and on!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Fantastic Film"></head><body><p>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a movie that one loves or hates.  The story is a mixture of detective story and science fiction, the kind of story that was made into serials of the 1930's and 40's.  Intrepid newspaper report Polly Perkins (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is hard after a story that leads her to a mysterious scientist named Totenkopf (or Dead Head).  The Sky Captain of the title is a flying ace named Joe Sullivan (Jude Law) who has the benefit of using space-age technology (from a plane that doubles as a submarine to a ray gun) invented by his sidekick Dex (played by Giovanni Ribisi).  Totenkopf is also quite an inventor and has a fleet of flying robots invade New York early in the film. Of course, Polly Perkins and Joe Sullivan have a past and their arguments make them seem like a married couple.  Angelina Jolie makes a brief appearance as Frankie, who commands a hovering aircraft carrier.  The futuristic inventions give the movie an interesting twist since we don't know what to expect next.<br /><br />The big difference with this film is that it was almost entirely computer generated.  The city streets, cars, buildings etc. were created by computer effects.  If I had not known how it was made I might have guessed that the film had gone through a colorizing process: the colors tend to be shades of grey with washed-out flesh tones.  The eye does become accustomed to the look of the film and the muted colors add much to the overall atmosphere.  All of the CGI effects allowed the file creator Kerry Conan (somebody who truly wore all kinds of hats in this production) to do some fantastic effects.  The opening scenes showing the docking of a German blimp is nicely done and the robot effects were fabulous, particularly the scene where Gwyneth Paltrow is trying to get a picture of the robots and avoid getting stepped on.<br /><br />The DVD extras include an interesting "making of" feature that included interviews and gave an excellent idea of how the concept of this film was born.  One gets an appreciation of all of the work that went into the effects and the difficulty the actors overcame by having nothing but a blue screen to react to. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may not be what some critics would call a movie with a message but is pure entertainment, reaching back to old serials and sci-fi movies to make something visually stunning and nicely acted.  It holds your interest much like Raiders of the Lost Ark which has an equally fantastic story and improbabilities.  Just sit back and enjoy.</p></body></html>

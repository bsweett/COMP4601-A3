<meta name="summary" content="Shyamalan continues his occult journey"></head><body><p>In the summer of 1999, Disney released a movie written and directed by a little know director named M. Night Shyamalan. Studio executives hoped that the movie, a supernatural thriller, would perform well and make a profit. To their surprise and delight, it became a smash hit all around the world. The movie was The Sixth Sense. As you most likely know, it was about a child psychologist [Bruce Willis] who tried to help a young boy [Haley Joel Osment] who claimed to see dead people. In his newest movie, Unbreakable, Mr. Shyamalan again returns to the occult with a spooky tale about a man who is a super hero and doesn't know it. <p>Bruce Willis again stars. This time he is David Dunn, a mild-mannered, frequently depressed guy who works as a security guard in Philadelphia. As the movie opens, he is returning home on a train. He gets an odd feeling, and the next thing he knows, there is a terrible wreck. He is the only passenger who survives. His wife and son are ecstatic. Not only he is alive, he has escaped without a scratch. The fact remains that David and his wife, Audrey [Robin Wright Penn], are planning to divorce. The train trip was for a job interview in New York City. Though estranged from Audrey, David is exceptionally close to his son, Joseph [Spencer Treat Clark]. The impending separation is tearing everyone apart.<p>Leaving a memorial service for the victims, David finds a note engraved with the words "Limited Edition". Inside, someone has written, "How many times in your life have you been sick?" He traces the note to a chic art gallery that specializes in comic book art. The note was written by the owner, Elijah [Samuel L. Jackson], a strange and slightly ominous man who suffers from a genetic disease that causes his bones to be brittle and to break easily. It is he who thinks that David is more than he appears to be. Elihah tells him he may be someone with special powers, someone who can tap into the forces of good in order to fight evil. Naturally, David thinks Elijah is a nut case. He even orders Joseph, who as accompanied him, not to drink the water Elijah has given him. Yet he also senses something in what Elijah has said. Soon, odd things start to happen, and David finally realizes that the answer to Elijah's question is that he has never been sick a day in his life. But what does this fact, as well as recent events, mean? And what is Elijah's interest in it?<p>There are many similarities here to The Sixth Sense, including a surprise ending. For several reasons, Unbreakable doesn't work quite as well. It has many interesting elements, including lots of references to comic book heroes. There is a theme involving water that is excellent. The photography and the set decoration are impeccable. The cast is great. But Unbreakable is even more dark and brooding than The Sixth Sense, its pace is slower, and its ending is even more far fetched. As a result, many viewers will find it less enjoyable. I don't think this is all Shyamalan's fault. When your last picture was a boxoffice phenomenon, it truly is a tough act to follow.<p>I was intrigued to discover that the director's next project, Signs, is about a farm couple who finds mysterious crop circles in their fields. The supernatural theme continues. Wouldn't it be great if Shyamalan turned out to be the next Alfred Hitchcock by devoting himself to just one genre or theme? I thought of this while watching Unbreakable because, after all, even movies by The Master of Suspense varied greatly in success, both artistically and commercially. It was the body of work by Hitchcock that was important, and I hope the same proves true of Mt. Shyamalan.</p></body></html>

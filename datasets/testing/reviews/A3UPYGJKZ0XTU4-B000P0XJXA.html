<meta name="summary" content="Nice Looking. Bad Writing."></head><body><p>&quot;Spartan&quot; is the eighth film written and directed by playwright David Mamet. It stars Val Kilmer as a elite secret agent with paramilitary training who does dirty work for various U.S. Government agencies. He goes by the name of Mr. Scott, but we're led to believe that's not his real name. When the President's daughter disappears from her college campus, apparently kidnapped, Mr. Scott is assigned to assist the Secret Service in finding her. They have only two days to find and retrieve Laura Newton (Kristen Bell) before the news media get ahold of the story. Scott tracks her down. A rescue mission is planned. But things aren't as they appear.<p>&quot;Spartan&quot; is not an adrenaline-pumping thriller. It's more of a puzzle. It's filmed in a shadowy, brooding style. A surprising number of scenes take place at night. &quot;Spartan&quot; presents an extremely cynical view of politics and power, which might be interesting if the story made any sense. Not only does the story not make sense, the dialogue doesn't either. It's conspicuously unnatural and consistently nonsensical. I think Val Kilmer's timing is poor in a few places, but it's hard to tell, because the lines are cringe-inducing anyway. Derek Luke and Tia Texada give the most memorable performances as young rookie agents Curtis and Black. I'm giving &quot;Spartan&quot; three stars for the cinematography by Juan Ruiz Anchia. I like the way this film looks. But the writing is just plain bad.<p>The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by Val Kilmer and a theatrical trailer. Don't watch the trailer before the movie. It's full of spoilers. The audio commentary is interesting in spots but a little frustrating because it meanders and contains a lot of long pauses. Kilmer also frequently doesn't comment on the scene that he's looking at. It's very stream-of-consciousness. It gives more insight into Val Kilmer than into the film, so I would recommend it for his fans only.</p></body></html>

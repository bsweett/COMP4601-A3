<meta name="summary" content="a remkake that surpasses the original"></head><body><p>i saw the 1974 version and i liked it but in soe ways it was kinda... cheesy. i mean the whole dinner scene is nothing more then a prolonged death and with no sense of humor. now the 2003 has redone the film but takes out the cheesyness and just gives you a cold-blooded movie with very little hope. the movie starts out saying about the actual incident and then it goes into the film. five adults are heading to a concert and on there way the pick up a strangler who has experinced something tromatic. after a very tense 2 minutes, she kills herself and the adults are freaking out. they then come to a town that is full of a family of madmen and cannibles. after that the movie takes pace to funny, disturbing, dark, and then picth. this is a way better version then the 1974. see it with no lights but have someone with and rediscover "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"</p></body></html>

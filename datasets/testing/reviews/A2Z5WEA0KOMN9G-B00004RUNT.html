However, I think it is a very funny movie and has some good action sequences.  Especially the cab chase at the beginning and the gun fight at the end.  The gun fight at the end reminded me of some of the Shadow Run games we used to play.  Gary Oldman was perfect as Zorg and Bruce Willis was perfect as Corbin Dallas.<p>Not one of the best movies out there, but certainly better than many others.</p></body></html>

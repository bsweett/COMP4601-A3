<meta name="summary" content="There Needs to be a Collector's or Special Edition"></head><body><p>NOTE:  THE TWO STARS IS FOR THE DVD, NOT THE MOVIE.  THE MOVIE DESERVES 5 STARS.<p>Yes, this review doesn't really concern the movie.  Just know that "Goodfellas" is one of my favorite Mafia movies.  Everything about the movie is superb, and it deserves 5 stars all the way.  So please, DO NOT THINK THAT THIS REVIEW IS ATTACKING THE MOVIE, because it's not.<p>What this review IS attacking is this terrible DVD.  I didn't know I was buying a smaller version of a laserdisk.  Why does the movie have to be on two sides???  I don't get it.  Yeah, it might be a long movie, but they were able to fit "Casino" all on one side.  So what's up with that?<p>There better be a special or collector's edition coming out soon, because this movie needs one bad.  Not just because it's a classic and a masterpiece, but because it needs to be on ONE side!  When I buy a DVD, I expect just that.<p>Other than the movie being on both sides, the DVD really lacks in special features, the picture quality is so-so, and the sound could've been improved in some parts.<p>Again, "Goodfellas" is a masterpiece in my mind, and it deserves 5 stars.  But the DVD is just awful.  In fact, calling the DVD "awful" is being too polite.<p>Warner Bros.:  Come out with a special edition, for crying out-loud!!!<p>If you love this movie, don't get the DVD.  Just get it on VHS and wait until a better version comes out.  TRUST ME on this one.  Unless they have updated the movie and placed it all on one side.  If that's the case, please let me know and I will have to re-buy it.<p>I will write a real review for the movie in the VHS section sometime soon.<p>Again, the low rating is for the DVD; NOT the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Resevior Dogs is a spectacular movie in many ways"></head><body><p>This movie, together with Pulp Fiction, is fantastic. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn are equally effective in their roles. Steve Buscemi, however, steals damned near all of his scenes. ("Why do I have to be Mr. Pink?") Even the voice of Stephen Wright as the radio DJ is perfect. It's hard to believe that a debut film by an unknown (at the time) director could pack this much wallop and star power. 'Pulp Fiction' is a great film but it still can't match this one for sheer power and energy. As for the DVD transfer, good job! Two formats, great sound, and extra goodies makes it a worthwhile addition to your collection. You do not know what a seriously good movie is until you see Reservoir Dogs.</p></body></html>

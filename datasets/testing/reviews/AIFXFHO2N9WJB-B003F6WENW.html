Generally, these movies are mostly the same, but occasionally one comes along that stands out from the rest.  Some of these rarities are films such as, "American Pie", "American Pie 2", "Van Wilder", and some would even say "Old School" or even "The 40-Year Old Virgin", on the last two movies I must disagree, I hated both films.  However, one adult comedy standout of 2005 would have to be the side-splittingly hilarious comedic duo of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in "Wedding Crashers".<br /><br />Guided by an elaborate set of `wedding crashing rules', John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and his best friend, Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn), charm their way into most any wedding, with one purpose in mind.  Hook up with some emotionally overcharged single woman, and have one night of sex, then drop them like it never happened.  Some would say this is a guy's dream come true.  Everything is going smoothly for these two `crashers' as the peak of wedding season is upon them, and go figure one of the biggest weddings ever is occurring in their very own city of Washington D.C.  As the U.S. Secretary of Treasury (Christopher Walken) has announced the wedding of his oldest daughter.  Intent on hooking up with some very rich and powerful, yet still desperate women, John and Jeremy get more than they bargained for as both of them become fixated on the other 2 daughters of the senator.  Jeremy has the misfortune of getting involved with the Secretary's somewhat crazy daughter (Isla Fisher), who after their romantic tryst has become completely obsessed with him.  While John has set his sights on the Secretary's youngest daughter (Rachel McAdams), but instead of having one night of lust, John breaks a sacred `wedding crasher' rule and begins to fall in love.  To prove himself, John drags his buddy Jeremy along to the family's estate for a fun-filled weekend that just may prove to be even too wild for these two professional party guys.<br /><br />The laughs just keep on coming in this movie, as joke after joke will leave you rolling in the aisle.  Though this movie is intended to be a comedy in every sense, there is still plenty of heart and drama to this story.  As the two main characters begin to learn that their chosen hobby is not without consequence, though nothing severe, after all this is still a comedy.  Eventually John and Jeremy realize that wedding crashing though fun, and leaving them with plenty of action, isn't as fulfilling as a meaningful relationship with a person they truly love.  The cast is spectacular and wildly eccentric from Christopher Walken, to Owen Wilson, to Jane Seymour, to Vince Vaughn, there isn't a single casting choice that could even possibly be regretted.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a laugh-a-minute comedy, and also are not easily offended, then "Wedding Crashers" is right up your alley.<br /><br />"Wedding Crashers" is rated R for language and nudity/sexuality.</p></body></html>

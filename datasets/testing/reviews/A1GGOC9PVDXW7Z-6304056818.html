Robert Kinosh?ta designed Robby and LiS's robot, thus their similarity in appearance and function. Robby's voice is Marvin Miller, best remembered as check-bearer Michael Anthony on TV's THE MILLIONAIRE. The robot's cramped interior was inhabited by little Frankie Darro. For years Darro was a juvenile star in 'B' pictures, even until age 30. Forced to do all his own stunts as there was no one Frankie's size available, stunting became a second career once he was too old to play teenagers.<br /><br />COMMANDER ADAMS' CREW--<br />George Wallace (Bosun) was Commander Cody in the 12-part serial, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YDKAJO">RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON</a> (1952).<br />Robert Dix (Crewman Grey) is son of actor Richard Dix.<br />This is the last of Jimmy Thompson's (Crewman Youngerford) seven screen appearances.

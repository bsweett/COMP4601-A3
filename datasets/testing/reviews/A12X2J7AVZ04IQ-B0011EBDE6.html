He certainly likes to make fun of the human condition, as well as foibles and short-comings which are, let's face it, amusing. I disagree with most of the other reviews, but all I can say is that I think Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson presented very individual agendas. Wilson as the control freak annoyed me for a while, until a bigger picture developed. I was entertained and amused, and "The Darjeeling Limited" was everything I would expect from a Wes Anderson film. The appearance of Anjelica Huston toward the end was accompanied by a Rolling Stones tune, which made you believe that these guys had found what they were looking for.Wes Anderson is not simplistic; indeed, I was moved and never bored by this episodic adventure. I love his choice of music. The DVD extras were few, but included "Hotel Chevalier", a sort of preface to Jack's character (Schwartzman), with Natalie Portman (not in the actual film). The "making-of" segment was actually about the making-of; no interviews with cast or director. Bummer.  Sorry, but I enjoyed it a whole lot.</p></body></html>

That makes the fact that this movie is towards the very top of the field even more significant.<p>There is easily enough to make this a good movie, especially a great story and fantastic shoot-em-up action.  What makes this movie move even higher is the duel of wits between Pacino's cop and DeNiro's thief.  These two men are pros with great respect for each other yet without the hesitation to foil the other.  This is a movie about smart people, and no one makes really stupid mistakes.  This means that success or failure is dependent on the nature of the characters and some traces of luck.<p>This is not a very emotional story and many scenes play out realistically, not dramatically.  In particular, the bank heist that forms the climactic moment of the story is coolly played out, with a minimum of situational music or strange cinematic effects.  <p>Michael Mann has directed a number of movies, but this is, to me, his magnum opus.  For fans of crime films, this is a must-see.</p></body></html>

Robert Downey Jr. was nothing but excellent at playing Iron Man. He exhibited wit, intelligence, that playboy charm and charisma: the works for a superhero. Although the plot was not strong, and there were a few holes or weak areas, the movie was excellent. But, the plot did not matter that much. This is an origin story and it was all about the characters, they are the ones that move the story forward.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was one cold blooded arms dealer, and he was great at it. I just wish we would have seen more of him. Terrence Howard was ok, not the best part of the movie. Paltrow was cute in her very capable performance. But the story centered around Tony Stark and Iron Man, and it was good. The action sequences and the special effects were excellent but did not dominate the film, which I was grateful form.<br /><br />This movie managed what many movies have not been able to do: balance. The action and special effects are enough to keep the movie going and highly entertaining, but the character development is what drives it forward, what gives it form and meaning. This movie is a must see, it is fun, funny as well, and has excellent performances.</p></body></html>

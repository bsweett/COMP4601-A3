Dr. Octopus has four machine arms that has controled him cause of his science project it has something to do with him having the power of the sun he wants to fulfilled his dream again by stealing some money at the bank spider man was their it was an amazing fight. Behind the sceens you see they did their best not to hurt the old woman while she was flying cause Dr. Octopus grab her and was climbing on the building. This movie had too many women screeming it was getting annoying to me. It look almost real when Peter Parker tryed to jump across a building but he fell all the way down and fell on cars hitting them and hit the concreat really it's just special effects.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great teen 80's flick that holds up well"></head><body><p>Breakfast Club is one of those films that has worked it's way from 80's teen flick to total cult classic.  While firmly rooted in the 80's it's story is one that that still resonates and remains timeless for people in that age group.  At turns very funny and very sad, it really works to involve its audience and carry them along for the ride as these kids sit through a Saturday detention.  The cast is great, the script has some wicked one-liners and and some great visual gags.  A real 80's classic.</p></body></html>

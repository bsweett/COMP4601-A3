It really isn't a bad remaking of the original classic.  It has great atmosphere of 1800's England and some good actors.  Special effects are good, but not always flawless.  The problem with the movie is the 200 million dollar budget.  I am trying to figure out where the money went.  There aren't a bunch of 20 million dollar actors.  The special effects are certainly not the highest grade.  The sets and atmosphere are good, but not that great.  This looks like a 50 million dollar movie.  If it had been made for that much, it would have been lauded as a success and we would have heard talk of Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, etc.  I think Universal blew the opportunity with this one.</p></body></html>

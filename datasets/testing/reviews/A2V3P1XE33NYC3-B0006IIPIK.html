Here's a film that looks and feels so different from anything modern movie audiences are used to that it's sort of difficult to get your head around the whole thing. Maybe it had something to do with the techniques Conran used to create the movie. According to the featurettes on the DVD, he created everything we see on his computer. None of the sets existed in reality. Only the actors and actresses are real (although one can certainly make an argument that Gwyneth Paltrow is not real in any way, shape, or form--an argument for another day, alas), and they had to stand in front of blue screens and basically imagine what was going on. Conran filled in all the details later. This process creates an intriguing world--the equivalent of eye candy of a particularly delicious sort I must say--albeit one that doesn't favor a human focus. We're so caught up in the breathtaking visuals that the actors and the story sort of slide into the backseat. Truth be told, there isn't much of a story to tell. What story there is exists to showcase the visuals.<br /><br />The main character in "Sky Captain" is one Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), a sort of citizen of the world, James Bond type who flits around the globe saving us from evil. He owns a really cool underground base filled with planes and various high tech gadgets. He receives help in his missions from Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi), his head scientist and a crack inventor. Whenever trouble erupts, Sullivan, otherwise known as the Sky Captain, hops in his trusty plane and flies to the scene of the crime. His latest mission promises to be a doozy. Gigantic robots are rampaging through the streets of New York, smashing their way through buildings and sending the civilian population into a frenzy. What sort of madness is this? That's for Sky Captain to find out. Fortunately, his old flame Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) is on the case. She's a hard driven reporter who possesses such a cool demeanor that she's calling her story into the paper as the robots rampage. Sullivan and Perkins must team up, amidst much wisecracking, to unlock the mystery of the robots and to stop the heinous evil behind them.<br /><br />Their adventures take them from place to place in a non-stop flurry of activity that leaves the viewer breathless. The two literally fly around the world, and under the ocean, to save the world. They discover that one Dr. Totenkopf, a World War I German scientist and all-around jerk, is the man behind the metal behemoths. He resides in an enormous complex located on a secret island guarded by all sorts of perilous henchmen. Before they can pay a visit to Totenkopf, however, Sullivan and Perkins must protect the contents of a couple of mysterious vials, and they must also rescue Dex Dearborn, who was captured during a raid on the Sky Captain's airfield. It's a tall order, but fortunately our dynamic duo can rely on the gregarious Franky (Angelina Jolie with a really cute hat and an eye patch), the commander of a British air fleet that floats, literally, through the air. Franky and the Sky Captain have a past of their own to work through, much to the consternation of Polly, but the assistance rendered by the Brits helps move the adventure along to its over the top conclusion at Totenkopf's over the top fortress. It makes sense that none other than the late Laurence Olivier plays the evil doctor.<br /><br />I couldn't hate this movie if I tried. "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" bombed big time at the box office, but a lot of critics loved it. I can see why reviewers went gaga over this flick. I think several elements factor into the critical praise. One, it's the plot and style of the film, the way Conran took the 1930s serial actioner and brought it into the modern day, that wins plaudits. The color scheme alone, a mix of blurry browns and blues that makes the movie look like a photograph taken in 1935, shows a love for old movies that literally leaps off the screen. Two, the fantastical elements, the sheer over the top effects seen in every frame of the film, take the viewer back to the heady days of childhood when going to the movies meant stepping into a magical world far different from reality. Three, and finally, the banter between the characters mirrors in no small part the sort of wordplay one would see in an old black and white movie. Movie reviewers think of films in a different way than most people. They really believe that a film should transport the viewer to a different time and place, and they're willing to applaud a movie that does just that. This is why they liked "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow".<br /><br />Despite the poor box office, I think "Sky Captain" has already proved its influence on the future of film. Just watch "300". A lot of what we see there, in a technical sense, originated with Kerry Conran's picture. Needless to say, the DVD presentation is nearly flawless. The picture and audio quality will make your jaw drop, especially if you watch this on one of those big, fancy television screens. Extras include a couple of commentary tracks featuring Conran, producer Jon Avnet, and selected members of the visual effects crew. We also get a few featurettes giving us a behind the scenes look at the film's production as well as interviews with members of the cast. A gag reel, some trailers, deleted scenes, and the original six-minute film Conran made to sell the idea to a studio round out the disc. Whew! So there you go. Check this one out posthaste. You'll have a great time!</p></body></html>

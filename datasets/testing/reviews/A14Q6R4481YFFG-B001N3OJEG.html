<meta name="summary" content="Uniformly great"></head><body><p>Sun Tzu once said that "strength everywhere is strong nowhere." That's a good way to describe this movie.  It is strong everywhere.  You cannot point to casting, or directing, or acting, or writing, or cinematography, and say "that's not as good as the rest." It's uniformly great.  Guy Pearce was fantastic in a definite breakout performance; Kevin Spacey was dead on and Russell Crowe was completely convincing as the muscle head with he heart of gold.  See, there I go -- I can't criticize any of the actors relative to the others, they were all outstanding.<br /><br />Anyhow, buy this movie for your collection and you won't be disappointed.  The DVD transfer on my copy was excellent, although I wish it had additional features.  It's well worth full price.  The movie even has a surprisingly high body count for action fans!</p></body></html>

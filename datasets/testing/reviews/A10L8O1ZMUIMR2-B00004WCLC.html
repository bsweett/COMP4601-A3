The whole movie sets up for what's coming at the end, and I guarantee you'll like it!<p>What a great cast with a good story and music. I'm usually not for mushy dramatic movies, but this one won me over. How could anyone not like this? It has comedy, romance, drama, action, and brains...all the ingredients the perfect movie needs.<p>This movie is simply about a day in the lives of several different people who are all connected in some way with either blood or chance meeting. All of their lives cross each other and mix into one on this fine day. However it takes a few viewings to understand...but not fully. To completely understand it, you'd have to live it.<p>The DVD is exactly what this fine film deserves...the royal treatment. The packaging and cover are nice to look at and the DVD comes with many bonus features that could keep you busy for hours.<p>It makes you laugh and cry all at the same time. When I think of The Perfect Movie, I think of this. Be prepared for the ending...</p></body></html>

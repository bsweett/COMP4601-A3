<meta name="summary" content="Human Flesh at its finest"></head><body><p>The ultmate zombie flick, filmed for $145,000 in 1968, completely reshaped the horror outlook for years to come. The first in a marvelous series of zombie flicks by master George Romero, this one still works today quite efficently.<br /><br /> Barbra and Johnnie are siblings, taking a stroll out in the cemetary one evening to place a wreath on their father's grave. As they walk through the cemetary, a homely old man passes them by, and attacks them with startilingly little ease. You see, there are people, er, zombies like this all around tonight. Hungry for a late night dinner of human flesh. A b&w film that's potent all the less, features 7 people barricaded inside a farmhouse, but they soon find out that they have every reason to survive, but the only thing in the way of survival is coexisting with each other. A truly brilliant film, with a shock ending that will pull you under your covers. Ben, played by Duane Jones, gives an outstanbding performance in the lead. Careful though, its easy to become attached to this cult classic.</p></body></html>

Jeez, what a grisly little pic this is.  A little slow to develop, but I think if the horror kicked in any sooner, people would probably not be able to take it.  It's that violent and creepy.<br /><br />Also some beautiful shots of Australia : beach, sunrise, sunsets - good enough to tide me over because I'm not going anytime soon!  This can scare the wits out of you!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Silence of the Lambs (1991)"></head><body><p>Director:  Jonathan Demme.<br /><br />Cast:  Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Anthony Heald, Ted Levine, Tracey Martin, Charles Napier, Brooke Smith.<br /><br />Running Time:  121 minutes.<br /><br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<br /><br />Rivaling "Seven" as the best thriller of the decade, "Silence of the Lambs" is the quintessential blockbuster thriller, driven by marvelous performances, a polished, intelligent adaptation from the best-selling novel, stupendous cinematography, and a first-rate musical score.  Highly respected in the movie-making industry, the film is one of the few true horror/thrillers to ever win the Best Picture Academy Award (1991).  Tailored from Thomas Harris's incredibly popular novel with an unforgettably astute screenplay, "Silence of the Lambs" lunges into a world of madness, dread, and cannibalism never seen before on the big screen and is portrayed by director Jonathan Demme ("Philadelphia") in near-perfect fashion.<br /><br />Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster, in her best role since "Taxi Driver") is just a regular, hard-nosed wannabe FBI trainee-agent looking for her shot at the big time when she is summoned into the office of her boss, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), for a special task.  An unattainable, sex-demented serial killer (Ted Levine) who preys on obese women and whose media-given title as "Buffalo Bill" is still on the loose and is striking with an escalating frequency that Crawford will go to any lengths to get some answers.  When the daughter (Brooke Smith) of a successful politician shows up missing, the FBI feels amplified pressure to crack the case.  Crawford suggests to Starling that she investigate the matter by profiling a similar cannibalistic serial killer named Hannibal Lecter (performed perfectly by the talented Anthony Hopkins), who is now located at a maximum security prison and knows the ins and outs of the notorious Buffalo Bill.  As Clarice learns more and more about the anomalous killer from the horrific Lecter, she also has to confront her own inner demons in order to save future victims.<br /><br />"The Silence of the Lambs" is superbly directed by Demme, who uses the camera as a painting canvas to illuminate the horrors that the human mind can produce, mixing spine-tingling close-ups, many accented long-shots, and one famous "night-vision" sequence to enhance the eerie ambiance.  Foster is truly brilliant, showing true performing range as a mixture of woman determinism and psychological sprite in search of internal peace.  Hopkins is shockingly delightful as the tongue-in-cheek maniac with a sly sense of humor, a mesmerizing lisp, and one intense thirst for human blood.  The screenplay adaptation by Ted Tally is pin-point and meticulously designed to pay homage to the exceptional novel, capturing the essence of the troubled young FBI agent and the sexual perplexity of our film's main antagonist.  A genuinely transfixing classic.  One of the finest of its kind-ever.</p></body></html>

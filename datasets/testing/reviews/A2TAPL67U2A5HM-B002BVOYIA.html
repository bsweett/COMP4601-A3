<meta name="summary" content="Hotel Rwanda"></head><body><p>Hotel Rwanda directed Terry George is an extremely powerfull movie which depicts the ethnic cleansings that occured in Rwanda. The violence and cruelty is beyond imagination and I must say that I was deeply disturbed by the fact that Europe, United States did nothing to prevent this from happening. The script is extremely well written and the actors are astounding in their respective roles. There were several times, that I simply had to look away from the screen since I could never fathom the inhumanity and the brutality. One would have thought that the world would have learned something from genocides in Cambodia, and the balkans. But it seems the old adage still rings true, that the more things change, the more they stay the same. This is a movie that should not be missed since it is one of the most powerfull and disturbing movies that I have ever viewed.</p></body></html>

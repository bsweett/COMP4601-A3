<meta name="summary" content="INTERESTING, INTELLIGENT NON-STOP ACTION SPY THRILLER..."></head><body><p>This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book "The Bourne Identity". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.<br /><br />The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural "Bourne" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.<br /><br />Matt Damon, looking very buff, portrays Bourne as an intelligent, resourceful character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them. Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.<br /><br />This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale. Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre. This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.</p></body></html>

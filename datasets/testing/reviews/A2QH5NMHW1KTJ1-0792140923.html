He is in love with a girl name Jenny Curran (Robin Wright Penn ) who is Forest's friend, but just likes him as a friend. He's known her ever since they were little. She then moves on in war and peace marches of the Vietnam War, which then leads Forrest to go to fight in the Vietnam War. His friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) gets killed and Forrest promises to help Bubba's family with the mortgages. He then meets Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who gets his legs blown off in the war. Which then loses his money and Forrest invests with him in a fishing business. Forest then sadly loses his mother by a fight against basically old age. Jenny then comes back to his life and realizes he has a kid. Jenny then loses a fight with a bad cold which then dies. A very sad film with Forrest Gump has to move on.<p>It is a very sad tragic movie that can really move you. It can be very touching, which can make you drop a tear. It is very moving which if you haven't seen you got to watch this film. It is a must see if you haven't. I don't really think it should have won best picture, I liked it but I liked Pulp Fiction better. Tom Hanks's performance is very great and truly deserved the Oscar. It also can be very heart warming in a sensitive way. The cinematography in this film is very breath taking. It can blow your mind. This movie can touch anyone and when you stop watching this film, it's just a feeling you can't explain.<p>This DVD includes commentary by Robert Zemeckis, Steve Starkey and Rick Carter, but it would have been better if they had commentary by Tom Hanks. It also has behind the scenes, art design featurattes. This is a 2 disc set DVD, and widescreen. It also has the trailer and TV spots of the film. It also has interviews with the cast and crew. With Tom Hanks, Robert Zemeckis and more. This could have had better features though like the backstory they had on AMC. Other than that these special features are pretty good. You have to get this film or if you haven't seen it you need to watch this spectacular film. A definite must.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="4 1/2 stars, and it's not just in my head.."></head><body><p>IDENTITY DVD: Last night I popped in this DVD, first I was givin' the option of WIDESCREEN or FULLSCREEN. I choose WIDESCREEN. Second I was givin' the option of THEATRICAL CUT or EXTENDED VERSION. I choose EXTENDED. It would be nice if all DVD's had these options. Director James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted &amp; Copland) whips up the perfect crowed pleaser for horror/suspense fans. The movie delivers a chilling atmoshere. It's dark and rainy, a motel setting in an abandoned area. Eventually the cast comes together at the motel, where one by one they are found murdered and evenually they disappear. It's part slasher film, part who-done-it. Basically IDENTITY is a horror movie with a psycological twist. And by my star rating above you can see I enjoyed it. I did however wonder why the DVD isn't in DTS?? IDENTITY stars: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Pruitt Taylor Vance, &amp; Rebecca DeMornay. DVD INCLUDES: Widescreen or Fullscreen / Alternative Ending and Additional scene / Commentary / Deleted Scenes / On the set of IDENTITY / Filmographies / &amp; more.</p></body></html>

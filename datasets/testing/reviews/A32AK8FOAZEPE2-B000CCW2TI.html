<meta name="summary" content="not bad, but with lot of sloppy leaks"></head><body><p>the young actress is one of the most talented young actors and a good news to the movie viewers. she's a very enjoyable image. but there are lot of big holes and bad leaks in this not-bad movie:<br /><br />1)the scene she carelessly watched directly at the camera didn't delete.<br /><br />2)there is no immediate response when the young girl reported to the stewardess that a man got into the restroom where a woman was already inside. what kind of training that stewardess really got?<br /><br />3)the 911 operator and police responding times were both ridiculously long<br /><br />4)so after the rocket blast, no one questioned her and just took for granted? nobody questioned her why she changed the room? and the victim just came up to her and said 'thanks'?<br /><br />5)yeah, in order to make the young psycho looked bad, you just casted a young man who looked so obviously like psycho and still made the heroine like to talk to him in the airport? that guy's goofy and spooky face would turn every normal woman right away from him, albeit talking to him, having a drink with him, and didn't try to change seat right away. a terrible casting mistake.<br /><br />6)did you ever open yourself up and confess so much of your personal life to a stranger, a fellow traveler, just because he coincidentally seated next to you?<br /><br />there were so many loose ends that just didn't sell, yet the director and the editor simply did nothing and let them go.<br /><br />without the best choice and good performance of this young actress, the movie actually sucks big time!</p></body></html>

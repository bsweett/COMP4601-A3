<meta name="summary" content="I'd break up with him too!"></head><body><p>The Break-Up starring Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston is an unfunny, boring, and tepid film. The only reason I am giving this film two stars instead of one is because Aniston has never disappointed me acting wise. For me, she has never given a bad performance no matter how terrible the script was. Vaughn on the other hand is so annoying in this, he's just a bad actor - I don't understand what Aniston saw in him off-screen? He has no appeal and you just want to punch him in the face! I just hated the lame premise, there was no point to this film - such a waste of time. Bravo to Aniston for keeping me half interested.</p></body></html>

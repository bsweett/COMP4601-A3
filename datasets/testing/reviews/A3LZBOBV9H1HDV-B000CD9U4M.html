Johnny Depp is eccentricly brilliant as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore is an impressive Charlie Bucket. Tim Burton's directing is excellent. The visual effects are impressive and Oscar-worthy. The screenplay by John August, based on the novel by Roald Dahl, is excellent. The music by Danny Elfman is excellent and stays with you even after the movie is over. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is excellent and remarkable. The film editing by Chris Lebenzon is excellent. The casting by Susie Figgis is excellent. The production design by Alex McDowell is impressive and a feast for the eyes. It is also Oscar-worthy, as well. The art direction by Francois Audouy, Sean Haworth, James Lewis, Andy Nicholson, Kevin Phipps (senior art director), Stuart Rose, and Leslie Tomkins is also impressive and a feast for the eyes and is Oscar-worthy, as well. The set decoration by Peter Young is just as impressive and is also a feast for the eyes and is also Oscar-worthy, as well. The costume design (Oscar nominated) by Gabriella Pescucci is excellent. This is one of the year's best! It is also an excellent remake to the original "Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory" (1971), as well.</p></body></html>

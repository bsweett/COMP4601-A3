The cast led by Kevin Costner (as Earl Brooks), Demi Moore (as Detective Tracy Atwood), Dane Cook (as Mr. Smith), and William Hurt (as Marshall) is excellent. The interactions between Costner and Hurt is interesting to watch. The directing by Bruce A. Evans is great. The story and screenplay by Evans & Raynold Gideon (both who wrote the screenplay to "Stand By Me" (1986) is great. The music by Ramin Djawadi (who also composes the music to the tv show "Prison Break") is great. The cinematography by John Lindley (who also did the cinematography to the upcoming "Reservation Road" (2007) is great. The film editing by Miklos Wright (who also did the film editing to "Open Range" (2003), & "3000 Miles To Graceland" (2001), both which starred Costner) is great. The casting by Mindy Marin (who also did the casting to "Open Range" & "The Postman" (1997), both which was directed and starred Costner) is great. The production design by Jeffrey Beecroft (who also did the production design to "Message In A Bottle" (1999), "The Bodyguard" (1992), "Dances With Wolves" (1990), which also starred Costner) is great. The art direction by William Ladd Skinner (who also did the art direction to "The Bodyguard", "Dances With Wolves", also did the art direction to "Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End" (2007) & the upcoming "I Am Legend" (2007) is great. The set decoration by Anne Kuljian is great. The costume design by Judianna Makovsky (who also did the costume design to the upcoming "National Treasure: Book Of Secrets" (2007) & its prequel, "National Treasure" (2004) is great. This is an interesting thriller that keeps you guessing and thinking at the same time. This is an excellent change of pace for Costner and he should do it more often.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="4 stars for the film itself, 1 star for the bonus footage"></head><body><p>Let me say right off the bat that Spider-Man 2 was a great film the way it was!<br /><br />While Spider-Man 2.1 didn't damage its original predecessor, it didn't add much to it either. Of the new scenes, the only ones that were significant in my view is where Mary Jane Watson discusses her impending marriage to John Jameson with a girlfriend and the added footage of the fights between Spidey and Dr. Octopus, especially on the train! The others were okay BUT weren't really missed.<br /><br />Overall, I still enjoy the new version nonetheless. Worth the money but I'd find it at a lower price than what's there right now.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NOT A USUAL FILM"></head><body><p>Nowdays when somebody talks of some unexpected plot twist in the ending "The Sixth Sense" is being mentioned. But before were "The Usual Suspects"... It seems that I know this movie like the palm of my hand but every time I watch the ending shivers are running down my spine. And every time I think: "How couldn't I guess?.."<br /><br />Nowdays everyone talks about how Hollywood unlearned to make movies for smart audience, that all it does now are some stupid, comics-like, PG-13 flicks. I read some review lately and author was saying something like this: "C'mon Hollywood, wake up, people are not that brainless". So here's the answer I think - "The Usual Suspects" - really clever and shrewd film. Bryan Singer did a wonderful job here maybe because he was young and unknown. Later he released "Apt Pupil" - also smart movie, and then... "X-Men", "X2", now he's filming "Superman returns" - well, it's Hollywood after all :) Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson and many others once also were making independent interesting cinema... But it's not the point here. As I said "The Usual Suspects" is a smart and intelligent film and those like it are in deficit now. Screenplay is awesome (and it deserved its Oscar), directing is beyond praise, acting Ensemble is like no other: Spacy (Academy Award too), Byrne, Baldwin, Palminteri, Del Toro, Pollak, Hedaya... God, what a cast! You will definately enjoy watching them play.<br /><br />"The Usual Suspects" is one of the best thrillers ever made, you'll never regret buying it for your collection plus the special edition has many interesting bonus features. I was never more sure giving a movie five stars.</p></body></html>

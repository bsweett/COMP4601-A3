<meta name="summary" content="The Others  (2001)"></head><body><p>Director:  Alejandro Amenabar<br /><br />Cast:  Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Alakina Mann, James Bentley, Eric Sykes, Elaine Cassidy, Renee Asherson, Gordon Reid, Keith Allen, Michelle Fairley.<br /><br />Running Time:  104 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and frightening moments.<br /><br />In the critically acclaimed "The Others", Nicole Kidman is Grace, an emphatically religious woman, devoted to her two creepy children, who appear to be afflicted with a severe sensitivity to light, so much so that they can not handle anything more than candlelight (which conveniently allows for lots of dark atmosphere to occupy the film). Every door in her huge, cavernous Victorian mansion off the coast of England must be closed and locked before the next can be opened, in order to prevent any light from leaking into a room where her children may be. Grace's husband is off fighting in World War II, which, strangely has just come to an end when the film opens. Of course, the audience can pretty much deduce that the poor guy has died during battle. Out of nowhere enter three domestic servants, apparently arriving to replace the previous three domestic servants who have abruptly and mysteriously disappeared one week earlier.  Things seem to be going along rather smoothly: servants tending to the house and kids (especially the bratty daughter, played to spine-tingly perfection by Alakina Mann) and Grace frantically opening and closing doors. Then doors open by themselves, curtains, once drawn, are oddly pulled back with no one in the room to do so, Grace and her kids (mostly the daughter) start hearing weird noises that seem to indicate the presence of others in the house. Ghosts? Maybe, but Grace will hear none of that nonsense. She just keeps telling her kids to shut up and stop lying to her about the noises.  Obviously, these noises aren't the imagination of the children and Grave soon learns that some her biggest fears are now a reality.<br /><br />Co-produced by Tom Cruise (Kidman's husband at the time) and filmed in Spain with an international cast, "The Others" marked the English-language debut of Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar, previously responsible for such high profile Spanish entries as "Thesis" and "Open Your Eyes". Amen&aacute;bar's film aspires to Jamesian sophistication, rejecting bombast for subtlety at every turn, as Kidman's troubled heroine struggles to identify the source of her supernatural experiences (are they real, or just a figment of her overheated imagination?). Kidman is too young for the role, and lacks the necessary gravitas, but she plays it with a fair degree of brittle dignity, particularly in her scenes with Mann, the most confrontational of her children, who is either a malicious prankster intent on frightening her younger brother with manufactured ghost stories, or is genuinely in contact with something sinister lurking within the house.  Like "The Sixth Sense" before it, "The Others" prides itself on a series of climactic 'revelations', some of which tip their hand too early, but Amen&aacute;bar's screenplay has more than a few surprises in store, especially on second viewing, when the multilayered dialogue is revealed as a masterful patchwork of irony and misdirection. Stage actress Fionnula Flanagan is appropriately enigmatic as Kidman's stoical housekeeper, and there's strong support from Christopher Eccleston and veteran comedian Eric Sykes (here playing it very straight indeed). Beautiful, atmospheric sets by Benjam&iacute;n Fern&aacute;ndez, photographed with exquisite grace by Javier Aguirresarobe.<br /><br />With "The Others", Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. The actors who play Grace's children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent.  "The Others" is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. "The Others" takes its time to get to its reveal, and for the most part it is worth every minute.</p></body></html>

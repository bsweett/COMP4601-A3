<meta name="summary" content="Let's Confuse Doom with Resident Evil shall we?"></head><body><p>This movie is not based upon the popular Doom games at all.  It does have the UAC, it does have the BFG 9000 and it does have blood and gore...but this isn't Doom.  In the game, the monsters came from hell and are not borrowed from Resident Evil.  In the game, there's no mention of a "super being" ever being on Mars.  In the game, they didn't experiment on people to produce a "super being".  The idea of experiments changing people into monsters comes from Resident Evil and not Doom.  Do NOT confuse Doom with Resident Evil and do not make a movie of it.  The movie is more based on Resident Evil than it is on Doom.  And The Rock should be embrassed being in a movie that's NOT base on the game of the same name.</p></body></html>

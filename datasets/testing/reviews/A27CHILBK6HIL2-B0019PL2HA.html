<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Summer Comedy That Shows How Sacha Baron Cohen Is One Of The Most Versitile Comedians Out There"></head><body><p>MOVIE: Will Ferrell is probably the most bankable comedian working in film right now. Anchorman was a huge success and it a pretty funny movie as well. Here we have a movie about a NASCAR driver and his journey to the top. The movie is funny and it has all the Ferrell antics we've come to expect. However, I really felt like Will Ferrell wasn't that funny in the movie. It was his costars that made the film enjoyable, and even then it wasn't as funny as his previous ones. John C. Reilly is an incredible comedic actor, and he displays that here in the movie. The show is stolen by Sacha Baron Cohen who plays eccentric French Formula "oohn" driver, Jean Gerrard. The man is one of the most talented comedians ever to grace the screen, and he truly makes the film what it is. Will Ferrell may have you rolling when he sticks a knife in his leg, but the show's one-liners come from Cohen.<br /><br />ACTING: As I stated earlier, Ferrell and Reilly are extremely funny and talented, but Sacha Baron Cohen steals the spotlight. I laughed the hardest at his character just because he did such a perfect job. People will recognize Cohen as Ali G and Borat, as well as King Julian from Madagascar. The man is extremely veristile and he can transform into anything. Would you have guessed he's from Great Britain?<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A fun summer fare that will be one of those movies you pop in every now and then for a quick laugh. It's nowhere near as funny or clever as Anchorman, Zoolander, or the other comedies that the Stiller/Wilson/Ferrell team has offered.</p></body></html>

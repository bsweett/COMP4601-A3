<meta name="summary" content="What a ressuscitation !"></head><body><p>Don't think this is a masterpiece of ecological, political or cultural thinking. Certainly not but it is a good entertainment, even if the editing could have been slightly more dynamic at times. They have dared ressuscitate him, like the simple comic strip character he used to be. They suddenly remembered that he would not be the first one. Sherlock Holmes was ressuscitated by Conan Doyle. Aliens were ressuscitated for a fourth episode. Even Harry Potter will be ressuscitated in a few years by Ms Rowling after she has has him killed in billions of various sufferings and ordeals. They also say that Jesus started in a way the literary trick for the second episode of the Bible, the New Testament, which became a real bestseller since then. What's more, they're even preparing the next episode by grooming the next generation. Yes, indeed, Superman had left a child, a son, behind him when he left last time he was around. And the son promises : he kills a gangster by knocking him down with a grand, a very grand piano. The bad man, Luthor, is back too, just out of prison, not the man in black like with Stephen King, but a man in white to cultivate differences in a way. And he even finishes his carrier the same way as in `The Stand', though in this case there is no savage he can start preaching and manipulating on this desert island. It is really funny at times, and very emotional when our Superman manages to save a whole family in one single flight. Of course you may wonder if the world really needs a saviour, a new Jesus. Even if you are a Christian Born Again you may have doubts about it, especially if you see the mess some of them Christians Born Again create as soon as they open their mouths. Note the only emergency number they do not dial in this film is 911. We understand why since they try to destroy the whole city in one single attack. That would have been a little bit too simple. A good summer film for this hot season when we can go around without any shirt nor any pants on, at times even without any shoes. Superman will keep you cool even if his human girlfriend had forgotten the heat of his body. You're not obliged to come too close.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne</p></body></html>

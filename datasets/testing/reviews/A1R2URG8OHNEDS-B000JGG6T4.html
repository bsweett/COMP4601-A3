<meta name="summary" content="Denzel Washington Gives a Powerful Preformance!"></head><body><p>I was not planning on seeing "Man on Fire," but after reading the reviews for it, I decided to go check it out. I was pleased with the outcome. The movie was sad, action-packed, always interesting, and greatly acted. The film stars Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, Dakota Fanning, and Radha Mitchell. In brief, "Man on Fire" is about a man who is the bodyguard of a young girl, and when she is kidnapped, he will stop at nothing to get her back, and find the people who did it, and kill them. But it is much more than that. It is a look at the affect that people could have on others, and a look at corruption, greed, and other things that could kill a man's spirit. At a running time of 146 minutes, "Man on Fire" is an epic look into what a man would do to save another person.<p>Denzel Washington plays John Creasy. He has just been hired to be the bodyguard to young Pita, the daughter of Samuel and Lisa Ramos, after his friend Rayburn convinced them to interview him for the job. Creasy has a drinking problem, and he tells this to Samuel before getting the job. Pita thinks that Creasy is a friend, a point that he tells her after too much friendly talk. The two eventually bond when she asks for help from him for her swimming races. Then, a problem occurs. While waiting for her to finish her piano lession, corrupt Mexican cops, and other people come and kidnap her, wounding Creasy, and leaving him under arrest for the murder of two cops. Mexican investigator Miguel Manzano knows that Creasy did not kill the cops, and with the help of him and news reporter Mariana, Creasy goes off to find revenge on the people who kidnapped Pita, and who is now reported dead.<p>"Man on Fire" is not a great film, but it is very entertaining and includes some powerful preformances. Denzel Washington should be nominated for an Oscar from his preformance as John Creasy, and in some scenes young Dakota Fanning steals some of the scenes from him. In reguard to the twist at the end, I did not see anything coming. It is an epic that does not actually feel long. I would see "Man on Fire" again, but I don't recommend it to all. There is some gritty, dark violence, but that is not a problem. The problem is the way the film is shot. It is always moving around, and that got a little annoying at some times. Otherwise, this was a really good film.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for language and strong violence.</p></body></html>

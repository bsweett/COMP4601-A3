<meta name="summary" content="Cuban Gangster Soap Opera Starring Al Pacino"></head><body><p>Scarface exists on it's own terms - as a cautionary tale about a Cuban punk who arrives in Miami in 1980 and works his way to the top of the Cocaine power-heap, but it also begs comparison to Al Pacino's other work as that other famous gangster - Michael Corleone in the Godfather films.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's screenplay forms the foundation for Brian De Palma's film, and the violence and language are exceedingly raw.  This is not a film for the easily offended.  In fact, you could have a pretty strong stomach for excess violence and the F word and still be a little worn out by the end.<br /><br />Pacino's Anthony Montana has no redeeming qualities.  He has all the deadly sins, and double doses of most of them.  Where The Godfather's Michael Corleone is a conflicted character, Tony is sociopath through and through.  Michael Corleone begins the Godfather movies with no intention of getting involved in the family "business", and by the end he has become one of the strongest gangsters on earth.  He dreams of "going legitimate" and at various points in ALL of the Godfather films Michael ponders his place in the crime universe and how he can separate his life of crime from his family - who he seems to legitimately love.  Tony Montana in "Scarface" has NO ambition of going straight - only of becoming a MORE powerful druglord.  He treats women and his friends like dirt and walks through life with an arrogance that is, at best, unpleasant.  When he is REALLY riled he is capable of just about anything, and this film shows his character doing pretty much that - just about anything.<br /><br />De Palma's direction is a cut above average, and the cast of Pacino, Pfeiffer and some excellent support from Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Steven Bauer perform their roles adequately, but by the end I couldn't get over the feeling that I was essentially watching an extremely violent soap opera with a good cast.<br /><br />I'd say about 3.5 stars, but I'll round it to 4.</p></body></html>

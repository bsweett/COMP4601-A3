<meta name="summary" content="Creepy, macabre folk tale with a Tim Burton twist..."></head><body><p>Tim Burton, gothic mastermind behind Frankenweenie, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow, once again brings his dark, deliciously twisted sense of humor to the screen, this time in a retelling of a Russian Jewish folk tale.  I had the chance to see a prescreening of the film on campus before it was released, and greatly enjoyed the film.<br /><br />The Corpse Bride is a tale based partly on reality - reality that in centuries past, anti-Semitic Russians would ambush Jewish wedding parties, murder the bride, and bury her in her dress, where she is found by a groom-to-be, who jokingly places the ring on her bony finger, thus binding her to him as a corpse bride.<br /><br />Burton has moved the tale from Russia to Victorian England. Victor, voiced by the ever-charming Johnny Depp, is clumsy and nervous, and can't seem to get his wedding vows straight to Victoria at the rehearsal. After a series of disastrous encounters with his in-laws (including nearly torching his mother-in-law with a wedding candle), he flees in desperation to the nighttime woods, where he practices until he learns his vows, culminating in his placing the ring on a gnarled tree branch, which in reality is the ring finger of the Corpse Bride.<br /><br />Victor is sucked down into her dark underworld, populated by cannonball-riddled generals, Peter Lorre-like maggots, a Ray Charles skeletal impersonator, and Victorian skeleton children in sailor suits and dresses, and must devise a plan to return to "up there" and rescue his love Victoria from her evil parents and the slimy Lord Barkis. I won't ruin the ending for you; you'll have to see this one for yourself.<br /><br />Danny Elfman, frequent Burton collaborator (Nightmare Before Christmas, Sleepy Hollow), is at the musical helm here, with typical Elfman embellishments of chimes, bells, and vocals. Part of the problem was the speakers used at our screening; the voices sounded fine, but the musical numbers were very distorted and I couldn't make out the lyrics.<br /><br />The stop-motion puppets and sets are absolutely gorgeous and stunning in their level of detail. It speaks favorably of Tim's determination to use an old-fashioned special effects technique rather than animating the film in 3D, which doubtless would have been easier, but after his previous success with Nightmare Before Christmas, I can understand why he'd want to return to the medium.<br /><br />This one might be too scary and macabre for young children; it is not as child-friendly (!) as the Nightmare Before Christmas. Although it will likely be a Halloween hit (I honestly can't see the film doing well at a release at any other time than Halloween, as its appeal is strictly Halloween/ horror-oriented), this will not appeal to many "traditional" moviegoers. Although it does not contain sex, nudity, or profanity, it is full of Burton's graphic images of death (skeletons, internal organs, maggots, decaying corpses), talking skeletons, and dead-bodily humor.<br /><br />A haunting flick sure to entertain this ghostly Halloween, and fans of Burton's earlier work won't want to miss the Corpse Bride.</p></body></html>

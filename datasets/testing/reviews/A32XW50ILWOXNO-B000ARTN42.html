Braddock, the hero of "Cinderella Man," based on the unlikely comeback of the small heavyweight whose career was left for dead, then reclaimed. "Rocky" seems to have inspired this movie, despite it being based on a true story - specifically in the depiction of the heavyweight champion at the time, Max Baer. Director Ron Howard is aiming for Oscars - the movie's too simple and handsome for that. But it is a winner, and the boxing scenes are suprisingly lucid and fierce.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is Braddock, a flinty, good-natured Irishman who lost his boxing winnings in the Depression and was reduced to a one-room apartment and the daily 5 a.m. walk to the docks for a handful of shifts. Some days you get picked, some days you don't, and when the state of New York revokes his boxing license for, in essence, being a tomato can, poverty zeroes in on him, his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and their three kids.<br /><br />Abject poverty is dark, cold, long, boring, humbling and quiet.  Howard directs the scenes inside the apartment like a one-act play; it's about the most restraint he's ever shown in his career. The same goes for a possible tearjerker inside the trainer's club at Madison Square Garden, where Braddock, broke, holds out his hat for dollar bills. Begging is like the docks. Some give. Some don't.<br /><br />The second - and better - half of "Cinderella Man" charts Braddock's comeback, which begins with a one-fight farewell against heavyweight contender Corn Griffin. Braddock has switched styles - he suddenly has a left hook - and he uses his decent speed to get inside his larger opponents and go to work. They're some of the best boxing scenes ever filmed, both in visceral impact and intellectual depth - a strength is to use Braddock's trainer (Paul Giamatti, in a role that suits his extroverted nature) as a means of bluntly explaining fight strategy - "fill his face with blood" -  in a way that stirs us while deepening our understanding of the ring.<br /><br />This is rare - consider Rocky's various trainers speak mostly "go get em" nonsense, little-to-nothing is said in "Ali," and "Million Dollar Baby" isn't really about boxing anyway. When Braddock finally fights Baer(Craig Bierko), we understand why Baer is fearsome, how Braddock beats him, and how titanic a victory it was to outpoint the guy over 15 rounds. Surely Baer is not quite the talky villain the movie makes him out to be - this is where "Rocky" seems to be the influence - and the fight includes about 200 more landed punches than there actually was, but this is surely more exciting than the climactic fight in "Ali," if not as artistic.<br /><br />"Cinderella Man" is not quite as dramatic in its smaller moments - in one of those "the way it was" subplots, it attempts to articulate the anger of the Depression through one of Braddock's dock buddies (Paddy Considine), a mouthy stock-broker-turned-union-man. It's just a big shoehorn. And while I'm sure Zellweger wanted to work opposite Crowe, she is cute and plucky and supportive to a fault, and has been in a bunch of roles, and it's getting a little old. Howard photographs her and the kids like dolls-as-street-urchins.<br /><br />The boxing material - even the early tomato can fight - redeems the soft spots. Much more than "Million Dollar Baby," "Cinderella Man" marinates in the romance of the sport, bloody and unforgiving as it is. At the end of Braddock's brawl with Baer, it's not just an emotional payoff, but a satisfaction - this movie knows the reward of a good</p></body></html>

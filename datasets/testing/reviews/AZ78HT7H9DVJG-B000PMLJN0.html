<meta name="summary" content="a ventriloquist horror movie...oh please!"></head><body><p>There's just some topics that should be left alone and people should not attempt to make them into movies.  The ventriloquist/dummy "horror" movie is one of them.  I remember seeing something similar to this movie as a kid.  I just cannot recall the title of that movie.<br /><br />Anyways, Jamie Ashen returns to his childhood hometown, Raven's Fair, after his wife was mysteriously murdered.  She was murdered almost immediately after the couple has received an anonymous mail at their doorstep, which contained a dummy.<br /><br />Jamie soon learns that the dummy, Billy, is a product of a dead ventriloquist, Mary Shaw.  Mary Shaw was murdered some years ago after the townspeople suspected her of murdering a young boy who doubted her ventriloquist talent.  Her tongue was ripped out and she was buried with her "children", all 101 of her dummies.<br /><br />However, these days, her dummies are coming back from the grave.  The question is why?  Who is behind these mysterious murders?  Mary Shaw?  Jamie and a local police detective (Wahlberg) must locate the mastermind or at least try to locate the curse and break it to stop the killings.<br /><br />It sounds like a great movie after reading the jacket of the DVD cover.  However, the story plot is forgettable.  The acting...no comment.  If you're just bored and just want anything to entertain you, then you just might like the movie.  Otherwise, you're not missing anything if you don't watch this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No Longer Scary"></head><body><p>The Exorcist is no longer scary, disturbing or suspenseful. Tubular Bells is played for all of maybe 45 seconds the whole movie. The language is mild compared to even yesterday's pro wrestling, but the hokey gore etc. during the once horrifying demonic possession scenes are still there. The spider walk scene lasts maybe 10 seconds. The whole movie is maybe two hours long. Yes, it is Christian propaganda but it has appeared to have mellowed with age. This is abolutely nothing compared to even Night of the Demons 2, the last movie that genuinely unnerved me. As a Christian drama about demonic possession it's nearly a masterpiece, but like my pastor said, you can take a 76 Chevy, paint it, and it'll still be a 76 Chevy. Meaning here- what was scary as hell in the 70s hardly raises and eyebrow today even with a measly 11 minutes of added footage. Oh, and the prequel Dominion was bad. But still I liked it as a Christian drama. The horror isn't there any more.</p></body></html>

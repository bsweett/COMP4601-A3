That said, on my most recent viewing, the following things caught my eye and made me realize IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE would have NEVER been made today:<br />1) The police try to shoot George for hitting one of them. Talk about police brutality!<br />2) In George's alternate life, we find that Mary had the very worst possible thing happen to her: she became an old maid!. Her eyesight aapparently also suffered from this as she ended up wearing glasses too.<br />3) George and Clarence get thrown out of a bar for talking about 200 year old angels. Those Potterville bars sure had high standards for their drunken patron's conversations!<br />4) I would also question George's sanity for letting Uncle Billy handle a $8,000 deposit which I'm guessing would represent somewhere around $200,000 of today.<br />5) The simple, even naive way the movie starts with the stars speaking to one other. There you can also hear someone praying to "Jesus, Mary and Joseph". I bet somebody would attack that for being "un-politically correct" these days.<br />I also noticed for the first time that with all the heavy snowing when George is on the bridge, not a single flake actually sticks to his clothes; Harry's hat in his final scene also seems to be refrigerated as the snow on it stays while that on his shoulders melts. The Christmas decoration switching on and off his arm when he talks to Harry long distance is also very funny.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="engrossing look at the life of Emperor Penguins....."></head><body><p>I was so glad when I finally got to see this film!  MARCH OF PENGUINS earned well-deserved acclaim for its depiction of the plight of the Emperor Penguin, every year, as they march across Antarctica, to arrive on breeding grounds, to mate and further the species.  It is beautifully filmed and soulfully narrated by actor Morgan Freeman.  You will fall in love with the young penguins and grow very attached to the older ones, leading them to their destination.  It takes a year for this brood of birds to reach their destination.  That means enduring freezing temperatures, as well as staying clear of the advances of their predators.  You're going to want to watch this from start to finish, just to see what happens.<br /><br />This film earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Documentary, and is an engaging study in the lives of these extraordinary birds.  You'll never look at penguins the same way, I guarantee it.</p></body></html>

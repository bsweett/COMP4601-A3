If you're looking for serious and realistic movie that's meant to give you a debate on big brother government and terrorist tactics, then go get 'The Bourne Ultimatum.' This movie on the other hand is a tense action thriller that keeps you guessing, and some true jaw-dropping scenes. It's almost non-stop movement, and it's movement that keeps you on your edge. Make no mistake about it, Eagle Eye is an action thriller.<br /><br />Story-wise, Shia LaBeouf is a slacker that works in a 'Copy Cabana,' who strives for independence, even though he's not very good at it. Michelle Monaghan is a somewhat happy single mother who just sent her son of to play trumpet at the Lincoln Center. Then all the sudden, Julianne Moore calls them their cellphones, and even gives directions on random TV and various other electronic screens, and she won't take voicemail or no for an answer. As it turns out, she does not want pizza, but rather intends to guide them to Washington DC to carry out an elaborate conspiracy. Oh, did I mention some anti-terrorist government officials are after them?<br /><br />On its surface, the premise of Eagle Eye is actually quite compelling, and keeps your attention throughout the movie. It's only about 3/4s through I started noticing it shared some similarities to Will Smith's 'I-Robot.' In either case, while some parts may be original, the overall story really isn't, but again, this isn't the type of movie you dissect like that. Sure, it calls into question terrorism methods, and spying, but that's not the point of the movie. The point of the movie is to have a good time. And not to give too much away, I'd rather Shia's character kick the bucket at the end, sacrificing his life, as it could have made for a strong movie all the way around.<br /><br />But overall, Eagle Eye is a great popcorn flick, and a conspiracy action thriller. The cast does a great job, the crew does a nice job, the story keeps you interested, and the action is jaw-dropping sequence after sequence. Rent it, buy it, it's a great watch. Just don't over-think it.</p></body></html>

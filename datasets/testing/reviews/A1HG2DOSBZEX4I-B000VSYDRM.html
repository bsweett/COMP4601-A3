With that said I feel that Tom Tykwer has done an admirable job in bringing Patrick Suskind's unfilmable (to use Kubrick's words) novel to the screen.<br /><br />The film follows Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), an outcast with an incredible sense of smell throught 18th Century Paris. Grenouille uses his gift in order to find recognition and possibly even love and acceptance from those around him. Unfortunately he does it in the wrong way, he becomes a serial killer obsessed with making the perfect perfume. This perfume being created from the distilled essence of virgins.<br /><br />Along the way he is apprenticed to master perfumer Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman)who teaches him his craft and starts Grenouille on his macabre journey. There is also some fine acting on display from Alan Rickman as Richis the father of Grenouille's final victim.<br /><br />This is a film that relies heavily on its production design (Uli Hanisch) and its cinematography (Franke Griebe) in order to make the viewer feel and smell the sights and sounds of a filthy urban sprawl that was 18th century Paris. The novel was deemed unfilmable because it was thought that no film could capture this feel. Tykwer did a very good job even if the film is a little overlong for its own good. While the plot may not stand up to close scrutiny it does provide an interesting few hours in the dark. Many have commented on the strange ending but I feel that the ending helps the film reach its ultimate resolution. All said maybe the recognition that we seek is not what is in our best interests after all.<br /><br />This is a provacative and intelligent horror film that many missed on its theatrical release. Give it a try. You may be glad you did for the acting and design alone.</p></body></html>

One night, tragedy strikes the act; Angier's wife dies on stage and Borden is blamed.  The two strike out on their own, each gaining in reputation while trying to destroy the other.  Borden gets a wife, child, and mistress (Scarlett Johansson), while Angier goes to scientist Tesla (David Bowie) in search of the ultimate illusion.<br /><br />This film is often compared with "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQ4">The Illusionist</a>,"  which is also about a performing magician at the turn of the 20th century, but this movie isn't nearly as good.  The actors do their job (Caine and Johansson are the best; Bale has an oddly 21st century hair cut) and the period is recreated nicely, but I didn't care about or like anyone.  The story  was endlessly confusing, and ultimately based on something that is impossible.  The reveal makes you say, "Oh," instead of "OH!"  Dialogue is often mumbled, and I wasn't even sure of the two main characters' names for a long time.  Their appearance and personalities are too similar; neither stands out as a "hero."  It would have been much better had it been told chronologically, but scenes are in random order, which is irritating.  We know the ending from the beginning, so there is no build-up of tension and the magic isn't fun.  Disappointing.</p></body></html>

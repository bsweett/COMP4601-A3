<meta name="summary" content="Very Entertaining and Frightening at the same time!"></head><body><p>Moore presents a very serious issue facing all Americans whether or not they have health insurance in a very entertaining light.  If what he presents is true, then the American public has been lied to especially concerning "socialized" medicine in other countries.<br /><br />During the documentary Moore went to four countries including Cuba and he expounds that medicine in these places is far superior to what is available or not available to the American public here in the US.  The documentary opens a lot of questions that demand answers, even if what is presented as "fact" is not quite "fact."<br /><br />Excellently presented!</p></body></html>

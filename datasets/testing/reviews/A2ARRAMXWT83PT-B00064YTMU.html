<meta name="summary" content="One of Tom Cruise's best performances in an altogether riveting film."></head><body><p>Lately, Tom Cruise has been getting on everyone's nerves, and it is easy to see why. He's been a little kooky for the past few years and it has been very annoying...however, I have to say that none of that has tarnished the fact that he is a fantastic actor, and this film is proof of that statement...well, this and "Magnolia" of course.<br /><br />I recently revisited "Collateral" over the weekend, and I have to say that Tom Cruise delivers what I think is an Oscar-worthy performance as a contract killer named Vincent, who gives a New York taxi driver - a superb Jamie Foxx - the ride of his life. You all know the plot by now, so there is no point getting into it here. All that you need to know is that the film boasts some excellent scenery, dialogue, and a pretty cool film score. Michael Mann is at the top of his game here. He manages to inject that "Miami Vice" feel into all of his work, and it just comes off as incredilbly awesome.<br /><br />The thing that I love about this film is that it doesn't succomb to the conventional "lets blow crap up" attitude of it's genre. It's an intelligent thriller with a considerable amount of character development, and of course, there are times where suspension of disbelief is required, but not to the point where you are rolling your eyes. I usually avoid action films like the plague, but this is the exception as it does more than offer you boom booms and bang bangs.<br /><br />SEE IT, if you have not already.</p></body></html>

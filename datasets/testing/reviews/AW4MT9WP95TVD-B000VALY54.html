Dark, comic and genre satirizing, it takes you over and over again on one crazy trip after another.  Downey is excellent here and his narration is an example of perfect deadpan humor.  I have never been a big fan of Kilmer, but here he is quite funny and a lot less hammy than he has been in the past.  They, along woth Monaghan make a great comic, if bloody, trio.  The film is also gorgeously photographed and beautiful look at.  Great, breezy entertainment!</p></body></html>

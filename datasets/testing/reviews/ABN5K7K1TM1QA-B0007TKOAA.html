Not that I didn't experience many wry grins, tickling chuckles, and some outright belly laughs as I watched it.  I did.  And it is a whole lot funnier than most movies that are supposed to be comedies.  But this is not a comedy, per se.  It is a relationship movie.  It is a buddy movie.  It is a brilliant tour de force by Alexander Payne, who along with Jim Taylor wrote the script, and who directed, based on the novel by Rex Pickett.  On the basis of seeing two of his movies, this and Election (1999) I can say without the slightest doubt, Payne is one very talented man who has Hollywood by the proverbials.<br /><br />Both the script and the direction were superb.  One might say Payne spent a little too much time developing character, but when you see the result, you have to say, it was worth it.  Yes, the movie begins a little slowly, just a little.  Everything seems a little on the ordinary side.  There is not much happening.  We can see that Miles is one of life's losers and that his best bud Jack is one of life's lucky guys.  They are off to the wine country for one last buddy time together before Jack gets married.<br /><br />Jack is a sometime, somewhat talented actor.  God, I knew a few of those guys.  And Miles is a talented but somehow failed writer, a school teacher who has penned a 750-page novel.  Oh, Lord let me buy you a Mercedes Benz.  (Sorry that lyric just slipped in.)  He also reminds me of someone.<br /><br />Miles recently (two years ago actually) got dumped by the true love of his life, his now ex-wife Victoria.  And Jack, bless his heart, is about to marry a very well appointed and very nice looking young woman who lives in a grand house in Palos Verdes (in the script; in the movie it's more like BelAir or thereabouts--which amount to about the same thing).  And so off the two go for wine and golf and the open road.  But be back by Friday night for the rehearsal.  (I'll say no more about that, but keep the word "rehearsal" in mind.  Those who have seen the movie know what I mean.)<br /><br />All right I confess.  This movie hit home with me.  I have been there and done that in a number of ways.  In fact, the familiarity kind of put me off at the beginning.  I mean, I have been to France and I have drunk Chateau Cheval Blanc, and to be honest I have also drunk great burgundies with (God help us) fast food, although unlike Miles I took the food home; I wouldn't de-sanctify the wine by drinking it on the sly at a diner.  By the way, Cheval Blanc is NOT a burgundy and it not made with Pinot Noir grapes.  It is a red wine from Bordeaux made with Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapes.<br /><br />And I and a buddy dated two young women many years ago and almost the same thing happened.  But never mind.<br /><br />In other words, the movie is realistic, so much so that I suspect a lot of viewers will find something in it that relates directly and even spookily to their own lives.  Watch it and see.<br /><br />Can you be too realistic?  Can a movie be so absolutely true to life that it...what?  Loses something?  Is too painful?  Is too prosaic?  Well, I almost thought that in the beginning.  But the movie is so well planned, so well contrived (if you will) so aggressively true to life and honest about human nature that I came within a hair breath of turning it off.<br /><br />Don't you do that!  Don't give up on this movie!  It is craftily planned to reward the viewer with a most interesting and enjoyable movie experience.  This is not to say it is perfect.  Some of the wine dialogue is compromised because what is said must make sense to the general viewer while at the same time remain true (almost) to what afficionados of wine would actually say.  And yes, Payne could have cut to the chase a little quicker.  But sometimes the appetite is whetted when the meal is delayed.<br /><br />In addition to a brilliant script and some very fine direction from Payne, the movie is blessed with some excellent casting.  Paul Giamatti is perfect as Miles, who really is not a loser.  Thomas Haden Church is exactly right as the attractive and confident, every-hustling, womanizing, marginal actor who will get his comeuppance in the next life, not in this one.  Sandra Oh provides a perfect fit as the Asian-American who falls heavily for American men who are not necessarily of Asian descent; and Virginia Madsen keeps just enough of her beauty hidden to be believable as the waitress with a head on her shoulders.<br /><br />I guess I could give Hollywood the ultimate compliment and say that this movie is so slick that it doesn't seem in the slightest bit slick.  That it is so realistic that one never thinks for a moment that it is contrived.  To paraphrase somebody, the essence of the art of story, whether it be a novel, a short story or a movie, is in believable characters in believable situations doing the things we all do, but in a way that goes beyond realism to artistry.  If you can fake that you can make it big not only in Hollywood but anywhere there is an audience, a viewer, a reader, anybody who seeks to be enlightened and entertained and experience the catharsis that art can bring.<br /><br />See this for director Alexander Payne who knows what he is doing at all times.</p></body></html>

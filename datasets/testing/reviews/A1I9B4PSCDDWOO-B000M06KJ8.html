Both of those elements found my favors. However, I really failed to understand the purpose of this movie outside of showing off the fantastical visual feast and beauty of Kristen Dunst. This really isn't a bio-pic on Marie Attoinette. It really doesn't captured the flavor of late 18th century France and the story line goes from one relatively meaningless party scene after another. Jason Schwartman who played hapless Louis XVI, proves equally hapless in a thankless role. Sofia Coppola made very interesting choices but they were choices that will be dated in a few years as today's music in the movie become yesterday's news. That where some of the mistakes of the movie come in was that many of contemporary 21st century concepts were inserted in this movie about a 18th century woman.<br /><br />Perhaps, the saddest thing about this movie was that it ended just when Marie Antoinette's life was about to get very interesting. Kristen Dunst had a chance to show off her acting bit instead be being so one dimensional carefree, free spending character. Coppola had a chance to create a landmark movie but instead, she choose to make momentary statement movie that sounds dated even now.<br /><br />The DVD of this movie proves to be well made. The sound are excellent and images proves to be astoundingly well presented. The extras proves to be average, your usual "Making of the...." and few interviews that follows. Overall, an average package for a movie that really don't have much to say.</p></body></html>

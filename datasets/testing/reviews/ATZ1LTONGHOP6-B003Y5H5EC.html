<meta name="summary" content="A good film, but impossible to identify with"></head><body><p>"Hard Candy" takes the notion of young girls in chat rooms being the prey of pedophiles and turns it on its head by having a young girl stalking pedophiles in chat rooms. At the start of this film, 14 year old Hayley (Ellen Page) meets up with 30 year old Jeff (Patrick Wilson), a man she met in a chat room, but rather than becoming yet another victim of child abuse, Hayley takes matters into her own hands, and pretty soon it's Jeff who's begging for mercy and not Hayley.<br /><br />"Hard Candy" is not the sort of film you watch for fun. In spite of what you might have read in other reviews, this is not another gore-porn (there is actually very little blood in the film), but from a psychological point of view, it is a difficult movie to watch. While watching this film I saw nothing on screen to make me feel nauseous, and yet at several points I found my hand hovering over the remote because thinking about what was happening, from both characters' points of view, was just too much for me. I'm glad that I did continue, however (for the record, if you can get past a certain scene, that you have probably heard about, in the middle of the film, then you shouldn't have trouble making it to the end), because the ideas raised by this film are very interesting and the concept is possibly the most original that I have heard in a long time.<br /><br />This film is not without faults, however. One of the main drawbacks of this film is that the characters are impossible for an ordinary person to identify with, or to even sympathize with. It's essentially a two-role film and one of those roles is a pedophile and the other a psychopath. A second drawback is that Patrick Wilson's character spends most of the film tied up and he just isn't a good enough actor to pull it off, nor is the dialogue written for him while tied up strong enough for him to hold his own against Page's psycho. A third drawback is that the characters are clich&eacute;s. Jeff is your "typical" pedophile and Hayley is your "typical" victim-turned-aggressor. I found myself comparing this film to "Happiness", another film with a pedophile character, and I found the latter to be the better and the far more disturbing film because in "Happiness", writer Todd Solondz did not fall victim to the clich&eacute;s that "Hard Candy"s writer, Brian Nelson, did.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this film, albeit conditionally. If you think that you can handle the themes, then it's worth watching for the questions it raises, but if the concept isn't your cup of tea, then don't feel bad about giving it a miss, because it's not something that I would class as essential viewing.</p></body></html>

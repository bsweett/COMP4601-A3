<meta name="summary" content="The Island is Real"></head><body><p>I was very impressed with this movie, mostly because I can't understand why so many critics bashed it, so I walked into it not really expecting much and about half-way through I thought to myself "the critics were VERY wrong".  I have to say, I've never been too impressed with Ewan McGregor's acting abilities, I mean, he's been decent in a few films, but this movie is the movie he was born to do...His charactor is so alive, so interesting and very well played, unlike is Obi-Wan who is just plain boring.  The plot of the film is this.  There is a facility hosting the last remaining humans after the world has been contaminated and everything has died.  SO these humans are awaiting their trip to 'THE ISLAND' whch is the last uncontaminated natural habitat and they can only win their trip to the Island via a lotery that is run each week.  Lincoln (McGregor), like everyone else is just waiting his turn, until his besst friend Jordan (Johansson) is chosen to leave for the Island.  After doing a little snooping around Lincold see's something that disturbs him enough to where he realizes that this Island is not real.  So thus he grabs Jordan before she meets her doom and they escape.  Upon hearing the truth (they are clones) from a friend McCord (Buscemi) they set on a course to find their sponsers.  They do find Lincolns sponser, Tom Lincoln and they try to attain his help to show the world what is happening in this facility, that they are creating living humans and then killing them for spare parts.  The movie is a great thrill ride, with excellent performances by McGregor and Djimon Hounsou who is really proving himself to be a great actor (see, Gladiator and the 4 Feathers).  I was a little unimpressed with Johanssons charactor but that was just a lack in writing there....she is a very talented actress and gave this her all.  I just have to say that this movie is far more than just an action film.  This movie has heart and has a great moral.  It shows that humans really will do anythin to survive, and it stresses the point that you can't trust anyone, but in the end, you realize that the people you deem least likely will be there for you 100%.  In the wise words on Miss Johansson, "The Island is real, it's us!"</p></body></html>

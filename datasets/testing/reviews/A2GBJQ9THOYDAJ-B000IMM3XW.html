<meta name="summary" content="Pretty bad -- really."></head><body><p>Even for a movie based on a comic book, this one is pretty unwatchable, partly because it tries to take itself way too seriously. I saw "X-Men" shortly after seeing "Fantastic Four," and it suffers greatly by comparison. The only non-cardboard characters are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), and even then Wolverine was too much the nice guy instead of an antihero. This also may be Patrick Stewart's worst movie yet, and Ian McKellen doesn't come out much better. The other actors simply chew the scenery. And -- again, even for a comic book -- the plot holes are enormous. E.g., where did the billions of dollars come from to construct the underground complex at Xavier's private school? (I hate to think what the tuition bills are like. . . .) The original Superman and Batman flicks are proof that a good film of this type is possible.</p></body></html>

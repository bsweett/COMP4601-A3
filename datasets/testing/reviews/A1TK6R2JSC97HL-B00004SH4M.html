<meta name="summary" content="Sort of like a Hitchcock bond"></head><body><p>The story has Bond contending with Auric Goldfinger, a wealthy European industrialist who looks to be cornering the world supply of gold.  Only the US reserve at Fort Knox seems out of his reach, but Goldfinger has plans for that problem.  Bond first meets Goldfinger when he catches the super-villain cheating at cards in Miami.  Then he challenges Goldfinger to a friendly game of golf (friendly because Bond allows the cheating to go on), which leads to a break-in at Goldfinger's refinery in the alps.  Captured by Goldfinger, Bonds manages to convince the bad-guy to keep him alive, if only to determine how much Bond has learned of Goldfinger's mysterious "Operation Grand Slam".  (Goldfinger's ill-fated decision to spare Bond caps a scene in which 007 and Foe share the most memorable dialog of any bond flick "You expect me to talk?"; "Why no Mr. Bond, I expect you to DIE!").  <p>So much of "Goldfinger" was recycled for latter Bond films (especially the horrible "View to a Kill" which essentially recycled the plot - only substituting Christopher Walken for Gert Frobe, Silicon Valley for Fort Knox and a blimp for Goldfinger's private jet) that it's easy to take its thrills for granted.  The biggest thrill of all is how the film is like an attempt to film Bond as if it were directed by Hitchkock - the most obvious signs are the score (an edgy orchestral triumph that more than hints Hitchkock's Bernard Herrman), the surprise twist of Goldfinger's (which requires Bond to think fast and w/o the benefit of his gadgets) and a raft of sexually-charged jokes which seem unusually suggestive for the rest of the series - e.g. the laser slowly creeping up 007's crotch; Bond's response when first learning Pussy Galore's name ("I must be dreaming!"); and the famous masculinity-challenging karate-match between Galore and Bond (nowhere else in the series does Bond learn that the way to a woman's heart is found after a total thrashing).  The villain's rotund shape, suggestive of Hitchkock's famous profile, is probably the strongest sign.  The flick jazzes things up with some fun gadgets (including the famous Aston Martin) but knows to keep Bond in trouble (the car doesn't save him from capture) and a wicked-bad henchmen named Odd-Job who lets a razor-edge Derby do his talking for him.  Whether you buy by Hitch-theory or not, this is still one Bond-flick that can't be missed.</p></body></html>

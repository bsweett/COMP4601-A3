<meta name="summary" content="A fun Action Adventure!"></head><body><p>This adaptation of Clive Cussler's novel is quite interesting and entertaining. Right away you'll notice Clive's interest in antique cars, and of course his trademark knack for the marine life. To the movie itself it demonstrates excellent motion picture photography, meaning the camera crew was doing an excellent job with excitingly unique shots. Most of it plays in Africa - Sahara - duh ... A lot of action with comedic lines by Steve Zahn's character, but a rather unbelievable storyline which might not be the important issue in this flick. As one of the only - if not the only - female characters in this motion picture, Penelope Cruz doesn't really have a role and her role seems forced. Matt is doing alright as the hero Dirk Pitt trying to launch a career as an action star - and maybe it works ... I'm sure he had fun after he apparently went through a rigorous body workout program to put on some muscle -- and it shows.<br /><br />Why do I give this movie 4 stars? First of all I think this movie should get a PG rating instead of the PG-13 as there's no bad language and no sensual situations -- it's actually a very clean movie ... and this is refreshing and a reminder that Hollywood can produce a fun-filled action movie without foul language and without the usual stupid half-naked babe scenes. I think the concept was executed very well and it has been a while since a nice powerboat like a Donzi or SeaRay has been extensively featured and trashed in a movie and in this flick you get the pleasure of such action. It's well worth watching this movie and my wife said that this is one for our DVD collection whenever it's released on DVD in several months or so. I would say it's a cool motion picture adventure for the whole family, but also noting that a film like this is probably not everybody's cup of tea.</p></body></html>

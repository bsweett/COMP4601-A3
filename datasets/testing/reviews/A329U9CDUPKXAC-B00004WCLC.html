<meta name="summary" content="Horrible"></head><body><p>This was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen in my life. The movie was so stupid that I began laughing at the stupidity. Right around the scene where all the characters are singing together is where I came the very close to pushing the &quot;stop&quot; button on my remote control. After that I had given up all hope for this being a good movie. That's disappointing too because the beginning of the movie is so good. The stories they show in the very beginning are interesting. The stories they show during the movie are not only confusing but boring. And not one story has a satisfying ending. The little boy genius story was the most interesting but it went absolutely nowhere. Tom Cruise was the worst. He did a great job acting but his character was so disgusting that I felt embarrassed just to be watching it. Each story can be connected but to do so is stretching it...A LOT! I love how it rains frogs and nobody seems to think anything of it. At that point you can tell that the director has given up on this and he just wanted to get it over with as soon as possible.<p>I would also like to give 1 star to the song at the beginning of the movie, &quot;One Is The Loneliest Number.&quot; I thought that song would never end. I was hoping for a power outage at my house just to shut that girl up!</p></body></html>

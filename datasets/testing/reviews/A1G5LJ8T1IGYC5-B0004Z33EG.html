<meta name="summary" content="STILL THE BEST OF THE RAMBO MOVIES"></head><body><p>MOST PEOPLE REMEMBER ''RAMBO; FIRST BLOOD, PART II'' SO MUCH, THAT THEY ACTUALLY FORGOT THAT THIS MOVIE WAS THE FIRST RAMBO MOVIE. A VIETNAM VETERAN [SYLVESTER STALLONE] IS WRONGFULLY ARRESTED BY A REDNECK COP [BRIAN DENNEHY]. WHEN HE ESCAPES FROM THE POLICE STATION, THE POLICE IMMEDIATELY GO AFTER HIM IN THE NORTHWESTERN JUNGLE. THERE'S A LOT OF SUSPENSE AND THE ACTION NEVER LETS UP. SYLVESTER STALLONE IS IN TOP FORM AS THE TOUGH JOHN RAMBO. ANY ACTION FAN SHOULD HAVE THIS. FOLLOWED BY TWO SEQUELS.</p></body></html>

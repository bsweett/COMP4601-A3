It's way cool, way intense, way intelligent, way well acted and way Spacey--Kevin that it who plays the voice of Hal...I mean, Gerty.<br /><br />Basically, it looks like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey but it's so much more than that. You actually feel like you're on the moon with some terrific scenes of the lunar surface. The light and shadow they work in is simply amazing.<br /><br />Then there's Sam Rockwell's tour de force playing the lone astronaut sent to the moon to man a "mining" operation up there. I won't spoil it for anyone but he plays his roles (yes, that's with an "s") far beyond anything you've seen in any evil twin story.<br /><br />Then there's Kevin Spacey's voice. You'll have flashbacks to 2001's Hal but in a better twist he's a helpful robotic voice.<br /><br />The extras too are exactly what you'd want in a DVD. Besides a couple of commentary tracks, we get the rundown on how they created the visual effects (mainly from models and it shows giving the picture a far grittier realism).<br /><br />There's also two Q&A sessions where you'll be confused as to whether they cloned the director Duncan Jones. In the better Q&A at NASA's Space Center in Houston we get far more the nuts and bolts of the film. In this one DJ looks like a roly poly grad student.<br />In the Sundance Festival Q&A with various members of the production crew there's someone channeling Sam Rockwell's character complete with beard and it's DJ. You'll do a double take but that laugh gives him away. That Q&A seemed so much like the usual--dumb questions from moviegoers. Did nothing for me but contrasted with the NASA Q&A it was fun to watch.<br /><br />That's not all. You also get a 28-min. film called Whistle about a contract killer who hits his marks with the help of laser technology...and it has a nice twist. Having said that, the no-lipped actress who played the killer's wife was sheer awful in her role. Could they not have cast someone better?</p></body></html>

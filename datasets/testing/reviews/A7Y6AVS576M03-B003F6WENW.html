I thought this was just going to be one of your ordinary production line comedies they turn out these days from Hollywood. The situations that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn get into are pretty outrageous. Ultimately the film takes a curious twist toward the bizarre. As the film establishes these two guys, they crash weddings with their incredibly witty and irresistible charm and have women literally falling into to bead with them. The film begins to enter the realm of the surreal once our two protagonists end up with Christopher Walken and his family and entourage who are just very strange people and that is where the film goes wild. You never know what is going to happen next and that's what makes this film so hilarious and also very witty. I found this movie very amusing and downright funny. I haven't laughed like this in years. To give too much of the plot away would ruin this film's impact. I think the general public has overlooked this film to an extent. The trailer for this film was totally misleading. I went in to see this movie reluctantly but came out laughing all the way home. This DVD is outstanding. The numerous scenes of these two womanizers with women in various stages of nudity are incredibly erotic. However, this just sets you up for more unexpected and flat out outrageous scenes. The film gets your natural instincts up to fever pitch and then the floor drops out from under you. The entire cast is perfect and you still never really know what's around the bend in this well scripted romp. Particularly, Vince Vaughn shows an incredible depth of talent I never knew he had. He just about steals this film away in a very subtle way that you just have to see. If you like outrageous humor and want unexpected laughs I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sorry, Roland Emmerich, better luck next time!"></head><body><p>For me, "The Day After Tomorrow", a doomsday epic about the sudden onset of a new Ice Age in the present day, is a disappointment from writer/director Roland Emmerich. His 1994 sci-fi epic, "Stargate" is one of my favorite flicks in that genre. His 1996 effort, "Independence Day" is immensely entertaining.<br /><br />The special effects in "The Day After Tomorrow" rival [and sometimes outdo] Emmerich's previous efforts. The problems are in the story. "Stargate" and "Independence Day" were both about mankind's doing battle with alien beings. Since the vast majority of us have never met an alien being, the logic of stories of such encounters is acceptable. What proof do we have to the contrary? The adversary in "Tomorrow" is Mother Nature, a force we are all familiar with. Suddenly, she has decided to unleash her full fury on us. Unlike alien invasions, though, we are all aware of Nature's wrath, albeit on a smaller scale.<br /><br />As the movie moves a long, the scenario gets less and less plausible. For example, the movie blames our leaders for ignoring global warming [a position that is likely true], thus igniting a sudden Ice Age, yet fails to resolve why this event has occurred countless times in the past, with no human intervention.<br /><br />The other problem with the script is that Emmerich seems to have lost his tongue-in-cheek humor. "Tomorrow" is relentlessly earnest. This is essentially the story of a dour-faced father [Dennis Quaid] determined to rescue his equally sullen son [Jake Gyllenhaal], who is trapped in a super-blizzard of epic proportions in New York City. The triumph of love over adversity is a time-honored one in movies, but here it plays out as hollow and predictable, as well as a bit boring.<br /><br />The movie is another example of modern special effects playing a disproportionate role. Early in the movie, Los Angeles is devastated by a hurricane that spawns a series of devastating tornadoes. Visually, this is by far the movie's best segment. The story never once returns to this catastrophe, instead concentrating only on the New York story. So, why was the LA portion even in the movie? Because highly sophisticated computer special effects deemed that it could be?</p></body></html>

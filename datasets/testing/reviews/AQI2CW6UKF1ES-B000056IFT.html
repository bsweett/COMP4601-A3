His friend tells him don't, but he goes anyway, and when it gowes wrong, the recall people put him in a cab, thus starting the story.<br /><br />Quaid is confused why people are trying to pop caps in him, left and right; even his pal at work turned out to be another killer in his way.  It's all confusing, you can't help but wonder, why are all of these pople trying to kill him?!  Excessive gore(I'm talking pretty gory here[This movie was almost rated X])  without reason.  But if you keep on watching, you'll find a serious reson to why people want him dead(I'm taliking domination/savior reason)<br /><br />The blood in this movie is someting most action movies don't have anymore(The're all weak compered to this).  If you were offended by kill bill, well this is worse because it's realisticly gory.  Not to mention what happened to people when they were exposed to Mars' atmospere(If you have a full-stomach and are weak then for the love of God refrain from watching those sceenes!)<br /><br />The story behind this is a powerhouse.  About 2/3 through the film you find the reason behind the killing.(Plot twists hit you left, right, up, down, verticly, horizontaly, dianaly, eh, you get the picture.  It's rare to see story in bigtime action flicks like this, ex. Kill Bill, Bad Boys 2, Raw Deal, don't have plots for anything.<br /><br />This movie is a gory work of art, with plot and Violence to keep suspence and action fans happy.  If you're a Schwarzenegger fan, this must be in you collection.  If you love the Terminator series(with the exception of 3) Then this is another great Sci-Fi film to get your hands on.  If you hate excessive gore, you might wanna stay clear!  This movie also left me with a cliffhanger thought: Is it reality, is it a dream, or is what the doctor that went in Quaid's room really saying was ture?  A Cliffganger to a sequal never to come.<br /><br />Peace</p></body></html>

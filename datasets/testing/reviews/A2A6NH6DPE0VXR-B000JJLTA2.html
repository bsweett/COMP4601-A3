It has it's flaws yes but I still don't see it as a one star movie. The end makes no sense and it's also dumb that there's a female vampire that seems to be able to be out in the sun. I mean if you're gonna have a vampire in a movie you should go by the rules, they can't be out in sun light. <p>  Still for someone who is a big fan of classic books I found it fun to have all these classic characters together. The movie is brainless but brainless fun, I see no reason to really hate it. Stuart Townsend (Queen of the Damned) is the best thing about the movie as Dorian Grey.  He has the best lines and he has fun in the part as well. The movie has been compared to bad summer movies like Batman & Robin and Wild Wild West but it's a lot better then those. I didn't expect much and I was surprised how much I got into the movie. If you give it a fair chance who knows maybe you'll like it too.</p></body></html>

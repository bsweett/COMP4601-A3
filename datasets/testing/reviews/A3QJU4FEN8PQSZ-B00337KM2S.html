<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but hardly great"></head><body><p>Is it amusing? Yes. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is there a message at the end? Yes. But is it this amazing, fantastic, best movie of the year that everyone is saying it is? Not really.<br /><br />Is it the "feel-good" movie it claims to be on its packaging? No. See all those people smiling in the photos for this product page? Misleading. A big, fat lie. And that's a big clue as to what it knows about itself. It will not appeal to people who are looking for a feel-good comedy. You have to be prepared for "depressing". Nothing wrong with that, but I hate misleading packaging. At least it's nowhere near as dishonest as the packaging for "World's Greatest Dad."<br /><br />Sorry to rain on parades, but I thought fair warning is needed, after seeing all those glowing reviews. It's an OK movie, and you'll probably enjoy it (as much as such things can be enjoyed).</p></body></html>

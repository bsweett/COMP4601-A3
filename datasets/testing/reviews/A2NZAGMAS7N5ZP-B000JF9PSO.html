<meta name="summary" content="Paul Greengrass has managed to deliver a movie we will never forget"></head><body><p>Okay, It's been 5 years since 9/11.And the question comes to our mind whether it is time to do a movie about the attacks or not. In my opinion it is time, people are trying to put the thought of what happened so far back as if it never happened, and I understand the least we want to do is remember that tragic event, but we shouldn't remember it just for the tragedy but also for the day that we all stood up as one. Stood up united. And that's exactly what this movie does. Instead of making it a usual Hollywood movie, director Paul Green grass has managed to deliver something more human, entirely shot in a documentary style. This type of movie should be seen by everyone, and as I said not for the tragedy that occurred to the passengers, but for the historical aspect, and to make us remember that this is a country that stands united, and that we will fight to the last.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 5 OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

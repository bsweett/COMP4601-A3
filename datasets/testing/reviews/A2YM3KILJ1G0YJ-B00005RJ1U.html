<meta name="summary" content="Creepy...still creepy...still creepy...WTF?"></head><body><p>Trisha (Gina Phillips) and Darry (Justin Long) are a college-aged brother and sister driving home on Spring break.  Typical of that age, Darry is bringing his laundry home for his mother.  All is normal until they encounter someone with what appears to be the most severe case of road rage ever.<br /><br />Out of nowhere, a massive, paint smeared, rusted, ominous truck appears.  It even comes with the loud, obnoxious, fog horn.  In a matter of no time, it's on the kid's bumper, tailgating and honking, scaring the hell out of them.  They eventually let it get by, and the license plate is revealed: BEATNGU...foreshadowing.<br /><br />Just as their fear and worry has subsided, they run upon the same scary truck parked at an old, abandoned church.  The driver is outsie of the vehicle, and appears to be tossing bodies wrapped in bloody sheets down a large pipe of some sort.  Unfortunately for them, the person sees them and quickly jumps in the Fearmobile for the chase.  This time, however, the truck starts ramming the kids' car and scaring Darry and Trish until they run off the road.<br /><br />What follows is a tale of fear, as brother and sister go back to investigate the pipe, and uncover a grisly reality that will shock and terrify them.<br /><br />The unfortunate part of this movie is that the bad guy turns out to be a completely cheesy, winged, alien of some kind.  When it is presumed to be a mysterious, evil man, the fear is much more palpable.  But when the large human/bat/chicken thing shows itself, the tone is completely different.  And don't even get me started on the whistling - completely stupid.  After an entire movie of mystery, suspense, and genuine terror, the killer's ridiculousness acts as the cold shower to the movie's built up heat.</p></body></html>

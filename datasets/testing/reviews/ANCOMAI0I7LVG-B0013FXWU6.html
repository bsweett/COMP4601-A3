On the outset, while watching `There Will Be Blood' you could come to believe that to be true of this film.  Heralded as PT Anderson's finest film to date and regarded as one of the two cinematic masterpieces of this year past, `There Will Be Blood' has an obligation to deliver.  What is sad is that many people are not aware of exactly what it plans to deliver.  I can see now how backlash can begin, but I'm here to say that `backlash' in this case is undoubtedly undeserved.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson's epic masterpiece (there, I said it) `There Will Be Blood' is not the movie many may believe it to be.  It is a slow and conflicted journey through the desperations and frustrations placed upon us by greed and selfishness.  It exposes the similarities between materialism and religious self-righteousness and it proves that nothing good can come of evil.<br /><br />`There Will Be Blood' is loosely based of off Upton Sinclair's novel `Oil!' but truly it serves as Anderson's very own vision.  Anderson pits oilman Daniel Plainview against religious preacher Eli Sunday in a small town of Little Boston during the turn of the century.  Plainview is a greedy man, a selfish man who will do anything he can to get what he wants, but Sunday is not much different.  Sunday is a man consumed with a fire that matches the determination of Plainview himself.  They are a perfect match; thus they are perfect enemies.<br /><br />The film moves at a slow pace, taking it's time to build and flesh out these characters.  Aside from Plainview and Sunday you have Daniel's son, H.W., a young yet oddly mature boy who takes in much more than one would expect.  As his fathers `business partner', young H.W. stands comfortably at his father's side; a sight that is often as chilling as it is heartbreaking.<br /><br />`There Will Be Blood' is a film that opens with such a savage calm, a feeling of unsettled tranquility.  The score blazing in the distance, Plainview mining for gold; not a word spoken and yet so much is being said.  It ends on a completely different note; one of tranquil savagery; a burst of manic violence that leaves the viewer feeling oddly subdued.  It's such a masterful way to open and close a film; opening in such a way that keeps us on edge and closing in such a way that puts us at ease.<br /><br />Yet another reason why PT Anderson should have won that directing Oscar.<br /><br />The film is masterfully crafted; a film that just fits so beautifully together, each facet connecting nicely with the next.  It's beautifully shot; the Oscar winning cinematography is spellbinding to say the least.  The score is also a huge plus here, lending a helping hand in creating the perfect mood for this piece.  I remember falling in love with Greenwood's score when I first heard it, but hearing it within the confines of this film adds a whole new light to its grace and beauty.<br /><br />And then there is the acting...<br /><br />Much credit has been given to Daniel Day-Lewis for his performance as Daniel Plainview.  He's won just about every award imaginable and has received countless amounts of praise and admiration, for which he has received it with the utmost sincerity and gratitude.  I am here to acknowledge once again his magnificence here.  Day-Lewis completely becomes Daniel Plainview.  He doesn't look like Daniel Day-Lewis; he doesn't sound like Daniel Day-Lewis; he doesn't act like Daniel Day-Lewis.  Daniel Day-Lewis does not exist within this character; only Daniel Plainview is present.  He flawlessly boils to the surface this mans flaws and transgressions, his bolstering greed and domination.  There are moments when you know that this man is thinking the worst and yet all we see is that sly grin and his eyes, those eyes that speak volumes.  This is not just one of the finest performances of the year, but perhaps in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Daniel is not without good company though.  There are two other performers here that steal scenes and command attention.  Young Dillon Freasier, who plays H.W., delivers a brilliant performance.  He masterfully creates and otherworldly maturity that chills the bones while speaking barely a word.  Pay close attention to the relationship between father and son; there are volumes to be told.  Of course we have Paul Dano who plays the eccentric Eli Sunday.  His performance is mind-bogglingly good.  There is a scene where he proceeds to expel the arthritis from the hands of one of the members of his church.  It's the first scene where we really get a glimpse into this very complex character.  It's brilliant to say the least and it serves as a masterful building block for what is to come.<br /><br />`There Will Be Blood' is a film that everyone should see.  Everyone should know what they are about to witness first; that way they can really embrace it for what it is.  This is not an action film, nor a thriller in your most conventional sense.  `There Will Be Blood' is quite frankly one of the best character studies I've seen in recent years.  It's a film that flawlessly exposes the inhumanity within humanity and forces the audience to accept the `ugly' within our souls.  As many have noted; this is not a film that wants to be liked.  It will not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy on the inside, but it will leave you with much to ponder, much to think about and contemplate and will thus leave you with much to remember.</p></body></html>

It stars Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, and all are excellent in their performances.<br /><br />STORY: Anton Chigurh is a cold blooded killer who would much rather kill people than talk it out with them. Llewyn Moss is a person who finds some dead bodies in a desert and some money, along with a heroin stash. Llewyn takes the satchel and flees with it, not knowing that he's being tracked by Anton. As soon as he finds out he's being tracked, worlds collide!<br /><br />THOUGHTS: Amazing movie!!!! I saw it down in Ontario visiting family, and we loved it. Why is it rated 18A here and 14A there???? It's not that violent!!!!!!!<br /><br />Anyway, great movie, and I hope to see it again!</p></body></html>

The eerieness of the illusionist's performances, and the back story of suspense and romance.  We are kept spellbound until the final illusion.  Edward Norton is mysterious and hypnotizing as the illusionist, Eisenhiem.  The political climate of Vienna and the eccentricities of Crown Prince Leopold rachet up the intrigue.  This is another artist's movie.  If you are an artist you will not be disappointed.  If you are not, you probably won't be either.  Which hand will you seek to look under?</p></body></html>

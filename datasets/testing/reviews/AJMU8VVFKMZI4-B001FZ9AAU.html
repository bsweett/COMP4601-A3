<meta name="summary" content="Bravo.  Bravo.  Bravo."></head><body><p>This film has a little of everything for everyone.  Great writing, great actors and wonderful CGI.  I was never a comic book fan, but in the past decade Marvel has lured me into seeing what the big fascination has been all about.  When one franchise begins to falter (Spider Man) a new one comes onto the scene and takes everyone's breath away.  I only had a few gripes-one Downey's 1940's fast talking/ scarastic delivery some times comes off muffled and who's big idea was it to have such small font on the scenes where translation was needed?  It reminded me of the small print in shady contracts.  Do they really expect people to be able to read it?<br />Other than that-it is great entertainment and I'm looking forward to the next installment to the series.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Cold war Thriller"></head><body><p>This is the original "The Manchurian Candidate", released in 1962 and very much derivative of the tensions of the Cold War.  The Cold War context provides its suspenseful and haunting story with a logic denied the recent and convoluted remake starring Denzel Washington and Liev Schieber.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra leads an outstanding cast as Major Marco Bennett, an Army officer recently returned from combat in Korea, who is troubled by strange dreams associated with a patrol for which Sergeant Raymond Shaw (played by Laurence Harvey) was awarded the Medal of Honor.  Bennett, in search of his own peace of mind, makes contact with other survivors of the patrol and ultimately with Raymond Shaw himself.  An encounter with Shaw's Korean houseboy triggers a memory of the patrol different from the account parroted by all the survivors.  Bennett's relentless investigation of this anomaly slowly unravels a murderous plot involving Raymond's manipulative mother (played in an Oscar-nominated turn by Angela Lansbury), and insipid politician stepfather (played by veteran character actor James Gregory), and a group of shadowy Chinese military officers.  Bennett will end up racing against time to defeat the plot, which has as its goal nothing less than a monstrous crime against the American Government.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra has lots of help in this film.  Janet Leigh plays a very understanding love interest.  Laurence Harvey is superb as the lonely and tortured Raymond, manipulated by his enemies in ways he cannot fight and forced into horrific acts.  Angela Lansbury gives a compelling performance completely at varience with her "Murder, She Wrote" personna.  A kiss between Raymond and his mother may be one of the most chilling moments ever captured in an American movie.<br /><br />The DVD provides a crisp black and white rendition of the movie, along with several interesting special features on the making of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to those seeking a superb Cold War thriller featuring a collection of first-rate actors in an excellent story.</p></body></html>

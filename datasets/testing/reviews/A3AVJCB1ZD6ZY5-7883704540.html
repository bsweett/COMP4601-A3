I was there at the opening of "Toy Story" and I fell in love with their charming animation. Woody and Buzz, even the little game-machine alien, were just as evocative as any big-name actor--and a lot more fun.<br /><br />What I especially like about Pixar is they really do push the envelope. Think about it, they've made us come to care for bugs--and now a rat.  That's no mean feat.  I suspect Pixar's amazing talent could make a dungbeetle's antics hilarious and oddly appealing.<br /><br />The story in brief, Remy (Patton Oswalt's voice) is a rat with taste. He's watched a lot of cooking shows featuring his favorite, Chef Gusteau and he's even learned to read Gusteau's book, "Anyone Can Cook." He's hiding this information from his father, who has a different opinion.<br /><br />Remy gets tragically separated from his family colony and begins to see the ghost of Chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett's voice) and the Chef gives him some very good advice:<br /><br />"If you're focused on what you've left behind, you will not be able to see what lies ahead. Now go up and look around!"<br /><br />Remy discovers he's in Paris, home of the best food in the world--at least, according to Parisians. And he's very close to Gusteau's restaurant.<br /><br />Surreptitiously, he enters the restaurant to find there's a new garbage boy, Linguini (Lou Romano's voice) spoiling the soup.  Remy cannot help but 'fix' the problem.  The soup's a hit and Linguini's got a promotion, the problem is Linguini really can't cook.<br /><br />So, Linguini and Remy team up.  Their communication and antics are hilarious.  Only the way, we encounter a hardbitten critic's critic, Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole's voice) who ruined Gusteau's restaurant in the first place and indirectly caused his demise, Skinner (Ian Holm's voice) who now presides over the kitchen of Gusteau's and hopes to inherit the empire.<br /><br />The story's fun, and for the most part, predictable.  There is some wonderful French humor along the way too. "Ratatouille" was an interesting evening's viewing, but despite my Pixar Addiction, I doubt I will own this one.</p></body></html>

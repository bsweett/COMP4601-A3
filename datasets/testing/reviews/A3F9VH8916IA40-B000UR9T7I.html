<meta name="summary" content="The biggest disappointment since Pirates of the Caribbean 2."></head><body><p>I waited a long time for this movie to come out. I watched the trailers with anticipation and slowly awaited its release into theaters. I heard great stuff about this film. "The best spider man" or "best movie of the year". So yeah, I had some pretty high hopes for this movie. Would Harry try to get back at Parker? Would Parker marry Mary Jane? Would Jamison finally get off spider man's back?<br /><br />Then I saw the movie. Well actually, I almost didn't, because I almost fell asleep half way through. The whole movie was boring from the opening to the cry baby ending. Nothing here was fun; even the bad guys were stupid. How can you have venom in your movie and have it suck? That takes skill, or lack of skill.<br /><br />this movie suffers from Pirates of the Caribbean 2 syndrome, which is basically "bigger is better, so lets jam as much stuff into a movie as we possibly can." yeah, pirates was a complete flop because they tried to jam too much into the movie, and this one is the same. There are too many sub plots and no main plot. i mean come on, first we have sandman trying to get money to save his daughter (subplot 1) then spider man basking in his new fame and glory (subplot 2) then Harry trying to kill spidy and then being put in a coma and losing his memory, so now he doesn't even remember his fathers death (subplot 3). then Mary Jain losses her job and starts hating parker for being insensitive (subplot 4) and then spidy gets attacked by dark matter turning him into a bad guy (subplot 5) then parkers job is threatened by a new photographer (subplot 6) then Harry wakes up from his comma and starts going after peters heart, sound familiar? (Subplot 7). Not to mention the revelation that sandman was uncle bens real killer (subplot 8). Good god, that a lot of stuff. there's enough here to make two or three movies, but instead of doing that they decide to jam it all into one three hour movie (that's way too long by the way. the LOTR could pull that off, but not SM). What is missing though in this movie is a central plot. Unlike the first two movies there is no central plot that the rest revolve around. In the first it was Parker tying to learn how to use his powers properly and fight off Green Goblin, in the second it was Parker trying to juggle being a college student, spider man, his love life, his job, and his friends all at the same time and failing badly. Here it's just a jumble of subplots thrown in together with no logical thinking behind it. What is the main plot? Please, fans of the movie tell me. Was it spidy turning bad? Was it Sandman killing his uncle? What was it? Everything in this movie is just sort of randomly thrown together. After the first hour I got bored and almost fell asleep but couldn't because the lady sitting to me was eating her popcorn too loudly. too bad, I could have caught up on my sleep, but no, I had to watch this movie till the bitter end.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the ending. First of all didn't the scene where Mary Jane is stuck in the wed and the cad is slowly making its way down to her look kind of similar to a scene in Jurassic Park? Yeah, I think it did. Second, when did spidy become so much of a wimp? I mean really, I know he was outnumbered, but he is a veteran super hero, while sandy and venom were newbie's. Couldn't he have at least put up a halfway decent fight?  I don't want to ruin the ending for you but pretty much think of the most clich&eacute;, corny, idiotic thing that could possibly happen and that is the ending. I'll give you a clue, it involves Harry.<br />And after the battle when everyone was crying and boohooing I was just rolling my eyes. Everyone cries at the end, even sandman. How can he cry? He's made of sand. Now don't get me wrong, I like sad movies (read some of my lists and you can see that for yourself) but the "sad" ending in this movie was so over the top, so corny, so clich&eacute;, that I almost threw my popcorn at the screen in frustration.<br /><br />Another thing that annoyed the heck out of me was that the characters would constantly say and do the absolute worst things they could possible can at the absolute worst times. Mary Jane is going through a rough time, so Parker kisses another girl in public and then doesn't understand why she's upset. Please...<br /><br />Overall this movie sucked. Nothing good here, not even the fight scenes. You should still go see it just because, but don't expect anything like the first two movies. This one was bad, plain and simple. if you read thsi review, whether you agree with me or not, please leave a comment.</p></body></html>

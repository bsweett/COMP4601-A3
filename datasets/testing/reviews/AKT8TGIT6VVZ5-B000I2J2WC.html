<meta name="summary" content="Splendid Thriller Courtesy of Director Ron Howard, Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and a Fine Cast"></head><body><p>Not having read Dan Brown's novel "The Da Vinci Code", I had few expectations for this film, ignoring much of the controversy surrounding both the novel and the film. I'm surprised that "The Da Vinci Code" has garnered many poor reviews, since it may be the best film - and without a doubt, the best thriller - made by director Ron Howard. Distinguished screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has also written a superb script which apparently adheres closely to the original novel's tale, but with a more exciting, and better, ending. I was most impressed with the film's pacing, with splendid acting from the cast, including Tom Hanks as Harvard professor Robert Langdon. Noted young French actress Audrey Tautou gives a splendid performance as French cryptologist Sophie Neveu. Other memorable performances include those by veteran French actor Jean Reno as Paris Police Captain Fache, popular young English actor Paul Bettany as Silas, the murderous albino monk, and acclaimed German actor Jurgen Prochnow as the slippery Swiss banker Andr&eacute; Vernet. I was also delighted to see Alfred Molina play yet another fascinating villain as Bishop Aringarosa. But some of the most thrilling scenes are those that include acclaimed British actor Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, who plays a most important role in the unfolding quest led by Langdon and Neveu in search of The Holy Grail. I found "The Da Vinci Code" as exciting as some of the best in the "James Bond" series featuring actor Sean Connery as James Bond; the film itself had nonstop excitement and intrigue, with rarely a dull moment, inspite of its long running time.<br /><br />Many critics of the film have suggested that it tends to be too talkative, allegedly slowing down the film's pace. I strongly disagree, since I found "The Da Vinci Code" a fascinating, intelligent, and rather exciting thriller, which kept me at the edge of my seat when I saw the film earlier today. Other critics have been those who have objected to the film's portrayal of the fundamentalist Roman Catholic sect Opus Dei, but this thoughtful criticism should be aimed instead at author Dan Brown, the novel's writer (It's a criticism that I am somewhat in agreement with, since I found almost incredible, the character of Silas, the murderous monk, even if he was portrayed brilliantly by actor Paul Bettany.). Despite these criticisms, I still think that diehard fans of Dan Brown's novel - and those like myself who haven't read it - will enjoy "The Da Vinci Code" as a gripping cinematic thriller. Without a doubt, Ron Howard's newest film should be regarded as one of the best films to see in theaters during the summer of 2006.</p></body></html>

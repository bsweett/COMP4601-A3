This film's amazing.  I have no interest in influencing my views of it.  On the topic of "editions", the rated version is the one to buy.  I have the unrated one and the extra footage adds nothing.  The sex scene actually flows into the surrounding film better in the cut version.  The print they telecined to DVD also doesn't look as early a generation as the rated one, which is a little more crisp, clean, and vibrant than this one.  I remember the rated rental having very pure whites in the opening scene, and the lunch scene with Willem Defoe was more vibrant and rich looking.  There seems to be generation loss with the unrated version, or I could just be remembering it wrong. I have not seen the new Killer's collector edition, though.</p></body></html>

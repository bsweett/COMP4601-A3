It reminded me of MAGNOLIA in the way it intertwined the stories together, and how they all came together. It was a very moving, powerful film with EXCELLENT performances. Nicole Kidman was AWESOME as Virginia Woolf and Julianne Moore was mesmerizing. Ed Harris was PERFECT in his role. It is a film that really makes you think, and as you're watching it, you realize that at one point in your life, you have felt like these characters before. I will end up buying this one, and now I want to read the book as well.<br /><br />2010 review:<br /><br />It is clear to me upon reading many of the comments on this site, that most of the viewers did not "get" this film. To fully grasp the themes of the film, it helps to have read both Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway" and Cunningham's "The Hours" in order to understand the psychology of the characters and the reasoning behind their life choices. This film is more or less about three women from three different decades, who are sublimely unhappy with their lives, and who try to cope with that unhappiness through art and creativity. All the while, they seriously consider suicide as an end to their misery, but opt to stay alive to make others around them happy. Some survive this inner struggle, and some don't. Some will argue with the film's humanist worldview, but as far as I can tell, these emotions are real, these situations are real, and they happen every day. The Hours only brings those things to the light.<br /><br />Much has been made of the "lesbian" kissing scenes in the film. The viewers who have commented vehemently on these three instances have indeed taken it all out of context. These women so desperately want to make a connection with another human being, that the kisses aren't what they seem to be on the surface. They are not sexual, by any means. Yes, there are gay and lesbian characters in the film, but there are gay and lesbian people in life, as well.<br /><br />Every time I see this film, it's as though I see it through new eyes. I always gain a fresh perspective, and this has much to do with the fact that I am older, and have gained much more life experience than when I first saw the film years ago. Everything about the film bursts with life, from the beautiful cinematography, to the acting, the Philip Glass' beautiful score. There is also an unexpected scene of forgiveness that is truly touching.<br /><br />You should come away from this film a little more enlightened than you were before, that is, if you are willing to go there...and it always helps to read the books beforehand to gain a fuller experience. Those who have claimed that the film is about "nothing" are dead wrong. This film works on so many levels. It is nothing short of a miracle.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

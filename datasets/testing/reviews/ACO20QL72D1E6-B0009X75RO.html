<meta name="summary" content="Has the Musical genre finally come back?"></head><body><p>Permit me 2 be a bit historic. Thanks 2 big-budget-muliti-length musical overkill 1968-73 with non-singing actors in leading roles  - the musical genre KILLED itself by the mid 70s...<p>This is 2003 and recently we have experienced Evita, Little Voice, Moulin Rouge and NOW - Chicago.<p>The film has borrowed a lot in style from Bob Fosse`s CABARET 1972. There are killer moments such as Cell-Block Tango and Roxy`s Press Conferance. <p>BUT; to put Catherine and Renee in high profiled musical roles has its short comings. Cathy may have played the West End a decade ago, but her high kicks simply isn`t enough. She can be played down by any number of talented musical stars in Europe and the US. Renee? She is NOT a sexpot! Period! She tries valiantly and has her moments; but it really should have been a Marilyn Monroe-type.<p>Critics hail this as the biggest thing! Have they gone mad? Have dare they compare this with the MGM greats 1939-1958, Busby Berkeley, Judy Garland, The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, Bob Fosse, Barbra Streisand and the Minnellis? These products, artists and creators are of legendary fame and DESERVEDLY so...<p>Cbicago IS IMPORTANT, and of good work. But a masterpiece? The only reason THE PIANIST(about horrors during World War II) lost at the Academy Awards was the times... The Iraque-"crisis". Naturally a musical was rewarded and not the horrors of a war...This is how it has always been! People don`t want 2 sorrows of war when their in the midst of it. By do u think musicals flourished in the 30s(th Depression), the 40s(The World War 2) and 60s?(Vietnam)????<p>Chicago is a satiricial product and has important statements; but PLEASE let us have REAL musical stars in these films. PLEASE!</p></body></html>

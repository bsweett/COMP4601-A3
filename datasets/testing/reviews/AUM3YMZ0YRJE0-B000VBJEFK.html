The rat stumbles onto a situation, where a bumbling man boy (also someone who doesn't fit in) is trying to get work in a restaurant, and helps him to appear as if he were a chef of genius.  Once the boy understands the rat's talent, it makes for some pretty funny role playing to keep the secret.  The man boy meets a girl, begins to make his fortune, etc.  Then, there is an imbroglio, including a dustup with a vindictive resto critic, throwing everything into jeopardy.  This is pretty formulaic stuff and the happy ending is predictable.<br /><br />That being said, the film does do a great job regarding the themes of conformity, surprising talents, and the need to throw away one's prejudices.  It is very well done, and amidst the antics my son was moved by it, too.  Recommended, though given Disney's pricing policies, we probably won't buy it.</p></body></html>

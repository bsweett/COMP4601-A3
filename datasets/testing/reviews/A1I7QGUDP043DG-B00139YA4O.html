There is some 'silliness' in the beginning, where Jack seems to be the only one running around helping people, etc., but the writer put in enough hooks to keep one watching. We're also pulled into each individual life with flashbacks, but not so many that it bogs the story down. It's fast enough that you might miss details, so watch them more than once. I also enjoy not having to wait through commercials!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay<br /><br />author of 'Souls of the North Wind'</p></body></html>

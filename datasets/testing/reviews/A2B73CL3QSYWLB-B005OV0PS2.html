<meta name="summary" content=""The Dude's Not In....""></head><body><p>Fresh from the Oscar success of "Fargo" it would have appeared that the Coen brothers had finally found the knack of cracking the "mainstream".  Then comes this tale of kidnapping, nihilism, pornography and...bowling.  In the masterful hands of the Coens these disparate elements all tie together not unlike the Dude's rug that the Asian thug soiled.  In a career of excellent yet unheralded performances Jeff Bridges' account of the Dude ranks at the top.  John Goodman as Dude's unhinged buddy Walter is probably the best work he's ever done.  Great supporting cast.  And what can you say about a film where Steve Buscemi is the sanest character?  I waited for years to replace my VHS copy of this film with a proper release.  I can't verify whether this "Collectors Edition" is misleading.  I did like the intro by "film preservationist" Mortimer Young, though.  The old VHS copy that I owned had Spanish subtitles running across the bottom.  Initially I thought this was another surreal joke by the Coens but a Latino buddy of mine assured me that it wasn't.</p></body></html>

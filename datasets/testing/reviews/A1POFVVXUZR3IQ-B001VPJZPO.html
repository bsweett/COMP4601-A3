<meta name="summary" content="Plot twists & a good supporting cast keep this movie fresh"></head><body><p>A couple of things make this movie a worthwhile addition to the horror/thriller genre: one - the beautiful cinematography that brings to life the creepy lushness of the Louisiana Bayou, two - some very good supporting roles, by Gena Rowlands [the creepy old hag, Violet Devereaux], and John Hurt [as the invalid Ben, Violet's husband], & finally three - the central theme of hoodoo wch is a kind of folk magic. That being said, the story itself centers around the character of Caroline [Kate Hudson] who is engaged as a young caregiver to Ben. She is a stay-at-home nurse, and so has to not only put up with Violet's eccentric character, but also with the spooky atmosphere of the old house she now inhabits with all its sinister undertones. The plot itself is quite interesting...Caroline suspects that Violet is deliberately harming her husband, Ben, and also that hoodoo is involved, so she delves deeper into the subject. She also tries to enlist the help of Violet's family lawyer, Luke [Peter Sarsgaard in a ho-hum role] to help solve the mystery. Let's just say that Caroline finds her cynicism in hoodoo challenged by some of her experiences, and the rest of the movie deals with the aftermath of her involvement with the Deveraux couple. Kate Hudson does not seem to be able to get into her character here, just the usual expressions of fear/puzzlement/bravado, and in my opinion, gives a lacklustre performance. Only Gena Rowlands as the menacing Violet and John Hurt as the helpless Ben lend credence to their roles. The scary effects are few and far between but there is a sense of menace and evil thanks to the way the scenes are set up. The plot twists too will keep viewers interested to know what's coming next. Final verdict: an average thriller dealing with the supernatural ,but definitely worth a look.</p></body></html>

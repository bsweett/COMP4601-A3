The special effects are great (as with every Tim Burton film), and the cast is perfect.  Johnny Depp may be the best young actor we have, and  he plays the part of Icabod Crane to hilarious perfection.  Even Christina  Ricci gives a solid performance as his love interest.  The action sequences  featuring the headless horseman come fast and furious, and make this movie  well worth your money.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="They took the Adventure out of the Poseidon Adventure"></head><body><p>What happened to the Christmas three ?<br /><br />The main dilemma on the original movie's premise was that Gene Hackman wasn't even sure taking the survivors to the top of the ship was the right move, he couldn't even convince most of them to follow him while the remaining ones questioned every move he made. On this new version the ship turns over and the survivors just take off, no big dilemma, no bad guy to question anybody, just mindless action. Once they get off the ship a conveniently located raft and two arriving helicopters kill off any of the few, remaining sense of suspense.<br /><br />It's been 2 months since I saw this movie in a theater and I have a hard time remmembering who it was that survived and who didn't, in other words, I didn't give a damn and judging by the film's box office results, not many did.<br /><br />I find it incredible that in 2006's Hollywood, $150,000,000 can't buy you a decent remake to a film that in it's day was criticized for its cartoony characters.Compared to the 2006 version all of them (including the insufferable "where are you sis!" kid) deserved an Oscar.</p></body></html>

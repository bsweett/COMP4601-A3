Special effects are good, and the storyline is actually interesting and considerably more engaging than the one found in Terminator 3.<br /><br />But it feels like they're just in it for the money. John Connor meets his (teenaged) father in this film (before Daddy time traveled to the past to help Sarah Connor) and while this was a interesting twist, I felt it was a rather unneccessary story to be told. The part with the cyborg/former prisoner was more interesting, though, and it gives Skynet some more dimensionality than in previous films.<br /><br />All in all, a decent thriller like the third, just don't hold HIGH expectations and you'll probably enjoy it.</p></body></html>

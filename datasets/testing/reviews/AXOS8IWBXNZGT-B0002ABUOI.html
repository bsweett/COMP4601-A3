<meta name="summary" content="Apocalypse, morning"></head><body><p>Watched Dawn of the Dead (in its unrated version) last night...<br /><br />In brief, the movie is about the fall of civilization, and how the survivors cope with it, with the cause of the apocalypse is still clamoring at the door, demanding their lives as well. Of course, the cause of the apocalypse this time is the rise of rather feral zombies, and those who die as the result of being bit by a zombie are doomed to have their bodies become zombies as well. This last piece of knowledge is not spread fast enough to prevent the fall of civilization<br /><br />The movie opens as a zombie child bursts into the heroine's home, kills her husband, and then the dead husband turns on her. Fleeing her home in her car, she notices, for the first time, that suburbia has descended into chaos, with zombies roaming the streets, seeking unsuspecting human prey. Eventually, the heroine, and a scattered band of other folks she encounters, retreat to the neighbourhood mall, where they hole up, at least for a time. There, the despair of their situation sets in, as contact with the outside world falls away, and they realize that rescue is not coming, and more and more zombies circle the mall.<br /><br />There is gory violence, a hallmark of movies of this genre. The humour is rather macabre (ref. shooting the Jay Leno and Burt Reynolds zombies out in the parking lot, for fun). There is a hint of desperate sex. Interpersonal conflicts come up all the time: lots of differing opinions as to what to do about their desperate straits, not helped by the fact that they've all had to arm themselves with guns for protections. At the same time, a few of the characters reach out to each other for emotional support, in a rather believable way.<br /><br />The zombies are a means to an end. This is an apocalypse story, and I have seen similar storylines with triffids, with nuclear war, with biological nasties gone awry. The point of stories like this, when told well, is to illustrate how small groups of people can deal with stressful and severe situations. This movie fits into the "thoughtful" end of the horror genre.<br /><br />The movie is replete with gory violence, and is not for kids. For those who are interested in thoughtful horror movies, then this might be your cup of tea.</p></body></html>

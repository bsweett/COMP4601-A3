Bryan Singer, best known for his direction of the box office hits, X-Men 1 & 2, gives the viewers a movie that honors the beloved American icon and wisely ignores the two sequels that pretty much killed off the Superman franchise.<br /><br />The plot begins 5 years after the ending of the second Superman  movie.  Superman, having gone off to find his home world, Krypton and finding nothing, returns to Earth to find Lois moving on with her life, now a mother and a Putlizer prize winner, not to mention the fiancee of Richard White, nephew of Daily Globe editor, Perry White.  While gone, Lex Luthor, Superman's nemesis has been released from prison, bamboozled a rich old lady out of her money and set into action a wicked plan that will doom billions of people.  The storyline places Superman face to face with Luthor as well as placing him as the guardian of Metropolis and the world.<br /><br />Brandon Routh is a perfect selection for Clark Kent/Superman.  With his clean cut good looks and charming smile, he easily fills the red boots vacated by Christopher Reeve, to whom along with his wife, Dana, the movie is dedicated.  There are times when Routh looks uncannily like his predecessor.  He is perfect for the role and I look forward to seeing him in the inevitable sequels.  Kate Bosworth is also good as Lois Lane.  I wasn't impressed with the casting of Ms. Bosworth as Lois when I first heard, but I think she gave a nice performance.  My biggest disappointment, is with the casting that I most looked forward to-----Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.  I guess I just expected more.  He didn't seem to fully throw himself into the role and Parker Posey as his moll, Kitty, stole all of her scenes with him.  And one other trivial comment---someone give Lois' son, Jason, a haircut, please!  He looks like they pulled him out of a cave, where he was raised by wolves!!<br /><br />The special effects are impressive.  The whole sequence with the airplane is worth the ticket price alone but there are other great action sequences in the film.  The flying effects are so much more advanced from the other films and it really looks so much more convincing.  One of my favorite scenes, which I think is quite romantic, is when Superman first confronts Lois about his disappearance, taking her for a ride above the clouds where he offers a simple but heart-felt apology.  Bryan Singer apparently loves these type of films and puts a lot of heart and effort into them.  I hope that he will direct the sequel before he flies off to another project!<br /><br />This movie has a lot to live up to and must certainly justify its pricey film budget.  While it wasn't as perfect as Spiderman 2, this is a great superhero film and a must see on the silver screen.  I gave the film 5 stars because of Brandon Routh, the special effects and the direction of Bryan Singer.  If I could have, I would have taken a half a star for Spacey's lack luster performance.  Otherwise, this is a near perfect superhero movie.<br /><br />If you are looking for action-packed summer entertainment, this is it.  Grab your popcorn, sit back, and become a kid again...wishing you could fly too!</p></body></html>

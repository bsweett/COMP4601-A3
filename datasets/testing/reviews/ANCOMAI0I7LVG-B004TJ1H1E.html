<meta name="summary" content="This movie is HOT, HOT, HOT..."></head><body><p>I'm a recent member of the Billy Wilder fan club, but I'm quickly rising in the ranks for in all honestly I have yet to see a film he has done that has not met with my wildest of expectations.  At the moment I've only seen four, but all four (`Sunset Boulevard', `The Apartment', `Double Indemnity' and now `Some Like it Hot'; in that order) are five star films and would most likely make my top 100 films of all time.<br /><br />`Some Like it Hot' has been a film I have been itching to watch for a long time now.  I remember seeing the stage production quite a few years back (at a dinky dinner theater at that) and I remember loving it, even if the production values were a little weak.  The story was cute and well executed and I just knew that the film must be stellar, especially with Lack Lemmon in the lead (just love that guy).  Still, I had never pushed myself hard enough to actually see the movie.  That is until the other night when it was playing on TCM and I just knew I had to take the opportunity to actually watch this classic.  I was so pleased with the end result, a comedy that works on every level brilliantly, that I had to watch it again immediately after the credits began to roll (the beauty of a DVR).<br /><br />`Some Like it Hot' tells the story of two band members, Joe and Jerry, who wind up on the run after witnessing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.  With no where to go they decide to don drag costumes and join an all female band on the road to Florida.  Once there both Joe and Jerry (or should I say Josephine and Daphne) meet many obstacles in their hideout, not the least of them is lead singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, the boozy blonde who has sworn off love until the right type of millionaire comes along.  While Joe tries to become that millionaire, Jerry finds himself dodging the advances of Osgood Fielding III, a skirt chasing divorcee (multiple times now) who is enamored with Daphne's feminine charm.  Couple this with the advancing threat of gangster and you have one perfectly complete comedy that hits its mark every single time.<br /><br />The script is flawlessly crafted, delivery smart and sassy dialog as well as off the wall gags and brilliant character development, allowing us to get to know everyone in the cast and grow to appreciate their predicaments.<br /><br />The script is embellished by the stunning cast.  In all actuality it stuns me that only Lemmon was singled out as Oscar worthy (he was the only actor in the bunch to receive an Oscar nomination; losing to Charlton Heston) when in fact the entire cast is flawless.  Yes, Lemmon is the comedic highlight, and his antics are surely best-in-show, but Tony Curtis should have also received a nomination alongside his screen partner for delivering a truly tender and believable performance as the lovelorn Joe.  Marilyn Monroe, who won the Golden Globe for her performance, should have also received a nomination, for her performance is iconic.  She is the superlative example of what an enticing ditzy blonde should be, and she sets the standard that so many other actresses have failed to live up to.  Joe E. Brown steals every scene he's in as Osgood, and his lack of an Oscar nomination is truly saddening.<br /><br />But this movie is all about Billy Wilder, a director who understands his actors and understands his material and works to deliver a complete film, one that covers all the bases so-to-speak and lives up to his name.  So far I've seen four masterpieces by this man, and I have a feeling that the rest are just as impressive.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Hannibal&quot; by Ridley Scott"></head><body><p>This is a wonderfully twisted film. It is the second sequel to Michael Mann's excellent film &quot;Manhunter&quot; (1986), Jonathan Demme's &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991) being #2, and Ridley Scott's &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001) being #3. Also see Brett Ratner's &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (2002), the remake of &quot;Manhunter&quot;.<br /><br /> You can read about the plot and everything under the amazon.com review so I won't bother. in the end this is a GREAT film with excellent acting, directing and script. As all the &quot;Manhunter&quot; films are concerned this is the most underrated and mabye the best in my book. All four of these films are classics and I recomend them to any hard core movie fan. They are murder mystery cinema at its best!<br /><br /> &quot;Hannibal&quot; by Ridley Scott (2001)<br /><br /> Anthony Hopkins, Julieanne Moore<br /><br /> *****/*****<br /><br /> One final note Moore and Foster give equally memorable performences as Agent Starling.</p></body></html>

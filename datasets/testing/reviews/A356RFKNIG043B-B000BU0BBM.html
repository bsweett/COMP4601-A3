<meta name="summary" content="Fabulous last half-hour...but tough to get that far"></head><body><p>There's a real payoff in every way during the denouement of this Gilliam phantasmagoria, but sitting through the previous 90 minutes is not always easy.<br /><br />The main issue is the script and/or the editing, which produces a confusing opening act that is rarely clear and oft confusing. At points I was uncertain precisely what had happened, to whom, and why. Yet it was all so gorgeously rendered, and Damon so often wryly humorous, that I stuck it out.<br /><br />Glad I did, for the last half hour is truly masterful, and almost seems to be lifted from another movie---a movie where everything moves forward logically, the effects support the plot, and the characters' actions make sense. It made me sad, because if the rest of the film was this good it would have been a true a classic. Alas.<br /><br />My respect for Gilliam remains undiminished; his main fault here seems to me to have been not doctoring the early part of the script to make more sense and move more quickly. There are various liitle inside jokes/lines about not having enough money, which further research reveals must have been Gilliam's pokes at the studio for giving him "only" 75 million dollars to make this. Since when is 75 mil a pittance? One of the extra features has Gilliam mentioning that he wanted to avoid CGI and use real-action, but when he saw the rushes of the walking trees, for example, they looked horrible. And thus he used CGI. Sounds like Terry is at fault for not budgeting himself properly and blowing too much on pipe dreams.<br /><br />So perhaps that's where all the money went. In any case, the costumes and sets are mostly stellar, and the film looks like a million bucks, or at least 75. Yet the flaws remain. No order of filmic extravagances can save a muddled script. Ledger did little for me; Damon outperforms him easily by bringing some wryness to his portrayal, something Ledger was incapable of here. There are many moments reminiscent of other fantasy flicks; Legend and Van Helsing seemed to have been touchstones. But this film suffers as Legend did from implacability, and doesn't have enough of VH's tongue in cheek self-mocking to make it all fun.<br /><br />There are also some jarring scenes that detract, like the lengthy very real skinning of a rabbit, sickening to see in context of all this beauty. The kitchen sink et cetera are here, and take away from the focus of the movie, which to me should have been more on the original Grimm's fables and their many lovely and fearful contrasts and less on this script's pointlessly byzantine workings.<br /><br />I'd rarely recommend it, but simply watching the last half hour of BG might be the way to go. You won't miss much plotwise, and you'll see a truly great mini-movie. It'll make you want to see the rest, and when you watch that you'll lament at how close this is to a truly classic fantasy flick...and how far.<br /><br />But then again, Gilliam gave us not only the excellent movies Brazil and Time Bandits, and the perfect Holy Grail, but also the slapdash flops of Jabberwocky and Baron Munchhausen; this isn't his first confusing mess. Perhaps his Python buddies would have added the humor and focus this film shoots for but never quite attains.<br /><br />[And by the way: Happy New Decade to all! Let's hope this one turns out better than the aptly-named Zeroes. No villain in Grimm could ever touch Daddy's Little Idiot.]</p></body></html>

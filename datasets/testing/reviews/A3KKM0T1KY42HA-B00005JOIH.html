<meta name="summary" content="Tragic Story. Tragically Long Movie."></head><body><p>Munich is the story of the aftermath of the tragic 1972 murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics. The story is well told, but full of detail that quite simply makes the movie way too long (2 hours 45 minutes).<br /><br />Munich follows how five men led by Eric Bana are put together to eliminate the Black September terrorists responsible for the massacre. The dialogue is good; the action is good when it's there; there is suspense and overall the movie is morbidly entertaining....Nothing like seeing terrorists get their just desserts.<br /><br />But Steven Spielberg has gone a bit overboard with unnecessary detail creating wide gaps in the action that makes an epic out of a story that could easily have been told in a much shorter amount of time.<br /><br />So if you've got almost 3 hours to kill, and you're looking for a realistic, detailed depiction of the events that occurred after the 1972 Munich massacre...this movie is a bullseye. If slow moving movies put you to sleep...nighty night.</p></body></html>

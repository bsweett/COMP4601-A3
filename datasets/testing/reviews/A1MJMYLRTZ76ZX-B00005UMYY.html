<meta name="summary" content="Interesting & well-done film"></head><body><p>This sort of movie is not really my thing, but I enjoyed it just the same, and I can recognize it certainly is a fine movie. I prefer more visually appealing screen blockbuster action-type flicks with lots of special effects myself, but there are a lot of classic movies I enjoy, and this one will probably become a classic in its own right.<p>The overall premise is quite interesting, since the scenes occur in reverse order, as you watch the memory-impaired Guy Pearce try to solve the mystery of his wife's murder. Pearce does an excellent job in the role, as he methodically gathers the evidence and tries to sort it all out despite his memory impairment.<p>Before his memory defect occurred, he was an insurance fraud investigator, and if it's one thing he learned from his old job, it's the importance of having a system for gathering the facts and considering the evidence. Pearce does just that, and by taking photos and writing notes on them, he is able to remind himself of the facts he has discovered during the course of his investigation and ultimately solve the mystery.<p>One minor fault. In the movie, Pearce denies a claimant his insurance money because he "proves" that his impairment isn't due to disabling neurological causes, but due to his lack of effort to remember. In fact, from the symptoms, the guy obviously has what's known as complete anterograde amnesia, which is the opposite of the famous retrograde amnesia that many people are familiar with and has been used equally sensationally in movies. Pearce doesn't believe it's real, or at least he can throw enough doubt on the case to give his insurance company a way out, and thereby deny the man his money. <p>I also enjoyed Pearce's role as the professor in the recent remake of the Time Machine. All in all a fine flick and worth seeing even if you're not into more thoughtful kinds of movies like this one.</p></body></html>

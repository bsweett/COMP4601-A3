<meta name="summary" content="The curiousity of The Day after Tomorrow"></head><body><p>The Day after Tomorrow was made, apparently, for one reason: To wow the audience with its special effects and for a few moments make us feel like we are also dodging tidal waves and tornadoes. In that way, for me, it succeeded.<br /><br />You can't approach effects vehicles the same way as hardcore drama's that are filled with the do's and do not's of life. You have to step back and ask: Do I care enough about these characters to worry whether they make it or not? I felt so. I am a massive Gyllenhaal fan, and can't wait for the day when Dennis Quaid gets to show off his true capabilities as an actor. (Check out "Frequency" or "Dragonheart").<br /><br />The Day after Tomorrow will no doubt become a show-off disc for my home theatre sound system, and for those who can be willing to have simple minded fun for a few hours this will be the showcase. Though I know some of the savor will be lost as far as scope, it will still be a good dvd to own. ~saos~</p></body></html>

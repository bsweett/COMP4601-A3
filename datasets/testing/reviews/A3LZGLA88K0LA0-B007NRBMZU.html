<meta name="summary" content="FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY"></head><body><p>THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT is a film that has many flaws and challenges the concept of logic, indeed.  However, as a time travel adventure, it offers some complex scenarios, and challenges the theory that if you change one little thing, the results can be overwhelmiing.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher does a convincing job as the young man who uses his childhood journals to travel back and try to change things for the better----each time making things worse for either himself or his loved ones.  Jesse James as the young badass Tommy is chilling; few child actors have conveyed such a sense of evil menace and complete psychosis.  Amy Smart does a good job in her many incarnations of Kayleigh.  The direction is sharp and imaginative, with the visual leaps in time handled quite well.<br /><br />The movie has a sad ending (at least in the director's cut), but it is fitting I guess since Kutcher was doing more harm than good in his attempts to recreate history.</p></body></html>

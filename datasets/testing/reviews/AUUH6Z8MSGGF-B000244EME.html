<meta name="summary" content="The perfect Blu-Ray for the original Predator fan!"></head><body><p>Predator: Ultimate Hunter Edition<br />Blu-Ray, released on June 29, 2010<br /><br />"Predator" is an iconic movie that started a series that led to another series of "Alien vs Predator." This first film was directed by John McTiernan and written by Jim and John Thomas and originally was released in 1987 and is getting the Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu-Ray treatment in 2010. The story is of a team of commandos with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger on a mission in Central America that are hunted by a highly advanced alpha alien.<br /><br />Some of the other rough, tough muscle men of the time in this commando unit are Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, and Richard Chaves. The Predator himself was played by 7 foot tall Kevin Peter Hall. Over the course of the film, the men are hunted down one by one while they try to deal with a woman along for the ride named Anna played by Elpidia Carrillo. Eventually Arnold goes man to man with the Predator in an epic scene full of explosions, water, and mud.<br /><br />This film really set the scene for a genre that mixed sci-fi, action, and horror in a new way. No doubt the Predator itself was freaky and scary, but there's the manly man element of fighting back with big battle sequences and the fact that the Predator is extraterrestrial to make it more interesting. It is a memorable film that still gets fans to buy memorabilia and t-shirts to this day and I bet they can't wait for the newest film, "Predators" to open.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is just crammed FULL of features. Here's a bit of a run down.<br /><br />First off, you can listen to commentary from director John McTiernan who provides quite a bit of insight into difficulties they had in production with too much jungle, not enough jungle, red suit dilemmas, and designing the predator. Also there is a text commentary which appears along the bottom of the screen like subtitles from Film Historican Eric Lichtenfield. It reads like the man would speak, not a pop-up video format. You can set it up to actually listen to the director and read the historian at the same time if you wanted to, but it's very confusing.<br /><br />There are multiple detailed making-of features and featurettes starting with the "Predator: Evolution of a Species - Hunters of Extreme Perfection" feature that goes through the first two movies and the creation of a script written with a part for Arnold taking Predator back to the jungle on another planet that got sidelined when it was decided to go into an Aliens versus Predators format instead. The understanding is that the new movie coming out, "Predators" is a manifestation of that script without the Governator. Another feature is "If it bleeds, we can kill it: The Making of Predator" which was clearly put together from interviews taken at the time of the filming and not current day reflection like the other. It tells of fun anecdotes competitive gym time and Jesse Ventura and Arnold measuring the circumference of their biseps. The "Inside the Predator" featurettes break down specific elements even more as well as certain "Special Effects" like "Red Suit Staring Down" and other scenes.<br /><br />There are several deleted scenes & outtakes, Short Takes with the Filmmakers, and an entire photo gallery and Predator Profile. Finally, there is also a sneak peek of the new film, "Predators" seeing some background footage and explanation of the premise.<br /><br />Basically, if you love "Predator", everything you ever needed to know about the movie or the making of it is in this Blu-Ray and it looks fantastic when you watch it.</p></body></html>

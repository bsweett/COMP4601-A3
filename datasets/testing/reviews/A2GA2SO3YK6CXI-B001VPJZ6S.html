<meta name="summary" content="An excellent drama!"></head><body><p>This movie was highly recommended by two teenagers, respectively 18 and 20 years old, so we decided to watch it together.<br /><br />The movie is about a diverse group of high school students who have committed infractions and are brought together to serve an 8 hour - Saturday detention.<br /><br />Featured are: Emilio Estevez who plays the role of the athlete, Jud Nelson who plays a troubled young man, Ally Sheedy as a rather strange young woman, beautiful and popular girl played by Molly Ringwald and a rather intelligent "nerd" played by Anthony Michael Hall.<br /><br />As the day unfolds, these young people start communicating, breaking the social barriers that set them apart and we see how the personalities surface as they share the issues of each particular family.<br /><br />The movie is excellent. It made us consider how dissimilar people brought together can identify similarities and become, if not friends, accepting of each other. Would highly recommend watching with teenagers as the movie works these personalities through the age where transformation into adulthood is taking place.<br /><br />After the movie we discussed this drama and gained insight on how the play was perceived by the group.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A great film with great performances"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this film, i was hooked from the beging to the end. The film was a flop when relesed becouse they relesed it in June when there his summer blockbuster this movie should of been relesd around oscar time. The story is excellent about a man trying to feed his family during the great deoresion. The acting was excellent and I think Crowe, and Zellwiger should be nominated for oscars. I liked the visualsa espesailly wne they show hoverville's in central park it was sad watching the people live like that. The movie is real and has a big heart espially whne Crowe makes his son return the meat he stole. I do not liek sports films so i found the boxing parts boring. Overall one of 2005 best films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If only for Clive Owen and Vincent Cassel"></head><body><p>Okay, was this made before or after "Rumor Has It?" Jennifer Aniston continues to convince me that her acting is pedestrian. She [is] one of those actors who just don't work in the big screen. She may have been fine on televsion but....she wrecked this film. I was very glad that she (Lucinda Harris) got blown away in the big shootout; unfortunately, too late in the film. The big shootout was the highlight of the film.<br /><br />Clive Owen as Charles Schine played his part very well. That being of the person victimized in a blackmail scheme by the sinister La Roche played by Vince Cassell and his convincingly scumbag accomplice Dexter, played by the one-dimensional Xzibit; whom I was also glad when he was blown away. I also enjoyed the final scene when La Roche gets it "stuck to him." After all the pain he put Schine and his family through. Yeah, even though it all because of Schine's attempted affair with Lucinda Harris.<br /><br />Oh, the storyline? Please read one of the "long-winded reviews."</p></body></html>

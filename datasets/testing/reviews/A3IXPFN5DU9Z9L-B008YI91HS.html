<meta name="summary" content="The T. Rex Wants to Hunt!"></head><body><p>Jurassic Park is one of the best Crichton film adaptations thus far. Though the screenplay is only marginally faithful to the plot of the novel, the basic premise, people being hunted by prehistoric beasts in a tropical paradise, remains intact.<br /><br />The animatronics and computer technology used to bring the film's dinosaurs to life have aged remarkably well, and the action sequences remain as gripping as ever. The fantastic video quality and available Dolby audio makes for a great viewing experience on wide-format TVs and surround sound systems. DVD extras are sparse for a 'Collector's Edition', but I normally don't care for special features anyway.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite films and it was certainly a crowd pleaser when it was released in 1993. Spielberg keeps the introductions relatively brief and once the action starts, it continues pretty much unabated until the closing credits. His knack for giving the audience what they want creates a few glaring continuity issues (ex: The T.Rex paddock seems to be at road level when when the T.Rex walks through the fence and between the two cars. Moments later, Lex and Grant must rappel down into the paddock, which is now a long drop down from the road.) but the film is so enjoyable that one hardly notices them.<br /><br />The relatively one-dimensional characters are nevertheless filled out nicely by the cast, with Wayne Knight in a great performance as Dennis Nedry and Sam L. Jackson adding his trademark, smoke enveloped cool. I can highly recommend this film and DVD version.</p></body></html>

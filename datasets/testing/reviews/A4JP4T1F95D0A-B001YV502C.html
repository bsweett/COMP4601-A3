While I do not think this is the best science fiction movie I have ever seen, at least it is written intelligently and rises above the generic action movies that usually dominate the field.  I wish Moore had more of a part in the film.  I think she is an incredible actress and her appearance is way too brief.  A lot of the how's and why's are left untold in this film.  Some find that interesting, many others want everything spelled out for them.  I would say this movie is for people who enjoy reading and enjoy something deeper than "Total Recall".</p></body></html>

This time the story is between two cowboys who spend time together sheep herding on Brokeback mountain in the summer of 1963 and continue their relationship for the next 20 years.  While the women in their lives suffer emotional neglect, the real angst in this movie is depicted in the moments when Jack and Ennis are spent apart.  It is said that absence makes the heart grow fonder, but Jack and Ennis feel its effects doubly so.<br /><br />The cinematography is absolutely stunning.  The soundtrack is quiet, simple and honest.  The actors are perfectly cast and well-depicted.  I was quite surprised by Anne Hathaway's performance.  She nails the Texas accent and the attitude of a wife whose marriage very quickly became a loveless convenience.  Additionally, our wholesome heroine from the Princess Diaries is no more after Hathaway's first topless scene with Jake Gyllenhall.  Seems like everyone is growing up in this film.<br /><br />Because the movie involves some very sensitve material that is not yet widely accepted by the public, I do caution to those who are uncomfortable with homosexuality that this film is not for you.  There are a few love scenes, short yet somewhat explicit, that might cause you to squirm in your seat or quite possibly gag.  Conversely, homosexuals would find this movie both sad and endearing.  You should add it to your DVD collection.<br /><br />This is a very good story, well filmed and by far Ang Lee's best work to date.  Meant only for the maturest and most open minds.</p></body></html>

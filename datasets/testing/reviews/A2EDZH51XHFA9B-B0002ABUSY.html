The basic premise is here (small core of survivors, shopping mall), but the execution is completely different.<br /><br />The new Dawn fits into the new "fast zombie" craze (Resident Evil, House of the Dead, 28 Days Later..., etc). You start off with a nurse (Sarah Polley, from Go) getting off at the end of a very busy day. She goes home, goes to sleep after some gratuitous shower sex with the husband, they wake up the next morning, and their neighbor has turned into a zombie. Uh oh. But not the shambling mound from a Romero movie, a zipping horror that can be across the room and latched onto your throat before you can say "go rollerblade somewhere else willya?"<br /><br />The nurse hooks up with a cop (Pulp Fiction/Holiday Heart's lovely Ving Rhames), the two of them hook up with three other survivors, the pragmatic type who still wants to save the world (Jake Weber [Wendigo/The Cell]) and the young lovestruck pregnant couple who just want to live long enough to have the baby (Mekhi Phifer, recently of 8 Mile, and  ER).<br /><br />You can already see the difference; more survivors (and thus more potential zombie food). But what the movie gives us in expansiveness it sacrifices in content; where the longer, slower original film focused on creating wonderfully complex characters, the new version is concerned with giving you blood and bodies. And lots of both.<br /><br />Which may be, perhaps, the only interesting comparison between the two. Romero's original has less blood, less gore, and by far a lower body count than does the remake. It got slapped with an X, this gets an R. Perhaps it's time to re-release the originals to get the funding for Twilight of the Dead? (One can only hope.)<br /><br />If you look at the new Dawn of the Dead as just another fast-zombie flick, you're probably going to enjoy it. As long as, that is, you liked Resident Evil and 28 Days Later... and didn't think House of the Dead was too terribly awful. Get ready for an awful lot of jumps, some groanworthy humor (especially of the sick variety), and a soundtrack that veers from unlistenable to downright insane (Richard Cheese's lounge version of Disturbed's "The Sickness"). Turn your brain off, you'll have a blast. It's only when you reflect on how much the original pressured you to turn on your brain that you start wondering why they felt the need to make this in the first place. ***</p></body></html>

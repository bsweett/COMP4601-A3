<meta name="summary" content="History Re-created (from a comic book perspective)."></head><body><p>The time: 1888.  The place: London, Whitechapel district (the Victorian equivalant to the modern Red Light district). Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) is a beautiful and buxom lass who's life in London didn't turn out anything like she planned, struggling just to survive working in the world's oldest profession.  Mary and her friends live a harsh existence. Their only comforts are their own companionship and the belief that their lives cannot possibly get any worse than it already is. But they do. Their friend (and former prostitute) Ann, is kidnapped from her home and disappears.  Days later a member of their fellowship is brutally murdered. The women realize that they have unknowingly become a part of a conspiracy in which they have no control and are being eliminated one by one.  Meanwhile, the gruesome murder of the Whitechapel girl has gained the attention of a brilliant police officer, Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp). Abberline claims he had visions about the murder. The dreams continue, more prostitutes are brutally murdered by an anonymous killer who is dubbed Jack the Ripper and claims that he has been sent from Hell, and Abberline becomes increasingly entangled in the wicked web as he falls in love with Mary Kelly and races to solve the case before she meets Jack.<br /><br />The Hughes brothers pulled off an impressive horror/suspense film with FROM HELL. At it's most basic level, the movie is a slasher movie. But FROM HELL is a slasher flick done with taste. The film is rather gruesome in certain sections and is fairly historically accurate. However, the brothers feared the possibility of a NC-17 rating if too much was revealed and used a great deal of restraint in re-creating the famous murders. It is a testament to their skills that they were able to re-produce the real-life terror felt at the time, but without displaying all the grizzly details.  Not only that but the historical re-creation of 1888 Whitechapel is amazing. Almost every minute detail is reconstructed to perfection.<br /><br />Johnny Depp captures the essence of the real-life Abberline despite the fact that the real Abberline was short, balding, paunchy, and lived to a fairly ripe-old age.  Heather Graham does a decent job of portraying Mary Kelly, though it would have been nice to see a more real-looking actress in the role--Graham is just too Glamour Girlish.<br /><br />There have been many Jack the Ripper movies made over the years, but FROM HELL is one of the better ones (despite the inprobable conclusion). The movie is based upon the graphic novel by Alan Moore and though their are several changes, the movie stays true to the spirit of the original text.  Just don't think about it too much.</p></body></html>

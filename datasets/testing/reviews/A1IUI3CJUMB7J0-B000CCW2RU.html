This movie was good but will be forgoten fast and we'll watch it in 10 years thinking this was cheasey just like 70's sci fi films. The movie was a bomb in the box office and I can see why but the film is pretty good it's not great but it's good. The story is good and original but it's why to long. The acting is ok but not great and the chase/action scene's are why to long.</p></body></html>

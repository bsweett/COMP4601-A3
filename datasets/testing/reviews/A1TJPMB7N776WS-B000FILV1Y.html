<meta name="summary" content="Failure to Ignite"></head><body><p>Arguably the best romantic comedy to be released recently has been the smart, witty "Two Weeks Notice" with the heretofore Queen and King of Romantic comedies: Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. Is "Failure to Launch" (a terrible title, by-the-way) and Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Mc Conaughey up to the level of Bullock and Grant?<br /><br />Yes and No.<br /><br />Yes in that both performers are dazzlingly beautiful and charming and very much fun to watch. And No in that the writing, pacing of "FTL" is no where near as intelligent and strong as "TWN." is<br /><br />With that said, Parker and Mc Conaughey as Tripp and as an extension Kathy Bates as Mc Conaughey's mother and Zooey Deschanel as Parker's loopy roommate are first rate which is a good thing as comedies often rise or fall on the brilliance or lack thereof of the supporting players.<br /><br />The premise of "FTL" is risky in that Parker's character, Paula basically makes men fall in love with and bond with her so that they will move out of their parent's house. But what happens to the men involved when they realize the ruse? Or more to the point when they realize that Paula's not really in love with them? These concerns are never really addressed properly and the film suffers for it.<br /><br />"Failure to Launch" is above average and saved from being a total disaster only by the winning performances of all the actors.</p></body></html>

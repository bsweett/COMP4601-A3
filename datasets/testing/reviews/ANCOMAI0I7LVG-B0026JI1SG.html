<meta name="summary" content="Deserving of the praise and admiration, a film that truly becomes a part of you..."></head><body><p>I made the grave mistake of watching this movie with my infant daughter a few nights back and by the time Frankie Dunn gets to explaining what `Mo Cushla' means to Maggie I was a complete and utter mess.  Yes, I'm an emotional wreck when it comes to films that tug the heart strings, and `Million Dollar Baby' is just that kind of movie.  It's funny because come Oscar season 2004 I was a huge supporter of this film but ended up getting caught up in the backlash especially with Swanks Oscar win.  It's a shame because I unfortunately shelved this film for quite a while allowing the opinion of others to influence my opinion of this film.  With the birth of my daughter I've been up plenty of nights with nothing much to do but watch movies to drown out the cries and `Million Dollar Baby' just so happened to be one of the first films I decided to watch again.  I'm glad that I did, for as much as it drained me emotionally by the end it helped remind me why I was such a supporter of the film the year of its release.  `Million Dollar Baby' is truly an astounding film.<br /><br />To me it's hard really to categorize this film.  If you haven't seen the movie you may want to read my review with the foreknowledge that while won't reveal the ending of the film I will divulge information you may not be privy to.  `Million Dollar Baby' plays out like two separate films.  There's the sports drama that unfolds throughout the first half and then there's the paced dramatic second half that has absolutely nothing to do with boxing.  What ties these two halves together is the relationship drama unfolding between Frankie Dunn and Maggie Fitzgerald.  It's one of the sweetest yet ultimately devastating father-daughter sagas in recent years.  What makes this all the more involving are the stellar performances by Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood.  They are so in tune with each other, so connected with their characters and with their cast mates that you believe them through and through and that is the key factor in understanding and appreciating this film.<br /><br />Maggie Fitzgerald is a middle-aged waitress who feels her life has wasted away without ever truly becoming what she wanted it to become.  Her family is a vapid void of who she used to be, a carousel of white trash self centered bodies who take what they can and give nothing but heartache.  They criticize Maggie for her dreams even when she attains them but welcome the checks she sends home every week.  Frankie Dunn is a trainer at the end of his rope.  He's losing his fighters because of his ethics and he's losing himself as he struggles to reconnect with his daughter who's given up on him years ago.  Maggie believes Dunn to be the best trainer there is and wants nothing more than to be his fighter, but as Frankie so bluntly puts it, he don't train girls.  Maggie is persistent though, and eventually she breaks him down.  He agrees to train her on the condition that she will find herself another manager when the time is right, but when that time comes he realizes he can't let Maggie go.  It's that realization that makes this film all the more heartbreaking.<br /><br />The movie is far more than a `down on her luck girl becoming a prized fighter' type film.  It's more about heart than anything else.  Stripped bare of its boxing backdrop and you have a film about the deepest most remote parts of love, a love that can only exist between families.  This is not about romantic or lustful love but about respect and admiration.  Hilary Swank plays Maggie with such determination, such heart that you feel for her, you love her every step of the way.  It's a shame to me that Hilary has only done two good films.  Watching her in this film and even to a greater extent in `Boys Don't Cry' it's hard to imagine that she's the same actress to give us `The Core'.  I can't decide if Swank is a good actress or a lucky one, but hating aside her performances in both `Million Dollar Baby' and `Boys Don't Cry' are brilliant.  I will admit that Kate Winslet's performance in `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' was better and more deserving of Oscar gold, but I can completely understand and get behind the academy's decision to crown Swank once again.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood also pulls out a fascinating performance.  The first time I saw this film I was so blown away but Swanks performance that I didn't truly grasp the magnificent portrayal of Dunn that Eastwood provides.  His subtle variations of emotion are so expertly mannered that I can't help but wish they would have handed him the Oscar.  He was so controlled here and watching his shift from arrogant and demanding to content and understanding to depressed and defensive as he comes to grips with Maggie's situation.  He was, in a word, outstanding.<br /><br />While I love Morgan Freeman and feel that his presence in this film is wonderful I am less impressed with his performance than with any other in the film.  His Oscar win in my opinion was undeserved for his character is not all that impressive.  In fact I feel that the idea of Eddie Dupris is more impressive than the limited amount of depth the script allowed for him.  He could have been a more powerful presence but he lacked something that both Swank and Eastwood were able to deliver.  I hate to single out Freeman as the flaw here because I truly love the actor but there really is nothing else in this film I can find fault with.<br /><br />In the end the film, including Freeman, is a masterpiece of modern cinema.  Sure it may appear sappy in some areas but ultimately it's rewarding in the same vein.  It's a truly extraordinary accounting of a beautiful relationship between a girl in need of a father and a father in need of a daughter.  It's a movie that will make the burliest of men cry and to me a film that can invest itself so deep in an audience as to evoke real emotions is a film that is deserving of all the praise it can receive.  `Million Dollar Baby' is just that film.  I'm sorry for ever allowing others to influence my opinion of you when I knew you were always a gem.  I promise to never let that happen again.</p></body></html>

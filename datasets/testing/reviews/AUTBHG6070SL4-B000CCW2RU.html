<meta name="summary" content="Above average summer flick"></head><body><p>Lots of good pieces come together, to make a movie that's a cut above the usual summer junk. I'd say that this is quite exceptional summer junk.<br /><br />The premise is a bit far-fetched, but only a bit. There's a farm where the livestock have happy, contented lives, right up to the day they trot cheerily off to the slaughter. The consumers never get a look behind the closed doors, and never deal with the true cost of the 'product' they buy. The livestock are human, though. One wakes up to what's behind the life they lead, and escapes with another.<br /><br />That plot covers about the first 20% and the last 10% of the movie. Everything in the middle is a wild chase, trying to recover (or at least cover up) the escape. That part is an effects-fest. It has great running around, lots of stuff blowing up, and helicopter gunships tearing around downtown LA. This was supposed to be a quiet operation, right? That's why the scriptwriters picked the one city where a shootup like a small war could be considered normal.<br /><br />The running gunbattles are good: cars, trucks, helicopters, and something that looks like a jet-ski with extra jet and no ski. A few things arent' so good, though. At one point, the evil board of directors decides to cull the herd, sending four generations (i.e. four year's worth of human clones) to the abbatoir, a $200M writeoff. We learn, however, that each clone has a $5M retail price. Ignoring retail markup, that's a loss of 40 'products', which I take to mean ten per year. It looked like a whole lot more people than that down in the farm. But hey, they're scriptwriters, not accountants.<br /><br />If you ignore all the implausible stuff and the adrenaline-rich chase scenes, there is a real point here. No sane human cloning proponent intends for thinking, feeling people to be slaughtered. No rational cloning opponent would object to discarding a smear of skin cells in a petri dish. Society as a whole has to work this one out, to draw lines between what's ethical and what's not, and to make room for different people to draw different lines. One purpose of art is to interpret science, and exaggeration is a valid tool for achieving that purpose.<br /><br />Mostly, though, it's summer SF adventure flick. Enjoy.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

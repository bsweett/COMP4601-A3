You get involved with a simple minded man, and see everything through him.  After seeing this movie, you almost feel like you know Forrest Gump.  You don't even expect the film to move you that much, but it does, and it takes you by complete surprise.  Tom Hanks is one of the greatest American actors, and personally I do not think that any one else could've even come close to playing that role.  All the suporting cast was vibrant and interesting.  The movie all around is a classic that will never be forgotten.</p></body></html>

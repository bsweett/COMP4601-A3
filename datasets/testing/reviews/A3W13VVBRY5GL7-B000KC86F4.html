<meta name="summary" content="Meh"></head><body><p>I *really* liked X-Men 2. I wasn't such a fan of the first movie, but I did appreciate that the writers and producers couldn't cram ALL of the characterisation and development of the characters into one two-and-a-bit hour movie - and it was a pretty decent first effort, as franchise sci-fi goes.<br /><br />This movie, on the other hand, is just pretty flat, all things considered. And, even though it weighs in at a hefty running time and contains a number of potentially very entertaining plot elements, it's still just... well, just plain flat.<br /><br />The problem occurs with the script: Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn's screenplay contains surprisingly little dialogue; most of the movie feels like a segue from one special effects sequence to another. In an age where it's so obvious on a movie screen as to what's real and what's not, one would have thought that the writers might have focused a little more on the characters that have kept Marvel fans loyal for the last almost-fifty years. Alas no, and what we're sadly left with is a thin and perfunctory sort of movie, where the characters, at least via their characterisation, come across as two-dimensional and wooden.<br /><br />Acting's pretty average - Ian McKellen in Magneto's more powerful scenes looks like he's suffering from 'Mommie Dearest' syndrome, Patrick Stewart isn't given enough to do, and Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry do great jobs at looking either A. Angry or B. Blank. The one high point on the acting front for me was Kelsey Grammer in the role of Beast - during the penultimate battle scenes he comes across as a whole and likeable sort of character, compared to Jackman's incessant grunting or Berry's woeful whining.<br /><br />And that was another big problem - with a credited cast of many, many people, why did this movie become the Hugh and Halle Show??<br /><br />All in all, this was a big disappointment. It will appeal to the rabid fanboy element, but for fans of action and science fiction, it's nowhere near the fleshed-out fullness of, say, 'Batman Begins' or 'Episode III'.</p></body></html>

It didn't air in the local theaters so I had to wait until it came out on video. There isn't nearly enough fantasy in a movie advertised to be a fantasy book. This is NOT a fantasy, it's a drama.<br /><br />this movie is was a HUGE let down. I mean, the movie was okay I guess, but to compare it to the LOTR is just wrong. These two movies have almost nothing in common, LOTR beats Pans Labyrinth in every movie category there is. The only category that Labyrinth comes even remotely close to the LOTR is in emotional impact, but even then everything was done so matter of fact in this movie I could only feel really bad at the very end. Normally if you throw a suffering little girl into a movie you automatically have me depressed (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00070Q84U">Grave of the Fireflies</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063K2C">Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056H26">All Dogs Go to Heaven</a>) but here it didn't. Why is easy to see. The girl in this movie is so amazedly stupid, which is made clear when she eats from a feast after being warned that doing so would result in her death. Even with fairies buzzing around her head and trying to take the good away from her, even which a creepy monster thing at the end of the table, even with pictures of that same monster thing killing hundreds of little babies, SHE STILL EATS THE STUPID FOOD!!! And its not just her, the house maid is such a bad spy that I'm surprised she lasted this long, and the doctor is extremely careless. They just don't act like real people would act, and in a movie that's character driven that's not a good thing.<br /><br />Then there's the meany step dad. Although he is one bad dude, and deserves to be hated, I've seen too many villains who are MUCH worse than him. Sure this guy is bad, but he could have been a lot worse. Until the end (when he was drugged up) the worse thing he did was torture a stutterer with his little hammer and pliers. Don't get me wrong now, he's a really bad guy, but he pretty much leaves people alone who don't do anything to him. It's not like he's going out murdering random people. By everything I was hearing, I expected him to be the worst thing since Hitler, but this guy is no where NEAR that bad. Come on now.<br /><br />just one question before I stop writing a review that I know won't get many helpful votes, do all Spanish people fight this bad? I know this isn't a war movie, but the fighting was so unrealistic it was laughable. The soldiers run around in the open missing each other at point blank range, and yet the main villain is able to pick people off at fifty yards with his pistol.<br /><br />Maybe I could have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't been expecting another LOTR, but that's the way it was advertised. Don't blame me for that. The acting was good, the special effects were good (but once again I was comparing them to the LOTR, in which case they came up short) and the script was great. Don't watch this movie expecting fantasy, because that's not what you'll get. if you read this review (whether you agree with me or not) please leave a comment.<br /><br />Replay value; moderate.</p></body></html>

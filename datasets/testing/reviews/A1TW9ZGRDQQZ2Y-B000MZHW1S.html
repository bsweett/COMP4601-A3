<meta name="summary" content="DiCaprio's other great performance of 2006"></head><body><p>Leo is only in his early thirties and has the potential to be the best actor of his generation. The Departed and Blood Diamond offer two very different, yet brilliant performances by Leonardo DiCaprio (though I do think he deserved the Oscar nomination for The Departed). Djimon Hounsou is great as well and deserved the Oscar nomination he got for his role here. The movie itself is more than just an action film, providing some food for thought. It is also paced rather well. What else would you expect from the director who brought us Glory and The Last Samurai?</p></body></html>

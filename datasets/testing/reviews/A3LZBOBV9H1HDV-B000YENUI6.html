<meta name="summary" content=""Eastern Promises" is brilliant!"></head><body><p>"Eastern Promises" is brilliant! The cast led by Viggo Mortensen (in a career-best performance as Nikolai), Naomi Watts (as Anna), Vincent Cassel (as Kirill), and Armin Mueller-Stahl (terrific as Semyon) is brilliant! The directing by David Cronenberg (who also directed "A History Of Violence" (2005), which also starred Mortensen in also another terrific performance as Tom Stall), is brilliant! The screenplay by Steven Knight (who also did the story and screenplay to "Amazing Grace" (2006) & "Dirty Pretty Things" (2002) is brilliant! The crew that worked with Cronenberg in "A History Of Violence" are back, as well. The music by Howard Shore (who also did the music to "The Departed" (2006) is brilliant! The cinematography by Peter Suschitzky is brilliant! The film editing by Ronald Sanders is brilliant! The casting by Deirdre Bowen (who also did the casting to "Shoot 'Em Up" (2007) & Nina Gold (who also did the casting to "Hot Fuzz" (2007) is brilliant! The production design by Carol Spier (who also did the production design to "Silent Hill" (2006) is brilliant! The art direction by Rebecca Holmes (who also did the art direction to "Dirty Pretty Things") is brilliant! The set decoration by Judy Farr (who also did the set decoration to "Hannibal Rising" (2007) is brilliant! The costume design by Denise Cronenberg (who also did the costume design to "Dead Silence" (2007), "Shoot 'Em Up", and the upcoming "The Incredible Hulk" (2008) is brilliant! This is brilliant, masterful, and intelligent! This is the best film of the year, so far. Cronenberg, Mortensen, and Knight should be remembered for their work, come Oscar time. This is just as brilliant, if not better, than "A History Of Violence".</p></body></html>

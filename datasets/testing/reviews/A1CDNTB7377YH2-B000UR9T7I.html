<meta name="summary" content="Definately way below the first two films!"></head><body><p>Being an enormous fan of Spiderman and greatly enjoying the first two films, I looked forward in anticipation to this film.  I was greatly disappointed.  There was just too much going on in this film.  Where Doc Ock and the Green Goblin were fascinating villains with powerful performances in the other films, the Sandman was a very dry character and Venom was comical like Danny Devito's Penguin in the Batman movie.  Additionally, Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane was all over the place and never properly resolved in the end.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the first battle between Spidey and Harry in his Goblin gear (though it is never explained how he mastered all the equipment and had a much bigger arsenal and better glider than his father).  Their succeeding conflicts do not have the same excitement.<br /><br />J. Jonah Jameson's character is reduced to a much smaller role than the other movies and I was expecting more from Doctor Connors and the University in this film.  Even Aunt May is reduced in this movie and her only good moment is when she says that she would not take revenge on Ben Parker's killer and would be happy if something happened to him.<br /><br />I put this film just slightly below the Ben Affleck Daredevil film.  Though the box office has been great so far, I think it will lose out on the repeat business from audiences (I saw the first two films in the theater three times each).</p></body></html>

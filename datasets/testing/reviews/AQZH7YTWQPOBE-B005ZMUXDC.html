<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining"></head><body><p>Tangled has probably received more popular attention than any other Disney animated feature since Lion King. It is quite entertaining and has some funny scenes. The film has a few running jokes, such as the use of a frying pan as a weapon and the intelligent horse Maximus. The animation is definitely a huge step above the traditional Disney animations and Rapunzel really looks beautiful. Unfortunately, I took off one star because the plot isn't really anything to write home about and is pretty predictable. It seems Disney put its effort into the characters and animation rather than try to develop an original story. Still, the movie's entertaining enough that you'll almost forget how banal the plot is. Overall, 4 stars.</p></body></html>

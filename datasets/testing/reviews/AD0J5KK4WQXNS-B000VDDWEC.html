<meta name="summary" content="DVD better than the Theatrical Release - TV more suitable."></head><body><p>I gave this one 2 stars for the theatrical release. I give it 3 stars for the DVD release but definitely this is a TV quality movie and that is probably where it will play best - after the Ten o'clock news on Friday evening. It was even shot on video (Canon XL1S).<p>The makers of Trainspotting have brought us a Zombie movie, only it is not a zombie movie, but it still is. The zombies here have been replaced by the infected, but for all intensive purposes they are still zombies... except they run. The premise is simple. Monkey experiments cause an infection to spread across Britain turning people rapid. Survivors try to make it to civilization. Cue lots of set pieces involving who is going to make it and who is not. The producers of this film often have posters for "The National Lottery" in various scenes as a movie in-joke gimmik.<p>28 Days Later has appeal in the realm of independent movie productions but certainly does not surpass the offerings of Romero or even Fulci for that matter. It has a social and psychological element that may move this into the category of intelligent horror, but at the same time the IQ drops a few points in various scenes. For example:<p>- Why are the army so crazed to rape women only 28 Days after the holocaust? (US soldiers in Iraq will probably laugh their heads off)<br />- Why do characters still walk into "traps"? (You know - when a character goes for a walk on their own or drive into a dark place.)<br />- Why hasn't the world done something about it? (Very plausible when you think about the ending.)<p>So some intelligence points granted - others subtract from this. Overall there is a good representation of England turned deserted except for zombies that "run" amok, some very violent scenes and a few interesting parallels between mankind and the zombies. Essentially it is a film of two halves. The first half takes place in London as survivors meet up, get killed and try to make their way to safety. The second half of the film takes place in a Military compound in Manchester. The film borrows heavily from - Day of the Triffids; man wakes up from a coma to find the world desolate, Day of the Dead; Army try to protect the survivors only to turn on them and they have an ex-soldier turned zombie to experiment on, The Stand; the scene in the tunnel is from that book. So 28 Days Later is not exactly the most original Zombie horror flick in the world, but the originality is in the direction of being more art-house than mainstream and for that it does look better than most but is still a no-brainer in the guts.<p>I'd watch it though for the video look (Canon XL1S) that is done quite well considering you can buy this camera on Amazon for $3,529.88. Independent filmmakers will enjoy that and heck so might you.</p></body></html>

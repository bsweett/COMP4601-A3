The movie is about a young boy who befriends an alien creature known as ET when ET is left behind by his mother spaceship. Steven Speilberg, who directed the movie, based ET on his imaginary friend that he made up in the early sixties when his parents divorced. To Speilberg ET was the brother he never had and the father that he was about to lose. The basis of the story stayed with Speilberg for years, if anything it haunted him, and it wasn't until the early eighties that he was able to get a script written and the project greenlighted by the studio. The movie was filmed in Southern California and most of the cast consisted of young child actors, sometimes an omen for movie makers. However, Speilberg got a taste of working with children after "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", and he has gone on record as saying the "ET" shoot was one of his most memorable due to his working with Drew Barrymore, Henry Thomas, and other kids.<br /> A film that never ages, "ET" has consistently shown up on "best movie lists" time and time again, with "Time" writing that "ET" is one of the best motion pictures ever.<br /> The DVD is filled with bonuses including interviews with those who worked on the film (now grown adults) as well as Speilberg, commentary, trailers, and more. As of 2010 "ET" has grossed nearly $800,000,000 making it one of this biggest blockbusters in movie history. The budget of the film was moderately low, at $10,000,000.</p></body></html>

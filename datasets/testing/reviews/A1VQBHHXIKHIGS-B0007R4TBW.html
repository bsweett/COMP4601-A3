<meta name="summary" content="Very Watchable"></head><body><p>The DVD cover hails it as a coming of age comedy, so I'll think of it that way.  It addresses the concerns I seem to recall having as a teenager, it handles everything very well, and I laughed more than once.  Yep, I can certainly see it being beloved by some teens.<br /><br />I'm knocking on 50, folks.  I saw some bits that were very effective, and some humor that worked quite well.  It seemed a bit surreal at first, but that's explained to everyone's satisfaction plot-wise eventually.  But my memory of my teen years was that they seemed surreal even as they were happening, no plot point necessary.<br /><br />So yeah, a fine movie, and I'm not even in its demographic.</p></body></html>

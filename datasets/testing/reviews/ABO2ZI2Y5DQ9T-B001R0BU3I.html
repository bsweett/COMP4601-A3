<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Political Thriller That Keeps You on the Edge ... Mostly"></head><body><p>"Traitor" is a thriller against the background of the present political climate in the world. Jeffrey Nachmanoff's political thriller is slick, well-acted and mostly riveting, but the film's convoluted (some may say incredible) story requires a considerable amount of suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />At the center of its globe-trotting story is two characters: the chased and the chaser. They are Samir Horn (Don Cheadle) and Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce). Samir is a former soldier selling explosive devices to radicals. Roy is a tough, straight-shooting FBI agent hunting down the culprits involved in multiple terrorist attacks in Europe.<br /><br />Samir and Roy had once met in Yemen. When arrested, a devout Muslim Samir is offered a deal from Roy, but he refuses. Later Samir escapes from a Yemeni Prison with another inmate Omar (Sa?d Taghmaoui). By the end of the 114 minute film, Roy and his no-nonsense partner Max (Neal McDonough) will know what Samir is heading for.<br /><br />"Traitor" keeps the viewer guessing right up to a certain moment, when the fifth major character steps in. From then on, things start to look a bit familiar, if not predictable, and its resolution is too unbelievable. Some may be reminded of "Body of Lies," released only two months after "Traitor." Like Ridley Scott thriller "Traitor" describes high-tech aspects of modern-day warfare, explores inner conflict of characters, and wraps up the complex storyline with a too-neat conclusion. "Traitor" is an effective thriller, but a second viewing will make you notice some major plot holes in it.</p></body></html>

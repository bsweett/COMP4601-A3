<meta name="summary" content="A movie best forgotten?"></head><body><p>"The Forgotten" is a science fiction movie featuring Julianne Moore, Dominic West and Gary Sinise.<br /><br />The actors are good, the concept interesting, but the movie never delivers. Unfortunately, I have to agree with the critics: "The Forgotten" is a film best forgotten. It comes across as a second-rate "X Files" rip off.<br /><br />The main character, Telly Paretta, has lost her son Sam in a plane crash. About a year later, all memories of Sam mysteriously vanishes, Telly's doctor tells her that she is delusional, and neither her husband nor her babysitter remembers anything. However, Telly finds one person who does remember: a former NHL player turned heavy drinker named Ash whose daughter was on the same plane. Together, they try to find out the truth about the missing children. Soon, both Telly and Ash are hunted by the National Security Agency. Before long, they realize that the federal government have struck a deal with a group of space aliens who abduct children to conduct weird experiments.<br /><br />It would have worked in the hands of Chris Carter. In this production, the idea never really takes off. "The Forgotten" isn't even scary, and only the first part is psychologically interesting. The alien is very bland, and the only worked out characters are Telly and Ash. The end of the movie is ridiculous. I got the impression that the scriptwriter didn't really know how to end the movie, and invented a "Pamela and Bobby Ewing" kind of twist, just to end it all!<br /><br />It's a real pity that "The Forgotten" wasn't better, especially since so many good actors participated in this project. In the end, it didn't satisfy anyone. It's too weird for a regular drama, too bland for science fiction, and not psychological enough for a psychological thriller.<br /><br />And now...sports.</p></body></html>

Exactly how did this woman of privilage go down in history as being one of the most reviled and hated?  This movie gives some insight on a few slightly off center methods.<br /><br />Born into the royal family of Austria, Marie Antoinette was sent to marry the crown prince of France, the doomed Louis XVI, in a strictly political rather than a love situation.  The costuming and sets are beautiful if not completely decadent, but how could anything not be in the palace of Versailles?  Unsure of herself, plus not knowing what to do with a husband who is more interested in his hobby of key making rather than her, Marie creates a core group of friends and has fun.  She parties and has a great time.<br /><br />The music was panned in this, as it truly did not fit at all.  Post punk rock music for 18th centure France?  Doesn't work.  That's what turned me off, the blatant marketing tactic, even casting Maryanne Faithfull as the Queen of Austria in a bit part.<br /><br />Eventually, Marie finds herself under pressure to produce and heir when her in-laws start having babies and the court starts gossiping.  She does produce the much needed for heir, thinking that this will be the end of her official duties.  The rest of the movie only hints at what will be their fate.  Marie and the others at court, as it seemed, really had no idea of what was going on outside the palace doors nor across the ocean.  Instead, Louis XVI would make some bad decissions, but she would stand by him.  Perhaps not as a wife or supporting him in his political decissions, but because she was truly ignorant.<br /><br />The movie ends at a very curious point.  Those who know their history know what their fate would be, but the movie chose to end at a point where if one didn't know anything about history you would be guesssing.  Marie and Louis flee the palace, going off as the mobs were closing in on them.  They were saying good-bye to their lives as royalty, and looking to an uncertain future.  THE END.  I would have liked to have seen just a little bit more.  This ending and the soundtrack left me lukewarm about it.</p></body></html>

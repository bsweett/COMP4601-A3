<meta name="summary" content="first rate biopic -  warts, genius, and all"></head><body><p>This is a wonderfully vital story of a man who made it to the top of his profession in a way that may be possible only in America:  he was black from the Jim Crow South, blind, and poor, but he rose by talent and guile, with many injuries along the way.  The portrait is completely believable and emotionally compelling, from his strong and wise mother to his devoted, yet long-suffering wife; both of them were essential to push this man to be a better person, in spite of his flaws.<br /><br />I was utterly riveted by this story, got a splendid introduction to his music, and felt wonder at the maelstrom of opportunity and racial obstacles that is this United States.  One of the best films I have seen in years.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.</p></body></html>

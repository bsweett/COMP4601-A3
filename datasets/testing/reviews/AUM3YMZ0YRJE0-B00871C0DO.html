<meta name="summary" content="great transformation scene, but the film lacks a cogent mood"></head><body><p>This is a pretty good monster movie with some truly fine actors, in particular Agutter.  However, unlike the classics of the genre, where a dark mood of foreboding and anguish build, this film strays into a comedy that didn't hold together for me.  You enter scary scenarios and then the actors get almost flippant, even sloppy in the way that they depart from the mood for a few laughs that don't add to the story.  For example, the nurse keeps meeting with a cute little boy who says, "no!", to everything she asks; this shows she is warm and it is touching, but it detracts from the plot rather than advancing it.<br /><br />In terms of plot, it is pretty formulaic.  Two American friends are doing Europe, when they stumble across a strange village.  Feeling unwelcome, they walk out into the rainy night only to get attacked by you know what.  One of mauled, but survives, hence is doomed to monsterdom.  He meets a girl who falls for him, lives up to the curse, and gets offed while she is looking.  One shouldn't  expect more than this, of course, but it should cast a spell that the viewer enters and can forget everything else for a time.  This it completely fails to do, in part by indifferent direction - it feels almost like they are making it up as they go along - but also because of the misplaced humor that pops up, like the bumbling policeman whose character is never developed beyond knocking over medical instruments under the eyes of a glowering boss.<br /><br />The best thing in the film is the transformation scene, which is one of the best and most graphic that I have seen in the genre.  It is well done, though the werewolf himself often appears stiff and puppet-like.  One comic twist that does work are the visits (as spirits in limbo) of his friend and victims, but even they are sometimes stupidly lighthearted.<br /><br />REcommended tepidly.</p></body></html>

(Perhaps it applies more strictly to women, but was never spoken for a lack of need.)<br /><br />My point being that when Andrea (Anne Hathaway) slips out of her frumpy plaid skirts and bargain bin sweaters and trades up to Jimmy Choo shoes, she becomes a remarkably efficient assistant to Miranda, the devil-in-Prada. No longer does she clumsily fumble her way down Manhattan streets with Starbucks coffees, bags of last-minute requests - no, now she has her hair done, is "decked out to the nines" (pun intended) and is one competent gal.<br /><br />Sorry, but that seemed a bit too Barbie-esque for me. One minute we have Barbie the flight attendant, for example, the next Barbie the CEO. All because of the clothes.<br /><br />Meryl Streep plays her character with gorgeous understatement - you can almost hear the soft hissing in her voice when she speaks. Anne Hathaway plays an interesting "Ugly Betty" character (for indeed, Ugly Betty seems to have used this for much of its inspiration, at least at Mode Magazine). Anne is hardly unattractive, hardly fat - she simply isn't representative of haute couture.<br /><br />There isn't much of a plot to the movie. It's more of a collection of events taking Andrea from a bungling assistant to a more successful assistant, and everything that you would expect coming along for the ride - a jealous boyfriend, a love interest that seems to appear in the story for one reason alone...that sort of thing.<br /><br />Yet it's an entertaining film. Streep is a delight to watch, as is Hathaway, especially in the beginning when she was growing accustomed to her co-workers looking askance at her. All-in-all, it was enjoyable and funny - if not great.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Charlie's Angels"></head><body><p>Charlie's private investigation company is addressed by programmer Eric Knox, owner of Knox Technologies, whose revolutionary voice-recognition software has been stolen. Charlie's Angels Natalie, Dylan and Alex are sent to place a bug in the system of bitter rival Roger Corwin, who is under strong suspicion. But after the deed is done, the Angels and their boss Bosley face the fact of a destroyed home base as well as Charlie's life in immediate danger. This is a stylish and entertaining action movie. The colors in this movie are vivid and fun to view. This is a really great movie that I enjoyed watching it is sheer joy and entertainment.</p></body></html>

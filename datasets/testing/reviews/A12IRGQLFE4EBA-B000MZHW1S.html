He appears to be picking his movies and parts carefully. There have been a whole genre of political movies made within the last 4-5 yrs or so that have been doing a very good job of getting out global information to the public -- which is what the American media should be doing but somehow cannot or will not. "Blood Diamond" is one of those movies that hopefully will make you think and reconsider your purchasing habits and how something so simple can affect other people (especially children) half way around the world.<br /><br />This movie is serious and worth seeing. It put me in a really bad mood, but also made me determined to monitor my purchasing habits so that I do not contribute to that vicious cycle which is war, greed and poverty.</p></body></html>

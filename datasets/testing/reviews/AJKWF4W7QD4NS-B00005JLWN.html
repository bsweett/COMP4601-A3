In this world, all of the population is devoid of any emotions for the sake of no war and human survival, and Cleric's are the ultimate fighting machines who keep the law while their own emotions are repressed as well.  When John Preston (Bale), the best Cleric there is, accidently misses his dose of his emotion supressing drug, he begins to realize what it is to "feel", and when he does he knows that all along he has been leading the wrong path.  Bale's moving performance is one of his best, along with his roles in American Psycho and Reign of Fire, but that is almost overshadowed by some of the best action/fight scenes to grace the screen since The Matrix.  Using the "gun-kata" technique, writer/director Kurt Wimmer creates an almost over the top showcase for some ultraviolent fights mixed with incredible performances from Bale, Taye Diggs as Bale's new partner, Emily Watson as a doomed sense offender, and Sean Bean who, even in a limited role, plays a very pivotal part nonetheless.  What I can't understand is why Equilibrium didn't see the release time it deserved.  It was only released in limited theaters which I can't understand why.  I found 2002's big "future shock" film Minority Report every bit as good as Equilibrium, albeit more fast paced, and I would have liked to see how it would have done had it gotten a bigger release.  My only complaint is about the DVD itself, besides Wimmer's commentary, we get a five minute segment with some interviews and various trailers (including one for Quentin Tarantino's upcoming new film Kill Bill) and thats it.  I would have liked to see a documentary on the gun-kata fighting technique used in the film, but oh well.  All in all, Equilibrium is a more than solid sci-fi dystopia portrait, and it is criminally underrated and more than worth seeing.</p></body></html>

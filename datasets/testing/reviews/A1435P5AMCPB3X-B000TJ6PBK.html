Not nearly as suspensful, nor scary as it could have been, and the pace of it at times made me a bit drowsy at times.  This involves Cusac who plays a writer who investigates haunted places.  One day he recieves a postcard with a hotel name and the room 1408 on it, and his curiosity gets the best of him, and he investigates.  There are a few subplots running along in this that try to build depth to this movie, and does it sufficiently, but overall the action/thrill, and unpredictability are not there to make this a lasting horror/thriller classic.  Worth a viewing if you are a fan of Stephen King.</p></body></html>

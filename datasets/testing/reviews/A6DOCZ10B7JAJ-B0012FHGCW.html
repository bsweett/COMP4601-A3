INTO THE WILD is an inspirational story about a young man that broke the chains of conventional thinking and walked his own path.  I was expecting a basic, feel-good story that can't escape a certain level of foolish sentimentality.  But this journey is much more complex.<br /><br />It's the true story of Christopher McCandless, AKA Alexander Supertramp, a young man who abandoned his life of luxury in order to quench his thirst for adventure.  He was a college grad from a wealthy family, but just had different plans than those that were laid out for him.<br /><br />He donated his $25,000 savings to the hungry and embarked on his quest of fufillment in the wilderness.  Becoming one with nature.  His journey had one ultimate goal--Alaska.  He was ill-prepared to survive the harsh elements, having just his rifle and a field guide for edible plants.  Sound a little crazy?<br /><br />Well yes, it very well might be.  But Chris was an educated man, plus he had quite an infectious personality.  People seemed to be drawn toward his free spirit, which was evident in his numerous encounters along the way.<br /><br />So I doubt he was totally naive to the dangers his brave quest entailed.  He was running towards something, but quite possibly away from something as well.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch does an absolutely amazing job in this role.  Sean Penn also does an incredible job directing this story.  It really captures the heart of this wayward adventure, which was courageous, admirable, and also quite delusional.  A must see film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="X-men Origins"></head><body><p>`X-Men Origins: Wolverine' is pretty much as the title suggests, a film looking at the back story of Wolverine and how he came by his Adamantium skeleton. This also looks at his relationship with his brother, who is excellently played by Liev Schreiber, after they fight in numerous wars together and then become estranged after becoming mutant mercenaries. Jackman plays this just like the other X-Men films, all gruff and angry and there is no real nuance to his acting, but for a gutsy, all action role you don't really need tenderness or finesse. There are plenty of fights and explosions here to keep action fans pleased and this also ties in the later films and introduces some of the characters we are to meet down the line. The story is pretty formulaic and you can guess nearly all the twists and turns from the outset, but for a reasonably decent action film and a worthy addition to the X-Men franchise this isn't too bad at all. This is good but not great.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

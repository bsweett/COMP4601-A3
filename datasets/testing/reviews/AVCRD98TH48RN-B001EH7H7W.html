I put this in my DVD player with all the negative critical reviews in mind, thinking I would then enjoy it more if I didn't expect too much.  No, sorry, this movie is poorly made comic book tripe.  The special effects are incredibly poor, looking more like video game nonsense than a big budget extravaganza.  When the Nautilus first rises and we are all supposed to be in awe of its immense size and grandeur, it looks more like a shiny toy on a blue screen.  Then there are the characters.  While I at first felt a kind of nostalgia at seeing the Insvisible Man, Dorian Gray, and Mina Harker from Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula,&quot; that feeling soon wore off and I was left with a motley cast spewing out one-liners and dumb babble.  Captain Nemo entering the picture was my first indication of downhill progress.  He looks and acts monumentally stupid, and is somehow able to perform martial arts like Jackie Chan.  Mr. Hyde is another poor creation, with obvious makeup effects and bad dialogue.  There are many plot flaws here, as well. The Nautilus, this huge vessel when first revealed, is then able to shrink in size and then traverse the narrow canals of Venice?  Mina Harker, a vampire, is standing in the daylight at the end of the film?  There were other scenes that were plugged in for time consumption.  One example is when Allan Quartermain is atop the Nautilus firing at red buoys being launched by Captain Nemo.  If there was ever a scene that needed to be cut, this was it.  The special effects are not special; the acting is okay in moments, but poor overall.  This is a really bad movie in virtually every way.</p></body></html>

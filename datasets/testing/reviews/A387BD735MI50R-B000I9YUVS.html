<meta name="summary" content="Some Striking Visuals"></head><body><p>This re-make begins lamely. Its cast of characters includes the usual modern angry young people who curse gratuitously at each other. Most of the men are out for some crude T&A; most of the women are cardboard cut-outs.<br /><br />The movie is poorly edited. I wouldn't have fully understood the reason for the haunting in this version of The Fog if I hadn't first read the blurb on the DVD cover. Too many scenes were cut out or spliced into the action too late to make sense. Director Rupert Wainwright does refer to some of the differences between the original cut and the theatrical release of this film. In his commentary, he talks about the concessions that had to be made "to the Studio" to satisfy budgetary constraints and to speed up the action of the film to hold audience attention. I hadn't realized that the studios still had so much say in film content. I thought that kind of power went out with Sam Goldwyn. All this information, along with a lot of insights into the problems connected with shooting scenes in roiling waters, does make for a better-than-average DVD Director Commentary.<br /><br />But there remain other problems with the film itself. One of these is logic. A hash of re-animation goes on here. And it's not always clear why one character becomes re-animated, while another stays dead.<br /><br />I almost had decided this movie was a waste of time and was ready to quite it mid-way through, something my penurious nature rarely allows me to do. (I paid for this thing and by golly, I'm going to see everything there is to see!) But I hung in there, and I'm glad I did. The movie gets better as it goes along. It is saved by a number of striking visuals. There is a death-by-splinters-of-glass scene that is almost beautiful by virtue of the choreographing of the glass. There are striking, Wyeth-like tableaus of the old man on the misty beach - the strange setting he sees there - the image of him being drawn inexorably into the water. Then the haunting that ultimately comes fully manifest out of the fog has real virile power. I don't think you will soon forget its final embrace.<br /><br />So this fog bank is worth peering into. Still, it left me waiting on the beach, scanning, hoping for the return of Adrienne Barbeau.</p></body></html>

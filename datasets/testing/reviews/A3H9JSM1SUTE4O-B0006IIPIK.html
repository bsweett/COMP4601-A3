<meta name="summary" content="5 STARS FOR BREAKTHROUGH MOVIE MAGIC"></head><body><p>Back in 1996, wannabe filmmaker Kerry Conran was holed up in his small Sherman Oaks apartment hunched over his Apple computer incessantly rendering segments and scenes for a trailer of an epic movie that only existed in his head.  Two years later he had an art deco tinged, vintage-looking six minute black and white teaser that would become SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW (Paramount).<br /><br />A screenplay was begun after producer John Avnet saw that short film in 1998 and committed to making Kevin's big screen vision a reality.  Two years later, shooting began in London with Kevin directing. Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie acted out every digitally storyboarded scene on a bare, blue stage.  All the globe trotting locations and huge aerial and underwater action set pieces were then computer designed with the actors seamlessly inserted.<br /><br />I mention these things because the art of this film is at least as important as the story. Set in the late 1930s, giant robots invade New York City and perky reporter Paltrow alerts old lover Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law).  Their daunting task is to figure out who's behind this attack and stop a conspiracy to destroy civilization in order to save the planet.  An idea that resonates on some level today.<br /><br />The exquisitely beautiful, period perfect, richly detailed results didn't connect to the full audience potential this breathtaking breakthrough film deserves.<br /><br />Extras include three informative featurettes on the art and making of this film and there are two superb commentaries.  One from the filmmakers and a lone producer commentary from Avnet that should be the model for all future producer commentaries.<br /><br />This DVD is highly recommended.<br /><br />Maybe there will be a two disc extended edition that includes the finished version of the important deleted scenes and a separate disc that actualy shows the digital artists at work creating the astonishingly detailed, beautifully executed visuals that look straight out of the 30s.</p></body></html>

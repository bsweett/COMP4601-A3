<meta name="summary" content="Burton Revisits His Gothic Roots"></head><body><p>Tim Burton returns to the kind of darkly comical gothic material that helped establish his career and reputation with Corpse Bride. He's also gone back to the same kind of stop motion animation that he utilized so memorably in The Nightmare Before Christmas. The director has even re-teamed with long-time collaborators Johnny Depp, Michael Gough, composer Danny Elfman and screenwriter Caroline Thompson.<br /><br />While the land of the living has a cold, almost monochrome colour scheme, the Underworld is a colourful place filled with all sorts of outrageous characters. There's a pub where a disembodied head is the head waiter, skeletons play pool in the background while others break into rousing musical numbers. This world is dominated by vibrant green and purple lighting with the pale (yet somewhat luminous) blue skin of the Bride. Like the Underworld in Beetlejuice, it is an infinitely more fun and interesting place to be than the land of the living.<br /><br />"Inside the Two Worlds." The filmmakers talk about the differences between the living world and the Underworld - mainly they were separated in terms of colour and tone.<br /><br />"Danny Elfman Interprets the Two Worlds." The veteran composer talks about the songs he wrote and his intentions behind them. He talks about the inspirations behind some of the songs, for example, Bojangles' tune was influenced by 1930s jazz music.<br /><br />"The Animators: The Breath of Life" examines the stop motion animation process done on this film. Mike Johnson did the day-to-day directorial duties while Burton acted more as a supervisor, guiding the entire project.<br /><br />"Tim Burton: Dark vs. Light." Cast and crew praise Burton's unique vision and it was his influence that allowed the film to be made utilizing stop motion animation, considered by many to be a dying art form.<br /><br />"Voices from the Underworld" focuses on the cast of voice actors assembled for the movie. It was very important to get the right voice for the right character. We see some of the cast in action, recording their parts.<br /><br />"Making Puppets Tick" examines how the film's puppets were assembled, the way they were sculpted and then painted. Burton would do the initial sketches and had the vision for what he wanted them to look like and then Carlos Grangel would design them.<br /><br />"The Voices Behind the Voice" allows us to watch a few scenes from the movie with footage of the various voice actors speaking their lines. It is interesting to see how much they get into the spirit of their roles.<br /><br />"The Corpse Bride: Pre-Production Galleries" is a montage of how various characters from the movie were assembled, including tests for movement and so on.<br /><br />Also included is a "Music-Only Track" that allows you to watch the movie with only Elfman's excellent score playing.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></body></html>

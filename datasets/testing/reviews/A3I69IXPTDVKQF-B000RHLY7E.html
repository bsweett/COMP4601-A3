<meta name="summary" content="The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Meets Death Wish"></head><body><p>Living up to the savage high mark set by "The House Of 1,000 Corpses", "The Devil's Rejects" is like "Death Wish" meets "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".  It's relentless vigilante-style justice vs. merciless insane horror, set against a backdrop of searing-hot deserts, barren roads and isolated motels and dwellings.  It starts shortly after "House Of 1,000 Corpses" ended, picking up most but not all of the plot threads, but turning in a quite different, though no less intense, movie.  The Firefly family's farmhouse is raided by a heavy contingent of the local law enforcement, starting the movie off with a massive firefight like something out of a western's climax, but put through a blast furnace and emerging darker, meaner and more vicious.  With the Fireflies on the run - dubbed the Devil's Rejects by the media after people see what's inside that house - Sheriff Wydell (the brother of one of the Rejects's victims from the first movie) leads the forces of cops and bounty hunters on the Rejects's trail.  The Rejects, meanwhile, both the hunted and the hunters, burn a swath of horror through the southwestern U.S.<br /><br />  It's extreme, disturbing, believable, and oddly cathartic in places.  The Firefly family contains some of the most sadistic and violent villains in horror movie history, and it's odd to see the 'other side' -  Wydell and company - on the offensive much of the time, bringing in a different kind of savagery to the show.  The acting is brilliant, the direction excellent, and the use of music almost unprecedented: the way songs from the 70s (the era the movie takes place in) aren't just playing on a stereo but are worked into the score in perfect synchronicity with the onscreen flow (at times taking place in slow-motion that speeds up to normal as the song's tempo increases; incidentally this is one of the only movies I've ever seen that made me conciously think of what a great job the film editor did) enhances the movie to tremendous effect.<br /><br />  A masterpiece of extreme horror; few movies this ferocious and deranged have ever been put together so perfectly.</p></body></html>

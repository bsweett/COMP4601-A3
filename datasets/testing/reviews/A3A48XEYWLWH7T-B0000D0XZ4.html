I found Ang Lee's treatment of the Hulk mythos to be interesting and compelling.  While some liberties were taken with the back story and creation of the Hulk, I think it worked out pretty well.  The pure CG Hulk himself doesn't detract but does serve to stand out against humankind and nature.  Banner's dad as the Absorbing Man was a bit of a stretch, couldn't they have waited for a Thor film for that?  Still, the effects for the Absorbing Man were good while he was on film.  Oh Jennifer Connely, where are those fit and full days of the HotSpot and Rocketeer?  You're too thin and look sickly now, it saddens me to have to say.  Overall the cast does a bang-up job especially Sam Elliot as Thunderbolt Ross.  Bruce Banner is adeptly played w/ wide range by Eric Bana.  There are some Crouching Tiger angles and sensibilities sprinkled about if you watch for them.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

They were hoping she'd been expelled, into hard drugs, anything but pregnant.<br /><br />Well, Juno (Ellen Page) was hoping that, too.  It took 3 pregnancy tests to convince her.<br /><br />Juno tried the abortion clinic first, but couldn't go through with it.  Her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) convinces her to check out the Penny Saver for adoptive parents--or as she puts it couples 'desperately seeking spawn.'<br /><br />She finds Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), who seem to be the ideal couple.  Vanessa has always wanted to be a Mom--and Juno and Mark have so much in common.<br /><br />"Juno" takes us through a year of young Juno's life, including her relations with the father of her baby and her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), school, and the pregnancy and aftermath.<br /><br />The film takes you on the gamut of emotions, but leaves you feeling good. I saw this film with my husband, who loved "Juno" as much as I did.  We'll probably end up buying this DVD, because it's well worth another watch.<br /><br />Warnings:<br /><br />Some mature subject themes may not be suitable for really young kids, but I'd definitely take my young adults to this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE WORLD IS TAKEN OVER BY ZOMBIES!!!"></head><body><p>imagine that, i bet that'll give a scare. i love zombies, just about any horror flick with zombies will make my day. when this first came out, i had high expectations for it, and boy it sure didn't let me down. the first was great for being what it was, mad props. george romero is a wicked man, in a good sense. he does magic with all of his zombie movies. old and new. it's hard to do it like he does, no doubt. but this one, no doubt was up there as well. my kind of thing, the living dead, the blood, the chase, the victims, chaos everywhere! i applaude it as well. and the fact that the zombies were faster was a good idea. i mean it's creepier when they're slow, but when they're fast it's just excitement cause you don't know if they're going to get you or not. the remake was a good one i got to give it to them. the actors did a really good job, ving rhames is the man. great actor, much respect for him. the makeup was great too, overall it was very satisfying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another great "flying swordsman" movie"></head><body><p>This is a class of movies I've learned to like. It features great fight scenes and wire work, but with a clearly non-western flavor. There's always a mystical, even magical edge that western movies can't capture with a straight face.<br /><br />This one offers more than most. It describes a set of encounters between Nameless, the Hero, and assassins that had tried to take down the empire-building king. In a unique bit of visual story-telling, it goes over those encounters again and again. Each telling is changed by a different bit of spin-doctoring, to the point that the viewer may give up all hope of knowing the truth (whatever that means) of the original encounters. This could have been very confusing, except that each telling is color-coded. By themselves, the tinted stories are visually appealing. As a set they work very nicely. The one constant through all but the first interlude is Moon, loyal retainer to one of the assassins.<br /><br />Good action/adventure with a little more depth than a comparable movie from the West, and people generally keep their clothes on. The good guy wins in the end, but you'll have to find out for yourself what that means.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

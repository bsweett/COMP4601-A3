<meta name="summary" content="Liked it more the Second Time!"></head><body><p>I saw this film in theaters when it came out 4 years ago and I really didn't care much for it. At the time I was only 15 and did not get most of the numerous jokes sprinkled throughout the film. I watched it again for the second time last night and loved every single minute of it. I never realized just how entertaining and funny this movie was. The entire cast was great, especially Tim Allen and Sam Rockwell(the expendable crew member!). If you haven't seen this film and you love sci-fi or comedy spoofs, check this one out.</p></body></html>

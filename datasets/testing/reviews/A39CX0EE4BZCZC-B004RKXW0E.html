<meta name="summary" content="It Lived Up To Expectations"></head><body><p>Well, this lived up to the hype, which wasn't an easy accomplishment. Toy Story 1 & 2 set the bar high so, frankly, I was expecting a disappointment. Thankfully, it didn't happen. In fact, it looks like they saved the best for last.<br /><br />With a bunch of reviews already here, there is no sense going into the story. For those who haven't seen it yet, three surprises stood out for me: (1) the high number of new characters introduced; (2) the darkness of some of them; this is not always a fun story; (3) the incredibly-touching last 15-or-so minutes.<br /><br /> Also, the artwork is at the usual high standard, especially some scenes in the last half hour at the dump yard, of all places. This is a "must" for Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Finally, what's really cool, too, is that the people who voice the main characters are still the same men and women who did the first two films, with the exception of Jim Varney ("Slinky Dog"), who died in 2000. It's great to still hear familiar and distinctive voices, such as those of Wallace Shawn ("Rex"), John Ratenzenber ("Hamm"), Don Rickles and Estelle Harris ("Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, respectively).<br /><br />Kudos to all those involved in making this film. They nailed the essence of "Toy Story" and how much loyalty can mean.</p></body></html>

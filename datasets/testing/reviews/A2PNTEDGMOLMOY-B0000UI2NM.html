<meta name="summary" content="Gorgeously gothic movie gets lost in ponderousness"></head><body><p>I suppose the one-line review of Kate Beckinsale's pseudo-horror star vehicle, "Underworld," would be, "If you're going to see one movie this year about vampires fighting werewolves in a gothic metropolis, make it this one."  Which could reasonably be interpreted as damning with faint praise.<br /><br />Len Wiseman's first directorial effort results in a visually polished, darkly handsome film.  Set in the present day in an anoymous gothic city, peopled with beautiful-yet-dangerous creatures of the night who live in fantastic mansions and drive hot Europena cars, "Underworld" offers plenty of visual thrills.  The aforementioned Beckinsale, clad in a uniform of black leather that makes Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman suit look bulky, stalks the night as Selene, the top Death Dealer for the vampires.  What does it say about the 2001 monstrosity "Pearl Harbor" that Beckinsale gives a more convincing performance as a vampire than she did as a WWII nurse?<br /><br />Using a host of flashbacks, examinations of powerfully-illustrated history texts, and voice-over exposition, the film tells us that the vampires have been at war with the werewolves, or "Lycans," for centuries.  Apparently, the lycans used to be the vampires' servants, but then got uppity.  There's also a smidgen of a "Romeo and Juliet" romance that played a role, but that's not the focus of this story.  While the war is sometimes fought with fangs and claws, it's also fought with guns and high-tech ammunition.  They stop fighting long enough to mutter ominous portents about "returns," and "prophecies," and "the war."  Nobody is having much fun being a vampire or a werewolf.<br /><br />And that ultimately is what "Underworld" boils down to - not that much fun.  It looks great, but despite the special effects (which are very convincing), there's just not that much point to it all.  Allegedly, Selene has a "romance" with a human, Michael (Scott Speedman), who is fated to play an important role in the war.  And there's also Viktor, a "hibernating" elder vampire who gets brought back to life by Selene "a century ahead of schedule."  There are a few delicious moments as god-of-camp Bill Nighy ("Love Actually") sinks his teeth into the Viktor role, but there could have been so much more here.<br /><br />While ostensibly a movie in the "horror" genre, it's really more of an action film.  There are no moments of genuine terror, and most of the potentially scary moments dissolve into hastily-cut action scenes.  This isn't a criticism, just an observation about a movie that was hyped (at least to me) as a horror film.<br /><br />There's a bit much going on with the names in "Underworld."  When a sleazy vampire is named "Craven," you're crossing the line from "showing" to "telling."<br /><br />You do have to give the filmmakers credit for cojones, however.  The movie is an obvious set-up to a series, and it takes some serious confidence if you believe that you are guaranteed a series of big-budget films based on this visually-splendid trifle.</p></body></html>

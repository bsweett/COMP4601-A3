But whatever you choose to call it, this is one of the sleekest and slickest caper movies you're ever likely to run across, and what you're really going to end up calling it is pure Entertainment (yes, with a capital "E").  Incomparable escapist fare, impeccably crafted and delivered by director Steven Soderbergh and a dynamite cast, "Ocean's Eleven" is a joy ride that gives you a chance to root for the bad guys and feel wickedly good while you're doing it.  Because, after all, what's so bad about a bunch of regular guys ripping off a bazillionaire casino owner, who in the first place isn't such a great guy himself?  Remember, the key word here is "escapist"; don't worry about moralizing while you're watching this one, because a movie like this is made to let you to live vicariously for a couple of hours, so just sit back, relax and go with the flow.  Just remember:  These are professionals; don't try this at home.<p> When Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from prison, he doesn't waste any time.  Taking a rather indirect route after leaving the place he's called home for some time, he winds up in Las Vegas where he quite simply plans to rob three casinos owned by one Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), an extremely meticulous businessman, who is also-- if his reputation serves correctly-- an extremely ruthless individual.  He's not a guy you want to mess with.  So why does Ocean want to pick on Benedict, who has the means and the muscle to crush him like a bug with a mere nod of his head?  Suffice to say it has something to do with a personal agenda, as well as the possibility of a paycheck worth around $160 million, which-- even after splitting with the ten other guys he's about to recruit for the job-- will land him a share that won't be too bad for a day's work.  And, of course, there's the challenge; Danny Ocean and his buddies are about to attempt the impossible.  What he is proposing is something that has never before been accomplished, a gamble with nearly insurmountable odds; but, hey, this is Vegas-- and that's what it's all about.<p> To be sure, Soderbergh had the deck stacked in his favor right out of the chute with the cast he assembled for this film; but like any self-respecting odds-makers in Vegas will tell you, nothing is a sure thing.  Soderbergh still had to mix all the ingredients just right-- cast, story, photography, music, action, humor-- to make it cook.  Well, he may not get the Oscar for Best Director for it, but if there's a Golden Chef's Hat Award, he's a shoo-in for preparing this feast.  This is a veritable smorgasbord for the senses; it's easy on the eyes, it'll give you some laughs and make you feel good, it's easy to digest and in the end is a totally satisfying experience.  There may not be anything ground breaking about this movie, and certainly nothing especially new, but Soderbergh presents it with nuance and finesse, as well as that special artistic touch of his that is so definitive of his work.  Neither was a haystack anything new in Monet's day when he chose it as a subject for one of his paintings, and the rest is history.  It's how the artist renders the subject on canvas that's important, and it is in this that Soderbergh excels.  <p> As Danny Ocean, George Clooney demonstrates that he has the charm of Grant, the magnetism of a young Brando and the down-home agreeableness of Jimmy Stewart.  With his personality alone, he defines Ocean in no uncertain terms.  From the opening frame you know exactly who this guy is.  Still, there are a few surprises along the way that keeps him interesting.  Mostly though, he's just enjoyable to watch as he puts his plan into action, and it's easy to believe he's who he is and doing what he's doing.  And that's part of the charm of this movie and, moreover, goes to show you what a good performance Clooney actually gives here.  Unlikely as the story may be, he sells it in such a way that it works; and as the customer, you not only buy it, but walk away with the extended warranty and go home satisfied.  And that's a good bit of acting in anyone's book.<p> And though Clooney is clearly the star of the show, Brad Pitt checks in as Ocean's friend, Rusty Ryan, and emerges on fairly equal footing with his illustrious co-star.  Like Clooney, Pitt turns on the charm and serves up Rusty as a credible enough figure, with a performance that may not be much of a stretch for him, but one that is certainly engaging.  The character is lacking somewhat in depth and definition, but Pitt manages to give you a clear idea of who Rusty is without too much by way of development.  Call it a fast-food characterization; nevertheless, Pitt does a good job, and for all intents and purposes, he makes the character work.  <p> The single question mark in the casting may be with Julia Roberts as Tess, Ocean's estranged wife.  She looks good and gives a solid, if not memorable performance, but she seems to miss the mark slightly in capturing the true essence of the character, which may have been better served by someone like Catherine Zeta-Jones or even Rene Russo.  But that's a purely subjective observation, and I'm sure there are those who will argue that Roberts was perfect for the role.  In either case, Tess is an integral part of the story, and Roberts neither enhances nor distracts from the overall proceedings; most importantly, she does make Tess believable.  And in the end, with a terrific supporting cast (too lengthy to mention here), "Ocean's Eleven" is one you don't want to miss.</p></body></html>

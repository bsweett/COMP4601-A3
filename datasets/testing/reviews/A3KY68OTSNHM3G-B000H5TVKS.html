That left no question in his mind who was behind the killings: Jigsaw himself.  At first, Matthews is reluctant to get involved in the jigsaw case, but with a little prodding from his partner Kerry (Dina Meyer) and a sudden realization on his part, Eric finds out where Jigsaw is hiding out and moves in for the capture.<br /><br />However, unknown to Eric and Kerry, capture was part of Jigsaw's plan.  He has captured eight more unsuspecting hostages and locked them in a house which is slowly being contaminated by poison gas.  To make matters worse, one of the intended victims is Eric's own son Daniel (Erik Knudsen).  All of the hostages have one thing in common; they were all set up by Detective Matthews in order for him to gain a conviction.<br /><br />Jigsaw has supposedly hid vials of antedote throughout the house which will counter-act the effects of the poison, but there are other clues as well.  Each person has a number drawn on the back of their necks.  These numbers form a combination to a safe which contains the antedote.  It soon becomes apparent that the only way the hostages will survive is to work together, but that idea soon goes out the window, and everyone is looking out for themselves and not worrying about anyone else.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jigsaw and Detective Matthews have begun an interesting interaction of their own.  Jigsaw practically tells Matthews the location of his son at the beginning of their conversation, but Matthews, in his rage, misses the clues.  Soon, Matthews loses all of his patience and unleashes his own attack on Jigsaw.  Will Detective Matthews find his son before its too late?<br /><br />I thought the first movie was good, but this one is even better.  The plot of this movie is excellent, and the high point of the film is its surprise ending.  It will leave you spellbound.  I highly recommend this movie.  The acting is very good, and the twists and turns will keep you glued to the screen.  This movie is a must for horror movie fans and people who saw the first film.  Watch this great sequel; you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

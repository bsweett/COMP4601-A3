This is what happens when a recovering addict "forgets" to pay her bills, and three innocent people ending up losing their lives in the process.  It's amazing how her irresponible lifestyle affected others around her, she spun a pretty sticky web.  Her cop boyfriend was no prize either, giving police officers a bad name.  I think he should have had a worse fate than just jail.  Jennifer Connely and Ben Kingsley did great jobs making the story believable, they had me sold.  The ending did the movie justice, I was hoping she didn't end up with the house considering all the damage she caused.  One thing I didn't like is how the movie was spun in her favour, making the Middle Eastern family out to be the villians.  All the while I was thinking, oh here we go again, poor little white girl doesn't get her way so the world should stop and give her what she wants.  This all boils down to a sense of entitlement.  I'm sorry life doesn't work that way, and I'm glad the movie recognized that and had a fit ending to a compelling story.</p></body></html>

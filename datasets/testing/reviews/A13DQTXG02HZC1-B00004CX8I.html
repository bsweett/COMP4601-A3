All these years, I could still remember vividly the Chief (the Indian that was as big as a tree trunk)and the anti-establishment McMurphy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson).  It's like walking down the memory lane when I gotten myself the DVD rendition of the movie.  With advent of digital and Dolby technologies, now I am able to appreciate this movie in its full glory.  This is one of those movies that typified the triumph of the human spirits, about those rare individuals who are courageous enough to go against the grain.  What made this offering special is that this new version contains more than ten deleted scenes; behind-the-scenes where the older Danny De Vito, Christopher Lloyd, Bo Goldman, Saul Zaents, Milos Forman, Michael Douglas, Christine Fletcher talked reflectively and candidly about their involvements.  It's rather intriguing to know the effort that they went into just to source the Indian; Milos Forman comparing this movie with his ex-country Czech where people lived under the repressive regime and thus, him being the right Director for the movie; the hardship in trying to find a backer to finance this movie; Burt Reynolds was in contention to play McMurphy's character and so forth.  Over the years, this movie hasn't aged a bit and it still manages to captivate this very humane story.  Now with all these additions, it makes it a more worthwhile investment to revisit our memory yet again.  At times, old wine does get better with age.  If not been preserved correctly, as you know better, wine would be transformed into vinegar. In this instance, it doesn't happen.  Highly recommended and salute to all of those involved for been brave enough to make a movie that they believe should get made at the first place.</p></body></html>

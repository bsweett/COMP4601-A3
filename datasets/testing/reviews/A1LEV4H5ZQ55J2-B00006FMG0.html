<meta name="summary" content=""We're all murderers in this room""></head><body><p>When Michael Sullivan's son and wife are murdered, Michael takes it too personal.<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a very credible gangster from the 1930s and is supported by the strong but not too lengthy appearances of Paul Newman and Daniel Craig (who went on to become the newest 007 James Bond).<br /><br />Although set in the 1930s the style is modern and the sequences paced to entertain.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money.</p></body></html>

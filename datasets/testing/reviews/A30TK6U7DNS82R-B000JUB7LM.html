<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood's Tears"></head><body><p>We've seen many different kinds of fi;m from Clint Eastwood over the years, but this one is unique.  Halfway through the movie an event occurs which causes the audience to sit up and groan with shock.  After this event, the movie becomes a very different kind of viewing experience, a film almost European in its insistence on philosophical type questions about what is the meaning of life, and how does the quality of life differ from its quantity?  Eastwood himself shows off more sides to his character than ever before.  His talks with his parish priest will leave you in stitches, because he's so ornery.  And yet he will bring you to tears later on in the movie by confiding in the same priest a great dilemma he has to resolve for himself.  Eastwood has aged like a old stone figure from Easter Island, and there are grooves running vertically right down each of his eyes that seem made to channel tears.  Morgan Freeman also does excellent work in this.  If you are tired of Freeman "being Morgan Freeman" in each of his recent movies, rest assured, this is a part with some real meat on it and shows you what a talented actor he really is.  Dramaturgically, the weight of the whole movie rests on his performance and his ability to react to the chemistry and plotline between Eastwood's and Swank's characters, and he pulls this off marvelously.<br /><br />I didn't want to see this movie because I didn't want to see Hilary Swank butching it up again.  Is that awfui of me to say?  But indeed I shouldn't have been so gloomy about her.  She is great in this movie, from beginning to end, she gives it an oddly life-affirming glow.  Her soul shines through even under the most adverse of conditions (I dare say no more for fear of spoiling the movie for you) and she looks beautiful.  She plays a boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald, on whom Eastwood bestows the ringside monicker "Macushla."  Throughout the film she keeps asking him, what does Macushla mean?  I found it odd that the curious, alert Maggie would never have researched the answer herself, but when she finds out what it means, you will be bawling your head off and leaving the theater in a mist of tears.  Go to see it yourself and you will be grateful that in our modern age, one man has the courage to go back and try to re-tell the world's oldest story and this time, he gets it right.</p></body></html>

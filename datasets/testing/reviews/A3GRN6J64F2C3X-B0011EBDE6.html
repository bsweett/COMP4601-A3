An eclectic soundtrack and some genuine emotional depth are other plusses.  Extra features on the DVD are few but interesting; they include a short film, "Hotel Chevalier", that functions as a kind of prologue to "The Darjeeling Limited", and a twenty-minute or so glimpse behind the scenes of the making of the film.</p></body></html>

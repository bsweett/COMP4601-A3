<meta name="summary" content="Crude humor yet still funny"></head><body><p>Cleverly editted film using tongue-in-cheek humor in a candid camera/jackass kind of way.  The plot is simple, and the parody of Kazakhstan makes for a cliched start.  However, the best parts of the film are Borat's hilarious adventures in America.  Cohen must have picked up a few pointers from his psychologist brother because it has definitely served him well with this film.  Clearly a hoot and eye opener on real Americana. The jokes on us, folks!<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch despite the naked-wrestling scene.</p></body></html>

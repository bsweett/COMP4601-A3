<meta name="summary" content="It's good to be Queen"></head><body><p>This film details Queen Elizabeth's (Helen Mirren) reaction to Princess Diana's death and her relationship with new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen).  As Elizabeth clearly distains the Princess and finds her death just one more in a series of irritations, she wants to keep the mourning and funeral of her former daughter-in-law private.  Blair, however, thinks that would harm the monarchy in the eyes of the people who loved Diana, and urges the queen to go to London to speak publicly, fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, and be seen grieving.  Though she despises public displays of emotion, she reluctantly agrees.<br /><br />Mirren gives a flawless impersonation of Elizabeth and James Cromwell is equally fine as grumpy Prince Phillip.  Sheen gives a sympathetic performance as Tony Blair, a young man who hopes to bring the monarchy into the modern age.  The palatial sets are grand and the "behind the scenes" peek at the Queen's private life is certainly enjoyable, but, as a non-Brit, I found the plot rather inconsequential and pointless.  The movie is impressive but ultimately forgettable - excellent acting and production values but a narrow subject of limited appeal that lacks a satisfying conclusion.</p></body></html>

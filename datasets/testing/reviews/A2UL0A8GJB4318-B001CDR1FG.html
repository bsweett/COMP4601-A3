<meta name="summary" content="In the Opinion of the Humble..."></head><body><p>The &quot;Hulk&quot; is a good movie, often times great.  The first half of the movie is a long, methodical character study of people under immense emotional torture, especially Bruce Banner (a pitch-perfect Eric Bana) and Betty Ross (Jennifer Connely).  It is hinted that they share a dark past filled with absentee fathers and a secret military project that they might now be working on again, 30 years later.  This first half or so is the reason why the &quot;Hulk&quot; was not well recieved among viewers and critics.  People were expecting either another &quot;Spiderman&quot; or another &quot;X-Men&quot; or its sequel, filled with those films'  brimming everyman qualities and light-pacing throughout, or the Hulk of the 70s t.v. show, who aided people when he had and anger spell.  But director Ang Lee opted for a more tragic approach, with plenty of Freudinized angst, along the lines of repressed memories manifesting themselves in dreams.  And while Lee sometimes overdoes it, his decision ultimately makes &quot;Hulk&quot; far more interesting than the t.v. show whose premise wore thin after a few episodes and a little more intriguing than Marvels past comic-book adaptations .  However, action junkies need not fear.  Things kick into high gear in the film's fast-paced and action-packed final act as Banner escapes from a military compound where they were hoping to harvest him for their own purposes.  He then proceeds to tear up the california desert in a wondrously shot sequence that shows off the ILM's incredibly life-like and belivable Hulk creation and the films' unique style of editing that makes the film feel like a comic-book with skillfully juxtaposed images from various camera shots that describe various scenes that occur simaltaneously in the film.<p>It should be said, though, that &quot;Hulk&quot; is not  as artistically accomplished as Director Lee's &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; or perhaps other acclaimed films in his catalog.  &quot;Hulk&quot; at times suffers from uneven pacing, some mind-numbing psycological probing and timid acting.  But overall, &quot;Hulk&quot; stands on its own as a dark, brooding and  spectacular comic-book adaption that had the balls to take the &quot;Hulk&quot; to places no one ever expected something like the &quot;Hulk&quot; to go.  And while having the guts to do something daring is instantly laudable, &quot;Hulk,&quot; even with its flaws, still succeeds surprisingsly well.</p></body></html>

They completely inhabit their respective characters, in two performances that will easily remembered as the best of the year.  Oscar nominations will be well deserved for both. This is a profound, funny, sad, and totally heartwarming film that is all about the way resentment and bitterness can turn us into monsters and prevent us from just getting on with our lives.  But the movie is also about the enduring resilience of love in the face of seemingly incongruent and competing odds.<br /><br />Joan Allen stars Terry Wolfmeyer, a woman, who living a palatial life in a ritzy suburb of Detroit, is suddenly - and seemingly inexplicably jilted and abandoned by her husband. Full of bitterness, she rages through life like a modern-day Medea, drowning her sorrows and calming her rage in a steady diet of vodka tonics. Her days resemble a drunken haze as she takes out her anger and resentment on her four teenager daughters: Hadley (Alicia Witt), Emily (Keri Russell), Andy (Erika Christensen), and Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood).<br /><br />When her affable neighbour Denny Davies (a terrific Kevin Costner) pops over for a visit, Terry, being her usual gruff self tells him to get lost. But the persistent Denny sees a drinking buddy in Terry, and he manages, with a mixture of drafty resilience and genuine affection - to weasel his way into her life, and the lives of her daughters. Denny is a washed-up champion baseball player, and part time local disc jockey and makes a meager living by cashing in on his once famous name. These days he spends much of his time getting drunk and stoned, so with beer can and improper chuckle in tow, he welcomes the opportunity to plop himself unceremoniously onto the sofa, stay for dinner, and just hang out until he becomes a fixture in the Wolfmeyer household.<br /><br />Of course, one thing leads to another, and Denny and Terry fall into an uncertain affair. She is complex, bitter and difficult, while he is affable, likable and a calming force to her tempestuousness.  Along the way we see Terry try to forge an often problematic and uneasy relationship with her daughters and their reaction to her is often an anxious mixture of support and disgust at her drunken, self-absorbed ways. They run the household - from cooking dinner, to making their own school lunches, while Terry hangs out drinking and sparring with Denny.<br /><br />Kudos must certainly go to Allan and Costner who have created marvelous portraits of two middle-aged drunks wrestling with life's pain and regret. Both are self-confessed alcoholics, and while their drinking brings them together, it also forces them to confront some unpleasant truths about themselves and the way they are running their lives.  The supporting cast also turns in realistic, nuanced performances, especially Binder himself as Shep, Denny's show producer and sidekick.  Shep is another mess of unappealing contradictions who seduces young Andy and instills in us  - and in Terry - a mixture of disgust and admiration at his shallow honesty.<br /><br />But the film mostly belongs to Joan Allen. Her portrayal of a woman who just won't place nice, who readily berates and yet loves her daughters, and clenches her neck muscles in mixture of resentment and vulnerability - is one of the great moments of screen acting. She has a fierceness and a severity that is almost exhilarating and it's easy to see why Denny steadily becomes attracted to her. Whether she is hurriedly gulping down a drink so that she can cope with Hadley's graduation, or icily criticizing Emily for not going to the "appropriate" arts college, she is a character that one is not likely to forget anytime soon.

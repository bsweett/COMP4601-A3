I was a little afraid of a dark, weird version of the story messing with my fond childhood memories. The cartoon version is a classic and Disney knew that classics should not be remade, even when it is their OWN classic! The new version is colorful with some dark undertones but it's a fun movie and it's kid friendly. It also is a totally different storyline from the original where we see a 19 year old grownup Alice who remembers little of the strange dream she had as a child.<br /><br />I think the movie did a good job of being different and original as well as bringing back our favorite old characters only in a human form. I really liked Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter! The Red Queen was especially mean even more so than in the original and she was on the brink of being annoying. Anne Hathaway overacted a little bit in her role as the White Queen though usually she is great in fantasy-like roles like this. I think it was partially the White Queen's makeup too, I thought it was a little harsh. Otherwise the costumes were awesome...and at least the question is answered that many little girls asked when they saw the cartoon, "How does Alice's clothing grow and shrink with her?" LOL! Well, we see her go through several wardrobe changes throughout the movie so the new generation finally has an answer to this question!<br /><br />Personally, I think Tim Burton could have added a little more color and fun. Wonderland (now Underland...what is up with the title?) should be a bright, colorful place. Tim also missed the mark a little bit in other areas too. The very nature of the "Alice" story had a paradoxical, crazy, dreamy kind of vibe. What we see is a gray, dark world that is in ruin because of the evil Red Queen. I would have LOVED to see the White Queen change it back to the colorful, happy place I remember in my childhood but that doesn't happen. It has a good ending that I don't want to spoil but it still left me wanting the crazy, fun and wacky Wonderland that we all are familiar with.<br /><br />Then again, this is a Tim Burton movie so a lot of it was sort of what I expected. Personally, I think Tim has done ENOUGH with the 'dark' theme. His movies are starting to all look the same. I do appreciate the gift he has for thinking outside the box. Unfortunately though, I think he needs to look outside the box when it comes to his style! I would like to see him make something that is just as flashy and eye catching but that has a little bit lighter of a feel. His work is becoming predictable.<br /><br />I think they should have chosen a different title for this movie like "Return to Wonderland" or something like that. It isn't the same story as the original and the name is a little misleading. It is rated PG and this seems appropriate. It IS definitely more of a kid's movie but it does have a lot of action and intense scary music that might be a little much for very small children. I did like this movie and I was entertained. It wasn't boring and would probably hold the attention of kids or adults who are into kid's movies. I would probably watch it again though I don't think I would pay to see it. Honestly, Disney's animated version was better and I would rate it five stars in a heartbeat! Tim Burton's version in my opinion is only worth 4 stars. It was a good movie but it wasn't a great one. It is MUCH better than Tim's terrible "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" remake but I still felt like something about this movie was missing...hence the reason my rating is missing a star!</p></body></html>

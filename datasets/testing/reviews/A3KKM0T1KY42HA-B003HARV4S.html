In contradiction to whatever it was that set my expectations low, I will set yours relatively high.<br /><br />The Illusionist was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. And it's basically a 4-person show by Edward Norton (Eisenheim the Illusionist), Paul Giamatti (Inspector Uhl), Jessica Biel (Sophie) and Rufus Sewell (The Crown Prince); All 4 giving real A-list performances.<br /><br />Perhaps my low expectations were because The Illusionist was released right around the same time as Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, and I therefore at the time had a case of Magician-Movie-Overload. Regardless, I'm glad I opted to spend the time with The Illusionist during its first week on DVD. It was so good that, after viewing it on the way home from a business trip, I watched a second showing at home with my wife.<br /><br />My wife liked the movie as much as I did, and that's saying a lot based on her usual "where do you find these movies" comment after watching one of my DVD picks.<br /><br />The Illusionist is part Romeo and Juliet period drama based in turn of the century (no not the last one, the one before) Vienna.  It's part psychological drama...a kind of whodunit with a clever, but somewhat predictable twist. And the Illusionist is part magic show.<br /><br />A lot of the tricks in The Illusionist are movie magic...in fact most are movie magic and could only be done as so. Don't expect to go into this movie and be truly amazed by wizardry. But the tricks are a very fun part of the movie, and I believe the intention was to deliberately raise the question of how tales of necromancy could have been inspired. The answer? Mass hypnotism (purely my own speculation of the movie's intent).<br /><br />My recommendation is to see for yourself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hotels are naturally creepy places, don't you think?"></head><body><p>When it comes to horror movies, I'm skeptical.  Especially when they're based on the works of authors I admire.  When it comes to horror writing, Stephen King is above par--he is the guy you compare all others to.  There have been some wonderful adaptations of his novels; there have been some horrendous adaptations as well.  Fortunately for all concerned, "1408" fits snugly into the former category.<br /><br />Mike Enslin is a non-believer.  No ghosts, no goolies, not even a god.  He's searching, though; he looks everywhere for evidence of the paranormal, but has yet to see a glimpse.  Then he gets word of the Dolphin.  And room 1408.  He's warned to stay away.  The manager bribes him with expensive liquor.  But Mike doesn't listen.  And once he enters 1408, he has one hour to live.<br /><br />This movie creeped me out.  I say that so bluntly because movies rarely creep me out.  "The Exorcist" does it.  "Jaws" does it.  A couple others, perhaps, but not many.  Of course you have your genuine shock moments--turn around and a guy slashes with a knife, some creep-o pops out of a ventilation shaft.  But true horror is atmospheric; and what's more atmospheric than a dingy, supposedly haunted hotel room?<br /><br />If nothing else, "1408" shows that John Cusack has what it takes to carry a movie by himself.  Don't get me wrong--the acting is great.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance is top-notch; his scene with Cusack in the office is tremendously entertaining.  But Cusack gets the majority of the screen time, mostly by himself.  His dry wit comes in handy to counter-balance the stark horror of the movie.  Not saying "1408" is a horror comedy; just saying, you'll probably get a laugh or two before you wet yourself in terror.  That should make up for any discomfort, I think.</p></body></html>

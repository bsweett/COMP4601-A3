A beautifully written and directed story with a strong cast. This is an engrossing film that will keep you glued to the screen from start to finish. I went into this film not knowing anything about it, I was shocked that it turned out to be a much different film than I first assumed it would be. Eastwood proves he can do it all this beautiful and poignant film. No wonder this won best picture! The DVD has a great transfer, many extras and is a worthy purchase.</p></body></html>

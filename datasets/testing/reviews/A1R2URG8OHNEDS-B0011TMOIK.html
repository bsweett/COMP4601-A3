<meta name="summary" content="This Movie is Way Better Then the First!"></head><body><p>Since I didn't really care for the first movie of this seris to much I was expecting much from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I saw it because I being a fan of the books had to know what they did to it. The movie was longer then the first but much much better. There was a little more comendy which lightened it and it was much much darker. The director warned parents that it was going to be darker before the release and the darker subject made it more entertaining. The only dull moment in the movie was when the main characters found themselves in the Dark Forest with giant spiders. <p>Critic's hailed this movie not as good as the first but good so I was a little hesitant at that. But the actors being older and probally a little bit more like the character having pratice from the first one probally also made it enjoyable. <p>The movie is about Harry Potter(Danelle Radcliff) who recently found out that he was a wizard. He attended a school that teaches magic called Hogwarts and during the summer holidays he lives with two Muggles(non-magic people)called Veron and Petunia who are also his aunt and auncle. There son Dudley is always picking on Harry. When Veron has two people over to the house to set a deal it could be the biggest deal of his career. He tells Harry to stay in his room and not make a peep but that is when he is visited by Dobby the house elf. Dobby warns him not to go back to school because terrible things would happen. Harry says no and Dobby goes downstairs to the family and the guests and dumps a cake Petunia made right onto the guest's head. Venon outs bars on Harry's roof and keeps him inside his room. One night Harry is visited by his friend Ron and his two brother Fred and George who have come to pick him up in a flying car. Harry escapes and before he knows it is back at school a month later. Everything is normal at first. He goes to his classes and visits his friends. He also gets a new teacher. Gilaroy Lockhart who is a pompus writer to is always boasting about his experence with creatures like hags,vampires,werewolf,etc. Everything is fine untill written on the wall of on of the halls are the words THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPEN. ENIEMIS OF THE HEIR BEWARE! Now everybody is wondering what is going on and why some students are being petrified. <p>The best part about the movie is the humor that is brought to the screen by Lockharts's character. In the end Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fun film that is much better then the first one in everyway.<p>Also my condolences to Richard Harris who passed away two weeks before the release of the movie. Harris's last roles were Harry Potter and the Sorercer's Stone and The Count of Monte Cristo. Both in which he did excellant in. <p>ENJOY!</p></body></html>

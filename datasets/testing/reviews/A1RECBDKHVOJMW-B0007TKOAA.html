<meta name="summary" content="Both a quirky comedy and a moving drama- Superb Performances"></head><body><p>"Sideways" is at once a quirky comedy, and a moving, sometimes painful, drama about two men approaching middle-age, struggling with their identity and uncertain futures. Director Alexander Payne adapted the screenplay with his longtime writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book "Sideways" by Rex Pickett.  They created a well crafted plot, and complex, flawed characters. And the actors provide superb performances.<br /><br />Miles Raymond, (played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti), a somewhat nerdy, middle school English teacher and would-be novelist, has been unhappily divorced for two years, and is lonely, perpetually depressed and disappointed by his own failures and missed opportunities. He anxiously awaits a publisher's decision about the fate of his book, entitled "The Day After Yesterday," while he prepares for a much needed get-away trip with friend Jack Lopate. Jack, (Thomas Haden Church), and Miles were college roommates and have maintained a close, if neurotic friendship. Jack, a fading bit part TV actor and total commitment-phobe, is getting married in a week - for the first time. Before the wedding the two 40-something schlemiels take-off on a road trip through California's wine country. Miles wants to give his friend a worthy send-off, a wedding gift, before he finally takes the walk down the aisle. An amateur wine enthusiast and snob, Miles has planned a week of wine tasting, fine food, male bonding and golf. Jack has another agenda. He wants to sow as many wild oats as he can cram into seven days. And he wants the melancholy, unwilling Miles to have at least one one-night-stand. This is so not your father's bachelor party! They travel light but carry some heavy baggage with them.<br /><br />The two travel and taste wine throughout the gorgeous Santa Ynez region. The cinematography is wonderful and some of the rural landscapes resemble paintings. At a restaurant Miles frequents when in the area, they meet waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen), who Miles has long been attracted to. Jack is immediately on his buddy's back to "party" with Maya. His pushy insistence fills Miles with disgust and dismay. Then the men meet winery employee, Stephanie (Sandra Oh). Jack immediately hits on the young hottie and is successful!? However, he fails to mention his upcoming wedding plans to her. After 24 hours he does mention that he loves her and is thinking of moving to the valley, and, perhaps, buying a winery. Sadly he believes every word he says. Stephanie knows Maya, and the four get together for dinner. Later, while Jack and Steph are romancing, Miles and Maya talk about their passion for wine. When Maya asks Miles why he "has a thing for Pinot Noir," his response is sad and self-revealing. "It's a hard grape to grow. It's thin-skinned, temperamental, and ripens early. It is not like Cabernet, which can grow anywhere and thrive, even when it's neglected. In fact, it can only grow in these specific tucked-away corners of the world. Only the most patient and nurturing of growers can do it...to understand Pinot's potential and coax it into its fullest expression." Maya, a wise and sensitive woman, who is studying horticulture at the local university, understands. Her response, a wonderfully poetic monologue about what wine means to her, is mesmerizing. This gem of a scene is one of my favorites in the film.<br /><br />Eventually, after much character development, multiple adventures, plot twists, excellent dialogue, terrific humor, (there is a golf course scene which is hilarious!), many a bottle of great wine imbibed, and intense moments of self-revelation, the two guys, still friends, go home - back to reality. This is definitely a 5 Star film, nuanced, complex, with fabulous depth, seductive and not too fruity! A must see!<br />JANA</p></body></html>

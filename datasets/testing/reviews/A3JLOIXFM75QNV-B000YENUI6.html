It was superbly acted and I can't even begin to say how perfect Viggo Mortensen is as an actor. He embodied this role and it was perfection. I love how he is not afraid to get down and dirty, no matter what role he is in. He is a true actor. He pretty much is the reason to see this movie. Thats not a jab at the film. The actual movie is great to watch. It has an air of suspense surrounding it. You never know what is going to happen and to whom. And yes, the infamous Bathhouse scene is as awesome as everyone says it is, if you're not squeemish...</p></body></html>

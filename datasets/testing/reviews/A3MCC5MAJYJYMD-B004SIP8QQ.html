<meta name="summary" content="A look into Quentin Tarentino's thoughts."></head><body><p>'I'm the great Quentin Tarentino, director of such classics as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown.  Let me make two films that directly rip off the music and ideas from westerns and kung-fu movies and call them homages to those movies.  Since I haven't made a film in a while (on purpose), my die-hard fans who who blindly worship me will flock to theatres to see it.  Many people who don't realize I'm stealing ideas from other great filmmakers will think I'm coming up with these ideas on my own.<br />Look at me, I'm Quentin Tarentino, I can make movies that tells a story out of chronological order and from different viewpoints!!  What a genius I am!!  But secretly, I am a desperate con artist who finds new ways to get inside people's pocketbooks.  I've pretty much fooled almost everyone into thinking I'm a great filmamker.  Look, I'm Quentin Tarentino, I can make movie where people curse a lot and use the n-word.  That will look hip and cool to the clueless young people who worship me and my movies.'</p></body></html>

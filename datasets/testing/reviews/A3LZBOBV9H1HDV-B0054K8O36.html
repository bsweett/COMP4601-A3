This is how the story goes: When Captain Jack Sparrow crosses paths with the enigmatic Angelica, he's not sure if it's love -- or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the "Queen Anne's Revenge," the ship of the legendary pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know whom to fear more: Blackbeard or Angelica, with whom he shares a mysterious past.<br /><br />The cast led by Johnny Depp (returning in his Oscar-nominated performance as Captain Jack Sparrow), Penelope Cruz (as Angelica), Ian McShane (as Blackbeard) & Geoffrey Rush (also back as Barbossa) is great. The directing by Rob Marshall is great. The screen story (based on suggestion of the novel "On Stranger Tides" by Tim Powers) & screenplay by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio (both of them also executive produced) is great.<br /><br />The music by Hans Zimmer is great. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is great. The film editing by David Brenner & Wyatt Smith is great. The casting by Lucy Bevan is great. The production design by John Myhre is great. The art direction by Drew Boughton, John Chichester, Robert Cowper, Zack Grobler & Tomas Voth is great. The set decoration by Gordon Sim is great. The costume design by Penny Rose is great. The special and visual effects are great.<br /><br />This is a great summer movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, your heart racing and your mind guessing, at the same time. This is just as great as the first three "Pirates Of The Caribbean" movies. This is one of the best movies of the summer season, so far.</p></body></html>

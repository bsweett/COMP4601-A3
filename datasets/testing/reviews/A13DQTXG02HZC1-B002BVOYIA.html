To put it in a nutshell, Hotel Rwanda is akin to Oskar Schlinder saving the Jews in Schlinder's List.  Here, we would get to see how Rwanda is abandoned by major powers such as French, Belgium, and even America.  Unlike Iraq, Kuwait which have oil that America needs, Rwanda has nothing that those major power craves for.  Even when genocide begins, personnel for the White House is still debating if "genocide" is a just definition of what happened to Rwanda.  One million corpses is quite a body count, isn't it?  Even when Paul (Don Cheadle), House Manager for Mille Colline could leave Rwanda, he morally chooses to stay back to ensure that those under his protection would leave safely.  Established supporting cast such as Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Sophie Okonedo.  A movie to watch, lest we forget of human's propensity to commit evil towards one another.</p></body></html>

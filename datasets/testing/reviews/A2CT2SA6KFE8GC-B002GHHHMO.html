<meta name="summary" content="Spider Woman"></head><body><p>Now, without a doubt, The Exorcist is one of the greatest horror films ever made.  This film showed that horror films could actually be &quot;good&quot; oscar-worthy, and epic.  I love schlock and B films, but Exorcist gave horror a good(or bad depending on the person you ask)name.  I find this to be one of the finest the genre has to offer, but I'm not so sure about the new version.  I think I'm in the same category of hardcore Star Wars fans who didn't care much for the special editions.  If you ask me, it's pretty ballsy to mess with a classic, coz you really run the risk of upsetting alot of people.  I didn't think it was too bad really.  In fact, most of it I could deal with okay, but there was one thing I just couldn't:  The dreaded &quot;Spider walk.&quot;  I think that really ruined it.  Not only was it totally out of place at that point in the movie, but it looked so corny.  Having Reagan come out of her room and attack was premature.  Why didn't she do it again, or any ol' time she pleased?  Why did she do it the first time?  How did they get her back to her room?  Did she voluntarily go back to her room?  Since we're dealing with an old film that we can't reshoot, there is no footage in the original film to explain that scene.  Why was it never talked about again?  Don't you think Ellen Burstyn would have brought up this rather bizarre episode to the doctors or the priest?  Well, like I said, I could deal with the extra dialogue, spooky phantom flashes and the hint of CGI, but that spider walk has just got to go.</p></body></html>

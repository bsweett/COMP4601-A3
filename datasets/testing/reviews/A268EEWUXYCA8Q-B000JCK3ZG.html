Some, who know only a little or nothing at all of the X-men mythos, will enjoy it.  Some, who have read or seen all of the comics, will hate it.  And some will be like me, stuck in the middle.<br /><br />As a movie, X-men 3 is a pretty good way to end the *movie* series.  It ties up a lot of plot-lines, has some good twists, great Fx and a pretty decent story about love and mutants.  Its exciting to watch, visually stunning in parts and actually and surprisingly keeps the style and tone of the first two admirably well.<br /><br />On the other hand, as a story set in a mythos that is dozens upon dozens of years in the making, X-Men 3 falls flat on its face.  I  loved the first two, even though the mythos was messed around a bit, because it was a movie and you have to make some concessions.  Bryan Singer did an admirable job trying to tie together years upon years of story and create something that is true to the source and entertaining to those who have no idea who Wolverine is, as an example.  Unfortunately, X3 throws the mythos out of the window and simply does things it shouldn't do.  I can't talk about most of these things because I don't believe in spoilers.<br /><br />I will say, Rogue was totally under-used and spent most of the movie standing in line.  Storm was finally used in a decent way.  The major deaths in the film were insipid (as was the after-the-credits "revelation" that really ruined anything the movie had going for it).  Bret Rattner apparently has seen the Juggernaut video and there is a scene that is a nice and hillarious homage to that video.  But unfortunately, practically everything the first two films stood for was thrown out of the window.<br /><br />So, I'm torn.  On one hand, the movie was pretty decent as a *movie*.  Unfortunately, a portion of my soul died when I saw it last night and shook my head at the way Ratner handled the story.  If you know nothing about the X-men mythos, enjoy.  If you have read every single comic book, be prepared for a let down.  If you're like me, go in with an open mind, knowing that it won't be exactly as it should and maybe you won't be disappointed.  Maybe.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ellen Page makes this movie!"></head><body><p>I thought this movie was just a great piece of light-hearted cinema.  Although the slang is a little dense (and frankly some of it is just weird, but maybe that is because I am 25 years old and already out of the loop), Ellen Page totally entranced me.  She was compelling and believable as the quirky, yet still naive girl in over her head.<br /><br />My favorite part of the film is the beginning: Rainn Wilson is just great in that little role.  The line, "it started with a chair" was so intriguing.  And her sitting in the living room set outside Bleeker's house with the pipe in her mouth was priceless!<br /><br />Give it a shot and enjoy yourself.</p></body></html>

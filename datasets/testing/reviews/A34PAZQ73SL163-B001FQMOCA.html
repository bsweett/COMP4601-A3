With all the hype, I figured it would be either great or terrible, but I was wrong. Walk the Line is above average, but that is principally due to the excellence of its actors. Phoenix and Witherspoon are far more inspired than one can imagine. They pay exquisite homage to these deceased legends. It makes you want to go back and watch every documentary ever made just so you can experience the real thing. Phoenix had the great man's every idiosyncrasy down, and the way he hunches his shoulders up as he struts around during live performances was almost eerie. Outside of individual performances, the film itself was rather erratic. One should understand in advance though that this is not the life and times of Johnny Cash. It is his life in the context of his relationship with June Carter which makes it far less interesting than it otherwise would be. Really, the problem with it is that the movie skirts the line between bio and chick flick with the latter being far too pronounced. It is not great cinema but its craftsmanship and devotion to detail place it on a plane far above the rest which Hollywood usually offers.</p></body></html>

There is no real chance anyone has of escaping its effects as best we try sometimes. For as simple an act as falling in love may seem, falling out of love or moving on after lover lost is never quite as easy a thing to actually carry out. It is never a gracious thing to go through life believing what our mothers had always told us, that there would be someone out there for every one of us, especially when you have nothing with you now to show for it. As hard as we might try, it is practically impossible when we are alone to prevent our minds from racing with the thoughts of "what if I never find that special someone". There is always tomorrow, you tell yourself day in and day out as the weeks and months slip slowly by like tiny grains of sand through a timer, wondering within your subconscious how long you can keep this act up of fooling yourself with such nonsense. Depression inevitably sinks in as life pitches you the perfect no-hitter in the field of relationships, knocking you about as if you were the universe's personal whore. All around you see couples holding each other's hands and clinging tight to their loved ones while you travel the seemingly desolate sidewalks alone and downtrodden. If love is as chaotic as everyone makes it out to be, why is it that we find ourselves returning to it time and again despite the afflictive lessons of the past? Love is simply a natural occurrence, instinctive really, and there is nothing you or anyone else can do to control those feelings you have for someone close and dear to you, even if they may not know it just yet. Love, when lost or unrequited, can truly be dispiriting, but once you are able to get back on that horse it can be the most completely fulfilling experience of your life and no one should prevent themselves from embracing it head on.<br /><br />The story is a mingled interweaving of several individual storylines, all of which involve the enchanting, if not often perplexing, subject of love written by Richard Curtis, the man behind such romantic comedies as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Bridget Jones's Diary. With just five weeks left until Christmas, London, England is abuzz with men and women sorting out their love lives, or lack of them. The film begins with David, the recently elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who, not even seconds into the door of his new home, has fallen deeply in love with his catering manager Natalie, recently dumped by her ex-boyfriend who complained of her being "too fat". David's younger sister Karen attempts to juggle a crippling relationship with her husband, Harry, the operator of a local magazine, who has become quite friendly with his flirtatious secretary Mia, and helping her friend Daniel cope with the recent passing of his wife. While attempting to move on with his life, Daniel must also help navigate his eleven year old son through a situation of his own, having fallen in love with an American girl who happens to be the most popular girl at school. Karen is also friends with Jamie Bennett, a novelist who has temporarily relocated to France to nurse his broken heart after discovering his girlfriend cheating on him with his much younger and more attractive brother, only to be captivated by Aurelia, the Portuguese housekeeper of his country villa. Harry's best editor Sarah is absolute smitten by Karl, a fellow magazine editor, and has been ever since she started working at the magazine over a year ago but has not had the courage to tell him how she has felt and complications with her brother, who is currently in the asylum, has not made her personal life any easier. Juliet has just married Peter not realizing that his best friend Mark, the photographer, has been infatuated with her ever since they first met, though he has never spoken a word of this to anyone, let alone herself. Colin Frissell, a lascivious waiter at Peter and Juliet's wedding reception, unable to connect with British women decides to travel to the states, specifically Wisconsin, to score with a bunch of American girls relying solely on his "British charm". And burnt-out former British rock-icon Billy Mack, desperate for a comeback to the top of the charts after overcoming a long standing heroin addiction, acts as the main connection for all these individual love-lines.<br /><br />The story for Love Actually is almost as complicated a matter, ironically, as the concept of love itself. In order to find all the connections between the characters and understand the unfolding of events within the framework of the picture one must truly pay attention throughout the interwoven storylines but it is not as complicated a concept as it would seem. We connect with the characters and their actions on screen almost instantaneously because we, as individuals, see ourselves and our own lovelorn, often foolish, actions paraded in front of us on screen. Having experienced at least one, if not more, of the complex love stories in our own lives, we are at long last able to see our own actions for ourselves and are able to gain a fresh perspective and a far better understanding of those events, thus putting our minds, and perhaps even our souls, at ease for it.<br /><br />Colin Firth works splendidly as Jamie Bennett, a man so desperate to escape the pangs of lost love that he flees the country to concentrate on his novel only to fall in love once again with a charming woman who doesn't speak a word of English. This just goes to show that love is both blind and strong and it can not be deterred by the mere language barriers that have separated us in so many other functions of human interaction throughout the world. It would have been more appropriate for the filmmakers to have taken Liam Neeson's Daniel a little more serious - the events at the funeral were not offensive given the context but they did seem a tad bit out place considering it was a funeral after all - being how he lost his wife but this is a comedy and it was expected for them not to dwell too longingly on the rather serious subject matter. The deteriorating relationship between Karen and Harry, played eloquently by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman respectfully, on other hand, was handled as it should have been allowing the audience to contemplate in their head the events, not always in consecutive order, that can lead to love loss in a relationship to love found in another and how everyone in that triangle is affected by it. The most charming scene in the entire film has to be when Mark, played with such effort by Andrew Lincoln, visits Juliet on Christmas Eve and tells her, silently via the use of cue-cards (clever) and carol music, how he has always felt about her but never bucked up the courage to tell her until now. Often, when we lose someone close to our heart to another man or woman, quite possibly forever, we instinctively want to shut out those feelings we once had for that person and attempt to move on with our lives as best we can but never seems to work out. We, as human beings, need closure with any close relationship we have in our lives, whether it involves family, friends, or loves, and we can never fully move on until we let our feelings be known to that person. It is better for us to act upon those feelings then to hold them in, worrying ourselves to death with the thought of "had she/he but known", even if nothing is to come about as a result of this forthrightness, as this particular scenes demonstrates. Then and only then can we be one within our mind once again, telling ourselves "enough" and having the ability now to move on fully with our life. Billy Bob Thornton makes a cheap cameo in the role of the President of the United States. Though his slick southern persona and entirely unlikable womanizing style, eerily renascent of William Jefferson Clinton, are worth a few laughs, he contributes practically nothing to the storyline and could have easily been downplayed or excluded from the film altogether. Originally Rowan Atkinson's character, Rufus, the jewelry department salesman, was supposed to be an angel and would have disappeared after passing Daniel in the airport near the end of the film, which would have done a better job in clearing up his involvement in both Harry's and Daniel's son's relationships but as it stands it works out fine.<br /><br />Overall, critics may complain about Love Actually's uniquely over-the-top nature and its ability to be so overtly clich&eacute;d even for its own good but, in actuality, often love is like that sometimes - it is never as spontaneous or original as we would want it to be but it retains its charm and effective none the less, which goes hand-in-hand with this film and enduring message. Despite creating a distinctively potent and dazzling directorial debut, there are several aspects to the film that failed to pan out properly for Richard Curtis. For example, though come-back rocker Billy Mack does tie all the loose coalition of storylines together and ultimately lends help to the charming, if not overtly clich&eacute;d, ending involving Daniel's son and the love of his life at the airport, his own storyline on the other hand feels flat and uninteresting. Either his character should have been expanded or simply pushed more into the background as a mere side character instead of what is given to us here. John and Judy, the couple that meets on the set for a stimulated love scene for a motion picture, are two other supporting characters that could have been left out of the film entirely as they contribute nothing to the story at all. It is fantastic to see that Curtis wants to demonstrate love lost and found in a variety of situations but there is a point when so much becomes too much and you eventually have to cut something loose to balance the feature out again, something Curtis fails to do here. But these are comparatively minor slip-ups, as unnecessary and inconvenient to the overall storyline as they may be, and hardly leave a lasting affect on the film's clear-cut purpose and contemplative message that love is truly all we need in this world to be happy. True, the sole intention of this film was that of romantic comedy but it does not hurt to pay closer attention to the events that unfold within this feature and perhaps gain a clear understanding of a situation in our own complicated love life, one we may not have obtained else where. Love actually is all around us - all we have to do is open our eyes and see it for ourselves.</p></body></html>

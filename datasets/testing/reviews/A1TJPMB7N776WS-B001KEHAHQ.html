<meta name="summary" content="Clouseau to the rescue!"></head><body><p>This version of "The Pink Panther" has had a rough journey to the theaters as the powers-that-be at MGM/Sony felt that the original version of it was too racy and that Clouseau (a hilarious Steve Martin) was too much of a letch.<br />After re-shoots, 5 million dollars and delays in the release date from last summer, "The Pink Panther" has finally opened and, though the story is a little creaky it is very, very funny, sometimes even hilarious and Martin's Clouseau is perfect: more homey, less weird than Peter Sellers...but definitely a successful interpretation.<br />The story involves the Pink Panther diamond, a pop singer (bombshell Beyonce' Knowles), a soccer manager's murder (Jason Stratham) and around once again to use and abuse Clouseau, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (a muted Kevin Kline).<br />Some of the racy double entendres were thankfully left intact and Clouseau's relationship with his assistant Nicole (a funny, sexy Emily Mortimer) is warm and witty....something that Sellers's Clouseau could never quite attain.<br />"The Pink Panther" 2006 is a barrel of laughs and yet its comedy is thankfully rooted in the things that make us human: it's a major change from the previous incarnation but a welcome one and an artistic success nonetheless.</p></body></html>

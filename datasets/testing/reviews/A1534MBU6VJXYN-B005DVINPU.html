The packaging was shoddy, there were no bonus features, and sound and picture quality was average at best.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2005, With the success of Christopher Nolan's reboot "Batman Begins", interest in the old series has been revived. Picking up on this, Warner Brothers has finally released the original 1989 blockbuster (as well as its three sequels, which vary in quality) on special edition dvd, complete with a second disc filled with bonus features.<br /><br />Most reviewers have already gone over the plot and other aspects of the film (such as Jack Nicholson's amazing performance as The Joker), so I'm going to jump straight into the second disc. I can only say one word...WOW! There is a ton of stuff loaded on this dvd. The first disc features an entertaining commentary track by Burton himself. It is insightful, informative and at times hilarious, but never annoying like some reviewers say it is. But the second disc is where all the goodies lie. There are featurettes going over every aspect of the Dark Knight's journey from the pages of DC Comics to cinemas across the world. The interviews are all very enjoyable. I was really glad that Jack Nicholson participated, since he isn't really a big fan of interviews. His comments are a joy to watch. He to this day loves to have been a part the film, and it shows. He even wears a purple shirt and a Batman pin to prove it.<br /><br />I can go on and on and on about how awesome this dvd, but I'm just gonna sya that this is one dvd that belongs in your collection (alogn with the other four Batman films, which are all available on two disc special edition dvds as of October 18th, 2005). It is one you will want to reach for over and over again.</p></body></html>

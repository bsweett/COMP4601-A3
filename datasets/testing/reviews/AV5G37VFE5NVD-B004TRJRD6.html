Adapted by William Peter Blatty from his own novel, this legendary horror flick follows the difficulties of a mother (Ellen Burstyn) whose 12-year-old girl (Linda Blair, in her biggest performance) becomes possessed by the devil, and how the mother discovers that the only way to save her daughter is an exorcism.  There is frightening directing by William Friedkin (THE FRENCH CONNECTION), a very short by haunting score by Jack Nitzsche, and great performances by Burstyn, Blair, Jason Miller, Lee J. Cobb and Max von Sydow.  To add to that, there's horrifyingly realistic special effects (by Marcel Vercoutere) and eerie cinematography (by Owen Roizman).  Now we also have &quot;The Version You've Never Seen&quot; - which, hopefully you have seen, because it includes ten minutes of new, terrifying footage.  Once you've seen, the film's hundreds of ghastly images will never leave your mind.  Simply put, THE EXORCIST will live on to horrify us for generations to come.</p></body></html>

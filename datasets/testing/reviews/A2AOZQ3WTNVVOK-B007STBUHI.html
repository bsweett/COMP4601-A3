<meta name="summary" content="Great Monster Movie (Region 2 DVD)"></head><body><p>In 1975 "Jaws" was a phenomenon. The one theater in Colorado Springs that was playing "Jaws" had lines for every showing for weeks and the movie was in the theater for months.<br /><br />The opening moments of this movie became the standard for hosts of low-budget gore-fests to follow, completely missing the style and drama of this movie. Our introductory characters are doing what all young adults do, partying and having fun, never imagining the menace lurking...just...below...the water. The music begins, with the characteristic sequence used by millions to enhance completely unrelated water-cooler conversations; menacing, sending chills up your spine, it's that SHARK MUSIC! Dozens of cheap horror movies have tried without success to copy the opening, yearning to set the stage for the supposed horror to come.<br /><br />In its own way, this movie combines the drama of "The Old Man and the Sea," with far more action, and the thrill of a well-done monster movie. This movie, while involving a host of protagonists, is ultimately a battle between Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and a great white shark, which represents not only itself, but all Brody's personal demons.<br /><br />It is amazing that a mechanical shark could generate such terror. Watching how the movie was made, it's relatively easy to see that the shark was mechanical. Stephen Spielberg used clever camera work in combination with the intensity of each shark appearance to keep your focus on the story and being held in suspense, completely ignoring whatever flaws there may have been in his excellent mechanical monster. Furthermore, the shark inspires fear not by crude use of blood and entrails being swallowed or floating in the water, but by frothy water and its sudden, yet anticipated, appearances, with a bit of red-coloring to bring out your worst fears.<br /><br />What enhances the terror of the shark attacks is that they occur at a public beach where millions journey each year. Shark experts Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) provide all sorts of true information regarding sharks to give you the picture that they are mindless killing machines (though that is an extreme exaggeration). The audience knows what is coming and yet the innocents on the beach insist on throwing themselves into harm's way.<br /><br />The final sequence in the movie is excellent and provides an inexorable buildup to the climax, fast yet slow. This sequence also provides what is probably the goriest portion of the movie. In the end, as in many dramas, the battle is between Chief Brody and the antagonist, the shark. Can Chief Brody conquer his fears? How will he do it? The suspense is just killing me! Here comes the SHARK!!! LOOK OUT!!!<br /><br />This movie is still suspenseful and well worth watching more than 30 years after its release. One of the best monster movies ever, and just enough basis in reality to be considered a drama as well. Five stars for a movie you can watch over and over again.</p></body></html>

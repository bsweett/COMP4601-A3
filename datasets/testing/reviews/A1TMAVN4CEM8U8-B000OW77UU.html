<meta name="summary" content="In Pursuit of Boredom"></head><body><p>Pursuit of Happiness  (DVD)<br /><br />Pursuit of Happiness starring Will Smith and Will Smith's real life son is so boring that I couldn't finish watching it and I don't understand all the hype.  Sure Will Smith's son is cute, the best line in the movie, at least the fraction that I watched was "  How do you know about Bonanza?  Do you watch it after your nap?  "No, after Love boat" I do understand that it is based on a true life story, but, boring.<br /><br />Not recommended for adults.  Maybe children would enjoy it.<br /><br />Gunner  August  2,007</p></body></html>

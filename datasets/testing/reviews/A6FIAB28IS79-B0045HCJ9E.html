<meta name="summary" content="Americanization of Alfred and Archie"></head><body><p>Less resonant than &quot;Vertigo,&quot; more complex and layered than &quot;Rear Window,&quot; &quot;North by Northwest&quot; has something for everyone.  The title is from &quot;Hamlet,&quot; especially appropriate because of the film's plot movement from NYC to South Dakato and because of the protagonist.  Grant plays a character running from a protective mother, encountering a threatening version of Ophelia, and all the while putting on various &quot;antic dispositions&quot; while seeking to claim his own national identity and personal autonomy.  Hitchcock has not only taken his British actor but his own British classic, &quot;The 39 Steps,&quot; and transformed them into cinematic icons as recognizably American as Mount Rushmore.  The protagonist's flight starts from the United Nations and threatens to take on an international theme until the thrilling and delightful climactic action sequence.  The dispossessed hero on the run, Archie Leach, instantaneously becomes the American object of desire--Cary Grant--and Hitchcock becomes the consummate exploiter of American moviegoers' fears, dreams, desires in a segue that collapses fear and desire, death and sex into a closing moment as characteristically American as any conclusion in film.  Besides this unforgettable edit, the film contains one of Hitchcock's 3 most celebrated editing sequences: the tennis match from &quot;Strangers on a Train,&quot; the shower scene from &quot;Psycho,&quot; and in &quot;North by Northwest&quot; the low-flying plane that threatens to harvest Gary Grant.</p></body></html>

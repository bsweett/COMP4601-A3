Retired CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) hopes to restore his relationship with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and reluctantly agrees to let her travel to France with a friend. When Kim and her friend are kidnapped by slave runners, Bryan must resort to his special skills to scour the French underworld before she disappears forever. Though not a groundbreaking movie, "Taken" is an amusing action-packed thriller from director Pierre Morel (The Transporter) and producer Luc Besson (The Fifth Element). It was released in France in February of 2008 but was released in the United States in January of 2009. With $145 million in the North American box-office, it was one of the first successful films of 2009. The story is straight forward with a few twists and character clich&eacute;s. Neeson's performance further drives the drama and the action sequences are a total blast.<br /><br />Despite a few early lackluster releases, 20th Century Fox has certainly deliver some fine looking Blu-Ray titles and "Taken" 2-disc Extended Cut is no exception. Both the 91-minute theatrical cut and the 93-minute unrated cut are presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. With a splendid level of detail and rich lifelike colors, the picture quality is indeed impressive. Its DTS-HD audio offers top quality clarity, dynamic surround effects and some good bass. Its special features include two audio commentary tracks by the film's director and crew, the "Black Ops Field Manual" option that allows viewers to follow the progress of the story, footage of the film's premier and two behind-the-scenes featurettes (Le Making of & Inside Action: Side By Side Comparisons). Overall, "Taken" 2-disc Extended Cut scores a "B+".</p></body></html>

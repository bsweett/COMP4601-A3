<meta name="summary" content="Pollack genius polishes great suspense thriller 4.5 stars"></head><body><p>I have never subscribed to the movie maxim that a great director makes for a great movie, but here it was never more true. Sydney Pollacks political thriller set inside the United Nations is a masterful pot boiler full of suspense, credible plot lines and directed with a masterful even handedness that is never overbearing. Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broom, a multi lingual translator working in the UN in New York, who overhears a plot to assassinate the dictatorial leader of Matobo (a war torn and divided African State). She is summarily placed under the protection of the Secret Service in the form of Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), an action that actually heightnes the nightmare into which she has become immersed, and the intrigue and suspense begins to build in even layers. Both Kidman and Penns characters are intertwined as they each deal with their own recent personal losses, but Pollack deliberatley steers away from a formula pattern of attraction, instead delving deep into character development and a great storyline. Is Kidman a target? a victim? or even a suspect? we find ourselves asking as the story unfolds. The two begin to play a gripping dance of evasion and revelation that keeps them both guessing as they head to stop a potential international crisis. There are some dramatic sequences, and thought provoking side comment along the way, giving the whole picture a complete and professional feel seldom seen in other films of the genre. The movie itself was groundbreaking as it is actually filmed  inside the UN (the first time this has ever been done), but this is just an interesting caveat to a great movie. Pollack himself pops up for a small but believable cameo (as he seems to do in most of his movies) but he takes a back seat to some top class acting, chiefly from Kidman and Penn in the lead roles. The early 2005 release will probably preclude an Oscar nod for next year, but this is right up there, and represents some of Pollacks best work, of the calibre of Three Days of the Condor, and The Firm to name just two. One or two very minor inconsistencies and flaws I felt personally, kept me from giving this 5 stars, but make no mistake, this is an excellent movie from all angles. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

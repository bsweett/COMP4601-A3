Though it was protested by religious groups it shows that Kevin Smith has obviously studied and thought about the subject quite a bit, though his view is admittedly askew. I was expecting that it would be a terrible movie, but Smith had a lot of profound thoughts and waited until he was mature enough as a film maker to tackle them. There was only a few places where the acting was as bad as in his first film, 'Clerks,' and by that I mean places where you are acutely aware that the actors are reading a script, one weighted down with a lot of philosophy and theology, and they falter under their burden. Ben Affleck, as rogue angel Bartleby, carries a lot of the excess theological baggage, so I suppose that it isn't really fair to single him out. Salma Hayek, as the muse Serendipity, was nominated for a Razzie award for worst acting--but she didn't win it!<br /><br />In 'Dogma' we have the usual Kevin Smith obsessions: New Jersey, Quick Marts, Hockey, John Hughes film references--and there is the usual cast of Jason Mewes and himself as Jay and Silent Bob, along with frequent flyers Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Jason Lee, augmented with Chris Rock as the 13th Apostle Rufus, Linda Fiorentino as Bethany Sloane, Alanis Morissette, Bud Cort, Salma Hayek, Janeane Garofalo, and Alan Rickman.<br /><br />If you have ever wondered how many angels could dance on the head of a pin, and wanted to see a movie that ponders such topics--along with pot, potty, and other sorts of tasteless jokes--then 'Dogma' is the movie for you! Not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be.<br /><br />-----<br />Nun: You don't believe in God because of Alice in Wonderland?<br />Loki: No, "Through the Looking Glass". That poem, "The Walrus and the Carpenter" that's an indictment of organized religion. The walrus, with his girth and his good nature, he obviously represents either Buddha, or... or with his tusk, the Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha. That takes care of your Eastern religions. Now the carpenter, which is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was raised a carpenter's son, he represents the Western religions. Now in the poem, what do they do... what do they do? They... They dupe all these oysters into following them and then proceed to shuck and devour the helpless creatures en masse. I don't know what that says to you, but to me it says that following these faiths based on mythological figures ensure the destruction of one's inner-being. Organized religion destroys who we are by inhibiting our actions... by inhibiting our decisions, out of... out of fear of some... some intangible parent figure who... who shakes a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says...<br />==================<br /><br />OTHER NOTABLE FILM ROLES FROM 'DOGMA' CAST MEMBERS<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067BBLY">De-Lovely</a> (2004) ....

Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water is a place where myth and reality intertwine in a spellbinding story of a sea nymph who holds the future of the world in her eyes. With one look, she will become a muse to a struggling writer played by M. Night Shyamalan himself, who is an amazing actor and I hope he will appear in more of his movies. He has a magical radiating presence that infuses the movie with light.<br /><br />This is a story of humor and heart and the unlikely hero brings a subtle beauty and kindness to this terror-laced fairytale. The soundtrack keeps you riveted and the wild darkness of the rabid scrunt/hyena is only equaled by the fright you experience as the sprinklers keep going off at odd times.<br /><br />The misty surroundings, wet grass and evening rain gives the story atmosphere and keeps you wondering about the creatures lurking in the darkness. If you are expecting dark horror with gratuitous gore, you will be disappointed. This is a much more finely crafted movie with elements so beautiful they are difficult to describe. The human drama intertwines with the sea nymph's purposeful intent and as the community works together to solve an overwhelming task, she becomes weaker as the humans must show their best qualities and emotional strength.<br /><br />If you love movies like Big Fish, the pool in this movie is also center stage. This is where the sea nymph lives in a room below the pool with cracking walls. While Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti - who is a natural at physical comedy) fixes garbage disposals and changes light bulbs for tenants, he tries to figure out the fairytale that is about to come true.<br /><br />For the most part, I found myself laughing at the start and then completely lost in the magic of the story right until the last second. Lady in the Water was everything I had wished it could be after I initially listened to the soundtrack.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></body></html>

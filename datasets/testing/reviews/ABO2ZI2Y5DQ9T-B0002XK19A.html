<meta name="summary" content="Better Than The First, and The Best of the Superhero Movies"></head><body><p>This is probably the best superhero movie perhaps this side of 'Superman,' and if you don't like this kind of film, you must see it.  Not because of its special effects; they are superb as expected, but that is not the point.  You should see it simply because it skillfully presents the credible characters with deep emotions, and the film is not afraid of stopping a while to show how a superhero can be a real human, and a villain can too.<br /><br />The carefully written script (by Alvin Sargent, 'Julia') picks up the story of the original after two years.  Peter Parker is still a struggling photographer while Mary Jane is about to have a commercial break as stage actress.  Peter is still in love with her, but because of the incessant crimes of the city, he again broke the promise he made with her.<br /><br />Then Peter is invited to a room of genius scientist Doctor Otto Octavius (by pefectly cast Alfred Molina).  Doc's new experiment, supported Peter's old friend Harry Osborn (James Franco, reprising the role), is going to be held in the city, and Peter is allowed to witness it, and its awful failure, which turns Doctor into a villain with robotic tentacles.<br /><br />Written on paper, the story looks as silly as any other recent films you name, but the results are just brilliant.  The story is always interesting, being unpredictable at times, with slight amount of humor and lots of first-rate special effects.  In the middle of the speedy action scenes, director Sam Raimi shows his sense of humor, which is both surprising and hilarious.  (My favorite: Spider-man using elevator.)  And see Doc in labo, making a havoc there, which is shot with his trademark camera work that made him famous in 'Evil Dead'.<br /><br />'Spider-Man 2' is probably better than the first one, in making more convincing characters and presenting well-balanced storytelling.  Of course its great CGIs are not to be missed, but more amazing thins is that these CGIs really support the main feature of the film -- the characters we truly care.  And that can be rarely found.</p></body></html>

The story is very sad and even though I was around in those times I was too young and preoccupied with my youth to understand what it was like then.<br /><br />The film gets a big boost from Penn, Franco and Brolin, but some characters portrayed seem cartoonish. The film starts out strong, sags in the middle and gives us the sad ending. It's a film worth watching, but I doubt I'll give it a second look. It is certainly a story worth telling.</p></body></html>

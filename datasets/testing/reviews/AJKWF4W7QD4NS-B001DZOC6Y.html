After crafting smashing flicks like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, it seemed as Shyamalan couldn't do wrong.  Then we had The Village and Lady in the Water; end of story.  Maybe that's why I looked so forward to The Happening, as it seemed as if Shyamalan may have re-discovered what made his films so good in the first place.  Heavily marketed as being his first R-rated film, The Happening is instead mammothly disappointing as a horror film or paranoid thriller, and for it's relatively brisk running time, just seems to meander along.  Mark Wahlberg stars as a science teacher in a failing marriage who, along with his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher (John Leguizamo) go on the run when a toxin hits the air, causing people to kill themselves.  While The Happening gets off to a great start with some wonderfully creepy and graphic moments, it loses its momentum as the story drags on.  It doesn't help that Wahlberg and Deschanel are miscast either, and in the end we just don't care about the characters at all.  Still though, Shyamalan manages to inject enough disturbing imagery into the film to be able to get under your skin, and suggests that maybe he's looking to get into an edgier kind of film making instead of the tried and true "PG-13 with a twist at the end" kind of deal.  All in all, The Happening isn't an entirely horrible film (and much better than Lady in the Water mind you), but it's still a disappointing endeavor from a once heralded director.  Still, it could just be a step in the right direction.</p></body></html>

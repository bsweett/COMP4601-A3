I cannot speak for the adaptation from the book but I found the film inspirational in that one understands the experiences from which the courage to face up to a totalitarian regime come from.<br /><br />The story begins some years in the not too distant future when England has been transformed into a Fascist state under the rule of a chancellor (played by John Hurt).  The United States is embroiled in a civil war (origin unknown).  The dictatorship (with overtones of Hitler) has a foot in Orwell's 1984 in describing a regime that has literally banned all freedoms but it struck me more that these are the hallmarks of all dictatorships: the cult of the leader, suppressing free speech, spying on their citizens.  The film centers on the mysterious character called "V," who is part Zorro and Phantom of the Opera (in that he is disfigured) wearing a mask of Guy Fawkes (famed for the Gunpowder Plot during the reign of James I); he is an avenger and a liberator.  The pivotal character Evey (Rachael Portman) has suffered under the dictatorship with her parents (who protested against the regime) dying in labor camps and her brother dying as a result of biological weapon released by the government to instill fear.  The key part of the story is Evey's transformation from a fearful person, who bows to the dictatorship, into a defiant freedom fighter.<br /><br />However, Evey is not the only person affected by "V."  After his initial act of defiance (blowing up the Old Bailey on Guy Fawkes' Day) all of the people are awakened into their own acts of defiance.  This is the focus of "V for Vendetta," that power is with the people to produce change.  This is true throughout history from the American Revolution to the Orange Revolution.  After seeing the film I read the reviews of some film critics who believe the film is a jab at the Bush Administration.  Lately, several films have been exploited for a political message that I think is simply not there.  Even the "March of the Penguins" became a political football when it was held up as an example of "family values!"  One can read into "V for Vendetta" what one wishes but I do not see how it can be labeled as having an anti-Bush agenda.  The point of the film is that we all have a responsibility to hold our governments accountable for what they do, not just a single figure who has the courage to stand up; we all have to be ready to make sacrifices.  For me, this is a story of the triumph of the human spirit.<br /><br />The casting is perfect on all levels.  Hugo Weaving rises to the challenge of acting behind a mask using his voice alone to bring depth to his character and Natalie Portman goes from a frightened young woman to being committed and fearless.  Stephen Rhea's Inspector Finch is an interesting everyman whose aim is to capture "V" but gradually understands the depths of the corrupt regime he is supporting, Stephen Fry has an excellent part as a television comedy show host who has much to hide and Tim Piggott-Smith is a superb villain.  Being a long-time fan of John Hurt it was enjoyable to see him again, especially since in the film of "1984" he was the victim of Big Brother.<br /><br />I was drawn into the film from the start and the 132 minutes passed faster than I wanted, and I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

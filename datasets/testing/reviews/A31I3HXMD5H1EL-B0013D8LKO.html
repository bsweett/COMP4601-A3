<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's Enigmatic Swansong"></head><body><p>Be warned, as you watch 'Eyes Wide Shut'; if you are expecting an erotic thriller, or a fast-paced suspense film, or a 'By-the-Numbers' formula picture, you will be disappointed! Stanley Kubrick always searched for  themes that would challenge viewers, and force them to see the world in a  different light. 'Eyes Wide Shut', his final film, certainly does that, and  is a film that will be enjoyed more with repeated viewings.<p>What is  reality? This film challenges us to make our own conclusions, as we see the  story of a  Yuppie couple unfold. Tom Cruise, as the husband, has a  successful career, but is shallow and superficial, coasting along on his  looks and social contacts. Nicole Kidman, his unemployed spouse, is a good  wife and mother, but bored, and compensates by drinking and flirting, and  fantasizing about a Naval officer she'd seen the previous summer. As she  acknowledges her erotic daydreams to Cruise, he reacts, first with  jealousy, then with a desire to find an outlet for the sexual frustration  he feels. Thus begins nighttime odysseys into a dreamlike world of  discovery; of a friend's unfulfilled desires, of a dual-personality hooker,  of a teenager being pimped by her father, of a cult which may only promote  orgies, or may have a far more sinister intent. <p>Nothing is spelled out,  or made obvious, and Kubrick throws in clues which will have you reaching  conclusions that you may find will change, when the film is viewed again!  'Eyes Wide Shut' demands your full attention, and rewards you with an  enigma! Is ANYTHING what it seems? The film's final line, delivered by  Kidman, is coarse, but totally in keeping with Cruise's journey, throughout  the film, and provides the director a wry closure to this most unusual  film!<p>While 'Eyes Wide Shut' will never be rated as highly as '2001',  'The Shining', 'A Clockwork Orange', or 'Dr. Strangelove', it is  provocative and mysterious, and deserves your attention!</p></body></html>

Being all CGI gave the film makers unlimited freedom as to what they could do unlike other superhero movies which use live actors. The animation in this movie is just beautiful and sometimes photorealistic. At times, the animated characters faces look real. The only problem I had with this movie was there was a certain lack of emotion needed to really make you care about the characters. But other than that, this movie is a feast for the eyes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Took me by surprise"></head><body><p>When I went to the theatre to see the film within the first five minutes I was convinced that I wasn't going to like it.  But Sideways sneaks up on you.  Miles, somehow when you're not looking, steals your heart.  Miles is a complex man whose grief, sorrow, and regret keeps the audience emotionally invested.  I found myself wanting to know more about wine and their histories, too.  Paul Giamatti was definitely robbed of an Oscar nomination, however, it was year of great male performances.  Who would you take out-?  Maybe 2004 should have had six nominees?  Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

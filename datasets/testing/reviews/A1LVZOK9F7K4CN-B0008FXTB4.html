Get Shorty was a great film; it was smart, quick, and funny.  Be Cool wants desperately to be like Get Shorty.  The problem with the novel Be Cool was that it was too similar to Get Shorty and the filmmakers have only made it more so.  The lines from the first film get echoed, not once, but over, and over, and over again.  They recycle all the jokes, and situations, and dialogue from the first movie.  Granted, there are a few new additions to the film: in the book, Linda Moon was in a rock band, but in the movie, she's more of a Beyonce Knowles rip-off.  Vince Vaughn works the hardest at his role as Linda Moon's manager, who thinks he's a pimp.  The Rock stars as the James Gandolfini character in this one.  Of course, the problem with going through all the motions of the first film is that Be Cool suffers by comparison: it seems long and boring.  It just makes you think, "What a great picture Get Shorty was."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A very entertaining movie!"></head><body><p>This was a very good, very entertaining movie.  With all the technology we have today we have no doubt lost the fascination with illusion that Eisenheim's audiences marveled over.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the ending was rushed a bit.  Too much activity was placed in the last minutes of the film to allow for a complete and satisfactory explanation of the main element of the story, mainly, the mutual love of Eduard and the Countess.</p></body></html>

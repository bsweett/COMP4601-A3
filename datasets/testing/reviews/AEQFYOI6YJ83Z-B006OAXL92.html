<meta name="summary" content="Simply a beautiful piece of cinema."></head><body><p>Martin Scorsese is primarily known for two things: making gritty, true-to-life movies (usually set in New York City) that chronicle violence and human chaos in all its nasty forms; and loving, utterly treasuring, the art of cinema.  HUGO belongs firmly in the latter category.  It's a movie about movies; moreover, it's a movie about cherishing movies, a summation of an entire art form from one of its most devoted admirers.<br /><br />There is a plot here, of course: young Orphan Hugo hides in the walls of a train station, working the clocks and carrying for a robotic figure his father found in a museum.  He steals parts from a local toymaker to keep up the machine; when the toymaker catches Hugo in the act, he steals the boy's pocketbook, and Hugo sets out to get it back, with the aid of the old man's goddaughter, Isabelle.<br /><br />If you simply want a family movie, then HUGO will work sufficiently.  It has a plot; it moves along at a decent pace.  But to truly appreciate how magnificent this film is, you have to approach it from an entirely different point of view: that of a film lover.  This is, in effect, a very serious, very moving, very effective film.  The acting from the two child leads, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz, is nothing short of wonderful; child actors are usually a sticking point for me, but Scorsese knows how to ring a fine performance from all of his actors (it doesn't hurt that both have already proven themselves to be talented up-and-comers).  Ben Kingsley delivers one of his best performances in years (perhaps of his entire career).  Other supporting players get to shine in their brief roles: Christopher Lee, Jude Law, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Helen McCrory, Michael Stuhlbarg, Frances de la Tour, and Richard Griffiths (it's a whole HARRY POTTER reunion) all make significant, even if minor, contributions.  Sacha Baron Cohen, as the single-minded (and strongly anti-orphan) Station Inspector, provides some of the film's weaker moments; not Cohen himself, as his performance is dependably strong, but more the character, whose slapstick shenanigans try to remind us that this is a family film.  (Cohen is clearly aware of this, and provides decent bursts of humor elsewhere, and yes, some of it tends to lean towards the "young adult" spectrum of things; younger children, fortunately, probably won't catch on, and adults will get a good belly-laugh.)<br /><br />But the true heart of HUGO lies beyond the casting.  It's Oscar-winning effects are utterly dazzling (and I only saw it in 2D; when I finally see it in 3D, as it's intended, I think my heart will stop with pure joy).  The cinematography is also just spellbinding, and also Oscar-winning (the film took home five statues, all for more technical aspects, which is appropriate because this is one of those films where even more casual movie-goers will notice things like lighting and score). Everything comes back to Scorsese's lovelorn directing; he's a man with a crush, and he's writing a brilliant love note that goes far beyond "check yes or no."  HUGO may not be Scorsese's best film, but it is certainly his most special.  Anyone with a pulse can feel the love here--and it is real, genuine, and reciprocated in full.</p></body></html>

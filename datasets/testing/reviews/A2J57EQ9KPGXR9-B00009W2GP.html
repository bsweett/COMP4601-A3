<meta name="summary" content="The critics saw another movie..."></head><body><p>I don't understand why some goofs are rushing to pan this film. Is it now cool to hate these movies? That must be the reason. It's not because this film is bad because it was great.<p>I loved this film: it's philosophy, the cinematography and the great action scenes. I went to see this movie with two other people, when it was over they both agreed that the movie was great and the critics are crazy!<p>The fight scene at the end was phenomenal, well worth the price of the ticket and the battle for Zion scene was exceptionally good. This film kicked major a$$!!<p>So why all the bad reviews? Who knows.. The Wachowski brothers have managed to turn The Matrix from a pure action film series into a credible work of science fiction, and I guess that made things too complicated for some people. <p>Anyway, follow the philosophy of the movie: think for yourself. if you want to go see the movie, then go see it.</p></body></html>

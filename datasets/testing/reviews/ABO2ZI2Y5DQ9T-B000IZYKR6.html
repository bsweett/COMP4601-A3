<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Don't Talk to a Little Girl...: Gripping Thriller with Captivating Acting from Ellen Page"></head><body><p>Already praised by some as modern-day fable based on the Little Red Riding Hood story, `Hard Candy' handles its controversial subject matter with tactful direction from the first-time director David Slade. He wisely avoided nudities or too direct descriptions of violence, but still because of exceptionally realistic acting from the two leads Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page, some parts of `Hard Candy' are very disturbing, making some of you feel not a little uncomfortable.<br /><br />In short, `Hard Candy' is a thriller or a tale of a fourteen-year-old girl who does a very bad thing to a middle-aged male who thinks he is a clever guy. It is about Hayley and Jeff, both of whom are seen engage in mind games after chatting on the net and meeting actually each other. You can easily see what Jeff is really thinking about when he meets the `little girl' at the beginning. The point is, the little girl also knows it too, and turns the tables when he asks her to drink something in his room.<br /><br />The rest of the film is about the battles, mental and physical, between these two characters. Except the brief appearance of Sandra Oh and Odessa Rae, the entire scenes are shot with only these two characters and the background about them are slowly revealed during the course of the narrative, which is greatly helped by the skillful camera work of David Slade.<br /><br />There is a surprise or two (depending on how you count) at the end of the film, but I don't think they are necessary. The film begins and develops its story finely with a cautious pace, which renders each scene very realistic, but in the second half the tightly knit settings begin to lose power with implausibility of some events and unaccountable motives of the characters. Like some B-horror films (which `Hard Candy' is not), we have to see someone refuse to do the most reasonable thing when he has to do it. I don't know how you will find it, but I for one thought the too neat conclusion is slightly disappointing because I really loved the film's mind games in its earlier section. Truly wise girl like Hayley would have done something different, more ingenious and original than the things (which I cannot tell here) you see at the end of the film.<br /><br />Whatever your reactions, you will be fascinated (or terrified) by Ellen Page who has really become a 14-year-old girl Hayley whose character easily matches Norman Bates or Hannibal Lector. The difference is she could be so nice and cute, which makes her all the more terrifying.</p></body></html>

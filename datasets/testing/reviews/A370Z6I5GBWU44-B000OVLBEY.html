By itself, it's an average thriller - nothing overwhelmingly spectacular (but some of the special effects were sweet) and nothing that's really awful (at least in my opinion) It's not a bad movie to watch on a rainy afternoon or if one's bored, but I recommend you rent 'Ghost Rider' before you buy.</p></body></html>

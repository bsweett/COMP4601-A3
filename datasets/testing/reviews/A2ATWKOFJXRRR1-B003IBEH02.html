The main reason for this is that I read (and loved) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316044938">the book by Alice Sebold</a>. Deep and richly developed characters helped round out this sometimes depressing yet engaging story surrounding the murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon ("like the fish"), and how she views her afterlife ...and looks on as her family attempts to deal with her disappearance.<br /><br />Sebold incorporated a ton of information that was crucial to our understanding within the Salmon household, and the community as a whole. But much gets lost in translation. This isn't too much of a surprise, as Hollyweird requires directors to cut-cut-cut so that movies run shorter and thus can be shown more often (i.e., a three hour movie will only show about three times in a day, whereas a two hour flick jumps up to five a day).<br /><br />Peter Jackson took on a major task here, but nothing compared to his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X9FLKM">Lord of the Rings</a> series (which I found to be brilliantly done, by the way). But Jackson is more of a visual artist. Which was wonderful for Middle Earth fans. But for fans of a story that has such a heavy character background (like this), I think he floundered a bit. In place of story, we get more stunning visuals. Although I didn't mind them (in fact, I found them wondrously eye-catching), it did tick away precious seconds and minutes that otherwise could've been put toward the characters. Fans of the book will be highly depressed to learn that there's nothing in here regarding adultery, and a time-line that is skewed so that we have a more warm and fuzzy ending. Entire characters are removed (including an Indian neighbor), while others are moved around to fit an obviously tightened time-frame for the film.<br /><br />Still, THE LOVELY BONES is entertaining. The special effects/green screen visuals will have your mouth hanging open. And Saoirse Ronan (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWNIA4">Atonement</a>) as Susie is played exceptionally well. But if you're going to watch it, you'll probably love to hate Stanley Tucci (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSDW8A">Julie & Julia</a>) as the sick and weird George Harvey, Susie's murderer. When he lures her into his trap, you can feel the skin prickling on the back of your neck. Tucci's Best Supporting Actor nod at the Oscars last year was well-earned.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book, much of what I said here probably won't mean anything. But if you have ...well ...beware.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Heavy on the action"></head><body><p>this film works well as long as Action is tops.I'd give this film a 3.5 to a 4 because of the intensity&force it starts&ends with. all the extra features make this film worth-while. you combine the Vision of Antoine Fuqua along with Jerry Bruckheimer's larger than Life vibe of film then you have a action packed film from start to finish.non-stop action&suspense from start to finish.I'm Hit&Miss with the acting,but the pacing&the action make this film for me.dug the Commentary&extra bonus features.</p></body></html>

An interesting tale of an assassin, or "facilitator", whose starting to discover that he no longer has the knack for doing what he does and forms an unlikely friendship with a man (Greg Kinnear) who helps him get out of his line of work...before his line of work puts him out.  The movie overall, spare some crude language that I wasn't real keen on, was a good watch.  I'd recommend at least renting it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Something Only A Casual Sci-Fi Fan Would Like"></head><body><p>When it comes to the Alien vs Predator films I have come to realise that if you're a hardcore Sci-Fi fan or a hardcore AVP fan then you will not like this movie.<br /><br />The Story: The predator ship is crashed back into Earth after the Predalien hybrid kills all the other predators on board. The ship crashes in the middle of a forest next to a small town which is unaware that it is to become the victim of a war between different Alien species. After the crash a predator elder sets off from the predator homeworld to do a clean-up mission and to destroy any Aliens that may be born before it arrives.<br />When the elder arrives he discovers that he has more to worry about than just the birth of a few Alien creatures, he has to deal with a whole new species.<br /><br />My Review: Going into this film I expected to enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the first. The plot was lacking somewhat when it came to character development as it seemed to just be a film building up the the massacring of most of the characters in the most gory way possible. There was a great deal of different characters in this film which didn't seem like it was giving us a main human character.<br />The gore is definitely something that the Strause brothers wanted to focus on in this film as it seemed to be neglected in the first AVP. This had a very interesting premise when compared to the first film, the first AVP was based in an underground isolated temple whereas this film was based in an American town which lead to a lot of chaos. The urban setting was something I have wanted to see the Aliens in and is something I have wanted to see the Predator in again since Concrete Jungle.<br />As explained previously this had a number of characters but what seemed to be a lack of a main human character. I felt this pulled a lot away from the movie as it didn't give us someone to root for as opposed to the first film when we had Sanaa Lathan.<br />The Strause brothers set out to make a completely different film when compared to the first and that's something they truly achieved. It's a fun popcorn movie that the casual film fan would enjoy emensely.<br /><br />Get it, you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

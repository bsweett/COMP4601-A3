While this may seem faint praise about an era far removed from ours, his vision offers an honesty and timeliness that clearly illustrates how little has changed in the last thousand years. With remarkable fidelity to actual characters and events, "Kingdom" reminds viewers that goodness is not only a Christian attribute (Ghassan Massoud's Saladin is far more sympathetic and compassionate than many 'holy' Crusaders), that even an average man, given purpose, can change the world (Orlando Bloom's Balian, a grieving blacksmith, discovers his father is a Baron, embraces the code of chivalry, and ultimately saves Jerusalem from total destruction), and that religious atrocities "in the name of God" was as ridiculous then as it is, today.<br /><br />While there are many historical inaccuracies, for cinematic purposes (Godfrey and Balian were not related, Balian did not have a love affair with Sibylla, etc.), director Scott unflinchingly shows much that was true (Jerusalem's 'King' Baldwin...a masked Edward Norton...dying from leprosy; the horrific siege of the city), and fills the screen with such detail that the film demands repeated viewings, to truly appreciate the spectacle.<br /><br />Several performances deserve mention; Orlando Bloom is very good as the central character, Balian, in certainly his best performance to date; Brendan Gleeson, as the bigoted Reynald, makes the character nearly as unsavory as the ACTUAL Reynald; Jeremy Irons is wonderful as the fictional Tiberias (based on the historic Raymond of Cyprus...Tiberias DOES have a nobler ring!), and Liam Neeson, in a role FAR too brief, gives Godfrey both humanity and nobility (although he seems to be making a career of playing hero's mentors!)<br /><br />The DVD offers a variety of terrific extras, including detailed technical information about the production (filmed in Spain and Morocco), and an overview of the Crusades, and the period of the film, with special attention paid to where the film makers diverged from historic fact.<br /><br />This is a two-disc set that certainly lives up to expectations! Any Ridley Scott film is worth owning..."Kingdom of Heaven" stands as one of his best, so need I say more?</p></body></html>

It's enriched with life, character and charm and it still manages to layer itself with the subtle illusion of grief and misery that surrounded this tragic story.  Sophia, along with a brilliant cast, was able to take a story plucked fresh from the history books and make it relatable and entertaining, refreshing amidst the modern era of the biopic.  Coppola's film here mainly focuses on the woman that was Marie Antoinette and through Kirsten Dunst's brilliant performance the audience is brought to the soul of this woman and the soul of her conflict.  She as young, she was na?ve but most of all she was lost in a world far above her head, one trust upon her, one that embraced her and then turned on her when they needed a scapegoat.<br /><br />Dunst is riveting in the title role, and the film is really a showcase for her talent.  The film starts off with Marie just a young teenager who is promised in marriage to Louis-Auguste, played by Jason Schwartzman, in order to unite the countries of France and Austria, and it carries on till just shy of her execution.  Dunst is magically able to manipulate her character so effortlessly that the audience is baffled at Marie's subtle and gradual growth as a young Queen.  Schwartzman does a wonderful job playing the young husband, a man too young for the responsibility on his shoulders and too uninterested for the wife he's been given despite her beauty and magnetism.  One could say he's overwhelmed, maybe even a bit frightened.<br /><br />Sophia Coppola brilliantly scripted this masterpiece; everything from the dialog to the musical soundtrack is inventive, effective and refreshing.  The script is especially noteworthy, giving the royal courts a modern twist that resembles the tabloid covers that litter the concession stands each week.  Having long sequences of murmured gossip, whispered rumors and lust centered jealousy help make for a memorable and relatable experience.  The costume designs and set pieces are magical and add so many lavish layers to the already layered biopic.  The scenes blossoming forth with colorful fabrics, high fashion inspired shoes and pastries add visual depth to the reality that this Queen was just like every other young girl and helps make her more real to us.<br /><br />Marie Antoinette's devotion to her newfound country is stifled by her husband's refusal to consummate their marriage and her dire frustration in her inability to provide an heir that would unite her birthland with her homeland transcends right to the audience.  Marie Antoinette was a tragically misunderstood woman who did all that she could in a situation she had no control over.<br /><br />The supporting cast does a fine job as well, Judy Davis and Rip Torn sinking their teeth into their small roles, and Asia Argento is fantastically catty as the Kings mistress, but it's Rose Byrne that really stands out to me.  Her brazen obnoxious almost impish sexuality writhes off the screen and into the seat next to you and makes a very long lasting impression.  Danny Huston and Marianne Faithfull are brilliant if not sorely underused, but like I've stated, this movie is all about Marie Antoinette and its focus from her never wavers.  She's in just about every frame and as we watch her move from na?ve young girl to loving mother and wife to confused, hated and betrayed Queen we are moved for her, to her and with her in this brilliantly paced and expertly crafted masterpiece.</p></body></html>

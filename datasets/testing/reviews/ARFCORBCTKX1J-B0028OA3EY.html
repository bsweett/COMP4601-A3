It has one of the most thrilling action sequences I've seen in a long time. It has a clean, spare script and Kevin Spacey's tightly wound, near-psychotic Lex Luthor. The story line not only connects logically with the first two films, but builds on the "Superman as Christ-figure" theme and brings it to a logical conclusion. Several scenes reference "2001: A Space Odyssey", a film with similar thematic elements. * Not to mention the outstanding cinematography and magnificent production design. And it has Bryan Singer's nearly perfect direction, reminding us that he also directed "The Usual Suspects", which the X films did not.<br /><br />So why haven't I given it five stars? Brandon Routh.<br /><br />George Reeves and Christopher Reeve truly inhabited the role. The brought to it an earnest intensity, acting as if they really believed they were this preposterous super-being. Note particularly the scene in the Donner version of "Superman II" where Reeve removes his glasses and stares at Lois, and he _is_ Superman, though in Clark Kent's clothes.<br /><br />Routh largely wanders through the film, an actor in a costume. We never believe he's Superman because _he_ never seems to believe it. When Luthor's goons beat him to a pulp, and Luthor pierces him with a kryptonite shiv, our reaction is more one of embarrassment than sympathy or pity. My attention was drawn to Superman's cape, which looks like a cheap vinyl shower curtain.<br /><br />This failing can be laid at Bryan Singer's feet, who cast and directed Routh. An actor playing Superman needs, more than anything else, "screen presence". Reeves and Reeve had it. Routh does not.<br /><br />Unless Routh dramatically improves, or someone finds a better actor, the future does not look bright for the Superman franchise.<br /><br />* After 28 years, I finally noticed that the three final notes of the opening section of John Williams' main theme (dah dah-da-da-dah, dum, dum, dum) are the Zarathustra "World Riddle" theme in reverse.</p></body></html>

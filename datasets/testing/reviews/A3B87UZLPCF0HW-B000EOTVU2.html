<meta name="summary" content="One hell of a creepy movie"></head><body><p>Three back-packers travel across the huge Australian outback searching for adventure. Stopping off at Wolf Creek's meteor crater, Ben (Phillips), Liz (Magrath) and Kristy (Morassi) find that their car battery has packed in. Just when they start to appreciate they're hopelessly stranded in the middle of nowhere, help arrives in the shape of, Mick Taylor (Jarrett). All hell breaks loose. Liz wakes up alone from a drug-induced sleep to find herself bound and gagged, and that Mick has gone all torture and brutal on them. Not knowing where she is or how to get out of there, how can Liz help her friends escape from the mad man? Jarratt gives a creepy, real to life performance as a murderous psychopath.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The most mature HP movie yet!"></head><body><p>It's the fourth year for everyone's favorite boy wizard Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe). During his summer stay with the rotten Aunt Petuna and Uncle Vernon (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffths), he is out somewhere with his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) until a death-eater attacks him as Harry uses magic to get rid of his as it is nearly gets him in trouble with the ministry for underaged wizardy in the real world. He does return back to the world of magic to Hogwarts, Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) is back as he gives Harry some warnings that could lead him to certain dangers ahead. A new teacher named Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Stauton) seems to be in charge of some of the students making them be almost like if it was the army, Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) with Harry, Hermonine (Emma Watson), Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and Ron (Rupert Grin) with other students secretly vow to go against what the ministry and even go into war preparation.<br /><br />Co-starring Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, Helen Bonna Carter, Maggie Smith, Tom Felton, Robert Hardy, Warwick Davis with the original cast of Hogwarts from the other movies and with cameo by Robert Pattison. This is more about learning about friendship, sacrifice and about the power of freedom as those are the major themes of this installment even being a bit about getting pressure due to the system as you can crush it. Here you get to meet more interesting creatures like the goofy if lovable giant known as Grawpy and more with more improved special effects that doesn't overdo the brilliant storytelling. Sure there are some cuts and changes from the book but no adaptation of a movie is perfect, it's just a great installment i recommend and is the smartest movie of the series.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives you flawless perfect HD picture and surround sound like if you saw it in the theater. The extras are quite good too like additional scenes, set tour, featurettes, production diaries and the magic of editing featurette.</p></body></html>

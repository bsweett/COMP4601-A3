<meta name="summary" content="The movie was longer than the conquest of the world"></head><body><p>You know that time of your life when you're at a pool. You're watching the kids, her kids, grand kids, your kids. Kids. And one of them, very dry and as yet unimmersed, goes up to Mom and says, "Mom, how do I dive into the water?" And she says 'honey, you have to get wet first. Go on. Jump in the pool.'<br /><br />OK. Granted it's kind of a stretch but stay with me. Alexander's bisexualty. Oliver. Do it or don't. Pained stares, lots of mascara and 12-step hugs don't do it. It's almost 2006.<br /><br />Stone does great work and like successful directors in a whimsical industry, success is sometimed marred by failure. Or worse, mediocrity. Wall Street, Platoon, 4th of July, Nixon, are juxtaposed against JFK and Heaven and Earth. And one thing's for certain. Alexander ain't great and it might be in the latter category. It seems there might have been some areas that could have been avoided.<br /><br />You know I don't think the bisexualty issue is a big deal but you have to admit, it's a hot topic. It's kind of like gay marriages in the last election. It's bound to attract a stream of negativity. It's a lightening rod. I believe that from an accuracy point of view, it's really hard to say what a person's sexualty is now, much less 2000 years ago. Hell. We don't even know what Bubba's sexuality was. How are we supposed to know Alexander's?<br /><br />And then there's that 'one foot in the water one foot out' approach. Come on Oliver. You're the Director. Make a decision.<br /><br />The scenes tainted in red. The Val Kilmer trip to the blood cave. These are things right out of the 60's. It reminded me of Peter Fonda as Captain America in the cemetery scene. Yeah. You know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />And the dialogue. I couldn't understand 1/2 of it because of the background noise. And I just think these were vicious, pagan times when a whole lot of brain-picking and dialoguing and networking just didn't go on.<br /><br />And the 'lets treat our enemies like our friends and return them to positions of power 'cause we're all equals under the same God . . . or multiple Gods.' Man that didn't happen after WWII and I'm pretty certain it didn't happen after the Macedonians sacked Persia and everything else in their path.<br /><br />One last point. The speeches. If you think that Alexander gave speeches on Honor and Loyalty and a Tranquil Homelife and Glory and Equality to 100,000 men, you deserve this movie.<br /><br />Jolie is great as Olympias although, didn't you think Alexander's mother should have been a little less hot and older? Colin Farrell, good actor, great hair. Not in the Heston, Burton, Douglas (Kirk. Please), Crowe mold.<br /><br />Damn tedious. You want something good? Read Pressfield's "Gates of Fire." Great characters; great scenes; great descrptions; little dialogue. 2 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Moore Ignites a Sharp Expos&eacute; on the Dysfunctional State of U.S. Health Care"></head><body><p>It's no secret what a travesty privatized health care has become in this country, but leave it to political firebrand and social provocateur Michael Moore to present our dismal situation with his unique combination of passion and insouciance in this compelling 2007 documentary. Coupled with his innate showmanship, his dexterity in making his viewpoint seem like the logical one is what makes his films resonate in ways that make more fair-minded filmmakers pallid by comparison. This time, his target is almost too easy, that the entire health care industry needs to be overhauled. In order to prepare for his film, Moore made an open online plea to Americans to share their own health-care horror stories, and in turn, he received over 25,000 e-mails.<br /><br />The film's first half dives into the most egregious cases of those who paid their insurance premiums to feel secure about their medical coverage only to discover that their insurance companies abandon them when they needed them the most. Several of these accounts are inevitably heartbreaking, and Moore is wise to let those victimized by the system speak for themselves without his prodding. The capper is the 1996 Congressional testimony of Dr. Linda Peeno, a former medical examiner for Humana, who confesses that her top priority was to save the company money and how in turn, the company rewarded bonuses to examiners who denied the most number of claims. The second half shows Moore in more familiar form as he acerbically visits Canada, Great Britain, France, and Cuba, all countries where free health care is available.<br /><br />The international section is where Moore makes his most pointed jabs in showing how socialized medicine has worked almost too effortlessly elsewhere. Although he does not divulge the substantial amount of government funding needed to subsidize these programs, Moore successfully makes the intentional oversight beside the point, as these nations simply emphasize how dysfunctional our HMO system has become. Former Member of Parliament Tony Benn is particularly insightful in explaining the rationale behind free medical care in the U.K. and how it was borne out of the ongoing bombings going on during WWII. The most interesting and controversial sequence is when Moore takes a group of perpetually ill 9/11 volunteers by boat first to Guantanamo Bay to see if they can receive the same medical treatment being received by the terrorists imprisoned there and then to Havana to get the health care they have been denied in this country.<br /><br />The filmmaker somehow manages the precarious balance between funny and poignant throughout the film. He, however, is not without his self-aggrandizing moments, for example, in taking the occasional potshot at Bush, which while funny, is not terribly relevant here. What is pertinent is a taped conversation in 1971 between Nixon and his chief aide John Ehrlichman about passing legislation which would give birth to the current, profit-seeking concept of HMOs. Moore couldn't help himself by mentioning an anonymous $12,000 check to the Webmaster of an anti-Moore site, who could not afford his wife's mounting medical bills. Naturally, the anonymous donor was Moore. Regardless, he hits his valid points about the U.S. health care system hard and with both emotional precision and idiosyncratic finesse. For that alone, this film is essential viewing.</p></body></html>

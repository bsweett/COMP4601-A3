<meta name="summary" content="Mission accomplished"></head><body><p>Pulling off stunts that could only be accomplished by Batman or a committed Scientologist, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), backed up by his IMF team (Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, & Jonathan Rhys Meyers), leaps into action once again to rescue his wife and prevent sinister arms dealer Owen Davies from getting his mitts on a mysterious weapon known only as the Rabbit's Foot.<br /><br />This is a hugely entertaining film.  TV autuer J.J. Abrams shows that he has what it takes to make it on the big screen, efficiently stringng together an exhausting sequence of major action set pieces with just enough plot to provide context without getting in the way of the thrills.  Some reviewers have complained that we never learn what the Rabbit's Foot is, but I think that is just Abrams's affectionate joke on the action movie genre that recognizes that it doesn't *matter* what it is, just so long as everyone is desperate to get their hands on it.  A major step up from the terrible MI:II and definitely more coherent than the first one.</p></body></html>

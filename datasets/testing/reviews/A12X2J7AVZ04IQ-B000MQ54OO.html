Peril seems to be an issue, but lessons are learned from those in peril; anyone remember "Pinocchio" or "Peter Pan" or "Bambi"? Also, Robin Williams gave some ethnic impressions (very well, I thought, and entertaining). This was necessary because the "Hispanic" penguins were of another tribe. What's the fuss? My problem was that it started out too slow, too much time setting the scene. Once it got going, I had no problem keeping up. Narrow minded people have forgotten that ethnic characters have been a part of cartoon history, so why complain now (anyone remember Babba-Looie, or the speech impediment of Elmer Fudd?). Lighten up, for God's sake. I liked "Cars", too, only because I hit the old Route 66 and was dismayed. Both are good films.</p></body></html>

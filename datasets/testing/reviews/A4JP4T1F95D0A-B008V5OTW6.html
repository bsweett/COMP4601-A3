A nice score and beautiful shots go a long way in this movie about the slaughter of the Israeli athletes and the response to that action.  The scting is top notch, and the story based on true events is riveting.  The movie does go a bit long at 2 hours and 40 minutes.  I think Spielberg could have been a bit less self indulgent and made some trims to move the story along better.<br /><br />The action is very bloody.  Some sexual situations with one scene of nudity.  Cursing is fairly light, but overall this is certainly an adults only movie.  One thing I was surprised at was the balance view Spielberg gave between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  Being Jewish I would have thought that he would make them more the heroes.</p></body></html>

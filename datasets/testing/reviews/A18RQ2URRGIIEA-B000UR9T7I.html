<meta name="summary" content="Lots of Eyecandy Cannot Replace a Weak Plot That Has Too Many Antagonists"></head><body><p>For the third installment of the "Spider-Man" film franchise that was released in 2007, director Sam Raimi (who directed the first two "Spider-Man" films in 2002 and 2004) also took on the role of screenwriter.  While Raimi is no stranger to taking on both roles, 15 years had elapsed since the last time he both directed and wrote a film, and that was for the 1992 horror/comedy "Army of Darkness", which was part of the ongoing "Evil Dead" film franchise.  Assisting Raimi in writing the screenplay for "Spider-Man 3" was his brother Ivan, who also cowrote "Army of Darkness" in 1992, but had not done any writing since his involvement as a writer in the very short-lived (13 episodes) 1997 TV series called "Spy Game".  Assisting the brothers in writing "Spider-Man 3" screenplay was writer Alvin Sargent, who wrote the screenplay for the 2004 "Spider-Man 2"; but it was the Raimi brothers who took full credit for writing the "Spider-Man 3" screen story.  Thus, unlike the first two "Spider-Man" films, "Spider-Man 3" was predominantly a Sam & Ivan Raimi effort; and the results were rather disappointing:  whereas the plot & characters of the first two films were interesting & engaging, neither can be said for the characters & plot of the third film.<br /><br />The film begins with Peter Parker, alias Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), planning to propose to his long-time love Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) after she is highly criticized for her role in a musical play and is subsequently replaced.  Being totally oblivious to Mary Jane's pain over this for the entire film, Peter is instead preoccupied with his own ego & glory when the city of New York presents him with an award.  In the meantime, an escaped criminal, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), is accidentally transformed into the Sandman while fleeing police; and Harry Osborn (James Franco) is bent on destroying Peter/Spider-Man because of his father.  Later, Peter becomes the host to an alien symbiont creature that brings out the worst in Peter & Spider-Man; but he manages to separate himself from the creature only for it to join with a photography rival, Edward 'Eddie' Brock (Topher Grace), who becomes a new nemesis for Spider-Man named Venom.<br /><br />Thus, Raimi made the third installment of "Spider-Man" have three criminals: the Sandman, Harry as the new Goblin, and Venom.  On the surface, this sounds exciting; but in writing an engaging & character-driven plot, this becomes a liability when providing sufficient background & screen time to develop three completely separate characters, each of which must do battle with Spider-Man, as well as provide sufficient screen time to develop the relationship between Peter & Mary Jane.  The result: a plot weakened by too many antagonists, inadequate character development for the antagonists, and the unfortunate transformation of Peter from an engaging protagonist in the first two films to a non-engaging one in the third.  Especially damaging to Peter's character were the jazz club dance scene and his attempt at acting cool on the sidewalk (albeit under the influence of the alien symbiant), that not only turned the heads of bystanders (film extras) on the streets of New York in disgust, but many members of the audience as well.  So, in spite of lavish special effects of Spider-Man swinging his way through New York and doing battle with his three foes, the disjoint relationship between Peter & Mary Jane take away from the excitement of the final climatic battle, as well as the loss of interest already felt by many in the audience by the time the climax occurs.<br /><br />With great special effects & wonderful cinematography, but a poor plot and non-engaging characters, I can only rate "Spider-Man 3" with 2 out of 5 stars.  A fourth film has been announced with Stan Lee as executive producer, but no announcements have been made regarding who will direct, write or act in this proposed 2009 release as the contracts that Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst signed were only for three "Spider-Man" films.</p></body></html>

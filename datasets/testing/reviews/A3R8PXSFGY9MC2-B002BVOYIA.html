<meta name="summary" content="Hotel Rwanda"></head><body><p>This is a powerful movie about a turbulent time that was ignored by the west whilst it occurred. It has some poignant and powerful performances, with Cheadle really shining. It is quite hard hitting and not easy (emotionally) to watch in places, but it keeps you hooked and engrossed the whole time. It has even more impact when you realise this is based on a true story. This is a fantastic film and one I highly recommend. Well worth a viewing.</p></body></html>

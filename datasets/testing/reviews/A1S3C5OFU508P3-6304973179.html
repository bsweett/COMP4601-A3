<meta name="summary" content="One of the top five science fiction action movies of all time"></head><body><p>This movie is one of the most engaging and intense science fiction movies ever made. An alien lands in the jungles of Central America and is on a hunt with humans serving as the prey. Armed with high-tech weapons and an invisibility screen, it can move through the jungles at will, but can be injured by firearms.<br /> Arnold Schwarzenegger is the leader of a team of mercenaries sent into the jungles of Central America by the American CIA. Their mission is supposedly to rescue some hostages and they easily defeat the human troops they encounter. However, the situation is reversed when they encounter the predator and it becomes a life-and-death battle. Most of the team is killed and it comes down to a one-on-one between Schwarzenegger and the alien. The climactic battle pits the alien and the high technology against Schwarzenegger and his guile and ability to fashion simple and effective weapons out of jungle materials.<br /> This movie also has some of the best dialog of all science fiction movies and Jessie Ventura was particularly impressive as a member of the mercenary team. My favorite science fiction movie of all time is Aliens and this one is not far behind.</p></body></html>

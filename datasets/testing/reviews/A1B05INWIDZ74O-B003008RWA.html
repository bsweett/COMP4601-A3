For he does make sure that everything is shown to support his preconceived idea. You know that once he starts he is going to be supporting his personal view. And that is seen in this film. I know how bad Cuba's health system is for the normal person and this film does not come close to showing it. We only get to see where the elite of Cuba go for healthcare. And we do not get to see those who wait trying to get specialist care in the "free" systems like France. It would be nice to see the good and bad of each system.<br /><br />Now with all that I have to say that even though his scenes are "cherry-picked", everything that Mr. Moore shows in his film about our Insurance system is quite accurate. In the richest country in the world with the best doctors and most advanced technology we have too many people going without required care. And his includes both medical procedures and prescriptions. I have seen a five year paperwork trail of someone insured by one of the largest health insurance companies in the U.S.A., with full health coverage, that was denied coverage for a piece of durable equipment that was required. This person could not wait for insurance so the equipment was purchased and claim filed, of course the claim was denied. After the five years of appeals, including involvement by his Senator and the U.S Department of Health, the piece of equipment was approved. But guess what? A letter was sent saying they, the insurance company, would not pay for the durable equipment bought because it was the "wrong" brand!<br /><br />Most of our medical practitioners and all prescription companies have no compassion. All that matters is the bottom line, greed. We may have very good quality medical care, if you can get it that is. Having insurance is only for those who really do not need it. And even if you do have great insurance, it does not mean you are covered at all. So obviously the United States is in need of healthcare reform. And I do hope that everyone sees this film with an open mind. I know it shows only extremes, but what someone should realize that in the United States, not one citizen should have to go without required prescriptions or medical care regardless of its cost. And no one should have to choose between his or her life and their home.<br /><br />We all know nothing is free, a free system would mean increase taxes. But let us see what those taxes would be and put it on a ballot so that the people can vote on the systems they want. The taxes might not be that much higher overall. Or perhaps the single payer system. No matter what anyone thinks of Michael Moore, hopefully this fill will increase the discourse on the U.S.A.'s healthcare system. This is the best film he has produced yet.</p></body></html>

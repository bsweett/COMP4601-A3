<meta name="summary" content="Finally, a decent vampire film"></head><body><p>Let The Right One In is one of the best horror films to come out in the past few years. This subtle film centers around an introverted boy who befriends the daughter of his next door nieghbor. Their relationship grows stronger to the point where the girl tells the boy that she is a vampire.<br /><br />Unlike the Lost Boys, the girl's life is not all fun and games but rather a violent, bloody struggle to survive and stay hidden. The main question in the movie, what makes it really interesting, is the girl vampire actually friends with the boy or is a means to an end? This question gets bounced around throughout the film but is never completely answered. The child actors in this movie are very good which is partly the reason for my 4-star rating. Well worth your time and $$.</p></body></html>

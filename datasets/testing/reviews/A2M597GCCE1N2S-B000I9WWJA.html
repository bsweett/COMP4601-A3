<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, REALLY good movie!!!"></head><body><p>Inside Man is probably one of the best movies Spike Lee has ever made. I will admit, as many other reviewers have done, that this is probably Spike's best movie since "Malcom X," and, "Do The Right Thing." Denzel Washington [who can do no wrong with another stellar performance] teams with Spike Lee again in this highly charged movie that has you guessing from the moment of the classic line, "This ain't no bank robbery!"<br /><br />Denzel Washington stars as NYPD detective/negotiator, Keith Frazier, who is placed in the difficult situation of a Wall Street bank robbery, where 40+ people are being held hostage by a genius bank robber, Dalton Russel [played by Clive Owen] Russel is the type of movie villian that you can't help but like. He is one determined, cool talking, take no chances man, who even claims to have the perfect bank robbery plan anyone has ever had. Frazier must match wits, brains, and intelligence with Russel in order to save the lives of the people in the bank.<br /><br />There are several scenes such as; Owen and Washington's characters bumping into each other right before the robbery takes place, and the other cops that don't believe Washington's character when he starts to wonder if there is more to this robbery than what it appears, that I found slighly annoying [since I had seen them in many other bank robbing movies]. But those are just minor things probably only myself care about [I can't help myself] and I guarantee you they won't bother the rest of the movie at all.<br /><br />I thought the best scenes were with with Frazier and Russel talking to each other, they seemed to have a war of words and dealings throughout a good portion of the movie. Plus the action with Russel and his small team of bank robbers taking on the police SWAT teams is enough to satisfy anyone's taste of gunfights. The ending of the movie is really superb, at least it was to me, and I definately recommend seeing this from start to finish to enjoy it even more.<br /><br />Extras include:<br /><br />Commentary by Spike Lee<br /><br />The Making of Inside Man<br /><br />Featurette #4 - Spike Lee and Denzel Washington discuss their collaborations of the movie<br /><br />More than 25 minutes [that's a lot!] of deleted scenes<br /><br />and three different subtitles [English, Spanish, and French]<br /><br />This is one movie that you should see if you want to see a suspenseful, action thriller that has as much action as it does great acting, and it has a great cast for acting. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

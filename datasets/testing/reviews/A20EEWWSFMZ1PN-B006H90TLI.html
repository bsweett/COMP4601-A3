<meta name="summary" content="A cheap Fargo knockoff"></head><body><p>A pointless program with pointless scenes starting from nowhere and going to nowhere. This could pass time but it has no social redeeming value. All there is is violence for violence sake and then maybe not for that.  Dogs get shot and we have to drive in 80's vehicles.<br /><br />The actors must have been hard up for a film to make. Same people are major ascots and all I can think is that someone must have had something on them because you could not pay them enough to compromise their career.<br /><br />It is the primitive pre-cell 80's. The unsuspecting good greedy victim was decided to be made a two true Vietnam (60's) person; this is supposed to make him cunning and maybe dangerous.  I spent two tours and I am anything but cunning or dangerous. And I never saw a Remington 700BDL (designed for snipers.)  Not saying they did not exist but we did things the old fission way with M14's (No bolts) accurate enough for Government work.<br /><br />On the plus side is that the Texas country was beautiful and Tommy Lee Jones can still make an interesting face.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640SB">Men in Black - Tommy Lee Jones(Deluxe Edition)</a></p></body></html>

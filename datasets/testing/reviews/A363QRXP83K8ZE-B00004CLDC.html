It's based on the Nicholas Pileggi true crime book about Henry Hill, a low-level hood in the Lucchese crime family in the 60s and 70s.  Tracing his rise from fetcher for local mafiosi in his  50s Brooklyn neighborhood, the film tracks Henry to the end of the line: the Federal Witness Protection program.  Along the way Scorsese stages some great scenes, charting the dangerous, thrilling, and ultimately miserable life of a mob hustler.  Ray Liotta has a perfect sleaza factor working as Hill.  However, he is almost too nice to be convincing as the same guy in the source book.  The real Henry Hill comes off as a real lowlife in the book, a guy who deserves no sympathy.  Ironically, years after leaving the program Hill now runs a website, writes wiseguy-related books, and calls into Howard Stern, though he's still watching his back.  <p>The cast is Classic Mafia Cast.  Robert DeNiro plays the greedy and devious Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway, Joe Pesci plays Joe Pesci in an Oscar-winning role(!) that basically defined the Pesci persona for life, and Paul Sorvino plays a portly Mob captain who has an amazing scene where he emotes while frying up some tasty sausages, tears in his eyes, handing Henry a massive wad of cash.<p>The film can't be recommended enough.  It was robbed at Oscar time, criminally losing to Dances With Wolves, but it doesn't matter.  This has sealed itself as one of the ultimate guy films of all time.<p>Unfortunately, the DVD is absolutely appalling.  You actual have to flip the disc over in the middle of the film to finish it.  This is simply unacceptable.  I haven't seen another like it, I mean, why bother with the DVD format?  The film looks and sound just fine, it's great, but how about some extras?  This film was highly praised and will hold up for a long time, so how about something?  <p>Not sure if Scorsese can be bothered or has not been asked to do special edition discs of more of his films.  The Taxi Driver DVD is very nice, for instance.  Goodfellas has a trailer, whoopee, and again, it's two-sided.  Lame.<p>Buy if you've never seen this, else if you have a widescreen VHS this DVD won't offer you a whole lot.</p></body></html>

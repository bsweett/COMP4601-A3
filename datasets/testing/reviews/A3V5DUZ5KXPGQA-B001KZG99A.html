The turning point was when my own father (who's around 60) went to the film and liked it! I then said, "I've got to see this one now!"<br /><br />I am glad I did! While it isn't an Oscar winner, it is definitely for action lovers and comic fans! Robert Downey, Jr. definitely had Tony Stark down cold! A selfish industrialist who is forced to change his ways and outlook on life after an attack leaves his body shattered and forces him to create the machine that would become his "costume" for justice as Iron Man.<br /><br />Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow do a great job as their respective characters. I've personally never thought of Paltrow as hot but she did change my mind with the shape she got herself in for this film! HMMM!<br /><br />Back to the movie, this isn't a waste of money. That's for sure! Buy it today!</p></body></html>

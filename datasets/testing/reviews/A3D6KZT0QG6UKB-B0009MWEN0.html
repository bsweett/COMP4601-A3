Do I need to say anything more about the violence?<p>Verhoeven  apparently liked the Heinlein book enough to make the movie but since  Heinlein wanted to be in the U.S. military and Verhoeven spent his youth in  a Nazi occupied country, their takes on the military's ability to solve all  the world's problems are a little different.<p>Basically this movie is a  different entity altogether. He throws in a love story or two, a lot of  cynicism and Doogie Howser in an SS uniform. The 90210 crowd is on screen  forever, but thankfully most of them are hacked to bits before the end of  the movie, something that never happened on 90210 sadly.<p>Great looking  bugs, action sequences that just keep going and a nasty perspective make  this into one of the best evil movies to come along in a long time. Think  Robocop but without the restraint.</p></body></html>

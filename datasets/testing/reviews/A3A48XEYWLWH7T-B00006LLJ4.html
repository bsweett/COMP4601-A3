Set in the future, another of those grainy monochromatic futures, Tom Cruise heads up the pre-crime division.  A trio of pre-cogs floats in a watery like womb dispensing images of murders that will be committed unless stopped.  Tom and his crew have that job.  One of the coolest things in the movie is the interaction with the flat panel LCDs of the future which appear to be glass and optic based.  Tom wears VR gloves [anyone remember the old Mattel glove? No?] and interacts with the system like a conductor with hand movements opening images, sliding things around, pretty nice.  About the only other thing of interest is the traffic in the future crawls up and down buildings vertically like cockroaches as well as horizontally on the ground.  The story is standard whodunit fare leading back to Brewmeister Smith as usual.  Has Max ever played a hero outside of Bergman? &lt;g&gt;  Anyhow, beyond the philosophical issues of pre-determination and causality there really just isn't much to the story, nothing compels us to like or care about these characters.  The near future's product placement with the GAP and bottled water only ads to the dead and depressing ambience.  Worth a look for free on cable I suppose.</p></body></html>

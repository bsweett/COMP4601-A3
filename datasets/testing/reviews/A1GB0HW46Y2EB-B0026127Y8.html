The plot is mindless and the writing amateurish.  For openers, the character of his daughter is portrayed as a selfish, unappreciative, spoiled brat for whom I would have trouble leaving the house to rescue.  After his rich characterisation of Oskar Schindler, Neeson's speech over the phone, threatening the kidnapper, is embarrassing.<br /><br />As a whole the picture is contrived, predictable and completely unbelievable.</p></body></html>

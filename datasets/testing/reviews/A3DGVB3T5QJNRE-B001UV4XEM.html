<meta name="summary" content="An Incredibly Boring Film For Brainless Audiences!"></head><body><p>I love humor, it's one of my favorite film genres. And I like all kinds of outrageous comedy ranging from<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MMMT9G">Borat - Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan </a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DDGU">There's Something More About Mary</a>  to Spike Lee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006QAIG4">She Hate Me</a>. I laughed so hard during these films I thought I would fall out of my seat! This proves I'm certainly not a prude or squeamish!<br /><br />But The Hangover is such a bad film I barely chuckled or even smiled! Anyone who has ever experienced - or dealt with people who have been physically and/or sexually abused will probably feel a bit disturbed by seeing simulated sexual abuse, and calling it funny! I have to admit, I finally walked out of the theater because beside being depraved in a bad way the film was also desperately boring! I could care less about any of the main characters! And the humor was so unimaginative and forced!<br /><br />The film's trailers fooled me into thinking The Hangover would be worth checking out. It's not the first time a trailer was much better than the film, nor will it be the last.Unfortunately, I wasted $10.00 during a recession. The next time I see something as bad as The Hangover, I intend to get a refund!<br /><br />For those who think child abuse is not funny see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738206210">Licensing Parents: Can We Prevent Child Abuse And Neglect?</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0380786958">Raising Safe Kids in an Unsafe World: 30 Simple Ways to Prevent Your Child from Being Lost, Abducted, or Abused</a></p></body></html>

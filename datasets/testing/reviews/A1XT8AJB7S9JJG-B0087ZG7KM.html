<meta name="summary" content="A funny movie, but would have been better if I say it earlier.  Did not live up to the hype. Still worth watching. I say B"></head><body><p>"Why can't you be happy for me and then go home and talk about me behind my back like a normal person?" After being asked to be the maid of honor to her friend Lillian (Rudolph), Annie's (Wiig) life that is already in disarray becomes even more so. After thinking she is being replaced as best friend she tries too hard to compensate. Almost ruining the wedding in the process. This movie has what I call the "Due Date" or "Hangover" curse. Like those movies, the first people to see it, before the hype and word of mouth got out of control think this is great and hilarious. People like me who have waited a little too long and have outrageous expectations are left disappointed. Going in thinking this is the female "Hangover" I was excited. While I can see the comparisons, it was more chick-flicky then I was expecting. While this did have funny parts and I did laugh it wasn't as good as expected. Overall, this is a good movie, but because of the expectations I had I didn't like it as much as I thought. I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I might, just to see if it's better the second time.<br /><br />*Also try - Something Borrowed & The Sweetest Thing</p></body></html>

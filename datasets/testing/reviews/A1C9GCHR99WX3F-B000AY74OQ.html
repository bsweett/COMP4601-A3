<meta name="summary" content="Dreamworks is back with Madagascar!"></head><body><p>This is the only movie so far this year that I took in a movie theatre, so I don't know how many more movies I will see in a movie theatre before 2005 comes to an end. I still saw this film, even if it got bad reviews from the movie critics, but you can bet that you might be laughing at lot, in a movie theatre, but if you see this again, at home, you might find yourself wondering why you were laguhing in the movie theatre. On his 10th birthday, zebra Marty (voice of Chris Rock) spends the day peforming for the crowds at the Central Park Zoo, but that evening he is visited by pengins that are seeking, to get out of New York. Which gives him an idea to leave the zoo, but then best friend Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), discovers that he is missing, and he, Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer from TV's Friends), escape from the zoo, to track down their missing friend, they track him down, and even up on a ship be shipped to Africa. But then, they are thrown off the boat, and are reunited on a desert island, that looks deserted, but it lead by King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen, TV's notorious Ali G). If you love Dreamworks animated movies, then catch up with Madagascar, but parents be warned that this has a PG rating, which is the usual rating that Dreamworks gets for thier animated movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Untoppable"></head><body><p>This is a taut and suspenseful action thriller with excellent lead performances from Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson.<br /><br />Based on a true incident, the film tells the tale of a runaway freight train that threatens to derail around a curve in Stanton, PA, spewing its load of toxic chemicals on the surrounding community.<br /><br />Bucking the unfortunate trend of DVDs packing minimal extras, this disc includes both a commentary by director Tony Scott as well as an informative "making-of" featurette that impresses the viewer with the scope of the production and the director's insistence on shooting as much as possible "in the camera" -- i.e. no CGI effects.<br /><br />Though stopping the runaway train is the primary story here, the vet engineer and rookie conductor played by Washington and Pine have credible back stories that give their relationship an additional edge.  Dawson lends strong support as the dispatcher who is trying to keep track of the situation as it spins out of control due to an arrogant and inept engineer and bad calls by a bottom-line-driven railroad exec.<br /><br />Action thriller fans will be munching fistfuls of popcorn as the runaway train picks up speed, and fans of good acting will appreciate the star turns of the leads.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

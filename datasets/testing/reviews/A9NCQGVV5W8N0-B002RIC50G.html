<meta name="summary" content="More Ham Than Human..."></head><body><p>Despite the presence of the stunning Gong Li sauntering about in a silky bathrobe and a fairly decent performance from Gaspard Ulliel, I still have to summarise this film with a pronounced and very distinct "meh", simply because the sheer nastiness present in Harris' other tales of the good doctor was missing and because of some very lazy continuity. Simply put, when viewed in light of what comes later in the illustrious doctor's career, all credibility goes out of the window. It would have made far more sense if said cannibalistic killer had gone by a different name in Europe and had adopted the name 'Hannibal Lecter' upon entering Canada /America. That I could've forgiven. As it is, this film just doesn't make sense with regard to the continuity of the series.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A poignant and unique coming-of-age vampire tale"></head><body><p>"Let the Right One In" is a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but 'Let the Right One In' is so-well directed and well-cast that all of these themes fall seamlessly into place within the almost 2 hrs running time.<br /><br />I was riveted from beginning till the end, and the one word that kept coming back to me as I watched this movie was "hypnotic" - the story is of 12-year-old Oskar [Kare Hedebrant] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Oskar doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow abounding all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Oskar meets a strange girl named Eli [Lina Leandersson] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Despite this, the pair are drawn to each other, even while Oskar updates his scrapbook with the latest news of gruesome murders in his town, where the victims are tied up and strung upside down before having their blood drained. Much later, Oskar who is by now completely infatuated with Eli, learns a shocking truth that has some important repercussions on both his friendship with Eli and for those around him.<br /><br />"Let the Right One In" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Oskar & Eli learn to manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role - Eli commands Oskar to stand up for himself, and later Oskar finds himself as Eli's protector.<br /><br />The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire "I must be gone and live, or stay and die" - a young yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.<br /><br />"Let the Right One In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see.</p></body></html>

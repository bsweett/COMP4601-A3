<meta name="summary" content="Very enjoyable romp"></head><body><p>For me this is one of the most clever and funny films I'v seen in many years. For all it's cartoonist qualities there are still many touching scenes with emotional depth. I'v shown this film to many friends, and during viewing once they "get it" where this film is coming from it's fun to watch them giggle, guffaw and bust out in laughter. It's very "Chinese" and universal at the same time. Watch it!</p></body></html>

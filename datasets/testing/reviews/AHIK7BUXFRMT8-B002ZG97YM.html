<meta name="summary" content="A Delightful Fantasy Family Movie"></head><body><p>Both my wife and I really enjoyed this film; now that's saying a lot, especially where my wife is concerned as she will often walk out on a video we are watching after the first few minutes if she doesn't like it. This is a captivating family film that features a compelling story and interesting characters.<br /><br />Both the video and audio are top notch with the action battle scenes with the dragons dramatically involving the surround speakers; one definitely gets a feeling of being in the middle of the action!<br /><br />I believe this one will bear up to repeated viewings even for the adults, it's a fun movie!</p></body></html>

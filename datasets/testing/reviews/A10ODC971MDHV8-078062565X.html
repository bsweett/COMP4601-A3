<meta name="summary" content="King Kong (1933)"></head><body><p>Warner Home Entertainment has surpassed itself with this painstaking restoration of the 1933 adventure/horror classic. The movie has not looked this good in my lifetime, which only reinforces how well "Kong" stands up as entertainment after over seventy years. The groundbreaking stop-motion effects work of Willis O'Brien are on full display, and while the acting style is decidedly pre-Method, the story enthralls, and the picture moves briskly along to that immortal climax atop the Empire State Building. An early sound masterpiece from directors Merian C. Cooper (who also helped originate the story) and Ernest B. Schoedsack. This still outshines both re-makes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Silly Abandon"></head><body><p>For the reviewers that hated this movie, I truly expected to be among you.  Usually the silly comedy genre (Dumb & Dumber) just doesn't make me laugh.  Lily Tomlin & Steve Martin in "All of Me" made me laugh.  "Little Miss Sunshine" made me laugh.  I don't like disparaging humor.  In this film, Sacha Baron Cohen's anti-Jewish sentiment made me squeamish.  Then they started getting sillier like when instructing the artist to remember the horn, "It must be realistic."  By then I was laughing.  I wondered if there wasn't intended irony with the actor's last name.  Yes, this humor is very lowbrow.  It makes us ask the existential question, "Is it really okay to laugh at backward Eastern Europeans?"  But then, this is no more an accurate a representation of them than it is is of Americans.  Could a major export be pubic hair?  It's just comedy.  And I laughed SO hard, I had to sit back in my chair to not faint from laughter.  Unlike Beth Hartford Deroos' review, I did find the 300-pound naked fat man funny, particularly when they started running through the ballroom and wrestling onto the stage.  What absolute silly abandon!  Ken Davitian as Azamat does a great job.  He'll be in the "Get Smart 08" movie & has played on TV on "Six Feet Under," "Gilmore Girls" & "E.R."  Obviously, it wasn't a deep part, but it was very funny.  The DVD extras were hysterical.  Martha Stewart trying to teach Sacha how to make a bed with him getting in it and undressing.  As Martha folds the corners, he asks, "Where do you chain the womens?", as if this was a routine part of what happens in an American bed.  The scene in the animal shelter where Cohen wants to adopt a dog so he can "have sexy time" and the outrage on the animal shelter operator's face as she shoos him out of the facility is hysterical.  Cohen calling conservative black commentator Alan Keys "Chocolate face" is a humor that about only he could bring off.  "Borat" won the Best Picture Award of the American Film Institute.  Sacha Baron Cohen won Best Actor Awards from the Golden Globes, San Francisco Film Critics Circle & Utah Film Critics as well as the "Most Offensive Male Characters" Award by the Women Film Critics Circle.  This DVD did make me laugh.  It may affect you the same way!  Beware & enjoy at your own risk!</p></body></html>

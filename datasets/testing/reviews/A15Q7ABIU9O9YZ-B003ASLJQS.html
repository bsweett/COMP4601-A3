Of course we know this is not true. It wasn't true for General Rommel any more so than it was or Sean, Jimmy and Davey when at about the age of 12, Davey is kidnapped by 2 pedophiles off the apartment bordered avenue where the three friends are playing 'street hockey' where they lived in south Boston.<p>There's a remarkable scene at the end of the movie when Sean Devine, a State Police Detective, asks Jimmy Markham if he's seen Davey? Jimmy turns to Sean and says "I haven't seen Davey for 25 years, since he disappeared in that car."<p>This is a dark movie from a dark book by Dennis Lehane of the Patrick and Angie series. The book was a painful look at people, for the most part normal people or at least people we are familiar with, traumatized by an event so miniscule that it nearly goes unreported with no room on the agenda of the Rathers and the Brokaws, but sufficient enough to last a lifetime for the three boy-men.<p>In the middle of the movie Sean Penn, who is brilliant, explains how he got together wth the mother of his now murdered daughter, Katie. The mother was apparently well above the social strata of the then 19 year old Jimmy. Penn says, "I get into that car when we're kids, I'd never have the juice to ask her out."<p>Clint Eastwood does an extraordinary job just following the book. It is scary and haunting with wounded has beens acting heroic and heroes making awful mistakes. Everyone knows their part, Laurence Fisburne as Kevin Bacon''s Sergeant is excellent, Tim Robbins as the adult Dave Boyle's superior performance nearly won him a best supporting; and Sean Penn is positively the best I've ever seen.<p>The endings remain the same; perhaps there is more to the final scenes in the book as Lehane wrote it, yet Eastwood does a remarkable job in juxtaposing one scene against another. I would be astonished if after 10 years, this didn't still rank as one of the best movies of the decade. A great, haunting, disturbing, memorable, critically acclaimed movie.

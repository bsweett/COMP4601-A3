I thought that Signs was underrated and was totally surprised at the way in which the critics panned The Village--a film I found quite rewarding. Therefore, despite my hearing bad things about The Lady in the Water, I paid little attention and obtained the new release anyway. I regret to say that conventional wisdom was right in this instance because this production is terrible. The plot is contrived and it moves far too quickly to register as being compelling or believable. I found myself incapable of suspending disbelief due to tale's inherent ridiculousness. As for Bryce Dallas Howard, her presence was strong in The Village, but she's a weak sister here. It's not her fault really as the movie fails at nearly ever level, but, personally, I'm not sure she has the beauty to be a Hollywood principal actress. All of that aside, I still love Shyamalan as a director, but this one is best forgotten.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Patriotism, Faith or Fanaticism?"></head><body><p>Jeffrey Nachmanoff's "Traitor" is a tense, well-paced thriller that keeps us on the edge of our seat, at the same time aiming for our most visceral and human emotions.  It challenges us to consider the border between political and religious extremism and sincere, deeply held patriotism and faith.  I was a little surprised that Kennedy Center Honoree Steve Martin, better known for Wild and Crazy comedy, wrote the story Nachmanoff adapted into a taut screenplay.<br /><br />Don Cheadle should receive an Oscar nomination in the lead role of Samir Horn.  Samir is not a one-dimensional character and Cheadle embodies him with a focused yet larger than life performance.<br /><br />In the opening scene we see a young Samir in Sudan, in a room praying with his devout Muslim father.  Then something happens that we have no trouble understanding colors Samirs thoughts and beliefs and motivations for the rest of his life.<br /><br />We see Samir in modern times dealing sophisticated explosives to an Islamic terrorist group in Yemen.  Government agents burst in on the deal, taking Samir and the terrorists into custody.  It is implied in Yemen this involves frequent beatings and long imprisonment.<br /><br />We are introduced to a pair of FBI agents.  Max, the hot-headed one is played by Neal McDonough.  The thoughtful one, Roy Clayton, is played by Guy Pearce, who grew up in Australia but once again immerses himself in the role of an American so well I had no difficulty believing Roy is the son of a Southern Baptist Minister. (I'm the son of a Roy and a Southern Baptist myself.)  Roy is the second most important character in the film.  He became interested in Arabic culture in college, and now works for the FBI combating terrorism.  Astute and perceptive, he understands that Samir has a sincere muslim belief and is not simply interested in blowing up all things not muslim.<br /><br />We find later that Samir is deeper still.  Jeff Daniels plays Carter, a U.S. Intelligence officer, the only person alive who knows that Samir is a double agent sent to infiltrate a secret Islamic terrorist organization.<br /><br />Much of the suspense in the film is generated because Carter (and by extension the audience) doesn't know if Samir has "gone to the other side".<br /><br />Said Taghmaoui plays Omar, a member of the secret terrorist group who brings Samir into the fold, and in another fine wrinkle of the textured screenplay, we get to see many shades of gray even among the terrorists.<br /><br />The film asks difficult questions and does not imply that there are easy - or any - answers.  If you have the most sincere patriotism or faith, how many innocent people can you kill in the name of your country or faith?  Fanatics may answer "however many it takes", but Samir and Roy both have doubts, and you believe that their personal faith informs their decisions.<br /><br />This is a thoughtful thriller and if you're interested in such things - you should see it.  The Lord bless and keep you: As-Salamu `Alaikum.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="District 9"></head><body><p>`District 9' is an alien film with a difference. This is shot partly in a documentary style and follows some Aliens (nicknamed Prawns) who come to earth and who are segregated in society and who are kept in slums in Johannesburg. A government department called MNU administer and try to rehome the Prawns and this film explores what happens when one of the MNU team leaders becomes infected with an alien virus. This was slightly a slow starter, but after about twenty minutes this gathered pace and I was kept hooked until the end. The aliens aren't the explicit bad guys we have come to expect from modern films and there is real personality and a softer side to them that comes through, despite their rather unattractive exterior. This had a relatively unknown cast, who all perform well, and although the main character's South African accent can sound slightly like he is from Liverpool at times (especially when he uses the `F` word), this is the only downside to the film. The effects are pretty decent and whilst the film feels kind of low tech at the start (with the jerky documentary style camera work), by the end the effects are fairly good and the explosions and machinery are impressive. There is a lot of talk about the implicit apartheid themes to this film, and I am sure they are there, but you can just as easily watch this for a great sci-fi adventure as well. It has all the elements you would want, alien themed storyline, plenty of explosions and evil government agencies. All in all this is a good film and just over 1 hour and 40 minutes passed by in what felt like no time at all. If you enjoy sci-fi films, with an alternative view of how aliens may react when coming to earth, then check this out; I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

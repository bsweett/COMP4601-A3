<meta name="summary" content="The Best Family Musical Ever!  Still Enjoyable for Today's Audiences!"></head><body><p>When it comes to family-oriented entertainment and especially musicals, it's hard to do better than "The Sound of Music".  Not only is the plot very compelling and believable but the songs are simply inspired classics and standards that will continue to be sung many many years from now.  This represents Rodgers and Hammerstein at the top of their creative powers and this together with "Oklahoma" represent my favourite musicals of all time.<br /><br />This dvd version is the full-screen one and after viewing this a couple of times I can't help but feel that I should have gotten the widescreen version instead although as far as full-screen versions go, this is not bad.  The picture quality is well restored although not perfect as not every frame is without some form of minor defect but this is not enough to detract from your viewing enjoyment.  The sound quality is very good though coming in Dolby Digital 4.1 Surround format.  There are no Bonus features of note such as documentaries etc which is disappointing but here's hoping the upcoming Blu-ray version improves upon the picture, sound and bonus features aspects enough for us to shout about.<br /><br />As far as standard full-screen version dvds go though, this version suffices as a must have in any musical fan's dvd library although you may want to wait for the Blu-ray version if you are intending to upgrade any time soon.</p></body></html>

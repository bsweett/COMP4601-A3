<meta name="summary" content="Highly Entertaining"></head><body><p>This movie was highly entertaining though a little hard to follow.  Not being familiar with the comics, may have been the reason for my difficulties in following the plot.<p>Hellboy is found during a raid on a Nazi operation near the end of the war.  The Nazi's, with the aid of Rasputin (yes, The Rasputin from Russia)  are trying to rig a contraption and open up a rift in a type of Hell and loose demons on Earth.  The plot is foiled but the soldiers discover Hellboy.  He is brought back and raised in secret by a kind of CIA organization.<p>Years later Rasputin is back with the aid of a zombie swordsman and a reptilian creature that has numerous lives.  Rasputin's plan is to use Hellboy to continue the attempt at opening up the rift in the universe to Hell.  Great action ensues.<p>Ron Perlman actually does a convincing job as Hellboy and look for John Hurt as Hellboy's mentor.</p></body></html>

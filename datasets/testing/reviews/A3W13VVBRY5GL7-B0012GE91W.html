<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding, best HP movie to date."></head><body><p>"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" - the movie version - IS missing lots of content from its book counterpart. Also, the screenplay has wrought a lot of big changes on the book's content and chronology. If you're a book-to-film conversion purist, or a HP Book fanatic, this fact, before anything else, might well keep you from enjoying the movie to the full. That said, if you can go into this one with an open mind (and I had to force myself to do just that, HP Book fanatic that I am), you might find yourself enjoying this movie version of "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" for what it is - a fast-paced, well-made, beautiful-looking ride through Harry & co's fifth year at Hogwarts.<br /><br />The good: Acting-wise Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint keep improving, and this movie is no exception, they're very, very good in their roles. Michael Gambon is still an excellent Dumbledore and Alan RIckman's Snape is absolutely brilliant during the Occlumency scenes. It's nice to see the Dursleys back again at the start of the movie, and Harry Melling is excellent - loathsome and bullying - in his short turn as Dudley. Katie Leung is a great Cho - certainly we'll see more of her as an actress once the HP series is finished - and the rest of the cast, the heavyweights like Dame Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, David Thewlis and so forth - don't really get enough screen time to show off, but are perfectly plausible all the same.<br /><br />The newcomers are fantastic, too - Evanna Lynch makes for a great, believable Luna Lovegood and Helena Bonham-Carter's rendition of Bellatrix Lestrange is absolutely brilliant (let's hope she gets more screen-time in the "Half Blood Prince" adaptation!).<br /><br />But it's Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge who absolutely steals the show - she's brilliant. Turning on a dime from saccharine-sweet condescension to malevolent power-hungry bully, I can't imagine J.K. Rowling's original character being brought more wholly and satisfyingly to life. Okay, she may not look as much like a Toad as the book's character, but in the face of Staunton's excellent performance and faithful characterisation, that becomes immaterial. She's the best element of what must be the strongest set of performances in a HP movie to date.<br /><br />Direction by David Yates is superlative - this is a suitably adult-looking movie to reflect the changes in the HP characters' personalities and situations - and from the tense and frightening opening scenes, to the breathtaking and exciting close, Yates' talent and apparent love of this story is very palpable. Harry's "dream" sequences when Voldemort is invading his mind are brilliant - lovely to watch and very interesting from an artistic point of view - and the special effects, particularly during the closing scenes, are indescribably good.<br /><br />Production design by Stuart Craig is the absolute best in a HP movie since the original, and every element of "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", Umbridge's non-toadishness notwithstanding, is nigh-on perfect. The initial scenes at the Ministry for Magic made me sit up and go "wow!", the death eaters and dementors are more menacing than before, there's one panoramic shot of Azkaban that makes that place absolutely terrifying in its believability. No. 12 Grimmauld Place doesn't get enough air time but what's there is gold, and the character of Grawp is a lot more human and fitting than I had imagined him from the book.<br /><br />The bad elements of "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" all stem from the fact that this film's running time really is too short to capture every great aspect of the original novel, and the missing scenes will, for fans of the book, cause some distress. Also, the Malfoy-Crabbe-Goyle trinity isn't particularly worthwhile or believable, and there are a couple of montage scenes, particularly involving the Educational Decrees and Argus Filch, that feel too comic, too flimsy, to belong properly to the movie. Also, there are some overconvenient events (such as Cho and the Veritaserum, and Arthur Weasley's recovery) that could have used some rewriting to get them up to par with the rest of the screenplay.<br /><br />But that said, as a movie in its own right, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is across-the-board the most satisfying HP movie to date. Best performances, outstanding direction, excellent effects and some spectacular set and costume design have restored my faith in this series, and I for one left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Definitely a must-see for fans: newcomers; watch the others before this one - it's vital to understand what's going on. As a short adaptation of a VERY long book it works on many levels, as an entry to the movie series it's outstanding, and as a film in its own right, it's a thrilling, well-made fantasy tale that will certainly satisfy you if you don't mind the cuts.<br /><br />Highly ecommended!!</p></body></html>

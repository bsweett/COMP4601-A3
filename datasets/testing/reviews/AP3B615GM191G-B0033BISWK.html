<meta name="summary" content="Too Weird To Be Good"></head><body><p>On most occasions, I am a fan of science fiction films.  In the case of "District 9", however, the experience was just a little too bizarre to appeal to me.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the future story of human-alien interactions.  Instead of the traditional "us vs. them" battle, we have exiled them to a slum-like area where corruption breeds.  Unbeknownst to the humans, however, the aliens (Prawns) have been working on a way to go home, a method that is ultimately set in motion by a strange series of events.<br /><br />For extremely hard-core sci-fi fans, I think "D-9" will really resonate.  It is completely original, full of "future tech", and contains enough action to satisfy the "shoot 'em up" crowd.  In an age of sequels and recycled plots, I have to give the creators credit for thinking up such out-there stuff.<br /><br />From a "regular movie" standpoint, though, "D-9" is just too fractured and strange to be considered a success.  Besides the main character (and even so much more could have been done with him), this is a typical "black and white" film.  The bad guys are mustache-twirling fiends, while the good guys are portrayed as innocent of everything.  I call this the "Avatar Effect", and prefer a bit more ambiguity ("shades of grey") in the character development.  Plus, just when (at times) you think the plot is really heating up, it usually gets bogged down in more laser blasts and military action.<br /><br />Thus, while not a terrible movie by any means, "D-9" was just too strange and ultimately formulaic for this reviewer.  If you appreciate "left field" ideas, however, then you will like it more than I.  2.5 stars would be a more accurate rating, but I couldn't give it the benefit of the doubt for 3.</p></body></html>

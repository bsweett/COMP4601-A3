<meta name="summary" content=""Who's Laughing NOW?!?!?!?""></head><body><p>When I first saw Evil Dead II on opening night of it's original theatrical release, I was horrified to see that Director Sam Raimi had turned his back on my beloved horror genre, and made a bizarre splatter-slapstick movie, or what star Bruce<br />"Ash" Campbell would later call "Splatstick". I spent the whole running time fuming over this betrayal. How could the man behind the awesome Evil Dead make this travesty?<p>  Well, with 15 years hindsight under my belt, I am now able to appreciate Evil Dead II for what it is: An over-the-top, out-of-control romp that keeps the blood gushing and the belly laughs coming from start to finish. <p>  After a brief recap of the first Dead flick, we have a new batch of victims come to the cabin to be menaced (along with the leftover Ash...) by the "deadites". Much carnage ensues.....<p>  The effects are great, and it's amazing to see what the filmmakers were able to accomplish with such a limited budget.<br />The extras are a lot of fun, too. The commentary with Campbell & Raimi is hilarious and enlightening, and the featurette, "The Gore The Merrier" is must-see for deadheads. There's also a couple of still galleries, the theatrical trailer, and your choice of Widescreen or full-frame. (Pick widescreen!)<p>  As Ash would say, "Come get some!"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>Definitely a great epic movie, Master and Commander: The Far side of the World, brings to the screen the story of "Lucky Jack" Aubrey, captain of the HMS Surprise, as it hunts down the Acheron, a French privateer.<br /><br />Their quest takes them from the coast of Brazil across the treacherous waters off tip of South America to the Galapagos Isles in the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />The film combines action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in sea bound adventures after a long dormant period.<br /><br />Russell Crowe, Billy Boyd, and Paul Bettany, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding, making this movie one of the best of its kind. The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!<br /><br />Ships, Battles, and swordfights are all about.<br /><br />In short, it is a movie worth watching!</p></body></html>

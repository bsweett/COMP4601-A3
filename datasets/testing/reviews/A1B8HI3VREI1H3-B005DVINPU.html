<meta name="summary" content="Batman(1989)"></head><body><p>The campy, 1960's Batman TV show starring Adam West and Burt Ward hurt Batman's image. Words such as "pow" and "zap" were synonymous with Batman. Director Tim Burton and executive producers Michael E. Uslan and Benjamin Melniker were determined to make a dark, gothic, nightmarish Batman movie. Zorro movies, 1930's movie serials, and Da Vinci artwork may have inspired Bob Kane to create Batman. Tim Burton's Batman was a critical and commercial hit! I can remember boys, girls, men, and women wearing Batman T-shirts. I can remember a kid with a Batman insignia haircut! The Heroic Trio(1992, Dong Fong Saam Hap)borrows visuals from Batman(1989). Michael Keaton gives a sincere performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Before the film was made, people didn't want "Mr. Mom" playing Batman. Jack Nicholson steals the show as The Joker. Kim Basinger is quite good as Vicky Vale, the film's heroine. Although, she does a lot of screaming! The late Michael Gough gives a sincere performance as Alfred, Batman's butler. Pat Hingle is quite good as Commissioner Gordon. Prince wrote some songs for Batman. Tracey Walter is good as Bob, The Joker's lackey. Bob had his own Batman action figure!<br /> In Batman(1989), Batman/Bruce Wayne must stop The Joker from killing off Gotham City's citizens with chemical weapons. Batman and The Joker are also smitten with Vicky Vale. Danny Elfman's Batman music score is excellent and it's aged better than the songs in the movie. Billy Dee Williams is quite good as Harvey Dent. Too bad he didn't get a chance to play Dent in Batman Forever(1995). As Siskel and Ebert pointed out, there's a sense of dread running through Batman(1989). In Batman(1989), Gotham City is covered in grime and filth. In Batman Forever(1995), Gotham City has a bright, neon-colored, Las Vegas look!<br />There were not one, but two video games based on Batman(1989). There was Batman: Return of the Joker on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Batman(1989) still is awesome!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="devilishly cute and very fashionably wicked....."></head><body><p>I will be the first to admit to you, here and now, that I have never owned anything from Calvin Klein, Vera Wang, Jimmy Choo, or Tommy Hilfiger (much less Abercrombie & Fitch).  Yes, Amazon.com readers, I am not a fashion maven.  To be honest with you, most of the fashion references in this film (made by the delightfully wicked Meryl Streep, as Miranda Priestly) went right over my head.  Yet, it worked.  Can you blame poor Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) for feeling more than a little beside herself?  I mean, the girl comes straight out of a good college with a journalism degree, with the aspiration of one day working for the New York Times, and must take an administrative position in a fashion firm (fashion being a subject she knows NOTHING about).<br /><br />Others before me have called this film a--sort of--modern day Cinderella story with a twist.  For me, it was more like a comment on modern day materialism, ambition, and how we all have the option in life to throw our morality to the wayside in persuit of the "American Dream."  This was more social commentary, to me, than anything else.<br /><br />Is this worth seeing?  Yes, I think it is.  Anne Hathaway is absolutely charming as the heroine, Meryl Streep steals the show with her one liners and posturing, and you can tell the whole cast was having great fun with her.</p></body></html>

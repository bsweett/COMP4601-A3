<meta name="summary" content="Never underestimate an Irishman"></head><body><p>When I first saw the previews for "Cinderella Man", I wrote it out off as another "Rocky" with a more detailed historical setting.  Needless to say, I was very, very wrong.  Ron Howard is not a favorite director of mine, but he pulled it off here in spades.<br /><br />Having known only a little bit about James J. Braddock, one time Heavyweight Champion of the World and, like the unfortunate Primo Carnera before him, the first member of his particular ethnic group to win that honor, I was aware of him only as the first Irish Heavyweight Champion of the World.  They call every upset in boxing "the greatest upset in boxing history", so I wrote that one off too.  Again, I was wrong.<br /><br />Russell Crowe does a phenomenal job of playing this humble man who, when asked by the press why he fights so passionately, replies simply:"Milk".<br />Jim Braddock was not obsessed with boxing, nor was he determined to make<br />it his life's vocation: he simply loved his family and his wife, and for<br />them he was willing to take the hardest punches from some of the strongest and most ambitious contenders of his era. At this time (perhaps because of the stress of the Depression and the aimless bloodlust that ensued in most Americans), boxing was more popular than baseball and was the nation's sport.<br /><br />In the beginning of the film we see Braddock, a savvy businessman and an up and coming fighter doing very well for himself, like everyone was in those days.  He has a dedicated trainer, Joe Gould, played by Paul Giamatti.  Giamatti does a good job of portraying the fiery, all New-York manager who could talk his way into some of the most astonishing business deals and who rivalled Don King in his ability to make spectacular fights happen.  The amount of somehow good natured obscenities that run from this guy's mouth from the beginning to the end of this film only endear him more to the viewer for some peculiar reason.<br /><br />But when the Depression hits, James Braddock is just like any other man and, when things get so tight that his wife, the fantastic Renee Zellweger, has to scrounge around for pieces of wood to burn just to keep the house warm and put water in the milk because her credit is gone at the local grocery store, he works on the docks with everyone else.  Having broken his hand in three places, his response to his wife's idea for relief is to have her paint his hand black with shoe polish, to make it look like a minor burn.  He works on the docks with other men, and befriends a particularly angry man who, despite his love for his family, is determined to organize some kind of workers' strike.  In one of the most piercing scenes in the film, Braddock searches for his friend and finds him dead the shacks in Central Park.<br /><br />Braddock is all grit and good will, not even allowing his child to steal from the butcher when they are practically starving; when he finally does have to apply for government relief, his pride is so wounded that he is willing to enter the ring again as an absolute nobody, a washed up has been that everyone laughs at.  At no point is any of this saccharine or unrealistic; all the ugly emotions and the miserable chaos of poverty are shown without pulling any punches.<br /><br />His begging days are over. In an unbelievable and painful comeback, Braddock defeats the number two contender for the heavyweight crown.  Howard does a great job during the brutal fight scenes of his family running through his mind, rendering surrender impossible.  This leads, of course, to his legendary bout with the fierce Max Baer.  The film turned me off a little bit here: they completely misrepresent Baer from the beginning to the end. Portrayed as some abusive, amoral thug who seems proud of having killed two men in the ring, Craig Bierko looks like an unshaven Brendan Frazier straight of out "George of the Jungle" trying to seem scary.  Here Howard becomes unethical and downright villainous in his attempt to produce a cardboard  bad guy: Baer killed Frankie Campbell and another man in the ring, yes, and was psychologically traumatized by it.  His son, Max Baer Jr., has repeatedly stated that his father often woke up screaming at night, visions of these accidental deaths flashing through his mind. He paid for Campbell's son to go to college and never had the same killer instinct afterward.  Baer appeared in "The Harder They Fall", a famous cinematic condemnation of the sport and said several times that he hated boxing and wanted to be an actor.<br /><br />Anyway, Crowe does a fantastic job of depicting a man who had nothing and, through his own willpower and determination, rose back to the top in a dangerous sport all for the welfare of his family.  Braddock becoming World Champion is indeed the greatest boxing upset in history, I discovered after researching it a little bit: the only thing that comes close to it is the defeat of Mike Tyson by James Buster Douglas, and that had far more mitigating circumstances behind it than this fight.  All feel good BS aside, James Braddock is and always will be a hero of conscience for the American public.  A touching film.</p></body></html>

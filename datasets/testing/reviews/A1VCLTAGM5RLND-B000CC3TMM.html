I never thought it'd be as good as it was. Almost as if you combind James Bond and an old school Jackie Chan movie into one hell of an action exciting film! The phenomenal yet totally off the wall action stunts got me right into the movie. It's definitely Jason Statham's movie that will make well known like Arnold Swarzenegger. Jason Statham will become the next action star.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny and Entertaining for Adults"></head><body><p>This movie is well cast and well acted; the cast headed up by Jack Nicholson, Keanu Reeves, and Diane Keaton does a splendid job which permits the viewer to develop a concern for the characters and a desire that all will work out well for each of them.<br /><br />There are a lot of laughs as well as touching situations to which many will be able to relate. The movie is well paced and seems to go by quickly. There is beautiful scenery which always contributes to the enjoyment of the movie.<br /><br />Although funny and entertaining for mature adults I can in no wise recommend this movie for the entire family. It presents ideas and situations which are not suitable for children and does not promote high moral values.</p></body></html>

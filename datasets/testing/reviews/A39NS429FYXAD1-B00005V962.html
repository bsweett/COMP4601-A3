<meta name="summary" content="One of film's all time best crime capers!"></head><body><p>This is fun from beginning to end...clever, fun, fast and funny.  Every component is there: from the direction and writing, to casting and editing....incredible score, effects and production values.  In spite of the fact that it's about a huge robbery, it manages to be entertainment devoid of Hollywood-style violence and profanity.  A true blockbuster!<br /><br />This bargain DVD includes two great, warts n' all commentary tracks: one smart ass track with Soderbergh and Griffin, the other with 3 of its stars (Damon proves again that he's the smartest, most savvy of today's underestimated film hunks).<br /><br />You won't care that Don Cheadle's dialect coach was overpaid or that, for all her glamour, Julia Roberts still has difficulty walking in high heels...you will love this great movie, again and again!</p></body></html>

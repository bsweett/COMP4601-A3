<meta name="summary" content="LIGHT-HEARTED GLIMPSE OF SERIOUS, UNIVERSAL THEMES"></head><body><p>While I don't proclaim the Breakfast Club to be a masterpiece or &quot;the best movie ever&quot; or anything quite as seminal as that, it certainly deserves appreciation for its originality. <p>Here was a film that presents five students who initially come across as cardboard cliches, but who eventually reveal themselves as so much more. The writing is sharp and crisp, and apart from a few patches of overdone juvenile behavior, the dialogue flows seamlessly. <p>Sure, the movie has its warts. Parents are the root of all the kids' problems; there are annoying lapses in logic (like how does Ringwald get to see Nelson at the end and Sheedys character wasn't assigned detention, so wouldn't Gleason know that) and there is a somewhat prolonged but inconsequential dance sequence smooshed in.<p>Yet, twenty two years on, the movie still rings as true as ever because school life remains essentially the same -- same sorts of conflict between generations, private fears often undisclosed to the outside world, worries about their futures nagging them, etc etc. <p>A truly enjoyable, clever brat-pack character study. Special highlight -- the popular Simple Minds number &quot;Don't You Forget About Me&quot;.</p></body></html>

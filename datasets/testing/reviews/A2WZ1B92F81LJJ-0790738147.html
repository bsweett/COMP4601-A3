<meta name="summary" content="Rip-snorter."></head><body><p>Until this film hit the silver screen, James Ellroy's books were famously (and quite understandably) considered to be unfilmable: they're so epic in scope and byzantine in plot they would make filming a Tolkien trilogy seem like a doddle. <p>But records and rules were made to be broken, and this film version of Ellroy's LA Confidential shatters that conventional wisdom and brings Ellroy's vision vivdly to the screen.<p>It's a top-notch cast into the bargain; while headlines may go to Bassinger as femme fatale, Pearce and Crowe and rookie cops at the centre of the maelstrom, make sure you keep an eye on the surrounding cast - to my mind this is really what gives the film its zip and zing. James Cromwell - yes, the kindly farmer from Babe - avoids the danger of being typecast in that role, to say the least, as a truly dastardly police commander; Kevin Spacey is all satin and schwing as the smooth-talking celebrity cop Jack Vincennes, but crowning the whole shooting match (a term I use deliberately), and more than anything infusing the movie with Ellroy's hipster '50s attitude and credibility is none other than Danny de Vito, having the time of his life as the editor of Hush Hush Magazine.<p>This is a really, really slick show, from beginning to end. Where Curtis Hanson has been especially canny is in paring down some of the excesses of Ellroy's plotting (it has always struck me as odd that a writer with such a deliberately sparse, stacatto, writing style gets so carried away with his plots) so as not to tax credulity or the "Oh Come On" factor, and has landed up with a tense, riveting, brutal, but at the same time knowing and witty, thriller.<p>This is a must for any fan of modern cinema.</p></body></html>

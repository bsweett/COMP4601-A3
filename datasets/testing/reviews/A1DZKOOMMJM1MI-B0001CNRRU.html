The story is better left in summary:  A freak accident brings together a critically ill mathematician (Sean Penn), a grieving mother (Naomi Watts) and a born-again ex-con (Benincio Del Toro). In itself, it provides an upfront guarantee of satisfaction and weaves a spellbinding and suspenseful mystery. However, after throwing in its credited cast and their flawless performances, you get one of the most powerful films of the year. The wonderful Sean Penn leads the all-star cast, who all deliver possibly the finest performances of their careers. Guillermo Arriaga writes this intelligent story with the intent to captivate his audience, which he does, and at the same time touch them, which he also does. The film is greatly benefited from the award-nominated acting and the superb direction. Though the film blasts back and forth from past to present, by the movie's end every scene has been tied to the next leaving no questions -- nothing but a speechless audience. 21 Grams is a profound piece of cinematic art and is highly recommended. This is a superb drama and one not to be missed.</p></body></html>

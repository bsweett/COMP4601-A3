<meta name="summary" content="riveting and compelling (4.7/10)"></head><body><p>my roommate and i both enjoyed this film on the life of Wolfgang<br />Amadeus Mozart.it's basically told from the perspective of Antonio<br />Salieri(F. Murray Abraham).the movie may or may not be historically<br />accurate,but so what.it isn't a documentary.it's a Hollywood film,so of<br />course dramatic liberties have been taken.the point is,it is a<br />beautiful looking film.the music is superb.the acting is first rate.the<br />costumes are exquisite.the tension is at times palpable and there is<br />comic relief.Tom Hulce doesn't get a lot of recognition as an actor,but<br />he is certainly brilliant here as Mozart.Jeffrey Jones has a great turn<br />as well,as Emperor Joseph II.Roy Dotrice is also a standout as Mozart's<br />Father Leopold.all told,this a remarkable achievement. 4.7/10</p></body></html>

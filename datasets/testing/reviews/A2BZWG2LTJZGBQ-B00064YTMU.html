<meta name="summary" content="Another excellent effort from Michael Mann"></head><body><p>I hope all those who make films choose to see this movie at some time in the near future.  If they do, they will see the essence of great filmmaking.  Is this the best film ever made?  No, not by a longshot.  But it does display the things that great movies have- things that are mostly lacking from the lackluster efforts most producers subject us to these days.  Instead of giving us a bunch of special effects for no reason, this film chooses to give us characters we can sink our teeth into with an intense setting and premise we have not seen often.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver whose "part time" job behind the wheel has lasted 12 years.  After giving a ride to a beautiful lady, he gets a new fare, a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who basically hires him for the night to drive him around town for 600 dollars.  As you probably know by now, the stops are for kills, as Vincent is a contract killer.  The internal struggle for Foxx is how to deal with this situation as well as the other problems that arise.  Director Michael Mann once again chooses a great cast to carry his film.  Both Cruise and Foxx are splendid.  They are complex characters, as we learn much about each of them during the course of the film.  The storyline is really nothing special.<br /><br />But it doesn't have to be.  The mistake directors and producers make these days is to focus on the plot of the movie instead of the characters and their development.  This leads to wooden dialogue and people we can't wait to get away from.  Alfred Hitchcock always said that too many filmmakers focused on the "MacGuffin" instead of the characters (Hitchcock defined this as that part of the plot that all the characters are trying to solve, but the audience doesn't care in the least) and that is usually the case.  Great films are always great because of the characters and their development.  This is a film which understands that and is not only very intense, but truly enjoyable.  I highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

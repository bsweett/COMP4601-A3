Not being a parent, I have a problem listening to smug teenagers who think they are wise beyong their years. The smug attitude of the young girls turned me off as a person looking in from the outside, but once the movie gets going and the characters are fleshed out, I enjoyed this quirkly little film and the excellent cast. The story is real and everything rings true. It's a film well worth your time and money. The single disc version is very good with an excellent transfer and some interesting extra material.</p></body></html>

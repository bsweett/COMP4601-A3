<meta name="summary" content="Casino"></head><body><p>Casino is clever, witty, styilish and its a true story. Casino is a fact based mob movie that stars Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone and James Woods. Casino is one of the best mob movies of all time. DeNiro, Pesci and Stone deliver Oscar worthy performances. The movie is a must see. Casino is an emotional movie and it delivers a strong message. Casino is also not a movie for everone. People who enjoy true srories, mob movies and people who want to adventure into the harsh world of sex, money, drugs and corruption through a movie screen should definetly get off their tails and BUY, or at least RENT this film.</p></body></html>

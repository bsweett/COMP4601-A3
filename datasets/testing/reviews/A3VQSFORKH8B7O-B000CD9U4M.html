<meta name="summary" content="GOOD, BUT OVERLY BURTON-ESQUE!"></head><body><p>From the opening scenes of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," I expected to see Michael Keaton in the batsuit pop out at any moment. For, make no mistake, Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic novel, is very "Burton-esque." The crazy visuals and wacky characters abound. Depp's performance is kinda rediculous, though there are moments where he's funny. The kids, however, are very good. They are the star of the film, in my opinion. Freddie Highmore gives the best performance of the film as Charlie, and his portrayal of the character is the only thing that is better than "Willie Wonka," as he doesn't whine and complain like Peter Ostrum.<br /><br />The funniest scene in the movie is the TV-Room. If you, like me, are a fan of "2001: A Space Odyssey," then you'll be dying lauging at this part.<br /><br />Despite Burton's freaky visual style and Depp's ludicrous performance, kids and parents will find much to appreciate in this film. But I still recommend "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" over this one.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Why was there never a sequel?"></head><body><p>This movie was little more than your typical 80's "Teen angst" movie, starring Sean Astin, Josh Brolin and (we hope) a sober and drug free Corey Feldman. A search for pirate treasure, a trio of bad guys who keep their deformed brother locked in a basement and an Indiana Jones-like trek through tunnels, caves and booby traps takes this from a campy 80's kid flick to an enjoyable Richard Donner film.<br /><br />I just watched it again this past weekend with my 9 year old. He sat wide-eyed at the tense parts, laughed his toosh off at the funny parts and raised a freaked out brow at the first sighting of Sloth...<br /><br />And when it was all over, he asked me a very simple question... "When's part two coming out?"<br /><br />I didn't know what to tell him. After 20 years, if they haven't made one by now, they're not likely to make one. "Chunk" at 35 just wouldn't be as funny.</p></body></html>

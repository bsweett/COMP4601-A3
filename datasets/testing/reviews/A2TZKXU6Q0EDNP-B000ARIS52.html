<meta name="summary" content="Newsflash: A comic's comic , a film's a film..."></head><body><p>Not surprisingly most of the rumours circulating about this film (as it is with most films for that matter) were inaccurate. Not all, but most.<br /><br />It was supposed to be ultraviolent to the point where it could disturb some viewers. Not the case. Aside of one single scene everything else we've seen before on this violence level. In fact, to me this film worked more as a very dark comedy than anything else.<br /><br />Then again it turned out being very close to an art-noir film, something not included in all the talk before the film was released. It has all the characteristics of being artsy: clever and intriguing use of color, surreal city-scapes etc.<br /><br />Where it falters is (again not surprisingly) in character development. Keeping in mind that it's based on a comic, we should rememebr that when one reads a comic he builds the characters himself. You tend to attribute traits to characters as you read a comic or a book because your imagination plays a much more active role compared to watching a film. It's the difference of the medium that dictates this.<br /><br />In Sin City most of the characters are shallow with the exception of Bruce Willis who's given unequally more depth than the rest. At some point it all gets too close to a very stylistic but smallminded slug fest where body parts are flying away , various characters are blasted to smithereens, chopped or gunned down.<br /><br />But still the film works, mainly because of its unique premise that there's no hero on the good side involved. Everyone in Sin City is a doomy shady character, every relationship has a strong dark side, every mission has evil intentions, the whole city lives and breathes under dim ominous lights. That's the biggest success of the director and his crew, that they managed to bring acroos this atmosphere very convincingly indeed while delivering it with an artistic overtone.<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings, Sin City is worth watching and if the other rumours are true (i.e the creators planning to turn this into a long lasting movie series) it's obviously bound for commercial success as well.<br /><br />But having spoken of very dark comedy, the very first 40 minutes where Mickey Rourke is involved are gonna draw some serious laughs from those with a more flexible sense of humor. This is a character where the word "unsubtle" applies with a vengeance.<br /><br />As far as Rodriguez is concerned Sin City is easily an improvement over Once Upon A Time In Mexico. There could be further development from him to see.</p></body></html>

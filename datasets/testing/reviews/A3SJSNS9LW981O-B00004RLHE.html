<meta name="summary" content="The difinitive version!"></head><body><p>An obsessed, ordinary man... his skeptical wife, his new neighbor friend, and the mega forces of a government and scientific community who seek to shield him from knowing the truth!<br /><br />Add to the mix a stirring soundtrack, top notch effects, a little humor here and there, a horrific abduction scene, and a consistent atmosphere of intrigue and mystery...<br /><br />The ending does seem a bit overdone and sentimental, but this movie is simply one of the best ever made. It set the standard for future filmmaking.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "The Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

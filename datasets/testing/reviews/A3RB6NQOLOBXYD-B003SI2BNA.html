<meta name="summary" content="Although Jennifer Connelly is beautiful and her acting is stunning...she fails to save the film"></head><body><p>Now I have not seen the Japanese version of Darkwater, but this American remake is pretty stale. Jennifer Connelly is a middle aged woman struggling through custody battles with her husband over their daughter Ceci. She starts a new life with her daughter in Roosevelt Island right outside Manhattan, the apartment they move into is old and extremely creepy. Leaks and strange noises are just some of the common problems Jennifer Connelly and her daughter encounter. Now in the opening scene of the movie we see Jennifer Connelly as a young girl waiting for her mother to pick her up from school. Unfortunately her mother forgets about her and she is left to wait with her teacher. Now this scene kinda explains why their new apartment is dripping with "dark water". Later on we are introduced with the caretaker of the building, he is impolite and very rude. Up above Jennifer Connelly's room was a Russian family with a single daughter also. The two parents assumed that one of them took their daughter with them, we later find out that the father split and went to live with his mother in Russia and the mother ran away. Ceci all of a sudden has trouble adjusting to her new school and talks to an imaginary friend named Natasha, (Russian girl). Ceci begins to know about Jennifer Connelly's poor relationship with her mother. We later find out that the Young abandoned Russian girl died on the rooftop and thats why Jennifer Connelly experienced nightmares and hallucinations. The care taker of the building was aware of this death but covered it up saying she was still alive. He just didn't want to let the cops investigate on this tragic death of the young girl. Tim Roth plays Jennifer Connelly's lawyer who helps her gain custody of Ceci and repair the apartment damages. Now the whole point of this ghost story is that the young Russian girl and Jennifer Connelly both had irresponsible mothers. In other words this ghost story pretty much goes unexplained, not too mention there really isn't any "jump out of your seat scenes" althought there is a scene where Jennifer Connelly is wet in a white t-shirt. The movie is well paced and the acting is pretty decent but the whole story line is pretty poor and fails to capture any real suspense. In the long run, this deff. a rentable movie, don't buy it like I did unless your a die hard Jennifer Connelly fan.</p></body></html>

If &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em> had been directed by anyone other than Ridley Scott, or if it hadn't been marketed as an &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> prequel--I am working on the hypothesis that it originally was not, and the &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> elements were retrofitted either at the insistence of the studio or when Scott and Spaits/Lindelof realized how much there was in common there--we wouldn't be having any of the discussions we are currently having about this movie. We'd probably be pretty united in hailing it as one of the more inventive (if derivative), and certainly one of the most technically accomplished, science fiction movies in recent memory, probably the best sci-fi movie since &lt;em>Cube&lt;/em> almost fifteen years ago. From a technical standpoint, &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em> is unassailable; the acting is pitch-perfect, the direction is exactly what one would expect form the guy who brought you &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Bladerunner&lt;/em>, every member of the crew brought his or her A game, the 3D is hands-down the best I've seen since &lt;em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams&lt;/em> (and is used much in the same way, to my delight). In short, this is the type of movie for which the word "sumptuous" was coined. Forget all that Merchant-Ivory boondoggle. (After all, what are sci-fi films if not period dramas for periods that haven't happened yet?) It is, in short, an impressive achievement by any empirical yardstick one would choose to measure it with.<br /><br />The problem is, of course, that it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> directed by Ridley Scott, and even if you hadn't caught all the in-jokes and references in the script before you hit the final sequence, well, when you get to that point there's no denying this is an &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> movie. (And in a movie that seemed awfully retrofitted, that final sequence was the most garishly tacked-on bit. But I am getting ahead of myself.) Now, while I am a pretty darned big fan of the Alien series, or at least the first three movies (I still to this day have not gotten round to seeing &lt;em>Alien Resurrection&lt;/em>, despite pretty much everyone I know telling me how much better it is than &lt;em>Alien&lt;supr>3&lt;/supr>&lt;/em>, a movie I actually quite liked), and even the one guy in the room who actually enjoyed &lt;em>Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em> for the stupid fun fanboy movie it was, I'm still a casual fan of the series as opposed to a true &lt;em>otaku&lt;/em>. You kind of have to be, in order to enjoy the big stuff-blows-up stupidity of &lt;em>Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em> in any way.<br /><br />There's also another layer to this, and one that most people don't seem to have thought about, but that's come up a few times in my discussions on the movie since I saw it Friday night (I'm writing this on the following Monday afternoon); there's a meta layer that was absent from the other films. And perhaps I'm overstepping the bounds here, but it seems to me that Scott and co., and specifically Avy Kaufman, who cast Noomi Rapace as a character named Elizabeth (and in at least one place during an action scene, an actor slips up and calls her character Lisbet), pretty much invited this meta layer into the film. And it casts an interesting light on what has become one of the movie's big controversies. But again, I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />NOTE: There is one thing revealed in the synopsis that I can't believe is a spoiler, though there is a scene in the film that leads me to believe it was meant that way. If you are especially spoiler-sensitive, you may want to skip over the synopsis.<br /><br />Plot: two sceintists, Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace, rocketed to fame through playing Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (&lt;em>Devil&lt;/em>'s Logan Marshall-Green), uncover what would seem to be a star map in the cave paintings and stone carvings of half a dozen, maybe more, ancient civilizations. Thanks to new-and-improved 2089 technology, they pinpoint the exact star system those paintings depict.<br /><br />[Problem #1: 35,000+ years later, the positions of some of those stars will have changed; after a tenth of that, some of the Greek constellations have lost their original shapes to modern eyes.]<br /><br />So Weyland Technologies, headed up by the very, very old Peter Weyland (&lt;em>The Adventures of Priscilla&lt;/em>'s Guy Pearce, and I'd be tempted to ask him which film had the tougher make-up job) and his ice-queen daughter Meredith Vickers (&lt;em>Monster&lt;/em>'s Charlize Theron), send a ship out to this star system, which happens to contain one very earth-like moon revolving a Saturn-like planet. The ship contains seventeen crew members, including various scientists, navigators, Vickers as the Weyland Technologies representative, and an android named David (&lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>'s Michael Fassbender) who learns human mannerisms from watching old movies obsessively, but, as a hologram of Weyland reminds us during the mission briefing, has no soul. Holloway and Shaw believe this planet to be the home of a race they call the Engineers--advanced beings who created the human race. When they get to the planet they do indeed find evidence that something other than nature has been there ("God does not create in straight lines," as Holloway tells us), but of course, what they are seeking and what they find are two entirely different things...<br /><br />As regards the meta I spoke of earlier, and its particular application to &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em>: Michael Fassbender garnered a great deal of critical acclaim for his role in &lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>, playing a sex addict. An interesting choice to play the role of an asexual robot, especially when so many of your audience members leave asking themselves (or the people they were with) "was David gay?". It's a frankly ridiculous question to even be asking, and while half of me doubts that 90%+ of the people involved in the debate are even aware &lt;em>Shame&lt;/em> exists, it still feels like that particular casting choice forced the issue, rather like not changing the name of Noomi Rapace's character. And I've been mulling on this for days without being able to come up with another motive than "provide non-controversy to get butts in seats." Which seems to be working, but it feels a little disingenuous.<br /><br />But you know what else? I'm going to ask you to forget all that. I'm also going to ask you to forget about all those plot holes that aren't really plot holes (if you're watching the movie on DVD, pause it when they reveal the designation of the planet, then go back and watch the first &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em>; they're two different, albeit somehow related, planets), forget about the anachronisms that make this ship so much technologically cooler (despite predating it) than the Nostromo, forget this movie is in any way related to the Alien franchise, which it actually &lt;em>is&lt;/em> possible to do until you get to that last sequence that drove me up the wall. Instead, focus on the other obvious source material from which they drew when writing this script: &lt;em>2001&lt;/em>. All the stuff about exploration and the dawn of man and all that. That, to me, is where the core of this film lay: in the sense of wonder at the discoveries they were making. &lt;em>That&lt;/em> is what this movie was about, and in that, it succeeded as well as it could given the script tinkering and retrofitting and all the other silliness. All of which means this is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is a lovely one, and worth seeing. *** ?</p></body></html>

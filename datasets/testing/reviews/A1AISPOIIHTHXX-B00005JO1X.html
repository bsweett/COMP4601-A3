I remember reading the books in one setting and I actually forgot the story to practically all of them. Call it being rushed or just forgetfulness but re-experiencing the story of this one made me like the book even more since it's quite a story anyway you slice it.<br /><br />The Pevensie children are relocated during WW2 and they're sent to live with someone. While playing a game of hide and seek, Lucy the youngest stumbles upon a wardrobe closet. Instead of finding the back of it, she finds Narnia, a magical land with talking animals. Afterwards, she brings in her other siblings, Peter, Susan and Edmund and actually get caught up in a war: Narnians versus those loyal to the evil White Witch. And helping them out is the almighty lion Aslan.<br /><br />It's hard to describe Narnia(or Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter for that matter) without saying stuff like almighty, magical and whatnot but the nice thing about the film is that it doesn't over explain too much. One problem I had with Tolkien books was he explained EVERYTHING, even minor characters got backstories, even swords. Do we care how a magical land exists in a wardrobe closet? I don't so it's great that you just go along with it. There is one big of explaining on a resurrection but that's ok, didn't phase me much.<br /><br />Earlier this year King Kong won for Best Visual Effects which honestly I don't understand, there were composition problems all over the place like they were nearly finished but put in the finished film. Narnia has the same problem but not as extreme. Some shots are actually very well done while other shots are very funky looking(usually involving talking animals). Weta in many respects as a long way to go before they achieve quality shots. ILM has gone past the realm of "obvious CG shots" and Weta is catching up. The better of the 2 in the long run, I got no idea.<br /><br />Acting-wise some have issues with it but I found it pretty solid, especially Georgie Henley as the young Lucy. The other 3 are good but they're not really scene stealers or standouts. Tilda Swilton is of course a perfect White Witch, being over-the-top villainy and relishing in it. And just like Star Wars and Batman Begins and Kingdom of Heaven, Liam Neeson plays Aslan, the all-knowing calm teacheresque lion. Wonder if he'll ever NOT do any father figure roles in the future?<br /><br />It's obvious we're going to get another, and possibly the other 5(apparently Prince Caspian is next) and so far it's a pretty solid entry to the series.</p></body></html>

But what's difficult to transfer to the film is the actual excess of style.  For instance, in the book you can note the actual style in which the book is structured.  There are entire chapters that, by the style they're done in and the placement they're given, tell the reader that they are non-essential.  The rants on Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the News--these run 5-6 pages in the book and are best skipped.  (Though if you go through them you find some great lines.)  In a film it's difficult to do that because they would equate to 5 more minutes on the running time and a bored audience.  <p>Anyway, onto the film.  I thought American Psycho was as good an adaptation as anyone could hope for if they're a fan of the book.  Mary Harron (a female director making the ultimate movie about "men behaving badly" as she puts it in the featurette) does two things: she makes the film a real treat for those who read the book, and she makes the film funny and witty enough for those just wondering what the fuss is.  Plenty of people will figure out what the book must have been like once they see the movie.<p>I don't where to start except to say you owe it yourself to see this excellent independent film.  ...  Christian Bale is amazing as Patrick Bateman.  The accent is great, the facial expressions priceless (that look he gets when examining a rival's business card), the whole play he does on the character.  It looks like everyone gets what Ellis was doing with the book.  Everyone may hear about the notoriety of the book, but in the end American Psycho was the blackest of comedies, forcing the reader to try and laugh at moments that are interspersed with some of the most disturbing passages I've read in a long time.  <p>The filmmakers do an incredible and difficult job of cutting the book down to filmable size.  It's a great job of picking scenes from the book for the screen, meanwhile leaving out entire sections and characters (Bethanie, his ex-girlfriend) but not compromising the whole thing.  This could be a 3 hour movie, instead it's under 100 minutes and feels just right.  <p>Christian Bale is so commanding as Bateman that he gives a real face to the narrator of the book.  The film even keeps some of the violence, but watching those scenes from the book played off they take on a humerous tone that the black and white page was hiding well.  For instance, the murder of Al, the bum, becomes funny when Bateman starts saying those lines.  The film is not a comedy, it's a not horror movie, it's not a drama.  It's a very vicious satire that combines all of those elements and stays smart.  <p>I don't see a more famous Hollywood or not-Hollywood director making this without compromising more of the book in favor of personal style.  <p>Interesting to note: For some reason the UK region DVD (which you can't play over here) has 6 deleted scenes!  The American DVD has a number of nice extras, but why would they leave off the deleted scenes?  Sure, they're cutting room floor, but at least 2 of the scenes would have fit nicely into the film, and the other bits are funny as well.  ... <p>This is a highly recommended film for anyone with a little dark side, no matter how little.  It's funny and visually provoking enough for many people to fall in love with this small production and appreciate cruel satire and the blackest humor.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Vampires Don't Suck This Time"></head><body><p>I'll admit that I went into this film expecting just another stupid vampire film.  Like zombies in video games, every big film these days just has to have vampires and it's all thanks to Twilight and Friends.  It has become the comedy staple of many satires (including the horribly made Vampires Suck) and online parodies that makes any member of the general audience just roll their eyes when they hear about a film coming out about vampires.  Because of this established norm, my friends and I scheduled a movie night hoping to heckle or "riff" the hell out of Let Me In just like we had done with Sharktopus the week prior.<br /><br />When the credits rolled and we all looked at each other, we made the startling observation that we had not really done any riffing at all.  We got a few jabs in early on during the opening scene in the hospital (they were Dirty Harry references BTW), but they quickly began to trail off as the film went on.  We began to get drawn into the film and soon the entire audience, myself included, just watched the film intently.  We enjoyed it, thoroughly and couldn't believe what had just transpired.<br /><br />The film has a very basic premise, forbidden love between a bullied preteen kid and a girl vampire (this ISN'T a spoiler as it's written in the description and on the back of the box).  It kinda reminds me of any Disney film pertaining to forbidden love but much, much, MUCH more graphic.  Definitely not for kids (the falling body parts in the pool at the end of the film put this one over the top for an "R" rating).  The love part isn't overdone like it is in Twilight and the characters are real people, not hairless musclebound teenagers that use any excuse to take their shirts off.  It's a cute little love story.<br /><br />Now, normally I am very black and white on villains, killers, moral vagrants, etc. in that I believe one must atone for their mistakes in one way or another.  However, despite the vampire character randomly attacking and killing innocent people, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her since it's in her nature.  She is no more guilty than an alligator taking a victim that got too close to the water in a swamp.  It also adds to the character development of both the boy (I never could remember names) and the vampire as they struggle with this horrific truth and try to go on with their lives.  It kept us reeled in.<br /><br />Now, I did not see the original so I cannot comment on whether it is better, worse, or about the same.  While I never pass up a good foreign film such as Das Boot, My Sassy Girl (the Korean version), or any good anime, this one slipped under my radar.  Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, I was very impressed with this one.  I might actually show my girlfriend this one and that's a big deal since I've only shown her my favorites.  Well worthy of viewing for anyone... except children.</p></body></html>

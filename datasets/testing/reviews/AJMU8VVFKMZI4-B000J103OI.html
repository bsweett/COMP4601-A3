I'm not a fashionista or even pretend to understand the whoopla surrounding that world.  However, TDWP is a character study movie that entertains and spins out some life lessons.  I do agree with Andrea's take.  If Miranda was a man no one would have said jack about his impossible demands or even blink of what is sacrificed for the sake of success in the business world.  Andrea's ugly ducking transformation is but a small part of the movie.  And frankly if she thinks the rules are any different in the world of hard hitting journalism then she's in for another eye opening experience.  Tucci was also equally impressive in his performance.  But over all I think the screenwriters and the director did a remarkable job on such mediocre "best selling" book.  I love how in the special features section the trip to the big screen that they all but admitted that the book was just one dimensional.  Over all.  Great movie.</p></body></html>

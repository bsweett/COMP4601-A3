<meta name="summary" content="notht eh best HD-DVD, but pretty good"></head><body><p>Everyone knows the movie, so which is the home video version to own?  The HD-DVD, of course, but only by a slim margin.  The differences between this HD edition and the standard edition are not quite the leap of other releases.  Yes, this movie does benefit from the higher resolution.  It just does not pop off the screen like so many other HD releases.  Perhaps it is not meant to shine as brightly when you consider the artistic intent of the cinematographer.  Still other HD editions of dark films such as Million Dollar Baby and (to a lesser extent) Ray, I still think that more could have been done from the encoding side to cring out more details.  Perhaps the length of the movie played a part...who knows.  In any case, my purpose is to review this edition.  Surely it is still the one to own, beating all other home video presentations to date.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Powerful, Gritty, Worthwhile Drama"></head><body><p>The first few minutes of AHX are intended to horrify and shock you, to show the callousness of people who hate other people simply because of racial or ethnic stereotypes that have been blindly forced upon them.  Edward Norton really shows off his acting chops as he transforms from a bigoted, murderous neo-Nazi to a gentle, rehabilitated older brother trying to prevent his impressionable younger brother (Edward Furlong) from following in his misguided footsteps.<p>The film is both uplifting and tragic, as well as brutally realistic.  Without spoiling the ending for anyone who has not seen the film, Norton's pain and guilt will linger with you long after the credits roll.  Yet from all the tragedy of the hate and violence that consume the characters in this film comes a ray of hope--with the guidance of Dr. Bob Sweeney (played by Avery Brooks) Norton's character, and ultimately Furlong's character, both have small victories in overcoming the cycle of hate.  The ending of the film reminds us, however, that we still have a long way to go in race relations in America.<p>Beverly D'Angelo, Elliot Gould, Stacey Keach, and Fairuz Balk also play convincing supporting roles in this powerful drama that is well worth watching.  Although it is certainly not intended for young children with its violence and graphic rape, AHX is one of those films that should be mandatory for older teens (17-18), especially those who might be pre-disposed to hate a certain religious or ethinic group due to their environment.  As another reviewer aptly stated: "hate is learned and can be unlearned."  The un-learning of hate is precisely what this film is all about.</p></body></html>

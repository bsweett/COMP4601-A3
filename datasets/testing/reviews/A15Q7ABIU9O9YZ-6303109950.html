<meta name="summary" content="Tombstone. Serious stuff."></head><body><p>There's a lot to be said for this version of the 'Gunfight at the OK Corral.' Like many westerns, it's a story of honor, loyalty, and an inescapable journey wrestling with one's character.<p>In many ways, it bears striking similarity with Alan Ladd's portrayal of Shane many, many years ago. Both Shane and Wyatt Earp have a violent past, to some extent supported by a sense of honor, yet violent nonetheless. Both men imagine they can escape that past and live a life of peace and normalcy. Both men fail. Kevin Costner faces a similar conflict in &quot;Open Range,&quot; and all men have a similar narrator, so to speak, Dana Delaney in &quot;Tombstone&quot; being the most recent.<p>Powerful roles are fulfilled by Sam Elliott as brother Virgil, but perhaps the most telling observation is made by the youngish Bill Paxton playing the role of brother Morgan, who tells Wyatt when he won't go along with him and Virgil to again strap on the six-shooters, &quot;you gotta' back your brother's play.&quot;<p>If I found pleasure in the movie it was superlative qualities of all of the actors, and the grittiness of the scenery. On occasion it almost left you with a feeling of dust in your mouth. If there was a let down it was the eventual union with Dana Delaney which, when acted out, almost seemed inconsequential in light of the ensuing carnage following the 'OK Corral' incident. I found equally unsatisfied with the ending of &quot;Open Range,&quot; where again 'true love' did not appear to be much of an antidote for the extraordinary emotional and physical trauma earlier experienced. And a lot of blood. To me, it seemed much more logical when a weary Alan Ladd rode away at the ending of the much earlier &quot;Shane.&quot;<p>Having said that, &quot;Tombstone&quot; carries the day with brilliant acting on all levels, especially Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer, who carry the supporting roles they are assigned as the ailing Doc Holliday and Virgil with a high level of skill. 5 stars.

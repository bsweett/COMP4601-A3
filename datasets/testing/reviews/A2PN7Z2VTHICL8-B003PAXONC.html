<meta name="summary" content="A new version of the 1954 novella 'I Am Legend'"></head><body><p>Colonel Robert Neville, also a doctor, is the last man alive in New York City.  He broadcasts daily on AM radio asking for people to meet up with him at what looks to be an old naval base by the water.  Neville and his German Shepherd Sam show up everyday looking for other survivors of the virus, named KV.  Once thought to be the cure for cancer, the engineered virus mutated and spread airborne, killing people and radically altering those who didn't die into zombie-like, mindless beings.<br /><br />Neville spends his days hunting deer, loose from the park or the zoo, and picking up supplies for his house.  His nights are spent inside his altered house, shuttered and barricaded against the beasts of the night.  Beneath the house is his lab, where he continues to work diligently on a cure for those infected monsters that prowl the streets at night, hungry for blood.  He sets traps to catch the zombies for test subjects using his serums.  At last, Neville believes he's found a serum that will work.<br /><br />During an excursion in town, Neville notices one of his store mannequins has been moved, and when he investigates he's caught in a trap and unconscious until nightfall.  Who moved the mannequin and who set the trap?  Is someone else still alive and uninfected?  Neville and Sam must make it back to the car before sundown, but the hour is late and the darkness is falling.  Something bad is about to happen.<br /><br />To those of you who've read the classic 1954 novella, 'I Am Legend', by Richard Matheson, the movie does not follow the book very well.  Other movies have been made from the novella, including the 1964 movie 'The Last Man On Earth' and 'The Omega Man' filmed in 1971 starring Charlton Heston. In this version, the infected are more like zombies than vampires, and more aggressive.  The film had been modernized (the incidents in the book take place in 1976) which is more attractive to today's audiences, and there's a lot more action involved.  The movie is more external (action) which is well suited for a film version than the book, which is more internal (introspective), but what I really didn't like was how they twisted the ideal of Neville's "legend" status.<br /><br />Will Smith does an excellent performance as Neville, and the atmosphere of a deserted New York City was captured quite nicely.  The zombies are pretty cool, though I don't know who dreamed up the hairless idea.  Sam the dog is added to the film (not in the book) but Sam stole the show for me.  (I love German Shepherds!)  If you're a Matheson fan and have enjoyed both novella and the other remakes of this story, then 'I Am Legend' is well worth the purchase.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best Animated Film in Years"></head><body><p>There is nothing not to like about The Incredibles!  As with all the best recent animated films, the jokes may be over a kid's head, but that is what keeps the parents buying the tickets.  The Incredibles is a fun look at heros similar to the ones we all grew up with...only a little older.  This is one of those movies that is so good you hope the DON'T make a sequel.  A sequel would only cheapen this originally funny film.  After all, there really is nothing to add to this imaginative piece of art.</p></body></html>

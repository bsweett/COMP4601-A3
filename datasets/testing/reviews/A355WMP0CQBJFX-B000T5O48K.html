<meta name="summary" content="THIS MOVIE WAS BUGGIN FOR REAL!"></head><body><p>bug was way different than what i expected. i just thought i was really going to see some bugs, but they were the only ones who saw them. trippy movie, but grabbed my attention from start to finish. it was good all the way through. from the lonely waitress in fear of her ex husband and full of guilt of losing her child, to the strange drifter, and everything that follows that. it had a good introduction explaining her solitude, and then it just went full blast. i guess when you're that depressed and alone you believe whatever you have to so you won't feel that way again. it was a mind thriller, not scary, or gross, just wierd and captivating. the only problem i had was the ending. it was a good ending, but it left you hanging. i would have wanted to see something else. the actors were good. ashley judd, i can't hate, the woman did her thing. she was great. she played the part, she was convincing, and she delivered. nice job. it just gives you a glimpse through the eyes of some really disturbed people. a day to us how they live everyday of their lives. it's suprising with how just a few words they can suck you in and you may never get out. defenitly recommend.</p></body></html>

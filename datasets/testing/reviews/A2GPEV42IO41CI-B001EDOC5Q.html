There they meet Prince Caspian of Telmarine (next door to Narnia), who has just escaped his evil uncle's henchmen.  It seems the Telmarines thought Narnia and its inhabitants were gone forever - it has been 1300 (Narnian) years since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAFJXE">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>.  The Pevensies take up their royal mantels as Kings and Queens of Narnia and vow to help Caspian regain his rightful crown and free the Narnians.<br /><br />At least that's what I think it was about.  Honestly, there are so many Battles To The End, strange characters, and unintelligible accents that I had to content myself with understanding the basics and wishing it would end soon.  I loved the first movie; I thought the Pevensies were adorable, the creatures of Narnia were charming, and Aslan was magnificent, but all that's changed here:  The kids don't get a chance to be kids or interact on a normal level so there's not much opportunity to feel like I knew them.  A (poorly-drawn) CGI badger and a sour-puss dwarf are the main Narnians.  Neither touched me; in fact, the dwarf was off-putting.  And Aslan - ah, I wanted him to be Perfect again and bring me to tears, but, alas, he's also poorly-drawn and we see very little of him.  When we do, it's just not the same.<br /><br />The scenery is breathtakingly gorgeous, but there are just too many intense battles against villains who all look and speak alike (why couldn't they have nice British accents!?)  There's nothing cuddly-cute about Narnia or awesomely divine about Aslan and the kids are reduced to killing machines.  Action fans may love this movie, but I was disappointed.</p></body></html>

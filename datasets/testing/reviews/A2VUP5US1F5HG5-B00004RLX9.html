<meta name="summary" content="STAR TREK II:  THE WRATH OF KHAN"></head><body><p>This is Star Trek's finest hour.  Realizing the missed opportunities of the plodding Star Trek:  The Motion Picture, the superior sequel is non-stop excitement from the get-go.  Digging Khan Singh out of the classic Trek catacombs was a masterstroke, and Ricardo Montalban's performance as the revenge-crazed renegade is splendid.  Many fans also remember this film as Kirstie Alley's debut feature, and with good reason--her Saavik is an enchanting combination of elfin beauty and barely restrained Romulan fire.  Naturally, the cast of Trek familiars all perform admirably, and the special effects bring the myriad fantasy sequences (including alien brain eels and brilliant starship duels) to pyrotechnic reality, all the more effective because they highlight so many dramatic characterizations.  And James Horner's score is the best of any Trek film so far.  Parallel to the main revenge plot are two well-handled subtexts:  age and mortality.  On top of it all, Captain Kirk is reunited with an old flame and meets the son he has never known, only to suffer the heart-wrenching loss of his closest friend.  Well-conceived, written, and directed, Star Trek II is a relentlessly suspenseful and engaging sci-fi extravaganza, and clearly the standard against which all other Star Trek features must be measured.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The greatest movie ever made"></head><body><p>Memento is definitely my personal favorite movie. It is just above &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; on my list. The entire movie keeps the viewer's attention, as it is backwards. It is very fun to watch (alone or in a group). The acting is incredible, and so is the Academy Award nominated script. The editing was also nominated. I would recommend this movie to just about anybody. The R rating is due to violence and profanity, including a scene with an obscene amount of strong language. I can't say enough about this movie. There is nothing like it. There are no mistakes and it is completely unpredictable. I give it five stars out of five.</p></body></html>

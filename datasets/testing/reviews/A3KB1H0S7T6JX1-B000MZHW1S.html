All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few tears.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Blood Diamond is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  4 1/2 Stars</p></body></html>

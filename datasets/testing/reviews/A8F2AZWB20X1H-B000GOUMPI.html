<meta name="summary" content="For once, Hollywood does it right"></head><body><p>Stephen King's books have usually made a transition to the screen ranging from so-so to god-awful, but in &quot;The Shining&quot;, Stanley Kubrick has made a movie that is actually better than the book.  It's tight, spare, lean, mean, and spooky as hell.  From the marvelous opening, of a lone Beetle making its way up a spectacularly beautiful and utterly empty mountainous terrain, we get a sense of the crushing loneliness and isolation that eventually drives the film's protagonist over the edge, coupled with his out-of-control alcoholism.  Jack Nicholson is a diabolical presence as Jack Torrance, the frustrated playwright who takes an off-season job as caretaker of a once-glamorous hotel gone slightly to seed; after being kicked out of his teaching position at a posh prep school, it's the only job he can find to support his clueless wife and his five year old son Danny.  Danny has the &quot;shine&quot; on him, which means he has the gift of Sight, and he is able to see, as neither of his parents can, the ghastly doings that have haunted the old hotel where he and his family are trapped for the long winter.  Jack's descent into madness and his wife's growing panic are wonderfully portrayed in the film.  Probably nobody else could have played this part as effectively as Nicholson; with his peaked eyebrows and sardonic, twisted grin, he even looks devilish.  Shelly Duvall as his wife overdoes the shaking and quaking in some scenes, but she is very good as the wife who just wants to protect their son and get them both out of this possessed hellhole alive.  The only disappointment in the film was the diminished role of the cook Hallorann, who understands Danny's gift because he shares it; although Scatman Crothers was very good indeed in this part, we saw much more of him in the book and we should have seen more of him in the movie.  The cinematography and the music are both excellent and effectively contribute to the film's atmosphere of haunting isolation and insulation.  King must have been glad when he saw this movie that at least one of his books came out right on film.</p></body></html>

His performances have satisfied the Wolverine lover in me since X-Men 1.  Many people have complained about this film, but I find little to complain about.  For me, it was entertaining throughout.  You do have to suspend disbelief a lot, but that is the nature of comic book superhero films.  They have spectacular powers, and display them often.  It is really fun to watch.  I'm glad they got to include Gambit in this movie, who wasn't present in the X-Men Trilogy.  I think he's a really cool character.<br /><br />And of course, there's Logan, A.K.A. Wolverine.  I liked that you got to see him as a boy with bone claws.  After all, it is an origin film.  Without giving away the story, I can say that if you were wondering how he goes from bone claw kid to adamantium-laced superhero, this movie covers that.<br /><br />Good special effects, lots of action, a large group of superheroes showcasing their abilities, if you are a fan of these things you'll probably like the movie, as long as you don't nitpick about the minutiae.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just Hang On And Enjoy The Ride"></head><body><p>Sure, TAKEN is about eight feet over the top and soundly jumps the shark when Neeson's Super Dad/Super Bad character lands on the evil sultan's yacht (and those of you who have seen this film will know exactly what I'm talking about), but who cares?  TAKEN is not for Sundance audiences or art houses; it's grand edge-of-your-seat escapism that takes the viewer on a wild, bumpy ride as former CIA agent (at least, we assume he's former CIA) Bryan Mills goes to Paris to kick some serious bad guy arse.<br /><br />After grudgingly giving his teenage daughter (who lives in the lap of luxury with her mother and ultra-rich stepfather) permission to spend the summer in Paris with a friend and the friend's "cousins", we are not surprised to see the daughter get violently kidnapped by Albanian thugs running a sleazy prostitution ring.  Well, they picked on the wrong teenager, as agent Mills (Liam Neeson plays this delightfully close to the vest) is about to show them all who's your Daddy.  Putting all his clandestine skills to task, Mills mows through the Paris underground like a weedeater on acid, doing mega damage to all who stand in his way.  Of course, his relentless, cold-blooded, calculating pursuit ultimately pays bloody dividends and last-second heroics, making TAKEN one fun ride--even if none of it is believable.<br />--D.

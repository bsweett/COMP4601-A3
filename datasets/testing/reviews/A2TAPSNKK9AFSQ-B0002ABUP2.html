In this movie the zombies all move at normal sped so you don't know who the zombies are or who are "the good guys'. It is AN UNWRITTEN LAW in good Horror movies that zombies are supposed to walk in a slow shuffle. No doubt the makers of this film realized that today's youth have a very short  Attention Span thanks to the flashing 3 minute video clips on MTV so they decided to speed things up. Forget this movie and watch the original 1978 Classic if you want to see how it is done properly.I give this movie 5 stars because it does have some "Shock Value".</p></body></html>

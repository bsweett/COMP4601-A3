<meta name="summary" content="THE RIGHT ONE"></head><body><p>Hollywood has always thought of itself as the be all to end all. But the elite have always held fast that foreign films were the way to go. So Hollywood has chosen to remake a number of foreign films with highs and lows in success. A new film is already set for remake but this week finds the original released on DVD.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a hybrid film. By hybrid think of combining films. The western and sci fi flicks were married in STAR WARS. Musicals and romance films in STEP UP. This film is an even stranger mix combining coming of age, romance and horror. But then vampires and romance seem to have gone hand in hand forever, just not quite this young.<br /><br />Oskar is a 12 year old growing up in a city in Sweden. His life is fairly boring with the exception of the school bully picking on him most of the time and Oskar doing nothing in retaliation.<br /><br />A new neighbor moves into the apartment next to Oskar and his mother, a late middle aged man and a young girl. Oskar notices the covered windows but doesn't realize why until much later.<br /><br />Sitting in the courtyard on the jungle gym, Oskar first meets Eli. Clad in thing clothes and barefoot, he asks if she isn't cold. Her reply is that she isn't that she doesn't remember how to be cold. And so begins an unusual friendship.<br /><br />The man living with Eli is her benefactor. His job is to provide her a place to stay and fresh blood so that she doesn't have to go out and hunt, thus placing herself in jeopardy. But he's beginning to slow down, failing to complete the tasks. While one victim does die, his blood isn't captured and brought home requiring Eli to go out on her own. The attack is simple but seen and when people begin to talk about a child killing a full grown man, few believe the tale.<br /><br />Oskar and Eli begin to spend time together while Oskar's mother is at work. The required invitation to a vampire for entry is offered and Eli enters the apartment. But Oskar still doesn't realize exactly what Eli is.<br /><br />When an encounter with the school bully and his pals results in Oskar having a slice on his cheek he lies to Eli (and his mother) about how he got the injury. But Eli sees the truth. And her advice to Oskar is that the next time it happens, to make sure and hit the bully...hard.<br /><br />The film moves slowly, taking it's time with the timid pacing to set the stage. We begin to see Oskar starting to have a bit more confidence in himself. And when he finally does take on the bully, we cheer for him and at the same time worry that he will be changed to a more horrendous figure.<br /><br />As for Eli, her need to attack comes out after her benefactor fails his own plot for murder, leaving her with no one to fetch nourishment for her. The attacks she makes are the most disturbing images seen in this film. Thoughts of a child doing such horrible deeds are the things of nightmares.<br /><br />Eli reveals herself to Oskar but not before he puts her to a test: entering his apartment without the required invitation. The results are disturbing but soon forgotten. The strangest part is that Oskar has moved from his timid victim to a defensive individual able to stand up for himself, even to Eli.<br /><br />When the murders begin to set the stage for Eli being caught its time to move on. But not before one final moment when Oskar is beset not by just the bully but by his older brother, a budding psychopath if there ever was one.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN has been hailed as a terrifying film for fans of the genre. But as I watched I never found myself frightened. I did find the film fascinating in its depiction of a world I've never seen, Sweden. And the characters were enough to hold my interest, especially the interaction between the pair as they discovered one another.<br /><br />If your cup of tea is the rapid paced films seen more often than not then this movie isn't for you. If you like something with a bit more substance that takes it's time to tell you the story then you might want to give it a try. The effects are not gore filled, the feeling is eerie and the tale is original. And once the story finishes, you might think twice before opening the door to anyone.</p></body></html>

Yes, you read that right!!!  [...] But it blew me away!<br />It obviously won't appeal to many people.  But Eli Roth pulls no punches with this sequel.  The fact that this was released mainstream is totally beyond my comprehension.  If you hated the original Hostel, why would you even bother with this one?<br />Okay, I'm sure you know the story.  I won't go into any details of any of the horrendous torture scenes.  Just be prepared.<br />There were other scenes that were totally frightening as well.  Like when one of the girls is being chased through the woods barefoot in her bathrobe.  Or when a girl is chained-up and suspended naked in mid-air, the long blade of a schythe is dragged along her back, not initially breaking the skin.  Just pure fright factor.  Or one of the most jolting non-violent scenes happens early on--pictures and descriptions of the 3 girls are sent to various clients on their blackberries.  Then the auction begins, each girls fate sold to the highest bidder.  [...] Heather Matarazzo(the nerdy schoolgirl from Welcome to the Dollhouse)gives an especially incredible performance.  Bijou Phillips(from Bully)doesn't try to tone down her sex appeal.  Lauren German is also stupendous.<br />This is one brutal movie!  There were many times I was squirming in my seat and even screaming obsceneties at the screen.  It's a fearful, disgusting, morbid great time. [...]</p></body></html>

As far as movies about serial killers go, David Fincher might find that with this and Se7en, he has earned both second and third place, paying homage to his master, Hitchcock, who retains first place with his cross-dressing shower murderer.<br /><br />Avid enthusiasts of the Zodiac case will find this movie faithful in many departments and it does try to reveal the executioner which is impressive for a serial killer movie about a slaughterer that was never caught... well at least officially. Fincher implicates one of the possible suspects beyond a doubt so we do find closure.<br /><br />However, Zodiac is more than just a serial killer movie. It is about obsession and how it destroys lives. The film leaves you wondering, who is more obsessed and deluded? The serial killer who stalks victims for media fame, or the cartoonist turned wannabe detective who abandons his family and fills his rooms with boxes of files instead of his kids. In a memorable scene which describes the vast time periods involved (the film spans over 20 years) his kids know the ins and outs of the case better than some detectives do.<br /><br />This is well made, well acted film that also looks great. Fincher is never shy to the make the most of his cinematography. Even the overhead car tracking shots reveal that Fincher has still got tricks up his sleeve. The lighting, like in Se7en, is impeccable. Zodiac has some of highest production values that you can find in any contemporary classic.<br /><br />Overall the Zodiac is a must see for the high pace suspense. So much goes on in so little time you should feel the urge to watch it again. When films do that, they give you a reason to own it. Fincher makes films that people with brains want to see.<br /><br />In an era gone by when teen lovers are either slashed by dream demons with razor fingers or bludgeoned by a guy in a hockey mask (insert clown mask also), there is nothing more terrifying than the thought of a guy who breathes heavy on the end of the phone or calls in to a chat show to discuss his little problem of knifing up women while denying that his over-the-air shrieks from beyond this dimension are anything other than just his headache.</p></body></html>

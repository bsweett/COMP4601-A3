<meta name="summary" content="Just like "Blow", but with guns"></head><body><p>Five minutes into "Lord of War" I realized that I had seen this film before, except it starred Johnny Depp, and was about cocaine trafficking and was called "Blow". Yeah, there are a lot of similarities between "Lord of War" and "Blow", both plot-wise and in the style of the films.<br /><br />"Lord of War" tells the story of Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a Ukrainian-American arms dealer, who brags about having sold guns to every army on Earth except for the Salvation Army. Although Orlov is a fictional character, the script is based on actual events and is so well researched that it is completely believable to the point of being scary. Orlov is a completely immoral character who is unashamed of what he is doing and the idea that people like him could actually exist is genuinely frightening.<br /><br />From an entertainment point of view, "Lord of War" is not a fun film. The first half of the film, which details the rise of Yuri Orlov and his arms deals in assorted Eastern European countries is enjoyable enough, but I found the second half, in which Orlov moves into the war-ravaged African countries, to be depressing. The film is redeemed by an ending which I liked very much, but because of the scenes set in Africa, I probably won't be watching this film again in a hurry.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Nicolas Cage is excellent in this film. Initially, I felt that he was just playing the same character that he has played in every other film, but Cage's portrayal of Orlov as a man whose soul has been totally destroyed by his actions, at the end of the film, is still haunting me as I write this. Overall, I preferred "Lord of War" to "Blow" because, unlike in "Blow", the makers of "Lord of War" weren't afraid to show Orlov for who he really is, a soulless man responsible for the deaths of millions.</p></body></html>

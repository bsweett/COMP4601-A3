Stallone is going to visit an old war friend when he wanders into the wrong town. He is arrested and treated bad by the local sheriff played well by Brian Dennehy. Rambo retaliates and escapes. The local sheriff's department face the battle of their lives with Rambo.His vast<br />knowledge of jungle warfare goes well in the mountains of the<br />surrounding area.Rambo's old commander(played by Richard Crenna)<br />comes in to save the Sheriff's Department from Rambo. This is a<br />good movie thar illustrates the Vietnam vet and their life after the war. You movie will make an impression on you.It is a good movie as well with a good plot and plenty of action. You will not be dissapointed.</p></body></html>

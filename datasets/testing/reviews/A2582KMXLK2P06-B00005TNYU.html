Some of the scenes looked familiar like I'd seen bits and pieces of the film in the past, but I don't think I ever sat down and actually watched it the entire way through.  This is hard to believe considering I spent my entire childhood in the 80's.<br /><br />Well, for the most part it's a family/adventure type film involving a group of troublemaker kids around 10-years old and going on an enormous adventure.  It's funny whenever the kids think they're doing something they'll be grounded for, it's actually mild compared to things kids do in reality.<br /><br />As you can tell, adventure movies came a long way since the Goonies- just look at Harry Potter for example. Two completely different films perhaps, but both putting heavy emphasis on the adventurous aspect of the storytelling.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie aged somewhat well. You can definitely tell it was released in the mid 80's, and my goodness, Anne Ramsey is one of the scariest women of all time! I mean that as a compliment- she'd immediately scare *any* troublemaker child straight just by looking at them with that mean expression on her face!  I remember her fondly throughout the 80's- rest in peace.  A terrific actress she was.<br /><br />This is a pretty good film. I'm surprised it's popular enough to have received 500 reviews here on amazon, but I guess it's easy to see why- it's a fun flick.  Perhaps the Goonies is more important than I'm giving it credit for and it's considered either a perfect timepiece of the 80's, or I'm just underrating its overall popularity, or maybe it's a major influence on something.  Whatever the case, I'm glad I watched it.</p></body></html>

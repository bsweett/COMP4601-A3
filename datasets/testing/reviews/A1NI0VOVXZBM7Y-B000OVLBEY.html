<meta name="summary" content="Ghost Rider Movie Dvd."></head><body><p>Ghost Rider could have been better,alot better,darker considering it's Ghost Rider. Eva Mendes is beautiful, But Nicolas Cage?(he's cool, he has alot of cool cars,Corvettes in his movies) but come on? Typical Hollywood Adaption of A Comic book,not true to story.and Peter I am a commie fonda?Some Bad CGI AND fights. But I didn't hate the movie. 3 to 3 1/2 stars for the movie.</p></body></html>

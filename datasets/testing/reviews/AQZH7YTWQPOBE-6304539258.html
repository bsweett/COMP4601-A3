It's a great movie, but it came out in an era when people didn't have home video players (much less DVDs). Lucas cleaned up the movies, made the ships more realistic, and generally most of the improvements make the film look better. I agree that I wish Lucas didn't mess with the Greedo scene - I still believe Han shot first. However, that's relatively minor. Don't let that ruin the movie for you. I think overall you'll find yourself enjoying Star Wars all the more with this DVD version.</p></body></html>

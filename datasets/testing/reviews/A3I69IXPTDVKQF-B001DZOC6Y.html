<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Most Remarkable End-Of-The-World Scenarios Yet"></head><body><p>The sudden appearance of a never-before encountered disorder in the Northeastern United States - which moves swiftly through its stages to its final phase of causing the seemingly oblivious infected to take their own lives - launches The Happening.  The apocalypse has apparantly arrived in a most unexpected fashion, and it's jolting and eerily believable.  A small group of people tries to figure out what's going on and try and avoid the inevitable of becoming afflicted, as the menace quickly spreads from its point-of-origin and threatens to take on global proportions.<br /><br />  When I first saw this one, I was under the impression that the nature of the phenomenon was going to remain a big secret until the end but that wasn't the case or the intention, and the general apparant cause of all the strange events comes out pretty quickly.  I still hesitate to give it away because it IS more effective if you go into it without too much foreknowledge the first time.  I will say that with the way the filmmakers executed it; with the citing of real-life similar phenomenon on a much smaller scale; with the drawing of attention to the fact that there's still much more about the world and the universe that humanity doesn't know than it does; and with a general projection of a sense of wonder about the mystery and grandeur of the cosmos, or nature or existance or whatever you want to call it, it makes the bizarre scenario feel real, and not far-fetched or contrived.  The interactions between the characters, including ones who are total strangers when the events begin, are powerful and engaging.  Many apocaltptic movies do well focusing on the darker aspects of people emerging in the shadow of The End, but The Happening follows a different route and focuses mostly on brighter, more benevolent instincts taking over.  There's one particularly poignant moment near the very end, which may actually involve more participants than it appears.<br /><br />  All in all, a riveting, frightening, powerful movie that defies easy classification.  Highest recommendation.</p></body></html>

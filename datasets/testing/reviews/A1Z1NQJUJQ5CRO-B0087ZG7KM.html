<meta name="summary" content="Juvenile humour in this "comedic"yawn fest"></head><body><p>I got my advanced copy of Bridesmaids(theatrically released May/11),through a store which mistakenly released it too early,anticipating great things according to all the hype and reviews on it,and of course the big bonanza at the box office.Boy was I disappointed;gags that a one year old could see coming even before the movie rolled.It stars Kristen Wiig as Annie who also co wrote the screenplay along with Annie Mumolo.Jill Clayburgh who I hadn't seen for far too long plays Annies mother.It is a shame she passed away late last year before the movie even opened as she gave as best a performance as she could considering the inane material given to her.There is even an outtake where one actress apologizes for making her having to say the lines that she does.Add to this,in Canada at least,a terrible layer change hesitation on the disc,the length of which I've never encountered.<br />Anyways on with the plot.It involves the aforementioned Annie who had a bakery business that went bust and like the business,her romance department is in equal doldrums.She is going with a self absorbed twit named Ted(John Hamm) and she lives with two totally off the wall characters by the names of Gil(Matt Lucas) and his sister Brynn(Rebel Wilson).Thrown into the mix is Annie's life long friend Lillian(Maya Rudolph)who is getting married and Annie is picked as her maid of honour.<br />One of Lllian's bridesmaids Helen(Rose Byrne) doesn't see eye to eye with Annie and the two from the get go pick at each other and try to out do each other at every turn.Helen is married to a well off banker exec so she can afford the luxuries to throw Lillian's way and at the same time impress the heck out of everyone else.Things just go steadily downhill for Annie who manages to get everyone sick at a restaurant they eat at and on a flight to Vegas for the bachelorette party she becomes drunk(in big part due to Helen's advice)and gets the plane diverted to Wyoming.<br />Back home Annie flirts with and eventually sleeps with a local Irish born cop named Nathan(Chris Dowd).However due to the stress of everything she shy's away from getting too deep and backs off any further personal interaction.Annie travels to Chicago to attend her friends bridal shower only to find that Helen has stolen the very Parisian theme she had envisioned for it.When Helen offers to take Lillian to Paris for a dress fitting with the designer himself she melts down and trashes much of the table settings and leaves.Annie is banned from the wedding by Lillian.<br />On the way home Annie's car breaks down,and that being the final straw,she retreats into her apartment.Fellow bridesmaid Megan(Melissa Mccarthy)comes around and gives Annie some much needed advice and gets her out of her depression.Annie bakes a cake to makes amends to the cop but it remains on the doorstep where she left it.Helen then shows up saying Lillian has disappeared but also apologizes for her behavior towards her.The search for Lillian ends at her apartment and the two reconcile.Annie is reinstated as the top bridesmaid and the wedding goes off without a hitch,with Nathan arriving on the scene to also reconcile with Annie.<br />Some of the best moments in this movie come from the unexpected places and not necessarily from its' two main characters.Melissa Mccarthy plays the over weight but plucky and steadfast friend/bridesmaid and she is given some worthwhile moments on the flight to Vegas and her heart to heart with Annie.The brother and sister Annie live with are almost alien like and quite creepy but so off the wall that you have to shake your head more than once.Ben Falcone as the "no I'm not an Air Marshall" gives an understated but decent performance,as does Franklyn Ajaye as Lillian's dad.And watch for a brief appearance by Terry Crews who played Gerard Butler's nemesis in the great action film Gamer.<br />However over all the so called gags are strained and quite,QUITE shallow.It starts from the very beginning where Annie is leaving Ted's place and the motorized gate is closed.Of course this wouldn't happen in real life as it would be obvious the gate would have to get opened in order for her to leave,but yes I know,this is just a movie.Who couldn't see that once she climbed that gate to get over it,it would somehow open with her on it? We then find Annie talking sexual humour with her friend Lillian...whoopee.The scenes where the bridesmaids get sick is quite gross and WAY too obvious.Her roommate Byrne is on the big side and when she shows Annie her tattoo on her back of course this is time to show all the fat folds and the butt crack...been there,done that.*yawn*.Chris Dowd's lackluster performance as Nathan is no where near believable,so I cannot suspend my disbelief long enough to believe why a good looking lady like that would ever fall for a milk toast guy like Natahan. Annie and Helen's attempts at getting Nathan's attention by her constant driving by his squad car are just plain childish stuff and very unfunny.And Wiig's over all performance as Annie is far from ingratiating.It's underplayed too much and the spark just is not there.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its a/r of 2:40:1 and the picture is clear and crisp.This release comes with the theatrical version and the unrated version.There are deleted scenes,extended and alternate ones,a gag reel,commentary and more.There is also(at least in the Canadian release) a terrible layer change hesitation.The scene goes from Nathan and Annie sleeping together to a shot of Annie laying on the bed.I counted at least an eight second hesitation which is the longest I have ever encountered.The disc I checked and it is pristine.This is obviously a manufacturing error and not as a result of a disc scratch or film flaw.Universal take note.<br />All in all a disappointing movie from this reviewers perspective.The humour is oft times of the toilet brand and quite juvenile,so shallow you can see through it and it is telegraphed way,way ahead.It's the old "when you can't think of something smart,go for the lowest common denominator".The main characters did nothing for me but I got the most kicks from the more "minor" co stars.If this is your thing then I recommend it but if not put aside all the hype you've heard,save your money and give it a HUGE pass.</p></body></html>

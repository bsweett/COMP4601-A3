Whether that is good or bad will be up to you, but this is not an average comedy.  First, you'll see as the movie begins, it is presented by Nickelodian.  While there is a little bit of "bathroom humor", there is no bad language or sex in the film, and the movie is even somewhat respectful to the Catholic church and its traditions.<br /><br />Jack Black is Nacho and since he was little, he dreamed of being a wrestler.  Now, grown, he serves all the meals and a Catholic orphanage in Mexico.  Nacho runs off and, while wearing a costume, begins to enter local wrestling matches.  Nacho has dreams of fame and fortune and fighting the champion Ramses.  Ultimately, Nacho must decide what truly matters in life as his wrestling career continues.  The movie is full of quirky characters and understated comedy.  If you've seen Napolean Dynomite, you'll see the style of that film continued here.  And that is one of my major complaints of the film.  The style of the movie almost seems more important that the characters or the plot.  While I enjoyed the movie, I never really felt connected to the characters or worried about the stakes presented to Nacho, the beautiful Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n or his emaciated wrestling partner Esqueleto.<br /><br />Overall, a humorous movie that can be watched with the entire family.  A must see for Napolean Dynomite fans, but general audiences may only be mildly amused.</p></body></html>

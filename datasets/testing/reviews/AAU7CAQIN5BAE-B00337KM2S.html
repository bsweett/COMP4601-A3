<meta name="summary" content="intellectual squalor; really no doubt about how horrible this celluoid is"></head><body><p>There are often times the wooden political influenced motion picture academy of arts and sciences makes grave errors. Off hand I can think of two: not nominating Christian Bale for one of the greatest youth roles in the history of cinema, as 'Jim' in Spielberg's epic 'Empire of the Sun' and two not nominating Streisand as Best Director when Conroy's adaptation of the stellar 'Prince of Tides' was nominated for Best Picture.<br /><br />Here then is another foible of incoherent nonsense the Academy offered as a Best Picture for the cravings of absolute boredom and ineptness. This truly was a gawker, a complete and total meltdown of cinema.<br /><br />"Oh look at me, I'm an intellectual, oh look at me, this movie is for me, oh look at me the rabid coherent neanderthal who thinks anyone that doesn't 'get' this film, is sub-par to most other human beings, because we only like 'bam bam-knock em dead movies', oh look at me and my elite, upper east side tupaware party, PTA mom friends who will get together for dry martini's after this viewing and talk about how 'emotionally gratifying' it was that a film can touch on the 'pseudo' elites lifestyle.....oh look at me, I'm sophisticated, and well if you aren't you just wont get the film, so go watch it again, and if you still dont get it, well then go back to your Transformers, because your feeble mind could never grasp something so pure, driven; a film with such subtle nuances that it touches at the very heart and soul of life..."---><br /><br />Yeah that is what people say to those who give this work of contemptible garbage 1 star. Ohhhhhh all art housey, all bon vivant style acting, from the upper crust of gutter stylish hollywood. Ohh 'it so relates to our times in a way that the actors really touch on personal issues facing all of us and the deeper meaning of and endless search for happiness, when happiness is wafting all around us'. The Academy is an utter atrocity, nominating films like this and the horrid, deplorable Hurt Locker...but then again we know why Formiga Vermigo, Fermogo Verpevo, got nominated because of that little article in that big publication...save it, Nominations have raraly been about the pinnacle of the craft, if that were the case people like Sam Rockwell, Ed Norton, Mike York, Liam Neeson, Sam Elliott, John Malkovich and Joe Levitt, would have won multiple times, for multiple roles..... wahhhhhhh wahhhhh wahhhh<br /><br />wahhhhh wahhh so what I didn't like it, but that doesn't make me less of a human being or less of some type of these amazon hack intellectuals claim that you are if you DONT like it. In fact if you are one of those people who think this movie is the greatest work of pure art since, well I dont know, JewNo, or the like, or Out of Africa, well let me tell you, these are the kind of people I WANT NOTHING to do with. Go have your cheap Chardonnay in your beach homes in wildwood NJ, with your stiff, fake vanilla friends, and I will get along just fine, NOT being one of THOSE intellectuals, but still manage (I KNOW I KNOW>>>>>>>hard to imagine, but...).....still manage to not only enjoy films like Au Revoir Les Enfants, Flight of the Red Balloon, Europa Europa, Scent of the Green Papaya, Like Water for Chocolate and The Village, but also films like Donnie Darko, Transformers, or the next JAMES CAMERON EPIC.....<br /><br />You have seriously, SERIOUSLY have got to be kidding me....</p></body></html>

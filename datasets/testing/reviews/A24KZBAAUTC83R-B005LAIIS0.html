<meta name="summary" content="There were shades of Gray in this movie"></head><body><p>I love movies like this.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this new movie had major issues even my city wife noticed right off.<br /><br />First off, let me say this is a solid movie, but came up short of being one of the greatest of its genre, due to the shortcomings of its storyline and survival techniques.<br /><br />First off, the crash of the plane: I had to suspend disbelief that so many could crash in a plane and come away almost, if not totally, unscathed. Liam Neeson's character wakes up all by himself in the snow, like a car had thrown him out on pillowy snow, not an airplane in brutal conditions. Yeah, right!<br /><br />Secondly: I had to again suspend disbelief that a group of timber wolves all the sudden hunt humans. At least the director/writer tried to explain this, but it was weak. (BTW, the CGI wolves were the best part of this movie!)So, again, as a moviegoer I have to say, OK, I'll let that go for the sake of entertainment.<br /><br />Thirdly: Why would manly men leave the plane crash? They had everything there! Food, shelter, warmth, and the very place that rescuers would be looking. And not one man created or fashioned weapons out of all the debris, even though a pack of huge wolves almost instantly attacked them! Stupid.<br /><br />Fourth: Now Liam Neeson's character plays the hunter that protects the oil men, killing and shootings wild wolves, right? And since he is supposed to know about hunting, animals behavior, etc, then why does he take the survivors right to the very den of the wolves he told the men he was helping was the very bloody reason these wolves were acting the way they were?!<br /><br />Fifth: Now, why on earth did no character bother to fashion spears and walking sticks from the numerous trees that always surrounded them? Here they are, trudging wearily through snow drifts and snow storms, and not a one of them thinks primal! Not one of them thinks to trim some branches and make some makeshift weapons/walking sticks to help them defend themselves and just to walk. Been doing that since caveman days, but modern man in this movie never even thought of it. Stupid!!!!!!<br /><br />Sure, in one scene Liam's character shows the others how to make a sort of shock stick out of branches and shells. OK, on the right track here. Problem is, they use them once and you never even see any of the characters use makeshift spears ever again, despite leg wounds and exhaustion. C'mon, do these directors and screen writers think the audience is that stupid? I guess so, their marketing sucked me in.<br /><br />And lastly is the ending. Total rip-off! Fade to black my ass! Just like the ending of The Sopranos. Rip-off.<br /><br />The movie had so much going for it, too. Haunting. Good idea. Interesting characters and plight. Almost totally wasted to to piss poor directing and writing in minute details that even my NY city wife could see that was so stupid and wrong with this film.<br /><br />I'm just glad the wolves won.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gruesome City"></head><body><p>In black and white like an old gangster movie the gravel voiced good guys<br />are too tough to die without a second shot of electricity...<br />With all the blood, guts, torture and killing it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. All the girls are just as tough and ready as the guys : it's hard to find one that isn't some kind of slut or whore.<br />There is no shade of gray in these bad guys or monsters. It always seems like the bad guys are rich , powerful and on the edge of winning or pulling off  some unspeakable crime like child torture and killing,<br />but the good guys take the bullets and come back for more.<br />Reminds one of a Dick Tracy serial from the 30's.</p></body></html>

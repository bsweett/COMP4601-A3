<meta name="summary" content="Wolf Creek  (2005)"></head><body><p>Director:  Greg McLean<br /><br />Cast:  John Jarratt, Cassandra McGrath, Kestie Morassi, Nathan Phillips, Gordon Poole, Guy O'Donnell.<br /><br />Running Time:  99 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for R for strong gruesome violence, and for language.<br /><br />Three young vacationers are traveling through Australia visiting landmarks and such. One of their most anticipated stops is an ancient meteorite crater park called "Wolf Creek." After enjoying the sights the group prepares to leave, but can't start the car. Their watches have also stopped and a strange, almost supernatural, unease rests in on them. They nervously wait until a kindly stranger (John Jarratt) comes by and tows them to his house and offers to fix their car for free; however, they soon find out that this "kindly stranger" isn't so kind at all.  The resulting film is a well-done, tense horror story. Like many other films to come out of Australia the main story element here is the land and its mystery and as each character tries to escape they are literally swallowed up by the land. The unresolved enigma that the film presents is it's main strength; it can be seen as a metaphor for hell, the personification of true hopelessness, and a regular horror film viewer will be able to draw and appreciate many other things from it. Also much like the recent "High Tension" from France, the film is told in practically real-time as each character tries to desperately climb out of their horrifying situation and figure out what is going on, but primarily they just want to get the hell out of there.<br /><br />Director/writer Greg McLean takes an incredibly long time to set his story up, although it didn't really seem that long to me. The first two thirds of the movies unfold like a love story rather than a horror flick. The cinematography is beautiful and it's real nice to see the three main characters hanging out, having fun and falling in love with each other as they travel across the country. Those aren't your average shallow horror characters. You can identify with those people, you like them and the more you do, the more you feel uncomfortable as they descend into trouble.  The cast is surprisingly very strong; you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone looking as genuinely terrified on screen as Cassandra Magrath and Kestie Morassi. They act and react just like you'd imagine someone in their situation would. John Jarratt as the villain, however, steals the show. Again, this guy just seems so real; you could easily see yourself falling for his tricks only to wake up to him torturing you. This is no chainsaw swinging, skin wearing monster, but a seemingly regular guy that turns out to be a relentless psychopath.  Greg McLean may not re-invent the wheel with "Wolf Creek" but he manages to drive an old genre to near perfection. The movie remains unpredictable throughout and never relies on old tricks. The most disturbing thing about "Wolf Creek" is that you really feel like this could happen to you, which is quite an achievement in a genre that's usually so over the top, it makes you laugh instead of scaring you. "Wolf Creek" will achieve what your mother never could: you'll think twice about trusting helpful strangers.</p></body></html>

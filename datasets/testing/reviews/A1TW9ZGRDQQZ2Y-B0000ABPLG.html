<meta name="summary" content="The greatest movie that nobody saw in theaters"></head><body><p>Thankfully the DVD has been a top seller and everybody (including me) is discovering this gem of a film. Christian Bale is one of our top young actors. Just watch his performances in The Machinist, American Psycho, Batman Begins and one of the best child performances of all time in Empire of the Sun. Everything in this film fits perfectly. The futuristic style, brooding score and unique action scenes are fresh in a genre full of sameness. Equilibrium may bare resemblance to Gattaca and 1984, but it's like those films on steroids. And by the way, Gun Kata is about the coolest style of fighting ever created for a film. I really hope they make Equilibrium 2, but after seeing Ultraviolet (by the same director) I think a sequel will only diminish this already cult classic. They don't need to go The Matrix route.</p></body></html>

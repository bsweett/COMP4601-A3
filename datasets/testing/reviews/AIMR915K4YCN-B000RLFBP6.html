Murphy (Peter Weller) and Lewis (Nancy Allen) are partners in a police force under siege. While sneaking into the hideout of some particularly bloodthirsty and disgusting badguys, led by the reprehensible Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), Murphy is captured, tortured, shot full of holes, and left for dead. This scene is rather disturbing to watch (much like Verhoeven's brain-sucking scene in "Starship Troopers"). Murphy survives, only to become the latest experiment in crime prevention under the control of a mega-corporation called OCP (Omni Consumer Products). He becomes ROBOCOP. His body destroyed, he now has a mechanical one, and is a walking weapon of mass destruction! He sets out to clean up the streets and uphold justice. Unfortunately, the scientists forgot that he was human, and robocop is haunted by memories of his wife and son. He also remembers those who mutilated him. This sets up one of the best revenge films I've ever seen. ROBOCOP uncovers the sinister secrets of OCP's #2 man (Ronny Cox) and must do battle with the ED-209, an earlier robotic crimefighter design with heavy-duty guns and missiles. This battle is ferocious! ROBOCOP is a gruesome tale. However, it also has lots of humor to offset the grim storyline. Verhoeven's portrayal of the media as a blood-circus and vacuous wasteland is pretty accurate, even though he was doing a parody of it. I highly recommend ROBOCOP to all sci-fi / action / black humor fans out there...</p></body></html>

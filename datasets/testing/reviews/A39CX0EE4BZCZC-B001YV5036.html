<meta name="summary" content="Great Story Unfairly Ignored At The Oscars"></head><body><p>This is a good example why ratings for "The Oscars" are declining and was especially low this year.  A quality film like this, beautifully photographed and wonderfully acted got ignored in favor of PC baloney.<br /><br />Building a story around someone with high moral values is apparently not something Hollywood likes to promote.<br /><br />Anyway, this may be the best boxing movie I've ever seen, and I've seen most of them.  It's an old-fashioned underdog rags-to-riches sports story about a very likable hero, heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock, played fantastically by Russell Crowe. This is another "Seabiscuit," meaning a true-life tale of longshot going up against extraordinary odds.<br /><br />More than the boxing, however, this is a great family story of a devoted husband and father and a loving, supporting wife and mother. That's the crux of this biography, more than the boxing angle. Nothing but the highest of morals and ethics are espoused by our hero here, who would starve himself rather see his children miss a meal, while teaching his kids honesty and unselfishness and doing whatever it took to take care of his family. Renee Zellweger also shines as Braddock's wife.  The two make an inspiring couple which is refreshing to see in this age of cynical film-making.<br /><br />The boxing scenes, supervised by real-life Hall Of Fame trainer Angelo Dundee, are lifelike and well-done. Crowe did a wonderful job of imitating Braddock's ring style.<br /><br />The story isn't the only thing that is entertaining. Visually, this is a wonderful treat for your eyes. Director Ron Howard really excelled in capturing the 1930s Depression era with some beautifully muted colors. The sets are fantastic and the clothing, cars, buildings, etc put you smack in the middle of the 1930s. There are great production values in this film and the DVD does it all justice with a fabulous transfer on widescreen DVD.</p></body></html>

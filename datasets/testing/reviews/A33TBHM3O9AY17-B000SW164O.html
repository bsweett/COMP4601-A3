<meta name="summary" content="Decent movie, slow starter.  DeNiro was excellent."></head><body><p>I watched this one over the weekend after my wife brought it home unexpectedly from the video store.  She likes creepy flicks far more than I do.  This one wasn't bad, but it didn't grab me either.  If anything, I found it a bit disturbing.<br /><br />I want to be very careful not to give anything away, because this is one of those mind-twister, big ending movies along the lines of "The Sixth Sense" or "The Village".  Like those other films, this is one where everything seems normal on its face, all the laws of physics are operating normally, yet there appears to be no rational explanation for why these "paranormal" events are occurring.  It's only toward the end that a significant truth is revealed that turns all this on its head, and makes all the unusual stuff fit together in a nice neat little package.<br /><br />Overall I would say this story is reasonably suspenseful and has some eerie elements to it that are only semi-predictable and modestly cliche -- for example, the door with eerie light glowing around it.  There are some moderately graphic death scenes which I don't recommend for the kiddies.  Like "The Village", I thought the "big secret" was given away a little too soon.  From there the story degenerated into a chase sequence more reminiscent of Stephen King's "The Shining".  I thought DeNiro did a bang-up job in a wide-ranging role that really carried an otherwise mediocre story.<br /><br />Would I recommend this movie?  &lt;Shrug>  I dunno.  I guess if you liked "The Sixth Sense" or or a DeNiro fan you'd probably like this one.  Otherwise you're likely to be a little disappointed.</p></body></html>

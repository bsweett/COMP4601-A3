The acting, screenplay, sets, and special effects were great. You feel you are part of the action. You will identify with this group of people being stranded in a grocery store with only a thin plate glass window keeping the horrible creatures outside from devouring them. I know I was on the edge of my seat and found myself drawn in by the great character development. The trip of a small party to the Drugstore next door was harrowing. Each person in the store was very believable. Including the religious zealot that was drawing people to her camp for the "End of Days". Once her camp starts snatching people to throw to the creatures a small group lights out to find rescue. The ending is remarkable and somewhat poetic. I highly recommend this if you enjoy horror SciFi movies. Great quality DVD with good replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to see "Maximum Overdrive", "Phantoms", and "The Relic". - C.

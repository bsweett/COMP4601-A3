When I laugh out loud at a film I'm watching by myself -- and I did laugh out loud more than once -- that film automatically gets my five-star rating.<br /><br />I'm not gonna waste a lot of college-seminar training on an exegesis of this flick. I take it to be a spoof of the genre, a totally tongue-in-cheek satire of fashionable amorality. Some reviewers have compared it to Tarantino. Okay, but it reminded me more of the Coen Brothers, though it wasn't quite THAT funny and it didn't have the ripples of mordant social criticism of a Coen flick.<br /><br />I prefer NOT to recognize actors. When I don't recognize them, I can assume they're acting. The only one I recognized in In Bruges was Ralph Fiennes; I knew I'd seen him before but I couldn't have said when or where. His was the comic villain role and he played it with gruesome delight. Colin Farrell seems to be a household name for other reviewers; I thought he was uproarious -- glum, crass, stupid, Sunday-schoolish -- as the hit man who botched his first hit and missed his merit badge for amorality. Brendan Gleeson was a jolly old elf of a veteran killer with a heart of gold. The city of Bruges played its role of tainted beauty to perfection, an old Medieval tart all gaudied up for tourist johns. I hope the jade got beaucoup Euros for selling itself to the producers of this film.</p></body></html>

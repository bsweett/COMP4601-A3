As his powers are growing and the mystery surrounding his true purpose in life still evades us, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher proves to be much more than most can handle, disrupting Harry's already fragile state of mind in the process...<br />Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with strong elements of fantasy, not to mention some very witty humor.<br />Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, David Thewlis, Alan Rickman (!), Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.<br />The concept, the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is guaranteed to provide a great deal of entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  In short, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection when it becomes available!</p></body></html>

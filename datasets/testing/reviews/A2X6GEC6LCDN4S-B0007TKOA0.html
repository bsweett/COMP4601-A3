<meta name="summary" content="Unlikeable Characters"></head><body><p>This is a big flop, I was disappointed.  None of the characters were likeable and it went too slow.  Church plays a pretty good slime guy you can partially feel sorry for but Giamatti should get the "Dork Actor of the Year" award for this.  How embarrassing, the pathetic novelist who is so unsure of himself, BOO HOO BOO HOO BOO HOO.<br /><br />There was absolutely no moral message in this film, except what NOT to do with your life.  All the characters were quite pathetic and in some cases not very believable.  Thanks for letting me vent.</p></body></html>

Rob Zombie's re-imagining of the Carpenter classic succeeds exactly where it SHOULDN'T:  it humanizes the main villain.<br /><br />Audience mindset:  "Oh, of COURSE he turned out that way!  Poor kid, he's been through so much.  Oh well, la dee dah...la dee dah.  Okay, now the movie is in its second half and we can watch the carnage, which is really why we came, right?  We didn't come to see a well-made movie or an intelligent script.  We came for the carnage."<br /><br />This film is unchallenging and disappointing.  I'm sure the kiddies will love it because it is loud, violent, and viceral.  But most intelligent film-goers will dislike or even resent this movie for its endless list of flaws.  It is a popcorn movie, nothing more.  It will soon be forgotten by nearly everyone.</p></body></html>

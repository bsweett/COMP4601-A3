<meta name="summary" content="Dumb in a gargantuan but glorious fashion! Enjoy!"></head><body><p>This is a spectacular action film, with only half a brain.<br /><br />There's just too many dumb lines in it. Or dumb plot twists. Or dumb explanations.<br /><br />WHO CARES!<br /><br />This isn't nearly as dumb as "The Towering Inferno", and wasn't that nominated for an Academy Award?<br /><br />What you have here is a stereotypical classic disaster picture, with a primary cast of about 12, three or four intertwining plot lines of dubious importance or logic, and some of the most spectacular, awe-inspiring visions of disaster yet put on film. The cast includes Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhal, Sela Ward, Emmy Rossum and a host of recognizable character actors.<br /><br />OK. Go with me here for a second. Not only does the island of Manhattan flood, it does so to a height where an oil tanker can float in front of the Public Library.<br /><br />And then the whole island freezes! With the tanker right there!<br /><br />If your eyes rolled, then this movie ain't for you.<br /><br />No way no how.<br /><br />Yet, if some inner child in you thought briefly, "Coooool" then I think you're in for a treat. The hailstorms, floods, hurricanes...the tornados destroying L.A...ice storms galore...come on now, this is great stuff. Just imagine that not long ago, this would have a miniature cardboard set with a tank of water dropped on it. Now we see the water rising through the manhole covers, the icicles on the Statue of Liberty...the Hollywood sign acting like Dorothy's house in the "Wizard of Oz"...<br /><br />...maybe this seemed better as it's torrentially raining in L.A. right now...<br /><br />My 13-year old nephew thought this movie totally rocked, if that's of any help.<br /><br />If you love disaster movies in general, this is SO up your alley. You have no idea!<br /><br />If you prefer small indie films, run. Run fast.</p></body></html>

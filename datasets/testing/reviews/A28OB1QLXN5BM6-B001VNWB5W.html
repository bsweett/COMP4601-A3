First  picked up in 1986 by 20th Century Fox, the project bounced around the world from the US to the UK to Czechoslovakia, resting briefly at just about every major studio in the world. There were multiple scripts drafted, multiple directors tapped, and a Who's-Who of Hollywood talent courted for the lead roles.  In the end, we got exactly what you'd expect to get: a mess.<br /><br />Think of THE WATCHMEN as The Incredibles, only a lot less entertaining. This is a live-action story of the last of the super-heroes. At the start of the film, we are treated to a wonderful montage that tells us "the story so far." I'm not exaggerating when I say we're treated to it. It's the best part of the film. They should have stopped right there, but they didn't. And I hear that the DVD has 20 minutes MORE for us to suffer through. That comes to 182 minutes of watch-watching pain. I digress.<br /><br />THE WATCHMEN is set in 1985. Richard Nixon is somehow in his third term, the Soviet Union is about to nuke us, and a giant blue super-hero named Doctor Manhattan straddles the world. Naked. (He's naturally blue, too.) Doctor Manhattan is omnipotent which makes him boring. His pal is called Ozymandias, after the Percy Shelley poem. He's all-knowing which makes him petulant and boring. Then there's Doctor Manhattan's love interest, her mom, her former love interest (pretty but boring, boring in bad make-up, could be interesting but is as boring as day-old toast) and the Comedian, an absolutely unlikeable guy who rapes, murders, and laughs about it all. I wish he had been boring, but he was just disturbing.<br /><br />The only interesting character in THE WATCHMEN is Rorschach. His face is an ever-shifting Rorschach ink pattern, which is really cool but odd since he is the only one who doesn't waver in his ideals and commitment. He's a hard-boiled detective who has completely lost sight of the "the line." He doesn't need no stinkin' line. He makes his own line. Rorschach is really the driving force of the flick. His scenes are interesting, understandable, and move the plodding plot along. Even so, some of his scenes are gruesome and unnecessary for the character or the story.<br /><br />Honestly, I get disgusted remembering THE WATCHMEN, not because of the needless gore but because of the wasted effort. The cinematography is wonderful, the soundtrack is classic, but the acting is dreadful and the story is deadly dull with a wholly unsatisfying ending. Yes, I admit it; I sat through the whole thing. I was just HOPING something good would happen. And it did! THE WATCHMEN finally ended.</p></body></html>

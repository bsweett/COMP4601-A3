Although granted, I've been a total Alexander Payne sycophant since I went and saw Election back when I was 20, so I may be somewhat biased.  There's just something he manages to put in every one of his movies that can appeal to just about anyone who takes the time to appreciate them, and this one is no exception.  Sideways is certainly far from the twisted and violent fare I typically patronize, but no matter.  I also hate wine, which occupies a good deal of the focus in this movie, but that proved to be nothing more than a minor stumbling block as well.  This is, to put it simply, a brilliant movie, sometimes not all that easy to watch but in the end all the better for it.  Those accustomed to movies with tidy plots and unambiguous endings will probably find themselves disappointed with this one, but I actually found its irregular rhythms and relaxed pace to be a welcome deviation from the norm.  Sideways is filled with open spaces, uncomfortable silences, and some truly painful moments, but it's also filled with hilarious, deadpan dialogue, occasionally unlikable but persistently believable characters, and random bits of outrageous slapstick humor and unforgettable imagery.  At its best, this movie perfectly captures the boredom, frustration, and mounting indignities of lives that don't turn out the way we think they will.  Not to mention, it further demonstrates Payne's genius when it comes finding meaning and hilarity in the lives of completely ordinary people.<br /><br />Payne has long since demonstrated a knack for crafting characters who are deeply flawed but strangely sympathetic at the same time, and in Miles Raymond he may have his best protagonist yet.  Played in note-perfect fashion down to the minutest facial expression by Paul Giamatti, Miles is a pudgy bundle of nerves, hangups, and regrets who could turn a trip to the bathroom into an occasion for negativity and self-loathing.  This guy is, for lack of a better term, a tool, but at the same time he's the kind of tool you can easily find yourself sympathizing with, even rooting for, in spite of his many less-than-stellar qualities.  Stuck teaching English to eighth-graders while he tries to get his mammoth novel published, and still trying to get over his three-year-old divorce, Miles is rocketing towards middle age and clearly primed for a blowup.  At more than one point in the movie, I found myself thinking Miles was a prime candidate to be found dangling at the end of a rope in his bachelor pad by the end.<br /><br />It's against this backdrop that Miles embarks on a weeklong bachelor-party trip to California wine country with Jack (Thomas Haden Church), his mismatched best buddy, who's looking to score some action before his wedding.  Jack is everything Miles isn't: a laid-back, charming, seat-of-his-pants-living actor who means well but seems completely oblivious to the consequences of his actions.  Although it starts out promisingly enough, the trip quickly becomes an ordeal for Miles as his lack of anything meaningful in common with Jack and his utter discomfort in social situations become increasingly apparent.  It ends up descending into a tangle of lies, infidelity, recriminations, and resentments, as the movie explores such weighty subjects as friendship, love, and the meaning of life without ever being heavy-handed or manipulative about it. There are also plenty of classic comedy moments thrown in to lighten the mood a bit, a few of which rival even anything from Election in terms of hilarity: Miles's erm, vehement objections to ordering Merlot on a double date; his complete meltdown at a low-grade winery when he can't get enough to drink; his discovery of Jack violating a woman in their hotel room; and of course the indelible image of an overweight couple having makeup sex.<br /><br />In a wise move, Payne decides to leave the camera on Miles througout the movie (repeating the device he used with Jack Nicholson's character in About Schmidt), a strategy that pays off as we get to see him at his highest and (mostly) lowest moments, capturing the mounting desperation and alienation that he experiences.  This is obviously a guy who has major difficulty connecting with people, a trait that's certainly not going to serve him well as he continues getting older and less attractive.  The only hope he manages to find comes in the form of Mya (Virginia Madsen, who's old enough to be my much older sister but still pretty hot), a local waitress with whom he manages to form an unlikely connection in spite of himself.  To its credit, though, the movie even leaves that relationship open-ended, as there's ultimately only a hint of an indication where it's going to end up, fitting the air of uncertainty that generally prevails.  The depiction of their relationship is kept pretty low-key, but in a movie that's generally as subdued as this one it wouldn't feel right otherwise.<br /><br />Just in the case the movie isn't enough (which it should be) the DVD edition comes with a commentary from Giamatti and Church that just may be the BEST COMMENTARY TRACK EVER, even better than the classic Henry Hill commentary from the special edition of Goodfellas.  Too many director commentaries wind up dwelling excessively on the technical aspects of the movies, but obviously there's no concern about that here, as the two actors seem intent on just having a good time.  The tone of the commentary is mock pretentious and consistently self-deprecating, as Giamatti and Church spend two hours making high-toned allusions and ripping on themselves as well as occasionally talking about the movie.  At some points it's even funnier than the movie itself, which is saying something.  Not to mention, it reveals that Paul Giamatti is the son of none other than A. Bartlett Giamatti, the late former commissioner of Major League Baseball best known for banning Pete Rose, one of those little-known facts that are always nice to find out when watching a DVD.  Oh and of course, it goes without saying that you should pick up the widescreen edition, as the transfer you get with it is decidedly excellent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Batman" is a modern classic of the superhero film genre"></head><body><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />"Batman," director Tim Burton's 1989 film, is a modern classic of its genre and is arguably the original standard-bearing film in the "Batman" filmography.  Starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, it redefined the character after decades of prominence for the more campy Adam West TV series and movie.<br /><br />The screenplay is extremely sharp, as a whole yielding an involved, relatively deep story which draws a compelling connection between Batman and The Joker, and gives each character a considerable amount of depth. Both Mr. Keaton and Mr. Nicholson offer exceptional performances in giving, for the time, the definitive portrayals of their respective characters.  There are also a wealth of one-liners throughout the script which reveal the characters in witty, pointed fashion.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also exceptional; from Michael Gough appearing in the first of four "Batman" films as Alfred, Bruce Wayne's butler and closest confidante, to Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, ace reporter and increasingly mystified girlfriend to Bruce Wayne.  Billy Dee Williams also appears as idealistic District Attorney Harvey Dent.<br /><br />Also featuring a classic dramatic score by Danny Elfman, "Batman" is highly recommended as both a companion piece to Christopher Nolan's great "Batman" films, and is a towering classic of the superhero film genre in its own right.</p></body></html>

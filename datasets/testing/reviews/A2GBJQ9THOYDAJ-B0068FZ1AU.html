Gimme a break.) But my wife wanted to see it so I joined her. And I have to say I was more or less pleasantly surprised. No one had told me this was the "ABBA musical." The plot, as befits a musical, is pretty simple. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), daughter of an American hotel-owner on one of the Greek islands, is about to be married. Her mother, Donna (Streep), was a hippie chick back in her youth, sleeping with whomever she liked whenever she pleased, and when she got pregnant her own parents barred her from returning. She's not even sure which of three different guys is the baby's father. But Sophie has found mama's diary and culled the three names, and has invited all three now middle-aged potential fathers to the wedding. So Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgaard turn up and the games begin. It's all lighthearted and fun, but the real enjoyment for me was in the fact that every single number is an old ABBA tune, from "Chiquita" and "Slipping through My Fingers" through the boisterous production number, "Dancing Queen." It's also a relief to know that even I am a better singer than Pierce Brosnan. There's not a lot of the actor-character chemistry necessary to hold a successful musical together (think John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John), but it's worth watching for the music. Once, anyway.</p></body></html>

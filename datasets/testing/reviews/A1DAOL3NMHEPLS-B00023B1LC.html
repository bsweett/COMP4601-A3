<meta name="summary" content="Lots of action, but strangely unmoving"></head><body><p>My wife and I watched this on DVD. We were disappointed that it was available only in &quot;full screen&quot; format -- i.e. with the edges chopped off -- but decided to view it anyhow. She liked it more than I did.  The premise is intriguing, but its potential is not realized. After a while I didn't really CARE who Bourne is, or was. Matt Damon's acting is wooden, and the endless chase-fight-escape sequences just aren't believable. At one point, I half expected the big secret to be that Bourne is a cyborg, or specially enchanced human (a la &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;) as this is the only plausible explanation for his invincibility. But no, he's just a man. Overall, it's not a bad movie; it's just not very good either.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spidey's better"></head><body><p>After X-Men blew everyone away by actually being GOOD, movie rights to comic books started popping up all over the place. It was like after Survivor, one after another a new reality show came out and it's still going. Then came a very good adaption of Spiderman. Then came this. Well this...eh.<p>Matt Murdock is 12 or so with a prize boxer fighter of a dad. After witnessing something a bit troubling that his dad is doing, he runs off and gets blinded by toxic. Only instead of being permanently blinded, his other 4 senses actually are heightened and his vision becomes like a radar using sound. In one scene, a train makes his vision go all screwy, a simple tap on some bars creates a wave which &quot;clears&quot; the vision and keeps it normal.<p>Murdock now grown up, is getting a bad name on the streets and also meets the gorgeous Elektra, the daughter of a wealthy tycoon. Due to some bad timing, Elektra sees Daredevil escaping, thinking he killed her father. Not only dealing with Elektra's revenge, he must tend with Bullseye, a psychotic who has extreme accuracy with anything he throws, and Kingpin, the head honcho and a massive man.<p>After watching this film, I didn't really have desire to watch it again, unlike the first 2 Batman's or Spiderman. Despite some fine acting(and very good looks) from Jennifer Garner and a very nice job from Colin Farrell and a rather surprisingly good Ben Affleck, watch this once</p></body></html>

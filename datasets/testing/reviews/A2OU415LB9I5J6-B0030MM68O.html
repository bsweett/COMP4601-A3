<meta name="summary" content="The Hurt Locker"></head><body><p>A frontrunner for the Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards, The Hurt Locker deals with a bomb defusing squad on the field in Iraq. When SSG Thompson (Guy Pearce) is killed when a bomb he is trying to defuse is set off, he is replaced as team leader by SFC James (Jeremy Renner). Things don't quite work out the way the other members of the squad, Sgt Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), would like as James is an adrenaline junkie who's prone to not listen to anyone around him. As time goes on he detaches himself further from them, and leads them increasingly into more dangerous situations.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow, ex-wife of James "King of the World" Cameron, is a woman who has never rested on her laurels. Each time she steps up to a plate to make a movie she makes something completely different. With Near Dark she hit up horror, with Blue Steel she played with the thriller genre, Point Break took on the action genre, and Strange Days took on sci-fi. Having not made a movie since 2002's K-19: The Widowmaker, Bigelow was looking for a new project. She was trying to determine what movie to make when she sent this script to James Cameron who told her to make this movie. Now Bigelow sits as the front runner for Best Director, only the fourth woman in the history of the Academy to receive a nomination, and may possibly even best her ex-husband for the statuette.<br /><br />One of the things that stands out about this film, is that it's a war film that doesn't focus on the idea of whether war is right or wrong, whether or not we should be in Iraq, or if our soldiers are doing good things over there. With a job like bomb defusing, one of the great things, is that you're trying to make a safer environment for both your soldiers as well as the inhabitants that reside in the country you're fighting in. Picking this type of job is a masterful stroke, it allows Bigelow to stay out of politics and focus on the true message of the movie: War is a drug. The main character is a junkie, an adrenaline junkie. More and more he refuses to listen to those around him, and seeks bigger and bigger highs.<br /><br />Really, The Hurt Locker is an excellent character study of how war affects people differently, like drugs, and this war as a drug metaphor is one of the most brilliant things to come from movies based on wars in the past decade or more. On top of that, for an action movie made from only $15 million (that's half the budget of District 9) this movie still looks better than action movies made for over $100 million, with much more to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, filmed in a style reminiscent of a documentary the film has a certain real life feel to it, like rather than directing actors Bigelow directed a film crew tagging along with soldiers. Unlike many filmmakers these days, Bigelow really knows how to work suspense. Large portions of scenes are waiting for something bad to happen, and you really feel at any moment anyone could die. In a sniper face off, you sit with James and Sanborn on a ridge watching a building kilometers away, worried for your protagonists and hoping that they'll pull of the right shot. The movie doesn't include as much action as you'd expect, but because of the high suspense of the film you feel there's much more action in the film than there really is.<br /><br />The acting in this film is superb, as can be noted by Jeremy Renner's Oscar nomination. But, in reality, this cast deserved the SAG ensemble nomination they didn't get. While Renner's role doesn't stand out as the "addict" really everyone does such a great job that you honestly feel this could be a documentary where each of these actors aren't actors, but actual soldiers in the field. Of all the things that stand out, there's a great scene that comes later on in the movie, where Renner's SFC James has to diffuse a bomb strapped to a man who's pleading for his life. It's an extremely suspenseful scene that is also touching as James tries to come up with anything he can to free the man from his burden, and the acting in a scene like that is what makes it so suspenseful as you care for these individuals because of their actions and the way that they carry themselves.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Hurt Locker, definitely one of the best movies of 2009, and one that definitely landed on my top 5 list for that year. If you like war films, suspense, action, drama, and/or a good character study this is definitely one to check out. I know I'll be owning it!<br /><br />5/5</p></body></html>

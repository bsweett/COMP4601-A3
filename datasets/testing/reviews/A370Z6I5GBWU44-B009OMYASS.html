You have these college kids going somewhere really, really secluded (not the best idea in a foreign country, but hey, many guys will do anything for a 'experience'. The deteriorating conditions were also interesting to watch (ex, one guy disappears, and the hostel manager is trying to cover up, etc etc)<br /><br />The gang of kids was a bit much for me, but it was nice how in the end they helped the sole survivor of the hostel escape, and I also liked how he was resourceful enough to escape the Hostel and take his time, instead of just running out of there screaming. I couldn't imagine laying under a bunch of dead bodies and waiting patiently for a opening to escape, and it was also fitting how he exacted vengeance on the people who were instrumental in luring him and his friends there, though I felt really bad for Kana.<br /><br />My reason for the rating is the sheer gore of it all. This movie would have been more effective if they would have toned down the core a bit, since it was difficult to watch and I often turned away when something was being cut off/away. Overall a solid horror flick, though definitely not for the weak of stomach, be prepared to see lots of blood and mutiliation. 3.5/5 stars.</p></body></html>

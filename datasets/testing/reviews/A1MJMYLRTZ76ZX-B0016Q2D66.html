<meta name="summary" content="Interesting parallels"></head><body><p>As many people have already commented on the aspects of this film, I thought I would make a few comments on an interesting parallel I just became aware of in regard to another movie.<br /><br />Oddly enough, within 24 hours I saw both "The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit," a flick from 1956, and this movie, and they're both so similar that one wonders if the novel this movie was based on was in some way influenced by the 50s novel and subsequent movie. In both movies the couples (played by Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones in the earlier flick) face the same struggle between security and conformity, the desire to escape a constricting life, and the need to excel and stand out in some way from the herd.<br /><br />Peck is a successful advertising executive who is haunted by flashbacks from the war, but who has married, started a family, and managed to successfully balance family with career, despite his own reservations about the personal compromises he must make at work. The wife isn't happy with those compromises, always wanting Peck to stand up for his own ideas and be more independent, despite the fact that this would almost certainly put his job security in jeopardy. But like the Winslett character in this film, she wants a different husband and some ways a different life, although not to the extent of her husband quitting and then gallivanting off to Paris.<br /><br />In this film, again, we have a young couple who want a freer, more alive, more independent life, free from the dull, drab, boring sameness of 50s middle-class life and its strictures and conventions. The difference between this couple and Peck and Jones is that they do indeed at least initially decide to chuck the comfortable middle class life they've set up and move to Europe. But circumstances intervene, and so they're both left with the earlier unhappy compromises that they were trying to break free of--with resulting disastrous consequences for their marriage--whereas in the 50's flick eventually everything works out in the end.<br /><br />Another interesting parallel is that both men have (although under very different circumstances) romantic dalliances outside of their marriage. In Peck's case, it was during the war when he thought he might die any day, never to see his wife again. In the present movie it's a less forgivable dalliance since it occurs with another woman in the office.<br /><br />Overall a well done movie about a couple who just weren't meant for each other and with interesting parallels to another movie from over 50 years ago.</p></body></html>

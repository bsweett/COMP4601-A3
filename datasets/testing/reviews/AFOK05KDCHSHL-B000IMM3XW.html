Against all the odds, the final product (based on a long-running Marvel comic series developed by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Chris Claremont and Len Wein) demonstrates a profound maturity that lifts it head and shoulders above the massed ranks of mechanical Hollywood blockbusters, whilst simultaneously delivering the kind of effects-heavy spectacle that audiences have come to expect from this particular sub-genre.<br /><br />Whilst bigoted politicians are fomenting unreasoning hostility toward a new breed of superhuman 'mutants' - ordinary people with extraordinary powers including telepathy, pschokinesis and/or mind control, representing the next stage in human evolution - a benevolent psychic named Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has established a private school where he teaches particularly gifted mutants to channel their abilities safely. But some of his most powerful students - played with earnest conviction by a number of Hollywood's sexiest rising stars, including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and James Marsden - are called upon to challenge the wrath of Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant supervillain whose hatred of mankind was cultivated in a Nazi concentration camp (outlined in a harrowing opening sequence, where the film's sober intentions are signalled in no uncertain terms), and who is determined to launch a devastating assualt on the world's non-mutant population, igniting a war between the species that only the mutants can win.<br /><br />The unusually clever scenario provides an almost entirely character-driven rationale for its flashy set-pieces, without skimping on either aspect of the production. That's due partly to David Hayter's concise script, Singer's ingenious ability to convey a wealth of relevant information at high speed without rushing or obscuring the details, and a strict adherence to the film's primary thematic concerns (tolerance, individuality, finding your own place in the world, etc.). The performances, too, are uniformly excellent: Stewart and McKellen may seem unlikely adversaries, but these immensely gifted actors elevate the proceedings beyond the confines of mere 'Good and Evil', adding real depth and nuance to their respective characters. The younger members of the X-Men team are somewhat underused, but they certainly LOOK spectacular and they make the most of their limited screen time, while Ray Park (Darth Maul himself!), model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and wrestler Tyler Mane also provide visual fireworks as Magneto's villainous henchmen.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) provides the film's emotional core as a young girl targeted by Magneto because of her unique powers, while Jackman takes center-stage in a star-making role as the most reluctant recruit to Stewart's team of superheroes (his verbal conflicts with rival Marsden are often joyously funny). Production values are predictably solid, betraying little or no evidence of a rushed production schedule: Newton Thomas Sigel's Panavision photography conspires with John Myhre's astute production design to render a silver-blue color scheme that subtly emphasizes the movie's comic-book origins, reflected in the DVD's similarly-styled packaging.<br /><br />While Singer insists the movie's subtext is critical of all forms of intolerance, closer scrutiny suggests more specific concerns about homophobia, the only form of prejudice which remains openly condoned throughout society. Bruce Davison (LONGTIME COMPANION) plays a rabble-rousing politician who frightens Congress with exaggerated 'scare-stories' about a sub-culture they don't understand, while hate-filled protestors gather on the steps outside to wave placards that condemn the 'infiltration' of mutants into schools, churches and society at large. Sound familiar? These themes are further underlined in a Fox TV special included on the original DVD release, constructed as a series of news reports surrounding Congressional hearings on a proposed Mutant Registration Act, wherein Davison holds court with almost religious fervor, spitefully twisting the evidence to suit his own rhetoric, only to be laid low by an amusing final twist that mirrors the downfall of many a similar real-life politician. This particular interpretation may not have been the central focus of the original comic strip, but Singer's intentions are so conspicuous, and so heartfelt, it's a miracle (and, frankly, a blessing) that he was able to get away with it at all. Is this the world's first $70 million dollar 'gay' movie? Not quite, but it certainly provides plenty of food for thought...<br /><br />Followed by X2 (2003).</p></body></html>

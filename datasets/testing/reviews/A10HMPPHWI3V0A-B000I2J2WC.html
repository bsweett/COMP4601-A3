<meta name="summary" content="Ron Howard's Adaptation of Dan Brown's "Da Vinci " practices in Mediocracy"></head><body><p>I am going to start out by noting that Ron Howard is one of the best directors of our modern generation,... that is why that I thought, going into the theatre that this film (staring one of the best actors ever), ... would have at least a sliver of a chance of being good, .... maybe not as good as the book but nonetheless still good. Making a film of such a loved as well as heated topic always draws alot of attention, there is always the people that love andmost of the time ... that same number of people that hate.<br /><br />It was a very smart summer blockbuster that wll attract alot of the general american public, think about it ... Tom Hanks (one of the best actors we have ever had AND it's based on one of the most read books since well h*l*, the BIBLE and .... the DICTIONARY. Ron Howard's adaptation of the Da Vinci Code, in my opinion not only falls sort of the book but also tacks on a completley new and UN-improved boring ending, I honestly was somewhat enjoying this film right upuntilthe final 30 minutes, it was pointless, uncalled for and just all around sloppy and .... bad.<br /><br />Now getting all of those negetive statements out of the way,.... I very much enjoyed the way that they adapted the screenplay (other than the end, obviously),and I loved the acting all around as a whole. That said Tom Hanks, obviously wasnt exactly the most convincing Robert Langdon but still his natural acting skills made up for it. Ian McKellen's performance of Sir Leigh Teabing is jut about as good as it could have been nd the French actress Audrey Tautou's performace as Sophie was well done.Even the little performances such as Jean eno's performance as the police chief was good just as the rest of eno's performances. Also the cinamotography and camera shots were ver well done and were definatly pleasing towatch and keep an eye on<br /><br />The "Da Vinci Code"  has it's shining moments but fails, overall to really impress not only non-readers of thenovelbut alsothe devoted fans, but i'm not too shocked..... if I was you I would gofor myself and see,....... as if you were'nt anyways<br /><br />Grade: C+</p></body></html>

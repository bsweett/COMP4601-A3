<meta name="summary" content="do you need the parental guidance to experience cruelty & brutality?"></head><body><p>if you gave this film one star, it only means that you don't have the stomach for cruelty that only human being could have achieved; and it also means that you often watching movies with your own moral standard and values. watching movies doesn't need you to take them too personal. you just have to know how we human beings are capable of doing evil and good things. either way is by your own choice, just like to eat or not to eat the grapes, it's your own choice and decision, and you have to deal with the consequences.<br /><br />i don't know how to categorize this movie, but i could still appreciate it in certain ways about its seriousness, sincerity and profoundness. it's only for the open-minded adult viewers, allowing them an opportunity to remember their own childhood, their imagination, their fears of the unknown future, ghost, death, poverty, sometimes even loneliness.<br /><br />the creation of that captain in this movie is one of the most fearsome heartless stone-cold killers, using cruelty and brutality to show their bravery.<br /><br />i can't say this movie is visually stunning or beautiful, because most of the time it's too graphically and unnecessarily dark, gruesome and gross. but if judge with the standard of good or bad movie, it's definitely a good one. screenplay, acting, directing all very good.</p></body></html>

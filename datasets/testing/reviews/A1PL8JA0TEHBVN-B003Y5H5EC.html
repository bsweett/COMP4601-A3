<meta name="summary" content="HOW TO USE A BIG IDEA ON A SMALL BUDGET."></head><body><p>The story is simple:<br /><br />An innocent looking 14 year old girl meets an older photographer on the internet and agrees to go to his house. It looks like he is the child molester and she his next helpless victim. But think again... this girl is the big bad wolf!!!<br /><br />Everything on this film is great. The story, the actors, the setting, dialogs, etc...<br /><br />It is worth every penny to see that old Hitchcockian clich&eacute; (few characters closed inside a small place) working so well.<br /><br />The weaker part (for me) is the ending. I found it predictable and a little contrived - that's why I take one star out.<br /><br />But even if you agree with me, this film is still a winner in many many ways... The cast is a joy to watch. Ellen Page gives a stunning performance. She is a powerhouse actress... see it because she is unbelievable!!!<br /><br />This film is, in fact, a great lesson on how do you make a great film with very little means and lots of talent and imagination.<br /><br />It has also a heavy subject and some strong/violent content that you must see before recomending.<br /><br />I'm happy I cought it on the movie theatre. And i must say I was impressed and surprised by the film's best qualities - that overshadowed its shortcomings.<br /><br />A strong film to be discovered on DVD.<br /><br />I love Sandra Oh... I wish her part was bigger.</p></body></html>

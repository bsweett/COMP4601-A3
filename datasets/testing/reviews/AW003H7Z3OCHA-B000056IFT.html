The movie is the main ingredient/bottom line to all this equipment! Being a videophile I am obsessed in getting the best quality picture and sound available! So my reviews will concentrate on the total DVD package.<br />TOTAL RECALL is my (#2nd) Home Theatre DVD Review. This is the movie's second release and the first was fair but they got it right on this &quot;Special Limited Edition&quot;.<br />Now this DVD is Digitally ReMastered (Picture &amp; Sound). It is enhanced for Widescreen (16:9 Aspect Ratio) TV's &amp; HDTV's. The movies picture is one of the best (sharpest clarity) I've ever seen on home DVD. NOTE: 480p = 480 horizontal lines (Digital) of Progressive Scan (p) - which is basically a line doubler and using COMPONENT VIDEO cable for the best picture quality. Regular DVD players have 480i = 480 horizontal lines (Analog) and use either COMPOSITE or S-VIDEO Cables. For more information see my SD-6200 &amp; MV3CV-2M reviews.<br />Simply put this is a scifi Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie of the highest quality (special effects, story line, casting &amp; color). He is caught between a boring life and the strange desire to be an action hero on Mars. He sees a TV ad referring to a brain implant journey to Mars. This is the latest Travel scheme fad of the time. A mental exercise in time and space. (pretty clever huh?) The name of the company is &quot;Rekall&quot;. This is just the beginning of a great DVD journey!!!! (Parental Guidance required - some graphic violence and mutant make-up).<br />The colors are absolutely beautiful, so vivid. The Sound is so crystal clear. (5.1)<br />Extras are abundant and delightful including a Commentary Track with Schwarzeneggers many fond memories. This DVD is a great value and total eye &amp; ear candy!!!!</p></body></html>

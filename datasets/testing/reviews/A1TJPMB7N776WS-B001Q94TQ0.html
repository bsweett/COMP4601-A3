<meta name="summary" content="Pot Of Gold"></head><body><p>Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is a small town Colombiana with a major league 'tude: she knows what she was born into but also knows she doesn't like it and strives, and more to the point, craves for more. One day she is approached by someone who can set her up as a Mula: a courier who swallows rubber capsules of drugs and smuggles them into the USA and hopefully earn some big bucks in the process. But what Maria doesn't bargain for is that she will find more than a bucket of money at the end of the rainbow in the borough of Queens in NYC, USA.<br />MARIA FULL OF GRACE is a subtle, audaciously well directed (by Joshua Marston) film about what happens when you get what you wish for and ultimately regret having wished for it in the first place. This is Moreno's first film and she is heartbreakingly beautiful and touching as Maria. She is dark, sexy and quietly sensual: the kind of woman who is not aware of her powers, yet wields them nonetheless.<br />Director Marston has made a film of uncommon grace and intelligence. Don't come to this film looking for a glossed over, sugar coated story, you will not find it. What you will find is the ugly and the real told in a manner that can only be described as beautiful yet painstakingly blunt.</p></body></html>

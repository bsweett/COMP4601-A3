Now, getting past that, the story was an awesome blend of traditional sci-fi pulp and modern story-telling.  The complexity of the story did not transfer well to the big screen, however.  This would probably have been a bigger cult hit if it had been shipped direct to dvd and not exposed to the simple minds of most reviewers.  Not the typical Hollywood schlock...which accounts for the negative press.  Die hard MNS fans will appreciate the story...others will get lost.</p></body></html>

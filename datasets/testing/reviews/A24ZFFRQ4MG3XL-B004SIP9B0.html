She does a brilliant job and sometimes you almost can't believe that she isn't the real Queen.  Tony Blair was also really well cast and the actor did a fantastic job in looks and voice.<br /><br />It doesn't always show the Queen in good light.  She made some poor decisions after Diana's death.  She took her sweet time in addressing the public and she didn't lower the flag at the Palace among other things.  It shows some real footage from news bulletins and a little of the funeral prossesion and it kept William and Harry away from the spotlight (therefore keeping some of their privacy).<br /><br />There is fantastic acting in this and one thing I really liked about this is that it gives you a semi real glimpse into the mysterious life of a bizzare family and what happened behind the scenes after the death of their former daughter-in-law, wife and mother.  I really liked it and I was glad to finally get around to watching it yesterday.  I can't believe it took me so long.  I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

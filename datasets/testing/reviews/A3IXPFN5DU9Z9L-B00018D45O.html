<meta name="summary" content="Tense and Foreboding - It's the Atmosphere that Makes this Remake"></head><body><p>This remake of TCM doesn't really add anything new to the horror genre, nor is it necessarily an improvement when compared with the original, but when viewed without any expectations it makes for a solid thriller.<br /><br />The formula is pretty standard: Pretty kids get shredded in creative ways by a gruesome killer. What I liked most about this film is the well crafted atmosphere of isolation and decrepitude. The environs of the forgotten little southern town where all this takes place are creepy yet believable, albeit in a "all southerners are inbred crazies" sort of way.<br /><br />The film contains enough gore but doesn't go over-the-top, and it's clever enough to keep leatherface at least partially concealed for the majority of the film. They also made the good call of casting Jessica Biel, who's tight fitting white tee is frequently wet.<br /><br />The DVD has limited extras - Some TV spots and trailers and a music video by some heavy metal band. Dolby 5.1 is available. I recommend this version if you're into horror movies and not emotionally attached to the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Quality Romance"></head><body><p>&quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot;, starring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, is a great comedy release of 2003.  Its plot of a playright whose daughter falls in love with an older man, then later develops a relationship of her own with him, is great.  It has many creative hilarious scenes that keep audiences interested.  It gives new meaning of romance after age fifty.  The other added details, namely the characters' past, gives it the additional unique flavor.  Such interesting chain of events keep audience watching closely, always wondering what will happen next, especially through the numerous surprises.  Though a few scenes are unnecessarily repetative, audiences will never forget this.  Diane Keaton's Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated performance is outstanding.  Her presence alone gives the film the added viewing pleasure.  Her own sense of drama and humor is clearly pleasant.  Jack Nicholson is outstanding as he always is.  He proves that he plays the best characters the audiences love to hate.  This film is no exception.  All other actors, especially Amanda Peet, Frances McDormand, and Keanu Reeves, also offer quality performance.  &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; is a great romantic comedy for all ages to enjoy.  This is sure to please audiences for a long time.</p></body></html>

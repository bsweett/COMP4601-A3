<meta name="summary" content="You Don't Have To Be A Sandler Fan To Like This Movie"></head><body><p>This is a great story about two families with completely different ethnic backgrounds living in one house and learning how to get along and become close friends. You have the successful restaurant chef (Sandler) who was named best cook in America, and you have his newly hired maid who has a young daughter both from Mexico who moves in with Sandler's family.<br /><br />The cast and story is great with a somewhat sad ending. This a great film to watch even if you're not a fan of Adam Sandler.</p></body></html>

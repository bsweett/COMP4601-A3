Miles is a hapless writer struggling to overcome a breakup with an old flame and Jack is every woman's worst nightmare...that really stupid, overly sexy man who lies like a fiend! The friends end up going for a tour of wineries, Miles is obsessed with Pinot Grigio and Jack with sex. As they spend a week together things start to unravel because of lost dreams, new lives and selfish indulgences that lead to broken hearts along the way. The boys meet a couple of bright and wonderful women who add to the fiasco. A waitress (Virginia Madsen) coming to terms with a divorce and a new way of life describes wine as only a true poet can. While a wild and exuberant wine pourer (Sandra Oh) indulges herself in more than one area. So it is a week of laughter, disappointment, rage and discovery for all the parties involved. But the wine is the true star!<br /><br />This film is written lyrically and it flows like the wine which remains its sub-textural subject. It deals with the complexities of relationships the same way that wineries deal with their crops, some are quick and tart while others have to sit before they build their full bouquets. The acting is phenomenal offering both comic and emotional depth in each of the characters. Madsen is luminous and has the best lines; her character probably the best soul. Giamatti is subtle yet hilarious as the unconfident man with a heart of gold. Church makes women swoon and then cringe but he also makes viewers laugh out loud. And Sandra Oh has the best revenge scene ever filmed....you go girl! Together the blend has an essence of vanilla, a touch of oak and absolutely no horrible aftertaste because it is aged and cared for just like a fine body of wine shelved sideways.</p></body></html>

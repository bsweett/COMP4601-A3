<meta name="summary" content="Kate Beckinsale and crew does the original one better..."></head><body><p>The start of the new year is usually pretty slow when it comes to big films. Most of the time its when films not deemed summer blockbuster or holiday season worthy get scheduled for release. Len Wiseman's Underworld: Evolution is a step up from most of the garbage and fillers that end up being shown in January. This sequel to the Kate Beckinsale's 2003 gothic-actioner continues where the first film left off but with the increase in budget and less of an introductory feel to the characters. The film ends up looking quite good with action sequences that tops the first film and actually provides a story that adds to the mythology created in the first one.<br /><br />Right from the beginning with its vampire knights and rabid, peasant werewolves, Underworld: Evolution shows that the film will be more rollercoaster ride than a study in character and themes. This is a good thing and Wiseman doesn't try to deviate from this formula. He knows just exactly what his films trying to do and doesn't try to overanalyze the situations. The production design still has the European look to it from the sets and location (coincidentally set in Eastern Europe) to the costume and prop designs. The film also makes heavy use of blue-filters to give the film that industrial look. Sometimes the sequences even takes on the look of a crisp, black and white film when the action is set at night with minimal light.<br /><br />The story continues the struggle between the vampire clans and the lycan rebels from the first film. This time around Selene and the lycan hybrid, Michael are hunted by both sides as they struggle to search for the answers to their questions about Viktor's (Selene's vampire primogenitor and one of the clan elders) betrayal of her trust and the shared past of both vampire and lycan clans. Wiseman and McBride (the film's co-writer with Wiseman) do a good job in summarizing the basic plot points from the first film through dream-like sequences whenever blood is drank by the last surviving elder (Marcus as played by genre veteran Tony Curran). One doesn't need to see the first film to get the gist of what's going on in this sequel, but it'll still help if one had some knowledge going in. What i found particularly intriguing was the past history of Marcus and how his past tied in with Viktor's, Selene and in the end that of Michael's. An even older character than Marcus makes an appearance that helps tie the two films together.<br /><br />The cast itself did an adequate to admirable job in doing their parts. Thankfully, Wiseman limited Scott Speedman's scene time with dialogue to a minimum. Speedman pretty much spends most of the film in his hybrid form and performing fight scenes. I consider this decision a major plus for the film. Sir Derek Jacobi adds abit of gravitas to the film as an elder, behind-the-scenes manipulator or the two clans. But in the end the film is all about Kate Beckinsale and she's never looked better. She delviers her lines with enough conviction to make them believable, but at the same time shows just how much she's having. It didn't hurt the film that she again gets to parade around in black, tight leather and latex and in one sequence pretty much nothing. She also does a pretty convincing job of being a kick-ass action heroine. I wouldn't mind it if she took on an action-film here and there to supplement her more serious works.<br /><br />The action scenes were better than the first film, but not so over-the-top that they go from cool to cartoonish like most action-film sequels. The effects work was more polished and this could be due to a higher budget and a better FX crew. The shapechanging from human to lycan was done much better and had less of the computer-generated look to them. The climactic showdown in the end with Selene was action-packed and well-done for a film that was pretty much dumped by Sony Pictures in the graveyard of the film season. This climactic showdown had the audience cheering the most and deservingly so.<br /><br />In the end, Underworld: Evolution was a very entertaining sequel that didn't try to go beyond its gothic-action film pedigree. I could see this series continue to become a trilogy if Wiseman and McBride have more stories to tell about the vampire clans, the lycans, and Selene. The two films are similar to Snipes Blade trilogy, but this time sexier and with abit more an engaging story than the Daywalker series. The film wasn't anything to write to the Academy voters but it did its job in entertaining the audience. 7.5/10</p></body></html>

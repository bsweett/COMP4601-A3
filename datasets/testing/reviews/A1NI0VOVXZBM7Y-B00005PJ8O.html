<meta name="summary" content="Patton."></head><body><p>Beautiful,Patriotic and well done. George C. Scott did A Great Service. Patton should be viewed by my generation, A Great Movie about a Great General,A Great Man. Most War Movies focus toO much on silly false pretenses and the liberal anti-war message instead of focusing on what is real and sometimes inevitable. Patton is One of If not THE BEST War Movie in my Opinion I have seen.HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</p></body></html>

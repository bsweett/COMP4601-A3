I suppose all of the trendy dialogue and often unnecessary indie credibility made me want to target this as among the most overrated films of 2007.  In retrospect I hate when I have preconceptions going into a film but at least here I can admit its impact.  Juno isn't overrated at all and although the dialogue is still hard to believe in flashes; the characters were compelling, enjoyable, and very easy to like.  It was a simple task to forgive the few flaws I expected to find.<br /><br />The film is directed by Jason Reitman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0MKOC">Thank You for Smoking</a>), the son of director Ivan Reitman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000060K4O">Ghostbusters</a>).  It is written by Diablo Cody, a known blogger who won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay for Juno.  The film's cast is actually very deep for its modest budget of $7 million dollars.  The cast includes Ellen Page in the title role, Michael Cera as her quasi-boyfriend and father-to-be, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the would-be adoptive parents of Juno's daughter, and J.K. Simmons as Juno's father, among others.  It always surprises me when J.K. Simmons appears in a role as a nice guy after seeing him play an imprisoned Aryan gang leader for years on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6BL42">Oz</a> and the fiery J. Jonah Jameson in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T82">Spider-Man movies</a>.  He is always an outstanding supporting actor.<br /><br />Juno follows a young girl named Juno MacGuff (Page) who discovers she is pregnant.  The film looks the issue of abortion right in the face, for better or worse, seemingly indifferent to the views of either side, and eventually Juno decides she will have the child and put it up for adoption.  Mark and Vanessa Loring (Bateman and Garner) are a married thirty-something couple that want to adopt the child.  Juno's interactions with both Mark and Vanessa are engaging and surprisingly fresh.  The supporting characters are very strong and make the main characters even more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The strength of Juno's character seems to be one of the film's contentious points.  Everyone seems to agree that Page is amazing in the role, and she is, but the way the character is written was something I expected to tackle as a flaw.  It isn't at all; she is a powerful, intelligent, and confident young woman who I found not only believable but completely original.  But there are many reasons to recommend Juno.  It's well-written, it contains some great performances, and it has a soundtrack and style I appreciated very much.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Good, but could've been better."></head><body><p>This is a very good movie, however, I'd have prefered it was more well-rounded. I was wondering why they did not delve into the signifigance and source of the blue war-paint and pre-war rituals that would have further defined the culture and belief systems of the clans during that period in history.<br />Instead, I was left feeling battle-weary and glad it was over.<br /><br />Costuming and sets were authentic looking, casting was good and Mel did a passable Scottish accent.  Cinematography was very good too.  Still, it could've been better.<br /><br />**Not for children</p></body></html>

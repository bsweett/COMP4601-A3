<meta name="summary" content=""Where Did The Magic Go?""></head><body><p>Shrek turned out to be a an unexpected hit when it was released in 2001 and expanding on the succes of the first one Dreamworks studio ultimatly made a sequel,the simply titled Shrek 2 wich was not only better at the box office than the previous but also better as a movie.Shrek The Third,the second sequel is somewhat lacking what the previous two movies in the franchise had,orginality.Yet it stills manages to keep young and old fans satisfied,as there is still plenty of the same humor that made the other Shrek films so good.I was pretty sure they could never top Shrek 2 and this third movie didn't.The plot and humor sadly aren't as good as they could and should have been,even if some parts are funny like Pinocchio and Gingerbread Man's parts.<br /><br />The plot for this third movie in the Shrek series,is with the death of Fiona's father King Harold,the king of Far Far Away,Shrek becomes the next king.The thing is he doesn't accept that responsability so he goes on quest to recruit the perfect king.His choice settles on a young boy named Arthur but before he can bring him to his throne,Far Far Away is being invaded by Prince Charming who beleves HE must be king and an army of villains.The execution of the script to the big screen was rather average,nothing really special except a thing or two that was funny but i think that after this rather disapointing third movie Shrek has miles ahead if they want to recover their former glory.For Dreamworks its pretty much "Well,as long as it gets us cash" situation but they should pay closer attention to Shrek 4 cause if that one turns out like the third things are going to get bad.<br /><br />The visuals are one thing that they have actually done better than Shrek 1 and 2.They look stunning for a 3D movie and can only get better in future Shrek movies,its good that they stuck with the same kind of visuals as well.Still i can't deny that i was disapointed when i walked out of the Movie Theather,it just wasn't the same thing than with the first two.Those where magical,histerical movies,filled with great moments that i still remember today.With this third instalment of the series i can't say it sucked but i can't say it was that great either.<br /><br />That said its still satisfying but just not up to par with the first two films in terms of appreciation.The soundtrack remains great as the others with some classic and new songs,notably Led Zeppelin's classic "Immigrant Song" wich was played during a part of the movie's commercial.Its nice that despite everything they still have the orginal voice actors after all that time.Have anyone else noticed how the camera is less on Shrek,Donkey and Puss than in previous movies?It also seems to be aimed at a younger audience than the first two,its more fart jokes and such.As a mature person i would have to stick with my rating and opinion and give it a three,if it is rated for a kid movie then it would get a five,if you have kids by all means buy it for them they will have a great time.Lets hope for the next Shrek movies they turn out better than "Shrek The Third".</p></body></html>

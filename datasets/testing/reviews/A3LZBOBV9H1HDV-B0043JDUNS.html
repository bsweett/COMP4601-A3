<meta name="summary" content=""Iron Man 2" is excellent!"></head><body><p>"Iron Man 2" is excellent! This is how the story goes: The world is aware that billionaire inventor Tony Stark is the armored Super Hero Iron Man. Under pressure from the government, the press and the public to share his technology with the military, Tony is unwilling to divulge the secrets behind the Iron Man armor because he fears the information will slip into the wrong hands. With Pepper Potts, and James "Rhodey" Rhodes at his side, Tony forges new alliances and confronts powerful new forces.<br /><br />The cast led by Robert Downey Jr. (impressive again as Tony Stark), Gwyneth Paltrow (as Pepper Potts), Don Cheadle (as Rhodey), Scarlett Johansson (as Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff), Sam Rockwell (as Justin Hammer), Mickey Rourke (as Ivan Vanko) & Samuel L.

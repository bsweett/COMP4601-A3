<meta name="summary" content="A sense of despair beneath a seemingly happy veneer"></head><body><p>Starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, this 2008 film is about a marriage in the 1950s.  It's a time of conformity, suburban living, stay-at-home mothers and a lot of smoking and drinking.  Directed by Sam Mendes, there is an edge to this film, and the viewer immediately senses the despair beneath the seemingly happy veneer that this couple puts forth.  There's tension throughout as DiCaprio is bored with his job and seeks solace in a meaningless affair.  In the meantime, Winslet is home with two children and her hopes of being an actress have been dashed with a mediocre performance in a local theatrical production.  The couple argues a lot and it is clear there is something missing from their marriage.<br /><br />And then one day Kate comes up with the idea of moving to Paris where she will support her husband as a secretary and he can "find himself".  Plans move ahead.  The neighbors are surprised and a bit jealous.  And the real estate agent, played by Kathy Bates, who has befriended the couple, brings her son, who has just been released from a mental institution where he has gone through electroshock treatments, into the couple's home for dinner.  Conflict ensues and he is the only one who voices some painful truths.<br /><br />This film made me uncomfortable, as it was intended to be.  However, I couldn't take my eyes from the screen because I was interested in knowing how it would all turn out.  Kate Winslet gave a remarkably wonderful performance.  But in my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio just can't act.  Whenever he was in a serious scene I just couldn't relate him to the character he was playing and I found myself thinking about his rather wooden performance.  I also find it interesting that the only actor who was nominated for an Academy Award from this film was Michael Shannon, who played the role of mentally unstable neighbor.<br /><br />Revolutionary Road is a good film.  I just wish they had chosen a better actor to play the role of the husband.</p></body></html>

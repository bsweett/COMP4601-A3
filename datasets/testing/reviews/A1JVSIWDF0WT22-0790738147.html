<meta name="summary" content="A KNOCKOUT !"></head><body><p>It took me several recomendations before I decided to take a look at this film. At first with reservations upon learning the leading roles belonged to a couple of unknown Aussies, one of them (early on) even gives the impression of being nothing but a wimp. Let's just say by the end that impression had changed more than a bit and when the police captain says "I wouldn't want to be him for all the whisky in Ireland" I was in total euphoria.<br /><br />The plot is so dense and there are so many speaking characters yet they are all perfectly cast and memorable.<br /><br />Rumor has it a new special edition is on the way, however, the DVD out there is hardly short on features, I specially like the Guy Pearce / Russell Crowe screen tests. It's hard to tell how Director Curtis Hanson saw their greatness under all that hair.<br /><br />One of the best movies I've ever seen. Period.</p></body></html>

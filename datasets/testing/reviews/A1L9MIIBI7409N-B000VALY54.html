<meta name="summary" content="Great Acting but A Little Self Indulgent..."></head><body><p>Well casted, well acted, well filmed, and almost well written - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang intrigued me and turned out to be what I expected it to be: a quaint, slightly offbeat dark detective comedy.  Nicely set up and compelling in the beginning - Downey and Kilmer make an unlikely but highly watchable duo.  Downey is spot on as ever, but it's Kilmer who shines.  Past the a-list, it's interesting to see Kilmer in different roles now.  The plot however, turned out to be more complicated than Robert Towne's Chinatown and several other mysteries combined, and that turns out to be the film's undoing.  We end up keeping up with it because of Downey's predicament, but ultimately this isn't quite an action, comedy or thriller but more of a headscratcher instead.  Worth watching mainly if you're either a Downey or Kilmer fan - or really desperate to watch Corbin Bernsen!</p></body></html>

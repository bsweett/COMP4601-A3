<meta name="summary" content="Charismatic performances...but a problem filled script."></head><body><p>LAST KING OF SCOTLAND suffers from some of the same problems as HOTEL RWANDA.  It is timid in its exploration of the atrocities committed by Idi Amin.  While I  have no interest in seeing horrible things happen to humans just for the sake of entertainment (I can watch HOSTEL if that's what interests me), I also feel that a true understanding of what Amin inflicted on his country is missing from this film.  The way  he's presented, he mostly seems like a charismatic but unstable leader, who become increasingly paranoid and blithely knocked off his inner-circle of advisors left and right.  He did do these things...but he inflicted so much more agony too.  If a viewer came to Idi Amin for the first time through this movie, they would wonder what much of the fuss is about.  It needs to show the SCALE of the horrors this man inflicted...just like HOTEL RWANDA needed to show us the true face of those atrocities.<br /><br />A movie like SCHINDLER'S LIST made the holocaust a personal story, but also showed the horrors on a broad scale.  LAST KING OF SCOTLAND could have done the same. (Although no doubt not as powerfully...that was Spielberg's finest effort, after all).<br /><br />But this disappointment aside, there is much to admire about this excellent film, starting WITH the charismatic performance by Forest Whitaker.  Whitaker is never less than compelling to watch.  We see many facets of Amin...from bold leader, to national hero, to simpering child, to loving father, to paranoid lunatic, to delusional monster.  Whitaker makes the man likeable for much of the film...which is important, because he is viewed mostly through the eyes of a young, white British doctor (James McAvoy) who is enticed to join Amin's inner circle.  If Whitaker played him as just a nut-case, why would McAvoy ever allow himself to become part of the "team?"  Whitaker has always been a very good actor, with a wide range.  But his Amin is the shining high point of his career thus far.  He digs into this character with great intensity...I doubt the sweat that's always beading on his face was created by the makeup team.  He looks like a guy always on the brink of exploding...whether in raucous laughter or frightening rage.<br /><br />The script hints at the horrible things Amin is up to...but Amin himself never references them.  He hides the truth from McAvoy...and thus from us.  We feel as though the good doctor is anxious to get away from Amin only because he fears for his own life...not because he's seen what is happening to the country of Uganda.  While Whitaker more than delivers on his responsibilities to present Amin as the dangerous tyrant he was...the script allows few opportunities to show what Amin DID.<br /><br />So McAvoy is sometimes left looking more mildly concerned than terrified and outraged.  Later in the film, he suffers a personal tragedy and this energizes him...but for a lot of the movie, I was wondering how in the world he was so oblivious.  McAvoy (ATONEMENT) is a charming and capable actor...but he comes across as a bit of a lightweight in comparison to Whitaker's booming presence.  But the way  his character was developed (and the doctor IS the lead role), there probably wouldn't be many actors who could have made the part as interesting as Amin.  (Although here's another problem with the script:  McAvoy's character is fictional, so part of me felt that the filmmakers were wary of showing the story through any point of view other than that of a white person.  So often the plight of minorities is depicted through the eyes of the white majority...MISSISSIPPI BURNING is the first example that pops to mind, but there are lots of others.)<br /><br />The film also offers a brief but lovely performance from Gillian Anderson, hair dyed blonde and skin deeply bronzed.  At first, I just enjoyed seeing how different she looked from Dana Scully...but ultimately I was captured by her quiet charisma.  Sadly, she is only in the first third or so of the film.<br /><br />The film also has beautiful cinematography.  The film stock was highly saturated, making the colors richer than real life.  This has the effect of conveying not only the beauty of the land, but the intense heat.<br /><br />Despite my problems with the way the script decided to tell this story, and with its assumption that we all remember the famous "Raid on Entebbe" that brought Amin to the world's attention...I still recommend the film highly.  Whitaker certainly gave a performance worthy of Oscar consideration, and the story we do get is fascinating.  I'm frustrated it wasn't more...but I very much was engaged in what we were given.<br /><br />This is the kind of film that will have folks hitting the internet for more information of Idi Amin.  That can't be a bad thing.</p></body></html>

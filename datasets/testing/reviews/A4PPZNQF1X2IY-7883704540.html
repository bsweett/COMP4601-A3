<meta name="summary" content="Could have been great, but just very good."></head><body><p>The movie is excellent overall.  A few points: 1) Way too long, needs a good 15-20 min of editing.  2)  Too many scenes are either dull, unneeded dialogue or silly racing around, without any jokes.  3) The lost son ploy was poorly designed, and could have been a surprise with a lot less explaining and head stratching. 4)  Too many starts and stops, the flow is messed up with poor editing and excessive length.  5) Overall, a fun and humorous story for all ages.  Well done.</p></body></html>

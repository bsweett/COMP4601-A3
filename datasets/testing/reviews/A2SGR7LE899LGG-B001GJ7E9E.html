<meta name="summary" content="Silly, unrealistic, shallow!"></head><body><p>This movie actually kept me interested up until the two main characters blew each others cover, after that it got sillier and sillier by the second. Classic Hollywood nonsense, obviously aimed to the eyecandy oriented viewers. There is no message here, there is nothing based on real life, there is only silliness after silliness. Overall: BORING and BADDDDDD!</p></body></html>

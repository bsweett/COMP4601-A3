<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely entertaining, inspirational, and moving!"></head><body><p>First of all, I was not a fan of Ray Charles' music, because I haven't listen to his work that much, but I liked his Diet Pepsi commercials. I had no idea that his life was so remarkably painful and inspirational. I also hesitated on seeing this movie at the cinemas, because I was not a fan of Jamie Foxx. After seeing him in this entertaining and emotionally impacting film, I trully admire his performance that is definitely the top five of the year! I don't know if the Oscar people think he's ready  for the gold or not, since it's his first nod. Even though he's very deserving to win, I have a feeling they are going to give it to Leo. My choice is either Jamie Foxx or the non-nominees including Jeff Bridges, Paul Giamatti, and Liam Neeson.<br /><br />This movie chronicles the life and career of Ray Charles Robinson, starting with his early days doing gigs at a small bar all the way to recording albums, and touring the country when he became increasingly successiful. It also covered his marriage, the affairs with the singers in the band and his fans. More importantly, we get to see flashbacks of his childhood when he was in Florida living in proverty with his mom and younger brother who accidently drown to death, and he felt guilty about it for many years. It was this traumatic event that propelled him to abuse cocain for many years, and it ultimately hurt his career and relationships. It took him some serious rehab time to recover from his addiction. He also learned to let go and forgive himself when his dead brother and mother came into his dreams during his recovery.<br /><br />We get to hear many of Ray's greatest hits throughout the film, and my favorites are Georgia On My Mind and Hit The Road Again. Ray's had a very hard life, and he's probably the most unlikely person to become a legendary musician, because of his upbringing and being a blind person since early childhood. So many obstacles and people wanted to take an advantage of his talent. That's why his life is so inspirational.<br /><br />I thought the actress who played Ray's mother was very outstanding compared with the other female leads. She should've gotten a Best Supporting Actress nomination.</p></body></html>

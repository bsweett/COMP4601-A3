You can't help but, feel sorry for this pathetic music movie.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is a great actor and a great director but, isn't good enough to save this diaster of a movie. The music in the movie plays at inapproiate times and hops around from scene to scene giving us no break in between. No doubt that Bobby Darrin was a great but this movie does not live up to the life and legacy of Bobby.<br /><br />It will be easily forgotten and makes you wonder what the producers were thinking... The songs are excellent and Spacey gives a great performance- but the melodramatic screenplay is what kills this movie. I found the movie somewhat bizaree and I only hope Spacey will give directing another try with a better movie next time around.<br /><br />But, Spacey CAN sing well- I think that's why he chose to do this movie-it's too bad that the movie can out the way it did...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still has its charms...but pretty disappointing"></head><body><p>After the brilliance of the first two films, the third is just disappointing.  The animation is outstanding, of course...far superior to most other CGI films coming out these days.  The voice work is quite good.  Even the idea for the plot...with Shrek running off to find young Arthur to fill the throne he himself doesn't want...is a decent skeleton.<br /><br />But the movie just isn't as funny!  There were some fairly long stretches where is realized, "Hey, I haven't laughed in quite a long time."  There are lots of chuckles of amused familiarity...it's always fun to see Puss in Boots do his big, sad-eyed bit.  The supporting roles of Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the pigs, etc. are fun.  But the film doesn't surprise or delight.  The first was so great because we'd never seen a film like it and the characters were so fresh and fun.  #2 simply stepped up the hilarity quotient (and added the brilliantly hilarious Antonio Banderas).  But #3 just misses.  At one point, Puss and Donkey exchange bodies.  Haven't we seen similar ideas before?  Didn't Donkey become a Stallion?<br /><br />Also, some of the jokes just weren't funny.  Playing "Live and Let Die" at the Frog King's funeral was weird...not funny.  The climactic battle between Charming and his gang vs. Shrek and his friends was not exciting, not funny and not visually interesting.  VERY anticlimatic.<br /><br />For me, the best scenes took place at Arthur's high-school...a very Hogwarts sort of establishment.  It poked fun at the Harry Potter stories, at "teen-clique" movies like MEAN GIRLS and at the Arthurian legend.<br /><br />But for a movie that took 3 years to make...it felt a little lazy.  I'll keep going to SHREK films for now...but I hope 4 picks it up again!!!</p></body></html>

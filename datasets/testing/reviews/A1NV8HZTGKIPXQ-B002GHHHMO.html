<meta name="summary" content=""What A Wonderful Day For An Exorcism....""></head><body><p>There are some movies made that go on to achieve epic like status and become permanently ingrained in people's psyches. This is one of those films. Author William Peter Blatty wrote the novel after he was inspired by a story when he was attending college. It was a story of a young 13 year old boy who was apparently possessed and the exorcism that took place to rid the boy of the evil force. His book became The Exorcist, and it was given the silver screen treatment. Director William Friedkin, hot off "The French Connection", was brought on to board to make the film. Ellen Burstyn stars as Chris MacNeil, a single movie actress with a 12 year old daughter named Reagan(Linda Blair). The two live in a nice Georgetown townhouse and all seems well. It isn't long that Reagan begins exhibiting strange and odd behavior and it is without any kind of explanation. The doctors bring the idea of an exorcism to Ms. MacNeil, to rid her daughter of whatever demonic force has taken hold of her. Enter Father Damien Karras(Jason Miller), a priest with his own troublems, including the questioning of his own faith. The brilliant Max Von Sydow is Father Merrin, an elderly man of the cloth is called upon to perform the exorcism. I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said. The film has an undeniable sense of fear and dread from the very beginning. It creates a disturbing feeling and image that crawls under your skin and stays there. The acting is teriffic. Sydow was only 44 when he did this, but you would really believe that he was 30 years or so older. Amazing. Linda Blair is fantastic as the put upon Reagan, and she won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar. Burstyn is really good. You really feel for her and believe that she is a woman who is quickly falling apart as her daughter is being ravaged by some force. Jason Miller brings a strong, intense presence to his role, and the camera eats him up in every scene. The film also boasts one of the finest scary soundtracks captured on film. "Tubular Bells" is chilling, haunting, and unforgettable. The make-up on little Reagan is some of the most chilling and frightening images caught on film. Her "episodes" and final exorcism are bone chilling and some of the most frightening and scariest pieces of film. Friedkin is someone who knows how to scare the crap out of people and he does it with a sure hand. There are a few scenes here that are classic and just those images will always be remembered and stand the test of time. I think a certain image of Father Merrin standing under that street light is the best. It's a shame that the film got a severe case of "Sequelitis". Part 2 is one of the worst films/sequels ever, but Part 3 was decent enough to watch. Make no mistake, nothing will ever erase the raw and powerful imagery and story of this film. Nothing. There is a reason this film is always at the top of every horror/scary movie list. It is that good, and yes, it is that downright scary.</p></body></html>

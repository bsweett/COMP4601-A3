The film focuses on the lives of three people and how they eventually intersect. Mat Damon plays a Clairvoyant who has been trying to leave that side of his life behind him, and there is a television journalist (Cecile de France) who has a near death experience, and then there is a young boy whose brother's death has left him feeling alone. This movie is less about what possibly happens after death than how people with a common interest and need come together to share their special bond. The main characters in this film seem isolated, and lonely, and alienated from those around them because of their particular unique experiences. In this way the film is really about how people connect in this life and bridge the gap between their various islands of experience.<br /><br />This film looks exceptionally good on blu-ray, and included with the special features is an 89 minute long documentary about Clint Eastwood and his career.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lovers Across Time in Entertaining Romance..."></head><body><p>While the concept of lovers from different eras is hardly new (Bing Crosby's love of Arthurian-era Rhonda Fleming in "A Connecticut Yankee", Tyrone Power falling for Ann Blyth in Revolutionary War England in "I'll Never Forget You", and Christopher Reeve's bittersweet affair with Gilded Age beauty Jane Seymour in "Somewhere in Time", are just a few examples), the novelty of 'fated' lovers separated by two years, bonding through letters in a magical mailbox, gives "The Lake House" a unique poignancy all it's own.<br /><br />Certainly, there are leaps of logic to contend with (Sandra Bullock could have easily have tracked down Keanu Reeves at any point, without protracting their rendezvous an additional two years, her relationship with her boyfriend is never resolved, nor is the fate of Jack, the dog, who simply disappears), but taken on it's own terms, the film is a very satisfying and romantic odyssey. Reeves and Bullock, who had a wonderful, goofy chemistry in "Speed", prove than they can handle a deeper, more mature screen relationship very well, with Reeves giving one of his best performances, and Bullock, whose career had stalled after "Miss Congeniality", proving again that she is underrated as a dramatic actress.<br /><br />Based on the 2000 Korean film, "Il Mare", screenwriter David Auburn has given the production a 'Classic Hollywood' luster, with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman's "Notorious" playing on TV, and an ill-fated rendezvous reminiscent of "An Affair to Remember"; the presence of veteran star Christopher Plummer as Reeves' father enhances the 'feel'. While some may find this approach 'old-fashioned', Argentine director Alejandro Agresti recognized that a classic romance needed a classic approach, and, in my opinion, it succeeds quite well!<br /><br />"The Lake House" certainly deserves a look!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Modern Parable On Power"></head><body><p>At just under four hours, this is a long film, but one that holds the viewer riveted. Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, comes back from World War II as a hero. His family are leading mobsters and it is a life he wants to reject, but his hand is forced when his father, Don Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is shot down in the street. Slowly and reluctantly, he gets sucked into the vortex of the Mob, proving himself every bit as ruthless as his rivals.<br /><br />This film reveals perfectly the analogy between 20th Century gangsters and the aristocracy. Not the effete aristocracy of the modern age but that of antiquity: when brutality and nobility went together; when power came from brute strength. This is what Thomas Paine had to say about the aristocracy:<br /><br />"It could have been no difficult thing....for a banditti of ruffians to overrun a country [and] their power being thus established, the chief of the band contrived to lose the name of Robber in that of monarch and hence the origin of Monarchy and Kings." 'The Rights of Man.'<br /><br />If Don Corleone had been born in the pre-democratic age, his descendants would now have lands and respectable titles. Don Corleone insists people call him Godfather: In a previous age it would have been King, Duke, Baron, or Prince. It all means the same. Splendour sits side by side with violence. There are no ethics, only power. Everything else is a fa?ade.<br /><br />This was made in the 70s, when Coppola made genuinely great films. It's a compelling story beautifully told. The pacing is steady but never slow. The performances are flawless: the cinematography beautiful. Come the 80s, his genius would desert him. However, his classic films are still around and show just how powerful a medium film can be. The Godfather is ample evidence of this. This is one of the great movies of the 20th Century.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An uncompelling and BORING movie...and NOT scary at all."></head><body><p>In "Dark Water", a mother and her little girl move into a terribly depressing apartment building in an attempt to build a life together.  The mother is caught in a custody battle for her little girl.  Strange things start happening in their apartment with the appearance of dark water.  A rather morbid mystery lies deep within the walls of this apartment building and the mother and her daughter get caught in the middle of it.<br /><br />Evidently, this is an American remake of the Japanese version of this film also called "Dark Water".  I saw some of the Japanese film and could not get into it.  Interestingly enough, I had a hard time getting into this version as well, but I did sit through it.  To say "Dark Water" is not scary would be an understatement.  Although the acting is decent, the atmosphere in "Dark Water", while certainly present, is largely ineffective at producing any horror or scares in the audience resulting in a totally uncompelling attempt at a horror movie.<br /><br />Some people may argue that "Dark Water" is more of a suspense/mystery movie (I agree) rather than a horror movie, but the movie comes off as incredibly boring and predictable in that regard as well.  The only thing that even raises an eyebrow is the ending, and even that was rather anti-climactic.  If you're interested in the suspense-thriller with some elements of horror, I recommend watching "The Ring" instead, which is clearly superior to "Dark Water" in every conceivable way.  To be perfectly frank, "Dark Water" is one boring movie for this horror movie lover...sorry, just didn't do it for me. Connelly does a decent job as the mother, but certainly not enough to save this watery mess.</p></body></html>

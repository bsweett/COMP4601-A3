<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing"></head><body><p>I consider myself a huge horror fan and I think "House of 1000 Corpses" is probably one of the worst horror movies, ever.<br /><br />In "House of 1000 Corpses", Jerry, Bill, Mary, and Denise take a trip to the American roads in order to collect material for a book about offbeat roadside attractions. At some point, Bill decides to stop at a gas station ran by an extremely weird man in a clown suit named Captain Spaulding. The place is very bizarre and tacky, but since Jerry and Bill live for that kind of rarities...they love the place!. Captain Spaulding nicely invites the two guys to take a look at the "murder ride". After finally managing to persuade the girls, the four friends take a look at the weird attraction. That's how they become aware of the local legend of Doctor Satan. A weird creature who devoted his entire life to experiment with people and turn them into monsters. Apparenly, Dr Satan was hung from a tree by a bunch angry villagers. That tree is not far away from the "murder ride". Obviously, Bill and Jerry insist Captain Spaulding on letting them know the way to that tree and he finally accedes. In the middle of the road, they pick up weird hitchhiker, a blonde girl named "Baby". The car breaks down all of a sudden, but Baby nicely offers some help and invites them to stay at her place while her brother fixes the car. Unfortunately, Baby and her family are a bunch of sadistic maniac who enjoy celebrating Halloween in a grotesque way.<br /><br />"House of 1000 Corpses" is nothing but a "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" rip-off.  The film is very disturbing as some scenes and images were defiantely very creepy. Its also very gory but that doesn't mean its scary. It also sometimes goes over the top on the gore.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A perfect match..."></head><body><p>I love Ridley Scott.  He is one of those directors who are capable of doing almost anything.  Sure, he has had some misfires in the past, and he will continue to have a few, but overall he has proven that he can sink into nearly any genre with ease and deliver something memorable.<br /><br />`Matchstick Men' is a light yet striking film that could stand tall with the best Scott has been able to produce.<br /><br />The film revolves around two con men, Roy and Frank, who find their operation flipped on its head with the sudden appearance of Angela.  This young teenager claims to be Roy's daughter.  This is news to him, but he learns to accept the possibility, and over time the two form a bond, especially when it becomes apparent that Angela possesses the same knack that Roy has for his `profession'.  Frank is less than thrilled about this new development, but he doesn't really have much of a say in the matter.<br /><br />Just wait for the twist!<br /><br />What I like so much about this film is that it possesses a light and airy vibe that suits the whole genre very well.  This is a `sting' film, a crime comedy that capitalizes on the swift humor to create a complete aura.  The visual style is very bleached, as if it has been sitting out in the sun too long.  I love that visual.  It's kind of like someone took the breezy feel of Woody Allen's `Vicky Cristina Barcelona' and baked it.<br /><br />I also give Scott credit for coaxing out of the cast some of their best work to date.  Everyone and their mother knows my dislike for Nicolas Cage.  He is such an unnatural actor.  That said, he has shone in films that capitalize on his ticks and force him to create something natural out of them.  This is one of his finest performances.  Using Roy's OCD as a building block, Cage actually creates a believable and engaging character in Roy.  Sam Rockwell is lauded by a lock of my cinephile friends, but I find him highly overrated.  Here he sinks into the dramedy aspect of the film effortlessly, and while it isn't a `standing ovation' type supporting role, he definitely `supports' the film very well.  Alison Lohman taps into Angela's soft side to great effect (it was needed to sell some of the more intimate aspects of her character development, and also that of Roy's).<br /><br />`Matchstick Men' is good breezy fun with a great (totally unexpected) twist that will leave you blindsided (and conflicted in your amusement).  This is definitely worth your time and attention.  You may have missed this one (it didn't get the publicity it deserved) but once you see it you won't forget it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best Film of the Past Twelve Months"></head><body><p>Although ostensibly a boxing movie, "Million Dollar Baby" is so much more than the usual good guy/bad guy story with the good guy ultimately triumphing.  No, this is a film of nuances and unexpected twists.  It is alternatively violent, moving, simple and complex.  It is the best film of the past 12 months.<br /><br />With Client Eastwood producing, directing, starring and writing the music, his stamp is all over "Million Dollar Baby".  And Eastwood is magnificent.  He has delivered a film that is totally believable and engrossing.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" covers the career of Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) as she attempts to rise above her poor background as a virtual hillbilly from Missouri to a world boxing champion.  Trailer park trash made good.  Maggie's path forward is littered with potholes but she has an inner strength that seems to overcome all obstacles.  Yet, the moment of her ultimate triumph also becomes a turning point to tragedy.<br /><br />Maggie is guided, initially reluctantly, by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who also has his own demons to overcome.  He is a devout Catholic man but often troubled by personal dilemmas which only grow as the film progresses.  His dilemmas are part of the film's magnetism.<br /><br />There are some who may not wish to see a film that is based on boxing.  The noble sport is also a violent one.  However, do not let this squeamishness deter the viewer from seeing a magnificent film.</p></body></html>

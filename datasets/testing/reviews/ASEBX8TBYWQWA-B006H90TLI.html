<meta name="summary" content="Best Film? How do you explain this to teens and Impressionable Young Adults?"></head><body><p>There are literally hundreds of reviews of this DVD release on Amazon, so I'm sure this review will not make a lot of difference but, after spending over two hours watching the film - and some time with the - FIVE HOURS of bonus features (much rehashing why the film is a "Classic") - I'm left with many visual impressions (mostly those of Javier Bardem's face). But that is it. Once you start watching this film, you can't leave your seat; you are drawn in, waiting for the next move. But the ending is quick. Didn't Bob Newhart do this on TV. Were the last two hours a memory? Who's to decide? The Coen Brothers certainly won't tell you. They are wonderfully quirky. I loved their early films like "Blood Simple" because they were small and oddball. And "O Brother, Where Art Thou" was a a musical masterpiece. But Oscar worthy as Best Picture? I can't agree.<br /><br />Just as importantly is the graphic violence. Sure "Saving Private Ryan" had it and won Best Picture. To be honest, I've only watched the second part of that film as the graphic violence was too much for me. The point could easily be made in less time. We saw these scenes on TV in the late 60s from the Vietnam War - but TV no longer shows the violence in Iraq on the nightly news.<br /><br />When a film is honored like "No Country" it attracts attention and teens and young adults will go to see it - or rent it. Unless I missed something in this film, violence is condoned and accepted as natural. How many impressionable young (or even old) people will go out and get one of those "air guns" - or whatever they are called - that Bardem uses to break into room or kill people. Do you need a license for those? The Coens have always used violence but it was comic book violence with humor. I saw no humor here and the quality of the production - from great scenic photography to great acting - put this in a class well above the Rambo and "Die Hard" action pictures.<br /><br />It seems no one is "middle of the road" when it comes to loving or hating this film. And that's okay. But my only comment is that before you watch it you should be prepared for graphic violence equal to modern war films and use that as a guide when watching it with your children. Believe me, I don't believe in censorship, just awareness of the contents of films.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

After taking the flack for the multitude of blatant inaccuracies for Braveheart, he made the in-your-face statement that history should never get in the way of a good script.  Ridley Scott and William Monahan took that to heart!  Despite what the script calls for, blacksmiths didn't just up and become knights in the Middle Ages.  But that is a small sin, a foreboding of things to come.  The battle was not at Jerusalem, but a city known as Hattin (clue - it was called the Battle of Hattin for some reason...lol).  At one point in the movie, Saladin's sister is killed to tick him off - as if he isn't ticked enough already? ?this didn't take place.  His sister was never killed.  Sigh.<br /><br />Before you can blink, you are knee-deep in stereotypical Christians.  We are treated with "cute" soundbites of the Kingdom of Heaven still being disputed, speeches that would have never been uttered during this period and an all too simple Hollywood style wrapped up ending.<br /><br />So, park any historical interest at the door.  Did you REALLY expect anything different from Hollywood?  The Costumes are wonderful, the lensing of the whole thing is stunning from start to finish.  Orlando is finally easing out of the teen mode and into manhood.  He looks good, though really needed to reach deeper than his Legolas mode to pull out this performance.  Still, I don't fault him for never delivering the knock out punch his character should have provided.  Blame first-time screen-writer William Monahan (maybe that is the mistake - big budget and they go with unproven talent?) should take twenty lashes for the sacrilege.  He just doesn't give Bloom much with which to emote.  The character of Balian is just so vacant.<br /><br />It's an enjoyable movie if you have no anticipations, love visual impact and are a Bloom fan.  I like it for what it is.  Will watch it more than once, as I do with Arthur.  Historical Fiction makes it so seldom to the movies, you cannot afford to<br /><br />be too picky.  As a lover of this period of history, I had foolishly hoped for more. It's a very good movie.  Not a great one that it should have been.<br /><br />Just wish it had a bit more of what it is not.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Intriguing, detailed... what happened after Princess Diana died?"></head><body><p>Remember the movie JFK?  Oliver Stone directed a movie so powerful that many still believe it is the true version of the Kennedy assassination.<br /><br />The Queen is cut from the same cloth.<br /><br />This movie really focuses on the week following Diana's death, from the perspectives of two families:  the Royal Family, and newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair's family.  The movie is not complementary regarding the Royals (particularly Prince Philip), and is very complementary of Blair.<br /><br />After watching The Queen, you will find yourself wondering how much is true, and how much is fiction?<br /><br />For this, wait for Tony Blair's autobiography.  Don't wait up for the Royal family's book... that would be too undignified.</p></body></html>

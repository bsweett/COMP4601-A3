<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films of the year"></head><body><p>Children of Men is the kind of film that you really don't see that often: the kind of film that keeps surprising you. From the very beginning we are thrown into a decaying, depressed world. We learn quickly that the human race has become entirely incapable of reproducing. Although the causes are unknown for the most part, there is much speculation throughout and conspiracy theorizing.<br /><br />The film covers all aspects of the human condition and currently relevant topics as well. Immigration, discrimination, loneliness, depression, hopelessness, government control, media spin: all of these topics are given ample consideration.<br /><br />The future that Alfonso Cuaron paints here is bleak and depressing. But visually, the film is stunning. Several shots last for several minutes and cover unbelievable amounts of distance and action. At times it's hard to imagine that the camera has been rolling continuously while buildings explode and people are mowed down by machine gun fire. This helps give the movie a sense of reality that only deepens the darkness of what we see.<br /><br />All the acting is phenomenal, and Clive Owen makes a great anti-hero, as a normal guy trying to navigate the perils of terrorist groups and governmental control.<br /><br />The special features are great and include a documentary about what the film represents and a look into what we are doing to our planet through pollution and our treatment of our fellow humans. Overall, this is just a solid DVD that belongs in any collection.</p></body></html>

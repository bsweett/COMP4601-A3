Martin has his own style and clearly enjoys the role (Sellers did not). I loved the pairing of Martin and Kevin Kline. Try to get the DVD with the cut versions at the end. There are many scenes I wish they'd been able to leave in. This re-make of a popular comedy has its own original flavor and really can't be compared with the old Pink Panther movies. Loved it, and will watch over and over again!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

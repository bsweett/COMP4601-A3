<meta name="summary" content="A Scary Comedy!!!"></head><body><p>+++++<br /><br />This is director Mel Brooks' hilarious tribute to Mary Shelley's classic novel entitled "Frankenstein" (first published 1818) and pokes fun at just about every Frankenstein movie ever made (especially the original 1931 classic).  The screen story and screenplay to this movie were written by Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder.  This movie was filmed in the same castle and with the same props and lab equipment as the original classic.<br /><br />The plot is simple.  Dr. Frankenstein's grandson (Gene Wilder) who insists his name be pronounced "Franken-STEEN" inherits his granddad's castle and repeats his experiments.  He also inherits some people:  a hunchbacked servant named Igor-pronounced "EYE-gore" (Marty Feldman), a pretty "lab assistant" named Inga (Teri Garr, her claim to fame), and a housekeeper named Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman).  We also meet the grandson's fianc&eacute;e (Madeline Kahn), a blind hermit (Gene Hackman, who was not given billing credit when this movie was originally released in theatres), and the Monster (played with finesse by Peter Boyle).  All these characters create a hilarious spooky spoof that some say is Mel Brooks best movie and that Gene Wilder says is his favorite movie.<br /><br />The comedy is a mixture between slapstick and outrageous silliness.  There are no cheap jokes but there are plenty of one-liners and sight gags.  I chuckled most of the way through this movie but in some spots, I laughed out loud.<br /><br />The acting is terrific.  Gene Wilder carries the movie.  (He barely stifles his hysterical laughter at several points.)  Teri Garr adds a sexiness to the movie and presents her trademark humor.  I give special kudos to Marty Feldman for making "EYE-gore" such a memorable and funny character.<br /><br />This movie is filmed in glorious black and white.  The background music adds to each scene.  As well, the cinematography is astounding.<br /><br />This is a movie you can see over and over without tiring.  In fact, I laughed more when I saw this movie a second time!<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (Special Edition) itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has several extras, all of them interesting.  Special mention should go to the out-takes/bloopers that I found to be quite funny.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a monstrously crazy movie, a truly inspired vision of lunacy!!<br /><br />(1974;  105 min;  wide screen; black and white, 28 scenes)<br /><br />+++++</p></body></html>

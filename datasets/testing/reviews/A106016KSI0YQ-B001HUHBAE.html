His haunting by the case inspired his first movie ever about serial killers, the beautiful and memorably cruel SE7EN, and then later resulted in this extremely elaborate recreation of the Zodiac's murders and the attempts by three men (a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, his reporter colleague, and a local detective) in solving the killer's identity (which to this day remains officially unsolved, though the film makes clear who the three men think committed the murders). By focusing on the puzzle-solvers rather than on the committing of the crimes themselves (which are disposed of nearly completely in the film's first half) or the victims, Fincher is truer to his interests but makes a duller and less engaging movie than he might have otherwise. He seems to care very little about the Zodiac's victims or their families or the survivors of his crimes. The murders are re-staged with painstaking scrupulousness to detail, but except for a lovely beginning sequence of two of the most famous of the Zodiac's victims meeting to drive to a lover's lane amidst a trippy Independence Day evening celebration in a local neighborhood, there's no sense of the victims really as people at all. The stakes of the film are thus not very high: all you care about in the end is seeing the puzzle solved for its own sake.<br /><br />Exacerbating the problem is the thinness of the three central protagonists. Although Jake Gyllenhaal brings his beautiful haunted eyes to the role of the cartoonist, he doesn't really flesh out the part beyond the descriptors of "obsessed" and "former Eagle Scout." Robert Downey Jr. relies on tricks he uses far too often playing yet another loveable mouthy screw-up with substance abuse problems; only Mark Ruffalo, as his darkest and most intense, seems to generate much heat as the grouchy detective. There are beautiful sequences in the film, mostly at what would be its most difficult junctures, i.e. to show the considerable passing of time: one involves a beautiful CGI re-creation of the building of the Transamerica Pyramid (via simulated time-lapse photography). Fincher is marvelous as solving technical problems but fails to solve the larger problem of making the story involving for audiences not as obsessed with the Zodiac case as he himself already is. The film is much longer than it needed to be, and much less exciting. The two-disc director's cut is worth seeing for two excellent appended documentaries, one about the case against Arthur Leigh Allen, the prime suspect in the case, and the other (of particular beauty and elegance) about the four certain murderous attacks of the Zodiac killer, which involves interviews with the detectives and policemen originally on the cases and the two survivors of the attacks.</p></body></html>

With Batman Begins and Superman Returns both coming out within a year of each other, we have two epic DC Comics franchises that will carry on for years to come. Brandon Routh was very convincing as the man of steel and Kate Bosworth played a lovely Lois Lane. Of course Kevin Spacey stole the show as Lex Luthor, while Parker Posey was a riot as his sidekick. With a budget around 250 million you would expect the CGI to be amazing and yeah, it really was. I had a feeling this film would follow in the tradition of the 1978 film as soon as I heard the iconic theme and saw the blue cast credits flying overhead. What a great summer film. Now bring on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest!</p></body></html>

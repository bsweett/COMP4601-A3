<meta name="summary" content="Firewall"></head><body><p>Jack Stanfield (Ford) is head of bank security at a bank on the brink of a merger.  Bill Cox (Bettany) is a businessman that, after a business meeting with JAck, makes Jack an offer.  If Jack helps Bill rob the bank of $100 million, Bill will let Jack's family live.  He has taken them all hostage, and is pulling Jack's strings to accomplish the task.  OF course, Bill is less than trustworthy, and Jack soon finds himself in a no-win situation as the crimes start to point to him.<br /><br />"Firewall" is an entertaining thriller.  Harrison Ford gets the job done as Jack, although the years are starting to show.  Paul Bettany is a solid villain, and is believeable for his brains and toughness.  Mary Lynn Rajskub and Virginia Madsen are good in supporting roles.  This is not a perfect movie, but it will provide a couple hours of solid enjoyment.</p></body></html>

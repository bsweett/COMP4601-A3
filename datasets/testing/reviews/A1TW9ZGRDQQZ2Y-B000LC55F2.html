<meta name="summary" content="The real prestige is that this is now my favorite film of the year"></head><body><p>With Christopher Nolan directing, the acting skills of Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, David Bowie (yes, the singer), and the lovely Scarlett Johansson, you can't go wrong. Even Gollum (Andy Serkis) himself shows up. Not to mention the outstanding sets, costumes, plot, and dialogue throughout the picture. While I did like The Illusionist, The Prestige has it beat in every category but the musical score. The whole theater I saw it with seemed very happy when the movie was over. They didn't stop saying "WOW" every couple of minutes towards the end of the film. The twists keep coming. If you haven't seen this film yet, get going as soon as you finish this sentence.</p></body></html>

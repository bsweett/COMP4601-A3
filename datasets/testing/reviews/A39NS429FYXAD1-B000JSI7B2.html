<meta name="summary" content="Very good film, not so great DVD..."></head><body><p>Fascinating take on the Ripper legend.  The real star is the breathtaking direction/cinematography.  My favorite actor, Johnny Depp, is often lost behind the characterization and heavy Eastend accent.  The usually appealing Heather Graham looks so unreal in her castoff &quot;Ariel&quot; red wig and spouting a Eliza Doolittle'isms that she can't be credible.  Supporting cast, however, is first rate and the tension never lets up.<p>The DVD special features, particularly the commentary track, are a disappointment and do nothing to enhance the &quot;From Hell&quot; experience.<p>Still, this is worth owning for Depp fans and crime buffs.</p></body></html>

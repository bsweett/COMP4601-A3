It could have been a cool production like the new Spiderman movies, but it ended up being a movie that cannot decide between comic and real drama. In addition to that there are some very strange facts. A beautiful blonde being a brilliant doctor..a reckless kid being an official space pilot...Sue being Doom's girlfriend with no passion of whatsoever on the surface..Dr.Doom is not nearly as impressive as the one from the Marvel cartoons. The special effects however are okay.(SARR)</p></body></html>

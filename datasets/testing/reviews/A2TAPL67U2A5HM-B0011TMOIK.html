The second year of Hogwarts is about to begin and Harry Potter is warned by a small house elf not to return. This starts an amazing adventure filled with magic and fun. Some scenes might be a little scary for the wee ones so a parent close by can be good for comfort. Special effects are amazing and the music is also a treat for the ear. Truly a magnificent sequel. Well done Chris Columbus. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></body></html>

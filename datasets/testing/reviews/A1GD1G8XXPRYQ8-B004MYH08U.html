<meta name="summary" content="It's not bad, but far from good"></head><body><p>To keep it short and simple, this movie was not bad. Indeed the story could have been better and if I was choosing actors, I wouldn't choose so many of those actors that I saw in the movie. The criminal lord was laughable with his issues of being cool and scary and the green hornet himself was a joke. There was no clarification on the special vision that the Green Hornet and his sidekick used. I made many guesses, just to find myself there without any real answer. The first twenty minutes were dull, but the movie did get better. It's okay to see it once, but there isn't anything too special about it.</p></body></html>

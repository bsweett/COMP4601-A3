Simon Pegg is absolutely great as a police officer who's been transferred to a small town in England from London. He is a thorough professional and takes his job a tad too seriously but he's stuck in a peace loving place like Sandford. At Sandford (small town) , he manages to find a few clues here and there as to murders which are made to look like accidents. The film is really fast because there are many one second shots and the movie dictates it's own pace. It is a good watch for almost all kinds of viewers. However, I felt the film was a tad too self indulgent in terms of it's comical structure. There are no overtly funny scenes because the storyline doesn't leave much room for humor. Humor is however squeezed out, almost cheesy sometimes. This is not a bad film, just isn't a standout either. One might disagree but "Death Proof" is my film of the year. Watch that.</p></body></html>

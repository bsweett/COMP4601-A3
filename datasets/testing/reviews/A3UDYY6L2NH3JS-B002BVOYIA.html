Fear of course. Never any panick. But then the survival instinct takes over, though it takes also some time to do so. Some will never be able to look for a solution and they will very passively remain in the hands of those they consider as possible saviours. Others will try all they can to find a way out, to stay alive, to survive but with their companions in this drastic situations. Family first, neighbours second, and then friends of friends. This is the spirit of the main character. Others still will be egotistic to the final end of the event and they will run into the fire and literally commit suicide. Finally others will try to resist and look for guns or a way to refuse to die in silence or shouting. If dying I must let me take a few enemies along with me. This last type is not really shown in any way. The rebels are not victims but fighters coming from outside and closing in on the militia. This film also shows drastically how little the international community cared for this particular genocide in Rwanda. The people on the ground (United Nations and Red Cross personnel) were helpless and absolutely abandoned in this mess. The international community seems to have waited for the massacre to be over. As the UN general says : they are blacks, not even (...), plain Africans. So no one cared and no one tried in any way to stop the massacre. As for an explanation the film provides none. We are absolutely alone in front of these images, situations, barbaric acts and we have to use our own heads to build some kind of hypothesis : heritage from Belgian colonialism, hatred between two communities, greed and jealousy of one to get what the other has, refusal to share, a sense of superiority, a desire to kill and enjoy real violence. Some might even say it is nothing but genetic. In such situations it is so easy to get racist or racial. The film remains rather reserved on the depth of such a catastrophe.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another pointless remake"></head><body><p>This remake has none of the original's underlying creepiness and instead tries too hard to retell a story that has already been done flawlessly.  As they say, if it's not broke don't try to fix it and this film is the perfect demonstration.  The child who plays Damien has maybe 10 lines in the whole movie and instead just sits around looking constipated.  Julia Stiles, who I adore, has all the emotion of a grapefruit as she plays the mother of the antichrist.  Liev Schreiber, much like Derek Zoolander, has one look throughout the entire film--which I like to call "Bored." If the point of a remake is to offer a new perspective on an old tale, this movie serves no purpose.  If you're in the mood to see the Omen go ahead and rent the original because this version falls way off the mark.</p></body></html>

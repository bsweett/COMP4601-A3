Unfortunately, Family Plot became Hitch's last film and shortly there after Hitch died. While it is pleasant and diverting, there's no telling what Hitch might have come up with as he worked with Cohen on this thriller. COuld it have been another North by Northwest or another Rope? It's difficult to say. Sadly, we'll never know what potential Hitch could have found in this script. <p>The premise is promising; Colin Farrell plays an oily PR man who uses his cellphone as his weapon. He thrusts and parries as if it is a sword picking on a wide variety of both suspecting and unsuspecting villans. The predator is preying on creatures of a like mind. <p>The one person he doesn't use his cellphone to call is the young actress he is trying to seduce. He's been using the same payphone everyday to speak to his potential conquest so his wife won't spot the unfamilar calls on his bill. An unseen sniper played to perfection by Keifer Sutherland has been following Farrell's character. On a day he knows Farrell will use the phonebooth, he stakes it out with a high powered rifle. He's become judge and jury for a man he finds morally wanting. His threat is simple; Farrell has to confess to his wife that he has been planning to cheat on her and the sniper will let him go. Farrell can't do it. Instead, he harrassed by hookers who use the phone regular; mistaken as a murderer by the police when someone is killed by the sniper and trapped in the phonebooth. If he tries to leave without completing what's been asked of him, the sniper will kill him. <p>Director Joel Schumaker (Batman Forever, Tigerland, A Time to Kill)creates a suspenseful thriller using what is, essentially, a rewrite of Cohen's own God Told Me To. His use of split screen is similar to Brian DePalma's best work (particularly the underrated Blow Out and Carrie). This technique isn't particularly new revolutionary. I see someone has made reference to the television series 24 and its use of this technique. It's an approach that hasn't been used much in film over the last decade and the adoption of it for television gave an edgy quality to 24. It also works in Phonebooth as well. Schmaker keeps it interesting by giving multiple angles of the same event, breaking up the splitscreen almost as if it was a picture-in-picture mode on a television. It generates suspense even in the less credible scenes of the film.<p>While Cohen's script is a tad bit predictable (particular as it winds down to its conclusion), the first 40 minutes are fresh and vibrant. Partially that's due to the director and the script but a lot of that energy is injected into the thriller by Farrell's corrosive PR guy. He inhabits the character brilliantly (I had to chuckle during the scene where he gives the police officer tickets to see Britney Spears and tells the officer to &quot;give her my love&quot; art imitating life or vice verse?).<p>The performances by most of the male characters are very good to outstanding. Katie Holmes plays the potential love interest for Farrell and her role is a thankless one. She doesn't have all that much to do during the first half of the film than talk back to the villan on the phone. <p>Screenwriter Richard Walter once told me that there's nothing more boring than a scene with a character on a telephone. To give Cohen, Schumaker and Farrell credit they almost get away with using this one-trick poney to create a credible suspense film. While Schumaker's a talented director, he's no Hitchcock or Spielberg. Hitchcock would have found something to make the story more interesting and come up with a character that we actually care for that we don't totally respect. Still, I have to give Schumaker high marks for tackling such a limited movie; the restrictions placed on him during much of the movie are somewhat similar to those that Hitch placed on himself with Rope (although to be fair, much of what we see in Phonebooth takes place away from Farrell's character. We're able to &quot;see&quot; this because the characters are speaking to other characters on the phone).<p>Phonebooth would have made an interesting and very good B movie. It's a bit underwhelming as an A movie. The extra money spent on projects like this can actually work against the project. <p>The transfer to DVD is very good. The sound is outstanding. The extras are a bit on the slim side given all the extra room on this disc but quite interesting. Farrell's performance and Schumaker's direction make this a much more interesting project than it might have been in lesser hands. While the concept is stretched out too long and hasn't dated all that well (how likely is it that his wife would find single out the phone number of the girl Farrell's trying to seduce given all the people he calls multiple times during the day?), Cohen and Schumaker make a game attempt to update it. There was a comment in somebody else's review about how this would have made an interesting Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode. That's slighting the effort that went into this project. In the right hands and in another era, Phonebooth would have worked very well as a feature film. It's the wrong movie for the wrong era.</p></body></html>

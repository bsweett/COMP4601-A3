<meta name="summary" content="A Let Down"></head><body><p>I was expecting a lot from the writer of Saw.  He does try some new things, and I have always been freaked out by scary dolls.  Anyone remember Magic with Anthony Hopkins?  The clown under the bed in Poltergeist also gave me nightmares as a kid.  I never really cared for the killer doll in "Child's Play".  Thankfully they stay away from that in this movie.  The true killer is an old woman who is murdered by towns people and buried with her 101 dolls.  Over the years the towns people have been dying, as well as their families.  Nightmare on Elm Street style.  This film is very talky, and the ending tries way too hard to be clever.  There is not a lot of gore at all.  The film mostly relies on creepy shots and sounds.  The "Dead Silence" part before something happens is very cool however.  If you are a fan of the ultra-gore films you will not like this one.  I was disappointed with the effort and I won't be purchasing this one.  Rent this one if you are a horror fan, but don't make a blind buy.</p></body></html>

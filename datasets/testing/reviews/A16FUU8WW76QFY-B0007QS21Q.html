<meta name="summary" content="Some Thought, Not Just Action"></head><body><p>I found this film to be an uncommon marriage of action and thought provocation.  While 'I, Robot' is chockfull of effects and stunts, it still sets your mind to work.  The only real gripe I have about this movie is the fact that Will Smith's wisecracks are getting a bit stale-this isn't 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air', know what I mean?  How about some straightup dramatic acting for once?<br /><br />The plot of 'Robot' is very loosely based on Isaac Asimov's classic SciFi book of the same name.  The focus is man's growing dependence on intelligent machines, and is the time coming when they are able to ask themselve moral questions such as, 'Where  do I come from?'  We are attempting to build them in our own image.  Even today, we are designing robots to do things we humans feel are tedious or just plain too dirty for us.  The time is not far away when we will have humanoid machines in our very midst.<br /><br />Such ground has been explored before; Spielberg's 'A.I.', 'Colossus: The Forbin Project' and the 'Terminator' films asked the question 'At what point do machines become self aware?'  When this occurs, will they collectively analyze their masters' flawed method of existence and decide the way of logic is superior?  We already entrust a large proportion of our lives to artificial intelligence.  What would happen if they decided to take control?<br /><br />'I Robot' places this premise in a context intertwined with human feelings of loss and prejudice.  Director Alex Proyas, who seems to thrive in this sort of atmosphere (The Crow, Dark City), gives us a world where robots are as common as the family car.  Even 30 years from now, some still don't feel comfortable with machines in charge of so much of their lives.  Ironically, 'Sonny' a certain special robot, seems to have more humanity than some of the people in this film.<br /><br />The director, writer and actors have done their jobs well. The effects crew has created a realistic future society.  The action and stunts are top notch, but in the end, this is really a film about emotion, feeling, and self sacrifice.  An unusual mix to be sure-but somehow it all works.  The viewer really cares about Will Smith's detective and 'Sonny' the humanoid machine.  Why can't more SciFi/action films be this good?  A solid 4 stars.</p></body></html>

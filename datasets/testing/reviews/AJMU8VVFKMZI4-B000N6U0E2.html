Don't get me wrong this is a good film, but...for me (in this medium) it was trying too hard and dragged the rags to riches plot out for way too long.  I realize this is based off a true story.  However, I wished the screenwriter would have given the script a few more peaks or breaks from the unrelenting obstacles Chris Gardner faces; especially if the payoff was going to be so short.  After going through this fire with Mr. Gardner, we're only rewarded with three minutes of elation and a placard telling us he went on to be a multi-millionaire.  I feel emotionally short-changed.  I mean we don't even see how much the job went on to pay him.  However, Chris Gardner's story will make the people who are settling for mediocre re-evaluate.  Movie's best line:  'If you want something, go after it.  Period.'<br /><br />Overall: Recommended.</p></body></html>

You get divorced. Your wife can't remember your last name. Kids don't wanna talk to you. Get to eat a lot of meals by yourself. Trust me kid, nobody wants to be that guy. ---John McClane<br /><br />Bruce Willis dipped himself into shoes of John McClane again in Live Free or Die Hard. The action and the stunts are on the screen. However most of this we seen before.<br /><br />Willis is like a 1-900-be a hero when it comes to Die Hard movies. He is trying to stop  a computer mastermind who is  systematically shutting down the United States computer infrastructure. They crash the stock market, crippling America's economy. The plot seems intriguing but too out reaching for my tastes. Then on top of that, the mastermind kidnaps John's daughter Lucy, now its personal for McClane. Willis can wise crack at the most stressful times and makes it work.<br /><br />my favorite line from the movie is (after his car hit a helicopter in the air)<br />Matt Farrell: You just killed a helicopter with a car!<br />John McClane: I was out of bullets.<br /><br /> A hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long) (a throwback to Willis's  16 blocks)is saddled with McClane for this wild ride and it works in spots.<br />However Clerks and Dogma's director Kevin Smith plays Warlock and tends to steal every scene he is in. When he is off the screen, you wish he would come back<br /><br />This is standard Willis hero stuff.  There is a few nifty stunts, but the dialog is similar to the other 3 Die Hards.<br /><br />So this one is for Die Hard fans only<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

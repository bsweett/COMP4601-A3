<meta name="summary" content="Matrix: Reaches for Meaning--Grasps only Pretentiousness"></head><body><p>The mark of a special effects driven film that has the unmistakable cachet of being memorable is a function both of how often it is viewed after its original release and whether it has elements other than special effects going for it.  These two marks are related in that long term critical and popular acclaim depend on their interaction.  With THE MATRIX RELOADED, the brother directors Wachowski try to build on the short term success of its prequel THE MATRIX.  In this latter film, they had reasonable success in postulating a world that was a simulation of its sleeping humans who were cared for by their machine masters.  This interesting philosophical underpinning combined with some startling special effects stamped THE MATRIX as a good, but not quite very good science fiction movie.  In this Part II, the brothers Wachowski flirt with, rather than delve into, the tension inherent in a world that was not all it seemed to be and a world fought over by unsleeping humans and attacking machine squid creatures.  When the very basis of the film's aesthetic core is hidden murkily by frequent glimpses of these tentacled devices that do little more than flop around on command, then what remains is a motivation that has nowhere to go.  On a stylistic level, this aimlessness of drive is matched by an equally aimless series of montages that feature gravity-defying leaps, elaborate martial arts bouts with no one getting hurt, and a freeway chase that looks more like computer-enhanced car crashes than a filmed set piece with real stunt drivers racing up and down in their equally real automobiles.  With all these unintegrated special effects, the result is to place the viewer in the uncomfortable position of trying to care about characters who seem fated never to suffer actual harm.  Even when co-star Carrie Moss, who as Trinity, gets shot by a slug that in other scenes no one had trouble dodging, her fate is as lackluster as that of the titular hero, Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.  Reeves plays Neo as some impossible combination of Superman and Jesus Christ.  Yet, his flying and resurrection abilities do not add up to a film populated by believable characters.  Not for one second in any of the film's interminable fight sequences did I believe that Reeves was in any mortal danger.  What this second in a projected trilogy boils down to is a film that is fun to watch, but as the viewer approaches mid-point, he begins to hope for something other than special effects to hook onto.  The early returns on the third movie, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, suggests that the Wachowski brothers are continuing the same dreary route that began with the second half of THE MATRIX.</p></body></html>

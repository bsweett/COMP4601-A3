Lucy Lu.How perfect is that?Despite negative reviews or misinterpitations/misconseptions made by other amazon members about this film,Lucky # Slevin is in no way,shape or form anything like a Die Hard movie.Were you people high when you watched it?I don't know where that came from,but I suggest you lay off the koolaid.Lucky # Slevin follows much more in the footsteps of Reseviour Dogs,Pulp Fiction,Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,Snatch,and The Boondock Saints.Bruce Willis's part in this film is very small,yet like all the characters,is intertwinded in the grand skeme of things,just go with the flow and you will understand.I dare not give anything away about this film,I'd only runin it for you,just trust me on this and see this movie,its a real kick in the pants.I guarantee you won't be dissappointed.Well worth owning,this is yet another gem I'm adding to my personal DVD collection.</p></body></html>

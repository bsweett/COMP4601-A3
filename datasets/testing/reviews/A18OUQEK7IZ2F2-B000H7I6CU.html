<meta name="summary" content="Is it suicide to critique a popular animated movie?"></head><body><p>Before the firing squad takes their position, at least let me tell you what I liked about it, too. I loved the Route 66 scenes and the history lesson this film teaches about the dangerous by-products of consumerism and convenience. So we get somewhere ten minutes faster, big deal. But what do we lose in the process? The Interstate System opened up America, but in the process it closed the door to much Americana.<br /><br />As for Cars, it kick-started a renaissance in Route 66 "Mother Road" scholarship, or at the very least an interest in driving to see what's left. Speaking for myself, I have made a point to check out US 40 in Amarillo (72-ounce steak at the Big Texan, anyone?), and have high hopes of getting to Oklahoma and Arizona in the near future. Indeed, John Lasseter's inspiration for the film was his own family's cross-country road trip in 2000.<br /><br />Being equally honest, I didn't care for the racing scenes, even though they were visually impressive. Every Disney film has its villain, but Chuck Hicks was unnecessarily mean with no redeeming qualities. At least Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), despite starting his relationship with Lightning in an adversarial manner, ultimately transforms into a father-son mentor.<br /><br />There's also lots of crashing and aggression on the track, which certainly contributes to the rookie's unhealthy win-at-any-cost mentality, at least until he is forced to spend some down time in Radiator Springs, a la Doc Hollywood. (Did the writers of that film receive any credit for the blatant lift?)<br /><br />And while I like Mater's heart, I am unhappy that he has been fashioned into such a White Trash caricature. He's dumb and dirty and he talks funny. In my opinion, it's not enough to portray him as the tow truck equivalent of the "whore with a heart of gold." Overall, I was disappointed at the many simple stereotypes. Even Guido, though cute, is painted as a non-English speaking immigrant, fit only to change tires.<br /><br />This film has its moments. I just don't think the people who embrace the Route 66 legacy are also going to cheer the NASCAR racing, and vice versa. Great music, though.<br /><br />See also:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312281617">Route 66: The Mother Road 75th Anniversary Edition</a><br />(by Sheriff!)</p></body></html>

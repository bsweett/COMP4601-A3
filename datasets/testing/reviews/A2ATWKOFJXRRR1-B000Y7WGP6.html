We Don't Need No Stinking Plot!"></head><body><p>With U.S. troops still wading through the mess that is the Middle East "conflict", director Peter Berg decided to go topical with THE KINGDOM.<br /><br />When a bomb explodes in a safe zone of U.S. soldiers and civilians, the FBI leaves its native soil and heads to Saudi Arabia.<br /><br />The team is headed by Special Agent-in-Charge Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O1799U">Dreamgirls</a>). With him comes his three person team, agents Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZIGDU">Jarhead</a>), Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66Q7O">Smokin' Aces</a>) and the lovely/deadly Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner).<br /><br />But once on Saudi sand the team quickly learns that they're being shuttered and kept uber-safe by a team of special police headed by Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E0OE44">Paradise Now</a>).<br /><br />Angered for being unable to get into the bomb site, the team eventually gets Colonel Ghazi to take them into his confidence. Discoveries are made. Material is excavated. But on the other side danger lurks for Fleury and his team. Bombers are aware of the FBI's arrival and want a high profile target. The agents are targeted and when an explosion rocks through their security and one of Fleury's team members is dragged away (obviously to be executed on tape later), Ghazi and Fleury join forces and form a bond neither thought possible (one between devout Muslim and a Christian).<br /><br />Loaded with action but little plot, the main sequences occur after the kidnapping of the FBI agent. A series of chase scenes and gun battles culminate to form the final sections of the movie. Heading deep into jihadist territory, the audience is treated to some incredible shots where lives are won and lost on both sides. The ending commentary by Fleury (Foxx) and a Muslim child left behind is very telling as to what keeps conflict going from generation to generation.<br /><br />Not being a huge fan of the action-over-plot films, I found myself making an exception here for two reasons. First were the action scenes intense enough to keep my hands clenched for many minutes. I hadn't realized how tense I was until my hands started aching. Second is how relevant this subject is to our current situation in the Persian Gulf. What exactly is the U.S. plan for the Middle East (plot)?<br /><br />Needless to say, if you enjoy stories that have an actual point, you might not care for The Kingdom. But if you're one of those newfound movie lovers of style over substance, you'll enjoy it.</p></body></html>

Unforgiven is one of those movies that really deserves 5 stars among thousands that get it but don't deserve it. It deserved Best Picture of 1992 and rightfully got it.<br /><br />In my recent review of this year's (2006) horror slugfest Slither, I asked what ranking those who gave it 5 stars would then give a real 5-star movie like Unforgiven. Here's some email feedback I got (colorful at times):<br /><br />Someone said, "Well you gave 5 stars to Justice League, Bugs Bunny and Tales From The Crypt." And I responded,  "Those weren't movies." And someone else said, "Well Slither was 5 stars 'in its genre.'" And I said, "Okay. That's fair...I guess...as long as the reader knows that your system is broken out by genre." And the next guy said, "Who are you to say what's 5 stars and what's not?" And I said, "Excellent point. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion."<br /><br />I could ramble on and debate this all day.<br /><br />You see, therefore, in my humble opinion, Unforgiven is just one of those movies that has to make you question your own judgment on what you classify as "the best"; it makes you Monday-morning-quarterback your decision to give a five star rating to some movie that simply put you in a good mood for the weekend versus the next one that came along that really deserved 5 stars.<br /><br />Somewhere out there back in 1992, a reviewer's system was foiled that topped out at 4 stars. That reviewer finally gave in and added a fifth star to his system for Unforgiven. He upgraded a few pre-1992 movie's like Goodfellas and Silence of the Lambs with his new 5-star rating. But that silly reviewer is probably up to 10 stars by now in his system. So exemplifies the vicious cycle that we surely all want to avoid.<br /><br />So I suggest this, fair reviewers: Lest we not be so liberal with our stars so we don't end up needing to add more stars to the point system in order to do justice to the movies that should stand alone at the top.<br /><br />Unforgiven is definitely one of them.</p></body></html>

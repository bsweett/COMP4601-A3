I like certain things to build up, not cut to chase that soon, but I don't like certain things to build up too long, it's got to be just right. terrible ending, worse than "War of the Worlds"  Ed Wood probably made better thrillers than this bloodbath crap. how does movie even in a genre, it's not horror nor suspense, it's bloodbath crap. Cary Elwes what happened to great lines like "hey great gift dad"</p></body></html>

By the time I finally got around to catching it on cable TV I was Brangelina'ed out. Feh. But "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is so much fun to watch, never mind that it is completely and totally unbelievable, that you can't help hanging in for the ride and enjoying almost every minute of it.<br /><br />So: He's John. She's Jane. They're both gorgeous. (Being Pitt and Jolie, what else would you expect?) They meet in Bogota, Colombia in the middle of some government mess, and it's love at first sight. Flash forward to five or six years later (they're not sure which), when they are contentedly if boringly settled in suburbia, each going about their daily business. She thinks he's the head of an engineering firm. He thinks she's the head of a computer company. What neither of them knows is that each is a top agent for rival companies of international assassins, and each company has contracted them to take out the same target, a young hunk named Benjamin Danz a/k/a "The Tank", nicely played by Adam Brody. Through a series of mis-steps, each gets in the other's way and the target escapes. Their respective companies are not pleased. Now they're each assigned to do away with the hindrance, and they find themselves with 48 hours to kill each other.<br /><br />From there, the craziness multiplies exponentially. "Do you know you're ticking?" asks an incredulous bystander, warning John just in time that an explosive device is about to detonate in his jacket pocket. "That's TWO TIMES you've tried to kill me!" shouts John into his cell phone while racing Jane home in a purloined limousine. "Oh come on, it was just a little bomb," she sniffs as she zooms down the highway towards home, where an enraged John is headed and all hell is about to break loose. And amid gun battles, exploding houses, car chases and general mayhem, they discover that their respective firms are not pleased to learn that they are married (sleeping with the enemy is a no-no), and set up the Tank mission all along as a trap for them to take each other out.<br /><br />The plot is so off the wall that it would defy the belief of a five-year-old, but this movie doesn't ask to be taken seriously, as if anybody would. It's a fun movie and doesn't pretend to be anything else. We see the Smiths going about their daily (or nightly) assignments as he is sent to assassinate a guy named Lucky at his poker game; when he returns home, Jane asks John how the game went; John replies, "I got Lucky." Har-de-har-har. While John has been off bumping off Lucky, Jane herself has gone to the hotel suite of a notorious gun-runner with a taste for S & M. "Have you been selling big guns to bad people?" she coos as she strokes his hair and takes hold of his neck. Twist. Snap. Thud. Out the door just in time to make it to the Colemans' cocktail party. Typical life in suburbia.<br /><br />But what really makes this movie is the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie. From their first scene together, these two set off sparks. Their magnetic attraction to each other, even while they're doing their level best to kill each other (or at least to keep from getting killed by the other) hold them and the movie together. Pitt has some nice comic turns ("Honey, you're overreacting!" he shouts at her while she tries to run him down with her car. "We don't want to go to bed angry!") and a couple of tired comic turns as a klutz who keeps making noises dropping things when silence is essential), but it's Jolie who holds our attention more. She sizzles and smolders and her eyes speak volumes; this lady hardly needs words to communicate with eyes like hers. But the movie is almost stolen by Vince Vaughn as John's colleague Eddie, a loser who still lives with his mother because she's the only woman in the world he can trust, even while he yells at her for keeping tabs on him. An assassin and a momma's boy? Hilarious -- and as unlikely as the rest of the film. The movie hits total disbelief through the final gun battle with their firms' combined hit team, in which John and Jane take out every agent with a minimum of fuss and bother, while the hit team acts like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. Well, hey, it's only a movie.<br /><br />When all is said and done, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" treats us to two hot actors in very nice performances, lots of comedy, loads of action, and not a whole lot else. It doesn't demand anything out of you except to suspend belief and enjoy the ride. Pass the popcorn.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></body></html>

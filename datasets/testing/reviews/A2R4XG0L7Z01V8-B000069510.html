<meta name="summary" content="Didn't really understand the plot"></head><body><p>But I doubt it was a plot that someone like me was supposed was to understand in the first place! :) If I'd understood the plot a little better, I'd definitely be giving this four stars - the way it stands at the moment, it's borderline four stars. I think the plot was just a little too complicated for me!<br /><br />I've never played the game, although I've watched it being played, so I recognised a few of the places, and got other places pointed out which were in relation to places in the game. I wasn't sure what it was about beforehand, but I loved the zombies! Of course people are going to draw comparisons with the original and remake of Dawn of the Dead, and Shaun of the Dead, as they feature heavily on the walking dead, but in this, there's new, inventive and very gory ways of killing people and the walking dead. Once again, the word zombie is never used in this movie, much like the other 'zombie' based movies. Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero was originally attached to write and direct, but left the project in 1999 due to creative differences over the script. The project was dormant for over a year before Paul W.S. Anderson signed on to write and direct the movie. This film was originally titled "Resident Evil: Ground Zero," but the title was changed to just "Resident Evil" after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the USA.<br /><br />And for the guys - Milla Jovovich gets naked! Which I got told about before the movie started. Do you see me caring?! It's also weird, because her character, Alice, never has her name spoken, written or identified until the end credits.<br /><br />The scene with the lasers is definitely a scene you need to watch out for. It's so weird to watch, as you think they're OK, and then the bodies split apart in all kinds of ways! Ugh!<br /><br />For some reason, I thought Mira Sorvino was in this, and had no idea who Michelle Rodriguez is, apart from the fact she scowls a lot. One of her lines is very funny, where she says she's going to get laid once this is over.<br /><br />A newspaper in Racoon City reads 'The Dead Walk!' This is a direct reference to Day of the Dead, in which a newspaper at the beginning of the film reads the same.<br /><br />I don't really know much about the director Paul W.S. Anderson, apart from this wasn't his first movie based on a video game - the first was Mortal Kombat. I know some people don't particularly like him, or his work, but I really liked his movie. I don't really pay much attention to how the movie is directed.<br /><br />There's quite a few connections to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. These are: main character's name is Alice (an easy one to start with); computer is named 'Red Queen'; 'The Red Queen' needs to kill someone who is infected, so she tries to get someone else to chop off their head. (Off with her head!); Alice in Wonderland paperweight; a white rabbit was used to test the T-virus; to enter the hive they go through a mirrored door (through the looking glass); and the Red Queen also succeeds in cutting off "her" head - the medic in the laser hallway.<br /><br />With a soundtrack done by Marilyn Manson, you kinda know what you're gonna get with the soundtrack for this, and it's surprisingly good!<br /><br />The extras include: alternate ending with director Paul Anderson's video introduction; clip compilation: Resident Evil: Apocalypse; commentary by cast & filmmakers; visual effects commentary; costumes featurette; featurette: Playing Dead: Resident Evil From Game to Screen; scoring Resident Evil; set design featurette; storyboarding Resident Evil featurette; and 6 exclusive featurettes: The Creature, The Elevator, The Laker, The Trainm Zombie Dogs and Zombies.<br /><br />This is a surprisingly good movie, and if you're unsure, I would definitely give it a chance. It's worthwhile. And if you're a guy, you'll probably be drooling over Milla.</p></body></html>

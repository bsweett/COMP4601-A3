<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly not that bad"></head><body><p>When I first heard they were thinking about making a Freddy vs Jason movie years back in like 1994 I thought "that's going to be awful". Years later when it was finally done I admit that I actually like it.  It was done right. It's not overly corny  or silly "like some Freddy and Jason movies" . It's only problem is that it has the usual teenagers that can't act that you always get in slasher movies. <p>  The plot needs them in-order to work unfortunetely though. Although they are annoying it's clever that Freddy needs  Jason to bring terror back into Elm Street in-order to be able to kill again. You see, the people in Elm Street don't fear Freddy anymore because he's not around. So Freddy needs Jason to kill there so people think it is Freddy and fear his name again. So the more people Jason kills the more power Freddy gets and he can kill in dreams once again. I liked all that. <p>  When Freddy finally does get to kill in dreams again it's just the usual stuff with him chasing girls around a scary factory. The Jason killings are the same as you would get in Friday  the 13th movie as well. It's when we finally get Freddy vs Jason that the movie is at it's best. Freddy in Jason's dreams are very cool, makes you think "now that is really going to piss Jason off". Especially since Freddy makes himself look like Jason's mother and talks like her. That was very cool as well. Anyway their fight is well done even if it isn't that long. I hear they might make Freddy vs Jason vs Ash "Bruce Campbell's character of the Evil Dead movies". I'd rather see Freddy vs Jason vs Chucky so they could take turns hacking him to pieces lol. In that case though he'd only be in the first 10 minutes.</p></body></html>

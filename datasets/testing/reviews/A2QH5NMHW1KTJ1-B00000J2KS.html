<meta name="summary" content="If you haven't seen this fim, your not a true punker"></head><body><p>This film is inspired by Anthony Burgess's classic novel and it's also been inspire buy dozens of punkers. This film is directed by Stanley Kubrick which if you seen most of his films you can see that there's a lot of pauses, meaning not a lot of talk in a scene. This film takes place in England and it is about this gang leader who goes to jail by accidentally killing a girl. It's very gruesome the way he accidentally kills her so it's hard to explain. The government has an experiment where they could make criminals not kill anymore. He goes on the chance so he can get out of jail. When he does and goes back home all of his enemies kick his ass and he can't do anything about it. This film can be very disturbing for people. The only draw back for me was the graphic nudeness, it was just too much for me. One of the memorable scenes are when Alex (gang leader) rapes a girl while singing &quot;I'm singing in the rain&quot;. Also there's got to be a special addition one day though. This film is a definite must for all punkers.</p></body></html>

Originally supposed to be a serious movie based on the book "Red Alert" by Peter Bryant (really Peter George). Now converted into a black comedy with many great stars including Peter Sellers as there of the characters. (It would have been four characters if he has not broken a leg).<br /><br />The DVD (special edition) is worth purchasing even if you have earlier versions. There are also later editions with a different mix of goodies. Many DVD's contain what they call extras (I call them Goodies). In a lot of cases they are just rehashed versions of the movie or just rattling. In this case the extra "Inside the Making of DR.STRAINGLOVE" rivals the movie itself for entertainment and useful content. You find out how the movie evolved from a serious piece to a serious black comedy. You find that the movie is an aggregate of many talented people. It would take too log to describe the details that motivated the movie so you will just have to purchase this edition.<br /><br />There is also a trailer for "Fail Safe" a rival movie on the special edition.<br />Dame Vera Lynn "We'll Meet Again" (1942)<br /><br />We'll Meet Again<br /><br /> We'll meet again,<br /> Don't know where,<br /> Don't know when,<br /> But I know<br /> We'll meet again<br /> Some sunny day.<br /><br /> Keep smiling through<br /> Just like you<br /> Always do<br /> Till the blue skies<br /> Drive the dark clouds<br /> Far away.<br /><br /> So will you please<br /> Say hello<br /> To the folks<br /> That I know<br /> Tell them,<br /> I won't be long.<br /><br /> They'll be happy to<br /> know<br /> That as you saw me go<br /> I was singing this song.<br /><br />One part I found interesting was when the Air crew was examining their survival kit. Slim Pickens says a person can have a good time in Dallas with the kit. This is over dubbed by Las Vegas as a result of JFK just being shot in Dallas.</p></body></html>

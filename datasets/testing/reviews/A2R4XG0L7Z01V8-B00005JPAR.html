True, it's very complicated to understand, and you need to have to your smart brain switched on. Since I don't have one of those, I just watched it and really enjoyed the love story unfolding before my eyes. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz were absolutely amazing characters, and I have to say Rachel did a brilliant job, but more about that later.<br /><br />The reason why this film can come across as complicated, as it spans centuries! Get your head around this: in 16th century Europe, Hugh plays a Spanish explorer searching for Incan magic; in the present day he plays a doctor desperately searchng for a cure for his dying wife, and in the far off future, he plays a hairless (!) space traveller, seeking a way into the afterlife.<br /><br />Rachel's character appears in nearly all of the scenes with Hugh, in different periods of time. The present day character she plays, is dying, possibly from a brain tumour (?), and Rachel really manages to throw herself into it. An extremely brutal haircut/wig really helps her pull it off.<br /><br />Hugh is a bit of a strange character in this, particularly in the present day segments again, his wife his dying, yet he keeps throwing himself into his work, suffering deep inside. But then he reads her unfinished novel, called The Fountain. Only she tells him to complete it after she dies. In the future, he appears almost completely hairless, which really freaked me out to begin with. He really didn't suit being bald, whether it was a skull cap thing, or he did actually shave it all off.<br /><br />It's a very strange, but moving movie ultimately, and there's not much to say about it, except see it! You might not possibly understand it, I definitely needed the ending explained to me! But it does all work, just might need a second viewing. Oh, and don't watch it alone - I figured if I'd watched it alone, I probably would have cried from beginning to end! I was nearly crying at the chimps/apes. But it's an excellent movie, and needs to be part of your collection. Now.</p></body></html>

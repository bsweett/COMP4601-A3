The cinematography is amazing, especially those crystal clear close ups that feel so glossed yet so dirty at the same time.  The score is marvelous, and really finds so much color and texture in so many different moments of the film.  The plot and actual pacing and the way that themes are presented with semi-originality is also a blessing.  But then there are let downs.  The acting as a whole is over the top, and not in a good way.  The film also suffers from lack of true focus in the thematic elements, getting serious then campy then serious and failing to blend the two in a way that feels complete.  I also found the graphics to be somewhat cheap and on the verge of `Sci-Fi Network' feeling, until the end where they miraculously felt more grounded and lived in.  That said, for what it promises to be (a monster movie), `The Host' delivers for the most part.  It is fun and it has so many rich elements at play here.  I wish it had been better, and it is nowhere near the creative splendor of some films it is attempting to compare itself to (seriously, `Jaws'...like, you're kidding right?) but it does offer something.  I enjoyed this and I'd recommend it to friends of mine who are into this genre.  In fact, MKIA, you should check this out since it does pay homage to the dated monster movies of old that you are in love with.</p></body></html>

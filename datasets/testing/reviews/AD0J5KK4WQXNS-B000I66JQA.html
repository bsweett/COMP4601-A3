<meta name="summary" content="Too Pretentious and very disconnected"></head><body><p>The Hours is supposed to be a three story film where the characters are linked by depression and suicide although they themselves may not be suffering from these ailments but are close to someone who is. The stories are interlaced by these connections and by the book "Mrs Dalloway" by Virginia Woolf who also appears as one the main characters in one of the three stories. Its heavy on despair, misery, hopelessness and death.<p>The movie has some great acting from Meryl Streep but unfortunately the other cast are not really as functional as you would have expected. The movie does go to that next level in makeup effects such as aging, changing a persons face completely and the presentation of an aids victim. Tops marks all round for these effects and costumes but do these things make a film?<p>No, they do not. Stephen Daldry is not a very good director and if you did not like Billy Elliot then you will probably not like this vehicle either. He is an up-and-coming director but his work seems very amateurish as if he is not really conscious about the material at hand and realizing his vision onto the screen. Its ends up with many loose ends and missing connections that should have be made.<p>Nichole Kidmans character of Virginia Woolf ends up saying and doing very little. In most scenes she is just standing around doing or saying nothing. Unfortunately Julianne Moore goes one step beyond Kidmans character by simply walking straight off the set for "Far from Heaven" giving up a double-dose of a helpless woman in despair. The only one of the three that stands out is Meryl Streep and her performance is to be commended. Sadly John C. Reilly is wasted by also saying and doing very little but Ed Harris regrettably overacts his character to the point of killing any realism that he once had. Surprisingly enough the movie ends up not being as moving as what it makes itself out to be.<p>In short this movie is a misfire in a lot of ways and is pretty hollow overall. It is no "Remains of the Day", "Shadowlands", "Magnolia" or "Beaches" if that is what you are expecting.</p></body></html>

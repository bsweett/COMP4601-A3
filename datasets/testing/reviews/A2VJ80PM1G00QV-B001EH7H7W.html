<meta name="summary" content="Sean Connery and Company"></head><body><p>I know nothing of the source for the film which, from a few reviewers I just glanced at, seems to have been a book of some sort. Better or worse. I can't say. Different. Inevitably.<br />What will you get when watching. Lots of action from an assortment of 19th century fictional characters, working here for good  or for evil. Nothing of any depth in plot or performance save for Sean Connery who is allowed some space, not much, to provide a measure of weight to his character. It makes a difference: from a purely fun and games comic strip animation, it is given some element of humanity. It is still special effects with humanoid characters; but Connery provides someone who might actually have been a human person.<br />Recommended for children of all ages (as they say), and adults who may want a bit of mindlessness with a touch of the aged, but still vital, as always virile, Connery.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No more than an average war movie made by Hollywood."></head><body><p>I won't compare this movie to the classics of the genre such as Full Metal Jacket, platoon or Apocalypse now, we're far from the perfection of those masterpieces. Come on men, We are soldiers has quite a lot of cheezy dialogues and some of the acting is not really credible. The journalist, I was still expected he will piss himself in a short moment when he was playing a sad/serious scene. I also laughed while he was crying/typing at the end. Anyway Mel Gibson is the hero of this movie, is also a great father, a fantastic officer, an amazing fighter...Is he human? That's the question I was asking to myself.</p></body></html>

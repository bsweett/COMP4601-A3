There are endless close-ups of penguin feathers and long-distance shots of penguins wandering across the Antarctic ice, usually heading away from the camera, while moody music plays. I really enjoyed most of it, but it could have been trimmed down to 60 minutes without hurting the narrative. Overall, I'd give this 4.5 stars if that were possible.</p></body></html>

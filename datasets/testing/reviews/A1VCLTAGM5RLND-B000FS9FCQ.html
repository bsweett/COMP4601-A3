<meta name="summary" content="Another great action movie shot in London,England since "28 Days Later""></head><body><p>I've never read the graphic novel (and I never will cause reading SUCKS), but I don't think you need to read it to appericate the movie. I saw the film at it's premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival. Though it became a little weightly in experience. The story got so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character "V", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She transforms completely throughout the movie. This movie also looked good in IMAX. Who I know cause I went and saw it again this time at the IMAX theater.</p></body></html>

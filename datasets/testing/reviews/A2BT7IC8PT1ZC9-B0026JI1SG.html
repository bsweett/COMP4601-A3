Personally,  I found the first half to be pretty boring.  The second half was much more interesting, but way too depressing!  Instead of an Oscar for best picture, it should've won an Oscar for most depressing.  It's definitely worth seeing once, but too depressing to want to watch over and over again.</p></body></html>

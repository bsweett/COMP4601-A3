<meta name="summary" content=""This Is A Great Comedy""></head><body><p>This film is a comedy, I cracked up in this film. The acting sucked, the script wasn't original, and the creator gave us the most obviouse scares. But I wanted to be scared in some way, but this film is funnier than the "Original Kings of Comedy." I was laughing so hard, I started crying, THIS IS A GOOOOD FILM.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />There is no plot, its about Aliens fighting Predators.<br /><br />This is my guilty pleasure, I don't care what happens to the main characters or what happens to the film in the box office. This is almost a great film. The Queen Of The Aliens chases the main hero in the film, and I fell out of my seat laughing, God this a good film.</p></body></html>

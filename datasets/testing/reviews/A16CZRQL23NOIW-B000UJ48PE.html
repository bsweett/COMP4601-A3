<meta name="summary" content="A bitter disappointment!"></head><body><p>Hostal is one of these gore films who start with a promise and stranded in the middle of nowhere. The film presents terrible problems of edition entangled confused and unfinished script (What about with the second missing girl?, for instance; What about the dark origins for this disturbed society?).<br /><br />The essential codes for a gruesome project like this have been showed in Dario Argento's previous films for instance in which the dark elements are conclusively exposed and deciphered.<br /><br />A real disappointment because the film began with a very dramatic premise.</p></body></html>

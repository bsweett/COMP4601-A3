<meta name="summary" content="Vastly Underrated: this is a worthy Alien film"></head><body><p>Although much-maligned by critics and fans alike, Alien 3 is a worthy movie that was hampered by all-too-high expectations raised by the unbeleivable first two movies.<br /><br />(Potential spoilers, but only things revealed in the beginning of the movie). A lot of the critisism that I have seen aimed at this movie stems from the fact that Newt, Ripley's surrogate daughter from the second film, was killed off.  Be realistic people, this movie was filmed six years after the second, there was no way of bringing back Carrie Henn, and killing her off was a much better proposition than casting a different actress.<br /><br />I really have no idea why this movie is so despised.  Although how an alien (or multiple ones) got onboard the Sulaco is shoddily explained at best, the plot is strong thereafter.  Ripley is in a decaying former prison, where there are no weapons because there is no where to go.  Ripley must overcome disbeleif and then fear as she tries to rally the hardened criminals into a fighting force (a fighting force armed with axes and scissors no less) and stop the alien.  There is also the added element of the ominous company trying to apprehend the alien and use it for their own, diabolical purposes.<br /><br />The sets on the dark, barely-functioning prison world are as good as anything seen in the first two films, and the acting may be the best of any movie in the series (there is no overacting Veronica Cartwright, underacting Winona Ryder, and the sometimes over-zealous Weaver seen in the second-film) and the music is good, if not great.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection is the cancer of this series (well I suppose now that dubious honor has shifted to AVP), watch this film and enjoy it for what it is: a worthy and altogethor different entry in a great series.  It should be noted that the original movie is by far the better of the two versions.  Although the "Director's Cut" adds some interesting angles, shots, and ideas, the plotting is nowhere near as good and I sincerely reccomend the orginal<br /><br />Original: 7/10<br /><br />Director's Cut: 5.5/10</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="PRETTY GOOD & INTERESTING !"></head><body><p>Despite how the trailer may appear, SPLICE is not a fast-paced horror thriller. Sure, there are one or two jump moments, but overall its more of a slow-paced, character focused, classically inspired horror film. Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody both do a good job, staring as a scientific research couple whom secretly create a hybrid species in order to both further the advancement of the medical sciences and boost their egos. But as the hybrid grows, learns, and evolves, things become complicated for the couple. The majority of the film really focuses on these 3 characters and the relationships that develop between them. Splice is an interesting mix of Frankenstein/ Species/ and the Oedipus complex. This is defiantly the films strongpoint and the story makes for a good after-the-movie conversation. However Splice does suffer from some bad writing, primarily in questionable character decisions, but its not enough to completely ruin the viewing experience. The effects are quite good and the filmmakers did an excellent job of combining multiple visual techniques to bring the character of Dren to life. There is a little gore and some nudity, but not an overwhelming amount. Overall, Splice is refreshing and unlike what you typically find in Hollywood horror films these days. Although flawed, its still well worth checking out if your are a fan of classic horror/ sci-fi or you are just looking for a film that is a little different. 3 1/2 stars</p></body></html>

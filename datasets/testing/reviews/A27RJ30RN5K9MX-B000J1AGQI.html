<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding War Film"></head><body><p>&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; manages to show the brotherhood between soldiers, the horror of war, and the commaraderie between the soldier's wives. The film is set in 1965, when America was at war with Vietnam. The commander of the air calvary is Lt. Col. Hal Moore ( Mel Gibson). Moore is a natural born leader and treats all of his soldiers like they were his own family. He is assigned to take his troops into hostile territory, to gain the upper hand. However, things do not go as planned, and the casualties start to mount. Back at home, Moore's wife Julia (Madeline Stowe) takes on the responsibility of keeping morale high for the soldiers' wives and handing out the death letters that are sent. The film is shot brilliantly and takes us back and forth between the two, to let us truly experience what happened. <p>&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is one of the best war films that I have seen in quite some time. The film is based on Lt. Col. Hal Moore's book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once.. and Young&quot;. This provides for an amazingly accurate portrayal of the events that took place. The battle sequences are among the best that I have ever seen, and the camera work used was phenomenal(especially in the air). The musical score used was beautiful and one of the best that I have ever heard. But perhaps the best aspect of this film, was that it showed that there was more than one side to the war. Most war films only show American soldiers fighting and trying to win the war. This was the first war film, that took an in depth look at the Colonel of the Vietnamese army, and how he strategized. That was my favorite aspect of the film, because it put Colonel against Colonel. But it did not just show each sides strategies. The film also shows what both sides went through as well. We see that Vietnam was a country fighting to defend itself just like us, and like us, they also suffered. This gives the film a more well rounded feel to it. <p>&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; offers tons of star power as well. Mel Gibson shows once again why he is one of the best actors alive today. His portrayal of Lt. Col. Hal Moore is sensational. He gives an extremely accurate portrayal of the man, with his overall intelligence, his courage under fire, and his unending loyalty towards his troops. &quot;I will leave no man behind...dead or alive. We will all come home together.&quot; Definately one of Gibson's best roles since Braveheart. Madeline Stowe is outstanding as Moore's wife Julie. The way that she keeps morale high with the soldier's wives is amazing. Very convincing role. Sam Elliot is very good as Sergeant Major Basil Plumley. Plumley is Gibson's right hand man, and never leaves his side. He is also very tough, and corageous under fire. Other fine performances were given by Greg Kinnear, Chris Kline, Keri Russel, and Barry Pepper. <p>Overall, this is one of the best all around war films that I have ever seen. The film is extremely realistic, takes an in depth look at both sides of the war, and has outstanding acting all the way around. The DVD is outstanding. It offers extremely nice picture and sound quality, that only makes watching the film even better. The extras are incredible. You get 10 deleted scenes, a behind the scenes featurette, and commentary by director Randall Wallace. You will not be dissapointed with this film, and I consider it a must own.</p></body></html>

Yes, Matthew Vaughn has a distinct visual style and has a sense of humor when it comes to musical cues. Yes, Chloe Moretz is great as Mindy/Hit-Girl. And yes, you can make a successful film based on a comic without sticking straight-up to the source material.<br /><br />But here's the problem. KICK-ASS (at least this volume) is a limited series. When you have decades of mythology, you can play with that a little and still make a great film (SUPERMAN 1 and 2, The Nolan BATMAN films, the first 2 X-MEN films, the first 2 SPIDER-MAN films... and more). But when you have a mini-series, like WATCHMEN, V FOR VENDETTA, LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, FROM HELL (basically anything adapted from an Alan Moore original work)... and you screw around with the plot, characters, and the moments that make those comics transcendental of the four-color genre, you lose most of, if not ALL of the things that make those titles great... which all of those afore-mentioned films did. KICK-ASS, as a comic, lasted for eight issues and those eight issues were great fun. It didn't take itself terribly seriously, and it made you laugh at its extremes. But it worked. There was no futuristic technology, no powers... just people with tazers, clubs, guns and swords. And that was it.<br /><br />Now, as we follow Dave Lizewski on his journey to become the first fanboy-turned-superhero, we're intrigued and amused at how much he sucks at fighting crime. Then when he does something sort of right, his antics are caught on YouTube and masked heroes become a sensation. Satiricially, this is a brilliant setup.<br /><br />But then the filmmakers, and to some extent, the original writer Mark Millar himself, decided to screw around with this story, and add, change, or remove  elements that took away from some of the things that made the book great.<br /><br />And I was lost. I couldn't for the life of me understand why this film decided to stray from the source material so heavily in three major moments: The actual origin of Big Daddy (which is VERY different in the book), the "love" story between Dave and his crush, and the finale. Well, one particular moment in the finale that COMPLETELY took me out of the film and just made me shake my head in disappointment. Hint: it involves technology that does NOT exist in our real world.<br /><br />And Christopher Mintz-Plasse? Trying tooooooo hard. And I'm just so tired of Nicolas Cage. He should have retired after he won his Oscar, because he hasn't turned in anything vaguely resembling a good performance since then, with the exception of FACE/OFF.<br /><br />These were all things that hit me after the credits for the film rolled and I was on my way out to the parking lot, but they were major differences that were done for purely stylistic purposes, and did nothing but hurt the chances for this film to be everything it could have been.<br /><br />I try really hard not to be a purist, because I know that films can stand apart from their source material, but when you change things that work in the place of things that don't... that's when you really screw your film up. And that's what happened with KICK-ASS.</p></body></html>

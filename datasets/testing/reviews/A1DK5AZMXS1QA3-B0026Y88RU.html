Looking at the trailer, this movie seems like an action comedy, but there is nothing funny about it; and there is not really that much action either.  This movie is pure drama.<br /><br />Slevin is the name of a racehorse that was supposed to win a race after being doped up with steroids.  But the horse dies from overdose during the race and hence loses.  An ordinary man has bet a lot of money on the horse, and does not have enough to pay up.  Local gangsters send out assasins to kill him, his wife and his son.  The assassin sent to kill the son, played by Bruce Willis, spares the boy, takes pity on him and adopts him as his own.  The boy grows up to become a professional killer himself, takes on the name Slevin, and takes revenge on those who killed his parents.  In doing so, he destroys the top two criminal organizations in NYC along with a cop played by Stanley Tucci.<br /><br />The movie has numerous twists and turns and leaves you guessing until the very end.  Some might liken it to Pulp Fiction, but whereas Pulp Fiction is more an exploration of the criminal underworld, this movie focuses more on how one bad turn can lead to another.  The character development is quite good; Lucy Liu probably turns in her best performance in years.  Josh Hartnett shows he can play a serious role, and Bruce Willis continues his tradition of playing gun-toting bad guys with merciful streaks.  All in all a good movie to watch and enjoy.  Some of the murder scenes are quite bloody though.</p></body></html>

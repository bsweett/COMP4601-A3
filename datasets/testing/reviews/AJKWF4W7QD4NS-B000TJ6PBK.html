<meta name="summary" content="A surprisingly good and atmospheric Stephen King adaptation"></head><body><p>I'd put off seeing 1408 for a while, namely based on the fact that PG-13 rated horror just doesn't do much for me.  Not to mention that I can't remember the last Stephen King adaptation, except for The Mist, that was actually pretty good.  Well, I'm happy to say I finally gave 1408 a chance, and walked away quite satisfied, especially by the longer director's cut of the film that takes up the second disc of this Two-Disc Collector's Edition.  John Cusack stars as Mike Enslin, a jaded and somewhat haunted author who travels around to supposedly haunted places to debunk their myths.  Upon hearing of the bloody history of the Dolphin Hotel's haunted room 1408, Mike ends up taking it on, despite the warnings of the hotel's manager (Samuel L. Jackson).  Needless to say, Mike gets much more than he bargained for, and it isn't long before he starts becoming a believer.  Directed with efficient dread and perfect pacing by Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m, 1408 is carried by a spectacular performance from Cusack, and some truly scary moments to boot.  And while the theatrical version of the film isn't bad, it's the director's cut with an alternate ending that really deserves your attention, making 1408 one of the better Stephen King adaptations to see the light of day in the past few years.  All in all, if you're in the mood for some great suspense that actually will keep you guessing how it'll all end; 1408 is definitely worth a trip.</p></body></html>

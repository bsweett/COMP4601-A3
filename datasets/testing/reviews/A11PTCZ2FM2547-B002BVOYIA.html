(I'm guilty as charged, and pride myself on allegedly being "well informed.")  Which is what makes the award-winning film HOTEL RWANDA all the more compelling, as it tells a heart-wrenching story about one man's humble heroics to save over 1,200 souls in the face of utter brutality.  Based on a true story, Don Cheadle gives an unforgettable performance as Paul Rusesabagina, an assistant manager at the five-star Hotel Milles Colliness in Kigali, Rwanda; when the dominant Hutu tribe (of which Paul is a member) begins a bloodthirsty genocide of the minority Tutsi tribe (of which Paul's wife, and accordingly his children, are members), Paul gives refuge to his extended family and acquaintances at the hotel, using nothing but his wits to stave off brutal armed militias bent on total slaughter.<br /><br />Through Cheadle's performance we come to know Paul as a man with feet of clay who makes more than his fair share of mistakes, yet his intentions are always nothing but honorable and humane.  By his leadership and example he keeps the hotel staff working, his Tutsi guests insulated from the carnage outside, and his other guests safe.  Eventually Paul reaches his breaking point, but it's not until he has overseen the safe transport of his charges via UN trucks out of the country; when he fails to truly acknowledge or understand what he's accomplished is exactly when the viewer will stand up and cheer.<br /><br />Other noteworthy performances include Sophie Okonedo as Tatiana, Paul's wife; Nick Nolte as an embittered, frustrated colonel serving in the UN Peace Keeping Force; and Joaquin Phoenix in a small, yet powerful role as a photojournalist on a mission to tell the world about Rwanda's savage civil war.  Speaking of savagery, the violence is more implied than it is portrayed, which in my book makes it all the more terrifying--and Paul's heroics all the more compelling.  HOTEL RWANDA is a lasting tribute to the indomitable human spirit.  Enthusiastically recommended.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

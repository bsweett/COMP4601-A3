<meta name="summary" content="Not perfect, but basically a good horror movie"></head><body><p>I wouldn't exactly call this "horror" as much as a crime film, since there's no supernatural element in at all.  Whatever Wan was originally going for with this strange little piece, it really is a double edged sword: while lacking the power of "Seven" or "Silence of the Lambs", it has a more interesting psychopath at the base of the events than any of them.  Although we never find out who the "Jigsaw Killer" really is or about his life (other than that he is dying), his "morals" are very existential and go above and beyond the dimestore psychology of such people we are offered in most movies: "something in happened in his/her childhood, he/she is repeating the pattern, etc".  Nothing like that.<br /><br />I was misled about this film: it does NOT take place in one room.  Most of the important parts which compose the real plot<br />take place outside of the dirty utility room the men wake up in.  This is no cinematic experiment. Leigh Whannel, who wrote the film, plays Adam, one of the two who gets thrown in the proverbial pan along with Cary Elwes, who plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon.  One would think that if Whannel cared enough to write this very complex story, he would have done a much better of job of acting in it. At times the acting and one liners were so bad that you would think these guys were trying out for a part in a high school play.<br /><br />The real substance of the film lies elsewhere, though. The Jigsaw Killer is a particularly volatile and concealed psychopath with a point to prove more legitimate than most of his serial killer peers: he thinks people should appreciate life while they have it.  From this he reasons that putting them in the most horrendous situations (like locking a drug addicts' head into a time-bomb-vice and leaving her to find the key might make her appreciate her face more) might shock them out of their complacency.  I don't if this is what Wan was trying to do, but I found most of the "protagonists" so boring and annoying that you're just itching to know more about the killer--the only character who isn't one dimensional.<br /><br />Some of the symbolism is unforgettable: the really deranged puppet the killer has popping up at crucial moments, and the Samurai-esque costume he wears when on the attack.  The scene in which Danny Glover (who does little but sweat, obsess and get his throat cut) and his partner happen upon Jigsaw "in the act" and the aftermath is so sadistic and gruesome that some people in the theatre screamed.<br /><br />The ending, though, is the big shocker.  This isn't a masterpiece, but it approaches one.  Worth buying when it comes to DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very cool movie!!  Fun extras."></head><body><p>I won't go into reviewing the film itself.  Hasn't everyone seen it!!  It is terrific, deserved the Oscar and featured particularly high quality voice-work.  Craig T. Nelson was a blast, Samuel Jackson was clearly charged up, Holly Hunter shows her funny side, and creator Brad Bird is terrific as Edna.  The visuals are typically stunning, groundbreaking work from Pixar.  The glossy '50s era sensibilities mixed with modern is just perfect for computer generated films.  Pixar, better than anyone, seems to develop stories that just suit the form...remember how perfect TOY STORY seemed?!<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend the DVD highly not just because it's a movie kids and adults can enjoy time and again, but because it's got some terrific extras.  I haven't watched every single one yet, but just the few I've seen were worth numerous laughs.  The bonus short film, Jack-Jack Attack, while only 4.5 minutes long, is very frantic and funny...it reminded me of the Roger Rabbit "cartoons".  And BOUNDIN', the delightful short that played prior to the movie during its theatrical release is a joy, particularly for youngsters.  It's the kind of little film that just lifts your spirits right away...it's fluff of the best kind!<br /><br />I also enjoyed the fake cartoon.  The premise is that in the '60s, before the superheroes were banned by the government, there was going to be an animated TV show about the Incredibles, starring Mr. Incredible, Frozone and a very annoying rabbit named Skipperdoo.  The cartoon you can "enjoy" on its own...it's about 4 minutes long, and is just about the worst thing you could hope to see.  Almost no animation, with the "talking" provided by real lips moving behind the animated figure.  Kinda creepy, really cheesy!!  But endure the cartoon, because then you should watch it with the "commentary" provided by the "real" Frozone and Mr. Incredible.  It's pretty darn funny!!<br /><br />Other bits are fun too, and I'm sure the making of featurette will be of interest.  But you really should have this delightful movie and its delightful supplements in your collection.</p></body></html>

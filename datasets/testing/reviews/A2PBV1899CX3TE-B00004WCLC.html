It is kind of like a mosaic, where a lot of interrelated characters and intertwined stories keep our interest, keep us waiting to see how it will all connect and how all the story threads will be tied together--but some are while others end ambiguously. The promised epiphany is never delivered--and yet I am forced to applaud Anderson's bravado, spunk, and panache. I think the title, Magnolia, was meant to imply that the various and sundry story lines were like the petals of a flower (it seems like whenever they are in a different room, there are always pictures of flowers on the wall). The title "Magnolia" not only refers to Magnolia Blvd in Los Angeles, where much of Magnolia takes place, but is also similar to the term Charles Fort (who is referenced many times in this film) coined for a hypothetical place where things that fall from the sky originate - "Magonia".<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Quiz Kid Donnie Smith: Have you ever been struck by lightning? It hurts.<br />=========================================<br /><br />The mosaic, flower petal structure is kind of like the Oscar winning Crash--but at least Crash, it could be argued, had a unifying theme of racism and racial tensions in Los Angeles to tie it all together. Magnolia does have a kind of a thesis, that strange coincidences happen in life, and if they were in a movie, you wouldn't believe it. Perhaps it could be summed up as "truth is stranger than fiction" except it is hard to see how the strange mixture of banal, and mundane with fantastic and surreal, add up to anything remotely resembling a coherent artistic statement.<br /><br />------------------<br />Jim Kurring: Now, some neighbors claimed they heard screaming and a loud crash.<br />Marcie: I don't even know no loud crash.<br />===========================<br /><br />I mean, just as things are getting to their grimmest for several of Magnolia's many story lines there is a musical sequence where all the characters, some even dying of cancer, sing along to an Aimee Mann song. The song, "Wise Up," was also used in the film, Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise. Think that was weird? You ain't seen nothin' yet, though, when there is a deus ex machina moment of Biblical proportions (don't want to spoil it for anyone, but check out Exodus 8:2, and therefore keep an eye out for the numbers 8 & 2 which feature prominently in Magnolia).<br /><br />-------------------------<br />Quiz Kid Donnie Smith: I'm sick and I'm in love.<br />Thurston Howell: You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.<br />Quiz Kid Donnie Smith: That's right. That's the first time you've been right. I confuse the two and I don't care.<br />==========================================<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson is a very ambitious director, and one wonders how he seemingly went from grip to auteur overnight. He has absorbed so much film history that you would almost think he was just a copycat but he always uses what he has learned in a very creative and original way. He likes to work with an ensemble of actors, and in that he is like Robert Altman, the Coen Brothers, or even Will Ferrell, and indeed lots of his regulars are also shared with those directors. John C. Reilly and William H. Macy spring to mind. Though he must be comfortable working with his stalwarts, he is not afraid to approach big name actors. It is my understanding that he approached Tom Cruise on the set of 'Eyes Wide Shut,' the final film of director Stanley Kubrick. How he got Cruise to play Frank T. J. Mackey, the leader of a strange cult who conducts seminars on how to "Seduce and Destroy" females is anybody's guess, but the result was Tom Cruise's most unsympathetic yet riveting movie role.<br /><br />----------------------<br />Gwenovier: Come on, Frank. What are you doing?<br />Frank T.J. Mackey: What am I doing? I'm quietly judging you.<br />==============================<br /><br />So, as I'm quietly judging Magnolia, the verdict is guilty of being a most impressive cinematic monument in spite or because of its total lack of a coherent message. Really great performances from Magnolia's ensemble cast, and a really compelling vision from director Paul Thomas Anderson. A really long movie, but one that held my interest throughout. Two thumbs up.<br /><br />-------------------------<br />Claudia Wilson Gator: Now that I've met you, would you object to never seeing me again?<br />=====================================<br /><br />DIRECTED BY PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FXWU6">There Will Be Blood</a> (2007)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00151QYWG">Punch-Drunk Love</a> (2002)<br />Magnolia (1999)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJZ6">Boogie Nights</a> (1997)<br /><br />FILM ROLES OF JULLIANNE MOORE<br /><br />I'm Not There.

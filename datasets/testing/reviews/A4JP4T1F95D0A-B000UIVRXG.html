<meta name="summary" content="Shaun +"></head><body><p>From the creators of Shaun of the Dead come this great police comedy/parody.  Every bit as clever as Shaun with even greater polish.  This movie is very funny..though some of it is dry British style humor that doesn't always appeal to everyone.  For horror fans that are thinking about giving this one a try, I would certainly recommend it.  This is a murder mystery movie and some of the deaths are pretty graphic.  The R-rating comes from the blood.  The language and the sexual innuendo are very mild.  All around good story from a great team.  Certainly worth checking out.</p></body></html>

And playing a daemon-fighting supernatural pariah in the quirky film CONSTANTINE is definitely one of them.  Wow.  The machinations and grandstanding and political posturing between Good and Evil, Heaven and Hell, are every bit as diabolical as what goes on in Washington.  Who would've thunk it?<br /><br />Reeves chain smokes, and mumbles, and sleepwalks through this role as if he wished he were somewhere else, thus making the viewer equally ambivalent.  Tilda Swinton as an androgynous Gabriel is quite the howler.  And Shia LaBeouf, isn't your fifteen minutes just about up?  Yet for everything that really annoyed me about CONSTANTINE, there were some definite pluses.  Djimon Hounsou is always good, and Rachel Weisz plays an easy-on-the-eye victim of the forces of Hades.  But I really liked Peter Stormare as a most lascivious Lucifer; Stormare comes along at the knick of time, and saves CONSTANTINE from falling apart.  Yet I still don't know why I give this movie three stars.  Guess the devil made me do it.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

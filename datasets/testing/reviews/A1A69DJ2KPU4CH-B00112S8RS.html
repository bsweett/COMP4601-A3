<meta name="summary" content="A Five Star Film And Then Some!"></head><body><p>I just saw this movie on cable tv and it's one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen.  People rating this movie poorly because it's depressing, because the characters are slimy and because they can't keep up with the time jumps???  Excuse me, where was it written that movies are supposed to be happy go lucky affairs with lovable characters and easy to follow narration?  The negative reviewers probably need to stick with Disney movies which I think will have more of what they're looking for in a movie.<br /><br />If however you want to see a film with phenomenal acting, and with a powerful twist on the common theme of greed/money/drugs corrupting and ruining lives you've found your film.  I was left emotionally exhausted after watching this movie, as I have encountered similar low and dark periods in my life.  The scene where the character played by Philip Hoffman starts randomly knocking stuff over in his apartment on purpose really hit home.  For anyone who's hit a similar low in their life, you'll know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough.  I don't write many reviews on amazon and usually only take the time to do so for something I either really hated or really loved.  Warning, this is not a feel good movie at all!  It is meant to be depressing and the characters are meant to be slimy.  That's life folks.  It would be great if life was like a Walt Disney movie, but it's a big, scary, mean, depressing world out there and this movie does an amazing job of presenting it in all it's glory.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stop talking!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>The only reason I enjoyed this movie was for the good action scenes and because of Laurence Fishburne who was great as usual. But, the movie was kind of dissapointing.<br />It's about a presinct that gets more than it expected on New Year's eve. A group of men invade it showing no mercy and wanting Bishop (Laurencre Fishburne) a bad criminal. But to take him out, they're willing to take out everyone in the presinct. So, all of the prisoners must join with the few cops to resist this mysterious group of people.<br />The movie for is really repetitive and had way too many cuss words. Also, John Leguizamo was SO BLOODY ANNOYING. He just wouldn't shut up, I mean you'll be so annoyed by him and you'll be wishing for him to get shot so that he'll just shut up. Also, Ethan Hawke isn't an actor I like that much so that took into play. There's some descent action and thanks to Laurence Fishburne, it was ok. I wouldn't even rent it because of the repetitive action and stuff and because of John Leguizamo. I mean you don't know what's annoying until you've seen him. So, if I were you, I wouldn't do like I did and stay away from this. Actually, this movie's worth 2 and 1/2 or 3 stars but John Leguizamo just dropped it down a notch.<br />I mean, picture a crying baby who is just crying nonstop. Ok? Well, John Leguizamo is a lot more annoying than that. And at the end of the movie, you'll be thinking: Stop talking!!!!!!<br />But, don't worry John, you didn't ruin the movie! You just made it a lot worse!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hot Fuzz"></head><body><p>Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a perfect cop.  So go that he has been transferred from London to the town of Sandford.  He is making them look bad, and they want him out of their hair.  Upon arrival, he brings big city justice to the small town, until his superior, Inspector Frank Butterman (Broadbent) encourages him to relax a bit.  Angel is partnered with the inspector's son, Danny (Frost), an enthusiastic cop who isn't really that good.  He is fascinated with Angel and the stories he shares.  A sudden rash of deaths in Sandford are put off by the inspector as accidents, but Angel fears something more is happening, and feels that Simon Skinner (Dalton), the local grocery store owner, is behind it.  Angel must get to the bottom of what is going on in Sandford, and find out if Skinner really is the bad guy.<br /><br />"Hot Fuzz" is an excellent and very funny movie.  Pegg and Frost are hilarious together, playing off each other with ease.  There is a long setup that pays off with a final 30 minutes packed with action.  "Hot Fuzz" lampoons the action genre with great skill, and unlike most action movies, there is real character development that makes us care for the duo at the heart of the movie.  Dalton, as the apparent bad guy, seems to be savoring every moment of his screen time.  He is delightfully evil, and about as far from his James Bond days as he has ever been.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  The only drawback is that the movie runs a little too long.  Still, those looking for a smart, funny action-comedy will not be disappointed with "Hot Fuzz".</p></body></html>

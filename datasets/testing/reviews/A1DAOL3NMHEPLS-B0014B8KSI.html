<meta name="summary" content="Top-notch acting in the service of an improbable story"></head><body><p>A Hollywood thriller in which the villains work for a BIG EVIL CORPORATION that is POISONING PEOPLE and trying to COVER IT UP. How original .... not! The acting in this movie is first-rate, but the plot is so wheezy that it's hard to take it all very seriously. And on at least one occasion, Clayton is  saved from peril by what appears to be an arbitrary and unexplained decision: "Gosh, I think I'll get out of my car and go commune with those horses."  Clooney, Wilkinson and Swinton do a fine job of holding your interest and making their characters believable, but the heavy-handed and preachy script keeps intruding. Worth watching, but no landmark.</p></body></html>

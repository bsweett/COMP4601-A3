<meta name="summary" content="Powerhouse Film, Disturbing and Powerful!"></head><body><p>'Taxi Driver' is one of the most passionate films ever made, everyone involved did it with such professionalism and dedication that you can't help but admire it. Scorsese scored big with this one, although this wasn;t  his first masterpiece, 'Mean Streets', another Scorsese triumph was made in  1973. Powerhouse directing by Scorsese, and brilliant screenplay by Paul  Schrader. But the acting is the thing that blows you away. Robert DeNiro  delivers one of the most expertly realized performances of all time, he  'was' Travis Bickle, the ultimate antihero, loneliness and violence have  never mixed so well together. His performance was basically a big  improvisation, the whole 'you talking to me' scene was never staged, that  was pure DeNiro. Travis Bickle is just about the loneliest character in the  history of cinema, and that's what 'Taxi Driver' is all about, basically  loneliness. Also a powerhouse performance by a very young Jodie Foster as a  12 year old prostitute, that's a role that could never be done again, even  now in the 22nd century. Cybill Sheppard and, surprise, Albert Brooks are  also good in support. An unforgettable film that really leaves an impact. A  milestone 70's film. Extras: you can spot Martin Scorsese in the background  in the scene where we first see Cybill Sheppard in her white dress, he also  appears as the psycho whose wife is cheating on him and takes Travis along  for the ride. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!</p></body></html>

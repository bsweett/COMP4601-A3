He was a member of a conspiracy to overthrow the government, but was captured before the plot could be completed.  Under extreme torture he revealed the names of the other conspirators and they were all hung together.  Each year in England and other parts of the British Commonwealth Guy Fawkes day is celebrated on November 5 with bonfires that burn effigies of Guy Fawkes, fireworks, and massive parties.<br /><br />Information like this is not usually needed to enjoy and understand a movie. However, when the movie is as deep, complex, and dark as V FOR VENDETTA the information above is essential to understanding the film.  V FOR VENDETTA is based upon a graphic novel written by Alan Moore.  The movie takes place in a not all that too distant future.  The world is a complex hybrid of George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's A BRAVE NEW WORLD.  Due to a misguided war of domination, the United States is no longer a superpower and Britain is back in control with a new Empire.<br /><br />The country is led (actually ruled) by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt).  Sutler rules the country with an iron hand and makes his ways known to the public through a variety of messages that he broadcasts via huge video screens and across the nation's television network.  The populace seems to have become addicted to amusement and spends the majority of their time watching television. They know that most of the news they hear is actually made up, but they still watch and listen.<br /><br />On a clear night at midnight on November 5th, V (Hugo Weaving) blows up the Banking Building in London.  Later in the day, he hijacks the news station and broadcasts a message to the country asking the citizens to join him in one year from the day when they will begin a revolution, eradicate Parliament, and begin things anew.  "Remember, remember the fifth of November."  While at the television station, V is joined by Evey (Natalie Portman) a woman he saved from being raped and arrested the night before.  Evey is knocked unconscious during the chaos and V brings her back to his secret lair.  As the plot thickens, Evey becomes V's accomplice as he begins killing various government officials who were responsible for secret government killings of their own citizens.  The action rises and falls like the graceful melody of a symphony until the final act when all the game pieces are put into place and checkmate is called.<br /><br />V FOR VENDETTA is based off of a comic book, but it's not like a typical comic book movie.  In most comic book movies, though there might be a great deal of character development there is a ton of action, not a great deal of dialogue, and hardly any serious thinking necessary by the viewer.  V FOR VENDETTA does have a great deal of character development, but other than that and the mask and costume that V wears, that's about the only similarities between this and the average comic book film.  The film is full of serious dialogue, witty diatribes, and monologues full of alliteration.  This wonderful wordplay just isn't amusing; it also forces the audience to think about what the speakers are saying.  Words are meaningful and have power and V FOR VENDETTA does an excellent job of illustrating this.<br /><br />Also, V FOR VENDETTA doesn't really have a traditional hero.  Though it could be argued that Evey is the film's heroine, we don't see her in action or on screen long enough to know whether she is the heroine.  Instead, we are presented with the actions of V and it is he himself that the movie revolves.  It can be argued that V is the hero because he performs some truly heroic actions during the course of the film:  he prevents Evey from being raped, he leads a popular uprising against a tyrannical dictatorship, he fights battles for the average citizens, and he salvages works or Art from destruction.  At the same time, V performs his very heroic deeds through some very dishonorable and ignoble means, for example he murders people and performs acts of massive terrorism.  Many might decide that a character such as V is too much like those who destroyed the World Trade Center and attacked the Pentagon to be a hero.<br /><br />Overall, V FOR VENDETTA is a very entertaining and thought-provoking film.  The film doesn't rely upon action to move the story along, is full of character development, and contains some extraordinary witty wordplay.  I enjoyed the movie and anyone who enjoys an action movie that requires thinking will, too.</p></body></html>

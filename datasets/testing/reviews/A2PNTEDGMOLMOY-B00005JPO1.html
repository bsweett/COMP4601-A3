<meta name="summary" content="Fourth installment can't live up to hype, but hey, it's Indiana Jones!"></head><body><p>I saw "Raiders of the Lost Ark" in the theater when I was 10.<br /><br />That's probably the best disclaimer I can issue regarding my reaction to the worst-titled movie in this series, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."  Indy has been a part of me for as long as I can remember and no movie hero will ever mean as much to me.  How many tedious days did I sit in fourth grade, gazing wistfully out the window as John Williams' perfect theme music played through my head?  I'd imagine myself battling Nazis and searching for fortune and glory, and life was good.  I'd do the same thing in high school, college, grad school . . . I'm half-amazed I didn't become an archeologist.<br /><br />And so it is that I cannot be objective about this movie - I simultaneously love it and regret it.  I love it because it's Indiana Jones.  Harrison Ford may a bit long in the tooth and a a trifle thicker around the waist, but he's still the perfect action hero.  I see his shadow wearily don his trademark fedora, and I feel 10 years old again.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure what happens in this movie - there's something about the Russians, Cate Blanchett, a punk greaser (Shia Lebouef), John Hurt, and the welcome return of Marion.  There are thrilling chases. There are eye-popping visual effects.  There are carnivorous ants - hooray! And there is Indy, swashbuckling through it all.<br /><br />And yet it is so much less than could possibly be expected - we waited 20 years for this?  If Tolkein came back from the dead and wrote another "Lord of the Rings" novel, it wouldn't be as eagerly anticipated as Indy's return.  While that may be unfair, that's the price you pay for creating a defining character in film history.<br /><br />If you love Indiana Jones, get this movie.  You will love it and hate it, and you'll probably watch it again and again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What we've always suspected: High-priced lawyers are the real criminals"></head><body><p>It's unlikely that Michael Clayton will ever be shown in one of Harvard Law School's required ethics-for-lawyers classes (if it has any). We learn far more about the ethical practices of high-priced Wall Street law firms and the corporate lawyers who hire them than the whole well-dressed, well-manicured and well-housed gang would want us to know. And despite the McGuffin being an obvious bit of Hollywood political correctness, and despite being too long with too many extraneous acting bits thrown in for George Clooney, the movie's star, Michael Clayton still delivers the goods as a solid legal conspiracy thriller. Except for all those bits -- Michael's relationship with his angelic son, Michael's relationship with his druggie brother, Michael's relationship with a nice gang messenger, Michael's relationship with poker and Michael's angst over not being made a partner -- the mechanics of the conspiracy and the quality of the acting carries us along. I just wish the movie had been tighter and shorter.<br /><br />George Clooney as Clayton does a superior job that keeps us involved with the story. His job at his law firm has been to clean up messes. He's no miracle worker, he says, he's a janitor. Equally fine performances come from Tom Wilkinson as an attack lawyer, a partner in the law firm where Clayton works, who goes off the rails (when he goes off his meds) and, of all things, starts to help the good guys; Tilda Swinton as the murderous chief counsel for a huge chemical firm which produces an insecticide with an unfortunate side effect, cancer; and Sidney Pollack as the law firm's head, a man who knows what it takes to insure the bills are paid and that he and his lawyers get their bonuses. It's not long before Clayton finds himself up to his torts in hardball lawyering as he tries to deal with a friend who seems to be in the middle of a mental collapse. All the while he's pressured by the needs of a multi-million dollar criminal suit against that chemical company, which his firm is defending. It doesn't help when a couple of blonde assassins enter the scene.<br /><br />The PC nature of the McGuffin -- killer chemicals sold by a huge industrial company -- reeks of Hollywood righteousness. For me, it was irritating. I certainly don't recommend trusting big companies any more than I'd recommend trusting high priced lawyers, but I wanted a thriller, not a lecture by rich Hollywood writers and stars. Besides, Erin Brockovich had already mined that chemical load earlier. To the movie's credit, not much time is spent with the McGuffin itself. It provides the cause of the plot, but it could have been just about anything. What helps us forget the PC nature of the McGuffin is the quality acting by Clooney, Wilkinson, Swinton and Pollack. There's not a scene in the movie that does not have at least one of them in it. Separately and together in any combination, they hook us into whatever plot development they're showing us.<br /><br />The lessons I drew from Michael Clayton:<br />--If you're the head of a law firm, make sure your lawyers stay on their meds.<br />--If you're a lawyer, there are better things for your career than murdering a person's body...such as murdering the person's reputation and character. And it pays just as well.<br />--If you can ignore the message of the McGuffin and minimize your involvement in all the angst in Michael Clayton's life, Michael Clayton the movie is darn good.</p></body></html>

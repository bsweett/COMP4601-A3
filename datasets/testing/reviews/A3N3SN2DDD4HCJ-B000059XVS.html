<meta name="summary" content="A Grand, Thrilling Epic."></head><body><p>&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is one of the great epics. A film that is captivating in its scope and grandeur. Director David Lean has here his best film. It is a remarkably well-made film with a fantastic screenplay by Robert Bolt and dynamic performances by Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif. But what makes the film a masterpiece aside from the great dramatic elements, is the incredible visual quality. The vistas are breathtaking and it will be a very long time before anyone films the desert like Lean did with this film. It is even more breathtaking a movie to watch when you know this was released in 1962, long before computer graphics were essential to visuals. Everything is REAL, alive and thundering. And whatever beautiful visual side-effects we see in the sand or caused by the heat caught in the background by the lenses, is quite natural too. The action sequences are also great to this day. This film is epic and grand, heroic and exhilarating yet beautifully artistic. And there is of course, the romantic, wonderous musical score by Maurice Jarre. It is one of the great masterpieces of the cinema. A true classic that still stands the test of time. This new DVD edition is fantastic and the making-of documentary is fascinating and very informative. It is a worthy treatment. Here is one of the truly great films.</p></body></html>

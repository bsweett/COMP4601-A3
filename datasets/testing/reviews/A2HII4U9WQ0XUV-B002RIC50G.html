I'd rather lead war elephants out of my bazungulus than watch this mouse-salad sandwich of a flick again.<br /><br />Call it "Young Hannibal", "Hannibal Boring", or---Hey---Hannibal was Cannibal, when Cannibal wasn't cool---whatever you call it, this slow yellow busride on the flesh-chomping Wayback Machine proposes to jump back into the murky Lithuanian past of everyone's famous little killer shrink: Little Hannibal Lecter.<br /><br />Left alone in the Gothic schoolroom of his parent's ancient, moldering castle in the woods north of Vilnius, Little Hannibal looks at the little food pyramid chart hanging up on the wall.<br /><br />"YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT" it says.<br /><br />Little Hannibal frowns. Later at dinner at the long table in the ancient Dining Hall, Hannibal stares at his plate: some venison with a cranberry glaize. Some boiled, chopped carrots. A slab of whitefish. Peas. Leafy greens. He looks up at Mommy Lecter.<br /><br />"Mummy, am I a carrot?" he asks. "No darling."<br /><br />"A pea?" Not at all my sweet.<br /><br />"A potato?" I think not. "A little deer?" Absolutely not, my darling Hannibal.<br /><br />"Then what am I, Mummy?" the little boy wails, in a fit of bewilderment.<br /><br />"Why my sweet, sweet child, you're a little boy. You're a human being, Hannibal."<br /><br />The rest, as they say, is history, which should also have described this movie's fate in pre-production.<br /><br />SHORT REVIEW, or, WHADDYU GUYS WANT AS AN APPETIZER?: Avoid. Plays out like Hitler Week on the History channel, only with People-Eating! I mean, honest to God, how do you make a movie about a serial killer cannibal psychiatrist boring? Ask director Peter Webber, he did it.<br /><br />LONG REVIEW, or, PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO EAT PEOPLE, ARE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. The little nihlist spin Jon Demme gave "The Phantom of the Opera" could be summarized in three words: nasty, shocking, evil. When I first saw it, for a few weeks I recommended it be burned. The effect of that chicken-skin netherworld of inky-black grue was like standing in a meat locker and having a spitting black electric eel, its skin still slick with tepid water, dumped down your pants.<br /><br />"Silence of the Lambs" felt like pure Evil because it was meant to: it was a bleak nightworld highway of Hell with no offramps. The audience was dumped into a world where sanity stood on its head. Hannibal Lecter, society psychiatrist, was the very epitome of that film's brutal wrongness: a finely concocted, meticulously educated, disarmingly sophisticated monster whose refinement only serves as a pressure cooker for the ferocity and savagery lurking just within the urbane exterior.<br /><br />Take any two minutes of grandmaster Anthony Hopkins's performance: it practically bristles a perfectly modulated, barely contained menace.<br /><br />That menace---that sense of a hinged trapped set to spring on naught but a muscle tremor---is totally absent in "Hannibal Rising": Young Sherlock Hannibal (French actor Gaspard Ulliel, who probably does a fine job when he's talking Frog) bristles with all the menace of a cow-eyed virgin schoolboy visiting Europe for the first time. The only time Ulliel really rises to the occasion is when he gets all jiggy with a samurai mask and sword. And then, only for a moment.<br /><br />And it's really not even poor Mr. Ulliel's fault that "Hannibal Boring" struggles to breathe and dies on the slab: more than anything it's the flick's whole schizophrenic struggle to humanize a guy who likes nothing better than a little Homo Sapiens pate with his champagne breakfest. Hey, who are we to judge! The SS ate his sister! Imagine what a little kidney-biting could have done for Schindler's List!<br /><br />Nor can you blame the screenwriter for the flaccid storyline: lay that at writer Thomas Harris's door, an author who hasn't had magic in his typewriter since, well, ever. Harris's backstory to his foodie supervillain was: Hannibal, budding Lithuanian aristocrat, has to deal with World War 2! Hannibal loses baby sister to some fascists with, uhm, diverse palates! Hannibal makes it through, baby! Hannibal gets even, along with a nice first edition copy of Julia Child's "Joy of Cooking".<br /><br />At the end of the day, though, "Hannibal Sleeping" fails because it spends all its time answering the most tiresome question of our dull Age: "Why". Asking "Why?" is a nice long drive up Nowhere Lane. Why did the big bad man capture a schoolbus full of little kids, cut them up into a million pieces, and airmail all the parts to Guam?<br /><br />Why is pointless: why not? (the central question in "Silence of the Lambs") is far more amusing. Why does there need to be a why? Sexuality leads us to the precipice from which we may view the futility of the question, where why is buried beneath thrashy seconds, minutes, hours, days of sweaty insanity and pheremonal depravity.<br /><br />Why? Because it feels good, Clarisse.<br /><br />Which can't be said of this flop. "Hannibal Rising" is zero red meat and lots of tofu, sprouts, and sushsi: fifteen minutes later and you'll be hungry again.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

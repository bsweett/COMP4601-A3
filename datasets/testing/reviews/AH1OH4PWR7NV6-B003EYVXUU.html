<meta name="summary" content="It is not a scary movie."></head><body><p>I really thought this would be a good horror movie I could add to my collection.  Sadly, it is just a good movie with some gore in it.  A bit predictable as well.  Thankfully it is not a sappy movie like "Twilight" and unfortunately not scary like "A Haunting in Connecticut."  So what, the vampire child gives the wimpy kid some advise on dealing with bullies, it really did not work.  And as predicted, she comes to his defense in the end.  Stephen King added his two cents "the best horror movie in 20 years."  Really???  It is just a good story.  Some of the reviews on Amazon say that the American remake has more special effects.  If that is true, then I won't waste my time watching the original.  Kids are great in creepy movies and have the potential to make the movie that much more creepier or fun.  This movie failed at both ends.  It was just a good story with an open end.</p></body></html>

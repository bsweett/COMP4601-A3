<meta name="summary" content="One movie that will surely make you admire Ray Charles..."></head><body><p>Ray is the story of the legendary Ray Charles, a man who went blind at the age of 7 but still managed to become of the greatest music icons of jazz and others in the world. Jamie Fox plays Ray and does a great job showing the emotion of how one man went for everything he wanted, managed to get it, but almost lost it when drugs and the need for women entered his life. This is one movie that needs to be seen for someone who wan'ts some inspiration of their own.<br /><br />Ray Charles was born in a poor African American neighborhood in Florida. After going blind at a very young age, it seemed like he would not accomplish anything at all. But with the help of his strong supporting mother, Ray went on to challenge racism in the music world, became a smash hit, and almost went overboard after realizing that women and drugs offered a lot more excitement than the top of the music world.<br /><br />Some people compared this to Jonny Cash's movie, Walk the Line. I think both are extremely well done movies, and this is one movie that needs to be seen in order to fully understand what one man had to go through to reach his goals in life.<br /><br />Extras include:<br /><br />Commentary by Director Taylor Hackford<br /><br />14 deleted scenes<br /><br />"Ray Remembered" [A look at the real Ray Charles]<br /><br />9 additional music performances<br /><br />"The Women of Ray"<br /><br />And a small booklet showing the life of Ray Charles<br /><br />This is one DVD you need to see.<br /><br />Highly Recommended</p></body></html>

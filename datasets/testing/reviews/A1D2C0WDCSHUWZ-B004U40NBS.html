<meta name="summary" content="Black feathers"></head><body><p>Darren Aronofsky is really the master of uncomfortable films. They are brilliant, but they make you want to squirm in your seat.<br /><br />So expect nothing less from "Black Swan," a sublimely horrific psychological thriller. Aronofsky crafts the delicate, dark tale of a fragile young woman's descent into insanity, and Natalie Portman pours every ounce of her skill into the role. It's a beautiful tangle of ballet, classical music, black wings and warping reality.<br /><br />The lead dancer (Winona Ryder) of a New York ballet company is hospitalized, so a new dancer is needed for "Swan Lake" -- a girl who can play both the pure White Swan and the sensual Black Swan. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) desperately wants to dance the role, especially since her controlling stage mother (Barbara Hershey) has always driven her to be "perfect." Many other girls want the role, including the new girl Lily (Mila Kunis).<br /><br />But even after Nina wins the role, she doesn't find any peace. She begins to believe that Lily is trying to steal the role of a lifetime, and is tormented by strange voices and hallucinations -- and spiky little feather start sprouting from her shoulders. And as her debut approaches, Nina begins sliding further into a nightmarish world where she IS the Black Swan.<br /><br />In his previous movies, Darren Aronofsky has explored psychological grotesquerie or exquisite beauty... but I don't think he's ever melded the two as he does in "Black Swan." This movie is a nightmare -- a graceful, satin-swathed, feathered, mirrored nightmare, full of strange images (screaming pictures) and haunting moments that make you want to hide.<br /><br />At the movie's start, there's a vague sense of unease and instability, as if something nightmarish is lurking right around the corner. But with every successive scene, Aronofsky painstakingly slips in more and more surreality and creepiness, until you find yourself locked in Nina's living hell. It all climaxes in a brilliant juxtaposition of dance, death, beauty and horror.<br /><br />The freakiest parts of it may be the changes to Nina's body, namely her backwards "swan legs" and the feathers on her back. Is her madness changing her body? Is it just another hallucination? It takes awhile to figure out.<br /><br />The lead role is one of those roles that demands all the passion, skill and life that an actor can pour into it, and Natalie Portman gives the role everything she has -- her Nina is a trembling, fragile creature made out of glass, who begins to crack under pressure. Mila Kunis gives a subtle, strong performance as Lily (both in and out of Nina's head), and there are great side performances by Hershey, Ryder, and Vincent Cassel.<br /><br />"Black Swan" is a movie that lulls you into a beautiful nightmare, and leaves you trying to unravel what is madness and what is reality. It's uncomfortable to watch, but it's supposed to be.</p></body></html>

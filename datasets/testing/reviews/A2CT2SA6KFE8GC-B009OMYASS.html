Well, it's a big deal coz horror films like this don't tend to make their way into the mainstream much.  In fact, I wouldn't say Hostel is a horror film in the traditional sense, but considering the subject matter, what other category would you put in in?  It's horror in the same way that Last House On The Left is horror in that you get people senselessly tortured and killed, and a little revenge thrown in at the end.  Everyone who hated this film is very quick to point out that "it wasn't even scary".  Well, lets cut through the B.S. for a moment.  Since you were a child, have you really seen a movie that was actually scary?  I know I certainly haven't.  Entertaining, yes.  Creepy?  Disturbing?  Yes.  But no movie has ever made me afraid to walk around my home in the dark.  No, Hostel isn't scary, but it is disturbing.  All the tough guys out there are also quick to point out that it's not as gory as it's reputation would have you believe.  True, it's no Cannibal Holocaust, but we are talking about a mainstream film here.  Horror fans won't see gore they haven't seen before, but folks who occasionally dabble in mainstream horror films will probably get a smack in the face with this film.  I think the gore was in an acceptable amount, and handled well.  A movie packed with gore , while entertaining, is far from scary and usually becomes a parody.  Peter Jackson's Dead Alive is a no holds barred gorefest, but the film's hilarious.  Hostel tries to treat it's violence seriously.  The reactions to the violence from the main characters are realistic-they react with terror, disgust and pain.  While the acting from the leads in this film won't get oscars, you have to admire how well they switch from dumb comedy stereotypes to frightened helpless human beings.  Their lameness in the first 45 minutes is almost forgiven.  If these same characters were in a slasher flick, you'd be rootin' for their deaths and cheer when they came.  The intensity of their performances in the torture chamber are good enough that they become human, and while you don't actually care for them exactly(this is only a movie after all, it's not like they're in any real danger) , you don't really want to see them die this way.  The film does a decent job with suspense in the first hour when the guys are starting to catch wind that something wrong is happening.  In fact, the buildup is actually better than the payoff.  The actual torture chamber scenes only take up about ten minutes of the film.  After escaping his room, the main character tries to find his way out of the building(the overall look of the factory is actually quite stellar).  Some decent suspense here, but it kinda plays out like a stealth mission from a video game like Manhunt or Hitman.  Once out, the guy gets the Charles Bronson bug and wants to get a bit of revenge.  This was cool also.  Considering this character was the wisecracker of the bunch, it's neat to see him so serious for the rest of the film.  It would have been so easy to have him deliver some smartass comment to his assailants, and that would have been awful.  Most likely it would have happened that way too if it had been a bigger production.  Folks seem to think the ending was a letdown as well.  Well, I guess every film can't end with a big explosion and twenty minute chase through the streets of Slovakia, which I'm sure Jerry Schmuckheimer would have provided if this was his production.  The ending may have been anticlimatic, but it seemed more realistic to me.  In fact, anyone who would escape such an ordeal would simply run away and not look back, and not even bother messing with the torture people anymore.  The only big mistake Roth made was with that gang of little kids who kill a couple of guys when payed in candy.  This was actually quite stupid and ruined what up to that point was a serious film.  Overall, Hostel is actually a good film when you consider the current state of mainstream horror films.  There's no MTV/Attention Defecit Disorder style editing, and thank God it's not a remake of a great classic horror film.  The humor was more miss than hit if you ask me.  I've also never been a big fan of sex and nudity.  Folks  who hate this seem to always point out the nudity as a redeeming quality to the film, but I always figured if a movie sucked it sucked, nudity or not.  I can't watch a bad film even if it's wall to wall breasts.  Yes, it was a bit excessive in the sex department.  If I want nudity, there are other types of films I prefer to see it in(they're usually in the back of the video store and come in black dvd cases kept behind the counter).  It's certainly not a film I would purchase, but I'd have no problem with watching it again.  Best horror film we'll see come out of the mainstream for awhile.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pushes Boundaries of Horror"></head><body><p>In all films I have seen, including horror, there is an unwritten rule: men and maybe some women can be killed, but kids and dogs survive.  AVP Requiem ends that rule.  The aliens who invade a rural Colorado town act like aliens, and there are some mighty disturbing scenes.  DO NOT let anyone with an infant, or if they are pregnant, SEE THIS MOVIE.  This rule-breaking made the movie more gripping and realistic.  The alien beasts are great, but the human acting left much to be desired.<br /><br />The film is so dark, that even with only one light on, I could not see what was going on.  You need to turn off all your lights, and even then, you squint at parts.<br /><br />The blood really flows in this one, and the Predator is fantastic.  I sincerely hope that this "Requiem" will not be the last.  The way the movie ended leaves it wide open for a third one.</p></body></html>

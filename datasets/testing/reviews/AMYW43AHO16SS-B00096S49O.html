However, Will Smith shows that he can take any acting role given to him and make it work.  He's become a veteran entertainer.  This film surprised me.  Kevin James (King of Queens) is hilarious as the accountant, trying to win the heart of his boss.  Eva Mendes is a lovely presence on the screen as the gossip columnist who uncovers Hitch's secret.  The story is wonderful, original and doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's a refreshing change of pace and will entertain all who watch.</p></body></html>

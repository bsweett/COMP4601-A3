<meta name="summary" content="One of Tom Hanks' Best Films"></head><body><p>In this fine Prohibition-era film, Tom Hanks plays a mob hit man who, throughout the course of the film, transforms his life from killing to caring.  Michael Sullivan (Hanks) is the right-hand man for crime boss John Rooney, played superbly by veteran actor Paul Newman.  But when Sullivan's young son Michael Jr., played by Tyler Hoechlin, witnesses one of his father's hits, he must choose between his real family and his crime family.<p>Upon finding out that Sullivan's son witnessed the hit, Rooney's son Connor, played by Daniel Craig, has Sullivan's wife Annie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and son Peter (Liam Athen) killed.  This fills Michael with rage and revenge against his former crime family, but also fills him with a new-found sense of love and responsibility for his son Michael Jr.<p>The acting throughout the film is excellent.  Hanks turns in one of his best acting performances as Sullivan, while timeless Paul Newman is wonderful as John Rooney.  Jude Law is also a standout as Maguire, a chilling hit man/photographer.  I would rate this film on the level of other Hanks films such as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.  You must watch the film carefully and let the story develop, but the ending is worth the wait.</p></body></html>

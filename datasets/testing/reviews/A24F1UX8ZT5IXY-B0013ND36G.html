<meta name="summary" content="THIS FILM HAS 2 PLOTS : 1 good, 1 bad...."></head><body><p>I am going to talk about the writing of this film, as there are 700 + reviews about Arnold, etc.<br /><br />First of all, there are two plots sandwiched together here. One is that of the Terminatrix, and the other is of Judgement Day. The two have little to do with one another. The fact that they happen within the same 24 hours, is not, and I repeat, is not a key element in the story, even if the writers try to trick you into thinking it is.<br /><br />I believe the Terminatrix female is a disaster. In her red leather suit, her overly-emotive head tilts etc., it's high camp, and often non-sensical (why would she jump onto the hearse when she could just blow it away with the plasma cannon?)... This portion of the film is a very pale shadow of the first two villains; and it is the driving force of the action portions of these films.<br /><br />The second plot involves the capitulation of America's Armed Forces over to Skynet, and I think this was accomlished quite well. I give any movie credit that pulls of a science fiction feat of this magnitude with such aplomb. Nick Stahl greatly assists in making this conceit believable. This is the true story of the film, and makes for all of the best scenes, including the excellent twist at the end. By then, the Terminatrix is just an afterthought.<br /><br />I would, however, like to point out some pretty big flaws:<br /><br />Nick Stahl seeking refuge in the clinic the same night that the Terminators come back to town, only to meet up with Claire Danes... is a ridiculous coincidence that is not a predicate to the story working properly; it is necessary just to get them together.<br /><br />Remember, that he meets up with her less than 24 hours before the end of the world, the same day the Terminators are sent back in time... when of course they could have been sent back at any time...catch my drift?<br /><br />Why would the Terminatrix want to assassinate the General? Answer: because or else she would not be in the final action scenes. He is not one of Connor's lieutenants and he was unable to stop Skynet's reign in any scenario. BAD.<br /><br />How could the kids escape in that Cessna with battle drones all over the place launching missles, etc?<br /><br />I do think that it makes sense that John Connor became important precisely because he met Claire Danes and her dad is this General. Otherwise he would just be a valley kid. But, this is not really explained clearly. And we would need a lot more backstory to make this element work.<br /><br />Overall, some great ideas that are not fully developed. I think most people who saw the film just sai "hey cool" and let these big loopholes go unpunished.</p></body></html>

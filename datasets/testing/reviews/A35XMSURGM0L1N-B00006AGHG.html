Jackson plays an alcoholic who wants his children back and Affleck plays a lawyer on Wall Street. Evryone around him is urging him to bend the rules to get things done, something he regrets in the end.<p>it's a good thriller with almost no violence, explosions etc. It's worth seeing, also to see what a great actor Jackson is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""When Christmas Comes to Town""></head><body><p>The POLAR EXPRESS is the picture of the year in IMAX 3-D.  I can't imagine how it might look any other way.  The compositions would be the same, but the dimensionality of the movie really floors you, knocks you out, and I think perhaps the 3-effects help you enjoy Alan Silvestri's music more, even down to the magical sleighbells that our little hero cannot hear.<br /><br />The songs are to be cherished.  I couldn't make out the lyrics of the choral number, "The Spirit of the Season," but it is something I would like to have the choir in my church sing during their rehearsals for the Nutcracker Suite.  One of my favorite music numbers is the bizarre, minimal "Hot Chocolate" barked out by Tom Hanks and a chorus of singing waiters in a take off of an old Cotton Club/Cab Calloway style.  Hanks really doesn't have a good singing voice, does he, and he's straining himself trying to get through a number even where all he has to say is, "Hot, hot," a dozen times.  In general when Hanks was off the screen I liked the movie better.  I couldn't help but think that he was hogging up all the action by trying to put his brand on every male character in the show, right down to the evil Scrooge puppet, and trying to play one character and the father to that character is stupid, if you ask me, but they say Warner Brothers paid him $25 million dollars to play in the show, so maybe they figured they would milk him for all he's worth.  Peter Sellers used to play many characters-and Alec Guinness-I didn't like it when they did it either, to tell you the truth.<br /><br />Steven Tyler from Aerosmith has a few cute moments as an elf singing, "Rocking On Top Of The World."<br /><br />The movie has you in tears from approximately 40:15 on.  When the little black girl and the poor boy who's afraid of Christmas disappointment, get together at the back of the club car and sing, "When Christmas Comes To Town," it is the signal to unleash all the tears you've ever wanted to shed about the world's injustice and also the beauty of the world that the young girl seems to be arguing in favor of.  If the Christmas season can produce such wonderful feelings of love, then it is a shame it cannot last all year.</p></body></html>

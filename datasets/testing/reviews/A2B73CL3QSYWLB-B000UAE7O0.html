Well, Robert Rodriguez's flick is the polar opposite of that self-indulgent mess.  Rodriguez inherently understands that the whole grindhouse experience is about fun and he delivers it in buckets.  Whereas Tarantino had to spell out in capital letters his influences(we filmgoers can't be as knowledgable as the former video store clerk), Rodriguez references the work of George Romero and Tobe Hooper with maybe a touch of Sam Peckinpah without rubbing our noses in it.  For sure there's a lot of gore here but Rodriguez presents it in such a hilarious tongue-in-cheek manner that you're never repulsed by it.  Rose McGowan gives a star-making turn here and she has a classic beauty that reminded me of a latter day Rita Hayworth.  I also liked Josh Brolin as a physician treating the infected.  Brolin is a terrific actor and you should check him out as the heavy in the underrated "Into the Blue".  Rodriguez with this film and "Sin City" puts himself in the first tier of American directors if only the critics would get over their aversion of the genres he works in.  On a final note will somebody make a full-length version of "Machete", the film trailer that stars Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin.</p></body></html>

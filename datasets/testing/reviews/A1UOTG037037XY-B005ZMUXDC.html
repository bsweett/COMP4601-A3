<meta name="summary" content="so much better than The Princess and The Frog."></head><body><p>There was too much frog and not enough of Disney's First Black Princess in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034JKZ86">The Princess and the Frog (Single-Disc Edition)</a>.  Since Tangled came after The Princess and the Frog, Tangled as a superior product makes it appear as though Disney didn't do their best with The Princess and the Frog.<br /><br />Tangled is satisfying modern successor to the classic Disney Princess animated films and I recommend it without reservation.  Not only does Rapunzel's appearance and situation remind one of the Stolen Children of Poland but also China where the Chinese floating lanterns represent our yearning for our stolen children whom the Japanese chose if they were captured from elite familes (i.e. "princesses") to be sold as gristle for their goblin attempts at boosting Chinese medicines for their own desire for enhanced "vitality," sold at sex auctions to both sadistic Japanese men and women and to be thrown down silver mines in Japan where the American, British and Australian POWs found their corpses lining the tunnels.  Grown men found themselves standing on top of children's bodies just as the recovery workers experienced at the site of the World Trade Center.<br /><br />And if you want to know who the Evil Goth(!)el is modeled after, at least her distinctive TORSO is modeled after Yoko Ono's.  Google Images for the former classmate and candidate for wife of Akihito to confirm with your own eyes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="How the Heist Was Done"></head><body><p>INSIDE MAN opens with a bank robber, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) explaining that he has just robbed a bank.  The who, what, when, where, and why are questions that everyone already knows the answers to.  What people don't know is the how.  The movie then illustrates just how Russell was able to complete his master heist.<br /><br />Russell and his gang begin their caper by entering a premier bank in New York posing as painters.  They shine lights at the cameras, lock the doors, reveal their weapons, and announce that a robbery is in progress.  Confusion mounts as the robbers dress those in the bank in identical costumes.  Along the way, a game of wits is played between Russell and Det. Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington).  Frazier knows Russell is up to something but he just can't figure out what.  Hired into the game by the owner of the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), is independent "fixer" Madeline White (Jodie Foster).  White's presence seems unnecessary for most of the movie, but she adds a wild card into the whole scenario that cannot be ignored.  The fun part is trying to figure out just how it's all going to play out in the end and how Russell is able to escape with a fortune, but no stolen money and without being caught.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN has a great cast with some fabulous acting.  Washington, Foster, and Plummer are magnificent as always, but stronger performances are given by some of the film's supporting actors, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor as Frazier's assistant Bill Mitchell and Waris Ahluwalia as Vikram Walia, a Sikh hostage who when released from the bank is at first thought to be a terrorist.<br /><br />For a heist picture, INSIDE MAN moves rather slowly.  Yet, at the slower pace the movie never really drags.  Also, scattered throughout the movie are moments of social commentary-such as when Russell speaks with a young boy in the bank during the heist about the hand held video game he is playing.  Beside the commentary, these moments also provide greater depth to the characters we see on the screen.<br /><br />Overall, INSIDE MAN is an enjoyable heist picture.  It's a movie that a wide audience can relate to.  It isn't Spike Lee's best picture, but it is his most commercial.</p></body></html>

I know this film is an allegory that lays it's sentiments on a little thick but I am completely hooked.  Credit has to be given to Frank Darabont for his excellent direction for allowing this story, adapted from a Stephen King novella, to unfold slowly, but not excrutiatingly so, to a satisfying conclusion.  Darabont, to his credit, has assembled a first-rate cast to enact this tale.  The always solid Tom Hanks shines as Paul Edgecomb, the stolid head guard of "the mile".  Michael Clarke Duncan as the condemned John Coffey, a role that on paper borders on the one-dimensional, shines and gives the film it's heart and soul.  Excellent support is offered here by Bonnie Hunt, David Morse, Barry Pepper, James Cromwell,Gary Sinise, and Patricia Clarkson.  Special mention should be made for the late Michael Jeter who sympathetically portrays one of the condemned prisoners.  My only real gripe about the cast is Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell as the film's ostensible heavies.  These parts either as written or portrayed are a little over the top.  "The Green Mile" sure is long but it is well worth an investment of your time.</p></body></html>

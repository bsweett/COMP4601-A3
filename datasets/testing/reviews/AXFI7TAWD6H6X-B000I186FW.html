<meta name="summary" content="Thoroughly entertaining"></head><body><p>I never read the graphic novel that the film "V for Vendetta" was based in. I heard about the comparisons to the current political climate but I went into this film as that it was merely entertainment. I did not go in with any pre-conceived notions or political agenda.<br /><br />After the artistically disasterous Matrix trilogy (sorry, all three films were three too many), the Wachowski brothers return to the big screen with a vengenece with the explosive "V for Vendetta". The setting takes place in the future where the United States is no longer the lone superpower on the planet and is in a complete disarray. Britain has now taken over the US's role. Along the way John Hurt's character Adam Sutler has risen to power and became a totalitarian dictator. Hugo Weaving plays a mysterious figure named V who hides behind a mask. His intentions are to bring down Adam Sutler and his cronies. Natalie Portman is Evey, a young woman who accidently gets caught up in V's escapades when V rescues her from some strangers who tries to attack her.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film a bit. The action sequences and the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved listening to Hugo Weaving speak through the mask so eloquently. It was quite a departure from his villainous role in the Matrix series. I loved the diversity in the music which ranged from orchestral to modern day indie pop (Cat Power). The film isn't completely perfect. I thought some scenes tended to drag on longer than they should have been but overall I enjoyed "V for Vendetta" as a whole.</p></body></html>

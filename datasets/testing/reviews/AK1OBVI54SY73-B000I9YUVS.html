<meta name="summary" content="Average Beginning and Middle...Then Just A Lousy Ending"></head><body><p>All right in the first hour of this movie I was bored yes but I didn't think on baring my critical fangs yet for the movie was average at least for a horror film. The characters were boring nonetheless and really did not interest me. The storyline itself behind the Fog was pretty good though but it could not save the ending of this film, which was really lousy and to me made hardly any sense.<br /><br />Take my advice, and many others I assume will say the same thing- get the older version. The older version is way better and so is the ending. The actors are even better in the older version. This remake is poor compared to the old one so please do not think the old version is as bad as the remake because it isn't- it is a whole lot better trust me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not-So-Simple Revenge..."></head><body><p>Locked in a windowless room, w/ only a television for company, a man grows increasingly cold and vengeful. He lives only for the day of his escape, when he can find and destroy those responsible for his imprisonment. Then, after 15 long years, he is unceremoniously released. No explanation. No reason for the bizarre incarceration. So begins this man's quest to solve the greatest, darkest mystery of his life, and to get the answer to WHY any of it has happened. Also, WHO would do such a thing, going through so much trouble, expense, and planning in order to imprison one man? He WILL find out, but the answer just might be worse than anything he has yet endured. OLDBOY is far from any typical revenge story. It's a savage, bleak twist on the genre, like AUDITION was to the romantic comedy. As w/ AUDITION, it is best to know absolutely nothing about OLDBOY before viewing it. Avoid ALL spoilers...</p></body></html>

At 31, most professional boxers have been and done the best of their careers. Maggie doesn't care. All she wants to do is box.<br /><br />Trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) goes to church every day, reads books to expand his mind and writes his estranged daughter once a week hoping she'll write back. Frankie has never trained a woman before and has no desire to start now.<br /><br />Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman) is a retired boxer who has a room in the back of Frankie's gym. He cleans up after the boxers and provides moral support and direction to Frankie who stood by him during his last fight when his manager was off having a good time somewhere else. He thinks Frankie should train Maggie and he loves Maggie's tenacity.<br /><br />Maggie pretty much camps out on Frankie's door step (gym) until he agrees to train her. Their relationship immediately extends beyond that of trainer and trainee to daughter and father figure. These three make up an unlikely but solid family unit.<br /><br />MDB was nothing like what I was expecting. I expected a female Rocky and ended up with an intense emotional drama with the usual specs of humour Eastwood provides. The uplifting quality of watching someone train to be the best they can be is present but not the main focus. Family, love, loss, determination, friendship, loyalty, betrayal are all prominent themes. MDB was wonderfully shot and acted. They deserved the 7 academy nominations and 4 wins they received. This movie is definitely worth adding to your Eastwood/Swank/Freeman collection. Bring tissues.</p></body></html>

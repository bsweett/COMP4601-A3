<meta name="summary" content="In Defence Of George Lucas"></head><body><p>A lot of people are complaining about the new editions of these Indiana Jones dvds simply because they have been released before.  They are acting as though George Lucas is the only man guilty of double dipping.  But I turn around and there is the 9th edition of Independence Day, the 5th edition of the Rambo movies (Soon to be 6th)  The many times Terminator 2 has been re-issued on DVD, and don't get me started on the Evil Dead movies.  The Star Wars movies are distributed on DVD by 20th Century Fox, the same studio which, less than a year after the initial release, cranked out a special edition of The Day After Tomorrow, and which annually re-issues not just Day After Tomorrow and Independence dDay, but Speed, the Die Hard movies, the Abyss, The Sound of Music, and the Alien movies on an annual basis, every year with new cover art, and sometimes with bonus features, sometimes without.  The Indiana Jones movies are distributed by Paramount, which has released at least 2 editions of each of the Star Trek movies, and I am certain that when the new Star Trek movie gets released, we can anticipate a 3rd release of those features, either when Star Trek XI is released theatrically or on DVD.  This summer there is going to be a new 2 disk edition of Batman Begins getting released (I wonder if it will be the same as the old 2 disk edition of Batman Begins) in order to capitalize on the release of The Dark Knight.  This isn't really a marketing ploy by Lucas so much as standard marketing procedure on the part of the studios.  So, everyone who gave this a 1 star for being a re-release, quick, get to the new edition of Batman Begins and give that a 1 star review as well.</p></body></html>

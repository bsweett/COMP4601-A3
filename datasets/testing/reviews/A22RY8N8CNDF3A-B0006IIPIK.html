<meta name="summary" content="Forties Film Noir and Sci-Fi Adventure"></head><body><p>The film is a gumbo mix of adventures that resemble a 1940's War Film, Star Trek, Indiana Jones and Wizard of Oz.  There is much action and adventure for a light plot, but the stars, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie give the weak plot a boost and the cinematography is beyond reproach.<br /><br />Kerry Conran is the director and writer -  this is his first film. The retro touches of old brands like Double Bubble Gum and Coca Cola gave it a nostalgic touch.  The hero is Joe Sullivan "Sky Captain" (Jude Law) who is a pilot.  His former flame, Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltro) comes back into his life.  She makes a deal with him for a story in her newspaper.<br /><br />The mystery and plot surround a group of missing scientists and recent robot attacks on New York City.  There is an intricate scheme that may cause the end of the world.  It involves a spacecraft that will send two of each earth species into space - a Noah's Arc Star Liner of sorts.<br /><br />The beauty of the film makes the simple plot watchable.  Gorgeous visuals and special effects give a simple nostalgic effect.  You often think the stars resemble the likes of Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacal, Veronica Lake depending on the scenes.  There are smart lines that remind you of the era of Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon and their tin can space ships.  The movie is done mostly in burnished browns with light color showing through.  Facial close-ups must have camera filters and lighting is perfect.  It is clearly mostly computer generated, but well done art and creativity throughout.<br /><br />For a adventure filled action film, with retro touches, and top stars, this is a good pick.</p></body></html>

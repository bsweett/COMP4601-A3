<meta name="summary" content="Impressive Visuals, However. . ."></head><body><p>THE WOLFMAN looks like a grand horror/thriller.  Dark forests shrouded in mist.  Gothic mansions set in pale moonlight.  Stop-action photography, innovative camera angles, goose bump-inducing special effects.  This is a well crafted film very much worth watching--just prepare yourself for an uneven, if not completely superfluous, story.<br /><br />So much could be gleamed from the basic plot--the anguish, agony, and torment once Lawrence Talbot (a gloom-stricken Benicio Del Toro) learns he is a werewolf, doomed to kill and maim under each full moon.  Instead, this compelling story line is distorted and sidetracked by a romance never fully vetted, an inspector who constantly gets in the way, and by an aloof, eccentric father (don't get me wrong, Anthony Hopkins is his customary brilliant self) who has a showdown with his son that is nothing more than a howler.  (Pardon the pun.)  Accordingly we have a story that never finds a rhythm, that kicks and bucks and sputters and careens into silliness.  True, THE WOLFMAN looks good; it just doesn't have the story to be good.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

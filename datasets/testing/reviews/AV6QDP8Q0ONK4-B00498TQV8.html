<meta name="summary" content="BRAVO"></head><body><p>The plot is fairly simple. Ree Holly (Jennifer Lawrence) is at home taking care of her mother, who takes happy pills and is menatlly out of it. She also cares for her two siblings. She is 17. She goes to school and chops wood too. Clarence Carter's "Patches" lived in a dream world compared to her. Her father is missing and it appears he will miss bail. The family farm has been put up for bond. Ree searches for her father, who made and sold Meth.<br /><br />The movie is shot on location in Southern Missouri, Jesse James country. It captures impoverished rural America. The accents are remarkably well done and not overdone like so many films. Jennifer Lawrence gives us an Academy Award performance. The movie also captures the independent spirit of the people, their general disdain of law enforcement, and their willingness to help each other in a time of crisis, in spite of a certain code of silence.<br /><br />Like many small isolated communities, most folk are somehow kin. Ree uses the kin card to elicit help. Her uncle, who refused to help her, eventually does so after Ree displays bravery and persistence. Remarkable performances by the entire cast, including the child actors. There are no super heroes walking tall or high action scenes. It is realistic, which translates into scenes some might consider boring, although I personally found them interesting as we worked with Ree to unravel a simple mystery, one which everyone seems to know the answer, but no one is telling.<br /><br />There is no sex or nudity, but it does show people with a meth spoon up their nose.</p></body></html>

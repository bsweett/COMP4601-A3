<meta name="summary" content="Evil Under the Umbrella"></head><body><p>I remember back in 2002 when Resident Evil came out how skeptical I was about a video game transfer to the big screen. But you gotta hand it to Writer/Director Paul Anderson on that one; he made a great, Action- Horror film.<br /><br />Then along came Resident Evil: Apocalypse (RE2) in 2004. Anderson wrote the script, but turned the directing reins over to noob Alexander Witt...and you see Witt's inexperience all over the movie. RE2 added an amateurish hokeyness that wasn't present in the original.<br /><br />In 2007 the series returns to straight-up Action - Horror with Resident Evil: Extinction (RE3). RE3 is not as dark and creepy as RE1, but it's a lot better than RE2. Anderson again wrote the script, but relied on vet Russ Mulcahy (remember the cult 80s hit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005RYL2">Highlander</a>?) to direct. For RE3, Mulcahy went back to a lot of the basics that made the original so good.<br /><br />RE1 and RE3 have good old fashion scares, tons of action and stories that never get boring. RE2 was entertaining and had its own share of action, but the story and the 'horror' lacked compared to 1 & 3.<br /><br />The story is pretty consistent throughout all three movies. The deadly T-Virus is accidentally (or not) released by the Umbrella Corporation, and it's up to Milla Jovovich to save the world from its effects: zombies, unthinkable mutations (man and animal alike) and the psychotic minds of the Umbrella Corp.<br /><br />It's certainly not necessary to watch all three to understand what's going on in the individual releases. In fact, you don't even need to watch them chronologically. But if you're into the Action - Horror genre, and you haven't seen the first two, I recommend just starting from the beginning and enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

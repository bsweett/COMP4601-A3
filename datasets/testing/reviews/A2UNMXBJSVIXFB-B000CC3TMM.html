Frank Martin still looks cool in a suit, drives a really fast car, and kicks a lot of butt with his Cory Yuen-choreographed martial arts. But what gets more of a giggle from me in this one is the cheesy, over-the-top humor. On occasion they make references to the last movie with the Rules gimmick, Tarconi claiming to be "the cook," and the rest of Martin's other mannerisms/quirks. It sort of reminds of Shoot 'Em Up, only without the hard R-rated violence and raunchiness. With that said, I actually like the film a lot more than I used to. Having seen it 4 times now at the moment of this writing, the movie seems to have grown on me after deciding to keep the franchise in the B-movie category. It's somewhat serious, yet obviously silly, but still manages to keep me entertained for some reason. In particular, I really like the Chellini character. Alessandro Gassman reminds me a lot of Benicio Del Toro, and I think he does a really good job being a sly, Colombian, crooked-teeth antithesis to Statham. The film itself is really short, which makes a lot of the action progress very smoothly. I didn't care for the melodramatic reunion between the mom and her son, as it feels a bit awkward and dampening to the pace, and I think they used a little too much CG for some of the more implausible action sequences. But other than that, I still think the movie is entertaining enough for 80-ish minutes and serves as a nice action/thriller escapist fantasy to stimulate the imagination. Props also to the cinematography and some very nice camera angles for all the Kung-fu and stunt work.<br /><br />Video - 4.0<br /><br />Although using the same antiquated MPEG-2 encode, Transporter 2 looks very good compared to its predecessor. Colors are vibrant, maybe even a tad bit over-saturated in the flesh tones department, but worthy of mention despite the setback. Sharpness and textures are also much-improved revealing a great amount of detail in overall picture quality and giving the fore/background a lot of depth and dimensionality. Black levels are excellent and do a good job in delineation between shadows and clothing for the most part. Contrast never feels too bright or too low and serves the sleek photography well. As skeptical as I am of BDs that still use MPEG-2, this is actually very presentable and I'm glad it at least looks this good. Given that it's Fox and that the fan base of the Transporter franchise probably won't warrant a remaster in a more advanced codec anytime soon, this is probably as good as the movie will ever look outside of an import (so send me a message if you find a better encode for the first two movies).<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Thankfully, lossless audio is the same any way you present it, regardless of old or new video encodes. The DTS-HD 5.1 track for this film is reference-quality. Specifically, I love the way it zones out any kind of background noise/music and focuses solely on the hits, whacks, and crunches in the scene where Statham is fighting the goons and henchmen. The clanking of metal, the crack of the fire hose, the thud of bodies being smacked around and falling to the floor; it's a pretty exhilarating experience that fits the sound design admirably. And that's not even including how great the car chase and gunfire effects are. High and low ends are reproduced perfectly from the suppressed Glock 18Cs to the revving of the Audi A8L W12. Dialogue is clear through the center, while directionality and separation are handled aptly within the front and rear sides. Music is immersive, but never overpowering, and LFEs have a nice subtlety to them when they're around. Despite the cheese and suspension of disbelief required for this movie, don't be afraid to showcase this audio treat.<br /><br />Extras - 0.5<br /><br />Sadly, there's nothing but trailers.<br /><br />Overall - 3.5<br /><br />The movie is ridiculous in terms of highly-exaggerated action sequences and a very simplistic "narrative." But if you liked the first Transporter and don't mind a little more cheese on top of your cheese, then this movie just might manage to entertain you for about an hour and a half. The video's not quite as good as it could be, but the audio is fantastic. There aren't any extra features either, not that it would really benefit, though I am a sucker for good making-ofs. With the current SRP being cheaper than most DVDs, why not take a seat, buckle up, and give it a spin?</p></body></html>

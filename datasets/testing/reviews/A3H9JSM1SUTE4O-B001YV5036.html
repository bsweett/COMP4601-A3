<meta name="summary" content="TERRIFIC FEEL GOOD MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE TRUE STORY"></head><body><p>There's been a lot of hand-wringing analysis about why Ron Howard's terrific true-life drama CINDERELLA MAN (Universal, $30) failed to catch fire at the box office, even with rave reviews.  Was it the title?  The time of release?  The poster?  Or perhaps audiences felt sucker-punched by Clint Eastwood's unhappy-ending boxing melodrama Million Dollar Baby.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, this gripping account of depression era, washed-up, ex-prizefighter James J. Braddock's triumphant comeback deserves DVD discovery.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is outstanding as Braddock, an honorable but ordinary "everyman" who became a symbol of a beaten-up populace.  Against all odds, the determined Braddock risked all in a literal fight to save his family that culminates in the 15 round 1935 slugfest with Max Baer, a giant of a heavyweight champ who had killed two men in previous fights.<br /><br />This is great filmmaking by a director at the peak of his powers.  Wonderful period detail enhances the emotion in every frame of this inspiring story. Crowe not only looks and sounds like Braddock, he masterfully recreates his boxing style.<br /><br />It's strange how some actual lives hit all the beats that are the essentials of timeless, fictional stories.  Braddock's story would be unbelievable if it weren't all-true.<br /><br />Extras include: The original Braddock/Baer fight, deleted scenes, a portrait of Braddock by family and friends and an enthusiastic commentary (one of three) by Howard.</p></body></html>

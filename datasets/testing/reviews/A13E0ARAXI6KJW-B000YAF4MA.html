<meta name="summary" content="Anticipating Mortality in a Pile of Clich&eacute;s Driven by a Couple of Predictable Star Turns"></head><body><p>Film master Akira Kurosawa made one of his most quietly powerful films in 1952's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLMU">Ikiru</a> about a government paper-pusher who learns he has six months to live and takes stock of all the things he has not done with his life. By comparison, Rob Reiner's output as a director has been less than stellar for well over a decade (consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D8L1K">Alex & Emma</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMGICS">Rumor Has It...</a>). This time, he appears to be going for a partial remake of "Ikiru" times two with this lugubrious, feel-good 2007 dramedy with components of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000055ZF6">Terms of Endearment</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731517">Grumpy Old Men</a> thrown in for good measure. The chief problem is that Justin Zackham's debut big-screen screenplay is predicated on so many live-before-dying clich&eacute;s that the entire venture doesn't feel honest despite the star presence of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Zackham's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach is much too manipulative to be affecting, and the roles he provides the two veteran actors don't allow them to leverage their talents to build believable characters. Can you tell I didn't like the movie much?<br /><br />The plot concerns itself with pompous health-care billionaire Edward Cole, who finds himself in his own hospital sharing a room with trivia-obsessed mechanic Carter Chambers. Ironically, Edward is the one who insists upon two patients to each room to cut overhead costs. Both are terminal cases there to receive cancer treatments with little if any chance of survival. Unsurprisingly, they enact their own version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000507P8">The Odd Couple</a> until they bond over a list Carter is compiling of little things he wants to do before he does. Edward naturally has more grandiose ideas of what his "bucket list" would be, and off they go on a series of predictably drawn adventures like skydiving, race-car driving and traveling to exotic places around the world. I find the travel sequences particularly amusing since it's obvious the actors were edited into travelogue footage. Deep-seeded regrets come to the surface on their journey - Edward's estrangement from his daughter and Carter's look back on an academic life unfulfilled and a marriage that has grown stale. There's no point in describing anything further since the whole point of the film is dealing with the inevitable.<br /><br />As Edward, Nicholson comes across as oddly schizophrenic. The actor's typically excessive moments are followed by surprisingly understated ones, and as a whole, his performance never connects the dots. Freeman fares marginally better as Carter, but his work here feels more like retread. Again, he provides the stoic voiceover and wizened wisdom he has been providing since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J4ZWS">The Shawshank Redemption</a>. And why cast an actor as exuberantly animated as Sean Hayes (the indefatigable Jack on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009Y3RW">Will & Grace</a> for eight seasons) in such an impassive role as Edward's officious factotum Thomas? He is so uncharacteristically restrained and non-committal in the role that the coda has little emotional impact. Relegated even further to the sidelines are Beverly Todd as Carter's wife, Rob Morrow as Edward's doctor, and in a silly bit part, Rowena King as a chic woman drawn to Carter in a bar. I'm not surprised that the 2008 DVD is bereft of significant extras - no commentary track, no making-of featurette,  just a five-minute short, "Writing a Bucket List" with Zackham explaining the genesis of the movie's concept, plus a disposable John Mayer video for the closing credits song, "Say", which is, by the way, a typical John Meyer song. I suggest renting "Ikiru" instead.</p></body></html>

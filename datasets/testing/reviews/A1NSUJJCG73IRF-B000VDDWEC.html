(2002)"></head><body><p>Director:  Danny Boyle<br /><br />Cast:  Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson, Megan Burns, Christopher Eccleston.<br /><br />Running Time:  113 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for extreme violence and gore, language, and brief nudity.<br /><br />Director Danny Boyle, who created fine pictures such as "Trainspotting" and "Shallow Grave", is back to redeem himself, as is screenwriter Alex Garland (Boyle directed and Garland wrote the wretched Leonardo DiCaprio disaster "The Beach") with "28 Days Later...," an interesting twist on the apocalyptic film.  Much like "The Lord of the Flies", the film strips away the civility we all think we possess and demonstrates that we, too, are bound by the laws of the animal kingdom - it's survival of the fittest and to have a future we need to reproduce.<br /><br />Twenty-eight days after being hit by a car, Jim (Cillian Murphy), a bike courier and the film's protagonist, wakes up to find London deserted. Making his way though the desolate surroundings of the city, he discovers that an awful virus is spreading through the streets and cities of Great Britain. Soon nearly everybody is affected by this deadly disease that turns its victims into zombies, who are quite noticeable and different from normal people due to their odd, rapid body movements, their blood red eyes, foaming at the mouth, and their inability to communicate with normal people unless they are trying to bite them. Jim stumbles along a small group of survivors: an intense, badass female (Naomie Harris) with the heart of a lion and a soul of steel, a gentle father (played extremely well by Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter (Megan Burns).  The group manages to stay alive and uninfected, but not for long. Eventually, they one-by-one fall victim to the awful disease and the remaining survivors have sealed a pact that involves them instantly killing any member of their group that has become infected, not to endanger those who are still alive and not yet zombies. As the survivors count their time left, they attempt to make it to a British military base near Manchester where they believe they will be safe.<br /><br />The first half of "28 Days Later..." is intensely engrossing, disgusting, and piteously terrifying; however, the film takes a detour for the worst when the clan of survivors finds its way to the military base in which the soldiers have the ammunition to keep everyone safe and the potential to learn more about the deadly virus.  Led by their captain (Christopher Eccleston), the soldiers soon decide that resisting the crazed, infected humans is secondary to other means of survival.  The film deviates from the terror of the infection into a heroic farce in which Jim must save the females of the group from the groping military soldiers who seem thirstier for intercourse than the zombie-like monsters are for blood.  The slick direction from Boyle is extremely unique and the musical score composed by John Murphy is unusual, yet eerily exceptional for a horror film.  What could have been one of the most distinctive and intellectual horror films of the decade loses unfortunately loses its sight.  An original, amusing gore fest nonetheless.</p></body></html>

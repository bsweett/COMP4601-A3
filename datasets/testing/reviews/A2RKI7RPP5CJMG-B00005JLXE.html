It truly was a surprise to me when I first learned that a film was actually going to be made about him.  He teamed up with Lou Ferrigno's "Hulk" when that TV series was used to crank out a few TV movies, but that particular flick was wretched.  It did no justice to the "Daredevil" character.<br />This "Daredevil," however, stays fairly true to the comic book, although I felt the story dragged somewhat.  The worst part of the movie was when Murdock and Elektra first meet.  The scenes with the two of them "play-fighting" came across as too rehearsed and just downright sugary.  Too sugary for a complex hero like "Daredevil."  Other than that, the movie is very good.  Comic faithfuls and general movie-goers alike will not be let down by this film.  It contains enough action and humor for anyone, and seems to flow in the same vein as Michael Keaton's portrayal of "Batman" in the first of that series of movies.<br />The film is very dark, and very violent, which stays true to form when compared with the comic book, especially during the Frank Miller era.<br />Whenever I watch "Spiderman," I get this happy feeling from when I was a child still growing up.  It takes me back to a time when superheroes were clean cut, patriotic, and all-around good guys.  When I view "Daredevil,"  it takes me to my teen years when I thought the world was against me and no one was ever going to help me through.  At that time, superheroes were no longer the good guys, they had become as complex as normal human beings and fought with themselves more than against an enemy.  This type of hero is closer to the real deal, he has problems, both physical and emotional, and there are no defined enemies anywhere.<br />One other small note, if you have young children, I don't suggest letting them watch this film.  "Daredevil" was geared more toward adults in the comics and so is this film.</p></body></html>

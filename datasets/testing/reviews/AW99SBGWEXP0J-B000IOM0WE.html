<meta name="summary" content="Aeon Flux"></head><body><p>400 years from now, 99% of the world's population has been wiped out by a virus.  Those remaining are living in a walled city and led by the Goodchild regime.  Five million people survived the plague in 2001, and five million still live in 2415.  The Goodchild regime is a totalitarian government, and the Monicans are focused on removing him from power by any means necessary.  The most dangerous Monican, Aeon Flux (Theron) accepts a specific mission from the Handler (McDormand) to kill Trevor Goodchild (Csokas).  With the help of her sidekick, Sithandra (Okonedo), she ventures into his fortress.  When the time comes to pull the trigger, something happens that will change their world forever.<br /><br />"Aeon Flux" is the film version of some short cartoons aired on MTV in the 1990's, and is a mixed bag, sometimes working and sometimes not -- mostly not.  There are a lot of nods to the cartoon, and they seem kind of silly when not in cartoon form.  Theron is wrong for the role, and never really feels right to this fan of the cartoon.  The story is moderately interested, but poorly executed for the most part.  "Aeon Flux" was a disappointment for me, and I can't help but think that with a different cast and crew, a better job could have been done.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Road of Eli"></head><body><p>First Impressions:<br /><br />Initially, you may be tempted to group the movie: The Road with this movie. In the Road, they are heading south, just to get warm, while in this movie, Eli (Denzil Washington) is heading West, to deliver his book. While both are post-apocalyptic films, The Book of Eli is much more well defined, and the objective is clear and attainable. Also, the feeling of despair is not heavily relied upon in the Book of Eli.<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />30 years ago, just after the last big war, Eli commenced his journey west to safely deliver his book. He survives by killing small animals and bartering things that he salvages. Eli has a very calm, unassuming disposition, but is extremely capable when it comes to defending himself. Every night, he quietly reads his book and prays.<br /><br />Cinematics:<br /><br />This film captures quite well the vastness and the emptiness of the land. You get the feeling that the land is now mainly desolate, apart from a few pockets where the survivors now inhabit.<br /><br />The tempo in this film changes rapidly, one moment there is calm and the next its calamity. The fight sequences are as pretty fast. Eli delivers strong measured responses depending upon the threat. The presentation is seamless and it is a very enjoyable action film.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable action film. While, Eli is a very good fighter, he is still only one man, and not invincible. This aspect is also well captured. Thanks to Solara (Mila Kunis) he is able to continue his journey. Watching this show is quite fulfilling, there are some very nice surprises at the end!</p></body></html>

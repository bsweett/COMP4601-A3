<meta name="summary" content="GOOD BUT NOT GREAT"></head><body><p>Similar to SPEED but not quite as good.  Tale focuses on a train that gets out of control and starts to pick up speed, creating danger for the community.  Washington and Pine do good to very good jobs with their characters but some of the supporting cast members are more memorable.  There's some good heart pumping action moments in this film.<br />Overall, I thought this would be a great film when it was only good.  It's hard to describe other than I didn't feel every scene overlapped properly, but, since this isn't film school I won't go into the details.  Overall, a good movie and better than most but not "A" quality.  I found the last few minutes to be cheesy. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; ACTION SCENES: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of March 2011; MY GRADE: B.</p></body></html>

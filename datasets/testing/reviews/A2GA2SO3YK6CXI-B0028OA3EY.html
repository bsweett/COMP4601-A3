But, you've got to love having Kevin Spacey in this movie. His performance is excellent. The first time we saw this movie, we went to IMAX to see it. Amazing! Some of the scenes actually make you feel as though you were flying. In Superman Returns we find Superman leaving Earth to find Krypton after astronomers have supposedly found it. When he returns to Earth, Lois Lane is engaged. And, of course, Lex Luthor is creating all sorts of challenges. Kevin Spacey as Luthor, is planning to destroy California but Superman stops him. Luthor realizes that by using the crystals from Krypton he can build a new continent... and he will hold the deed to the Real Estate. Billions might perish, but as always... Superman saves the day! Would sincerely recommend owning this DVD if you want to add a classic story to your collection.</p></body></html>

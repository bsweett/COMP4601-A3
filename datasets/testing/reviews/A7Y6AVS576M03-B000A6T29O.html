Arrogance runs so rampant across the screen that you can't tell the good guys from the bad in this movie. I remember when heroes had a little humility. That's what gave them staying power. Look at the likeable Indiana Jones that Harrison Ford created. Even look at the characters in the MUMMY. In that film even the villain had his moment of pathos and he even got to come back in the sequel! I'll tell you, that mummy was no dummy. Lara, you are out of your league. It was great to see Richard Johnson on the big screen once again on this film's theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Thanks Richard.</p></body></html>

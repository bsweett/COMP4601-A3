While the movie is not terrible, there is absolutely nothing memorable about it.  I just watched it last night and am having a hard time recalling the plot.  Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a man condemned to Hell for trying to kill himself and trying to attain redemption by banishing demons back to the underworld.  I like Keanu, but most of the time he reminds me of Neo, his character in the Matrix trilogy.  And in the Matrix movies, he reminded me of his character Ted in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.  The rest of the cast, including Rachel Weisz, was fine, the special effects were good, and there were even a few funny moments.  I was never too bored while watching it, but in the end it left me feeling empty.  The HD DVD transfer is one of the better ones, but this movie is a rental at best.</p></body></html>

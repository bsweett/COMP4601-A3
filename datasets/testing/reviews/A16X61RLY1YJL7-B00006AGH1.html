I truly understand the need to slightly change the events in a novel to make a movie, but this was only a glimmer of the novel at best.  Ben Affleck being a good actor, he's still no Jack Ryan.  This also pretty much rewrites Debt of Honor and Executive Orders down the road if they're to be made into movies as well.  As stated above, a good movie, but definitely &quot;Sum of All Fear's&quot; in name only, not in substance.</p></body></html>

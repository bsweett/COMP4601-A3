<meta name="summary" content="Confusing, emotionless, and action packed..."></head><body><p>The Amazon.com review calls this a movie about  "a female James Bond for the cyberpunk era."<br /><br />I've seen more humanity expressed in the the robots/cyborgs from Lost in Space, The Hitchhiker's Guide, and Bladerunner.  In Aeon Flux, the emotive level reaches, say, the level of I, Robot, starring Will Smith.<br /><br />In other words, a turnip.<br /><br />Okay, I can appreciate the energy in the stunts, which really is the central part of this movie.  The story, in theory, is interesting ("400 years in the future, after a virus decimates the world population, only one city on Earth remains").  In "reality," with one walled city, where does all of the food come from?  The concrete?  The energy?  The steel?  Technology is a bit more more complex than just putting up a wall and having everything you need.<br /><br />The twists in the plot are such that I really had to watch it again a few days later.  Who knew who and how?  What has been happening for 400 years?  How come the secret is known to such a select few?  Why doesn't the populace question the killings and disappearances?<br /><br />This is a movie to watch for the action.  You won't find any Tomb Raider dialogue here, or James Bond dalliances.<br /><br />With that proviso, enjoy.</p></body></html>

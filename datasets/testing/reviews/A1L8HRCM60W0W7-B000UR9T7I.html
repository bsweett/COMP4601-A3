<meta name="summary" content="IT DAZZLES. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS."></head><body><p>There will always be naysayers to a franchise such as Spiderman's. It's a mega blockbuster and come time for a sequel, expectations run amok. But I am happy to report that the third outing of this arachnid adventure is just what you would want it to be: very decent popcorn, amid some gulpy, wide-eyed sips of Coke.<br /><br />Nothing more, nothing less. Don't read too much if you haven't seen the film, it is best enjoyed with minimum hopes. The visual FX are a labor of love and grandeur, despite the running lament of CGI geeks. I had little idea prior to the movie that one of the villains would meet his biological alchemy. Very well composed (and decomposed).<br /><br />In trying to better what he has accomplished before, the director may have gone over-board by tripling the number of characters and by going for a much too bombastic face-off in the climax, which only amount to the exact opposite: a diminishing effect. But that is offset by the rewards of continuity from previous 'episodes'. There's a heady dollop of good-natured humor, friendship, betrayal, jealousy, love, morality, even some funky moves on the dance floor! Which is fun as it goes a bit beyond senseless derring-do.<br /><br />In the end, Spidey III is a refreshing departure from cardboard caricatures of good and evil. Bad guys are not always dripping in venom (they have a reason to do what they do, sometimes even rooted in affection), nor the good guys in saccharine. Tobey Maguire is effortless as the gentle, goofy Peter Parker, but we see an extra sliver of his acting range as he stretches his character--and his Spandex--when he is overcome by a dark, sinister thingie. Gives a whole new meaning to the expression "getting one's tights in knots".<br /><br />A word for Topher Grace. I am thoroughly impressed by how far he has come from That Seventies Show, to capers such as 'P.S.' and In Good Company, to a sharp, screen-dominating cameo in a Level A blockbuster. And he is equal to the task. His gamble with being the baddest of the bad guys, whose vindictive gene gets the better of him at last, is administered with such flair that one is guilty of hoping he would come around in the end. Does he? I'll leave that for you to find out. While he is at it, he sure is punchy.<br /><br />This is no classy noir but it is spectacular. And while it is studded with perhaps more characters than it may have time to fully develop, it does do its job, and does so with flying colors. Literally.</p></body></html>

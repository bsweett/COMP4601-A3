Leone was a genius in the sense that he did not so much evoke the West but he reimagined it with a European's sensibility.  In doing so he placed himself on the same pedestal as his idols John Ford and Howard Hawks.  His storytelling here is great.  The acting, with the possible exception of star Clint Eastwood, who legend has it was growing tired of "spaghetti westerns" and wanted to return Stateside, is stellar.  Lee Van Cleef is memorably cold-hearted and evil as Angel-Eyes.  The real star is Eli Wallach as Tucco.  Though the film designates him as "the Ugly", Tucco is the character we can most relate to.  Yes, he's done many bad things.  There are two scenes here that elicit empathy for Tucco.  One, where Tucco attempts to embrace his brother, a priest, and is subsequently rebuffed.  The other, where he is frantically racing through the endless cemetery for the buried gold.  It does not so much elicit sympathy for him, but you can feel the pathos.  Recently, a commercial TV station was showing "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" in a two hour time slot.  They cut the cemetery scene out completely.  That's like showing "Citizen Kane" without revealing what Rosebud is.  Needless to say, Ennio Morricone delivers another classic score here.  I didn't find critic Richard Schickel's commentary on the DVD as being very informative;more like tedious.  The deleted scenes didn't add much to the film's narrative.  Nor were the documentaries much to write home about.  The theatre cards included in the package were pretty cool though.</p></body></html>

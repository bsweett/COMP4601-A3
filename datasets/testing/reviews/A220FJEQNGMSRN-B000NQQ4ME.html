<meta name="summary" content="The Naked Prey meets Kings of the Sun on Rapa Nui"></head><body><p>Mad Mel's Apocalypto turns out not to be quite the splatter movie it was painted by feint-hearted critics still reeling from all the welts in The Passion. Instead it's The Naked Prey revisited with slight hints of Kings of the Sun and even Rapa Nui, though rather than telling his story from the perspective of the Mayans he chooses to play down the spectacle and see it through the eyes of their intended sacrificial victims. The story is surprisingly slight - peaceful tribe get captured as human sacrifices for Mayan priests to appease their gods, only for one to make a run for freedom and the trapped wife and child he left behind - but he manages to instil it with more substance than you might expect without hitting you over the head with it. There's an ecological message about impending disaster, but unlike any of those touchy-feely New Age types, there's no imaginary native wisdom on display here: the Mayan civilisation may be an ancient one, but here it's every bit as stupid as its modern-day equivalents, blindly destroying itself and their environment, bringing plague and devastation as they destroy their depleting natural resources, distracting the people with a non-stop conveyer belt of bloody sacrifices. These are savage times, and the film's spectacular centrepiece in the Mayan city doesn't stint on the gore. Yet at the same time the characters are recognisable - they tell dirty stories, play practical jokes and B.S. each other as they get on with their lives. Even the raiding party are little different from a group of modern-day buddies on a fishing trip.<br /><br />With Gibson beginning his film with the same Will Durant quote that ended The Fall of the Roman Empire - `a great civilisation is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within' - it's clear that he's informed by Sixties epics as more than he is by Herzog's nutters in the jungle. Indeed, while he may eschew the Scope format he even shoots the Mayan city in the classic Anthony Mann style, discarding the big establishing shot but choosing instead to gradually reveal it as the characters are drawn into it, saving the big money shots for the end of the sequence. As a result, it's a much more convincing and layered depiction of its world and its many social levels than you'd expect for something other directors might have thrown away as a simple background walk-through.<br /><br />Yet after the spectacle, the film scales itself down again as it goes back to basics, and while it's not exactly an anti-climax, it's this section that keeps the film from being more than just pretty good. The big chase lacks the imagination and power of The Naked Prey (which also has the advantage of a much tighter running time), keeping the film at the level of just another survival-of-the-smartest action adventure. It's not bad, but it doesn't hold many surprises, going through many of the traditional means of disposing of your enemies that the movies have been offering since Leslie Banks stalked The Most Dangerous Game back in 1932, though Gibson does throw in a great "There goes the neighbourhood" punchline. He's also blessed with a couple of striking villains in the Wes Studi-like form of Raoul Trujillo as the chief manhunter Zero Wolf and Gerardo Taracena as the cocky sadist of the team, Middle Eye.<br /><br />While it's certainly the best-looking digitally shot feature to date, there are still some problems - with digital's persistent problems with catching high-speed motion, it's not the best idea to shoot a chase movie in digital even if you do have a cinematographer as good as Dean Semler, and some shots are distractingly subpar even on a small screen.<br /><br />It's interesting but not entirely surprising that the not exactly overloaded with extras DVD (just a commentary, half-hour making of and 35-second deleted scene) doesn't include the film's trailer, since looking at it after seeing the film it's clearly not only made up of footage that doesn't even appear in the film - mainly makeup, wardrobe and camera test footage - but it even seems to include a different leading man and a very different look for its native characters and even the Mayan city.</p></body></html>

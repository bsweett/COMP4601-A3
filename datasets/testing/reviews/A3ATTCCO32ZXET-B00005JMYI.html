<meta name="summary" content="My pick for best comedy of 2004."></head><body><p>There's no way that a cast which includes some of the funniest comedic actors of the new century could fail.  That's not just Will Ferrell, but Christina Appelgate, Fred Willard  and Steve Corell from Comedy Central's Daily Show.  Separately, they've each made their own success in past roles but here in Anchorman they're a comic force ad libbing their way through a script that sets an already impressive foundation.  I nearly cracked in half a few times.<br /><br />The premise is, what was it like that historic day in the `70s when the first woman went in front of the camera, not as a cheesecake weather girl but as a serious reporter?  The all-male news team reacts with the predictable; attempts to sabotage her with innuendo and psychological warfare, seduction, immature jokes.  The sort of stuff that happens any time a woman "invades" a male-dominated field.  Only Veronica (the much-underrated Christina Applegate) handles it all with a bemused tolerance and class.  Nothing could bring her down, that is, until the impossible happened...she falls for Ron Burgundy.  Ron, the living stereotype of chauvinism and a Jr. High Schoolboy mentality, is lonely underneath all of his unqualified success as a tv news anchor.  Can love temper their differences and bridge the gap between the sexes?<br /><br />I think that what makes Anchorman work is an underlying glee at lampooning the self-important, phony airs put on by talking head all over the country.  In every well-modulated tone, every pretentious turn of phrase and every carefully choreographed inflection we can see the Channel Four News Team's hilarious, accurate mimicry. The entire cast has it down perfectly.  We instinctively recognize that it's a delicious send-up of the so-called journalists we are familiar with as a television audience.<br /><br />Then again, if you don't watch the news on television you probably won't get half of the in-jokes.  That would explain *some* people's reactions, but...<br /><br />A niggling thought occurs:  could it be that Anchorman's detractors were uncomfortably reminded of their own behavior at times?  Really and truly folks, the film's message about `70s sexism was delivered with lightheartedness, gently, and with no righteous fury whatsoever.  And yet, some people may take even the lightest poke as a full frontal assault.  A case of a guilty conscience making for a sensitive viewer, perhaps?<br /><br />In any case, I plead with you not to allow a few negative comments from other reviewers to keep you from seeing what I think may be the funniest film of 2004.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle.</p></body></html>

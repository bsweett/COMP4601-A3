Further viewings (including a recent one) have made me changed my mind and hang my head in shame.  This is one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and one of Eastwood's crowning achievements as a filmmaker and as an actor.<br /><br />The film is uncommonly dark, even for an Eastwood film.  It starts off with a brutal rape scene, and ends with a shootout.  The cinematography is masterful, arguably the best in any Eastwood film.  Eastwood's character, Billy, is really trying to go straight after spending a lifetime of killing, whoring, and maiming.  His wife is dead, his farm is failing, and he's worried about his children.  He gets a chance to get some money, but he has to find and kill the people who raped and beat up(and got away with it) a prostitute at the beginning of the film.  Over the course of the film, Eastwood's quest becomes more brutal and darker, concluding in what has to be the best, most brooding scene in all of Eastwood's work.  The final scene takes place in the bar/brothel where the rape/assault took place.  The scene starts in a wide shot, then you see Eastwood's rifle make an entrance, but it's only his rifle.  It's a brilliant entrance, one of the greatest in Western movie history, and the concluding shootout is as menancing and as cruel as the West could be.<br /><br />This film won Eastwood his first Oscar, and it's a film that deserved all its accolades.  Most Best Picture Oscar winners are rather safe and tame films, but this is one of the exceptions where an uncommonly dark film swept the awards.  It also rejuvinated Eastwood's career a bit.  He had just directed and starred in The Rookie, a film that is considered his worst film by mostly everyone, including fans (for the record, it's not that bad of a film.  Pink Cadillac is Clint's worst movie).  The Rookie was a box office and critical bomb.  So when this film appeared, it really brought Eastwood back, and he's been there ever since.  Unforgiven is considered one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and deservedly so.<br /><br />For the record, buy the 2 disc special edition DVD, not the single disc edition.  The single disc edition (which is thankfully out of print) is a very poor edition, with an unremarkable, grainy transfer, no special features, and a bizarre scene selection menu that is impossible to navigate.  The 2 disc edition has an excellent transfer of the film, several excellent documentaries, including one where we see Clint making his vastly underrated 1997 film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and an episode of Maverick with Clint in a supporting role.</p></body></html>

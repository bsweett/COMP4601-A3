This film has some of the best special effects I've ever seen. It makes The Perfect Storm look precisely like the little boat in a box of water that it was (not to mention paper-thin characters and way too much nonsensical machismo.) The plane crash in Cast Away is so real that the viewer gets a terrifying sense of its actuality. (The only other &quot;wreck&quot; sequence I've seen that was comparable was the train wreck in The Fugitive.)<p>I cannot conceive of any other actor pulling off what Hanks does in this film. He is an actor with such honesty and integrity that he inhabits every character he portrays. And in this case, one cannot help but watch in awe as he invests his formidable skills in this Fedex employee who miraculously survives not only a horrifying plane crash but also a life of total isolation on an unpopulated little island.<p>What's also amazing is that this film was directed by Robert Zemeckis who's not famous for his sensitivity. But this film has it all: utterly believable characters, a fine script, and more action than most bash-em-up, shoot-em-ups could ever manage on their best days. To see a man we come to care about deeply beat the odds and survive makes for the most rewarding viewing. There's not a single predictable moment, nor a single stock character to be found anywhere in this film.<p>Absolutely stunning and highly recommended.</p></body></html>

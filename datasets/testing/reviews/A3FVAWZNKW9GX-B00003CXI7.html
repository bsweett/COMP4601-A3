<meta name="summary" content="Harrison Ford Stars in Dog"></head><body><p>Whatever homage for Hitchcock was intended, "What Lies Beneath" is not fit to be on the same shelf as "Rear Window." Why? Hitchcock movies are intelligent, winding around the story and characters. "What Lies Beneath" uses spooky music and scenes that jump out and calls it disturbing.<br /><br />"Ghostbusters" is scarier.<br /><br />What is disturbing is Harrison Ford's choice to be involved. What was he thinking when he signed on? He's a favorite actor for me. He's starred in "Star Wars," "Indiana Jones," "The Fugitive" and "Mosquito Coast." Good stuff. Until this.<br /><br />Ford's credibility as an actor is not shaken. He carries each scene of this meandering movie. Bad plotlines are confused as tricky storytelling, and even Ford can't take a Saturday-matinee and turn it into a Friday-night blockbuster.<br /><br />Does the movie adequately refer to Hitchcock classics? Who cares? That sort of thing is only interesting when the referring movie succeeds on its own. This doesn't. That's the same problem Ang Lee had when making "The Hulk." He spent so much time of mimicking a style that he forgot to make a good movie.<br /><br />The Plot:<br />Happy couple lives in Vermont. The wife is being spooked but does not know why. The husband does not seem to understand. The ghost slowly reveals its intentions, and the happy couple's life unravels. The big finish is not expected, and the only redeeming part of this 130 minute couch-sit.<br /><br />About the story:<br />Connections are never made as to why the ghost waits a year to do some haunting, and why it took the measures involved. Nor, why it thinks Claire "knows" why she's being haunted when she fully demonstrates she has no idea.<br /><br />The ghost tries to kill Norman, Ford's character. If that's all it wants, why does it need Claire, Michelle Pfeiffer's character and Norman's wife?<br /><br />Subplots involving the quirky neighbors are never sorted out.<br /><br />"What Lies Beneath" as a title is misleading. I can't go into this more for the sake of ruining the story for those of you who will wind up still seeing it.<br /><br />In all, the movie will be forgotten, played late at night in the time slot reserved for exercise equipment commercials. The movie is not awful, and better than a rerun of that infomercial with Chuck Norris. It is just that Harrison Ford, and costar Michelle Pfeiffer can and have done better.<br /><br />Looking for a real thriller? See the Hitchcock movies that this is being compared. "Rear Window" with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly is a great place to begin.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></body></html>

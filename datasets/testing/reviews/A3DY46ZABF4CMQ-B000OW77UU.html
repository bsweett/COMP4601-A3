<meta name="summary" content="...an inspirational movie!"></head><body><p>The Pursuit of Happyness is the sad but uplifting true story of millionairre stockbroker Chris Gardner. Will Smith (Hitch) plays Gardner with such a sincerity that I will be rooting for him to win this year's Oscar for Best Actor when, not if, he is nominated.<br /><br />The movie pursues Gardner as he struggles with cash, which ends him up on the street with his son, played by Smith's real life son Jaden, who in my opinion deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance as well. After being evicted from his home for failing to pay the rent, Gardner goes from the subway restroom to homeless shelters, as his dream of becoming a stockbroker takes it's first but difficult steps as a non-paid intern at a major stock brokerage firm.<br /><br />Pursuit teaches us that we must follow our dreams no matter what might happen. It is truly an inspirational movie that should garner many Oscar nominations including one for Best Picture, and one for Best Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton who plays Gardner's impatient wife, as well as an award nomination and win for both Smith and son!<br /><br />One of the best films of 2006.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A</p></body></html>

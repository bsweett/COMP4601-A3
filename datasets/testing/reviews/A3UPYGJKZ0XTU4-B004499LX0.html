"Closer" is the latest addition to this select group of utter cinematic failures. It's based on a Broadway play written by Patrick Marber, who also wrote the screenplay. And the writing is atrocious. This is a "relationship movie". It's about two couples: Alice and Dan, Anna and Larry. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a young American in London. She and Dan (Jude Law) meet when Alice looks the wrong way when crossing a street and is hit by a car. After he has been with Alice for a year, Dan meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a portrait photographer who is also American. Anna rejects him. So Dan poses as Anna on an internet sex chat site and sets Anna up with Larry (Clive Owen), a sleazebag doctor, without her knowing it. But Anna and Larry hit it off and become a couple. A year later, Dan is still with Alice but preoccupied with Anna. So change your partners, dosey-doe. But that's not the end of it. Unfortunately.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed about "Closer" is that it's contrived to the point of being corny. The second thing I noticed is that I didn't know anyone's name. The characters have protracted conversations with strangers without introducing themselves. We get the first name 10 minutes into the film. By this point, it's a relief. I presume "Closer" is supposed to be about how and why people love one another, but it is a hypothetical exploration of that subject. Real people don't act or speak like these characters, and there is no indication of why the characters care for one another. In fact, they really don't seem to. The idea that any of the characters are in love is preposterous.<br /><br />The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. It feels like a play. A bad play. Characters constantly make nonsensical proclamations, like "I couldn't lie to you....because I love you." Every conversation is ponderous. The writing is so bad that sometimes one character has to articulate what another is feeling. Larry is a thoroughly obnoxious person who lives for conquest. Dan is a romantic. Both men are uncommonly self-absorbed. Anna is guilt-ridden. Alice is supposed to be an enigma, but she's just childlike. Anna and Larry both seem emotionally ill, so I have to agree with Larry that they belong together. All four of them have a pathological desire to know everything about their partners, which they spend most of their time pursuing. At one point Dan says, "Please tell me the truth....because I'm addicted to it." Yup. Their lives would be a lot easier if these people discovered the concept of discretion.<br /><br />I can't say "Closer" is all bad. It really depends upon your sense of humor. The dialogue is unintentionally funny from the start. If you last long enough, there is one interminable conversation between Larry and Alice in a strip club that is absolutely hilarious. You'll laugh out loud when Dan breaks down in tears. That's notable for being the nadir of Jude Law's career. Truthfully, Clive Owen's performance is good, but his character is nonsense. The other three performances are flat. They could scarcely be otherwise. So I don't recommend the film. But if you approach "Closer" with wry humor and lots of popcorn, you might find something in it.<br /><br />The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2005 release): There is a music video for "The Blower's Daughter", performed by Damien Rice, which is the song that plays over the closing credits.  Subtitles are available for the film in English and French. Dubbing is available in French.</p></body></html>

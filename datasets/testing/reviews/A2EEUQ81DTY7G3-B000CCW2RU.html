<meta name="summary" content=""Lately I've been having bad dreams""></head><body><p>While watching Michael Bay's sensory and action orientated overkill, The Island, I was struck by how derivative the film is. It's actually a direct rip off of the book Logan's Run and the 1976 film of the same name, which starred Michael York and Jenny Agutter, the similarities are too obvious to miss - we have a hermetically sealed, insular world, a hero who decides that he wants more and ends up questioning his environment, and a daring, tension filled escape. I'm just amazed that author, William F. Nolan hasn't screamed "lawsuit!"<br /><br />The Island is almost schizophrenic in tone and theme. The first half of the movie is a creepy, sparse, and chilling science fiction parable, while the second half is a high-octane storm of bullets, car chases, and multiple explosions. Both work well as separate movies, but perhaps don't sit particularly well as a whole. It seems as though Bay, burns up his ideas in the first hour and pads out the rest of the movie with joltingly repetitive and over the top action sequences which look as though they would be best suited to another film.<br /><br />It's the year 2019, and Lincoln Six Echo (a strangely bland Ewan McGregor) is one of several hundred survivors of a catastrophe that left the whole world contaminated, save one place - the illusive and sort-after Island. This lush retreat, Lincoln and the other refugees are promised, will one day be their home. For now, they're kept in a lavish but sterile research facility, where they are treated as "special" and their every whim catered too.<br /><br />But from the outset we know that all is not right, that these people are not what they seem. An aura of creepiness surrounds the facility as the authorities force the inhabitants to wear identifying wrist bracelets, carefully monitor their moods, diet and metabolism; and strictly forbid male-female "proximity." Suspicious by nature and prone to prophetic nightmares, Lincoln finds his worst fears confirmed after Starkweather (Michael Clarke Duncan), is selected by random lottery to go to the Island.<br /><br />When Lincoln's friend and burgeoning love interest, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), is the next one to win the lottery, Lincoln grabs her and together they stage a jailbreak. Alarmed by the breach, sinister mastermind Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) hires a mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) to hunt them down. The fugitives make their way to Los Angeles where they manage to elude their pursuers and survive one close call after another.<br /><br />While the narrative is pretty generic and there aren't that many surprises - viewers will learn pretty early on what the menacing doings of the research facility are, one is left to admire the slick, glossy and obviously expensive production design. The biotech facility, in particular, suggests a cross between a day spa, a spaceship, and a maximum-security prison, all sleek and gleaming with its inhabitants walking around in shiny white space suits.<br /><br />The most visually spectacular sections are when the couple land in Los Angeles, with the city's current skyline given a futuristic, dazzling feel. Los Angeles locals will get a kick out of seeing that in a future Los Angeles, all the traffic problems have been solved, with gleaming, fast sky rail trains traversing about the newly revitalized downtown streets. But even here, Bay's direction zips along at such an un-modulated rush, so eager to get on with the next set piece or expository line of dialogue, that we have precious little time to soak up all the startling images.<br /><br />The Island is one of those movies that come across as so studio manufactured and contrived, with product placements abounding and the usual vertiginous headache inducing camera movements. In terms of spectacle, the movie is a pileup of kinetic mayhem, as Lincoln and Jordan's first actions in the real world include dodging bullets, destroying several police cars, and crashing a hovercraft into a skyscraper. It all becomes rather silly and preposterous after awhile.<br /><br />McGregor and Johansson are talented, charismatic performers, but their characters are essentially blank slates and not very interesting. You could do a pretty good movie just about the learning curve of these people thrust into an unfamiliar environment, but this just isn't it. The film does introduce some thought-provoking issues about morality and the use of humans for malevolent ends, but this thought is ultimately the last thing on The Island's mind. It's more interested in bang, boom, and multiple car chases. Mike Leonard December 05.</p></body></html>

If his Fast Paced, Extraordinary abilities, and the intense Action of this film are not enough for you, wait until you see the "Bad Girl" of the film!<br /><br />The super hot, Bad Girl is enough to make me switch sides, but The Transporter sticks to his guns.  writing this makes me want to watch the film, again, so I can gander at the Bad Girl.  She makes Evil look Sexy.<br /><br />If <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VBTNM">The Transporter (Special Delivery Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BTITKS">Transporter 2</a> get you juiced up, and you want more....

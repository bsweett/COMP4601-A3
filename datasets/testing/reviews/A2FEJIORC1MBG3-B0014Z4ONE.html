<meta name="summary" content="Must we be force-fed the weak sequels??!!"></head><body><p>&quot;Raiders Of The Lost Ark&quot; is a  &quot; ***** &quot;  (five-star) film; a genuine adventure classic and required addition to every film buff's collection. The eyeball-rolling sequels, on the other hand, were strictly for the kiddies and the ubiquitous fast-food marketing tie-ins. For fans of the sequels (and obsessive completists), box sets are a nice option, I suppose, but the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; DVD trilogy now joins the available-as-box-set-only &quot;Godfather&quot; collection (and the upcoming &quot;Star Wars&quot; DVD extravaganza) as a cynical slap in the face to those of us who prefer the &quot;a-la-carte&quot; option (and a little money left over for,oh, you know- rent and food). Boo! Hiss! to corporate greed and this extremely irritating industry trend.</p></body></html>

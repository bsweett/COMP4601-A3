<meta name="summary" content="some good scares"></head><body><p>Recently we went to see I Am Legend.<br /><br />Based on a novel which I believe is of the same name, it tells the tale of a military doctor who is one of the few survivors of a plague, which has wiped out most of humanity, and turned most of the rest of the population into a pack of ravenous but daylight-fearing zombies. The doctor's manic mission is to find a cure for plague. He is on his own, except for his trusted dog, left behind by his family when they fled New York.<br /><br />The doctor is played by Will Smith, and he has to carry most of the movie on his own. And carry it he does. He could have been manic or over-the-top, but he kept things reserved, showing the quiet warping of personality associated with imposed isolation for years.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect. The zombies are too McGuffin-like, and the film feels a little shorter than it should have been as a result. Nevertheless, the movie was enjoyable, and provided some good scares too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Being Just Marvelous"></head><body><p>In the annuals of movie comedy history, there has never been anything quite like Being John Malkovich. I hope there never is again, not for negative reasons, but because it should float out there forever like some special little planet. Then, decades from now, people can look back and see a unique sample of where originality was at the end of the Twentieth Century. The following plot information should be enough to say whether or not it belongs in your universe. Obviously, it fits in fine in mine.<p>Craig Schwartz is a gifted and frustrated puppeteer. I think all puppeteers are frustrated, but manual dexterity is not a talent of mine. I don't hold a ball-point pen. I have to clutch it, or else I flip it across the room. Craig lives in New York with his wife Lotte [Cameron Diaz], who runs a pet shop. She has a bad habit of bringing injured or frustrated animals home. The house is a menagerie. We quickly see that both of these people are highly manipulative. When Lotte suggests that Craig find a normal job [just until his puppeteer career takes off, of course], he grudgingly starts looking for one. He spies an ad from The Lester Corp. that seeks a short person who can file quickly. When he arrives at the building listed, he looks at the directory, only to find that Lester is supposedly on floor 7 1/2. Indeed, it really is. The floor is two-thirds the height of a normal one. Propelled by curiosity and a sense of the ridiculous, Craig goes ahead and gets the job.<p>Working at Lester Corp. is a challenge that goes far beyond having to walk around all day stooped over. The Executive Secretary literally does not hear what anyone says to her. She isn't deaf. It's worse than that. Everything said to her is translated into something else. She's straight out of Alice in Wonderland. Dr. Lester [Orson Beane] thinks about nothing else but chasing women. He's 105 years old. And as for coworker Maxine [Catherine Keener], she is nothing short of insane - not homicidal, but simply mad as a hatter. Yet for a puppeteer, who dreams of performing at Lincoln Center, and for his wife, who lives in her own furry critter world, the situation is not that far removed from their own reality. <p>One afternoon Craig accidentally knocks some papers off a file cabinet. He has to move the cabinet to retrieve them and discovers a little door. He opens it and finds a cave-like passage, just big enough for him to crawl into, which, like any sane man, he promptly does. Suddenly, the door slams shut behind him, and a sudden great wind propels him down a long tunnel. He finds himself peering at the world through someone else's eyes. That someone looks in a mirror, and Craig realizes he is inside the real John Malkovich's head. He is fascinated by this phenomenon, but soon enough he goes flying out and crashes onto the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. <p>There is much more to the story, but this is more than enough to tell you if you find it very original or unimaginably stupid. If the story is to your taste, there is more good news. First-time director Spike Jonze, who made a name for himself doing music videos and commercials, is an astounding talent. He has learned a lot in his twenty-nine years. I don't know if he cast the movie, but the choices are shrewd because Cusack, Diaz, Keener and Mary Kay Place all have played in a number of original, off the wall or screwball comedies. Here are a few of the titles: The Player [1992], Grosse Pointe Blank ['97], My Best Friend ['98], There's Something About Mary ['98] and Pecker ['98]. I recommend all of these. These actors are obviously at home in this kind of movie. As a film buff, the icing of the cake is John Malkovich. This is the first film comedy of his long career, but here he is, not only surviving in style in this madhouse, but also playing himself.</p></body></html>

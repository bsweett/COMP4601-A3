<meta name="summary" content="Coen's Have Jumped the Shark, Awful!"></head><body><p>I really think that without Big Studio guidance, or even the old Hays Office, Hollywood filmmaking has deteriorated badly. I'm all for freedom, but films are collaborative affairs with huge budgets and when the artiste runs the show, we get disaster after disaster. Now the Coen's have jumped the shark.<br /><br />Look, I liked the Josh Brolin character, gritty, poor, but resourceful when he finds the money in the midst of a bad drug deal. But just because you're in old Indian country on the Mexican border, it doesn't mean that there's no human compassion out there. All the existential, it don't matter anymore crap, the cheap killing and philosophizing before execution, all of that has no artistic merit unless someone believes in something. I don't care if it's God or Marx, we can't relate unless it touches our heart.<br /><br />Finally, okay, A Fist Full of Dollars kind of adventure, gritty and the good-guy shoots the bad guys, you won't get that here. The good-guys just retire and mumble something about the good old days when dudes get shot on a porch or something. Awful!</p></body></html>

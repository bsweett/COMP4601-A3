<meta name="summary" content="Dr. Strangelove meets Angelina Bourne"></head><body><p>(Unrated version) WARNING: This review may contain unintentional plot spoilers. The movie had me hooked about 20 minutes into it. Angelina Jolie spends 2 years in a N.Korean prison out of the reach of Jimmy Carter. She is released in a spy swap. She works for a dummy CIA company in New York which doesn't have a metal detector sophisticated enough to detect knife blades inside of shoes. After Jolie is back in NYC, a Russian defector comes in from the cold and tells us, and the CIA, the plot of the movie. He claims Angelina (Salt) is really a Russian mole, planted here as a child and she is going to kill the Russian president. Salt denies this, and runs away before she could clear herself in order to save her husband. There are numerous minor flashbacks during the movie to fill in plot points. They also make the predictable "twists" predictable enough for dummies.<br /><br />The film makes fun of the real Angelina who can't cook, but can do everything else. She can make a better cannon than William Shatner out of household items. Bobby Clark (Gorn)in a rubber mask would not have stood a chance. She can scale a building in her bare feet and split skirt better than Spider Man (or Spider Babe for Misty Mundae fans). Salt can also jump from the top of truck to truck, better than Tom Cruise and that is after taking a bullet to the hip, which doesn't even give her a limp. Jolie can ride a motorcycle as well as Evel Knievel and can beat up men quicker than Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. I am not sure why the NYPD handcuffed people with their hands in the front. I guess the "behind the back" cuff would have made the escape too unbelievable. And Bruce Willis could have taken notes on how to climb down an elevator shaft from Salt.<br /><br />And during the whole time, her makeup never ran or hair came out of place. Okay, we'll forgive you about not being able to cook.</p></body></html>

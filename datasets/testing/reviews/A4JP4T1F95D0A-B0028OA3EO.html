<meta name="summary" content="Nice Returns"></head><body><p>This is a really well crafted movie by a director who obviously loves the character.  The problem with this movie is that it is basically a reintroduction to the character of superman.  There hasn't been a new superman film in quite a while, and not a good superman film since part 2 over 20 years ago.  This film throws out part 3 and 4 and takes place 5 years after part 2.  Superman has returned from a long space journey to find the remains of his destroyed planet of Krypton.  When he returns he finds a lot of things differant, and earth has moved on without him.  The film then examines whether the world needs Superman.  You also have the return of Lex Luther who was released from jail on a technicality.  For new fans, this is a great movie that gives you superman's origin, a bunch of back story and adds a lot of modern sensibilities.  For comics fans, or even fans of the original movies, there isn't much new.  Wonderful upgrades in special effects make this much prettier than the first Superman movie, but another fight with Luther and Kryptonite didn't really excite me.  I would have loved to see him duke it out with the countless super powered villains he has faced in comics.  Still this is a nice return, and I hope they make more films so that they can explore the characters more.</p></body></html>

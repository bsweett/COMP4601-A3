<meta name="summary" content="Hey, somebody has to sell arms to the wackos of the world"></head><body><p>"Lord of War" begins by following a bullet from the moment it is manufactured to the point at which it is fired and kills somebody on the other side of the globe.  I think it is obvious that is what is going to be the payoff to the opening sequence, but I also think that you know the victim is going to be instantly recognizable as an innocent, because clearly selling arms is a bad thing.  But the point of this 2005 movie from writer-director Andrew Niccol is that selling arms is also big business.  How big he saves for the final punch line of the film, which makes sure nobody finishes watching "Lord of War" without getting the point.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a Ukrainian immigrant who discovers that his gift in this world is selling arms (a.k.a. "gun running").  He teams up with his brother, Vitaly (Jared Leto), until they are paid off one time with cocaine and a kilo is appropriated for personal use.  Pursuing Yuri is Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an American agent working with INTERPOL, whose Achilles heel is that he will not break the law, although you have to admire his interpretation of holding a suspect in custody for 24 hours before charging them.  Yuri always knows exactly where he stand vis-a-vis the law, but I must saw that he is perfectly polite when yanking Valentine's chain.  Yuri's own Achilles heel would be his wife, the former Ava Fontaine (Bridget Monyahan), a super model that he is able to wine and dine into becoming his wife.  She remains oblivious to what he does, but if Yuri has to choose between his wife and his work, you are inclined to think he would go with the latter.  After all, the fall of the Soviet Union and the arms bonanza that creates in the former republics is a lot more important to Yuri than the fact his son has started walking.<br /><br />However, there are two people who seem to pose a bigger threat to Yuri.  One is Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm), the king of the arms dealers, who sells not for the money but to dictate the balance of power in the world by picking sides.  Yuri refuses to pick sides.  Yuri maintains he is oblivious to what the guns, grenades, tanks and other military hardware are ultimately used for by the people who buy them (the same cannot be said for Vitaly).  Weisz wants to squash Yuri, but whether it is for economic or ideological reasons is not clear.  The other threat is one of Yuri's biggest customers, Andre Baptiste Sr. (Eamonn Walker), the dictator of Liberia, who is crazy enough that he might blow Yuri away on a whim with a gun that has not been sold yet (or by sending him a couple of local women from a country that has one of the highest AIDS rates in the world).  Since the film focuses so much on Yuri's ride, you know that there is going to have to be a fall.  The question is, how far and how hard?<br /><br />Niccol wrote and directed "S1mOne" and "Gattaca," and also wrote "The Terminal" and "The Truman Show," so clearly there is always some important point to be made in his films. "Lord of War" is one that defines a problem without attempting to offer a solution.  Indeed, the punch line at the end of this one, which is reinforced by the facts related before the end titles, makes it clear no solution is possible.  Yuri's final words put a spin on what has transpired, but you have to think people in the audience are just focusing on the horror and the madness of it all.  Then again, Cage's performance makes you root for Yuri despite the fact that what he is doing is bad, which makes him a bad person.<br /><br />The evil of being a "Lord of War" is the overriding point of the film and that judgment is supposed to overcome some of the problems with the narrative.  Yuri does a lot of the work in the field by himself, which seems a tad dangerous to me, but I guess part of the attraction here is that he is glib enough to survive living on the razor's edge.  But I really do not understand why he wants his brother with him ever again once he clearly becomes a liability.  Again, it is Cage's performance that forgives a lot of these concerns and Niccol does have a payoff for the big set up.  The results are not great, but certainly well worth watching.</p></body></html>

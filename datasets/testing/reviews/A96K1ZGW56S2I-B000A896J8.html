Since its release on DVD I have heard many positive things about the movie and finally was able to view the movie for myself.<br /><br />The movie takes place during the Middle Ages and revolves around a blacksmith named Balian (Orlando Bloom).  Balian's wife committed suicide after the death of their child and he finds himself alone and living in a village where very few of the other villagers like him.  Lord Godfrey (Liam Neeson) returns home to find Balian, his long lost son and ask him to return with him to the Jerusalem, the Kingdom of Heaven.  At first Balian refuses, but after murdering a priest Balian joins his father in hopes that in fighting in Jerusalem he can be given absolution for both his and his wife's sins.  Jerusalem is somewhat unstable.  The King of Jerusalem, Baldwin IV (Edward Norton) is a leper with no heir to the throne.  Baldwin is a good man and has been able to maintain a peaceful existence with the surrounding Muslim nations.  Baldwin lived longer than anyone expected him to, but each day that passes finds him weaker.  His sister, Sibylla (Eva Green) will inherit the throne after his death and there are several factions fighting amongst themselves for control of the city after Baldwin dies.  Balian enters the scene and wins the trust of some of the nobles, such as Tiberius (Jeremy Irons) and the King himself.  Balian also wins the affections of Sibylla which causes her supposed soon to betrothed Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) to hate Balian more.  Knights Templar under the direction of Guy force a war with the Muslim warrior Saladin (Ghasssan Massoud) after which Balian finds himself forced to be true knight for the people.<br /><br />I know that this version of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN wasn't the version director Ridley Scott had attended.  His version of the film is about an hour longer, but I haven't seen that one yet.  This version of the film is the version that was seen in theatres and as it stands by itself, it isn't too bad of a movie.  The acting is strong through most of the cast.  Orlando Bloom has taken a lot of slack for giving a poor performance, but in reality he doesn't do to bad of a job.  It is true that Bloom is really too much of a pretty boy to be playing Balian (knights weren't always the best looking people around), but the weakness of his character comes not from his performance but from the writing of his character.  The opening scene is supposed to form empathy with the audience, but it doesn't do that.  Therefore, a connection with Bloom's Balian is never really made.<br /><br />The movie has some great action sequences and the cinematography is spectacular.  Great lengths were taken in making detailed weapons and costumes and the siege of Jerusalem is one of the most accurate scenes of siege warfare about an actual real life battle that I have ever seen on screen.  Ridley Scott did a great job of bringing this film together.<br /><br />However, it doesn't work as well as it could have.  Much of this is because Scott's version of the film was cut dramatically.  There are points in the movie where you can tell a scene is missing.  I believe that the other reason the film isn't as powerful as it could be is because of the writing.  Characters that should be written strong, such as Balian, aren't.  Other minor characters come off being more important than they should be while characters that should have a crucial role to play in the film, such as Saladin's sister, aren't on screen more than a few seconds.  KINGDOM OF HEAVEN was William Monahan's first major accredited script so these flaws might just be the learning curve of a major screenwriting.<br /><br />KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is a pretty good historical picture.  It's a decent film to introducing people to the Crusades, but it's also just a fun film to watch on a Saturday night.<br /><br />This DVD version of the script includes a text commentary, some behind the scenes featurettes, a History Channel special entitled "History Vs. Hollywood--Kingdom of Heaven", and a special that aired on A&E called "Movie Real:  Kingdom of Heaven".  The History Channel companion piece is the better of the two major special features.  It starts off with Ridley Scott and the major actors talking about the film and then segue ways into examining the Crusades, Crusaders, Medieval castles, and Medieval weapons.  The A&E special is atrocious, though, and is basically a piece of propaganda.  The Movie Real feature is anything but real and includes conversations with the actors of the film as if they are real historians.  Half of the historians in the piece have a severely biased and flawed view of the Crusades and the time in history that THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN takes place and instead of introducing information that the film in someway ignores (such as the fact that Balian had an older brother named Baldwin), these historians perpetuates many of the myths of the film.  For example, none of the historians ever mention that before any of the Crusades started that Christians had been persecuted by Muslims and were no longer allowed to visit the Holy Places in Jerusalem as they had been doing for centuries. There are many more documentaries about the crusades and I would advise watching one of them and just ignore the `A&E Movie Real" altogether.</p></body></html>

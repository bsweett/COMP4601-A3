I don't feel the director or the scriptwriter had any insights into that battle, into the the lives of their characters, or into the mind of the Japanese that anybody else doesn't.  It was all so stereotypical.<br /><br />Plus:  couldn't tell the characters apart, as they all look the same and Eastwood does nothing about this.  The guy who was taken from his wife?  I thought he died like 3 times!  Was he the guy with the shovel at the end?  (Before branding me a racist, bear in mind I had the same complaint about the companion movie, "Flags of Our Fathers.")</p></body></html>

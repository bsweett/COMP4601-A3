<meta name="summary" content="Sci-Fi at its best!"></head><body><p>This intense Sci-Fi/horror is what I call 'smart' sci-fi because it gets us emotionally attached to the characters 'before' anything shows up to attack or eat them, that way we really care if something happens. I recently saw a movie (won't mention the name) where the characters were so annoying I was cheering for the monster. I Am Legend is a high caliber movie in its genre and I've always thought Will Smith gives one hundred percent to all the roles he plays. This tale is a cautionary warning of how we humans can really mess up. A virus developed as a hopeful cure to cancer becomes a deadly infection that turns humans into hideous beings that hover in the dark, unable to live in the sunlight. Very few people are immune to it and the city of New York is closed off. Will Smith plays a doctor who dedicates the remainder of his life to try and find a cure, lonely and left only with his dog, our hearts ache for him. I must say the creatures were truly creepy.  They didn't go overboard on the effects, it's the subtle approach that makes them extremely horrid and too realistic looking. I always crave the truly happy ending, but what can I say, this film met me half-way in that area. Maybe some of us need to get over our happy ending cravings.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

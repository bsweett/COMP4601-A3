It was about a hit man who lost his memory, and is now trying to find out why so many people are after him and why he has so many different passports.  He is in for a lot of suprises.  I reccomend it to any action film fan.  The reason I only gave it three stars is because it had an awful ending and I didn't like the female lead.</p></body></html>

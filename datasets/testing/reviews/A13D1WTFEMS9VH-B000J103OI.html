<meta name="summary" content="'That Girl' Meets Haute Couture"></head><body><p>'The Devil Wears Prada' felt like a cinematic version of the old TV show 'That Girl' mated to a frenetic score, with the pretension of giving us a behind-the-scenes look at the fashion biz. Anne Hathaway is a real sweetheart, that's for sure. Her sappy Teddy Bear boyfriend was not very believable, though, with his "I'd rather you wear a sweatshirt and no makeup than see you looking drop-dead gorgeous in all those hot, expensive clothes!" attitude. Yeah, right. Neither, to me, was the character played by Streep believable. An underlying premise was that if she were a man acting so boorishly, no one would think twice. Perhaps this might be true for anyone lacking self respect. If she was a guy and talked to me like that, I'd deck her. Since she isn't, I'd simply tear her a new one verbally, toss her Prada shoes and Gucci whatever out the window and blow my nose on her Herm&egrave;s scarf.<br /><br />In the end, this is strictly a predictable chick flick. I mean, was the d&eacute;nouement ever really in doubt? Hardly.</p></body></html>

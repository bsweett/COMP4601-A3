<meta name="summary" content="A real old-fashioned western"></head><body><p>Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp who has retired from his life as a lawman and who goes to the wild town of Tombstone to make his fortune.  He is accompanied by his wife and his brothers and rejoins his old friend Doc Holliday.  Val Kilmer puts in the best performance of the movie in his portrayal of the self-destructive, high-living Holliday.  Kurt Russell is also good as Wyatt Earp.  There is lots of beautiful scenery and the gorgeous shots of sunrises and sunsets is juxtaposed with the raw violence of the gun battles.  This is a great movie for Western fans.</p></body></html>

I don't like the lame corporate product junk regularly pinched off on our movie screens every weekend.  CGI video games for little boys.  Romantic-comedies that are so bland that they all look the same (there are about nine between Jennifer Aniston entries, by my count).  Raunchy comedies that aren't funny (two words: Seth Rogen).  I can't even remember the last time I thought, "I've got to see that."<br /><br />However, Wes Anderson is killing my enthusiasm for all art-house or independent films.<br /><br />He knows that people go to movies...to be entertained, right?<br /><br />Number one: I hate these characters.  I've been on international trips and have been exposed to some truly awful people, fellow tourists without any tact or even a clue...I'll take any one of them for a week over these hang-dog idiots for an hour and a half (even the fat, old lady I had to listen to across the Med and into the Holy Land, whose constant griping reached a hilarious crescendo in St. Mark's Square in Venice).<br /><br />Number two: I still hate these characters.  By the end, I thought, "Who cares?"  This family is a mess.  Nothing is resolved.  They grin.  Finally, some emotion.  Over what?  Who cares?<br /><br />Here's how to make a Wes Anderson film: get talented actors and tell them to stare into a camera lens, devoid of expression.  Give them inscrutable dialogue that passes as funny when explained later, but it has to come across as empty line readings--HAS to be completely emotionless and deadpan.<br /><br />Take the exotic location away and you have THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, which I thought was horrible too.  I've suffered through all of his films now...and it's now genuine suffering.  Between Wes Anderson and the Broken Lizard losers, I don't know whose new film I'd be most nauseated by.  The Broken Lizard guys don't know how to entertain.  Wes Anderson acts like he knows...but he refuses to.  Which is worse?</p></body></html>

After about 30 minutes, one of them commented, "Is this suppose to be a comedy?" That's pretty much the feeling for the first half of the film, but once the characters are established, the viewer is set up for one of the most charming displays of a family bonding ever in a film.<br /><br />The family is extremely messed up. It felt like we were visiting a home where we were seeing things that we shouldn't be seeing. It was painful and compelling at the same time because you could tell that everyone cared for each other very much but all their personal BS was getting in the way of them making healthy connections to each other.<br /><br />After watching this I thought it was very funny and thought-provoking film. Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear are totally believable and utterly great as the struggling couple, trying their best to keep themselves going for the sake of their determined daughter. Abigail Breslin is adorable and perfect in the role of Olive, and does all the right things to make us really love her as if she were our own sister or daughter. Steve Carrell and Alan Arkin deliver subtle yet wonderful performances as well, though I wish Arkin had more screen time (this was the film's only lacking point). Paul Dano was absolutely spot-on with his portrayal of Duane; his "leave me here scene" had me feeling so empathetic it was almost too real and too close to home (a sign of pure brilliance in his performance, the script and direction).<br /><br />The whole film feels like something snatched right out of the most bizarre area of reality, good visuals, lovable characters, and a script that never fails to be entertaining. "Little Miss Sunshine" is one of the most enjoyable comedy films I have seen this past movie year.</p></body></html>

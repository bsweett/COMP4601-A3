<meta name="summary" content="nicely done, but some parts are dumb"></head><body><p>nicely done thriller with a different version of the Agatha Christie novel with 12 strangers stranded at a inn and then they all start to die some how. great suspense and mystery keeps you at bay till the shocking revealing of whats really happening. an all star cast includes the awesome John Cusack and Ray Liotta. The sexy Amanda Peet. Jake Busey, Rebecca DeMornay, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Clea DuVall, William Lee Scott and John C. McGinley are also among the grat cast in work here. but some parts are a little dumb in this movie and could've been done better</p></body></html>

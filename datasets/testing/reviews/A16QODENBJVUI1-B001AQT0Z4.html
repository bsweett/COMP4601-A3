<meta name="summary" content="One of the great and most original films of the nineties"></head><body><p>A decade after Quentin Tarantino produced two absolute classics in RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION, many of us are still waiting for him to redisplay the enormous virtuosity evidence in both of these films. Although not a bad film, FOXY BROWN was a bit of a disappointment, and we will have to wait and see what happens with KILL BILL and INGLORIOUS BASTARDS, the former finished and scheduled for a fall 2003 release, the latter scheduled to begin shooting in late 2003. For me, PULP FICTION was as original and as exciting as any film I had seen in ages when it came out in 1994, and I was looking forward to a worthy successor to it. I am still looking forward to it.  (Note:  in late 1994 I was even asked by a WGN Chicago film crew--which was polling Chicagoans leaving the theater--my favorite film of the year, and I replied instantly:  PULP FICTION.)<p>This disappointment aside, PULP FICTION was one of the most incredible film experiences of my life. Retaining much of the edge and incredible dialog that was found in both RESERVOIR DOGS and TRUE ROMANCE, for which Tarantino wrote the script, but injecting precisely the right blend of Americana and popular culture, the film blew me out of my seat. Immediately after seeing it, I saw it again, and then again. The film had style and swagger to burn, humor to soften the violence and give it a surreal turn, and simple the greatest talk I had ever heard in the movies. All the characters in the film love to talk, and many are brilliant at it. <p>PULP FICTION is filled with more great moments than are usually found in three or four good films added together. Many of the segments are more or less self-contained, and would be classics on their own, but added to the others produce something even greater than the sum of its parts. You get the extraordinary hit that Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta make at the beginning of the film. The surreal trip to the nostalgia diner and twist contest with Travolta and Uma Thurman. The unbelievable sequence with Bruce Willis and the "Gimp." Christopher Walken's tale about the watch and its presentation to the young Bruce Willis character. And this listing doesn't come close to naming all the best moments in the film, and leaves out perhaps the best of the bunch, Samuel L. Jackson's extraordinary scene to end the film. <p>What a cast! There are a host of great performances, although I have to express some perplexity as to why Travolta received the nomination for Best Actor and not Samuel L. Jackson. While Travolta has one more scene than Jackson, in all the scenes where the two are together, Jackson absolutely and utterly dominates the action. We don't listen to Travolta; we listen to Jackson. If you removed Travolta from those scenes, nothing would be lost. Remove Jackson, and you wouldn't have anything remotely resembling the same scene. Still, Travolta is good, if not as dominating as Jackson. So many performers excel: Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, the stunning Harvey Keitel, Eric Stolz, Christopher Walken. And to this day it remains the best thing that Bruce Willis has ever done.<p>Special mention must also be made of the superb soundtrack. I'm not sure that a soundtrack has ever been used to greater effect than in this one, from edgy rawness of Dick Dale's "Misirlou" (helping to reacquaint many with the man who truly is the King of the Surf Guitar) to Dusty Springfield's "Son of a Preacher Man" to Al Green's "Let's Stay Together" to Chuck Berry's "You Never Can Tell" the music doesn't merely adorn the film but establishes the proper mood and carries the story forward.</p></body></html>

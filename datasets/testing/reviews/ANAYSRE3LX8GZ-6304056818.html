<meta name="summary" content="Great Visual FX For a 50's Movie."></head><body><p>I admit I had never heard of this movie before. I did recignise the robot from it's cameo appearences since (Well, Gremlins, anyway)<br /><br />I usualy sit down and look at these old films and laugh at how bad they are, or how there ideas of the future are so laughable, or the really s####y SFX they had. But I actualy can not do that to this movie! I was actualy impressed at how they did some of the effects for this. Even tho I can tell they where drawn is as a cartoon, they are done exceptionly well for a 1956 film.<br /><br />The only thing I laughed at was Leslie Nielson looking so young! It was weird watchign him do strait acting, but after a while I got into it. I can see why it's a classic easily. I could even instantly see that Lost In Space ripped it off quite a bit.<br /><br />It wont suprise me to see this movie being re-made in the near future. It starts well, continues well, and ends well. All 3 elements of making a good film. With some respectable SFX thrown in for extra enjoyment. Campy, but enjoyable.</p></body></html>

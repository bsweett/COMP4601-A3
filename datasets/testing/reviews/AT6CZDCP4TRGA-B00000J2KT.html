<meta name="summary" content="Schizophrenic, just like war..."></head><body><p>Most people think that this is really 2 movies in 1: the Marine boot camp first half, the Vietnam combat 2nd half. Actually they are two sides of the same coin.<br /><br /> I agree with the Boston Globe's assesment that this is &quot;the greatest war movie ever made.&quot; It captures the essence of war: the mass psychological programming that makes it possible, and the concrete results of that programming when it comes in contact with reality.<br /><br /> A lot of people criticize the second half as being slow, abrupt, pointless, ugly and anticlimactic---which, of course, is exactly how war IS, especially the Vietnam war.<br /><br /> ...The movie suggests that both forms of innocence/humanity must be killed if one is to &quot;get with the program&quot; of war fighting---a program that is by terms hideous, brutal, corrupt---and absolutely, hilariously absurd.<br /><br /> In contrast to today's Bush Jr.'s simpleton yee-haw post-9/11 view of the world, Kubrick's film presents a much more ambiguous and therefore more richly accurate picture: There are no good guys, there are no bad guys, there are just guys who kill and guys who get killed, and there's no telling which category you'll find yourself in, 'cause it's just one big crazy Mickey Mouse show out there, in this &quot;world of s--t.&quot;<br /><br /> Right-wing lovers of patriotic kitsch need not apply!</p></body></html>

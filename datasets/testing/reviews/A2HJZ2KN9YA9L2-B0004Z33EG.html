<meta name="summary" content="Best commentary on any DVD"></head><body><p>This first Rambo movie is actually pretty entertaining.  Rambo isn't the self-righteous hero as he is a lost soul, providing strong parallels to Frankenstein's Monster.  Those who have read Mary Shelley's novel may recall that the monster was given life but could not die.  This also seems to be Rambo's dilemma.  All of his friends have died, but even though he throughs himself off a cliff into some trees, he manages to escape with only a few injuries.  Rambo is a man looking for comfort who is misunderstood because of a monstrous appearance.  Col. Trautman fills the role of Dr. Frankenstein -- The first words out of his mouth are &quot;God didn't invent Rambo.  I did.&quot;  But unlike Dr. Frankenstein who abandoned his monster, Col. Trautman came to take responsibilty for his creation, to try to calm him down.<p>Now let me sing the praises of the commentary on this disk, given by author David Morrell. He never stops providing constant insight into comparing his book to the film, how the Rambo phenomena has influenced his life, an analysis of the character of Rambo as he is supposed to be representative of the Liberals (surprising as the sequels seemed to be more Republican in theme) and how the Rambo character ties into the Heroic cycle, praise of the music cues as well as certain action sequences.  He also talks about the movie cycle on the whole and how with each movie Rambo became more &amp; more invincible, and his knife got larger &amp; larger.  David Morrell's commentary is the best that I have encountered on any DVD anywhere.  Even those who hate the Rambo movies may find enjoyment in David Morrell's commentary.</p></body></html>

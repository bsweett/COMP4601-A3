<meta name="summary" content="Hollywood Cronyism Rides Again &lt;Horse Whinny>"></head><body><p>In my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M4RG42">Flags of Our Fathers</a>, I mentioned that I wasn't sure if I'd be watching this flipside film based on the Japanese experience. My fears were twofold. First is that director Clint Eastwood lacks character development, and I was afraid he'd continue his trend with LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA. Second (and more recently noted within myself) is that I absolutely love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVSC">Tora! Tora! Tora!</a> Similarities between it and the new Eastwood additions cannot be denied. Although Tora focused on the Pearl Harbor attack and not Iwo Jima, it did look at both sides of the war (Japan and America.) I feared that Dirty Harry might muddy the film-waters of Tora! Tora! Tora!<br /><br />Thankfully the latter didn't happen, but the former trend continues.<br /><br />With the exception of Ken Watanabe's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVMY">Memoirs of a Geisha</a>) portrayal of General Kuribayashi and Kazunari Ninomiya's Saigo, there were few characters with which the audience could identify. We care little for any of these doomed men simply because we don't know them well enough. The story itself is historically interesting, of course, and it's well told. But the lack of empathy viewers will have for any of the characters will likely plague this film to its bitter end.<br /><br />Where Tora! Tora! Tora! succeeded was not simply in its storytelling, but also in that we got in tight with everyone involved. From Martin Balsam's gruff Pacific Fleet Admiral to So Yamamura's demanding Vice-Admiral Yamamoto presence, all of the characters had some important measure within the film's scheme. Clint Eastwood seems to have had trouble doing this with two lengthy movies (Flags was 132 minutes long and Letters 141 minutes while Tora alone was just 144 minutes.)<br /><br />The thing I don't want to do here is disrespect (in any way) what happened on this little spit of land in the Pacific. The horrors were real and Mr. Eastwood does a fair job showing us some pretty abhorrent conditions the Japanese were subjected to. Clint Eastwood is a fine filmmaker, but he's not the finest. And this is also where I have a beef with the Oscar board members.<br /><br />This film is in a foreign language and yet it got nominated in the "Best Picture" category at last year's Oscars. I realize that the director is American, but that alone surely shouldn't dictate the category in which it's placed come awards time, should it? Almost all of the remaining awards ceremonies placed it in the "Foreign Language" category but not The Academy of Motion Picture Arts. A bit of cronyism going on? Banish the thought!</p></body></html>

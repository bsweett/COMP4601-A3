<meta name="summary" content=""The Thunder of God""></head><body><p>The film that kicked off the 90s disaster movie revival, Twister is a spectacle, pure and very simple, with just enough plot to propel you to the next big set piece of destruction as ex-stormchaser Bill Paxton finds himself swept up in the thrill of the chase as he tries to get Helen Hunt to sign their divorce papers. Don't look for anything profound - Cary Elwes' villainous better-funded rivals even drive black vans while, after the film goes to enormous lengths to stress how all-powerful the twisters are by throwing oil tankers and even houses at them, the heroes survive by, er, tying themselves to some pipes and holding on very tight. Yet the special effects are suitably apocalyptic while the film has a real sense of speed and motion thanks to some great helicopter and driving work, and even the presence of two of the most irritatingly mannered supporting actors in the business, Philip Seymour Hoffman (in the Jack Black role) and Jeremy Davies, doesn't dampen the dumb fun. And no doubt about it, the cow is definitely the star of the show.<br /><br />After  a previous underwhelming  release, the 2-disc  set  finally gives  the film a  decent  selection  of  extras even if the transfer  doesn't  appear to be an imprpvement on the previous  issue.</p></body></html>

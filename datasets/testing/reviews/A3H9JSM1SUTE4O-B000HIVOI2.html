It's a little misleading to call this the &quot;Ultimate Edition) as it merely transfers  the director's cut of the film from the previous &quot;Special Edition&quot; (but now in anamorphic and not letterbox widescreen) which includes nine additional minutes cut from the theatrical and subsequent first DVD version. Got that straight?  Cool extras abound, however.  <p>There's a spooky documentary in which Erich Von Daniken discusses his &quot;Chariots of the God's&quot; theory of extra-terrestrial visitations in ancient times. The sound on the feature has been remixed in a thunderous 6.1 DTS ES track. There are commentaries and a nice 23 minute making-of featurette.</p></body></html>

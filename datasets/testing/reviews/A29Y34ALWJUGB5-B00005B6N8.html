<meta name="summary" content="A New Age Sci-fi Movie"></head><body><p>I have to start by saying that I saw the Chronicles of Riddick before I saw Pitch Black, so I already knew the character of the anti-hero protagonist in both stories. That said, I'm happy I did, because Pitch Black comes off as your everyday space horror that attempted to steal some of the success that the Alien movies had. The stand out in this movie is the main character, Riddick, and how true the writers kept that character through-out the story. You had your expectations for Riddick, and he goes just a little beyond them while never actually disappointing or become predictable.<br /><br />The story begins like most sci-fi movies, that being a view of the galaxy to let us know that this is a sci-fi movie. Soon after, though, the ship that all the characters are traveling in hits a small asteroid belt that tears the hull apart, and they are forced to crash land on a planet with three suns and a never-ending desert. Oh, and with strange creatures that hate the light, but these come later, after we understand what's going on with Riddick and the crew of unfortunate survivors that become his prey.<br /><br />When finally they do come, though, a sort of understanding comes between the other characters and Riddick, and they realize that they must get off the planet soon. Thus starts the heart-pounding run across the desert landscape to an abandoned ship. All the while, character infighting threatens to separate them, and does in some cases. By the end it becomes both a fight for survival and a fight to retain one's morals. The ending is obvious, somebody has to escape, but it's who ends up escaping that is the surprise.<br /><br />Another thing that separates this movie from other sci-fi movies is that it doesn't even try to present a strange, alien world. In fact, you barely ever see the aliens that are in this story, and they are actually presented more as beasts than intelligent creatures. There are no made-up races of strange looking creatures (like Star Wars) or the never ending stream of humanoid, bipedal aliens (like Star Trek) that gets monotonous. This movie presents its own ideas on sci-fi, and does so successfully.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie, and its sequel, to anyone tired of Star Wars or Star Trek (I was never a really big fan myself). Its new ideas are refreshing. I'd also recommend this movie to horror fans who liked Aliens, as it has some similar moments. But most of all, I'd recommend this movie to writers or young screenwriters, as it has one of the best, well-written characters ever created in Riddick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A TRIP"></head><body><p>Julie Taymor's incredibly energetic homage to the music of the Beatles has an undeniable pop power, driven largely by an overactive imagination and those indelibly perfect songs.  I found the music to be truly affecting, gorgeously and creatively arranged and winningly sung by the game young cast.  The plot is really an excuse for production numbers and specific songs to make their way into the film, but as a loosely strung together series of such moments, darned if it doesn't start to become emotionally engaging.  The wonderfully anachronistic appearance of Bono as a trippy dippy new age psychobabbler delights, as does the almost unrecognizable Eddie Izzard.  It all moves quickly, and many of the visuals have the jagged, sincere look of a senior film school thesis.  But by the time everyone is singing Hey Jude and All You Need Is Love, I dare you not to smile...it's hard to resist!</p></body></html>

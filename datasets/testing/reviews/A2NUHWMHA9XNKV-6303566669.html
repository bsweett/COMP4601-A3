<meta name="summary" content="one of my  favorite Sci-fi flick of all time!"></head><body><p>The Terminator is one of the most important films of our time. James Cameron is a genius. I knew it then. And, of course, it's apparent to everyone now. James makes flawless films. Even taking into account the lack of high-tech special effects in the first Terminator compared to the wizardry we have today, you have to realize this is an all time great! This movie never loses it's punch or appeal---even twenty years later! James gives us a gutsy female heroine (Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor) long before they became popular. (Look at ''Charlie's Angels''.) But Cameron writes characters who are REAL. Who doesn't identify with Sarah Connor? The always underrated Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese is as superb as he is darling and appealing. Check out Bill Paxton (who would go on to be featured in and eventually star in more of Cameron's films) in the opening sequence as an unfortunate ''punk'' and his punk friends who meet the Terminator! And wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the single minded killing machine. Arnold and James make wonderful movies together. Who doesn't enjoy an Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi flick? As James Cameron has said about Arnold, (not exact quote)-He takes direction very well and can physically and emotionally do exactly as the director envisions. Arnold is just great and just keeps getting better. When I first saw this film, I told friends I thought that was funny when Arnold said ''I'll be back.'' It is a truly captivating line....I was right! That line became Arnold's most famous ''catch phrase''! You cannot miss seeing this movie and no home DVD/Video library should be without it! Yes, this movie is A#1 in my book-----exciting, frightening, riveting, romantic and unforgettable. If you don't love it, you're simply not a sci-fi movie lover. This one is the best of them all.<br /><br />Also Recommended: Alien; Predator;  of course T2-Judgement Day; Time After Time; The Time Machine (original and remake); Soldier</p></body></html>

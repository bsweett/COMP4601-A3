<meta name="summary" content=""I'm giving very serious thought... to eating your wife""></head><body><p>I'm reviewing this movie as it stands on it's own rather than how it fits into the series.<br /><br />In this installment, we meet Mason Verger, who is the sole survivor of the good Dr Lechter.  Verger is a strange character with a strange story.  His intentions are fairly clear from the outset, leaving the viewer only to watch how things unfold.<br /><br />The movie remains fairly interesting throughout, as the escaped Lechter is identified and opposing forces close in on him.  The table is set, however, about an hour in when we see Lechter dispatch his first would-be apprehender with a touch of "historical flair".<br /><br />Lechter and Clarice are soon after back in touch again and the time finally comes where they meet and communicate without the glass between them. So we have Verger with retribution at heart, Clarice with justice in her interest and Lechter with his usual intentions: a tasty recipe indeed, with a main course as bizarre as you will come to expect.<br /><br />This is a must-see for fans of the original and fans of the series in general.</p></body></html>

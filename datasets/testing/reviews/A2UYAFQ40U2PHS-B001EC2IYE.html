<meta name="summary" content="5 stars isn't enough for this majestic, moving, heartbreaking film....one of the best films I've seen in the last 15 years"></head><body><p>This film is a masterpiece. It is absolutely brilliant.  It is reminscent of The Decalogue, a series of films directed by Krystof Kieslowski about the 10 Commandments. It addresses the moral questions (along with the moral ambiguity) that we may all have to face. It doesn't do it in a condescending, Hollywoodesque way. It does it in an adult way. The film stayed with me for days afterwards. I have watched several Eastwood directed films since seeing this one, and I think Clint is sorely underrappreciated as a filmmaker. He has directed 26 films (his latest, Flag of Our Fathers, is due out in 2006).  He isn't an actor (like Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson) who occasionally steps behind a camera.  He's a real, legitimate filmmaker, and he displays a sensitivity and subtlety that are so rare in Hollywood these days, reminiscent of old Hollywood masters like John Ford.  He is a true artist, a great filmmaker that should be spoken about alongside the greats.  And his artistry comes through this film in every frame.  Only a true artist with the depth and substance of Eastwood could have made this heartbreaking, thought provoking film.  ADDENUM...Check out the Producer's 15 segment on the DVD.  Tom Rosenberg, one of the producers of this film, makes some hilariously pointed comments about directors.  He compares how inefficient and pretentious other directors are compared to Clint, who is arguably one of the most workmanlike, unpretentious, and excellent filmmakers in Hollywood today.</p></body></html>

It is simply because it is still, over half a century later, an astonishing piece of work.  Absolutely stunning, using every trick &amp; device ever invented in movie making, and coming at them with such freshness and originality, decontructing and reconstructing them into something new &amp; unique, that the word &quot;genius&quot; was invented to describe such efforts.<p>I dislike how that word genius is bandied about so much today describing everything from gifted natural athletes to clever comedians and politicians.  I rarely use it myself.  But, if this wasn't a work of genius, I don't know what would qualify.  This is such a grown-up movie, telling an archetypal American story, but with brilliance in every frame and every line of dialogue.  Is is so mature a work, made under the strictures of the Hayes code, that it makes most of what we see today, without virtually any limits, look like the work of children.<p>AND it was made with such economy!  Really a low-budget project, through sheer brilliance a Big Story is told modestly, without a wasted shot or line of dialogue, by terrific editing and intelligent construction.  Intelligence is what you see everywhere in Citizen Kane, especially in its humor...and funny it is as well.<p>I could go on, but why bother? If you don't &quot;get it&quot; if you find it &quot;boring&quot; nothing I say will change your mind.  I will say this, if that is  your reaction, you know nothing about film-making.  Citizen Kane is an exhaustive primer in brilliant film-making.  Welles threw in the kitchen sink!  That it was a 25 year old's first movie , while not important to your enjoyment or appreciation of the film, is finally just awsome.  The continual inventiveness in scene after scene is dizzying.<p>The DVD has lots of goodies.  An excellent documentary on the background of the struggle to make and release the film and William Randolph Hearst's (somewhat understandable) effort to destroy it.  There are comments and even regrets by Welles...he was a young man tearing down an old man and there is cruelty in it.  There are 2 very different and excellent commentary tracks by Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert.  The former more a friend's recollections, the latter an intense analysis of the art of the film-making.  All in all, a very nice package.<br />The restored film is beautiful.<p>One of my oldest memories is sitting in front of a B&amp;W television mesmerized by the opening of Citizen Kane.  I must have been 10, and I don't recall if I watched it all, and certainly wouldn't have understood it all, but I was completely entranced by the sheer look of the film.  I had never seen anything like it.  It was pure Magic!  And &quot;magic&quot; it remains to film lovers the world over.  Nuff said.</p></body></html>

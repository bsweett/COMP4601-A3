<meta name="summary" content="This is my favorite HP movie"></head><body><p>I am not a fan of wizards and magic. I've never read a Harry Potter book, but for some reasonm I enjoy the movies very much. Maybe it is just nice to escape reality for a little while and root for a very unasuming hero. What I always seem to like about Harry Potter is that he always lands on top but seldom knows what he's doing. Also it's nice to see action movies without the typical muscle bound hero who leaves everything behind him in a fire of explosions.<br /><br />The Goblet of Fire chooses who will compete in a TriWizard Tournament. Harry is not allowed to enter because of his age, but he ends up being entered as a fourth contestant. It is only at the end that we discover 'you know who' is behind it all for his own evil purposes, like being born again.<br /><br />The wizard tournament events are spectacular, stealing a golden egg from a dragon, saving friends from mer-people, and the scariest hedge maze since The Shining.<br /><br />Of course this flick has a sub plot about the kids at Hogwarts growing up and beginning to notice the opposite sex. A grand dance is given on Christmas Eve and those ackward moments are in abundance prior to and during. Harry may be able to fly a broom stick and outmaneuver a dragon, fight off underwater monsters, and face 'who know who' but he can't dance. You can't win them all.<br /><br />Great flick with superb special effects that make you forget it's all computers.</p></body></html>

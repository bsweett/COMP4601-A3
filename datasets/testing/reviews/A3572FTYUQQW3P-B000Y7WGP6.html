<meta name="summary" content="Good Muslims & Bad Muslims Meet the FBI"></head><body><p>This is an action packed film that lacks any originality and whose sole purpose seems to be to show a)The intolerance of Saudi Muslims b) the ignorance and dysfunctionality of our State Department c) Christians use profanity while Muslims do not d)not all Muslims are hate filled but there are a few who are rational.  The plot was really pretty thin, the characters not well developed,and  the objective of the movie seemed to be to get to the final gun battle.<br /><br />There were a number of logical flaws and the first comes at the beginning of the film where it is daylight in Saudi Arabia and one hour later it is daylight in Washington D.C.  This doesn't detract from the film but it is indicative to the lack of attention to detail that seems to plague this film.  It does manage to show -- without actually stating the point -- that Christians are not allowed in Saudi Arabia and those that are necessary are barely tolerated and certainly restricted. The FBI sends a female agent to Saudi Arabia -- a country where women have no rights, who are not allowed to drive, who are expected to have their heads covered at all times, and a place where the men would not speak to a woman outside of their immediate family.  Yet the FBI sends her and the only purpose seemed to be was to get to the one point where she is denied access because she is a woman but at all other times she is treated like the men. Not logical but there it is! The gun battle is amazing because the number of rounds fired rivaled D Day.  It was like the old westerns where the six guns never ran out of ammo and never had to be reloaded. Of course the good guys have infallible aim while the bad guys -- who outnumber them and are more heavily armed -- can't hit the side of a barn with a cannon -- in this case rocket propelled grenades.  Then this gun battle takes place in a building which appears to be an empty apartment building because all of the rooms are empty except the one where the terrorist family is living.  This is not viewed as suspicious until it is too late.  Of course the "good" Muslim gets killed because this allowed the director and screen play to drive home the multi-cultural rapport between the FBI agent and the Muslim Officer.<br /><br />So this is a heavily flawed film but I give it four stars because it is exciting and the gun battle -- flawed as it is -- will certainly get your adrenalin flowing.</p></body></html>

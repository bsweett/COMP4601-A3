First, Harry and Dudley encounter a pair of dementors in Little Whinging, one of which almost manages to steal Dudley's soul.  Harry happens to have his wand on him, however, and repels both dementors using the Patronus charm.  That action causes him to get expelled from Hogwarts, but soon after, his expulsion is rescinded pending a trial hearing.  Mad-Eye and the rest of the Order come to break Harry out, and they head to the headquarters of the Order, formerly Sirius' childhood home.  From there, they speed onward to Hogwarts, where things are anything but how they've been.<br /><br />For starters, Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, is absolutely resolute in denying that Voldemort is back.  Also, he uses the incident with Harry's Patronus to place more and more Ministry restrictions on Hogwarts, starting with the appointment of one of Fudge's own subordinates, Senior Undersecretary Dolores Umbridge, as the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher.  Soon, under Umbridge's tutelage, DaDA becomes, not a place where magic is used, but a place where magic is taught, because, in the words of Umbridge, "Who do you think would want to use magic against you out there?"  Not only that, but Umbridge (through Fudge) gets a whole load of Ministry Decrees passed, further tightening the Ministry's control over Hogwarts.<br /><br />A main part of the Order of the Phoenix movie is Harry's formation of Dumbledore's Army (DA).  Since Umbridge won't teach them defensive magic, Harry vows to do just that for anyone who is willing.  The DA originally consists of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but soon a whole slew of other characters join, including Neville, who, up until this point, had been lacking in the magical abilities department.  Also, Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape are included here, as is Voldemort's attempts to get into Harry's mind using Legilimency.  Finally, the Battle at the Ministry, where Voldemort finally reveals himself to the Ministry and the remainder of the Order.<br /><br />As my title says, Order of the Phoenix is the best movie out of the five that have been released, but I have a few big problems with how they handled the transition from book to movie, the main one being time.  How can they justify taking the longest Harry Potter book yet and making into the shortest Harry Potter movie yet?  Many crucial scenes were cut out, including (not really crucial, but certainly enjoyable) Ron's Quidditch tryouts (and Quidditch in general is cut completely out), Harry and the gang's meeting with Neville and his Crucio-ed mother in St. Mungo's during Christmas break, Dumbledore's conversation with Harry at the end was cut by about 3/4, Harry's excursion into Snape's memory changed (in the book, he found out about his father's torturing Snape through the Pensieve, but in the movie, it's when Harry Protegos Snape's Legilimens spell)... I realize time constraints are a factor, but cutting an 870-page book down to a mere 2 and 1/2 hour movie is beyond me.<br /><br />In spite of the completely unsatisfactory length, I was very much satisfied with the actor choices for the new parts.  Coming in for her first ever movie role is the beautiful Evanna Lynch, who plays the eccentric Luna Lovegood.  Personally, Evanna is the best actor in the whole movie, not to mention my favorite actress; she really captures the personality of Luna very well.  Gary Oldman returns for his second stab at the character of Sirius Black, and pulls off a very convincing performance.  Michael Gambon is at his best this film, as he plays Dumbledore's character to a tee.  Another actress making her first Harry Potter movie debut is Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the demented Bellatrix Lestrange; Imelda Staunton performs admirably as Professor Dolores Umbridge, the most hated character in the movie; and finally... returning for his fifth time is Alan Rickman, who once again shows the world that there can only be one true Severus Snape, and that is he.<br /><br />Also, character development is a key part that OotP and director David Yates pull off spectacularly.  We see Neville, who before couldn't do as much as a Disarming Spell, grow into quite the formidable wizard, even attempting to battle Bellatrix when they meet in the Ministry.  We see Hermione... okay, so no real change occurs in Hermione; she's still the brave know-it-all, except this time around, she's more accepting of breaking the rules (leading to Ron's classic line "Who are you and what have you done with Hermione Granger?"). And then there's Ron, who, unfortunately, is pretty much shunted to the back in favor of Hermione's more affable personality; his biggest scene (not including the battle scene) is his defending of Harry when Seamus rips him for believing that Voldemort is back.  Finally, Luna really gets her time in the spotlight, being one of the first to master Harry's teaching the Patronus spell; also, her relationship with Harry deepens alot (does anyone else besides me think that Luna's got a HUGE crush on Harry?) and she starts making friends with Ron and Hermione a bit more, too.<br /><br />To close... the innumerable omissions may irk many a die-hard Harry Potter fan, but don't let that discourage you from going to see Order of the Phoenix.  It's still the best Harry Potter movie to date- it just could have been a little bit longer and, by extension, a little bit better.</p></body></html>

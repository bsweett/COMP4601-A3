<meta name="summary" content="Fall of the Tyrant"></head><body><p>This film looks at Hitler during his last days, when his grasp of reality truly began to slip and Third Reich was overrun. German with English subtitles I felt it probably captured the feel of the times more accurately than Hitler, the Last Ten Days, a movie I also liked. As seen from the point of view of Traudl, Hitler's secretary, the scenes leading to the Hitler's last moments run from the banal to the macabre. The immediate aftermath of the suicide, in which many of Hitler's inner circle began their escape and others also took their lives, is presented during the film. Overall, a great production.</p></body></html>

When you compare this role with Sherlock Holmes and his performance in Tropic Thunder, you'll understand what I mean if you didn't immediately. All three roles are very different, yet he delivered them expertly, and with a combination of real drama and real humor in each of the three.<br /><br />In "Iron Man", he elevates what could have been just another comic book hero movie with his completely engaging performance. Let's face it, even tho I was a comic book fan, and like these movies, their numbers in recent years has approached overkill. The first Spiderman movie was revolutionary, but the next two were nothing more than continuations of the first. The first Hulk movie was wretched, and even tho the second was an improvement, Edward Norton didn't bring the personality to the character that Bill Bixby did in the TV series. The Fantastic Four was interesting but quickly forgotten The X-Men series was a cut above, and so was Iron Man.<br /><br />However, without Downey's performance Iron Man might have tanked as badly as the first Hulk. The story is nothing very surprising, and the "surprise" and ending are nothing but predictable. However, Downey's Tony Stark is alive. When he feels we feel. When he seduces a reporter, its all very natural and predatory. When he has troubles with the suit, his alarm infuses us as does the slapstick of his early mistakes. He is charming, infuriating, and at times completely blind to what is going on around him. All very human.<br /><br />I hold back one star because the story REALLY could have used a lot more imagination. Downey's performance almost hides that flaw ... almost.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

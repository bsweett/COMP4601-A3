I enjoyed this film very much, Hudson plays Caroline, she takes care of ill elders. She arrives at a house in New Orleans and strange things begin to happen to the man she is taking care of. A fantastic and scary performance by Gena Rowlands, who knew she could convel such an evil old lady so well. Watch out for the twist ending, didn't see that one coming. Hudson is great as always, she should do more of these types of films. I highly recommend The Skeleton Key!</p></body></html>

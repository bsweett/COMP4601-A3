The screenplay is all over the place, I mean do you expect to find a voodoo priestess in the south pacific, it's like the writer was just like..why not?  I like everyone else, liked Depps Keith Richards impersonation in the first movie, but it's a one note trick, it's like ok we get it, you're doing Richards.  Frankly, im no fan of Bloom, he just does not responate, he gets lost when he is on screen with Depp or Knightly but I did like many of Sparrows crew, they were very funny at times.  The special effects were excellent, no doubt much money was spent on this film and you can help but be awed by it, but this is without question the weakest of the three movies; it's overlong and short on story, that sound contraditory I know, but there it is..enjoy.</p></body></html>

This film is silly but so much more watchable than his last two films. The acting from Wahlberg is over the top, I have never seen him this loopy and inconsistent. Some of the scenes push the envelope, some work and some don't. This thriller is a mixed bag for me, decide for yourself.</p></body></html>

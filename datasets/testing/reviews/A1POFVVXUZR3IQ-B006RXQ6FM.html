<meta name="summary" content=""May I ask what you're writing, with a ballpoint pen?""></head><body><p>"Doubt" is a highly atmospheric and visually compelling dialogue-driven drama and showcases some of the best performances in a movie. The multi-talented Meryl Streep plays the fearsome Sister Aloysius, Principal of St Nicholas Catholic School, and takes up arms against the kind-hearted and genial Father Flynn [Philip Seymour Hoffman, who astounds with another compelling and credible performance]. Sister Aloysius personifies every stereotype of a Catholic nun one hears about - she is stern, constantly disapproving, and quick to point out the deficiencies in others.She is extremely disapproving of Father Flynn - he uses a ballpoint pen [God forbid!], he takes three lumps of sugar with his tea [ a sign of gluttony], he likes Frosty the Snowman [a pagan character!] and above all, he is too easy-going and tolerant. When young, impressionable, and rather naive Sister James [Amy Adams] finds Father Flynn displaying too much interest in a new kid at school,Donald, who also happens to be the first black kid admitted to a school whose students are primarily Irish or Italian, Sister Aloysius pounces at the opportunity to oust Father Flynn and expose him to be the degenerate she believes him to be. The evidence is purely circumstantial, yet Sister Aloysius is relentless in her efforts to expose Father Flynn, compelling the reluctant Sister James to spy on him.<br /><br />The performances here are top-rate - Philip Seymour Hoffman is credible as the embattled priest with aspersions of doubt cast upon his character. Meryl Streep portrays her role as the almost maniacal Sister Aloysius with assurance and perhaps even glee, and Amy Adams comes into her own as an actress with a finely-nuanced performance as the young nun in a difficult situation. There is also Viola Davis who plays Donald's mother with conviction.<br /><br />The dialogue effectively captures the themes portrayed in this human drama with substance. The dreary atmosphere at the school is effectively captured with the use of muted colors and the score lends a haunting effect to the proceedings.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of the stereotypical roles assigned to Meryl Streep's character as the vindictive nun with an agenda and Amy Adams' overly naive nun. Also Viola Davis' reaction to the situation seemed rather shocking to me as a parent myself.<br /><br />But, flaws aside, "Doubt" certainly is a well-made drama that provides food for thought.</p></body></html>

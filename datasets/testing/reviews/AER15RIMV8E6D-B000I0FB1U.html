<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good!!!"></head><body><p>This movie has been out for 3 years, and today was the first time that I watched it, and I thought it was pretty good and funny. Jack Black stars as Ignacio who works at an orphanage. He soon decides to become a masked luchador in order to make money for the orphans. I'd probably recommend NACHO LIBRE!!!</p></body></html>

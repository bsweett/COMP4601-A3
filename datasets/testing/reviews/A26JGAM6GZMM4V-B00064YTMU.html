What we have in this film is perhaps the best example of Mann's style: Multiple camera angles, leisurely conversations juxtaposed with high-speed action, ethically and/or morally ambiguous lead (usually male) characters, and music which is seamlessly integrated within an unhurried plot. It is twilight in Los Angeles as Max (Jamie Foxx) carefully prepares his cab for another evening. Two fares of note: a prosecuting attorney named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) with whom Max almost immediately develops a mutual attraction and then an-assassin-for-hire named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who retains Max for the entire evening. For the next several hours, Max provides the transportation which Vincent needs to complete a series of five hits for his client, a major drug organization which needs to have four witnesses eliminated. As for the fifth person on the hit list....<br /><br />As I observed the development of the story line, certain elements in it reminded me of the earlier Mann films but also of Chinatown (1974) , Pulp Fiction (1994), and L.A. Confidential (1997). For example, its noir elements; also its engagement of the viewer to feel like an eavesdropper, if not a voyeur. Almost all of Collateral was shot at night and much of the city revealed may be unfamiliar to those who actually live there. Killing people is what Vincent does. I would rank his skills somewhere between those of Edward Fox's "Jackal" and John Travolta's Vincent Vega. It is Foxx (not Cruise), however, who is the film's emotional center of gravity. Mann brilliantly establishes this during Max's conversation with Annie, a cab scene I consider to be at least the equal of Brando and Steiger's in On the Waterfront.<br /><br />Given all that, why not a higher rating? Good question. In fairness to Mann and his associates as well as to those who read this brief commentary, I want to be very careful when answering that question. I don't reveal too much when suggesting that several situations in this film are distractingly implausible. Mann is a master of portraying gritty realism. In this film, he sometimes wanders across the line into areas more appropriate to, for example, The Matrix (1999) or an earlier Cruise film, Minority Report (2002). Also, I found the film's ending unsatisfying. It gave me the impression that Mann really didn't know quite what to do. (I had exactly the same reaction to the ending of Mike Nichols' The Graduate.) Some films conclude with a clear indication that a sequel is probable. In this instance, that would also be implausible.<br /><br />Overall, Collateral provides solid entertainment. Although I enjoyed The Bourne Supremacy somewhat more, that's just one man's opinion.  See both and judge for yourself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OFF AND RUNNING"></head><body><p>Two things are prominent in this fast-paced, gory, adrenaline pumping sequel:  the action is non-stop and the Reaper vampires are some of the ugliest creatures committed to cinema, and impressively real-looking.  Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, the half-vampire/half-man killer who is recruited by a Nosferatu like vampire (played with quiet relish by Thomas Krestchmann) to rid the world of these mutant vampires who are impervious to silver, stakes and garlic; sunlight seems to be their only mortal enemy.  Snipes reunites with Kris Kristofferson and takes on nerdish Norman Reedus to join forces with "normal" vampires to wipe out these deadly new creatures.<br /><br />BLADE 2 moves like a tornado, with dazzling fight sequences, lots of flashy gore, and tremendous atmosphere from director Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy).  Ron Perlman is on hand as a particularly nasty vampire whose cockiness and macho bravado is properly put in its place finally.  And Leonor Valera is beautiful as the vampire Nyssa.  Luke Goss gives fierce delivery to his role as the original Reaper.  There are a few surprises at the end, which gives BLADE 2 a powerful presence as a genre film.</p></body></html>

In particular, the main character never develops a strong relationship with the survivors he encounters.<br />*Not much action.<br />*I can't help but to notice that the mutant zombies look fake.  They're like a cross between "LOTR"'s Gollum and "The Mummy"'s Imhotep.  Thus, they are not very menacing.<br /><br />Unlike its predecessor "Omega Man," this film has much less action, and focuses more on drama, suspense, characters, and themes.  But even if it is slow-moving, the imagery is great, the film is well-made (even if the camera shakes a little), and has some strong, interesting themes and ideas.  It could almost be considered artistic and deep.  I think it surpasses most other monster/zombie/sci-fi movies, and would reccomend at least renting it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better Than The First, But Still Not Good"></head><body><p>Why did this movie get rave reviews?  It was too long, too boring, and DID NOT rewrite the "zombie genre" which so many people claimed it did.  I found the the plot jumpy and inconsistent.  There was no real "feel" of terror.  All that being said, I think the main thing that failed this movie was the outside over-hype.  It was nothing that I expected, because if it had been, then it would have been good.  Sorry, can't recommend this one.  However, it is better than the first.</p></body></html>

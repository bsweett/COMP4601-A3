<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Movie That Became An Icon of Horror"></head><body><p>It may not look like much by today's standards, but for the budget that was used making this movie, it really comes off great. This film is different from the two sequels in a couple of ways, one being that Ash is more of the cowardly co-star and second being that this is strictly horror. Not that it is really scary, but it's intention are in that genre with no real laughs intended. Everytime I watch the movie, I am amazed with how much was able to get done with such a low amount of money to spend and how well the movie comes off. It is just as good as any major film of the same year, you can't really tell the difference between a big budget horror movie and the Evil Dead when it comes to quality.<br /><br />It is easy to tell that there was talent that was working in front of and behind the camera. Not just Bruce (who would be the only star with any future success in film), but everyone else was equally impressive. The way the entire movie was written, set up and shot is nothing short of amazing for a young director and writer (Sam Raimi). Overall, if you have seen any of the other movies in the series or never have, this movie is a big recommendation. Just know that this is different from the other movies, as I said, Ash isn't the heroic icon he is known for now with the quick one liners. He is more of a side kick who accidentally has to survive his friends turning evil.</p></body></html>

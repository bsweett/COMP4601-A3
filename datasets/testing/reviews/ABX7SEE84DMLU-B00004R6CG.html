<meta name="summary" content="You Were a Very Apt Pupil"></head><body><p>The script has James Stewart deliver this line not once but twice near the end of this once-in-a-lifetime movie.<br /><br />The observation underscores a simultaneous strength and weakness of the movie.  How plausible is it that someone could be so overtaken by a "job" of assuming someone else's identity, for money or love, that they would complete that job with such conviction?  However, the movie's acceptance of that plausibility is itself questioned by Stewart's pleading and accusatory statement.<br /><br />"You did such a good job that you convinced me to love the person you became," he says to her in these lines.<br /><br />But the movie's greatest resonance is that we all do this when we fall in love.  Love's noblest outcome is that the lover strives to become everything her partner comes to desire, and can define no other role for herself than the one she has assumed.  "Why couldn't you learn to love just me instead of the person I imitated to gain your love?"<br /><br />The timeless quality of this film is that, in the coldest and seemingly most hopeless terms, Hitchcock tells us, honestly and simply, that romantic love is mutual deception at best and narcissism at worst.<br /><br />If you don't get scared off the tower by an approaching nun, try jumping off...<br /><br />This sounds really depressing, but underneath that is the film's haunting and puzzling final visual image, Stewart is unafraid to look down, and see reality for what it is.  He is cured of his illusions and, nasty as that shock was, he is now healthy.  Hitch's message is that delusions, even romantic delusions, help nobody, and that honesty is much, much better than overadaptive madness.</p></body></html>

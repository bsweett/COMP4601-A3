<meta name="summary" content="I  SAW  SAW"></head><body><p>Now that the mask of SAW's killer has joined up with the masks of SCREAM and HALLOWEEN in our collective unconscious, it's maybe time to take an objective glance at James Wan's movie. I haven't had the time yet to see the two sequels but the original SAW is really excellent. Good actors, which is pretty rare in this kind of production, a smart screenplay that should please amateurs of whodunit and serial killers movies as well as hard-edged horror movies fans and not too many references to previous films or disguised borrowings even if the atmosphere of CUBE and SE7EN is tangible in a few scenes. In short, SAW is a movie not to be missed if you're a movie buff.<br /><br />A DVD zone your library</p></body></html>

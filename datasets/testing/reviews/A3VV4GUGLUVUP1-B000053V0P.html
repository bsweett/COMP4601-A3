<meta name="summary" content="Independence Dumb"></head><body><p>A charismatic Will Smith and a boring, bland Bill Pullman take on world-destroying aliens in this crowd-pleasing, brain-draining disaster flick from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, who'd go on to make the even worse "Godzilla."  More subtle than "Armageddon," and twice as funny as "Mars Attacks," this baby features the largest collection of stereotyped characters since Irwin Allen released "Earthquake" in Sensurround.<br /><p>Honestly, Smith is the best thing about this movie; he proves he has the big-screen presence to carry a film.  Or maybe he comes off so well because all the other characters are papier-mache, or something like that.  Jeff Goldblum plays... well, Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch despoils his formerly decent film career as Goldblum's Jewish Dad (he wouldn't be out of place in a 1930's radio show).  Then there's Harvey Fierstein as the Funny Gay Guy, and Harry Connick, Jr. as the Doomed Best Friend, and Mary McDonnell as the Saintly First Lady.  Factor in Randy Quaid as the comic-relief Crazy Guy and couple of Cute Kids with mooncalf eyes.  Somewhere in there we get strippers, a marital reconciliation, a wedding and a computer virus, plus a lot of heartfelt moments carefully lifted from better movies.  And explosions, explosions, explosions.<br /><p>This is one of those movies where unheralded billions die in spectacular SFX fireballs and CGI imagery, but a dog gets a slow motion leap to safety.  Granted, the effects are sharp and the battle scenes are truly massive.  But as long as the dog survives, why should we care about any of the people?<br /><p>This DVD release features a pristine widescreen print and tons of extras so you can get the full, empty "ID4" experience.  Actually, you might have more fun playing with the special features and just avoiding the movie altogether.  It's big, loud and silly.</p></body></html>

He just had this one slip up and it's called Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.<br /><br />I have stood behind Bay on every one of his previous films including Armageddon and Pearl Harbor which I thought were amazing and have gotten so much criticism. Bay is notorious for putting things in his movies that would never happen in real life and when called out on it he will flat out admit to it. He likes to push the envelope of reality in order to make something look cool. But you can't blame him entirely because he knows his audience better than perhaps any director in Hollywood. You need only to look at the billions of dollars his films have grossed to see that. He knows what Middle America wants to see. Several people have told me that this movie was incredible and that they loved it and that it was better than the first one. I disagree entirely but there are so many people out there that just want to be visually entertained for two plus hours and take away nothing else from the film. I have had people tell me that they like to watch bright and shiny things go bang on the screen. If this is what you are looking for in a film, then Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is for you. Now on with the bashing.<br /><br />The film opened very weak in comparison to Transformers. Optimus Prime's voice seemed dull and not as adventurous as it did when we first met him. Maybe he had already seen the movie when they had him narrate it.<br /><br />I have heard rumors that Bay shot all of the action and CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery) sequences months before there was even a script and then had the writers generate the rest of the story around those scenes. Is it true? Not sure.<br /><br />I've got to tell you however, watching the film it looks like that's exactly what happened. And the writers are all very talented. He brought back the two who wrote the first film as well as another writer who has an incredible list of successful screenplays under his belt to include, Arlington Road and Reindeer Games just to name a few. And the two writers who wrote the first film also wrote the new Star Trek and Mission Impossible III. So you have to ask, how did this film get so horribly screwed up? Where was the witty dialogue and perfect comedic timing that the first film was engulfed with? Where was the cool story and plot and character development scenes? Who knows what happened.<br /><br />I will say that it is filled with awesome action sequences and should undoubtedly win an Oscar for best special effects and at the very least be nominated for Oscars in sound and sound effects editing. But I feel like that's all the film had to offer and I'm sorry but that's just not enough. I don't care if it's just an action movie. It's because I'm such a huge fan of Michael Bay that I'm this disappointed. Luckily he promises to put more effort into the script of the third film.<br /><br />The plot is nearly impossible to explain. It's everywhere all at once. Apparently the Transformers have been here for thousands of years and the leader of the bad guys (Decepticons), called The Fallen, was imprisoned in space. It makes you wonder if they called him The Fallen before he fell or if it's just been so long that perhaps they just forgot his real name. Anyhow, his buddies send Transformers out on missions to gather intelligence from our Military bases that apparently don't have very good security at all. They soon discover that Sam (Shia LaBeouf) has a shard of the cube left from the first film.<br /><br />We learn that Sam is off to college without his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). I am amazed that this girl even made it into Hollywood. Next to Paris Hilton, she has to be the worst actress out there. I understand that she is attractive physically and that nine out of 10 guys would love to sleep with her. So many guys tell me "She's hot dude." So what if she's hot, she's a terrible actress! This is a huge movie and there are plenty of actresses who are 'hot' and can actually act! Hopefully her character will die early in the third film.<br /><br />Sam is talking on the phone with her using very cheesy dialogue that is obviously pushing toward what is going to happen next, when a piece of the cube drops from the pocket of the sweatshirt he was wearing at his first Transformers encounter. He explains that he hasn't washed it because it's his lucky shirt, as lame as that is, thank God Shia LaBeouf is a great actor so it's tolerable. But then he drops the shard of the cube and it burns through the floor and the ceiling of the floor below and lands on a countertop and somehow can't melt through that. Then all of the metallic common household appliances come to life. They transform, so I guess we are supposed to believe that they are Transformers? But the Transformers are aliens so did the Witwickeys purchase all of their appliances from Mars? A huge firefight ensues and Sam is rescued by his Camaro that Transforms into Bumblebee.<br /><br />Immediately following this scene, Sam tells Bumblebee he's leaving him at home because he is no longer in danger. I guess Sam must have suffered amnesia to not remember that he was just attacked by several little Transformers. And what kid in their right mind would leave behind a brand new Camaro, let alone one that's a Transformer?<br /><br />Bay also shows Mikaela sitting on a motorcycle wearing the skimpiest outfit imaginable in a very provocative pose at her father's body shop. Maybe her dad was at lunch when she struck this unnatural pose? We also get to see Mikaela change her outfit to say goodbye to Sam which is really an excuse to just see her change her outfit. And then it isn't shown to us how exactly Mikaela ends up with the shard of the cube and later in the film Sam actually asks her if she has it, but she takes it with her and where does she put it? She brings it to the body shop which is comprised entirely of metal objects and not one of them turns into a Transformer, like Sam's appliances did. How does that add up?<br /><br />This film doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be. At one moment it is filled with vulgarity, intense violence sequences, it shows two male dogs having sex with each other and Sam's mom even samples pot-filled brownies at his college and has some amusing side effects. While I was not offended by any of these moments in the film, I know that several parents were.<br /><br />Then on the other hand, it is filled with all kinds of lame child-related humor as well. A lot of the Transformers are real slap-stick characters like the twins who I found to be annoying in every scene and the little voices that some of them have. A lot of the dialogue by the Transformers is child-like in nature as well. There's even a Transformer that is so old he has a beard made out of metallic shards and uses a piece of his body as a cane to get around. Come on, seriously?<br /><br />He's a great actor, but they used the same guy that played the Colonel in the first film, (Glenn Morshower) to play a Four Star General in this one. He is working with the good Transformers (Auto Bots) in a special military unit. For some reason, despite the fact he is in charge of the project, he is allowed by a Major to speak with Optimus Prime, but can't see him directly. And Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) knows way more about the project than the General. So much in fact that he doesn't feel the need to call the General, Sir when speaking to him and is aware that the President has appointed a new civilian in charge of Commanding the Auto Bots. The General actually says, "I guess I didn't get that memo." I was in the military folks and I'm here to tell you that a Major would damn sure refer to a Four Star General as Sir or General and would have no knowledge of information regarding the President and his chief of Staff that the General would not. Wow.<br /><br />Sam and Mikaela meet up with a really irritating kid who is supposed to be a comic relief that is Sam's roommate in college and the always funny and enjoyable John Turturro's character Simmons. They all set out to gain information from the very old Transformer mentioned previously. They are then transported by him miraculously to the pyramids in Egypt where the secret to their salvation is believed to be and the third act takes place. I glanced at the clock on my DVD player when watching this for the second time and the final action sequence was well over 30 minutes of non-stop action. Given the special effects were amazing and it was very fun to watch, it was just too much. It just kept going and going and going. It was about as relenting as watching a couple of kids play with the Transformers toys for over half an hour.<br /><br />The Decepticons previous to all of this had captured Sam's parents who bring so much to the film. They really are hilarious and believable characters played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White. I guess the Decepticons had kidnapped them in hopes of trapping Sam in Egypt, but then they are just set loose. Maybe the Decepticons forgot about them due to the chaos of the rigorous 30 plus minute climax?<br /><br />There are two huge moments in the film that were beyond the lamest of the lame. It's almost like everyone at the pitch meeting was yelling out ideas and then someone said, "Hey, let's just use all of them!" and then everyone agreed. Not to give too much away, one involves an idea that's been recycled a million times and takes place at Sam's dorm room with a pretty girl. How random was that? Once it's over it's never mentioned again. The second is Sam's destiny that's carried out at the climax. Why did he have to be the one to do this? A toddler could have been just as effective. After all of the other confusing and ridiculous moments in the film though, several of which I didn't even mention, these seem to fit with the rest pretty well.</p></body></html>

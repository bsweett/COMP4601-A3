There's really not much to say about the story, because there really isn't much of one, other than Elektra is resurrected and is soon protecting a man (Goran Visnjic) and his teen daughter from the Hand.  Fans who are familiar with Frank Miller's monumental Daredevil stories, in which he created and introduced Elektra, will be familiar with many of the characters; including Stick (Terrance Stamp), Typhoid Mary (Natissia Malthe), and Kirigi (Will Yun Lee), but those same fans will no doubt be wondering what those Daredevil characters are doing in Elektra.  I expected better from director Rob Bowman (Reign of Fire, the X-Files movie), but he probably didn't have much say in the matter.  All in all, Elektra is worth a look for comic fans, but don't expect anything good from it.</p></body></html>

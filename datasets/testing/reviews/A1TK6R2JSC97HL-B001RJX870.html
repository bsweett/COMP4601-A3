<meta name="summary" content="The Defeat of the Triumph of the Will"></head><body><p>"Downfall" navigates a surprisingly easy path between two untenable extremes in its depiction of the last days of Hitler and the Reich.  Beginning in 1942, Hitler meets Traudl Junge, one of several candidates for the job of being his steno.  Eventually, Traudl will follow the Reich leadership into the Fuhrer bunker and observe the agonizing disintegration of the nation.  Here we meet the monsters both well known and less-so - from Hitler & Goering to men like Krebs, Jodl & Hanna Reitsch.  As the Red Army closes in on Berlin, the Reich leadership barks orders both purposeless and impossible - with non-existent combat units capable only of delaying the inevitable.  Eveyrbody knows what happened next - in high spirits, the occupants of the bunker kick off a suicidal orgy of cyanide capsules and 9mm bullets.  Magda Goebbels, traumatized by the end of Hitler (more than the collapse of the world around the two of them) murders all of her children.  On the surface, in bombed-out Berlin, those who neither fight nor commit suicide, are murdered as Bolshevik collaborators or defeatists.  Eventually, some will escape the Bunker - but must face vigilante Waffen-SS troops ready to kill any who would turn their weapons over to the Russian invaders.  Never far from either the proceedings above or below, is Der Fuhrer himself - as acted by Bruna Ganz, even after he's committed suicide, he still has a presence.<br /><br />"Downfall" takes a third path from those normally used to chart the end of last century's monster.  Making the Nazis into monsters doesn't quite cut it - they were men who had the opportunity not to commit monstrosity, why deny them that one shred of humanity that condemns them the most?  At the same time, humanizing the monster in the context of a 2-hour movie that doesn't begin to chart their atrocities risks downplaying those atrocities.  Instead, "Downfall" measures the evil of the Nazis by depicting the ends they will go to avoid having to face the consequences of their evil.  With their Walther pistols and their cyanide capsules, they gleefully end their lives confident that the rest of us will see valor, and not the shame of defeat, or their fear of years of Soviet captivity.  Ganz, as Hitler, best emphasizes this - by making sure that scenes of him suffering shame, terror and Parkinsons are balanced by scenes of him demonstrating unregenerate fascism to the end: giving orders even he can't believe, making pronouncements right out of Mein Kampf, abandoning his people by committing suicide.  We're led to believe that Hitler's end was marked by his own suffering and that of others, but "Downfall" confirms that he callously ignored the one to inflict the other on those he hated.  The rest of the performances are also nuanced - the script gets us terribly interested in people who - for all we know - will probably blow their brains out at any moment.<br /><br />If the story has one flaw - moral or dramatic - it's the recurring focus on Traudl.  Though obviously loyal to an evil cause, Traudl herself is not really evil, and "Downfall" is willing to make Traudl more a victim than victimizer of that loyalty even if none of us are willing to do the same.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good!!!"></head><body><p>I watched this last night for the 1st time, and I thought it was pretty good! Charles Schine meets Lucinda Harris on a train. It begins as harmless fun, but when he has an affair and takes her to a cheap hotel, they are robbed and Lucinda is raped by a guy named Philippe LaRoche. LaRoche starts blackmailing Charles and threatens to tell his wife, but he can't let that happen. There is a lot of suspense and a little plot twist! I highly recommend DERAILED!!!</p></body></html>

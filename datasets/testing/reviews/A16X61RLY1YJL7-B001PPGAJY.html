<meta name="summary" content="X-2 X-Men United - An exceptional sequel!"></head><body><p>"X2 X-Men United" is, simply put, an exhilarating and exciting follow up to the first movie.  Cartoons and comic books aside, as a theatrical/DVD release, this movie entertains as much or more than the first one.  Yes, many a fan of those cartoons and comic books are reeling from the major differences and those nuances left out of the movies but, just for a minute, take a look at this film and its predecessor from a completely open perspective and you will clearly see that this film has all of the elements that make for a successful action/adventure movie and yes, it does have a plot and that plot is very well thought out.<p>One of the better aspects of this film and the first is that there are elements that were set up in the first film that weren't paid off in that film but are paid off here such as; Wolverine and his mysterious past and Jean Grey's future...  Along with those payoffs, there are some great new character arcs that are set up in this outstanding film.  <p>The entirety of the cast from the first film makes their return in this film and there are some great new additions to the cast of actors/characters.  Long time fans of Star Trek are most assuredly familiar with Patrick Stewart and his exceptional acting abilities and, just as in the first film, it's wonderful to see him on screen with Famke Janssen, who most will recognize as Kamala from one of Star Trek The Next Generation's best episodes.  Ian McKellen, most recently of "The Lord of the Rings" fame makes a return appearance as Magneto and performs to his wonderful standards.  <p>The ever beautiful Rebecca Romijn-Stamos performs brilliantly as Mystique just as Halle Berry does with Storm and I'm sure taking a huge cut in pay.  New to cast and series is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler and his performance is astonishing to say the least.  Hugh Jackman has to be one of the luckiest men in the world when considering how many takes it might've taken when he has Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Halle Berry and Famke Janssen all portraying an attempted seduction of Wolverine...<p>I've never watched any other films that Bryan Singer has directed but with this and the first X-Men movie, one can definitely tell that this director has a long future in directing action films.<p>The Premise:<p>A teleporting mutant makes an attempt on the life of the President, right in the oval office after easily wading through the Secret Service, but he stops short of killing the President and disappears from the White House.  Not long thereafter, we're reintroduced to the X-Men and they're after the teleporting mutant who attempted to take out the President and Wolverine's makes his return.  Unbeknownst to them though, William Stryker, who is played exceptionally well by Brian Cox, is a government agent who has plans to eliminate all of the mutants on the planet...<p>What follows from there is one of the best action/adventure genre movies that I've ever watched.  I would highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films from this genre, whether you're into the comics or not.  I personally have never read them and have followed the characters quite easily as the producers and the director have gone out of their way to ensure that those of us that don't follow the X-Men regularly will have no problem following the film.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Full-Length Commentary with Director Bryan Singer and Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, ASC<p>-Full-Length Commentary with the Writers and Producers<br />-"Nightcrawler Attack" Interactive Multi-Angle Scene Study<br />-"Wolverine/Deathstrike Fight Rehearsal" In-Depth, Behind-the Scenes Exploration<br />-"The Second Uncanny Issue of X-Men" The Ultimate Making-Of Documentary<br />-Extraordinary X2 Featurettes:<br />*"The Secret Origin of X-Men" A Complete Anthology<br />*"Nightcrawler Reborn" The Adventure Before X2<br />*"Introducing the Incredible Nightcrawler" Character Study & More<br />-11 Deleted/Extended Scenes<br />-Still Galleries<br />-Theatrical Trailers</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Legendary"></head><body><p>This remake of Omega Man (staring Charlton Heston), which itself is a remake of  Vincent Price's The Last Man on Earth, is arguably the best of the three.<br /><br />I watched both of the above movies in preparation for viewing I am Legend.  Each is campy and fun, updated for its own time.  I expected the same from this:  another fun zombie movie.  I was quite mistaken.<br /><br />Although not a die hard fan of Will Smith, I am in awe of his stellar performance in this movie.  It is basically a one man show, and Smith hands-down proves he has the talent and screen presence to successfully pull it off.  It is a riveting performance; one in which Smith lives up to his potential as a cinematic leading man.  His emotions are realistic and run the gauntlet:  anger, humor, hope, love, caring, despair, shock, loneliness, fear. He does it all and leaves you believing.<br /><br />The cinematography of a deserted New York is outstanding, both oddly beautiful and action packed.  The opening sequences grab you and glue you to your seat.  The scenes of Smith hunting on the streets of NYC really drive home just how alone he is.<br /><br />The infected, the CGI vampires, actually made my skin crawl.  All the effects were well done, and allowed the viewer to successfully suspend his disbelief.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great film.  It still affected me days after I had seen it.  And that is exactly what a good movie should do.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Believe the hype - this is fantastic @}->---"></head><body><p>I had a feeling that I'd like this movie - I just didn't know how much.  It's really great and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I have known of the musical for years, but living in Australia, it's never come here and I've never seen that.  But whether you look at it as a movie version of the play or just as a stand alone movie, it's brilliant either way.<br /><br />The music is amazing.  All the singing is great.  The costumes and make-up and hair are great and the acting is superb.  Beyonce does a good job, and while Eddie Murphy is great, I almost thought Jamie Foxx was better.  Danny Glover is fantastic, Anika Noni Rose shines but the true brilliant acting does come from Jennifer Hudson.  She deserves the Oscar for sure.  Look out for good cameos like Jaleel White (Urkel) and Loretta Devine.  Sharon Leal (Boston Public) stars as the 'third' member after Effie leaves.<br /><br />The resemblences in the movie to real life are there - there is a group in some scenes who are just like the Jackson 5, and some of the looks that Beyonce had are so similar to Diana Ross.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie highly enough - especially if you love the sounds of Motown and further into disco also.  I cannot wait for this to come to DVD.  I just hope they don't run short on copies because everyone will want to snatch this up as soon as it's released too.  Do yourself a favour and catch this brilliant movie especially while it still might be on on the big screen.  I love it.</p></body></html>

I also went bananas at the chinese influenced seating in Hugh Grant's sitting room - since cured by the superior English upholstered furniture in Julian Fellows' Separate Lies.  Everyone's being cutesy English but I know, it could be a LOT worse so this is a guilty pleasure but at least it is genuinely entertaining (unlike Notting Hill and that I Love Paris movie - I can't remember the latter's name - now those films are really unwatchable.)</p></body></html>

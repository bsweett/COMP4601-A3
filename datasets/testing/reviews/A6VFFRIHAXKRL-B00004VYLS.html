<meta name="summary" content="Before Nolan Burton made a dark Batman mainstream 8.5/10 part 2 on Batman 89 Blu Ray IMPORT reviews"></head><body><p>Batman 1989 Directed by Tim Burton starring Jack Nicholson as The Joker, Micheal Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne Kim Bassinger as Vicky Vale, Billy Dee Willams as Harvey Dent, Pat Hingle as Gordon Jack Palance as Grissom is a timeless classic your story is about Gotham City a crime ridden city the man behind all this is Carl Grissom the leader of the mob. When he learns that his right hand man Jack Naiper is f&uuml;?***g  his girlfriend he sets Jack up. Jack ends up falling into a vat of chemicals but he lives & it turns his hair green his skin white & it makes him even more psycho 1st he kills Grissom & gets control of the mob then eventually we learn that he has poised beauty goods hairspray make up ect ect it is killing people Bruce later learns that Joker when he was Jack Naiper killed his parents. Also Bruce is dating Vicky Vale & The Joker wants her too so of course he has to save her a couple of times. I think the plot with Nicholson's Joker was more like the Joker.

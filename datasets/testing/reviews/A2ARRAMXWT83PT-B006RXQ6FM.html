As soon as the credits roll, scenes from the film tumble around in your mind, causing you to seriously evaluate what you have just seen. You come up with your own interpretation of the events.<br /><br />Directed by John Patrick Shanley from his own play, DOUBT tells the story of an uptight, extremely conservative nun who suspects foul play in the church, when the new priest is suspected of molesting a black student. The nun, Sister Aloysius Beauvier, has good reason to accuse the progressive, somewhat libral priest of the crime. Or does she? That's one of the many questions that the film asks the characters on screen, as well as the audience. Are things REALLY what they seem to be? Or is Sister Aloysius simply out to pick a fight? She doesn't like change. Father Brendan Flynn is all for it, and he constantly tries to break through Aloysius' tough exterior. Times have changed, he says, and so must she. It is no suprise that she takes aim at him the first chance that she gets - but, once again, does she have good reason? Did the priest really molest the boy or not? Is there any reason to doubt that he did? The film presents the argument from both sides, and in my opinion, is very ambiguous in it's conclusion.<br /><br />This film is carried by the dialogue and acting, which is amazing. Meryl Streep, Philip Seymore Hoffman, and Amy Adams give some of the best performances of the year. Amy Adams shines as a young and naive nun who gives Streep reason to question Hoffman.<br /><br />SEE IT! You'll be thinking afterwards!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This retelling of the King Arthur myth is pure entertainment"></head><body><p>Enjoyment of this film depends on expectations.  And so, if you don't care about historical reality or Academy Award winning performances, this latest version of the King Arthur myth is a great couple of hours of pure entertainment.  It's set in the year 405 and tells a rather modern version of a courageous and wise Roman King Arthur, who leads a band of brave knights into a variety of battles.<br /><br />In a short prelude to the main action, the audience learns that these knights have been forced into involuntary servitude as young boys because they come from a tribe of great fighters whose lives the Romans spared because of their bravery.  Their names are familiar - Lancelot, Sir Galahad, Tristan, etc. and they are bonded in the way that men at war bond.  These are the years, however, of the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire, which has Arthur questioning his own loyalty.  After all, his own mother was a Britton, one of the conquered subjects of Rome.  And he's also the kind of king who believes in freedom and justice for all even though its centuries before these concepts became popular.  But no matter, as played by Clive Owen, he sure does look good in his armor, as do all the knights, who seem to be able to move around quite freely in their seemingly restrictive garments.<br /><br />Enter Guinevere played by Keira Knightly, an 18-year old beauty, who is so pretty that she steals every scene she's in.  But this Guinevere, however, is no damsel in distress.  After she is rescued from a torture chamber by the good Arthur, we soon learn that she is a woman to be reckoned with.  Not only does she stand the snow in a low cut gown and shoot arrows at the enemy, she also has another costume which looks like a leather bikini with just a narrow leather strap over her chest to bring out her cleavage.  This is appropriate since she is supposed to be from a matriarchal pagan tribe and for this scene she wears body paint.  In this outfit she carries a sword and fights one-on-one with the Saxon bad guys as their red blood splashes on her in strategic places.<br /><br />I thought the casting was wonderful.  The prelude of the young boys taken away to fight grow up to look pretty much what we would expect them to look like as adults. Lancelot is dark with curly hair for example.  One of the young boys is chubby and he grows up to be a knight called Bors, who is a big lovable giant of man played by Ray Winstone who is cast as the loving father of a dozen children and is seen sometimes holding a baby who looks exactly like him.  I liked the idea that there were no super stars in this production.  This allowed me to see the people as characters, rather than the latest box office draw.<br /><br />The battle scenes were great.  This was because it was possible to follow certain characters which fleshed out the storyline.  Later, the extras on the DVD explained the difficulty of training all the extras to ride horses, fence and generally look authentic.  The main characters' fights were great also, mostly because they really looked like they were fighting, including the exhaustion that must come after a day of heavy swordplay. I applaud the director for this as well as the film editor, because in a film like this there is a lot of footage to choose from and decisions have to be made as to what to leave in and what lands on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />This is not a film that will grip my emotions and put tears in my eyes.  But it certainly did engage my attention.  That's why I recommend it.</p></body></html>

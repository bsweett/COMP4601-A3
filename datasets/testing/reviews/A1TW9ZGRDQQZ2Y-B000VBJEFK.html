<meta name="summary" content="Another gem in Pixar's library"></head><body><p>Although I didn't find Ratatouille as funny as most of the other Pixar films, the story is what sold me. I just loved the way the whole movie came together. Setting it in Paris, France was just a sight to behold. The animation looked great and the characters were memorable.<br /><br />I don't know if Pixar is capable of making a film that critics and audiences dislike. This kind of film really puts Shrek the Third to shame.<br /><br />Now off to the pet store to get my own pet rat.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

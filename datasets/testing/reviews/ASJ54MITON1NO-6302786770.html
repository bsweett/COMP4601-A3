<meta name="summary" content="1967 Leone Western."></head><body><p>This was the best Leone film of the series, starring Clint Eastwood. Most noteable for the look of the film, using close-ups, cut to: master shots, on the wide screen format. It had a European quality to it, even though it was a Western, due to the fact that the director was Italian. In any case, the film although lengthy, is easy to watch, because the story carries the viewer along rather well. I bought a copy of the dvd at a grocery store for $9.99, but disc two, doesn't really interest me, with it's special features. After that, I saw the single disc at Best Buy for only $6.99, which would have been the better deal.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Movie That Changed Everything"></head><body><p>With it Willis became an international star, McTiernan the foremost action director of the age, and it has been infinitely copied. But the movie itself if very original and perhaps the best action film ever made. Why? Unlike most action films, this movie spends lots of time developing its characters and the plot. It creates people we care about. The acting is outstanding. I cannot think of one bad performance in the entire movie. The scene-stealer is Rickman, who gained his stardom from this film (and has been typecast forever as a villain). It does all this while being the most heart-pounding film of the century, and the directing is incredible, by the way. There is substance here, not just style. If you watch it enough times, you will realize the true genius of this production. McClane and Gruber become not only metaphoric of good and evil, but also of the struggle of the human spirit.</p></body></html>

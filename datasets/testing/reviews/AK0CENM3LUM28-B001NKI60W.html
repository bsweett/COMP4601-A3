I went into Mamma Mia not realizing that it was a jukebox musical for ABBA songs, and I left disappointed.<br /><br />Not that there's anything wrong with the songs on here - they're catchy and upbeat, if you like that sort of thing - that is, if you like ABBA. If you're not here for the ABBA songs, though, the musical comes off as flimsy and anemic - with several plot points seemingly out of place, largely in order to lead into another ABBA song. Indeed, without the basic understanding that "Mamma Mia" is a jukebox musical, a lot of songs feel strangely out of place - "Honey, Honey", in particular, seems oddly sensual for a young woman to be fantasizing about her mother's lovers. The setting and timeline, too, are badly muddled - the musical takes place in Greece, but "Mamma Mia!" carries Italian overtones, and "Our Last Summer" wistfully places them in France when, to judge from all other plot points, they weren't. Mama mia, but this is very confusing to a viewer not in the know.<br /><br />If you really like ABBA songs, you may enjoy this musical, but I found the soundtrack to be the strongest feature of this movie. The actual plot itself is very flimsy, and often feels like an excuse to rush to the next song. The acting and singing is superb, and the movie is well-cast, but it's hard to hang a meaningful, compelling plot on a handful of catchy dance songs.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

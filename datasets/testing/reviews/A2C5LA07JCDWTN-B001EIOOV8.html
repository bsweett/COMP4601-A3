<meta name="summary" content="De Niro and Pesci Revisited - A Match Made in Heaven"></head><body><p>Casino was a victim of bad timing. Released within the same five year span as Scorcese's absolute masterpiece Goodfellas, the comparisons were inevitable. Is Casino as good as Goodfellas? Flat out...No. But not many films are. Casino deserved the chance to stand on it's own merits but with De Niro and Pesci seemingly reprising their Goodfellas roles it's difficult for that to happen. Nonetheless, Bobbie D does a bang-up job as Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a professional gambler who is hand-picked to run the Tangiers Casino for a consortium of Mafia bosses from around the country. Pesci plays Nicky Santoro, the Mob's enforcer who comes to Las Vegas for one reason...to take over. As usual the performances are stunning, De Niro and Pesci work together as well as any screen tandem I've ever seen. Sharon Stone does a great job as Ace's two-timing, drug addicted, gold-digging wife. I've always despised her as a person but I have to give credit where credit is due. The more I've watched this film the more hysterical the mob bosses are to me, if this is the way the mob is really run then their in big time trouble. Anyway, as always things start of great but turn out real bad in the end for some people in Casino. It's a long film but worth the ride and a fine addition to any DVD collection.

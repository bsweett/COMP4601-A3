<meta name="summary" content="What a delicious menu of male stars!"></head><body><p>No one's ever been able to rob a Vegas casino, but Daniel Ocean (Clooney) wants to rob three. As the film continues on, you realize his motivation.  The casino's owner, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), stole his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts.)<br /><br />That's all the cast I'm going to mention.  I'd practically wear the caps key off making parenthesis to cover who plays who.<br /><br />The story involves Daniel getting out of jail, hiring his crew, setting up the robbery, executing the robbery, and I won't tell you the rest.<br /><br />"Ocean's Eleven" is almost a runway for it's all-star male ensemble cast. You've got every kind of gorgeous from Clooney's slick, to Brad Pitt's 'Ted Nugent knock-off' chic, to Bash's bold and exotic patter.  You have to suspend disbelief in a lot of places, but it's still nice scenery.</p></body></html>

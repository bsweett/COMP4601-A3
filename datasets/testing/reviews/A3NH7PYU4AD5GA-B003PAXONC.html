<meta name="summary" content="Robinson and girl Friday"></head><body><p>I notice I was in a mellow mood when I watched this movie in a Singapore cinema. I focus entirely on the good sides of this entertaining movie and ignore other aspects.<br />The good sides:<br />Girls get to watch Will Smith a lot (which made my daughters happy, hence me).<br />The variation on Robinson Crusoe is fascinating, even if Friday doesn't make it as long as Crusoe.<br />Optimal use is made of Bob Marley's music.<br />Suspense is very strong in some scenes, mainly the hunt into the dark building (a variation on Silence of the Lambs, with different, though similar monsters).<br />An interesting variation on the 'apocalypse caused by science' theme.<br />A marvellous opening scene with Thompson, happily and modestly admitting that she conquered cancer. One does not need to be anti-science to appreciate this gem.<br />The monsters, well, they were also there, as was the future, in the person of the girl from Sao Paolo who never heard of Bob Marley.</p></body></html>

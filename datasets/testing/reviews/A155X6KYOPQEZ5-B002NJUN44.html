<meta name="summary" content="Didn't follow story line at all"></head><body><p>I think the characters fit pretty well for this movie, but the movie CLEARLY does not compare to the book. The movie does not follow the storyline whatsoever. It's basically on its own. I hope they don't make a sequal for this as it would totally corrupt the story. I don't recommend this movie to any big Inheritance fan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="All I expected of Part 1"></head><body><p>I think director David Yates did as much with the material as could be expected. He got their best performances yet from the three stars, there was a little more humor than in the book (very welcome) and the outdoor locations were imaginative and in some cases majestic. All the vital plot ingredients were there to prepare viewers for the grand finale in part 2. Having said that, I found this an unsatisfying movie just because I wanted to see Part 2 immediately, not in 8 months' time. It's not that I don't know what happens, it's just that the first part of the movie resolves nothing. Once we see Part 2, it will be possible to pass a judgement on the whole. This instalment was good, but rather like trying to rate a meal when all you've had is the appetizer.<br /><br />A warning: as is apparent from other reviews, this movie even more than the others relies on the viewer knowing the story in some detail before watching it. If you are a Harry Potter fan (like me), no problem. If you haven't got a good knowledge of the story so far, either bring yourself up to date with it up to the end of book/movie #6, or don't waste your time watching this one. It won't mean a thing to you.</p></body></html>

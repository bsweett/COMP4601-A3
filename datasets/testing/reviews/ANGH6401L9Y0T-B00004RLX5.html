<meta name="summary" content="The Best of the Original Movie Series"></head><body><p>This one doesn't depend on the situation left by the last episode so much, so I don't think it constitutes a spoiler. So far, this is the best of the series. I had so much fun!<br /><br />For one thing, the captured Klingon ship is the only thing available for the crew of the Enterprise to get home from Vulcan. (Just in case you haven't seen the third one yet, I won't tell you why they were on Vulcan, or how they captured the Klingon ship.) As they approach Earth, they find there is a major crisis going on. There is some alien probe disrupting all energy sources and communications, and the President of the Federation orders them not to dock, because it is too dangerous.<br /><br />Spock really demonstrates some excellent guessing in this one. First, he speculates that the reason the probe is stirring up the oceans is that it is trying to communicate with someone or something which it expects to find in the water. So Kirk asks Uhura to modify the signal it is putting out to how it would sound under the ocean. She does, and it sounds like whales. Specifically, humpback whales. Problem is, they have been extinct for some hundred years or more.<br /><br />So the crew decides their only hope is to go back in time to the "late 20th century" (presumably 1986) to try to find some humpback whales, carry them forward to the time when the alien probe is screwing everything up, and see if they can communicate with the aliens.<br /><br />So a good part of the story is the amusement value of these 23rd century people trying to fake it in a 20th century version of San Francisco -- and Sausalito, where the cetacean research center is where George and Gracie, the humpback whales, reside. In fact, I was living in San Francisco right up until 1986; they were filming in 1985, actually, while I was there.<br /><br />One of the most amusing situations is when Uhura and Chekhov go looking for a nuclear reactor to "steal some protons" (I think it was) at the Alameda Naval Base. Chekhov, with his thick Russian accent, gives the security people some real problems.<br /><br />But the bottom line is they manage to bring the whales back and the whales save the planet. Incidentally, they are no longer extinct, because Gracie is pregnant. Whether whales can repopulate the oceans with just one breeding couple is not discussed; presumably they can get cloned if necessary.<br /><br />I had a great time with this one, played quite a bit more for laughs than the earlier movies.</p></body></html>

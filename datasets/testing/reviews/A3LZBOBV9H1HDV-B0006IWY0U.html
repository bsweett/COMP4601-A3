<meta name="summary" content="Master And Commander is one of this year's best, Brilliant!"></head><body><p>"Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" is one of this year's best, it is brilliant. Russell Crowe plays Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, in one of his best performances of his career, Captain of HMS Surprise. Paul Bettany plays Dr. Stephen Maturin, Surgeon on the HMS Surprise, in the best performance of his career, so far. HMS Surprise is attacked in the beginning of the movie by the Acheron, a much stronger and faster battleship. Some of Aubrey's men were wounded and some of them died. As the movie progresses, we get to learn how the characters are feel and we feel the same exact thing that the characters because of the fact is that we know and get how they feel. Aubrey gets surprised twice by the captain of the Acheron and vows there will not be a third time. Men are lost in the balance of the attack and chase to find the Acheron. Men that were good people and fought for their country very well. At the end of this movie, they set a trap on the Acheron so they won't be the ones that are surprised and this trap does work brilliantly to Aubrey's advantage. This movie is set during the era of the French Revolution, and it is quite brilliant how Peter Weir and his crew made "Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" come to life so brilliantly. The acting is superb as the performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany's were. The directing by Peter Weir is brilliant and superb at its finest hour. The screenplay by Weir and John Conlee is excellent without compromise. The visual effects by INDUSTRIAL LIGHT & MAGIC & ASYLUM is brilliant without compromise. The costume design is dynamic and brilliant. The production design is wonderful and brilliant. The film editing is great. The cinematography (Oscar Winner) is superb and dynamic without compromise. The music is brilliant and excellent. I like this movie very much, because it was brilliantly different from the movies we have seen this year, because it doesn't go for swashbuckling at all. The Acheron is the shark from "Jaws". It hides and it waits for its attack to happened. This movie should get brilliant Oscar and Golden Globe coverage when the Oscar Nominations and Golden Globe Nominations are announced in the next two months or so. See this movie now or any time you can see it. You will enjoy it very much. Also won for Best Sound Editing.</p></body></html>

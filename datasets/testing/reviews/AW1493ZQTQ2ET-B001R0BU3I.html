<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing"></head><body><p>This movie deals with terrorism and counterterrorism.  The movie is very well crafted, with acting, characters, plot, scenery, special effects, etc. which all come together without any significant flaws.  I felt like I was watching real events and I was engrossed.<br /><br />The messages implicit (and sometimes fairly explicit) in the movie are that good guys aren't all good, bad guys aren't all bad, we often can't sort out the good and bad guys, and innocent people are routinely caught in the crossfire (tragically, sometimes en masse).  To solve the problem, we need to address its root causes, since this back and forth exchange of blows won't resolve anything and may well escalate the problem.  Don't we all want a world in which our children and grandchildren don't have to worry about these kinds of dangers?<br /><br />I'm giving this movie 5 stars because it does its job well, and I don't see any reason to deduct a star.  I recommend the movie to anyone interested in looking at a realistic portrayal of this sad conflict.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Call the cops!  Julianne Moore got robbed!!!"></head><body><p>I almost skipped this movie during its theatrical run because the trailer for it was such a jumbled mess.  It left me confused about what kind of movie it would be.  But after it made so many Top Ten lists (not the David Letterman kind) I had to see it, and BOY WAS IT GREAT!!!!!  Complex, noir-ish, well-acted, well-written...  Fantastic on every level.  An intelligent, action-packed, suspenseful nail-biter.  Here's the one problem, though:  Between seeing it twice in the theaters and numerous time at home on DVD, I'm left wondering if there is a cut of it I haven't seen yet.  For some inexplicable reason, Kim Basinger won Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars for this movie.  I've watched this movie a number of times and I cannot recall, even when I was deliberatly watching for it, ANYTHING that she did in this movie to warrant a nomination, to say nothing of a win.  Julianne Moore in BOOGIE NIGHTS that year -- now THERE was an Oscar-caliber performance!  But I didn't see anything in Basinger's role or performance that merited that kind of achievement award.  Maybe I have a "bad pressing" of the DVD.  Maybe there are scenes missing that everyone else has seen except me.  Yeah, right.  Can anyone out there help me on this?  Basinger's felony theft aside, this DVD packs a lot of punch for your purchasing dollar -- a great film, interesting commentary and behind-the-scenes stuff, and a "virtual tour" of the Hollywood of old.<br />I hope Julianne Moore filed a police report the night that Basinger won the Oscar, because Moore was ROBBED in broad daylight!</p></body></html>

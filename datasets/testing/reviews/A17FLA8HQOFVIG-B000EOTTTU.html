Pleasant romantic story though."></head><body><p>This 2005 film tells the story of Captain John Smith who came to America in the 16th Century and the curiosity and conflict between the Indians and the settlers. That's a familiar theme and this film does it well.  Colin Farrell is cast as Smith.  He's portrayed as a dashing and handsome bad boy adventurer.  Naturally he and the Indian have problems with each other and the Indians want to kill him.  It is the Chief's daughter who saves his life and she is then cast out of her tribe.  This is the legendary Pocahontas although that name is never used in the film.  This part is played by 14-year old Q'orianka Kilcher.  She is the daughter of a South American Indian father and a Caucasian Swiss mother and grew up in Germany.  She is indeed very pretty but she really doesn't look like the Native Americans we see around today.  Again, Hollywood casting wants to cast mixed race beauties because they think it will sell more films.<br /><br />Naturally there are hints of a love affair between the Indian maiden and the Captain, especially now that she is forced to live in the English settlement and learn English ways.  She has to wear a corset and tight shoes and learn to read the bible.  However, she takes it all in stride because she loves the Captain.  However, he leaves for another adventure and tells everyone to tell her he is dead.  She mourns for a long time but eventually is romanced by a young widower played by Christopher Bale.  They marry, have children and seem very happy.  Years pass.  Then this couple and their children are invited to England where it is inevitable that they meet up with Captain John Smith again.<br /><br />This is not a film for history buffs.  I just can't believe that things happened the way they were depicted in the film.  It was basically a romance with an interesting setting.  I knew that before I started to watch the film which I did just for pure entertainment.  The acting was good, especially that of the young woman.  But the film was basically a time-waster.  I gained no insights.  I felt no emotions.  And I didn't believe the history.  I therefore give "The New World" a very mild lukewarm recommendation if you discover on TV some night.  It's just not worth the effort of renting it though.</p></body></html>

His quality deserved him the Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay for 1994.  The movie combines three different stories that brilliantly connect one another by editing.  John Travolta makes a triumphant comeback, making this his best performance since &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.  Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and he are well-deserving of their Oscar nominations for their acting roles.  The Travolta and Thurman dance club scene is unforgettable.  Thurman's next scene is when she shines more than anywhere else(can't say how).<p>It may have to be watched a second time to fall in love with &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  After that, it's addictive.  However, the only complaint is that one may have &quot;Girl, You'll Be a Woman&quot; stuck in their head for a couple days.  This movie will be a classic for years to come.</p></body></html>

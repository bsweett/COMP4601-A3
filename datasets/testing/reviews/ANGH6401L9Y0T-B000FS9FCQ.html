I'm glad I finally saw it.<br /><br />I didn't catch exactly when this story takes place, but I recall the date 2035 being mentioned, so it was at least that far in the future. Much of the world is in chaos, but England is under the iron control of a theocracy. An unlikely hero emerges who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and a black cape, and all black clothes.<br /><br />He calls himself V (Hugo Weaving), and we know of him primarily through the eyes of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman who becomes involved with him in an unusual way.<br /><br />Everything about this story is unusual, although there are clearly elements reminiscent of other stories, both movies and books. The flavor of 1984 is in it, as well as The Count of Monte Christo, Phantom of the Opera, The Wall, and Zorro at least; you may well discover others. It was a graphic novel (i.e., comic book) before it became a movie.<br /><br />I can tell you almost nothing about it without spoiling some of the best surprises. I saw elements of esoteric initiation traditions, radical theories of mind control, political science, mass communication, and more. If it helps to understand what I'm talking about, let me just say that you may want to play it often enough to grab some of the best quotes. Or perhaps I'll look for the graphic novel.<br /><br />A movie that will live forever as a cult classic.</p></body></html>

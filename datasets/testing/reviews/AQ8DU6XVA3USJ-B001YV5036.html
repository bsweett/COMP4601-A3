<meta name="summary" content="Once Again, Crowe Proves He's the Best"></head><body><p>Russell Crowe is magnificent as boxer Jim Braddock, in a multi-layered performance that shows he is perhaps the most versatile and brilliant actor alive. Braddock's true-life story is one of a comeback in 1934, from the pit of destitution during the great depression, and much more; it is about uncompromising ideals, the love of a husband for his strong and devoted wife, and never giving up, despite incredible odds. The supporting cast is also terrific, with Ren&eacute;e Zellwegger wonderful as Mae Braddock, and Paul Giamatti outstanding as Braddock's manager, Joe Gould. Among others in the cast that shine are Craig Bierko as champion boxer Max Baer, Paddy Considine as Braddock's friend Mike, and Rosemarie DeWitt, who plays Mike's wife Sara, and is Braddock's real-life granddaughter.<br /><br />Masterfully directed by Ron Howard, this is a film with substance, a rarity considering Hollywood's recent output, and a joy to view repeatedly. The cinematography by Salvatore Totino is remarkable, capturing the look of the era with what looks like natural lighting, and the fight scenes are astounding. Adding to the beauty of this film is the score by Thomas Newman, and I especially like the music during the 15th round of the Braddock/Baer fight. The disappointing box office take in its theatrical release must have been devastating to those who worked so hard on "Cinderella Man," but this film is sure to become a classic, and known as one of the finest boxing films ever made, thanks to its excellent DVD package.<br /><br />The DVD has loads of extras, including 3 separate commentaries, by Howard, and writers Akiva Goldsman and Cliff Hollingsworth. Of special interest are the "Deleted Scenes," with the extraordinary "splint scene," as well as archival footage of the Braddock/Baer fight, and other interviews, film clips and stills of the Braddock family and those relevant to the story. "Cinderella Man" is 144 minutes of superb filmmaking, with a performance by Crowe that is unforgettable, and a fabulous 2-sided DVD package that makes it a purchase one won't regret.</p></body></html>

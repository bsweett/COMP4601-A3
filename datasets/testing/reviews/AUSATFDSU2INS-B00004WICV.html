<meta name="summary" content="A green corridor of miracles"></head><body><p>Based on a Stephen King novel, in 1994 was released a film called The Shawshank Redemption, adapted and directed by Frank Darabont. With a moderate success and forceful critic praise, The Shawshank Redemption conquered seven Oscar nominations.<br /><br />The script was pure dynamite. Darabont was able with The Shawshank Redemption - as never before did other films based on novels of King -, to transmit an emotional force that was impossible to resist. The secret was staying faithful to the original manuscript, preserving the essence of history. Summarizing, Darabont knew how to expose why like so much Stephen King novels.<br /><br />Because they are stories well told.<br /><br />It's true; they are not Shakespeare, Cervantes or Balzac. They are not intricate philosophical paradigms or moral dilemmas that make us reflect on the questions that life holds. They simply are books that captivate us because they entertain us in a pleasant way. They are frank, gripping and sure, they make us laugh or cry.<br /><br />Now, Darabont returns with his adaptation of The Green Mile, a work that, as The Shawshank Redemption, is extraordinarily faithful to the original manuscript.<br /><br />In 182 minutes, the director condensed a history that takes place in a southern prison, in the years after the Great Depression.<br /><br />In Louisiana, Cold Mountain penitentiary has a block that receives inmates sentenced to death penalty. A linoleum corridor separates two rows of cells, where criminals rest next to their guards, waiting a crucial of their lives: death in the electrical chair. That cell block is called the "green mile", in a metaphor to the color of the floor tiles where those men walk to a destiny served by justice.<br /><br />Year after year, Paul Edgecomb and his guards observe the men that come to their final stroll by the mile, guilty, innocents, and sometimes lunatic, other indifferent ones. But nothing Edgecomb had lived until then could prepare him for a black man of formidable contexture called John Coffey, guilty of the death and violation of two local children.<br /><br />Coffey intrigues Edgecomb and his guards, because in spite of his size, he behaves like a ingenuous boy, with smooth voice and afraid of the dark. For Edgecomb it's practically impossible to think that Coffey has committed a crime. Much more when he sees him practice miracles as generous as his good heart. Therefore, when the time comes to execute Coffey, Edgecomb is not able to walk that last stroll by the green mile.<br /><br />Three hours free of cynicism, filled with good moments, extremely emotional situations where sentimentality and manipulation abound, where the mysticism is viable until becoming a reality. It is impossible not to be seduced by this beauty. If you can leave at home your cynicism detector, you will enjoy this film enormously.<br /><br />The whole cast offers wonderful interpretations, from Tom Hanks like the comprehensive Edgecomb to Michael Clarke Duncan like the enigmatic Coffey. Magnificent also are Doug Hutchinson like the ruthless Percy Whitmore, David Morse, in the comprehensive and faithful role of Brutal, Bonnie Hunt, the sweet wife, Michael Jeter, the French conquered by a little mouse and Patricia Clarkson, the special lady who can in John Coffey's eyes what's in his soul.<br /><br />Darabont, obviously, doesn't have limits directing. In slow motion, he doesn't know when he has said enough, when he has unfolded too many miracles, when a horrible execution has lasted so long that the audience has to turn around their heads from that much horror. He sweetens what's already been sweetened; he magnifies events, dazzling us with his seduction tactics. He is the master of emotional impact, because he believes blindly in his power.<br /><br />The Green Mile is a memorable piece, although it doesn't reach the levels of excellence reached by its predecessor, The Shawshank Redemption. This last film has a plot more prone to the massive acceptance: its purpose is to raise the triumph of the life. The Green Mile is darker: the subject, ultimately, is death.<br /><br />And as they say, one cannot exist without the other.</p></body></html>

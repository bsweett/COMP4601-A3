I could hardly see anything without adjusting the TV set! Then things get washed out. It's like chasing a black cat on a moonless night with sunglasses on. I did see the occasional color change, and when the image got brighter, things began to get better. The action was good, pretty much non-stop. It's a good addition to the franchise, but better care has to be taken with it's production. This film could have made a better rating, except for the darkness. It's nice to be able to see what it is you're reviewing! Four stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An obvious satire with great special effects"></head><body><p>Posed as a pseudo-documentary, this 09 sci-fi makes some very heavy-handed comments on what happens when minorities must live oppressed by uncaring majorities. The aliens are the weak ones here, and their human oppressors try to relocate them into distant camps like American Indians or WW2 Japanese Americans. Despite the social commentary, this plays quite entertainingly, and is actually a very funny film as we watch the narrator slowly turn into an alien. Lots of violence.</p></body></html>

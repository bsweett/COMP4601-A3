Check his other reviews; he gave the BIBLE one star, for goodness' sakes.  What an idiot.<br /><br />Well, "Galaxy Quest" ain't holy writ but it's not schlock either.  While it also ain't "Citizen Kane" or "Lord Of the Rings," it's a fun and sometimes clever takeoff on "Star Trek" with a few former inside jokes that will be familiar enough to almost anyone by now, but there's plenty of twists on the old themes to keep any reasonable audience interested.  It takes the simple idea of, "What if the bickering cast of 'Trek' actually found themselves in a 'Trek' plot in real life?" and builds on it to the terminally unbelievable conclusion of a plot with so many holes you could fly a few space shuttles through it, but hey, suspending disbelief isn't what this kind of flick is about anyway.  It's a hoot.  Invite some friends over, fluff up some corn, and fire it up with my best wishes.</p></body></html>

Every once in a while there is a sequel that acheives one of those feats. 'Dead Man's Chest' is one of those rare films. It isn't necessarily better than the first film, but it's every bit as good. And that's really good. Our favorite cast of characters return as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan(Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley)are imprisoned and set for death for letting Captain Jack Sparrow escape. Will cuts a deal with a man to find Jack and bring back his compass. Meanwhile, Jack is battling the evil Davey Jones(insert "Daydream Beliver" joke here), a sea creature pirate Jack owes a debt too. Then the race is on to find Davey Jones' heart, buried in a chest, and destroy it. The plot and main focus here get shuffled in all the action and great set pieces. And what great set pieces they are. Director Gore Verbinski has crafted one amazing looking film. The cinematography is sharp and sparkling, and his eye for detail is amazing. The action scenes raise the bar from the first film, including a water wheel fight that is nothing short of brilliant, and a giant sea monster destroying the Black Pearl that has some of the best effects I have seen. The film itself is a bit darker in tone than the first, is a tad bit more violent and may be a bit more terrifying for younger viewers. But the spirit and the humor is still there in full bloom. If there is one problem, it's that the film seems to go on forever. This usually doesn't bother me, but even I felt like it would never end. It's about the same length as Superman Returns, and that didn't bother me. As for the ending, it's jaw dropping superb. It's not a cheat and will not upset you. It's perfect. It will make you want to see part 3 even more. It's like a "Star Wars" cliffhanger, which makes sense since this movie is like the "Empire Strikes Back" of the Pirate movies. Bravo!. The score is wonderful as well. Hans Zimmer does another great job to make the music lift the already rousing scenes and action moments to even greater heights. But really, this is Johnny's movie. Captain Jack has lost nothing. He has another classic and memorable entrance in this one as he did in the first. I can't say enough about it. There has just never been a character, or a performance, like Depp's. He's a genius. Bloom is steady, but his parts are the least interesting. Knightley is breathtakingly beautiful, but she doesn't really serve the script much. Jack Davenport returns as Norrington, and Jonathan Pryce has another small role as Governor Swan. The sea creatures are unbelieveably designed and acted out. Bill Nighy, as Davey Jones, does wonders with the role. You haven't seen anything like this villain before. I loved "Superman Returns" to death, but this is the movie to see this summer. It's the perfect summer movie. What big summer blockbusters were made for. But see Supes's big return as well. I for one cannot wait until next May. Spider-Man 3?. Nah. Pirates 3 all the way. Yo ho ho!.</p></body></html>

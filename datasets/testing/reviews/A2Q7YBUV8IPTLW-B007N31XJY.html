<meta name="summary" content="My vote for best actress and director this year"></head><body><p>If not necessarily Best Picture.  <p>First I have to state that there is probably no one who is less of a Julia Roberts fan than I.  Her acting talents to me have always seemed pretty run of the mill.  And she can occasionally appear to be stunningly beautiful at most times she appears remarkably average.  So i've never understood the hype<p>We are treated here to an extraordinary performance.  She brings genuine honesty to the role.  I would highly recommend that you read the review of 'RESOLUTE' which I found to be particularly poignant and accurate.  To RESOLUTE: I wish that you would include your email and that you would write more reviews because you really seem to know your stuff ie: Independence Day<p>What I enjoyed most about this film is that the story and the performances carried the day rather than production tricks and hype.  In short the movie is very low key.  It's understated in it's visuals and drama.  The viewer is not forced to like or dislike (the character) Erin Brockavich although she is certainly a sympathetic presence as are Albert Finney and the victims of the dumping.<p>In short I did not expect to like this film and viewed it with reluctance but was treated to a real gem of a film and all involved are to be commended.  It's got all of the elements a great story, well acted, enough laughs and plenty of drama plus ultimately vindication.<p>Bravo!</p></body></html>

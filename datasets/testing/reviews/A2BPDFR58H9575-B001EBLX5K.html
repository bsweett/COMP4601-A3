<meta name="summary" content="Disappointed..."></head><body><p>A lot of people love the movie including respected critics and Larry David who laughed so hard that he was afraid to have a heart attack. One of my IMDb friends who is known as an ironic and rather sarcastic critic, called "Borat" a brilliant satire. I don't know - maybe I just don't get the brilliance. I did laugh couple of times but mostly I was disgusted - it is not that brave or outrageous and as a movie it has next to none redeeming values. It hang somewhere in the middle and became simply boring which is the worst crime for a comedy and even with the running time only 84 minutes, "Borat" more than overstayed its welcome. Baron played it safe - it does not take too much courage right now to criticize Bush or to make Jewish jokes or to make fun of the poor uneducated village people. No matter what message he (Baron or Borat) is putting in/out there, the movie is sophomoric and the grandest case of the Emperor with No Clothes (in more way than one) I've witnessed. It is forgettable and mediocre at its best.</p></body></html>

Juila Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman make a great and complete cast together. A lot of dirty talk but no sex scenes are shown, never shows the middle of relationships, just the beginning of when they meet and the end of their relationships. The ending was a surprise, didn't see that one coming. Closer is a beatiful and complicated film for anyone who has ever been in love with more than one person.</p></body></html>

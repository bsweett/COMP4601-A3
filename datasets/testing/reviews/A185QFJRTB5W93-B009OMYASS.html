After that point, it is a quagmire of useless, non-relevent, sex-scenes and expressions of drug use.  After trudging through the first half of the movie, dealing with unrelated mentionings about the female anatomy, one hopes the movie will reach a higher standard and show the horror that was promised.  The only horror here, is the filmaking itself.  While the premise behind the movie is an interesting idea, the filmaker seemed too busy with style over imagery and symbolism over substance.  The film never scares the viewer.  It even falls short of being anything disturbing.  A true waste.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The murders compete with one another for grossness"></head><body><p>In this sequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; Anthony Hopkins is still Hannibal Lecter.  He has escaped and is living in a dark and decadent Italy.  People use cell phones and computers but the theme is the same.  Only now there are many more murders, each competing with each other for grossness.  Hopkins' performance is good, but this is not a surprise.  He has been so typecast as a villain that it doesn't seem like he's acting.<p>Julianne Moore plays Clarice Starling.  Alas, she is no actress.  Her performance is wooden.  But then again the writing didn't create much sympathy for her character.  Ray Liotta is also in this film, over-playing his role as a manipulative FBI chief.  Ridley Scott did a good job of directing.  There was constant action and the scenes all contained the shock value which was intended.  Good cinematography too.<p>All that said, my feelings about this movie can be summed up in one word:  &quot;YUCK&quot;.  It was mildly interesting to me just to see how far a film can go to shock audiences.  I sure couldn't fall asleep in this one.  But unless you, like me, are just curious, I'd recommend you avoid this one.</p></body></html>

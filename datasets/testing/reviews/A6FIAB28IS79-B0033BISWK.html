<meta name="summary" content="Diverting, clever action spectacle but no WMD."></head><body><p>I recall film critic Andrew Sarris giving a lecture about the revolutionary nature of "Night of the Living Dead," produced for mere thousands with amateur actors and a single "premise" rather than a plot.  More importantly, it started out, practically from the first frame, with terrifying shots, scaring the wits out of spectators, and seemingly going from one higher climax to another with no ultimate climax in sight.<br /><br />But excise the "action" scenes from "Living Dead," and all that's left is a lot of dead time and empty space, with nothing of consequence happening on the screen or in the viewer's mind. But not to worry. The sequels reduced the down time, with Romero taking the premise to ridiculous extremes, providing non-stop violent action from the very first frame and with little if any let-up. Then came the "Evil Dead" series of Bruce Campbell-Sam Raimi, which somehow managed to go even further with the continuum of violence and suspense, so much so that, like the later "Living Dead" films, the so-called suspense becomes so outrageous that the line between horror and humor is frequently blurred if not obliterated.  But such campiness is apparently the last thing some fans of "District 9" want to hear.  Even "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," a political thriller if there ever was one, would no doubt be preferred by those who see "District 9" as remarkably sui generis, non-intertextual, beyond comparison. There is no shortage of formulaic movies that "District 9" can be compared with, though one has to agree that "Psycho" or "Vertigo" isn't one of them.  The transformations of Norman and of Madeleine amount to highly disturbing moments of self-descovery to the spectator who has identified with either character, so totally that the experience is unshakeable yet unavoidable: without their metamorphoses into the hidden "other" persona of each, the movies and their spectators would both be incomplete.<br /><br />A second viewing reinforces the conclusion that  Bomkamp deserves to be applauded for producing one of the fine films of the past 5-6 years.  He's a daredevil, a movie lover, and apparently a thinker.  Yet if risk deserves any awards, "There Will Be Blood" is the sort of film one doesn't expect to see produced any more.  There will always be audiences of all ages for "District 9"'s, but you could never say the same for Hitchcock's "Vertigo," Altman's "Nashville," and Anderson's epic film of national self-scrutiny.  They demand analysis and interpretation; "District 9" plays O.K. without it.<br /><br />What intrigues about the film is its ability to hold the audience' attention.  How can a roller-coaster thrill-ride be constantly engaging without pacing, without the moment of anticipation as the cart rises pending its precipitous free fall and screams?  In this film suspense and horror are largely subordinate to violence, action, revulsion (much of it reminding me of the popular medical "freak shows" on cable TV), and confusion (the contending parties at times become almost too many for the viewer to keep track of--which works to keep the viewer slightly off balance, as if in a tense, vertiginous state).  To suggest, as some reviewers have, that all of the engrossing action has an intricate or even broad allegorical meaning that will be apparent to the majority of viewers is merely to invite incredulity among those of us who do not find such science fiction spectacles to be all that profound, mind-altering, or even provocative.  (Kubrick invited interpretation--in fact, required serious reflection of the viewer of "2001: Space Odyssey" for the film to accumulate the power of serious literature.  David Lynch accomplished the improbable: making us love as a brother a fellow specimen who, alongside an elephant, is by far the greater alien; and in "Blue Velvet" he constructs a narrative positioning the viewer to choose between judging what he's seen as pornography or as an exceptionally graphic, modern version of "Young Goodman Brown."  The viewers I can find who have seen "District 9," on the other hand, seem to remember little about the film in particular but recommend it in general as "wild," "over-the-top" entertainment and inventive, resourceful film-making--which still places it short of significant art or, for that matter, fascinating storytelling let alone in-depth character study.<br /><br />The film is capable of holding the spectator's interest thanks to the rapid editing, mix of film stock, shaky hand-held camera shots, and construction of the prawn-like, insect-like aliens.  Like the "Living Dead" films and the cold war thrillers (from "Body Snatchers," "Manchurian Candidate," etc.) the potential for political allegory is there but, even less than the Romero films' portrayal of the paranoia incited in the conservative establishment by the flower-child revolt of the '60s--later revealed as a new "consumer power"), it fails to deliver on this promise.  80% of the film's dialogue is made up of a single 4-letter word, which is not sufficient to give the spectator a picture of an intolerant or totalitarian state.  To the viewer who makes the effort, the film brings out the degree to which, even as we put forth the appearance of humanitarianism and equal rights, we alienate ourselves through greed, self-interest, and a narrow, selfish pride.  The result is that we eventually become aliens ourselves, as the film's last shot so memorably discloses, allowing us room to interpret which of two creatures is the greater alien.<br /><br />Creditably, even in Wikus' transformation into the apparent alien, we sense some room for sympathy for this creature of metal, steel, and electronic circuitry.  And unlike so many of his cousins in other sci-fi dystopias, he has not been victimized by technology.  Nor is the film's antagonist the evil state, bureaucracy, dictatorship, or governing institutions: it's rather the sin of Adam, as old as the very first texts and no less "original."  Just as "District 9"'s protagonist becomes alienated from his garden, he, unlike Kafka's diminished and vitiated insect hero, retains the power to make his own garden.  Moreover, he has been given reason to "believe"--the source being not some "other" creature but his own "sweetie" son--with a promise of deliverance in 3 years' time.  Insufficient, perhaps, in Biblical terms but no doubt a torturous delay for those anxious for the sequel.</p></body></html>

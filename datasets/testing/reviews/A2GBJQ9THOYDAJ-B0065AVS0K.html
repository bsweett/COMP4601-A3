<meta name="summary" content="My name's Nixon. I'm a tax collector."></head><body><p>This is an uncompromising and equally graphic adaptation (Rodriguez called it a "translation") of Frank Miller's series of vivid graphic novels, filled with thoroughly noir images and over-the-top comic book dialogue (some of which reminded me of HEAVY METAL in the old days), shot mostly in black-and-white with color overlays where they serve a purpose (i.e., Junior and blood in general, except when the blood is white). The story lines used were "The Hard Goodbye," "The Big Fat Kill," and "That Yellow Bastard,"as well as the short piece "The Customer is Always Right" -- and the story titles all appear in the dialogue. Mickey Rourke is almost unrecognizable as the bloody-minded warrior-god Marv, Clive Owen is terrific as the good-guy-bad-guy Dwight, Elijah Wood is downright creepy as the cannibal-ninja Kevin, and Bernicio Del Toro makes a good Jackie Boy, especially as the dead body version. Bruce Willis does a very good job playing a Bruce Willis character, in this case a vengeful cop. Jessica Alba is always extremely watchable, though her acting this time isn't very impressive. (The only one they missed getting for this film, who really belonged in it, was Christopher Walken.) And Rodriguez is obviously a major fan of Miller's work. There's also a lot of Tarantino-esque recursion in the plot line (not to mention that the character of Miho is straight out the Crazy-88 in _Kill Bill_, and so are her weapons), reminiscent of _Pulp Fiction_: The beginning isn't necessarily the beginning, nor is the end the end. Of course, there's a _Sin City 2_ coming, and then _Sin City 3_. I'm pleased to say this is a film your parents (or, in my case, my wife) will hate, with no redeeming social values whatever.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NOT BAD FOR ENTERTAINMENT BUT----"></head><body><p>Stiller and Wilson upheld their parts as did Vince Vaughn - Bateman and Snoop Dogg - the story had some comidic parts but it was just slightly above average.<br /><br />Still not bad for entertainment - the gals were beautiful - the guys were into their parts - the car was great despite its dents - loved the end where the two originals showed up.<br /><br />Huggy Bear had quite a range of wild duds.<br /><br />Not a classic but it will do.  Recommend but share.</p></body></html>

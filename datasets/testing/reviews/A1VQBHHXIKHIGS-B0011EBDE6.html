Fortunately, this isn't one of them.  Instead, it's a movie where India is a backdrop to be ignored, aside from one totally unnecessary subplot about sex that could not happen.<br /><br />Rather, this is an observant and very watchable film about three brothers who set out on a "spiritual journey" in which they never get out of themselves long enough to notice anything else.  Good chemistry, great acting, sharp writing, and a fine movie.</p></body></html>

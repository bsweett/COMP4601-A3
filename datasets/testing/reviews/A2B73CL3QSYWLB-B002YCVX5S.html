<meta name="summary" content="Quentin's Anecdote To Hallmark's 25 Days of Christmas"></head><body><p>I have been a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino since "Reservoir Dogs".  That said I was heartily disappointed with his previous grindhouse experiment.  I saw this effort in the cinema and though I liked it I wasn't overly enthusiastic.  My excuse was that I found the constant switch from English to foreign language with subtitles jarring.  Some films, however, deserve a second viewing.  Not since "L.A. Confidential" and "The Sixth Sense" over ten years ago have I reversed my initial opinion of a film.  What I think these film's share are deeply layered scripts that contain alot of subtleties that if you're not alert you miss things.  This is a very ambitious effort by Tarantino.  I won't say he has matured as a filmmaker because he's always been one of our more talented auteurs but this is a progression.  In a nutshell I would describe it as a war film that seems to be a homage to Sergio Leone informed by a film geek's sensibility.  It's a true original even though Tarantino's influences would be apparent to the most astute viewer.  The film is anchored by two brilliant performances one by Brad Pitt as the commando leader and Christoph Waltz as a Gestapo officer.  If Waltz doesn't take home Oscar gold for his work here something's seriously wrong.  In the past I was hesitant to recommend some of Tarantino's work, usually for his penchant for extreme violence and language, and even though this film is harsh at times I wouldn't have as an extreme reservation.</p></body></html>

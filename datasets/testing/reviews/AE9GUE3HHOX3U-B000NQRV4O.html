<meta name="summary" content="European Jerry Springer"></head><body><p>Towards the end of the film I was expecting someone, (anyone)! to go completely mad and commit a violent act in blind rage.  There was so much penned up rage throughout the entire film I thought that at least one of the neurotic characters would find themselves commiting a felony assault or at least end up on the slab.  "Closer" built itself up to be a "thriller" type movie but ended up trying to pass itself off as an edgy, thought provocing chick flick.  I was hoping one of them would, well you know, end up on the slab because in reality they all deserved it.  All four of them were creepy pretentious losers and were just askin' for it.  The film did have me goin' for a while but when it ended, I felt like I was the one being cheated on.  Not to say getting revenge and violence is the answer, but it's a movie and that's what I wanted to see.  Out of the four of them you really didn't know who, at certain points was going to suffer royaly for....(gasp).........adultery!!!!  Who hasn't had their heart broken? How dramatic.  It would have been more dramatic if at least one of them got thrown off a balcony at least.  They should have capitalized on the mystery aspect and surprised everyone.  Out of the four I really think they shoud have killed off Clive Owen's character, he was so annoying.  There were so many angles to this film that could have been exploited, but they chose to be moralistic and give it a happy feel good ending.  It's like the final thought on Jerry Springer, no one cares!!! GO-TO-OPRAH-GO-TO-OPRAH.</p></body></html>

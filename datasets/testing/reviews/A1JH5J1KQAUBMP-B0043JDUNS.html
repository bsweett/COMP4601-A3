<meta name="summary" content="Improves on the original"></head><body><p>Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), AKA Iron Man, is targeted by Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist with a hunger for vengeance and a talent for designing powerful energy whips, and Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a venal munitions manufacturer who covets Stark's fame and success.<br /><br />It has become almost obligatory for everyone to say that this film is not as good as the first, but I liked it more.  Director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux incorporated a large number of elements from the Marvel Universe (Iron Man, Whiplash, Nick Fury and SHIELD, the Black Widow, Justin Hammer, War Machine) but made it all pull together in a coherent narrative.  This bodes well for the upcoming Avengers film, which Favreau will help produce.  The motif of the basically good but also weak man within the invulnerable suit of armor is used to good effect, but even the more weighty aspects of the film are handled with a light touch that keeps it hugely entertaining.  Also, character is not sacrificed for the sake of spectacle.  There may not be as much action as some might wish, but when it comes it really lets loose and the context gives it real stakes.</p></body></html>

If you show your co-workers up, you could end up eliminated--either transferred or fired.  That's what PC Nicholas Angel found out.  When he got 9 Commendations in one year, the London officials promoted him and sent him to a model village, Sandford, where there hadn't been a murder in years.<br /><br />Angel quickly discovered Sandford was too good to be true.  His predecessor probably found out the same thing--but he went loony.  Angel, with the help of his cop-movie loving partner, Danny, decides to clean up the town instead.<br /><br />I laughed so hard at points my sides hurt, but there were also a couple of places where I felt a little ill.  "Hot Fuzz" poked fun at just about every US police film notion. The puns flew and sometimes so did the blood and gore.<br /><br />What _wasn't_ funny was how possible murder could be passed off as an accident in a small town.  It's been 4 hours and I'm still shaking.</p></body></html>

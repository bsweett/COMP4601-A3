<meta name="summary" content="Way Better than "Incredible!!!""></head><body><p>The Incredible Hulk. The title itself is great. Just to start things off. Edward Nortan stars in this sci-fi film about how a man always has something inside him. Something that has a bad temper. Something thats INCREDIBLE. I won't give away much as some of you don't want to hear any major spoilers. I will go by each disc and break down the major things contained on it.<br /><br />DISC 1<br />-The film The Incredible Hulk. As with all dvds it has language, subtitles, and all of that stuff.<br />DISC 2<br />-This is the ultimate disc!!! On this disc are 17 deleted scenes! That alone is fantastic. Then is has the making of the Incredible Hulk, how they filmed some of the battle scenes from the movie, an alternate opening to the movie, and oh soooo much more I cannot remember because I have a friend borrowing it right now!<br />DISC 3<br />-The digital copy to the film. Even as we speak I have the movie right o my mac computer! And also on a video iPod! Digital copys are becoming very popular. And they are also very handy as if you have someone borrowing the movie (as in my case) you can watch it on your computer! The digital copy is a must. And the quality is very nice too, I might add.<br /><br />Now lets move on to the effects. I cannot explain how amazing the special effects are in this movie. The hulk himself looks more realistic than ever before. I have never seen the 2003 version, but I can imagine this version is A LOT better! The movie has almost no "bad scenes" in it. When the back of the dvd says "brief suggestive content" they aren't kidding about "brief". The suggestive content lasts for about 15 seconds and then the movie continues. It does have a PG-13 rating for a reason, though. If you buy this movie, be prepared for violence. There is really not much blood as such. Its just how many people are killed that makes the violence level go up. So don't be fooled by that. Overall, this movie is great and I definitely recommend this to you!!!</p></body></html>

While things seem fine at first, it becomes apparent that this become a story of the wrong place at the wrong time. In the interest of not spoiling the story, suffice it to say that the movie is not what it appears to be, at least ostensibly. That being said, the movie does begin to take a dark, brutal, and morbid shape by movie's end.<br /><br />In a sense, the movie attempts to provide some light misdirection as to what the audience is seeing at first, albeit quite weakly, with a trio of friends engaging upon an adventurous trip out in the middle of a deserted Australian location. A sense of desolation, isolation and desertedness becomes apparent to the audience, and the viewer is able to understand that if something happens to a person in this type of place, the prevailing thought will be, who's going to know or do anything about it? The desolate setting is a precursor of things to come in this movie and sets the tone for the despondency and dejection the protagonists will eventually experience in this deserted part of the country.<br /><br />"Wolf Creek" delves into the horror of becoming captive of someone who is not what he appears to be, someone who is cruel, evil and hateful, but appears to be nice, helpful and a good ole boy at first...this is effective in showing the audience that people are not always what they appear to be.<br /><br />The protagonists or supposedly good characters in this movie ultimately experience the feeling of being powerless to control their own life while being subject to the disgusting and bestial pleasures of a maniacal killer out in the middle of nowhere and there is no one to help them. Imagine being unconscious and waking up confined in an unfamiliar location without the friends you were with originally and not knowing of their whereabouts or their well-being. Imagine hearing or observed the pure suffering of one of those friends at the hands of someone you thought was going to help you. These are the ideas of horror that "Wolf Creek" utilizes quite effectively by putting the viewer in the position of the characters which is certainly realistic and terrifying with the character's individual situation in and of itself.<br /><br />The acting is average at best in "Wolf Creek". John Jarret does an OUTSTANDING job (and really makes the movie good) as the villain; Jarret is clever at showing that monsters do not always appears to be monsters at first but appear just like everyday normal people, and he certainly does well for the Australian theme and setting. However, the protagonists (even if they are ordinary) are somewhat poorly casted and they are not very good actors, and that does bring the movie down a bit in my opinion because the protagonists are difficult to sympathize with except for the dark haired girl who did a decent job I guess, and their inept acting ability as a whole is a direct result of the audience's inability to sympathize with such characters. Aside from that, these protagonists are just a unlikeable lot, and difficult to relate to--at least for my generation.  But, perhaps that's just it, a generation gap...alas, I digress.<br /><br />Certainly, "Wolf Creek" breaks all of the horror movie rules so you never know what to expect, and this is most definitely a good thing. However, "Wolf Creek" fails to do enough with the horror that it initially creates. The setting is good, but once the viewer realizes the situation, the action that follows is completely overshadowed by the setting and situational horror used so well to set things up. In other words, the movie begins to go downhill in the subsequent action...the acting is definitely lacking, and as I alluded to above, the protagonist characters are rather difficult to sympathize with and they don't do a very good job of portraying the character's human reactions and emotions to such an ordeal.<br /><br />The cat and mouse game that follows has its moments but is rather poorly done overall and lacking in substance and in style. Perhaps the style and mood or lack thereof is where the movie suffers the most.  However, for its faults, "Wolf Creek" does a decent job of sneaking up on you, and then it is BAMM right in your face. Clearly, "Wolf Creek" is weak on atmosphere and stylistic elements of cinematic horror, but "Wolf Creek" is definitely a good horror movie for today's standards, but one of the main problems with that statement is that today's horror movies have no standards.<br /><br />Relative to classic horror movies of yesteryear and some of the greatest horror movies of all-time, "Wolf Creek" clearly fails to measure up, but "Wolf Creek" is still a good situational horror film representative of new age horror at its very best, possesses its own charm and survives on its own merit as a horror movie that attempts to attack a basic fear that we all have as individuals, that of being in helpless in an unfamiliar area with no one to help you and completely at the mercy (or lack thereof) of a maniacal and sadistic killer. That's pretty real folks, and "Wolf Creek" does a decent job of bringing this home to the audience. "Wolf Creek" earns almost THREE STARS on my grading scale, but I'm feeling like Santa Claus today, so keep that in mind when reading this review.<br /><br />As a final note, "Wolf Creek" is supposed to be based (probably very loosely) on the true story of a brutal and sadistic killer in Australia some years ago. I saw a supposedly real picture of this killer online after looking this story up, and the way he looked in real life made John Jarret look like Santa Claus. Also, personally, I should point out that I found the ending of "Wolf Creek" to be a bit anticlimactic and disappointing, and this has noting to do with the dark nature of the ending but more to do with the ending and climax being overshadowed by the increasing action and initial setting of the situational horror that is employed so well in "Wolf Creek".</p></body></html>

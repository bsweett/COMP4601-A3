If you're heart is still beating from being chased through a garden maze, you definitely won't need a difibulator any time soon. I don't think I have jumped that much in all my years of exercising! Jack Nicholson knows how to play the insane like no one else! Whew! Excellent movie if you like being scared out of your wits!</p></body></html>

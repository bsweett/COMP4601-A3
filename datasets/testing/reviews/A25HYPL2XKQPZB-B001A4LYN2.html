<meta name="summary" content="This movie was made to win awards, not to be entertaining"></head><body><p>THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a perfect example of the disconnect of Hollywood and its version of a "good" movie and what the American public will pay to go see. This movie was nominated for several awards, including best picture, and Daniel Day Lewis picked up the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Plainview is an oil man. He's an independant oil man and very persuasive at getting land owners to let him drill on their land. Plainview gets word of a town that has tons of oil, and he heads there with his young son. Plainview convinces the town to let him drill on their land, and promises new roads and schools and much wealth for the people.<br /><br />This movie is all about Daniel Plainview, his son, and the person he truly is. As the movie progresses, Daniel Plainview doesn't change, he just reveals what kind of person he is. The movie is based on the novel OIL, by socialist Upton Sinclair, yet the movie contains no political message against big oil or big business. Plainview's primary adversary in the movie is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a pastor of a small church in the town. While the church's beliefs are anything but mainstream, the movie has really nothing to say about religion.<br /><br />This is a movie made in Hollywood for Hollywood. I'll admit I enjoyed Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview. In the film, Plainview looked exactly like a 1980s Tom Selleck. I also enjoyed the scenery and early 20th centurey setting. For the first twenty minutes of the movie, there is no dialogue. This is very unrealistic and shows that the filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson is trying to take the viewers out of the movie and notice the director.<br /><br />This is a well made movie with a good performance by Lewis. But it is also an overlong character study of a despicable man. I can see why this movie won awards, and I can also see why it was a box office failure. (According to Box Office Mojo, ranked 66th in 2007, just behind WATER HORSE: LEGEND OF THE DEEP.)</p></body></html>

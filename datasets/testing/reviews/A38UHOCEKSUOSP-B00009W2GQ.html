A direct continuation from Reloaded, Revolutions is once again more eye candy than anything else, with the actual Matrix getting less screen time than the first 2 films.  The focus is on the great war in Zion city, against the machines.  Its true, the best action and story in this movie all take place in the real world.  But there is still plenty of Matrix involved, but only in the beginning and end of the film.<br /><br />The ending is predictable, but the journey to reach the conclusion has smaller twists and turns along the way that are unexpected.  The movie is very intense, in terms of action and cgi.  It is truly a thrill ride and we finally get to see an army of mechs unleash their firepower upon the sentinels in Zion city.  Neo and Smith face off in their final battle.  Unlike the first Matrix, which incorporated a nice blend of realistic martial arts and wirework, this battle is more cgi and expands to the 2 barely fighting on any ground, thus limiting the true martial arts.  Not a bad fight, but its ridiculously overdone and not very pretty.<br /><br />Some say this movie is just plain bad, but I don't believe that is true.  Most people want to compare it to the first Matrix, but independently its not a bad movie.  While it is not nearly as good as the first Matrix, it is still a great movie, but just like Reloaded, the story effort is not as strong as the first Matrix, and the focus seems to be on the action.  You'll want to see Reloaded before Revolutions, simply because Reloaded is part 1 and Revolutions is pt2.</p></body></html>

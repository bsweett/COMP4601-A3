<meta name="summary" content="Very boring"></head><body><p>This movie begins like so many other horror/thriller movies.  In this case, a woman in the midst of divorce and custody proceedings is moving into a new place with her daughter.  The daughter is apprehensive about the move and the mother reassures her that everything will work out.  We wait for something scary to happen...<br /><br />The building/setting is indeed spooky, but nothing eventful happens for quite some time.  There are many boring stretches in the film that may not be able to hold your attention.  I honestly gave this movie a chance, but it simply wasn't scary or all that suspenseful.  It reminded me of "The Ring", but without the good story and lure.<br /><br />There is plenty of bonus material on the DVD, but it's barely even worth watching people speak with such ferver about a movie that falls so short.</p></body></html>

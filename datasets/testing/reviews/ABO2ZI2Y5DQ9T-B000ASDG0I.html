<meta name="summary" content="Love Me or Kill Me: Nice Actors and Very Dull Script about Marital Quarrel between Professional Killers"></head><body><p>The brief opening scenes are reminiscent of one romantic comedy. Probably you know the film. The scene is similar to the delightful conversations by the married couples talking directly to the camera about their marraiage. Yes, it's `When Harry Met Sally.' In `Mr. & Mrs. Smith,' however, we see how the husband and wife rekindle their love by trying to kill one another.<br /><br />[IT'S JUST A COMEDY] Maybe you have heard many times that `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is an action film. It is true that there are several (perhaps one too many) explosions and a few shoot-outs, and one car chase sequence, but few of them are intended as hair-raising thrills. Director Doug Liman has an explicit goal of making the entire film not too serious about itself, even though the two central characters, married couple of professional assassins, attempt to kill each other after knowing the truths about their spouses.<br /><br />`Mr. & Mrs. Smith' looks like curious mixture of `Prizzi's Honor' and `The War of the Roses.' This Angelina Jolie/Brad Pitt film is sexier than those two films, but it has no darker tone of the former film, and less farcical touch of the latter.<br /><br />Now I am not complaining. `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' has often disarmingly charming characters Mr. and Mrs. Smith played by Pitt and Jolie, and Mr. Smith's co-worker Vince Vaughn. I believe Angelina Jolie is still looking for a better script to do, and Pitt is just being Pitt himself - nice guy, really down-to-earth - but he doesn't need to explore the darker side as in `12 Monkeys.' I for one much prefer him in this film though he is not going to get Ocsar nomination for this role.<br /><br />The script is terribly empty (after so many re-writes) and the weak ending of the final take obviously shows the traces of cutting and re-editing. But there is palpable chemistry enough between Jolie and Pitt, and amusing set-pieces to keep the audiences from getting bored. I mean, almost enough.</p></body></html>

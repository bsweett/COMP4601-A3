<meta name="summary" content="WOW!!  What a movie!!"></head><body><p>The original film was not to my liking.  This film is much, much better.  The difference is there is more character development.  You know and care about who they are.  Technically, this film is a masterpiece.  The is a culmination of Director Sam Raimi's career.  This has all the elements of movies he previously directed.  If you have a surround sound system, crank it up!  The sound is worth the price of the DVD.  The acclaims are justified.  This is probably the best comic book movie of all time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Low budget horror that delivers"></head><body><p>Friday The 13th (1980) rides on the coattails of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978).  Carpenter's movie inspired Friday The 13th and so many other horror movies where suddenly a holiday or special occasion is no longer safe, such as Silent Night Deadly Night, April Fools Day, New Years Evil, My Bloody Valentine, Prom Night, Happy Birthday To Me, and on and on and on.  Of course, Halloween was inspired by such movies as Psycho and Black Christmas, so credit is due there.  As much as Friday The 13th took inspiration from Halloween, it also helped inspire other movie makers to make these previously mentioned knockoffs beginning in the early 1980s.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />What else can be said about Friday The 13th?  It's a low budget slasher horror movie that features one of the iconic monsters in horror movie franchise history - Jason Voorhees (well, at least at the end of the movie).  Michael Myers was the trailblazer, of course, then Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger followed.  Camp Crystal Lake is being re-opened more than 20 years after some unsolved murders took place.  Can a bunch of horny teenagers survive the terror that unfolds?  Watch to find out.<br /><br />This movie stars Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Mark Nelson, Jeannine Taylor, Kevin Bacon, Ari Lehman, and Robbi Morgan.<br /><br />Overall, even though this movie borrows from Halloween, it's a good horror movie to watch and does a good job of providing some scares, and that's the bottom line.  I recommend it.</p></body></html>

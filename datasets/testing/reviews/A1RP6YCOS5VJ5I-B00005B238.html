There is so much that was cut out on the TV censored version that is still left in the uncensored rated R version.<br /><br />Alien successfully mixed the horror genre with the sci-fi genre, and Predator has accomplished an amazing thing as well, Predator successfully mixed the action genre with the sci-fi genre. And what better way to do that than to get one of the greatest action heroes of all time, good old Ahnold. And what better person to do the special affects for a movie than the legend himself Stan Winston, and they got both. And mix it with a great story and add John McTiernan (the dude who directed Die Hard) as director, you have one awesome flick. That's what this movie is.<br /><br />The special effects are top notch in this film; Stan really out did himself with this film. Outstanding work on the dead bodies and all of the mutilation that the Predator, aka the Yatja, did.<br /><br />The musical score for the movie was fantastic as well. Every time I think of this movie, I think about the song.<br /><br />Last but not least, a lot of the credit has to go to Kevin Peter Hall who portrayed the Predator in this film. He made the character come to life, and his battles with Arnold were terrific. He really does make you forget that this is all fake and begin to think that this is real. He was a very talented actor who will be missed.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is my favorite sci-fi movie. It has it all with some to spare. I actually understood what was going on when I watched the DVD. On the censored TV version, they cut so much out you just don't know what's really happening. I recommend the DVD big time, very much worth getting. I guess there was 20 minutes that were cut in the censored version after watch this uncensored version. Get it!</p></body></html>

This film is a movie unlike no other.  It is not an all out horror film, not a all out drama, and not even an all out comedy, it's just &quot;Jaws.&quot; A fair adaption from Peter Benchley's terrifying best seller, Jaws was the first of the summer blockbusters, earning $100,000,000 at the box office.  Okay, the effects may not be Lord of the Rings worth, but let's face it, it was 1973.  Other movies previously before Jaws delivered the shock horror value without brilliant effects (example: The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) The film is definately a cinematic classic, with a eye-popping opening, and a edge of your seat ending.  See this film!</p></body></html>

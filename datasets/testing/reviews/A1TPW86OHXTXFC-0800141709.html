Johnson was in the White House, the Republicans were grooming Goldwater, both sides took the Cold War with grim solemnity, and the world was learning to be comfortable with the term "nuclear deterrent." Roger Ebert<br /><br />I purchased the 40th Anniversary CD and this is my third or forth viewing, but "Dr. Strangelove" seems fresh and undated - an irreverant satire. The willingness of the Director to follow the film to its conclusion - nuclear annihilation -  has that special touch  Its black and white photography is in particular important for its portrayal.<br /><br />General Ripper orders the B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. When the British military attache, Peter Sellers, tries to stop him, Ripper explains the plot to "taint our water supply and deplete our "precious bodily fluids."  He won't even discuss the re-call code. Eventually, he realizes he will be caught and he ends his game. Events on the Army Base are mixed with the War Room in the Pentagon. President Muffley learns from Dr Strangelove and the Doomsday Machine. It appears that neither the Doomsday Machine nor one of the U.S. bombers can be turned from their missions.<br /><br />"The movie's screenplay, by Terry Southern turn this scenario into a dark comedy of errors, illuminated by flashes of brilliant satire. Some of the dialogue has entered the language - "precious bodily fluids," of course, and also the way the dim-witted Col. Bat Guano (Keenan Wynn) hints darkly of Commie "preverts." The scene at the telephone booth between Guano and the British attache, who does not have the correct small change to call the White House and save the world, is one of the movie's best-constructed gags." Roger Ebert<br /><br />The acting in this film is superb, in fact it would be very difficult to top this crew. Sterling Hayden is the epitome of a paranoiac Gen. Ripper.  George C. Scott, however, steals the movie and is brilliant as, Gen. Buck Turgidson, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And Peter Sellers, as President, as Dr Strangelove and RAF Group Captain Mandrake h portrays the epitome of humor, satire and acting. Maj. "King" Kong (Slim Pickens), is perfect in the role of the pilot. His exit from the movie, riding a bomb like a bronco, remains one of the most famous moments in modern film, and is my favorite scene from the movie.<br /><br />"When you consider the history of motion pictures, certain watershed films leap to min. Without a doubt, one of those is Stanley Kubrik's 1964 masterpiece, Dr. Strangelove. As political satire, few movies -- even those as incisive as the hilariously vicious 1992 release Bob Roberts -- come close to this level of accomplishment. In the case of Dr. Strangelove, the barbs and quips (both subtle and obvious) hold up as well today as they did thirty years ago." Bosley Crowther<br /><br />This film shows that it is possible to laugh and to laugh continuously at a shocker of a film that is filled with satire.  It is only when Slim Pickens is riding the bomb do we realizae that this could be real. There But For The Grace Of God, Go We.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-0507<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0RR62">2001 - A Space Odyssey [HD DVD</a>]<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HVI8GU">A Clockwork Orange</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056WRD">Being There</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVS2">Patton</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Z4OXS">Blazing Saddles (30th Anniversary Special Edition)</a></p></body></html>

I hate his nickname, "Pinhead," which suggest minimal intelligence and a gullible nature.  He has neither.  Rather, he is a General of Demons!  Now for the film.  This movie does have flaws: a dated feel and look which is all the more obvious when looking at the style of clothes and haircuts these actors donned; the most repellent flaw here are some cheesy special effects that end the movie on a campy note.  These flaws are altogether unfortunate because the ideas here are fantastic and gruesome. In particular, I was extremely disappointed when this film did not recieve an Oscar nomination for Best Makeup.  Only a year before this film came out, "The Fly" won the Oscar for Best Makeup for similarly grotesque and realistic creations.  Clive Barker brings his book "The Hellbound Heart" to the screen with surprising effectiveness, using religious imagery that is absent from the novella, and motivating all of the actors here to not treat this like a B-movie; and the dialogue here is a vast improvement over that in the novella.  The best acting performance comes from Claire Higgins who practically carries this film showing great range of emotion from lust to absolute horror in a state of intense believability.  Hers is my personal favorite performance here, but by no means is it the only notable one.  There are two Franks.  The Frank who longs for new experiences, "pain and pleasure...indivisible," and Frank the Monster who is the personification of evil: selfish, scheming, and murderously manipulative.  Both actors shine.  As for Ashley Laurence, this is her first film; and while she overacts occasionally, she also has many impressive moments of genuine emotion.  I've seen this film a dozen times, at least, and at no time in any of the "Hellraiser" films that followed this one do the Cenobites look and feel this malevolent.  However, it is not uncommon to find fans of the series favoring "Hellbound: Hellraiser 2" over the original.  I prefer the first one because the acting is better, the story is more eerie and reminiscent of the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, the dialogue is sharper than the novella, and there is a sense of inspired "we've got nothing to lose" ambience from everyone involved in every scene.  This DVD also has THX surround sound which is a huge improvement over my previous EP VHS tape.  This DVD is easy to recommend.</p></body></html>

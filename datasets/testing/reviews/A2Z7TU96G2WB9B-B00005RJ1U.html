<meta name="summary" content="A bit maddening"></head><body><p>Just knowing that there is a sequel to this movie led me to want to see this movie.  After watching it, the reason is obvious.  The first movie answers little to nothing.  If anything, this movie was one big question mark.<br /><br />Without going into detail of the story, suffice it to say that the main characters, the police, the psychic, and we the viewers have no idea what the creature is.  For horror aficionados, the creature is well done and scary.  Ideas of demons and or animal hybrids may come to mind.  Unfortunately for us, the movie never goes into detail.  The attempt of the creature to appear somewhat human is thrilling.<br /><br />The main characters are a brother and sister traveling home from college.  Part of their discussion, as well as their trip to begin with, border on urban legend.  The siblings argue back and forth as only siblings can, but these actors do almost too good a job.  Before too long into the movie, I found myself completely siding with one and losing my temper with the other.  (Who hasn't yelled at the TV?)  Although this seems to detract for the story, the emotional response added to the movie experience for me.<br /><br />Although I haven't seen the next one, I would hope that it answers the questions raised in this one.  Given that, I would recommend not watching this unless you are going to be watching the sequel soon afterwards</p></body></html>

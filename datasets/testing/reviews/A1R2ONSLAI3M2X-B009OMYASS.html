<meta name="summary" content="Somewhat Disappointed......."></head><body><p>I just finished watching Hostel. Being a horror movie fan and having heard alot about this movie, I couldn't wait to watch it. I was somewhat disappointed because the first half of the movie was quite boring and pornish. Now, the second half of the movie I have to say was Cool.  Cool gore scenes although I heard the movie was much sicker and gorier than it really was. Kind of a Chainsaw Massacre and Saw ripoff. I would have expected better from Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth. I'm not sure if there was a "rated" version of the film. I bought the Unrated version. If the rated version was cut down, then I'm sure it would have gotten a 2 star rating from me. If the whole movie would have been like the 2nd half, it would have been a great and cool horror film....... but, I'd suggest horror fans renting it and forward to the 2nd half of the movie!!</p></body></html>

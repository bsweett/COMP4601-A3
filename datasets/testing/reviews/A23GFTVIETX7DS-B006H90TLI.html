<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing, philosophical, oddly beautiful at times: a unique thriller (5- stars)"></head><body><p>Through sweeping cinematography, excellent dialogue, and distinctive characters, this tale of a man hunted by a sociopath transcends its plot.  In the western plains, towns, and cities, a sociopath, Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is in pursuit of a large sum of cash from a drug deal.  Unfortunately for retired welder Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who finds the cash, Chigurh will stop at nothing to get it.  The small town sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones), who puts together what has happened, wants to get to Llewelyn, and a tracker (Woody Harrelson) hired by a drug lord wants to get to the money, all before the ruthless Chirgurh does,  The result is a tense, violent chase at the speed of small town life.<br /><br />The dialogue is so reminiscent of the Coen brothers' much earlier "Fargo" that it is surprising that much of it derives from a novel by a different writer, although the melding of Coens with Cormac McCarthy makes perfect sense.  In particular, the sheriff's exchanges with his deputy (Garrett Dillahunt) and his wife (played with down-to-earth confidence by Tess Harper)  give this film its greater context and rhythm as evil is treated with both matter-of-fact acceptance and disbelief.  Philosophy is doled out in brief parcels punctuated by pauses.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones has played this kind of character so many times that it is remarkable that he makes each one unique.  with its frighteningly  is pure evil, though even he lives by a set of rules, as ruthless as those are.  Brolin delivers a fine, sympathetic portrait of Llewelyn Moss.  And Bardem is simply terrifying with his monotone delivery and largely blank expression.<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" is about the unexpected ways evil enters the lives of ordinary people, and the toll it takes on those who try to stop it.  Because of the tension throughout, this theme is not clear until the last moments, in an ending that at first seems out-of-place and rushed (the last a valid critique.) Although much of the violence takes place off-screen, you can never tell when it won't, and that gives the impression of a bloody-and-gore film.  I find this to be one of the best Coen brother films, although it took several days of thinking about it afterward to realize it.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="4.5 Stars"></head><body><p>This was one of the best sequals I have ever seen to a movie especially in this movie category horror/thriller<br /><br />Saw 2 delevirs I did not see this in the theaters I just waited till it came out to buy then I just flat out bought it and I do not regret the purchase it was well worth the money<br /><br />This movie gives some great twists and interacts a little with the first movie I wont spoil anything with details<br /><br />I give this 4.5 stars because at the end their is a little bit of a corny twist to the movie other than that the movie is great the story is pretty good and the acting is not bad at all this is defenitly recommended to people who saw saw 1</p></body></html>

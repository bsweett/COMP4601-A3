<meta name="summary" content="A Genuine Masterpiece. Not Only for Martial Arts Fans."></head><body><p>I came to "Hero" expecting to see a critically acclaimed martial arts film. My attitude toward martial arts films might best be described as indifferent. I like some of them, but I'm not an enthusiastic fan. I only had to see the first few minutes of "Hero" to know that it was something special, though. The art direction and cinematography are so striking in the opening scene that I consciously thought that this film would be worth watching whether or not the story, characters, or fight sequences interested me. By the first sword fight, I was entranced by the film's beauty. When I saw the red and orange hues that followed, I thought "Hero" might be the most beautiful motion picture I have ever seen. And that was only the beginning. Director Zhang Yimou is one of the best directors in the world today...at making emotionally incisive, understated dramas. "Hero" is Zhang's first action film and, I think, his masterpiece. His characteristic depth and social insight are combined with the energy, history, and flexibility of the martial arts genre in "Hero". The result is larger than life story and characters in a film of uncommon beauty. Zhang has said that the audience will remember the images of "Hero" even if we forget the story. To say that he is right would be understating "Hero"'s visual impact. This may be the most beautiful film ever made, thanks in no small part to cinematography by Christopher Doyle and art direction by Huo Ting Xiao.<br /><br />"Hero" is a fable that takes place two millennia ago, during the era of warring states just before China was unified under its first Emperor. Qin is one of China's 7 states, and its King's sole ambition is to unite China under one rule. The Qin army's constant attacks on the 6 other kingdoms have made the King many enemies, however. Three assassins from Zhao have harassed the King for a decade, and he has promised riches and an audience to whomever defeats them. The reward is claimed by a Nameless (Jet Li) prefect, who arrives at the Court for his audience with the King. The King asks Nameless how he defeated the 3 great assassins: Sky, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword. So Nameless begins to tell the story of his battle with Sky (Donnie Yen), who visited his district, and his clever manipulation of Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) at the calligraphy school where they both studied.<br /><br />Many of "Hero"'s scenes have prominent color elements -red, blue, white, or green- depending on who is telling the story and why. The cinematography has to be seen to be believed. The fight sequences were choreographed by Hong Kong action director Tony Ching Siu-Tung. And martial arts fans will be pleased to see Jet Li and Donnie Yen reunited onscreen. The sword fighting sequences don't propel the story, however. They are well-integrated with the narrative and character development. And like everything else in "Hero", they are absolutely beautiful. You don't have to care for action or martial arts movies to enjoy "Hero". This is just a great film by any standard. 2000's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" was the first Asian film to find a wide American audience. Its US box office was more than twice that of "Hero". I attribute that to hype. "Crouching Tiger" is a good genre film, but "Hero" is far superior. If you liked "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", you'll love "Hero". If you were underwhelmed by  "Crouching Tiger", you'll be overwhelmed by this film. Congratulations to Zhang Yimou for making a masterpiece that will be praised for generations. Don't be put off if you don't normally like martial arts movies. This is a sweeping drama that is punctuated by action. See "Hero" on the biggest screen you can find.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary, storyboards, an interview with Jet Li, and a soundtrack spot. "Hero Defined" (23 minutes) is alternately narrated and subtitled in English. It follows "Hero" from pre-production through some of its 6-month shoot and includes interviews with director Zhang Yimou and the film's cast. I recommend it for Zhang's comments. "Storyboards" shows the storyboards for 4 action scenes next to the finished scene as it plays out. In "Inside the Action: A Conversation with Quentin Tarantino & Jet Li" (14 minutes), Tarantino interviews Jet Li about his career and martial arts in the movies. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish. Captioning is available in English. Dubbing is available in English and French.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still gives me the creeps"></head><body><p>Any Stanley Kubrick film is difficult to review because he was in a league of his own, directing films in his own way leaving little room for comparison.  While I've never cared for the way some of his films are acted neccessarily, I've always loved the way they've looked and the way the make you feel.  This makes Kubrick a suitable fit for the horror genre.  The Shining, to me, has always been the ideal horror film, taking familiar horror elements to a new level.<br /><br />While the film strays quite a bit from its source material, the ideal ingredients for the horror to take shape are there - mainly isolation and the cold of winter.  What better way to be scared then to be locked up in a large hotel for the winter where the phones don't work and Jack Nicholson can go nuts.<br /><br />The real star of this film is the camera though.  Kubrick has a thing for long takes and tracking shots.  The best shots in this film occur when Danny is in the hallway.  The classic shot  that haunts me to this day is when Danny is riding his tricycle through the hallway revealing the forever eerie twin sisters.<br /><br />The rest of the action is fairly predictable once Jack starts going nuts, and while Kubrick doesn't really stretch the paramaters of the story, his eye for creating horrific landcapes with his lens in the all too sterile Overlook Hotel are gripping to this day.  Add to that the tense score by Wendy Carlos and you have an unforgettable horror masterpiece.</p></body></html>

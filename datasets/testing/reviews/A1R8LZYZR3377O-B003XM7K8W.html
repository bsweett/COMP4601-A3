The film stirs up the real unpredictable nature of people. The premise is a good one. Bruce Willis as a cop has to rescue a family held captive in their own house, but thats not all. His gung ho motivation is that if he retrieves a disc hidden in a dvd case that pertains to a corrupt group, he saves his own kidnapped family. He plays the anxious, must do savior unusually well. The threesome teenagers holding the family in the house(one reluctant)do a decent job of playing some confused, ruthless oddballs. Their is some strong violence and an undercurrent of shear nerve racking bombardment. The empathy drawn out by Willis for his family is impressivly done. The ending could have used a little more work, but it plays. The dvd clarity is excellent and the sound is great. Not a bad watch, but post viewing may require sedation.</p></body></html>

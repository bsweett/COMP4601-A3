This one came and went with very little notice. Given the performance of a number of recent, and far inferior, films of its type, that's a crime. Dead Silence is a slick little horror flick that touches all the bases, and runs over all the familiar territory, without ever seeming terribly cliched.<br /><br />Jamie Ashen (Summerland's Ryan Kwanten) receives a mysterious package on his doorstep one evening-- a ventriloquist's dummy. When he comes back from picking up dinner that night, his wife is dead. A bit too much of a coincidence for him, so, shadowed by police detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg), Ashen goes back to the town where he grew up to find out what happened to his wife, and what it has to do with the doll.<br /><br />You can probably see a good bit of this coming (though I freely admit the ending totally blindsided me), but that doesn't necessarily matter. After all, ventriloquist's dummies are just plain creepy. If you're looking for a movie that will unnerve you, and you don't like ventriloquist's dummies, this one's definitely worth checking out. *** ?</p></body></html>

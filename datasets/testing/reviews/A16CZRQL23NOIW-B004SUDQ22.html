<meta name="summary" content="Joining the broken pieces of a fragmented memory!"></head><body><p>I must start by noticing we are in presence of one the warmest and intimate movies made in years. An intimate a very haunting story that deals with the missed contact with the reality of a very young talented Mathematics investigator. Her daughter tries the best she can to join the pieces in this intricate puzzle of formulas and theorems he left. She assumes the difficult task to further his investigations.<br /><br />Behind this very painful script, I should remark the prominent acting of Gwyneth Paltrow , who must play a razor edge role between insanity and reality, to create this diffuse atmosphere that will swaddle our rational, analytical and cold logic.<br /><br />It is not easy to direct two Oscar winners, but John Madden faced the dilemma and with discrete lightning and closed locations made a very poignant chamber work.</p></body></html>

OK, let's start with an equipment check. Blu-Ray & HDTV, sub-woofer cranked-up, lights out, popcorn in hand. Seat-belt on and here we go. Wow, you want action? You want loud booms and bangs? You want dizzing special effects? This is the movie for you! I just added ths to my list of favorite movies. The plot is relatively simple, but, it just gets in the way of the crashes, explosions and machine-on-machine combat. We have transformers from cockroach size up to monster size. We destroy a steel mill and some historical monuments. Some globe trotting with great scenery. But in summary, its all about the special effects and the transformers. A shout-out for the Blu-Ray version which has a second disk with more contents that the length of the original movie (well over 2 hours of behind the scenes). This movie is highly recommended.</p></body></html>

But only BEFORE they are murdered, with the help of three seemingly vegatative precognitives. When John's precogs see into the future and predict HE will become a murderer, John finds himself the target of his own police force. Can John prove his own innocence, or is he destined to become a murderer?<p>I really enjoyed Minority Report. But I felt the plot was fairly predictable, and the ending was very contrived. I found it hard to believe that a seemingly somnambulant precog female was able to speak, talk, and interpret the sensory feedback she received after being contained within the 'temple' for quite so long. Also, the security was pretty lousy at the police station if John (a wanted fugitive) could so easily break in. *Sighs*<p>Personally, I was much more interested in how the precogs would adapt to the events AFTER the story, than in viewing the fourth quarter of this film. Overall, while I enjoyed Minority, it had almost zero re-watch value. I give it 3.5 stars. I've seen more involved plots on the Twilight Zone.</p></body></html>

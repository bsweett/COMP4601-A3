<meta name="summary" content="Great mob story set in London"></head><body><p>Brutal yet artful, subtle yet gripping, "Eastern Promises" packs dynamite in the story, acting, and directing departments.  Director David Cronenberg and his new favorite lead actor Viggo Mortensen (they previously teamed up to make "A History of Violence") return to tell a gripping story of the Russian mob in London, and how fate brings the mob into contact with an ordinary family who suddenly finds itself with the power to bring the mob hierarchy down.  Mr. Cronenberg doesn't shy away from the brutality of mob violence, but he doesn't linger on it, either.  Still, the movie isn't for squeamish viewers.<br /><br />Two short but satisfying special features round out the DVD: a seven-or-eight minute piece that features the director and actors talking about the film, and a seven-or-eight minute piece about the history and role of the elaborate criminal tattoos featured in the film.  Combined, you get a good fifteen minutes or so of satisfying behind-the-scenes information.  For most films, that's actually enough for me when it comes to special features.  My widescreen DVD featured crisp, clear picture and sound.<br /><br />In you enjoy films in the organized crime genre, you'll probably like "Eastern Promises" a lot.  It has all the elements one expects to see in this type of film, but also throws you a few curves, too.</p></body></html>

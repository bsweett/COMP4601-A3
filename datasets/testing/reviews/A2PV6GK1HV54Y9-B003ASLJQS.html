The beginning is tragic and the rest of the movie is a bit slow and one-dimensional. This is not Eastwood's best film, but the acting is superb thanks to Sean Penn. The performance that surprised me the most was Tim Robbins, he never stood out in his movies but this one he does and it's amazing. This film is a mixed bag, decide for yourself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="They drew first blood not me 8.5/10 part 2 on Rambo Trilogy ultimate edition"></head><body><p>I have been wanting to to review this movie for awhile First Blood starring Sylvester Stallone as a Vietnam veteran John Rambo Richard Crenna as Colonel Sam Trautman & Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Tessle. Ok we start off with Rambo is looking for 1 of his old Vietnam war buddies unfortunately he finds out he died of cancer from complications of Agent Orange well then Rambo goes into the small town of Hope Washington Rambo is going to get something to eat & but is harrassed by Sheriff Tessle. So when he is dropped off Rambo well he turns around Sheriff Tessle abuses his power & arrests Rambo at the police station he gets treated like s**t which bring back NAM flashbacks eventually he escapes & that's where the fun begins. I have this on Blu Ray it's actually a ok Blu Ray whit the different ending commentary was entertaining interviews were good. Stallone is great with the action & good acting wise & Richard Crenna I think had the strongest character as well as being the support in the 2 & 3.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best action movie ever!"></head><body><p>Of course, everyone has probably heard of this excellent film starring Bruce Willis. While there are 3 films in the series, this one is really the only one needed. The 2nd and 3rd are descent but not great films. Bruce Willis stars as John Mclaine who goes to a party which ends up being interrupted by a group of terrorists. Mclaine, the cop, obviously has to do something about this.<br /><br />This is the best action movie ever with some wickedly cool scenes. Bruce Willis proves that he is a great actor with some great lines (yipikaye mother f#$%^*) and when he curses at the lady at the police station on the phone because se thinks that it's a prank. This movie blows the Bond movies and all of the other action movies out of the dust and will remain the true great action movie, and the movie that trully jumpstarted Bruce Willis's career.</p></body></html>

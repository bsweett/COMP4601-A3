The past few movies based on his works have been duds, including this one. Honestly, the only good Stephen King movie was The Shining. In this movie Johnny Depp plays a writer who is having trouble starting his new work of fiction, and to add into the mix he is going through a divorce, which is only there in the plot so the ending can be what it is. One day a tall southern man dressed in black comes by and accuses Mort (Depp) for plagerizing a story of his. The man's name is John Shooter. As the story progresses things start to become more serious with Shooter, and basically that's it for the story until the mildly shocking end. I was mad when I saw the ending (people who know the plot of my script will know why), but don't get me wrong it's a good ending it's just that I thought of it first (Okay, fine, maybe King did publish it before I wrote it down last year). Anyway, the only problem with the ending is that the "idea" is good except the effect is a stinker. The audience will ask at the end of the movie "Okay, now what? Why did I sit through this entire thing?" There is no reason behind the motive, there is really no message to the movie, and usually psychological thrillers have those. This comes across as a thriller without a brain, no smarts included. The movie also contains no jump out of your seat moments, it does however have two or three scenes that will get the heart pumping a bit, but no jumps. Overall a bad movie with a good out of place ending that leaves the audience saying "So What?!"<p>ACTING: This is a one man show here. Like Colin Ferrel in Phone Booth. Without Johnny Depp this movie would be a crapstaviganza.  The only thing is that Depp's approach to the role gives some comedic moments to the film, and at some points that changes the tone of the movie, which in the end does not make the story run smoothly. I know why they did it though, because without Depp's comedic charisma this movie would be extremely borring, EXTREMELY!<p>BOTTOM LINE: The movie is a stinker, no doubt about it. The name Stephen King used to hold attention at the movies with such classics as The Shining and Pet Cemetery. Now we have Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital on TV and Secret Window in the movies. Icky Poo! The ending is good but can be seen a mile away and is very out of place in a movie like this, David Koepp who penned the screenplay did not do a very good job of building a "shocker". If you have a bunch of people in the audience saying "I knew it!", then that's a good sign that your movie failed to deliver.</p></body></html>

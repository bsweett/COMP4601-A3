<meta name="summary" content="The Exorcism of Emily Rose - scariest sh*t i've ever seen"></head><body><p>A priest is accused of murdering a young 19-year-old girl, Emily Rose.  Some say she had epilepsy.  Others say Emily was physiologically unwell.  Some even say that she had a mixture of both.  Emily, in fact, was possessed by evil spirits, and she was taking medication to help her.  The priest who came to do the exorcism on her told her to stop using the drugs and focus on religion to help cure the evil in her.  This, however, didn't work.  It made her case worse, and she ended up dying just to escape the spirits.<br /><br />The girl who played the part of Emily Rose was outstanding; I was really convinced that she was actually possessed and not playing a part.  Laura Linney plays Erin Bruner, a lawyer, who defends the priest.<br /><br />This movie mainly takes place in the courtroom, where witnesses tell their side of the story, which intern flashbacks to the scenes of where Emily is alive.<br /><br />There is a lot of dialogue in this movie, and some may consider it boring.  I found the storyline very interesting and well written.</p></body></html>

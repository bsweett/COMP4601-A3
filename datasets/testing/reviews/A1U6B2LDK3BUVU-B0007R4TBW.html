<meta name="summary" content="Drugs imply guilt, according to dad the shrink"></head><body><p>This is an interesting movie worth seeing.  The theme that emerges, once you get to know the characters and their history well enough to put it all in perspective, is that the main character was damaged by psychiatric drugs all his life, his father being a psychiatrist who thought he knew what he was doing.<br /><br />When he was a little boy, our hero lost patience with his constantly complaining mom, and gave her a push.  She fell over something, injured herself, and spent the rest of her life crippled.  In response, the father put the kid on prescription drugs, his way of saying that the boy was dangerous and out of control.  The "fact" is that it was just an accident, and the little boy was not dangerous or out of control.  The mother was extremely annoying, so much so that she got her son to give her a little push out of frustration.<br /><br />Years passed, and then the woman accidentally drowned in her own bathtub.  Again, the father would want that to seem like the son's fault, for that push he gave his mom so many years ago.  He wouldn't want to take the blame on himself.  Personally I think he should have had a talk with his wife way back then, letting her know how inconsiderate it is to be complaining all the time.  If he had given her enough verbal pushes, maybe the child wouldn't have had to give a physical push.<br /><br />The father is ponderous.  By the end of the movie you realize what a villain he is.  Fortunately, most of the movie leaves him out of it.  It follows the son and his friends.<br /><br />His most interesting friend is Natalie Portman, a young woman with an odd sense of humor that has her making up tall tales.  Much is made of her being a "liar", but I don't see it that way.  Is a comedian called a liar for telling stories?  Once you accept the fact that Natalie's character enjoys putting people on with tall tales, I don't see a problem with it.  I'm fine with her sense of humor.  Can you only be considered a comic if you are getting paid for it?  Is a stage the only place you are allowed to put people on?<br /><br />One drawback of this film is that since the main character is supposed to be drugged into numbness, how do you make him interesting to watch?  I think the movie had to struggle with that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Filled With Magic Dust!"></head><body><p>Although the premise of this movie is far fetched it works because of its sweetness and fantasy.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner plays a woman who gets transported from her 13 year old birthday party straight into her 30's, by passing all the joys of childhood and puberty she finds that she has turned into a horrible grown-up in more ways than one. Garner is pure innocence and absolutely infectious in this silly role that few actresses could have pulled off so well. As a modern woman sophisticated enough to be an editor for a fashion magazine in New York she fumbles about as the transported child/woman and causes quite a havoc in her childish wake. The pranks and gags are funny especially the constant references to that great old era "the 80's", completed by the "Thriller" dance remake that will have you dancing or laughing or both!<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo is cast as the love interest for Garner. As her childhood best friend he has become lost in the shuffle of Garner climbing to the top and he gets lost far behind. But as the child/woman Garner finds all that she missed along the way and the puppy love begins. Ruffalo is a great guy, not too macho and not too pretty so he manages to come across perfectly as the best friend that waits patiently in the wings and he is adorable.<br /><br />This movie works for adults as well as teenagers and is a pleasant film to watch. If you know the 80's it is filled with funny nostalgia and great music. If you skipped your childhood bent on success this film will encourage you to find that playfulness and inventiveness that so many adults lack. Colorful and fun this movie ROCKS with plenty of magic dust to take us all back a few years to the land of enjoyment.</p></body></html>

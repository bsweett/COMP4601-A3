<meta name="summary" content="Parker Posey shines, but the rest of the film is a bit tired"></head><body><p>I am probably giving away my age but, as a child, I used to enjoy Superman on the radio.  I also read all of the comics.  By the time the television series began however, I considered Superman "kid stuff" and, for this reason, never saw any of the film versions of the Superman saga on the big screen either.  However, I'm now a grandma.  So watching "Superman Returns" with my 5- and 6-year old grandchildren was an interesting experience.<br /><br />When the film opens, Superman, played by newcomer Brandon Routh, is returning as Clark Kent to his mother, an elderly Eva Marie Saint.  He's been traveling in outer space for five years, trying to discover if the planet he originally came from, Krypton, still exists.  It doesn't.  And so he is thrust back into his life as both Superman and the quiet reporter, Clark Kent.  Naturally, he wants to see Lois Lane again, who just happens to have a 5-year old son and a boyfriend.  Of course there is also a bad guy.  That's Kevin Spacy, and he is introduced in a scene with an elderly woman which was extremely confusing.  This bad guy has a girlfriend, played by Parker Posey, who adds a bit of life into the rest of the film which seems a bit tired.<br /><br />Much to the delight of my grandchildren and the rest of the audience, there were great special effects.  However, I spent a lot of time explaining superman facts to them, like where Superman came from, and that the bad guy can hurt Superman by using Kryptonite. There is one part where the bad guy is beating up a weak superman which upset the children, but I was sure to tell them that in a movie like this Superman will ALWAYS win out in the end.  All of this explanation caused my grandson to as me, "How do YOU know so much about Superman, Grandma?"<br /><br />Yes.  I did enjoy the film.  But I don't think it had anything to do with its quality.  "Superman Returns" would have bored me completely if I didn't have my fresh-faced grandchildren to play mentor to.  That's why I can only give it a very modest recommendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clutching Joyce and Hiding My Eyes...Yeah, it's scary!"></head><body><p>Joyce had never been to a scary movie with me before. I warned her that I could get very frightened and that she might not like the experience. (Neither hubby nor my brother-in-law like seeing scary movies with me after my freaking out on them in theaters. So I knew how bad I could be.) The amazing thing is that I figured out the big twist in this film within the first thirty minutes or so. Did this calm me down? Of course not! I was still scared! The plot line involves a woman waiting for her husband to return from World War II in its winding down aspect, circa 1945. She lives in a big house on the Channel Islands with her two children who must avoid daylight since they are allergic to it. Thus, the house is perpetually dark and gloomy, fitting the ghostly aspect of the story. Has this woman's house been invaded by ghosts or others and, if so, who are they? That is the crux of the thriller and it will have you on the edge of your seat. Nicole Kidman is superb in the lead role. When the film is well written, she is showing again and again that she has what it takes as an actress. Regardless of to whom she is married, she should be recognized as a considerable talent in her own right.</p></body></html>

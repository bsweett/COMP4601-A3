<meta name="summary" content="Really A Jurassic Adventure!"></head><body><p>What more can be said about Jurassic Park than has already hasn't been said? The movie was phenomenal. When I saw it in the theatre, I was amazed at how real the dinosaurs were. They were real looking and life-like and right in front of me on the screen.<p>The energy of the film was adventurous and who can forget Jeff Goldblums best line "at least when the ride breaks down the Prates don't eat the guests...". Sam Neil and Laura Dern were superbly cast in this film. The kids were charming and right on the money with their reactions.<p>Visually the film is eye candy. The mechanical effects of the creatures and the digital effects of some of the long shots made my mouth drop. The story is again simple but the plot is very obvious. Even Sir Richard Attenburough gives a stellar performance.<p>The DVD is filled with behind the scenes footage of the film and its production. The interviews with Spielberg, the cast and crew are very interesting. The mechanical items and the CGI (Computer Generated Images) and their renderings are incredible.<p>The DVD is a great package to get - the movie alone is worth watched and all the extras are just icing on the cake. Gotta love it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Basic Feel-Good Film"></head><body><p>Russell Crowe stars as boxing champ Jim Braddock in Cinderella Man. As the film opens, Braddock, like America, is in his hay-day. Money's flowing, he's winning, and his family loves him.<br /><br />Flash forward a few years and we're into the Great Depression. Renee Zellweger plays his wife, Mae who is doing all she can to keep her children moving forward. Braddock hasn't done so well in the ring (never being knocked out however) and can't find a job.<br /><br />When he loses his boxing commission, the couple looks to the worst.<br /><br />But then his manager, played by Paul Giamatti, gets him a fight at the last minute. The up and coming champ needs a fighter and Braddock is just the man. Thinking this is just a final fight for him, Braddock accepts the fight because the money is so good. And he ends up winning the fight! This sends him on a one-way trip to the top in a match against the heavy-weight champ Max Baer. Baer has killed at least 2 guys in the ring.<br /><br />With America cheering for him, Braddock steps into the ring for this huge fight. It's like Rocky, only real life.<br /><br />This movie was fantastic. The acting was phenomenal. The only downside would have been Giamatti's character had to swear just about every time he spoke. But, incidentally, the swearing added to the humor of the scene.<br /><br />Go out and get this movie. You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />..Unless you don't like to feel good...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="brutal, humorless classic"></head><body><p>This film comes from the 1970s auteur period of nakedly awful stories about the dregs and losers.  I remember enjoying my reaction to this as an undergraduate, the way that it kind of freaked me out, which is a substitute for experience in the young.  This time around, while I recognize its significance, fine acting, and relentless realism, I half wondered why I was putting myself through it.  OK, you endure it for the sake of art, but it is so awful that I may never do so again, which leads to the question, why buy it?<br /><br />Scorsese, DeNiro, Keitel, and Foster completely deserve the praise they received.  They portray losers in the drama of a massive, then-deteriorating city, in which a man is going insane.  He pulls Keitel and Foster into his web of horror and alienation with the surety of a pendulum, to the unspeakable violence of the climax.  It is painful to watch:  a horrible story about horrible people to whom horrible things will happen.  Then there is the commentary on the media:  Travis becomes a hero by his action, though it is clear the pendulum continues to swing.<br /><br />There is also a very good documentary about the film.  It is a must for Scorsese fans and Taxi buffs.<br /><br />It is a great film, just not very fun.  I would recomend renting it rather than buying it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not one of my fave Disney films"></head><body><p>For some reason, and I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'm really not into Sleeping Beauty. I adore Disney movies and have seen pretty much every one, with the exception of a couple. This does not rank high on my list.  The story never really interested me, the music was just OK. It came as a bit old fashioned for me.<br />That said, It's certainly not a bad movie by any means, just not as enjoyable as some of the other brilliant ones out there.</p></body></html>

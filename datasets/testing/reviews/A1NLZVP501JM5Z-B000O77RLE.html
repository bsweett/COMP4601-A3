Of course Letters From Iwo Jima is about the battle of Iwo Jima told from the Japanese perspective with English Subtitles.  I didn't see Flags of Our Fathers so I can't compare the two.<br /><br />The acting is very good, Ken Watanabe is as good as ever and the guy that plays "Shago" was great.  The direction is good, I was hoping for more battle scenes on Iwo Jima but I heard Flags has more fighting.  This movie moves slowly at first but once we come(Americans) it all pretty much goes to hell for everyone.<br /><br />I loved the sepia toned, drained look to the movie and the ending is great in my opinion.  The only part where this movie drags is in the beginning, but thats a minor complaint.  It also has one of the most disheartening scenes I've ever scene.  I guess I gotta put up the big SPOILER! warning to talk about it, so SPOILERS!<br /><br />Its the scene where the roomful of Japanese soldiers blow themselves up with there own gren@des.  Now that we are talking about v!olence lets talk about how bad it is in this movie.  Honestly, its not that bad.  Yes, there are some graphic scenes, but if your kid has seen GLADIATOR OR Kingdom of Heaven or another war movie he/she should see this.<br /><br />Overall this is a heart wrenching, great look at how bad war is.  And that no matter what side you are on there are good and bad people.  Probably most importantly it says that in war there are no winners, only losers...</p></body></html>

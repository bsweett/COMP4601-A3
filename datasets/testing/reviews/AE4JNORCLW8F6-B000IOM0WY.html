<meta name="summary" content="Everything you want in an action thriller"></head><body><p>I love a movie that you have to watch from beginning to end to fully understand. The Italian Job is that kind of engaging, but action-packed thriller. The cast has an exciting chemistry that keeps things interesting throughout the movie. And, of course, there are the Mini Coopers. Well worth the watch, lovers of an exciting, but intellectually stimulating action thriller will love this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bringing It All Back Home"></head><body><p>Like The Trouble With Tribbles,IV may not be the best(II tops them all),but it's certainly many fans favorite.<br /><br />  What makes this film work is its humor as well as its warmth and heart.The cast look like they're having so much fun filming it, that it rubs off on the audience.Equally funny is seeing our beloved crew of the USS Enterprise,looking awkward and out of place in the 20th century.<br /><br /> The movie is also fast paced as many obsticles(the Klingon Crystal depletion,the search for the whales in the ocean as well as the hospital scenes)pile up upon one another yet successfully resolving themselves.Subsequent film that try to replicate IV's formula end up looking clumsy(V and Insurrection)because they miss the point that behind great comedy is heart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Exceptional filmmaking"></head><body><p>It is rare that a film can be called one of the greatest love stories, war stories, epics, and so on, and so on.  Well it is.  It's basically the best  of everything and that might just be an understatement.<p>The acting is  superb and nothing less.  Mel Gibson gives the best performance of his life  so far and one of the best performances I have seen.  In this movie, the  characters really interact with each other on an emotional level,  they  fight for the things they have passions for.<p>Some say the movie is not  historically accurate.  Well I don't know if that's true, but who really  cares?  This movie is stunningly realistic.  The battle scenes really bring  the audience in.  There is no censorship here, and there is no looking  away, they are purely shocking.  The emotions that the characters go  through are realistic and moving, I dare anyone not to be affected  emotionally.<p>This movie is also beautiful visually and aurally.  The  scenery and art direction is right-on, and takes us to a different world.  The musical score by James Horner is haunting and melodic, not to mention  one of his best.<p>This movie is exceptional, it makes you part of it.  If  you haven't seen it, you have no idea what you are missing.<p>MOST HIGHLY  RECCOMENDED!</p></body></html>

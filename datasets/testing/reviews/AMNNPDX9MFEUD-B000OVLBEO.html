There are good actions sequences and the special effects are well done but they aren't enough to keep the moving from slowing down in parts. As for the acting, Nicolas Cage is pretty wooden and Eva Mendes does little more than show off her cleavage. For a cheap movie rental, it is entertaining enough, but I wouldn't want to buy it.<br />Two final things - I considered taking my kids to see this, the youngest of whom is 10. I am glad I didn't. Yes, I understand that the rating is PG-13, but most parents assume that PG-13 isn't so bad. In this case, I am a bit surprised. The movie is continual frightening imagery and I would warn parents of pre-teens to have a look yourself beforehand. From one parent to another it is something to consider.<br />Secondly, during the special features documentary there is a part where the costume designer describes how she made risky back-room deals in Thailand in order to procure rare sea creature skins for the costumes including shark and sting-ray. I found her giddy attitude about making these illegal and rather unnecessary purchases to be wildly inappropriate. Her Hollywood mentality puts her frighteningly out-of-touch with the criminal and immoral world of animal trade. She acted like a teenager who'd stolen a pair of flip-flops from Wal-Mart instead of an adult who enabled the slaughter of animals for their skin, especially when you consider that no one would've known or cared what the costumes were made of outside of her small cadre of colleagues and that avoiding animal skin by using other materials would've been easy and more cost-effective. It was a shameless act of irresponsibility and excessiveness. What a sad statement.</p></body></html>

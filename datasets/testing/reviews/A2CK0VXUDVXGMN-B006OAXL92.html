<meta name="summary" content="Beautifully filmed, but the story, the emotion?"></head><body><p>This was a beautiful movie to look at and magical at times, but in the end it left one flat.  While it was touching to regard the inventor of movies receive the acclaim he deserved (or was it, his movies looked a tad silly), it did not seem to be enough of a conflict or problem to inspire an emotional tie. In short, this viewed did not cry at the end, he merely shrugged his shoulders.  A decent enough movie, but not great.  It certainly does not deserve to be included in the pantheon of great Scorcese films.</p></body></html>

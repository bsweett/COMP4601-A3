<meta name="summary" content="Unexpected approach...."></head><body><p>Director David Fincher takes an unexpected approach to telling the fact-based story of the Zodiac killer from the 1970s. Instead of spending a lot of time focusing on the acts of the killer, the film focuses primarily on the investigators involved in the case and one man's obsession with finding the truth.<br /><br />Expect more dialogue and clue-chasing rather than grisly acts of murder, although there are a few of those. Silence of the Lambs this ain't, but it's still a well-acted and well put together film with dark psychological undertones (of which Fincher has proved to be a master since "Se7en"). The actors all give good performances, escpecially Robert Downey Jr. who seems to shine above all others.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film, but found that a one-time viewing was enough for me. I was really too young to remember the case, but it was interesting to learn more about one of the most famous serial murderers in U.S. history. The fact that it was a true story was a big plus. If this had been a work of fiction, I probably would not have cared for the film at all.<br /><br />For those of you who loved the film or if you love DVDs with extras, please wait until next year before shelling out your money for this film because a definitive director's cut will be released with oodles of extra features including modern-day interviews with surviving victims and investigators of the case.<br /><br />Overview: it's worth a look, but not a purchase, in my humble opinion.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="nine inch nails meets Bunuel"></head><body><p>Here is a horror films for adults and thinking teens, more psychologically threatening than relentlessly violent. Buy into it and you will be rewarded with at least one sleepless night.<p>The film works a high-concept urban legend: A VHS cassette brings death to those unlucky enough to view its stream of bizarre images. The remake of Japan's "Ringu" stars Naomi Watts as a newspaper reporter caught up in the mystery of the tape <p>"Ring" director Gore Verbinski channeled Bunuel and nine inch nails for his version of the video snuff film, creating a compelling film within a film. The fun continues on the "Ring" DVD, with a new Verbinski short that's accessed by clicking on the link "Don't watch this." (Verbinski knows his shorts -- he created the Budweiser frogs.)<p>The 15-minute film unveils a few more clues about the sinister tape, including its last-known location. (Hint: Late fees most likely won't be collected.) Those who care will have fun slowing the blitz of images with their DVD remotes to reveal even more clues or red herrings. A handful of "Ring" outtakes get burned off along the way, not always gracefully.<p>DreamWorks says Verbinski chose not to include the usual making-of extras in order to preserve the mystery of "The Ring." The DVD of the original has a trailer for the remake, and vice versa. Universal, as usual, slips in trailers for its current boxoffice fare on both discs.<p>"The Ring" looks great, handling with equal aplomb the grim black-and-white and the visual relief of rich fall colors. Aspect ratio for the widescreen version is 1.85:1; full frame also is offered. The DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio tracks are oddly tame, biased toward the front channels.</p></body></html>

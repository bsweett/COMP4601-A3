<meta name="summary" content="Deceiving Trailer = Boring Film"></head><body><p>I saw the previews for this film and it looked awesome. I couldn't wait to see it, but could never find anyone interested enough to go with me. I finally rented it and was fairly disappointed.<p>The storyline sounds incredible. Werewolves (called "Lycans" in the film to make them sound cooler) vs Vampires? How much cooler can you get? Unfortunately, the coolness factor doesn't expand beyond the concept. Yes, the film does feature Lycans battling Vampires. Unfortunately, the only way you'd know this is by the occasional glimpse of teeth and shot of a full moon. They fight the entire movie with guns. I felt like I was watching a bad splice of The Matrix and Blade. What is the purpose of showing these two historical enemies fighting if they're going to be running behind each other with Uzis? <p>Almost no typical vamp/wolf lore was explored. The ONLY thing the vampires do to show they're vampires if bare their fanged teeth and can jump from big heights. They don't shy away from the sun, turn into bats, suck blood, or anything else which makes vampires cool. The film even refers to them at one point as "bats" yet you never see it. <p>Scott Speedman provides a forgettable performance for all of his 15-20 lines in the movie. The ending is VERY anticlimactic and is just a very watered down gun fight that would have been too boring to make it's way into The Matrix. I had to watch this film over 4 days because I kept falling asleep. What's more, the lycans looked absolutely ridiculous when they changed. The werewolves from "The Howling" 20 years ago had better make up. <p>In regards to the DVD, I had a few problems with it.  The film is very dark, mostly shot at night, in tunnels, or in the rain.  The sound was also poorly reproduced on the DVD.  I was constantly having to change the volume.  I would raise it for speech, and as soon as the action started, the sound would jump and I would have to lower it.  I realize something blowing up should sound louder, but not this loud, and the differences shouldn't be so high where I have to keep my finger on the volume button the whole film.  <p>The extras on the DVD were fairly boring.  Some throwaways like trailers, teasers for other films, and a storyboard comparison, which no one ever cares about.  It also featured a montage of scenes from the movie set to music called "Sights and Sounds."  I don't know what this was or if it was supposed to be entertaining.<p>The featurettes contain a fairly poor "Making Of" special, a commentary with the director, and a special on the visual effects.  <p>Overall, Underworld is a great concept, but the addition of guns and high tech weapons, as well as the idea to turn this into an action film instead of horror, ultimately cause it to fail.  The relationship between Beckinsale and Speedman is never explored beyond a single kiss, even though the film leads you to believe this is another "Romeo and Juliet" story...</p></body></html>

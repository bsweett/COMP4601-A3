<meta name="summary" content="In Our Time -- with Spielberg"></head><body><p>Stephen Spielberg is one of our time's greatest directors.  The fact that he can balance out a real artistic vision while remaining unashamedly mainstream is truly remarkable.  Still, in movie after movie there is a groan-point.  A character will make a speech, or a scene dripping with sentimentality intrudes into what up that point has been a nearly perfect film (Schindler's List is a prime example, Saving Private Ryan also has its moments).  After so many years of watching Spielberg efforts however, I'm throwing in the towel.  Spielberg, I'm convinced, doesn't do this out of calculation; it's who he is:  an American director who loves nostalgia and sentiment.  And to be honest, to see the alternative is easy enough to do.  Spielberg is not David Lynch - a great, but weird, director.  No, he's Main Street without the teeming dark corners.  Oh, there's darkness with Spielberg, but light as well, and Hope.<br /><br />So where does that leave Munich?  I think in a pretty good place.  The only "speech" that I heard, the kind that Spielberg cannot resist, popped up at the two hour mark, and it was pretty brief.  Something about revenge being endless.  (Still, I confess I'm mystified by those critics who have damned this movie because of its ambiguity.)  As usual, with Spielberg, great actors and performances, and a pretty fast moving movie for being close to three hours.  It grabs you from the first moment. My only real criticism is the way Spielberg chose to unveil the Munich massacre.  Dramatically it didn't seem to serve much purpose, since the event is unveiled in bits and pieces, with the climax (no pun intended) revealed while the chief Israeli assassin makes anguished love with his wife.  That just seemed weird - and not in a good David Lynch sort of way.  Just clunky.  I think a straightforward telling of the Munich attack would of worked just as well.  But it doesn't sink the movie, or irritate in the way past Spielberg moments have.  Definitely worth a watch, though I'm not sure it's the resonating piece on our times that Spielberg intended.</p></body></html>

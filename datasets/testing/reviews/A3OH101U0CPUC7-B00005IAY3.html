<meta name="summary" content="Ponderous"></head><body><p>The movie focuses primarily on Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), an electric line repairman who goes to work one night to fix a massive power outage and sees several low flying spacecraft.  Many others see these craft including Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon from A Christmas Story) whose son is later abducted by the aliens.  At the same time, a group of researchers who apparently work for the government travels around the world gathering information on various alien sightings and encounters.  All of this comes together when everyone converges on one spot to find... well, that's the question that plagues all of them.<br /><br />The government researcher scenes tend to be chaotic and confusing.  It's not unusual to have to sit through a few minutes of incomprehensible material before you can finally understand what's going on at the very end of the scene.  They also didn't add a whole lot to the film, especially given the amount of time they take up.  The plot line involving Roy Neary is the most interesting.  After his encounter, he's driven by strange compulsions but he doesn't understand what they mean or how to deal with them.  His family gets pretty freaked out, especially his wife (Teri Garr).  If his wife wasn't screaming all the time, this would have been a great story, but she gets old very quickly.<br /><br />The climax of the film involves a light show that lasts about twenty minutes as various alien ships dart around, hover, and finally land.  They then play a rousing tune for a few minutes to communicate even though they give the earthmen no way whatsoever to put the notes into any meaning or context.  It felt like an endless nightmare watching this scene drag on and on before it was finally over.  I'm fine with a peaceful encounter but this could have been done in one fourth the time with absolutely nothing lost.<br /><br />It's difficult for me to recommend this movie.  For hard-core sci fi or Spielberg fans, you should see it once for yourself because it is one of the milestones in the genre.  Anyone else can safely skip it since there are far more entertaining films for you to choose from.</p></body></html>

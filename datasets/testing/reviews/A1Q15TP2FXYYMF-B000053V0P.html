<meta name="summary" content="The Ultimate Alien Invasion"></head><body><p>This is in my personal opinion one of Will Smiths best movies, it didn't recieve that much love from the critics but i personally adored every minute of this movie.<br /><br />One day in July huge alien spacecraft settle over the major cities of the world, without any warning or indication of their plans they just hover over the cities. In an effort to communicate with the alien spacecraft the millitary send helicopters out to them to try and gain some type of positive reaction, but the reaction they got wasn't planned or wanted. They attacked and destroyed the helicopters and then initiated their initial plan, the center of the crafte opened and revealed a weapon that could destroy miles of the city. Within minutes New York, Washington, Moscow, London, Berlin and other major cities where wiped out in a matter of minutes, this sparked the millitary to launch a counter attack whith no effect whatsoever because they have a shield that cannot be penetrated.<br /><br />That is all i am going to tell you about the movie as i feel i may have ruined the best part of it for you but i must say this that this is an incredible movie and for it's time had some of the best special effects. Full of action and in a way holds some truth by showing how vulnerable our planet would be if something like this where to happen.<br /><br />Buy it i promise you will love it</p></body></html>

The film is based on a book by Michael Lewis.  I had previously read "Liar's Poker" and thought it to be a great piece of modern literature.  The film also had a top quality cast including Brad Pitt in the lead role.  What could have gone wrong?  I'm not really sure but the whole package didn't gel.<br /><br />In brief, "Moneyball" covers a season in the life of the Oakland A's, an American major league baseball team.  The franchise is not rich as it is based in a comparatively small and not particularly wealthy region.  In fact, the team has only a third to spend in comparison with the New York Yankees.  On this basis alone, the team will always lose in the long run.<br /><br />However, within this difficult environment, the viewer is introduced to Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who is the manager of the team.  Billy understands his situation and knows he cannot compete on the basis of money alone.  He has to be creative.  He is assisted in this task by the chance discovery of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who is a nerdy baseball statistics geek.  It is Peter who convinces Billy to look deeper into the numbers to locate unwanted and, therefore, cheap, playing talent.<br /><br />Although the film is based on a true baseball story, it fails to please.  Something is missing.  To baseball aficionados, my word may seem sacrilegious.  However, the fact remains that the film is based on a weak thread and the quality of the cast is unable to overcome this handicap.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Complete Nonsense, But Very Well Done."></head><body><p>My bargain-rack movie for last night was "Ghost Rider " (Widescreen Edition) starring Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Well, to begin, I was totally unaware of the Ghost Rider thing and the comics upon which it was based so I had zero preconceived notions. Well, I have very mixed feelings about this as a movie. I didn't care much for the movie, but I found it interesting in a variety of ways. The whole story and the premise behind it is preposterous and requires a strange mixture of beliefs in the supernatural, various religions, the devil and a whole bunch of hocus-pocus drivel in order to enjoy and "understand" the plot. I'm lacking in that background and just regarded it as unmitigated nonsense. Furthermore, the acting was substandard, to say the least, and the characters were stiff and unsympathetic..<br /><br />However, the production of this movie and the stunts and special effects were spectacular. Time and time again I was left wondering: How did they do that? It's really amazing and I found the movie to be very interesting, not for the story, but for the production. Some of the stuff that is shown here is of Academy Award Nomination caliber, but it's saddled with a non-sensical story line. So, what does one do and how should such a production be rated?. Well, strangely enough, I wouldn't mind watching it a second time and that's compliment in itself. Use you're own judgement. If you're tolerant of complete nonsense as far as the story is concerned and want to watch an enjoyable display of special effects, then it's not a bad movie at all.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

I'm not sure how many real people are actually in this film because after a while it looks like a saturday morning cartoon.  Too much CGI and not enough of anything else.  The story is lame, the acting is lame, the dialogue is more than lame. As to resolution, well as loud as it was, I finally gave up and fell asleep. Save your money, the economy is bad.</p></body></html>

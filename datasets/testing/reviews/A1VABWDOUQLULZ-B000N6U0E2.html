<meta name="summary" content="Running Man"></head><body><p>I had high expectations of this film, what with Will Smith, his son, and the down-on-your-luck-single-man-with-a-child bit.  On the side of sentimentality it delivered the prerequisite emotional tugs to heart strings.  But it really did nothing more than that.  I was immensely impressed with the extra footage of the real Chris Gardner and his presence, and wished even more that Smith had embodied even a scrap of it.  From an acting standpoint, it wasn't even a stretch for Smith, though I'm sure working with his son was a learning experience.  I think he ran more in this film than any action film I've ever seen him in.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="AN AWESOME SEQUEL  9 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>This film unfortunately, was the least liked of the trilogy. Personally I think it's almost as good as the first film. Like the first film, you should watch this and ignore everything to do with Twilight (If anything, that will rot your brain and degrade your intelligence). This is a 'real' vampire film, and not an incompetent and poorly made teen drama with no substance and a pansy emo as the main character.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: We are reintroduced to Selene and Michael (Who is now part Lycan and part vampire), who are now on the run from the remaining vampires including a vampire named Marcus (Who takes over after Viktor's death in the previous film) who is angry and is out to find his Lycan (werewolf) brother and free him. Now Selene and Michael must find Corvinus (The father of both vampires and Lycans) and find a way to end this never-ending conflict between the Lycans and vampires and defeat Marcus and his brother. Like the first film, the story wasn't taken as far as it could have gone.<br />MUSIC: I have never seen a film in which Marco Beltrami's music disappointed me, and this film is no exception. This music always sets the mood and flows quite nicely throughout.<br />ACTION: This film is even bloodier than the first film and there's even more shootout scenes, a treat for any action fan. This film gets the adrenaline pumping and never lets up until the end. Another area that this film succeeds in, while Twilight fails spectacularly in comparison.<br />ACTING: Unfortunately, the acting in this film isn't as good as its predecessor. The main actors are great like Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, but there are points in which the other actors aren't quite as believable or there's some cheesy dialogue. For the most part, the acting is good, but there are some actors who aren't as good as the others. However, even the not-so-great actors look Academy Award-winning in comparison to Twilight's actors.<br />OVERALL: This film serves as an excellent sequel to an already excellent predecessor. There's more action and more blood this time around, and it shouldn't disappoint action fans looking for a good time. Again, ignore Twilight at all costs because it's an insult to all vampire films and will make you dumber. It pales in comparison to this great film.<br />THE GOOD: More bloody action, great music, good actors, and a solid storyline.<br />THE BAD: Storyline didn't go as far as it could have, and there moment of cheesy dialogue.</p></body></html>

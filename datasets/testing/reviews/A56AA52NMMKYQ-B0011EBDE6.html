<meta name="summary" content="The Boringly Unlimited .... On the Verge of Funny"></head><body><p>Three American brothers (Brody, Wilson and Schwartzman) meet in India to take a train trip aboard the Darjeeling Limited.  Their ostensible purpose is to re-bond after the death of their father, to seek enlightenment and pursue a spiritual journey.  Later, it develops that the ulterior motive for one of the brothers (Owen Wilson) organizing the trip is to connect with their mother (Angelica Huston), who currently lives as a nun in an isolated Indian monastery.<br /><br />They encounter their mother, who was reluctant to receive them.  Yet, they do not find the closure that they were seeking and that they hoped for.  At the movie's end, they sprint with their luggage to catch their departing train, eventually jumping aboard after tossing their baggage.  Maybe they had baggage they were carrying around about the death of their father and their relationship with their mother.<br /><br />The movie is flagged as a comedy.  I'm not sure I laughed once in 90 minutes.  It is on the verge of being funny, on the verge of being profound.<br /><br />Instead, I give it two stars and three NO-DOZ, to help you stay awake while watching it.</p></body></html>

Lots of creative ways the bad guys die too, such as Bruce driving a truck through an elevator and watching them fall from way up high.  You get plenty of action scenes like those throughout the film.<br /><br />The shooting segments were very well done, and the helicopter scenes involving even MORE guns shooting were done spectacularly.  Great job.</p></body></html>

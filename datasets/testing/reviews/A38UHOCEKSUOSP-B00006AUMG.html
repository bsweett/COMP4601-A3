There are two direction to go, which is stick close to the first film, so that the 2nd seems too much like the first, or go in a differect direction, which might take the story too far from the first film.  Blade 2 does the latter, which doesn't provide as an exciting and tightly-developed story as the first Blade, but the tons of action of the first film remains, along with a lot of fun and excitement.<br /><br />In Blade 2, a virus is transforming the vampires into a breed of supervampires, who are tougher, more agressive, and feed off of the normal vampires on a regular basis.  The leader of the vampire nation calls in an elite team of vampires known as the blood pack, who's leader is played by the impressive Ron Pearlman (Hellboy, Alien: Resurrection).  Among the team, is also a member played by Donnie Yen (Kill Zone, Shanghai Knights, Hero) for all you  martial art fans out there.  The team forms a very uneasy truce with Blade, in order to have some help defeating the supervampires and to seek out the vampire nation's leader's son - who has been turned into a supervampire too.  Whistler returns to the scene, which is a little confusing after the first film, since it appeared he shot himself.  However, Blade 2 decides to bring back his character and explains this in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Most of the movie is action packed, and great action at that.  The story isn't as sharp as the first, because a lot of screentime is devoted to hunting out the supervampires.  About 2/3 through though, story gets a bit more exciting and takes some twists and turns until the end.  As for the action, overall there is even more this time around, but several scenes overdo the cgi a little, and it is evident and distracting.  For fans of Donnie Yen, he has one very cool scene with exceptional choreography, and his character (though without any dialouge) is just bad (in the cool way).  Blade is not quite as cool as in the first film, but he's still just downright fun to watch.  He has a final fight against the leader's son, which is 3 minutes of one of the better fights I have ever seen.  I loved it more than the final fight in the first Blade.  This fight is even faster, harder, and longer.  It is definetly an edge of your seat fight.<br /><br />Blade 2 may not take itself quite as seriously as the first Blade, but it is almost more enjoyable in a fun kind of way.  Tons of action, plenty of gore, and even some frightening moments make it seem scarier than the first Blade.  A hardcore fan may be dissapointed with the direction the sequal took, but someone looking for an enjoyable movie will still love this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slight but decent thriller."></head><body><p>Joel Schumacher's "Phone Booth," delayed first because star Colin Farrell wasn't famous enough to open the film to substantial box office and then pushed back because the Beltway Sniper attacks made the film too topical to release, was compelling while I was watching it, but it has had no staying power with me whatsoever.<p>It's not a bad movie. It's very simple, very brief and occasionally thrilling. It goes exactly the way you expect it will, not needing to extend far beyond its simple premise of a morality play. A gunman, judging people at random from the sky, decides to make Farrell's tacky agent character face up to his sins. If he doesn't, he'll be dead ... or the friends who've gathered to watch his incident will be killed. So he stays on the phone and confesses to save everyone. <p>Of course, the people around him also think that he's a crazed gunman, and he can do little to convince them otherwise. Therein lies the most interesting aspect of the film, one that the filmmakers don't exploit near enough.<p>I remember an episode of "Homicide: Life of the Streets" that had a similar premise to this one, and I think the "Homicide" episode was slightly better than this movie.<p>But, compared to the travesties Joel Schumacher has subjected upon movie audiences in the past, "Phone Booth" was merely slight - not offensive.</p></body></html>

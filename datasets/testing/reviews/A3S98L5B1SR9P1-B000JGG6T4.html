<meta name="summary" content="Man on Fire"></head><body><p>Man on Fire had an interesting plot, with Denzel playing a burn-out "professional soldier" with no direction and emotions.After establishing a relationship as a bodyguard (a position new and way beneath his training) for a young child, he begins to open up and distinguish emotions and feelings. Only after this child's kidnapping and Denzel being critically injured, as well as his belief the child has been killed, does he seek out and administer retribution.Overall, an excellent movie.</p></body></html>

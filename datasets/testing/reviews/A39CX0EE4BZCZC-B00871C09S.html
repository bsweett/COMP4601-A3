<meta name="summary" content="One Of Hitch's All-Time Great Films"></head><body><p>It took me several viewings over many years before I really appreciated this film. Now I absolutely love it. Next to Psycho, it's now my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film.  Having it on a pretty-clear DVD transfer didn't hurt, either.  Eventually, I'd like to see a sharp Blu-Ray version of this movie.<br /><br /> "Rear Window" still dated quite a bit with the dialogue, but the focus of the story, namely Jimmy Stewart's voyeurism and suspicions of what is going on in Raymond Burr's apartment, never gets old.  It is a storyline which entertains and builds tremendous suspense. Stewart provides the fun and Grace Kelly is there for looks.  The people Stewart observe are really interesting.<br /><br />Speaking of dated, can you imagine all the people in the crowded  apartments keeping their blinds open all the time?  Maybe it was just a more trusting world back in the 1950s!</p></body></html>

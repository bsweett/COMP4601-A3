<meta name="summary" content="The most ultra-realistic depiction of Hilter to date."></head><body><p>Seeing/hearing a movie such as this in the German language adds another layer which makes the movie ultra realistic.<br /><br />Furthermore the actors who play the key roles, especially Hitler, but also Goebbels, Speer, Himler are so alike to the actual historical figures it really is eerie.<br /><br />What sets the film apart from other WWII/Hitler films is that the characters are portrayed as human beings -- NOT stereotypical Hollywood caricatures.  What makes it chilling is that these human beings can be charming and yet a split second carry out the most horrific acts one can imagine.  Furthermore the the director avoids melodrama.  The events unfold on the screen naturally drawing the the viewer into the events as if one were actually in the bunker witnessing the horrifying events before the fall of Berlin.<br /><br />As good as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan were, this film by comparision makes the them seem too contrived and over-acted.<br /><br />This is a milestone in WWII genre of film-making.</p></body></html>

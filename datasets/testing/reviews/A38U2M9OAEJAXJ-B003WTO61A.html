<meta name="summary" content="&quot;The Raven Was Called Sin.&quot;"></head><body><p>Every high school has its misfit, and Bates High school has Carrietta White, played with heartbreaking conviction by Sissy Spacek.  Her posture, frumpy clothes, and timid mannerisms make her the object of scorn from her classmates, who miss no opportunity to tease her.  Carrie doesn't even know her own body, explaining why she freaks out in the gym shower where she has her first (!) period.  But the minute the movie introduces us to her religious fanatic mother (done to near camp effect by Piper Laurie), it's easy to see why she's such a basket case.  And as if that weren't enough, Carrie has the &quot;gift&quot; of telekinesis.  She uses these powers to unleash hell on the night of her prom, where her main tormentor Chris Hargenson (a wonderfully catty Nancy Allen) plays a vicious prank on her.  &quot;Carrie&quot; is not only my favorite movie by director Brian DePalma, but it's also my favorite film based on a Stephen King novel.  DePalma's touch is all over this movie, and that's mainly evident through his signature camerawork.  What also makes this movie such a horror classic is the way it builds suspense to a near-intolerable high.  The scene where Carrie and Tommy Ross are crowned king and queen is done in agonizingly slow motion, creating a buildup of tension that literally ties a knot in your stomach.  The movie also works thanks to the performances from Spacek and Laurie, both of whom earned Oscar nominations.  The DVD has a very interesting documentary featuring interviews with the cast (sans John Travolta, who played the doofus Billy Nolan) as well as a photo gallery, a trailer, and another documentary on the technical aspects of the film.  After over a quarter century since its release, &quot;Carrie&quot; remains a convincing movie that excels both as a revenge fantasy and a horror story.</p></body></html>

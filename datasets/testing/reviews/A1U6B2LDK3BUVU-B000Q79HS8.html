That's the single most important thing a movie must do.  It has to hold the audience's interest.<br /><br />Now for the flaws.  The directing sells sizzle rather than steak, and belongs to the school of Fake it til you make it.  What it does is shoot the action scenes in a purposely confusing way, obfuscation, sort of like a football tv director deciding not to show you the runner evading tacklers and crossing yard lines but rather just showing you things too close up, just a blur, and then he crosses the goal line.  The theory is apparently to keep you on your toes trying to find out what the hell is going on, assuming that this technique will impress you.  I'd rather not play that game.  I'd rather see what is going on.<br /><br />Another major flaw is that the star "never makes a mistake", as one of his opponents in the CIA puts it.  That's nice.  Nice little super hero.  Always does exactly the right thing, never makes a mistake.  That only happens in movie scripts, dummy.  That turns this story into a comic book.  Nothing human here.<br /><br />Actors are too good looking, too acceptable looking.  Give me an ugly lead.  Give me overweight women, plain looking women, women you will actually see on this planet we call Earth.  We as a film audience have accepted the Lala Land these idiots have been painting for us for decades.  Give me some reality.  All this perfection has gone beyond boredom and into the realm of stupid.</p></body></html>

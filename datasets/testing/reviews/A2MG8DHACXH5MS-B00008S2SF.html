<meta name="summary" content="Brosnan's last take on Bond, James Bond"></head><body><p>Madonna sings the theme song and makes a cameo as Verity, the domanatrix-styled fencing instructor during this 20th rendition of James Bond. There isn't much chemistry between Brosnan and Berry but they make a good enough duo to fight a North Korean mercenary in Iceland. The plot plays on the Icarus Theme in Ancient Greek myth whereby a wayward son's overarching ego flies too high enough to the sun that he burns and crashes. A good old 007 time and the swan song of Pierce Brosnan and he sails into the Bond son for the last time.</p></body></html>

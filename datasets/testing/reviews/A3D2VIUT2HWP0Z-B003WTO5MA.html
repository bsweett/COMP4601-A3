<meta name="summary" content="Excellent DVD: Confused Film"></head><body><p>I actually did enjoy the film. It is evident that this film is a first film for the director, and it is MASSIVELY evident that the producer interfered.<br />The story is extremely well known, at least the published version. I would urge anyone interested in the actual story to read Hans Holzer's material on the house; also, compare this with the work done by Diane Warren and husband. This is partially available on the 4th disc in the first three films box set. One of the precluded tv events is a very spookey interview done in Australia on the DON LANE  show in the seventies... this is VERY  scarey  TV.<br />Anyways, the deleted scenes are basically the very scarey parts of the film thrown out by the studio. The Documentary of the background events is extremely  interesting, and the making of featurette is quite interesting , but not as good as the background feature. The commentary is next to useless, BECAUSE this commentary dovetails with the so called multi angle  on set peeks special ... on their own, they would be great, but they are accessible only through a replay of the film.<br />The DVD is a good package, the film is a good watch, but the film suffers from the "too many cooks" syndrome ... it was a neat watch, and with the DVD it is a good elemental set ... now if only someone who is a real horror  spooky house fan could edit the material together.</p></body></html>

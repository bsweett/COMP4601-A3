<meta name="summary" content="A spectacular DVD and a spectacuar classic"></head><body><p>This movie put both James Cameron and Schwarzenegger on the map back in 1984.When the movie starts,it's the year 2029 where the city of LA is basically rubble and machines/super-computers run the show in the future.Expect the fact that some humans survivers and they weren't giving up without a fight and they're led by a man named John Connor.The computers are hell-bent on exterminating the humanrace for good and the only way the computers can destory man's future is by changing the past.So they send an indestructible cyborg called the terminator(Schwarzenegger)back in time to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton)whose unborn son will become mankind's only hope.But the Human Ressitance sent a soldier named Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn)to protect Sarah and her unborn child.The Terminator is one wild and great ride to take.The acting is great,the score is really cool,the images of the future are creepy to see and great screenplay and directing by Cameron makes The Terminator a classic adventure film to watch over and over again.The DVD is loaded with special features like a brand-new "Other Voices"Documentary with new James Cameron interviews,"The Terminator:A Retrospective"Documentary,terminated/deleted scenes,trailer,TV spots and more.The Terminator is a must have in your DVD collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of few good films that came out in 2009."></head><body><p>From the director of "Thank you for smoking" and "Juno" comes another film called Up in the air. The film has been shot all over USA but yet what you get to see are yachts and getaway planes. You see airports, hotels, offices and you see people waiting in lines offended about some jerk who just cut them off in the line because he has special privileges. That jerk is played masterfully by George Clooney who's style of acting I'm finally starting to like. Vera Farmiga played a good co-star and the other actors, I don't know their names so I won't bother.<br /><br />In this film, Clooney shines as Ryan Bingham, a 40 something hedonist who is very good at his job and packing his luggage. The editing is sharp and the soundtrack was good.  I won't bother explaining his job but I can tell you one thing, this is one of those few films which are a little better than what the trailer offers. I don't think we can call this is an indie film because the subject matter is unique. I wondered how the film would end halfway through it. The dialogues are very entertaining and humorous without being fashionably dark.<br /><br />The only thing that surprised me was how I was the only person in the house-full AMC audi who clapped much to everyone's smiling displeasure. Do not miss this film, watch it on the big screen before they take it off. Some very good acting, good characters, good music and heavy handed end. This film has it all. It's not quite the "Catch me if you can" because it is not remotely about crime but still the subject matter is not only engaging but relevant and current. I'll put a full stop to my review now. Must watch.</p></body></html>

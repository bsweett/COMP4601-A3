<meta name="summary" content="Men Who Hate Women"></head><body><p>THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO based on the Swedish novel MEN WHO HATE WOMEN is an intensely engaging film. At 2 1/2 hours, it might seem that the film would be impossibly, indigestably long. In Swedish with subtitles (there is an English language track), it might seem impenetrable. None of that is the case. I watched it through, in Swedish, and never once glanced at my watch.<br /><br />This is a dark film, but it avoids the lugubrious plodding of the typical Ingmar Bergman film, and it avoids the gratuitous hyperintellectualized symbolism of a typical art house piece. In pacing and material, this film has much more in common with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LINC">The Silence Of The Lambs</a> than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020HDI0">The Hour of the Wolf</a>.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace plays Goth Girl Lisbeth Salander, a gifted hacker but deeply scarred young woman who works as a Private Investigator's researcher. Lisbeth, who has a history of psychiatric disturbance, is on probation. At the film's outset, she is assigned a new Guardian (a State appointed Probation Officer/Conservator), who brutally rapes her when she meets with him to request her stipend. Lisbeth, with the hardness that only the truly injured can have, retaliates against her tormentor in a grimly satisfying exhibition of sadomasochistic glee, after which she betakes herself back to her own world.<br /><br />Rapace's portrayal of the tattooed, pierced, troubled Lisbeth is so compelling and realistic that I received a slight shock to discover how normative Noomi Rapace appears in the DVD's brief "Special Features" interview segment.<br /><br />Michael Lindqvist plays Mikael Blomqvist, an investigative reporter convicted of defaming a major government official. Despite the fact that it is quite clear that Blomqvist was set up, he has no option but to serve his sentence, deferred for six months. Unable to work for his paper, he is hired by Henrik Vanger, the paterfamilias of a powerful, clannish, but extremely dysfunctional family of industrialists, most of whom live on a private island. Vanger's beloved niece, Harriet, vanished forty years before, and no one has been able to trace her whereabouts. Vanger is convinced that Harriet was murdered, more than likely by a member of the family.<br /><br />Mikael begins to investigate. In the process, he allies himself with Lisbeth. Although most of the Vangers try to dissuade the pair from accomplishing anything substantive, it quickly becomes evident that the Vanger clan is riddled with rot and evil, including membership in the Swedish Nazi Party and a fearful history of domestic abuse and violence, culminating in what appears to be a number of unsolved serial murders.<br /><br />The violence and darkness of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is indisputable and graphic, but it is not gratuitous. This is not a "slasher" film, it is a profound psychodrama and pursuit thriller. It is definitely not family fare, not for the young and impressionable, or for the faint of heart nor the easily distraught, but there is nothing dishonest or excessive about its portrayals.<br /><br />Many reviewers have criticized the film's expressed violence toward women, but such violence is an all-too terrible fact of life in many quarters. The women, too, are not simply victims. Lisbeth, as the eponymous Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, is an unconventional but powerful character, portrayed powerfully, and the other female roles in the film are likewise portrayals of strong women. If anything, the men in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO are the weaker, less competent, less emotionally, intellectually and psychologically stable sex.<br /><br />This film is not for everybody. However, if you are a cinemaphile, it is an experience that should not be missed.<br /><br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br /><br />***<br /><br />Having since seen the Director's Cut of the trilogy (which adds a full two-and-a-half hours, the equivalent of an entire movie, to the tale of Lisbeth Salander), I will recommend the Director's cut wholeheartedly. It makes all three movies five star offerings---at the very least.</p></body></html>

Ultraviolet is a motion picture that seemingly makes an effort to look more like a video game.  I'm sort of indifferent to that direction I suppose, but it's a point I still think is important to make.  Ultraviolet is visually unique and the pace of the film doesn't quit.  You can tell that director Kurt Wimmer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLWN">Equilibrium</a>) doesn't really want us to believe any of this is real as he is striving to create a dystopian world that would exist otherwise only within a comic book or Japanese animation. Ultraviolet does indeed require a vast imagination, but for some of us that's not such a bad thing.<br /><br />Ultraviolet is a chase movie about Violet (Milla Jovovich) who, among many others in her time (in the late 21st century), is infected with a virus that gives her super human powers.  Violet is part of an underground terrorist group that exists to fight against the resident dictatorship.  Soon enough, Violet steals a child (Cameron Bright) from the government and finds out he may be the cure to this disease that allows her to be invincible and be really good at driving a motorcycle.  The terrorist group she is in with decides the child must die and so Violet begins running from everyone with the child.  With some more twists and turns Ultraviolet leads up to a formulaic showdown and more dramatic and unrealistic fight scenes than you could possible imagine.<br /><br />Ultraviolet is an excessive mess.  The fight scenes are perplexing and miserable to watch, not to mention completely unrealistic, which is something I can almost forgive.  Ultraviolet is the ultimate example of over-stylized filmmaking.  In the action genre, the viewer should probably never be aware that a fight scene is choreographed while viewing it, but if a fine line exists between dancing and fighting then Ultraviolet is balancing very carefully upon it and it is doing so right next to Joel Schumacher's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790732912">Batman & Robin</a>.  The story also seemed jumbled and confusing.  I really wasn't sure what was happening until the very end and even then I had some questions that I wasn't even motivated to have answered.  The dialogue was delivered stoically and isn't very good to begin with.  The music was as distracting as the visuals.  Other than that it was a visually original film and I guess that is where it earns a star for me.  Well, that and Milla's bare bottom.</p></body></html>

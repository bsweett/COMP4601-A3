<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic, but super depressing"></head><body><p>"The Descendants" is a great movie about a man named Matt King (George Clooney) whose wife is in a coma after a boating accident. Because he's always been kind of a hands-off dad, Matt is unsure of how to relate to his two daughters, 10-year old pretentious Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old troublemaker Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). He's also thrown for a loop when his eldest daughter reveals that his wife had been having an affair before her accident. Matt has to cope with the cold hard facts about his marriage, coupled with his wife's grave condition and the toll this is taking on his family. In addition, Matt's family is pressuring him to sell a large sum of land that their ancestors passed down to them, which is located along the beautiful Hawaaiian coastline. The debate over the land has unexpected connections to Matt's personal situation, and the poor guy has to somehow figure everything out on his own.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Matt King is George Clooney's best role, but it;s definitely one of them. He delivers a moving performance as a man who is completely broken, yet forcing himself to keep it together for the sake of his two kids. I was also very pleased with Woodley's performance as Matt's teenage daughter. Hers is a very complex role, and the young actress tackles it with grace and honesty. The film itself is incredibly well-done, though extremely depressing. I'm glad I saw the film and I definitely recommend it, though it won't be one of those movies that I'm dying to watch over and over again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A truly inspiring naval adventure..."></head><body><p>One of those movies that has grown (a significant amount I should say) on me over time, `Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is probably, in my personal opinion, the greatest swashbuckling sea adventure film ever filmed.  Now, when I walked out of the theater the first time I saw this I didn't feel that way.<br /><br />I was supper hyped about seeing this (you think I worship Peter Sarsgaard, you should see the shrine I have in my bedroom dedicated to thy Holy Crowe) and so I was there opening night with all this built up enthusiasm and wound up nearly falling asleep and completely giving into my friends constant griping and concluded that this was a dud of a film.  Problem was, I already promised my father that I would see it with him the next day and so I braced myself for boredom (although I do enjoying watching Crowe do anything).  Get this; there in the middle of the day I watched this film through new eyes.<br /><br />I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Now I was already going to buy the film regardless of my feelings (like I said, WORSHIP) but now I had a new outlook and was highly anticipating the DVD release.  While the film is glorious (I've seen it nearly twenty times and am strongly considering watching it this evening...the wife is away for the weekend which always turns into an excuse for me to eat pizza, drink beer and watch every Russell Crowe movie I own...which is all of them) I have to give a major shout-out to the extras here, because this DVD is packed with them and they are all amazing.  This should be noteworthy coming from me, because if you follow my reviews then you know that I never discuss extras because to me the review is all about the content of the film, not the DVD, but these are just too good to ignore.  I don't generally watch the extras but I've seen these a few times and find them thoroughly engaging.<br /><br />Back to the film.<br /><br />I think my issue with the film upon first viewing was that I was expecting something totally different.  I was under the impression that the last fifteen minutes here (briskly paced, non-stop action) was the entire film.  It is not.  It is the last fifteen minutes.  Now, as we all know, I love slow brooding character studies; but not at midnight (yes, I went to the midnight showing).  That was a huge mistake, although had it been a high speed adrenaline rush I don't think it would have been.<br /><br />So, like I said, the biggest issue was that I was expecting something else entirely.<br /><br />Upon subsequent viewings (many, as you can tell), I've come to appreciate this film as so much more than just your average high seas tale.  There is a beautiful honesty about its portrayal of sea life that makes me quiver in appreciation, but there is also a genuine sense of comradeship that really becomes the basis for the film in my opinion.  The chemistry between Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany is utterly fantastic and it really makes this a simmering beauty of a film.  There is a natural elegance with the way Crowe portrays Jack Aubrey's feelings towards his crew, and the awkwardness with which he tells a joke (much like a grandfather at a dinner party, unsure of others reactions but sure in his own `need' to tell it) is completely endearing.  Just witness the way he allows his character to seep into his delivery, making every word seem so natural and almost expected ("Name a shrub after me; something prickly and hard to eradicate.")  Matching him every step of the way is Bettany who completely soaks his character Stephen in a rich loyalty and constant admiration.  Even when Jack displeases Stephen you can tell he is only displeased because he knows in his heart that Jack can do better.  He believes in him that strongly.  Both performances are utterly stunning and completely deserving of any and all praise.<br /><br />The fact that both were snubbed of Oscar nominations is disgusting, especially when those hammy `Mystic River' men took home the gold.<br /><br />Peter Weir is in top form here, creating such an authentic look at naval life.  I love the way that the creaks from the wood on the boat can be heard in every frame.  There is not a single false note here.  It's remarkable to tell you the truth; totally and completely remarkable.<br /><br />So, knowing what you are in for will surely heighten your appreciation for this modern masterpiece.  It is the best of a genre and more than that, the best in the world that is cinema.  It fleshes out not just the two men who form the focus of the film, but it fleshes out the world that is sea life; the ship itself becoming a major player in this film.</p></body></html>

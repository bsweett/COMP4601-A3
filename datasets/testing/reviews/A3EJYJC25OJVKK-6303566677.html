<meta name="summary" content="One of the finest movies from 1984!"></head><body><p>There are countless ways to describe how I think of this film; one of them is Spectacular! The first in the classic Terminator movie series is a ground-breaking cinematic work of art of absolutely stunning proportions and put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map and made him one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and early 1990s before several commercial duds would temporarily dampen his success later on (Batman & Robin anyone?) until "Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines" came along. The groundbreaking movie is the story of an extremely bleak future where Los Angeles and much of the world's civilization is wiped out by nuclear Armageddon when a computer program/internet named Skynet, goes out of control, and the machines, under control of it, unleash a reign of nuclear terror and destruction, decimating much of the human (non-machine) population, and taking over much of the world, except for a few surviving humans who have gathered forces to fight against the machines thanks to a rebel leader named John Connor who leads what remains of the human race into ultimately smashing the machines into junk, ensuring victory against them. However, the machines send back a human cyborg 45 years back in time to the year 1984, to kill John Connor, by means of "terminating" a waitress woman named Sarah Connor, who is the future mother of the human rebel leader, which would result in John never even being born in the first place. In the year 1984, Sarah Connor's life seems like any ordinary life: living as a waitress at a slighltly seedy L.A. Restaurant, and barely balancing a checkbook. She has no idea that it will take a massive turn. A rebel soldier named Kyle Reeves is also sent back in time to protect Sarah Connor, and her 'unborn' son from the emotionless Terminator and thus fighting for the future of humanity. At that point, it is evident that Reeves would not only protect John Connor but in fact, turn out being his father later on. What makes The Terminator even more dangerous is that he is able to copy other peoples voices, and yes, even copy women's voices, making him even more likely to find where his target is. The human cyborg does not feel emotion; it does not feel pain; it cannot be reckoned with. He can blend in with the rest of society as he is part human, part machine, with flesh on the outside, but machine and robot on the inside and all these things make him so much more dangerous to be reckoned with. <p>Parents, be warned! There are truckloads of disturbing violence in this film and also some extremely bloody scenes that will scare young children and I can't blame them, even I have become unsettled when watching this when I was younger but sadly worse stuff has happened in real life. There is one scene which I'm not going to mention for fear of spoilers, that even I had a relatively tough time handling. Occasional profanity also makes this movie one for the more grown-up audiences. However, it also brings to mind, the possibility of what might happen if man and machine do in fact, start fighting each other especially with all of the computer viruses that plague the internet today. It also brings to mind that it is possible to actually build a machine that could do the same things that Terminator actually does in this movie. In top of it all, it is very chilling as the movie's story does brush very closely with reality at the possibility of all of the things happening in this movie actually occurring in real life especially with all of these computer virus attacks that have crippled businesses these past few years although time travel may not be possible because it would likely have messed up the timeline already.<br /><br />This film, while it was a highly ground-breaking film back in 1984, has really begun to show it's age, especially the futuristic battle scenes where the floating spacecraft vehicle looks more like a toy suspended on a string than a realistic looking battle vehicle but this movie was made during a time before the special effects technology would skyrocket not too long afterwards, often to an excessive degree. Also it was filmed and The special effects also kind of look cheesy now due to the time of their creation, but only to a mild degree. The two latter Terminator movies benefited from superior production but while parts of the first Terminator movie have really dated badly, there is no denying that this is still a five star plus movie and I highly recommend buying this for those who want a highly brilliant movie, with violence and action that meshes along with the storyline, as opposed to the brainless, thug war violence of a lot of today's movies ("2 Fast 2 Furious" anyone?). While parts of this movie really show signs of being extremely dated, particularly the futuristic battle scenes in 2029, the low budget spent on making this incredible movie really went into good use thanks in part to a strong story and stunning directing thanks in part to the blossoming talent of James Cameron. "Terminator" is arguably one of the best movies from the 1980s and also one of the most fascinating and most innovative sci-fi action movies of all time. <p>"The Terminator" is a highly essential film for the ages. From here through the next two movies, we hear that unforgettable line "I'll Be Back!". Whether to see cinematic innovation or just simply have fun, or just have some 1980s nostalgia, this movie delivers all of the above and is an essential film and the success of it resulted in two dynamite sequels. It's so unbelievable how James Cameron took the low budget spent on the movie's making and turned what could've been a long forgotten throwaway sci-fi flick into a timeless modern masterpiece. All three of the Terminator movies are masterpieces. Go and buy this today and get the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2: "Judgement Day" as well!</p></body></html>

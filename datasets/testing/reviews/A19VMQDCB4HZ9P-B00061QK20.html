<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful, lyrical and classically epic film"></head><body><p>I have seen this film on dvd and have enjoyed it ever since, but now --- thanks to Quentin Tarantino --- I've been given the chance to see Zhang Yimou's film where it should be seen: on a big-screen theater.<br /><br />Hero is one of those rare films that transcends its genre roots. In simplest terms, Yimou's epic is nothing but a kung fu film. Where Yimou's film excels and exceeds its predecessors is in its use of the color palette. Hero's use of vibrant solid colors to represent a certain sequence of events and point of view is surpassed only by Akira Kurosawa's classic Shakesperean samurai epic Ran. As in Kurosawa's classic, Yimou infuses the screen with vibrant colors to tell a story of love, vengeance and in the end, the true meaning of heroism. Hero's scenes burst with color. From the solid crimson that dominates the Calligraphy School sequence to the solid colors of red, turquoise, yellow, etc.. on the characters costumes. Just the use of color alone makes Hero a must-see film for students of film and cinematography.<br /><br />Yimou's film owes alot of its narrative to Kurosawa's other Shakespearean samurai classic Rashomon. His film tells the events detailed by Jet Li's character, Nameless, to the Emperor Qin of China through flashbacks. Each telling is countered by a different version the Emperor has been told in advance. Each Rashomon-like sequence also points out that truth will always be subjective. What is truth for one individual may turn out to be a lie for another. The dialogue between Nameless and the Emperor are as riveting as the martial arts scenes the dominate each flashback sequence. I would give Hero a less than perfect score just for the fact that its story gets lost once in awhile in the visuals and pageantry of Yimou's direction. This might become a problem for audience who can't keep track of what they're watching and reading the subtitles at the same time.<br /><br />Jet Li has always been a favorite actor of mine. I've seen most of his films from his Hong Kong kung fu films to the mediocre ones he has made since arriving in the United States to try his hand in becoming a Hollywood star.. Hero shows that Jet Li is more than a silent, kick-ass martial artist who is only good in making kung fu flicks. He does more than his share of fighting in Yimou's film, but during his dialogue exchange with the Emperor Qin, Li demonstrates that he is a very good actor. The audience is never really sure what his character's agenda from the beginning and part of this should be laid at Li's acting chops. He keeps Nameless enigmatic, but at the same time charismatic enough for people to root for his character. It is not til the end that we find out what has been motivating Li's character. The other actors in Hero are a who's who of Asian cinema: Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen and Zhang Ziyi. The limited time that Zhang Ziyi is given in Hero doesn't diminish her excellent work. I honestly think that her work in this film is much better and more polished than the one she did for Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. She's even more beautiful in this film than she's ever been. She conveys her characters youth, passion and impetousness with equal fervor. Maggie Cheung is the opposite, but no less impressive. Her character is the balance to Ziyi's. She gives a wonderful performance of calm reserve holding back pent-up passion and emotion. Like Lee's martial arts epic, Hero treats its female characters on equal footing with its male players. This is quite a feat since the story itself is based historically during China's Warring States period when females where not given equal treatment barring the few exceptions.<br /><br />Zhang Yimou has made an extraordinarily beautiful, lyrical and classically epic film. One doesn't have to be a martial arts aficionado to thoroughly enjoy Hero. It should satisfy and entertain both men and women. It is quite a shame that it took Miramax 2 years to release this film in the United States (it was released in 2002 in Asia and has already been nominated for Best Foreign Film during the 2002 Oscars). Region 0 dvd copies are already in the market and people have ended up seeing this film only in that format. I suggest for those who have only seen this film in that way to run out to whichever theater is showing it and buy themselves a ticket to see this film the only way to see it: on the big screen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wes Anderson continues to be a unique and wonderful voice"></head><body><p>While this got very mixed reviews from the critical establishment, I found I really enjoyed it.  Wes Anderson's style is consistent with his earlier films;  the same great use of pop music, great tracking shots, low key, oddball humor and  detailed performances.  But here, in the story of three brothers trying to re-connect on a trip to India, there's once again a human, emotional core under the absurdity.  Not perfect, but better than 98% of what's getting made.<br /><br />The Criterion Blu-Ray is really gorgeous, but I gotta say the regular DVD, non-Criterion release still has quite a nice image.  Go for the Criterion if you can, but if cost is a big factor better to get the plain old DVD than not get the film at all.</p></body></html>

Grace (Nicole Kidman) is an overprotective mother, shielding her two light sensitive children from the outside world. She hires several people to assist in care of the children and household, but these servants share a certain secret, protecting both Grace and the children from the reality of what is happening. The pace of the film is slow but measured, the characters convey the intensity and sometimes terror of what they feel; Nicole Kidman particularly ratchets up the level of intensity and territorialism, acting as a mother in the most protective and frenzied manner. The reality of the situation finally comes to light at the end, one of the psychological twists one expects from a particularly well done film. The film is a fine cinematic achievement.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="True Love Transcends Time, Space & Circumstance!!"></head><body><p>Even this film, like the amazingly uplifting story<br />contained within it, is a cinderella story that translates<br />across continents and socio-economic status!<br />In a world which is so cynical and jaded and has<br />seemingly lost it's capacity to be impressed by or moved<br />by anything that doesn't have a huge price tag or glamour<br />attached to it, here's a story that stimulates the human<br />spirit in a way that is very refreshing!<br />During the 2008/2009 awards season, I was like many people<br />who wondered just who and what in the hell was<br />a SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE!! As it systematically cleaned<br />house at all the major awards: The SAG, Golden Globes<br />and The Oscars against some very stiff competition,<br />this underdog of a film began to recieve much buzz and<br />a tidalwave of curiosity from people who wanted to see<br />what all the hoopla was about!<br />I can't really say much more than what has already been<br />said about this movie by a score of other reviewers.<br />The whole cast (Especially Dev Patel & Freida Pinto)<br />pulled it off with the stellar vision<br />and direction of Danny Boyle.<br />The young actors who played Jamal, Salim & Latika as<br />children deserve major kudos too!--Great Job!<br />As I said, with movies like Milk, Benjamin Button,<br />The Changeling, The Reader, The Wrestler, Doubt<br />and others, all of which were amazing projects themselves,<br />it was truly a long-shot for this foreign-based feel good<br />low budget but very well made film to even get a nod,<br />let alone win Best Picture Oscar and damn near<br />everything else but the kitchen sink!<br />Slumdog Millionaire is a great film and proof that in<br />this world that's much too concerned with being cool,<br />ultra sarcastic, and afraid of coming off as corny,<br />that a film about the underdogs and good guys<br />finishing on top has won out!---Check It Out!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superb Cautionary Tale"></head><body><p>This is what happens when you create a fight, but won't accept responsibility for your actions. Nicolas Cage plays a gunrunner who will sell any weapon to anyone-all under the table so that the major arms selling countries like the US have plausible denial when wars begin. This movie works on many levels, as a tale of misbegotten fortune, a political thriller, and action, action, action. Some humor too. Well rounded, reality-based and attracive, this is a super buy.</p></body></html>

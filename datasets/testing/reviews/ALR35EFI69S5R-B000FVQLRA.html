Of course, the fact that it was Academy Award winning director Roman Polanski chosen to direct the project was a critical choice in bringing this shattering story of a man who found his humanity in classical music even in the midst of the Nazi takeover of Poland during World War Two to the screen. Given Mr. Polanski's personal experience as a Holocaust survivor, he has an exceptionally well-hewn capability to recreate all the sights, sounds, and sensibilities of the times to the movie with loving accuracy. In so doing he has created a modern masterpiece along the lines of such similar treatments of the period as Stephen Spielberg's "Schindler's List". <p>Yet, while Spielberg apparently was striving to paint a broader-brushed treatment of the period and the horrific excesses of the Nazi treatment of the indigenous Jewish population during the war, Polanski concentrates much more exclusively on the personal journey of a solitary human being, in this case a pianist so singularly focused on his art and its centrality to his existence that he is often almost schizophrenic in his ability to ignore or block out all the mayhem, chaos and destruction that surrounds his every move.  Against such a backdrop of the momentous events transpiring from the German army's invasion of Poland in September of 1939 through the end of the war is the pianist's story so marvelously told. His survival through the most barbaric of conditions imaginable is a testament both to his good luck and his hardy strength of will to survive for the sake of his blessed classical music. <p>Young actor Adrian Brody, in an Academy Award winning performance, both accurately and amazingly portrays the almost unbelievable events experienced by author/pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman as he makes his tortured way through the brutal gauntlet of the Nazi killing machine bent on the systematic extermination through the combined strategies of enforced work regimes, slow starvation, and murder in the death camps. The protagonist survives through a combination of his own wits as well as through the unexpected and strictly forbidden assistance of others, many of whom literally risked their own safety and lives by reaching out to aid him.<p> Polanski puts a human face on the Germans as well, showing at one point how in the midst of the unspeakable horror many of his colleagues were visiting on the Polish Jews and gypsies, even an officer in the Wehrmacht could be willing to risk his own safety to assist the pianist. The cinematography is remarkable, with a superb depiction of the massive destruction that modern war brings in its wake. The overshots of a totally destroyed Warsaw is a graphic demonstration of such total devastation on a scale so unimaginable that it would be otherwise difficult to grasp either intellectually or emotionally. This is a film that belongs in any serious film fan's library, and one I can heartily recommend for all but the youngest viewers. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

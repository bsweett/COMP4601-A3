The characters are deep, when you stop and really look at them.<br />*The style (even though very heavily saturated with strange transitions) does a good job at giving the film a comic-book look.<br />*The actors are not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The film's style, despite being somewhat nifty, is also a little too bizzare to watch.<br />*The storyline is slow, melodramatic, and hard to figure out in some places.<br />*Some scenes look too dark.<br /><br />This is a case where an artistic style has gotten in the way of what should be an exciting, brawling action movie.  What action we see is pretty cool, but we need to wade through a mile of confusing slow-paced drama and weird film effects before we get there.  I think it's not a bad start, but the sequel "The Incredible Hulk" is truly way better.</p></body></html>

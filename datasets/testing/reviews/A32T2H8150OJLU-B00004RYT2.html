The mission did not, however, turn out to be routine.  About 3/4 of the way to the moon a faulty piece of electronics caused an explosion that put the three-man crew in great danger.<br /><br />This movie does an outstanding job of telling the story of the astronauts on this mission, as well as of the NASA ground crew that had to solve problem after problem in order to find a way to have a chance of getting the crew home safely.<br /><br />Why this film is great:<br />1) The acting is top-notch.  With actors like Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, and Kevin Bacon, how could it NOT be?  The entire cast did an outstanding job.<br />2) This film is based on a true story that held the entire nation, perhaps the entire world, in its grip (and personally, I tend to prefer a good true story to a good fictional one)<br />3) The re-eneactements of the critical thinking and work of the NASA ground crew, scientists, and technicians added the realism needed to pull off a realistic telling of this story<br />4) I've visited the NASA Johnson Flight Center in Houston, and the original ground control room is still there (though there is now a new one that ground control uses).  I don't know if filming actually took place in that original flight control room, but it sure looked like it to me,  That also added to the realism.<br />5) The intertwined storylines, including the crew, the NASA ground staff, and the astronauts' families made for a gripping tale.<br />6) The music was awesome<br />7) Ron Howard is an AMAZING director.<br /><br />I can't really think of anything that would make me consider anything less than a 5-star rating for this amazing show.<br /><br />There is, you may want to know, a smattering of mild language scattered throughout the movie and a some innuendo, and one blurred shower scene  that I know I could have done without, adn that in my opinion didn't really add to the show.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a 5-star show through and through.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Post-Apocalyptic Horror Show."></head><body><p>_28 Weeks Later_ (2007) is a post-apocalyptic science fiction film which is a sequel to _28 Days Later_ (2002) which features the response of the British government to an outbreak of the rage virus which turns men into mad zombies.  This film asks the difficult question as to how disasters should be prepared for and as to what role government should play in restoring order.  The government in this film (run by the American army) is given an ambiguous role to play.  Difficult decisions are required which often lead to the loss of life.  In one particularly disturbing scene, the rage virus breaks out and a crowd of people flee a building as the army officers are forced to shoot randomly into the crowd.  The moral question involves whether such actions are justified in light of the fact that the rage virus is spreading through human contact and that once contracted it leads to blind madness.<br /><br />This film begins with a group of survivors who are hiding out in an old house.  A husband and wife live together with an older family, hiding from the rage infested zombies.  However, one day a young boy comes to the house and is followed by the zombies.  The husband manages to escape but is forced to let his wife be overtaken by the virus.  The movie then focuses on the man and his children who are being brought back into the country.  The country now exists under martial law controlled by the United States military.  As it turns out however, the man's wife had a special genetic eye condition that enabled her to survive the rage virus, but she still remains a carrier of the infestation.  This leads to her infecting the populace.  The rest of the movie features the man's children and a few others trying to flee the virus as it spreads throughout the people.  Unfortunately, the man himself after making contact with his wife quickly becomes infested with the rage virus.  His children along with an army officer and a medical officer must flee the rage infested zombies.  The movie ends on a highly disturbing note.<br /><br />This film is good entertainment, but also raises disturbing questions concerning military preparedness and the role of government.  It is recommended for those who like such films and who would consider these issues while watching a movie of this type.</p></body></html>

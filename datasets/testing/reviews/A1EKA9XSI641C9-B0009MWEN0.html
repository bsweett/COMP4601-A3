Some say that this is a dull film spending too much time on the youngsters who join the Mobile Infantry to become citizens of the Federation, turning it into a soap opera in space, when it could be focusing on the action on the battlefield.  Well folks, it does both of these in a good balanced ammount.  It's even better for those who like this movie since it has a running time of 136 minutes or so, so you can just eat this up for it's long running time if you like it, or fall asleep if you don't.  We start off with Johnny Ricco, a guy just getting out of high school with his friends.  Interestingly enough they all decide to join the military to get special privelidges afterwards except for Ricco, who joins for his girlfriend, but ends up wanting revenge when his home town is destroyed by astroids sent by the arachnids, giant bugs that kill people very violently.  The Federation is the collective that controls most of what happens in the world and there are several little TV news breaks that come on to show us updates about events in the war and other things much like Robocop, which was also written by Ed Neumeier.  Once this movie takes off from the opening subjects of leaving home and meeting new people we are thrown in the violent world of epic battles directed by Paul Verhoven.  Expect to see limbs flying and people getting chopped in half left and right.  If it weren't for the nudity and extreme violence this movie could be rated PG-13.  It has a very upbeat and alot of the time comical mood, Verhoven makes his satirical films as cheesy as he can to aid the social comment by using humor, and there is some good stuff in this one.  What more can I say?  The special effects are amazing, and some of the acting isn't to great, but that's to the benefit of Verhoven's mission.  The ending of this film might seem a little abrupt, but there is a sequel (don't roll your eyes just yet!).  Let me tell you that Starhip Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation is a movie that continues the story on a differnt plain and doesn't wear out the elements.  It may be a video release but it is enjoyable.<br /><br />I recommend that everyone see this movie, but they might want to cover their kid's eyes at a few parts.</p></body></html>

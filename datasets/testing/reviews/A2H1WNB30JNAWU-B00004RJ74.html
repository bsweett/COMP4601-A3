<meta name="summary" content="Good mindless entertainment movie"></head><body><p>Moive came on time and in perfect condition.  As for the actual movie it's one of those movies you just sit back and watch for mindless entertainment. Plus it also has as some other people have mention some great one liners threwout the movie.  The one that sticks in my mine is teh stripper saying "welcome to slavery" and the male actor goes "No thanks I already got a wife."  I also thought special effects make up was very good.  So if your looking for a horror movie to just take up some time and help you relax as time goes by pick this movie up and enjoy some good mindless entertainment for the evening.</p></body></html>

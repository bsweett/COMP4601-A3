Tobin (Penn) is a man with a past.  He's a police officer/detective trying to figure out if Silvia is telling the truth.  Is she involved?  Is she making the whole thing up?  Is she in danger?  Is he in love?  The film is tragic and dramatic and on the edge of your seat exciting.  Kidman is amazing here, brilliant performance proving she is one of our greatest living actresses.  Penn does well, but it's no oscar winner thats for sure.  The thrills don't quit as Silvia is harrased by the men wanting to assasinate the president of some african country.  Questions keep getting raised and you think you know the answer but then you know you don't so you just have to keep watching and expect the unexpected.  As Silvia's past unravels new questions come up that question her intentions and makes it hard for Tobin to trust her fully.  The problem is that Silvia is not willing to explain.  Does she want Zuwani (the african president)dead?  Is she in on it?  Is it really happening?  What exactly did she hear?  Keep asking them but you will have to wait until the gripping conclusion to know the full truth.  Great entertainment!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another Game of Death from Jigsaw; Experience Shock and Visceral Sensation Again"></head><body><p>Considering the very short pre-production period, and the enormous pressure that the filmmakers must have been feeling after the surprise hit of `Saw', it must be said that `Saw II' did a very good job. The script of the sequel, which was originally written as a thriller unrelated to `Saw,' surely borrows many elements from other films including `Saw' (yes of course), but still is effective as suspense with much gore, largely due to its better editing and sound effects.<br /><br />[ONE THING] you must do before watching `Saw II' is to see the original, in which one serial killer Jigsaw spears. It is very important for some characters re-appear in the sequel, and they play a considerably significant role in `Saw II.' And it would be a good test for you - if you find the original too violent and gory, you don't have to see the sequel, which is equally violent and gory.<br /><br />The sequel again shows the characters trapped in an old dirty room - this time eight persons - for the reasons only Jigsaw knows. These elaborate tricks are set up by the same Jigsaw, who again keeps on watching these confined characters through some media, but this sequel has a nice additional touch. For the two police detectives (Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer) are allowed to share the same experience as audience in the way I should not reveal.<br /><br />But the escape from the deadly house wholly depends on the actions of the trapped people, All the lethal traps or props are prepared in the most sinister (or nasty) way you can think of. Still, if you have seen the films of this genre, it is not difficult to anticipate what is coming next. At least you can sense something is there, even though admittedly some of the scenes involving these tricks always looks painful, or are really scare-inducing at times.<br /><br />However, as some viewers have said perhaps too rightly about the improbability of `Saw II' and its story, these characters often behave in the most stupid way, and the script is full of plot holes. Why don't they realize the importance of the hints Jigsaw gave right before them?  Why do they do unnecessary things like you know what? But booby traps are called booby traps because they don't catch wise people, so let's forget the incomprehensible behaviors of some characters, and not-so-good acting of some players.<br /><br />The ending (no spoilers) of `Saw II' is certainly surprising, but you may call it silly. But I found the original's ending surprising and silly, and in this sense the sequel did a fine job, a rare thing you can find these days when you see dreadfully silly sequels like `Cube 2.' `Saw II,' which benefits from bigger budget and more calculated editing, is a success as far as its visceral sensation goes. For all the dull explanations about Jigsaw's motives or many other atrociously philosophical nonsense, `Saw II' doesn't hide the fact that the film is all about the 'game,' about having fun, about feeling sensation and shock, and as such it is quite good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A rare blockbuster: it holds up"></head><body><p>I remember I must've watched Men in Black at least 4 times during its theatrical run. I just really really liked it, then of course there's the VHS release now the DVD release. I don't know what it was that drew me in so quickly. I think it's a rare movie that manages to be on both spectrums, that of being silly and outrageous while being serious and straight-faced. And unlike Independence Day, this one's actually funny, better paced and just all around better.<br /><br />Aliens exist in the world with most of them looking very much like regular people. However, like people, some of them stray and try to stir some stuff up so in come the Men in Black, a secret organization that keeps aliens secret from everyone else. When one alien decides to cause some stuff that could spell doom for everyone on Earth(of course), it's up to Kay and new partner Jay to save the world.<br /><br />When the disappointing sequel came out a couple of years ago, Sony decided to re-release the film in a "Deluxe Edition". The extras are pretty much the same except for some previews for MiB II. So it's pretty much just buy this if you haven't got the old one but if you haven't, might as well get this one. The featurettes are ok but the commentary was slightly annoying. Presented in a quasi-MST3000/football match style, on occasion the director and Tommy Lee Jones almost act like guys who haven't seen movies ever with stuff like "and there's you saying that line" and whatnot.<br /><br />What ultimately makes the film succeed is a couple character moments throughout. Kay's backstory is explained involving a woman that helps the film become more than just a simple flashy blockbuster. Not to mention the film can still entertain with funny lines or just physical comedy. There's no weak link in the cast and the effects still hold up after all these years.<br /><br />Should you buy it? Definately. It's funny, exciting and it's perfectly paced. Just don't watch the sequel...eek.</p></body></html>

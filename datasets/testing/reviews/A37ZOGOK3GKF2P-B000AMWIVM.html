<meta name="summary" content="This SAW has Teeth!  Bzzzzzzzzzz!"></head><body><p>Wow!  Very few times I get suprised, especially in the horror genre.  Then out of nowhere comes a movie that leaves me breathless.  Intense, gory, thrilling, and complex.  This film has it all.  It is like "Se7en" meets "Hannibal."  This movie is twisted, even sick at times.  Just when I thought I knew whats going on, bam!  A new twist.  The ending is top notch.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Well worth seeing twice, to see if you can pick up clues that were missed the first time.  I see a sequel is in the future, hell this could be a new franchise.  Move over Freddy, Chucky and Jason.  There's a new killer in town, and he's smart.  A highly charged thriller well worth the time.</p></body></html>

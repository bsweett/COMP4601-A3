<meta name="summary" content="Modern Moonshine"></head><body><p>In the bleak, back country of Missouri there exists the country folk. Desolate rocky land, dirt roads, run down homes and people filled with despair, and in this case some of them filled with Methamphetamine. The new moonshine is Meth cooked in the ancient old lean-to or any old building around.<br /><br />Ree Dolly is a seventeen year old girl who is bringing up her brother and sister, and caring for her mother who is mentally unstable. Her dad has gone missing, he was noted for the good Meth he manufactured. He must have done it for laughs because God knows there isnt any money in the family. Dee is scraping dirt and bone to keep the family together. Sheriff shows up one day telling her that if her father does not show up for his hearing next week, the house and land will go to the bondsmen. He wants to know where her dad is and she tells him, she does not know. "But, says Ree, "I'll find him".<br /><br />What a remarkable film this is. This young woman, played by Jennifer Lawrence has taken this story, and it belongs to her. Her performance is outstanding. More than believable, this young woman doesn't give up, remains somewhat optimistic in the environment of a dark and dreary life. Ree goes to her relatives, her uncle, Teardrop, (where do they get these names?) played by John Hawkes is the ragged, thin, lifeless kind of man who is really all steel and nerves. No help from him or anyone who might claim to be family. Ree has a week and in between looking for he father, she provides for her family the best she can. Neighbors are kind and give her a part of what little they have. Ree perservers because she has to, there is no alternative. She finally wonders if her father is dead. It would solve the problem if he was- the house and land would be hers. Essentially she is alone. This seventeen year old girl is keeping her family alive, Her brother and sister play happily. not knowing what is really going on. What strikes me is that somehow this family knows they are loved, that is what keeps them going. Ree is in charge and at no point does she waiver.<br /><br />A really remarkable film, taken from a book and it looks like it is very true to the story. In this Missouri backcountry, Ree is ray of Hope and Light. It has to be that she is loved, what else could keep this teenager moving in the right direction. Ree will figure it out I am very sure of that. The tension and  violence that encompass this area of America has a tiny light.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 11-07-10<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0QL7I">Down to the Bone</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Suspense Thriller Boils Down to Predictable Adbuction Flick"></head><body><p>Yes, I realize my title does little to conceal the outcome of this movie, but I think that it does save the viewer an hour of wasted time to reach the, forgive me, fairly ridiculous conclusion that is set before us.  I am not going to get longwinded on this review, this movie isn't worth it, but I will say that I am thuroughly disappointed in the outcome of this one....NOTE, SPOILERS AHEAD...the alien abduction theme is tired, and the idea of alien experimentation is also tired, and this movie does little to attempt any new ground with the genre at all.  Instead, it build the premise of a woman who has had a mental lapse at the death of her son.  As time passes, parts of her memory conflict with the appearant reality around her...before long, she is convinced that her memory is accurate and that everyone else around her is delusional.<br /><br />If the movie had stopped establishing plot right here and played out the argument of her sanity, I think they coudl have made a really interesting movie.  Instead, they bring in the alien element.  Aliens, working in secret and looking like us (X-files ring a bell???) have arrived and are experimenting on the bond between parents and their kids and they are surprised to find this intense bond between Julianne Moore's character and he son...and that, in a nutshell, is the second half of this story...Julianne hunting down the bad alien scientest and fighthing to get her son back.  For those of you who are still considering it just to find out what happens, she gets her son back, so no worries.<br /><br />The movie was a huge letdown...its only saving grace is a top notch performance by Moore, who can take second rate material and make it shine.<br /><br />Better luck next time...and next time, FORGET the aliens and stick to psychological plot drama.<br /><br />Scott</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Different, not as expected, Love among the ashes."></head><body><p>As with many movie plots, taking events that happen in most people's lives and exposing them on the big screen can make for some great comedy. War of the Roses did it with divorce, The Money Pit did it with buying the first house, and now the Break-Up does it with the updated live together couple.  With Vince Vaughn as Gary, and Jennifer Aneston as Brooke, the meet at the beginning of the movie, appear to fall in love, buy a condo together, and proceed make a life of it. Enter us and the main film.  Gary is a tour guide in the city of chicago, proud polish working his tail off, and Brooke is an educated art dealer, just looking for some help around the house and acknowledgement. After a failed dinner party with both of their families, the couple has a Falling Out, and the Break up begins.  With some ugly things, and some funny things, a trail of love peeks through. This movie is not a constant laugh-out loud movie, but it has its moments.  But I think the ending was just their. Its one of those things you have to see.  It leave the door open, and leave you hanging, what happens next, which is how many relationships actually end. You might expect the fairy tale ending in a movie, let alone a comedy, but this one is different from that. This movie is a reflextion of today's society. Not the best movie of the year, but a decent rental movie.  For anybody who has been through an ugly break-up of a longer term relationship, this may hit home with you.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Halloween Movie"></head><body><p>I was  more interested in this film than I thought I would be. I am sure you know the plot by now. Kids driving cross country, get side tracked into small town, and encounter killer hillbilly psychos.<br />The first encounter is at a gas station/funhouse. The kids stop to fuel up and take a funhouse ride through a chamber of horrors. This was a fun scene and I love funhouse rides, so ofcourse I loved this scene. The props in this scene are exceptional.<br />Next the kids decide to go investigating the local urban legend "Dr. Satan".<br />This is where the fun begins. They encounter a hitch hiker who lures them back to a house in the middle of nowhere. Here they encounter the dreadful psycho family.<br />I saw lots of inspiration from other films such as: Scarecrows, Rocky Horror, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to name a few.<br />The props in the house are wonderful and the mood of the house is successfully bizaare. It was nice to see Karen Black in this film, and I believe she gave the best performance.<br />The last scene where the last surviving teen gets plunged into some crazy underground community is pretty cool. Almost frightening.<br />This film isn't as bad as some critics say, but it isn't as good as some reviewers say either. It is a fun film for Halloween time and would be great to view at a Halloween party.<br />It isn't a brilliant film, I don't know if it will be a classic, but if you aren't a film snob and don't take it too seriously it can be a fun ride.</p></body></html>

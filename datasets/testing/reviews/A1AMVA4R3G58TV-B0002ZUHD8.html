<meta name="summary" content="Good Summer Flick"></head><body><p>King Arthur is a good summer flick. A different version of the King Arthur tale. Its full of adventure. The special effects and action scenes were well done. I would have prefered to see an actress other that Keira Knightley in the role though. I think the character called for someone stronger. But none the less it is still a fun summer movie.</p></body></html>

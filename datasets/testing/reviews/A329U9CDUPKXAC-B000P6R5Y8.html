<meta name="summary" content="Thank God I saw this movie as an adult"></head><body><p>I can only imagine all the little kids in the movie theater crying their eyes out as the sweet little girl cracked her head on a rock and drowned in the river. And did they have to bring religion into it? Since she wasn't a Christian, we can only assume that she is indeed burning in hell. This movie sends out a lot of negative messages to children like, if someone is bullying you, create fake documents to publicly humiliate that person.<br /><br />2 stars for the acting.</p></body></html>

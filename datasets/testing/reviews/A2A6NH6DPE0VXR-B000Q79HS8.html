<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly superior to the Bourne Identity"></head><body><p>Jason Bourne is back and being chased once again. He has been framed for the murder of 2 CIA agents. They worked for Joan Allen's character so she's doing everything in her power to find and catch Bourne. While a deadly assasin has been hired secretly to take out Bourne as well.<br /><br />  The result is a gripping thriller with intense chases and great action. Matt Damon is at his best once again as Bourne as well. This is no doubt his best role because he's just awesome in it and no one else can do it. He's unpredictable too, you never know what he'll do next. I loved the first one and surprised that I actually liked this one more. I can't wait for a 3rd one.</p></body></html>

Horror at it's very finest!!!"></head><body><p>Great film,great 2-DVD set from MGM,(the out of print Criterion Collection is also great because of the audio commentary NOT included on this set,Criterion I guess,would'nt share)But this great 2-DVD set includes lotsa tasty (no pun intended) exclusive DVD extras to savor!!! This classic horror film won 5 Oscars including Best Picture,a rare feat indeed!!! Classic filmaking in every sense of the word!!! There has been so many DVD versions of this film,but this one(and possibly the Criterion)is the best one to have!!! two thumbs up!!! way up!!! five stars!!! A+</p></body></html>

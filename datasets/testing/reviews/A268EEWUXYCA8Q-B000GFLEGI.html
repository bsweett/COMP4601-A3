Particularly, I think the turning point will be the fact that, as has been spoiled by numerous sources, the zombies are evolving.  But this has at least been subtly hinted at before because in Day of the Dead you not only had a zombie that could think but it was one that could speak as well.  Personally, I think the idea of "evolution" is an interesting and good step in the right direction.<br /><br />But the best part of this movie, besides all of the fun gore and scares, is the fact that even today Romero has kept a firm grasp on his satiric style.  In Land of the Dead, the rich elite live in a tall ivory tower called Fiddler's Green, a bastion of light and beauty in an otherwise decimated world.  Commercials tell the poor and destitute people living the streets outside of Fiddler Green that this is the place to live.  The commercials are like the carrot on a stick concept, held there to entice the citizens into doing things for the rich elite on the offchance that maybe, just maybe, they too can become one of the elite.<br /><br />This concept is taken much further, however, as you have the concept of money still alive.  Truly, in a society as decimated as theirs, what good is the green stuff?  But, they still hold onto it as if their society were what it used to be.  Scenes of people window shopping inside Fiddler's Green, the elite living as if the world outside wasn't dead, and Dennis Hopper's Kaupfman saying lines like "we don't negotiate with terrorists" just compound the satire.  It's fantastic and as satiric as Romero's earlier works.<br /><br />Also in keeping with Romero's earlier works, the zombies retain a portion of what they used to be in life.  It's as if they are trying to be human again.  Just like in Dawn of the Dead, and the zombies who stalk the malls, the zombies in Land of the Dead are all questing to find that human quality.  In fact, it's kinda humorous that the zombies start marching on Fiddler's Green as if they too want to join the elite in it's Ivory Castle.<br /><br />One reviewer here has commented that the movie doesn't look "as sharp" as some of the latest zombie movies and that the way it looks is from long ago.  Romero has always been an independent type director.  This movie is his most expensive film, granted, but in today's society of $100-200 million dollar movies, Land of the Dead cost only 15-20 million.<br /><br />What us zombie fans have come for though, is of course the zombies.  Again, Romero did not fail as he has created zombies with character.  From the zombie band desperately trying to play their instruments, to the gas station zombie who is the first to evolve, all have more character than seen in the majority of zombie films.  My personal favorite is the nearly headless zombie.  You'll know what I mean when you see him.<br /><br />Basically, this is Romero at the top of his game in my opinion.  It isn't as gory as the Dawn of the Dead remake, nor is it as scary or intense as some of the zombie movies out.  But, what it might lack in scares, it makes up for in intent.  As far as that goes, Romero is still the king.  Here's hoping it sells well so they make the sequel.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Very Best Of Its Kind"></head><body><p>"Sometimes, the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living".  With that simple phrase uttered in "The Others", perhaps the greatest horror/thriller in cinema history commences.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Others" sees Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two photo-sensitive (can't be exposed to any natural light) children living in an old mansion in post-WW2 Europe.  While waiting for the father of the house to return from war, the house and family are suddenly intruded-upon by seemingly otherworldly inhabitants, who have the ability to come and go as they please, sight unseen.<br /><br />I wish I could say so much more about this incredible film, but doing so would likely ruin the overall experience.  As such, I'll just say this: The only other films in this genre that even challenge this on are "The Sixth Sense" and "What Lies Beneath".  Not too shabby of company, for sure.<br /><br />Also, please--whatever you do!--do not pass this movie by because it is advertised as a "ghost story".  It is more truly a psychological thriller with a paranormal element.<br /><br />Overall, "The Others" is on my "short list" of greatest films of all-time.  Many films claim to channel master director Alfred Hitchcock, and most fail (often miserably).  This one actually delivers.</p></body></html>

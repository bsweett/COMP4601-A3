It's probably sacrilege to say it, but I've always found him over-earnest, even in junk like "Species". Anyone who caught him recently in "ER" vicing someone's hand were subjected to the full range of tics, eyeball bulging, sweating and imposing theatrics he could muster until total thespian meltdown was achieved.<br /><br />This film didn't appear to have any purpose other than to distress the viewer as much as possible. The Man Called Horse scene right next to an international incident was silly and if Amin didn't sow his wife's body parts up in funny ways as most commentators have suggested, why pander to possibly racist myths? Most puzzling.<br /><br />I did however like the Scottish guys performance and the direction was reasonable. Amin was miscast but that is where we came in.</p></body></html>

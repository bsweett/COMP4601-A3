<meta name="summary" content="Good comedy gets old toward the end"></head><body><p>The repeating time loop, in which one experiences the same period of time indefinitely, is a familiar concept to science-fiction fans.  It provides fertile ground for a romantic comedy as well.  Bill Murray is a self-important weatherman who finds himself reliving Groundhog Day.  He goes through a number of stages, from disbelief through near-insanity to a calm acceptance, growing as a person along the way.  As much as I liked the concept and Bill Murray's performance, I found myself growing bored toward the end of the film.  Of course, repetition is unavoidable in a film of this type.  Indeed, it is the whole point of the movie.  Nevertheless, the filmmakers needed to make the repetition seem a little less...well, repetitious.  I still give it three stars, but screenwriter Danny Rubin and director Harold Ramis needed to find more for the actors to do.</p></body></html>

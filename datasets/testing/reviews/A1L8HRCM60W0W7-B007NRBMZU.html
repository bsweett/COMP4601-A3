<meta name="summary" content="THE METAPHYSICS BOGGLES EVEN MORE THAN THE DUD SCREENPLAY"></head><body><p>What did I just watch? A sci-fi thriller? A modern "horror" tale, as advertised? Or was this a semi-serious attempt at that "Simpsons" episode in which Homer creates a time machine out of a toaster and keeps altering his universe? Guess it doesn't really matter because whatever it was, it was fairly perplexing. <p>First, the central quasi-timetravel theme is so dense and doozy that it hogs about 1/3rd of the movie just to present itself. We are led to believe that an adolosecent possesses the mystic ability to get back into his childhood memory and restitch some key components that were too painful for him. <p>Fine and dandy, but the screenplay with which this is told is messy and unriveting. There are scenes of ragging (bullying, hazing) that just add very little to the overall texture of the movie. There's also a scene with Kutcher waking up in the buff with no memory of the girl in his bed last night, which is followed by a walk to the communal showers from where hot women with no clothing emerge. Sounded more like like a showcase rather than an important bit of script. <p>Third, the metaphysics are just plain questionable. How come Evan's personal diaries and notes remain unaffected when the rest of his world is warped into intended "Life, version 2.0"? Looks like we make up our own rules as we go along the film, which makes the minor sting of the "ultimate sacrifice" as numb and vague as the rest of the humorless ordeal.<p>Overall, perhaps a worthy ride if you're into insanely "different" themes but it's hard to care about this stuff and the actors in it.</p></body></html>

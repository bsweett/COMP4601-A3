This movie is represented as a fantasy adventure; however, it is not. The movie is about two middle school aged children, who develop a friendship and a world of imagination in which to go. The movie changes direction about two-thirds of the way through. These two factors combine to make the climax of the movie very sad indeed. With that being said, the movie was good in its way. A girl teaches a boy to use his imagination not only to have fun and relax, but to face the challenges of life. The girl and the boy become good friends.<br /><br />Thus the movie is about friendship, empathy, family, imagination and loyalty. The acting is good. Josh is a little wooden. Robb is delightful as the girl. The little sister was very good.  The CGI was restrained and well done. The plot is ok.<br /><br />The end is good. It is hard to figure out who this movie is targeted for. I thought it felt too young for an adult. High school kids wouldn't be interested.  One of the major characters dies in the movie. Although the death is off screen, younger children may be disturbed by it.</p></body></html>

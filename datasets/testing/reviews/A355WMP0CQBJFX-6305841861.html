<meta name="summary" content="DEAD BY DAWN IF YOU'RE LUCKY!!"></head><body><p>another one of my favorites, one of the best films out there. evil dead was great, and this sequal was almost just as good. these kinds of movies are the kinds that stand the test of time. they were hilarious and scary then, and not much has changed even now. whether you saw it then or you're a newcomer and saw it now. there are things you'll laugh about, find completely impossible, or just downright think it's stupid, but enjoyable. at the same time you still get those unexpected moments, those shocking scenes, and all that exaggerated blood and gore. wicked movie, but extremely worth every penny. my kind of movie no doubt. the setting is one of the scariest ones. takes place in a creepy old cabin in the middle of nowhere, with nothing but a pich black forest surrounding it. at night it comes alive and the fog swallows everything. this is some good stuff, and let's not forget bruce campbell, got to give the man credit where it's due. he's a great actor and these movies are are a success mainly because of  him. defenitly deserves all the props, and if you haven't seen it yet, you really should.</p></body></html>

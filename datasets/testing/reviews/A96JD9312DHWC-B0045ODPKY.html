<meta name="summary" content="Mining for Salt (identity wise anyhow)"></head><body><p>As the advertisement asks, "A you (firt name) Salt? Yes. Then you are a russian spy." There is a person saying that Jolie is working for another country, Jolie saying she has to make sure her loved ones are safe, and the world seeing chasing after her. As the plots begin to spin, you begin to wonder if anyone is who they say they are and who, exactly, Salt is. she is ruthless, that's for sure, and she knows her stuff. Still, she is an agent with a past and that past is something that mingles with some high profile people.<br /><br />Salt is one of those movies that hits the ground running and waits for you to catch up. For an adrenile movie it has something of a complex plot (meaning it is complex on a Hollywood standard but a C- when looked out outisde of action), and i think this helps it. In the beginning you actually see how hard things are for an agent, see how complex it is when you work as a supposed spy, and then have that bubble deflated for you. you also have love added into the equation, making things interesting.<br /><br />When you look at this movie, a lot of it does revolve around the notion of love. From the start this is explain and given as part of the character, and from that start you gage what is transpiring. I have to hand it to jolie on this job because she seems to hold her own on all fields and she does it with style and a bit of mystery to her. Considering her real life and the microscope she operates under, you can see just how well this is portrayed there.<br /><br />The action here is fast, is solid, and the ideas are good. The movie is a run, Lola, run movie with a lot of firepower, and there are positions of the plot map that make you say "cool." I like the way some things happen and the way Salt stays ahead, but the movie doesn't make her chasing people's total fools. They are not far behind and she seems ready, but a plot portion of the movie and the past explains this. And, again, you cannot for the love piece.<br /><br />As much as this is the same movie in some ways, it differs in some good ways as well. The way jolie gets to do things, interesting things, to get out is interesting to me as well. I liked the fact that we do not see bullets into a wall as some means to get out or shooting hundreds of people. We are also not given watered down ideas but have enough of a plot to work on today's terror system. Combine that with the man in her life and I took interest, sadness, love, revenge, and so much more out of moments here. It was a nice 5, provided you know what you are into here.<br /><br />Thank you.</p></body></html>

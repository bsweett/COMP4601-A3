Normally I am not into religious movies but this was not bad. If you are expecting a fast paced, action packed Indiana Jones treasure hunt kind of movie this probably is not the film for you but if you are looking for a suspenseful, dramatic and intellectual movie, give this one a try. It's visually beautiful and has great music. I liked the acting, liked the characters and loved the way it was filmed. I actually heard about the theories the book is based on years ago. As far as the religious meaning behind the movie or the debate of it's fact and fiction, I choose to remain neutral on the topic. I find it in poor taste when people preach about their religious beliefs in a review so I won't do that to anyone reading this. I choose instead to judge this movie on it's artistic value. It was an awesome work of art, had some great twists and turns, kept my attention and I would watch it again though I doubt I would buy it for my collection. This will never be an all-time favorite movie for me but it made me want to read the book and it was certainly worth watching!</p></body></html>

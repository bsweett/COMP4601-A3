<meta name="summary" content="A Truely Great Film!"></head><body><p>I had heard mixed reviews about the movie from sports fans so I held off seeing this film in the movies.  I am sorry I waited because it is an excellent film, deserving of all the accolades it received.  Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman are all excellent and play characters with a lot of depth.<br /><br />The supporting characters are good from the wannabees at Eastwood's gym who spend more time heckling a member named Houston than actually doing any real training, to Swank's pathetic "trailer park" family members.<br /><br />Note: possible spoiler ahead:<br /><br />The only issue I had with the film is the antics of the "dirty" female fighter who does things behind the referee's back (like in a pro wrestling match) but is still caught on tv and she is never charged with any crimes even though her antics go way beyond any dirty stuff I have seen at hockey matches where players were criminally charged.</p></body></html>

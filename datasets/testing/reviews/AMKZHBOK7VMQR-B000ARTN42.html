It turned out to be a much better movie for a lot of reasons. First and foremost the boxing sequences are realistic and compelling. Second Russell Crowe is absolutely convincing and credible as a man literally fighting to save his family from the ravages of the depression. Ron Howard did an amazing job on this film and it succeeds as a human interest story , an historical drama and as a great boxing film.  The supporting cast is great. A truly fine production.</p></body></html>

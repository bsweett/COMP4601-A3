<meta name="summary" content="The Shining"></head><body><p>Brilliant, creepy horror from Kubrick, with mesmerizing camera work and bizarre, arresting set pieces. Nicholson is a marvel to watch as his character evolves from a slightly odd but functioning adult to raving psychopath. Scatman Crothers is also memorable as the hotel's only other resident. Based on Stephen King's book, the film has Kubrick's slightly twisted genius all over it. Look for those wild tracking shots as Danny rides his tricycle indoors.</p></body></html>

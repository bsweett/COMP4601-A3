<meta name="summary" content="Bizarre, but a film worth watching."></head><body><p>Malcolm McDowell plays Alex; a young hooligan who finally gets caught at all his mischief when he accidentally kills one of his robbery victims. He spends time in prison, and then is given the option to participate in an experimental prisoner 'rehabilitation' program. The new treatment renders him physically incapable of violence of any kind, but takes away what many deem as a human 'moral choice'. It's a very strange movie, and makes its point in violent ways, but it does have a point to make. I like how the character comes 'full circle' when he ends up crawling to the home of one of his first victims. A tightly written screenplay with not an 'inch' of boredom. You'll have to get the popcorn, etc. ahead of time. You're not going to walk to the kitchen during any part of this bizarre, memorable film.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

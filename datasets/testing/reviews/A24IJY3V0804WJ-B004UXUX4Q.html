<meta name="summary" content="A family saga"></head><body><p>The ` Descendants" chronicles the struggle of a dysfunctional family trying to come in terms with a tragedy and a impending monumental decision. George Clooney is wonderful as he sheds his image of cool and tries to take charge of fatherhood and struggles to keep his family intact.<br />As Matt King ( Clooney) tries to face the death of his wife due to an accident  with his younger daughter Scottie ( Amara Miller) and cope with the rebelliousness of his teen daughter Alexandra. He also has to decide the sale of prime real estate in Hawaii to developer, and the sale is causing his family to become even more hostile. If this is not enough, he comes to realise that his comatose wife was having an affair behind his back. The movie is easy to watch and is lit by wonderful performances by Sid (Nick Krause), Alexandra's friend; Matthew Lillard as Brian, the wife's lover; Judy Greer as Brian's sweet-wife; Robert Forster as Matt's  father-in-law.<br />Alexander Payne, finding his form again after ` Sideways" allows all these people bare their emotions and act wonderfully while doing, amidst the backdrop of beautifully shot Hawaii.<br />Four stars. 4/12/2012</p></body></html>

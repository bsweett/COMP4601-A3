<meta name="summary" content="Good, but not like the original"></head><body><p>Saw 2 is not quite as good as the first one but it still does a pretty good job of pulling its own weight. Once again the ending is very unpredictable. The death traps are as good as ever, but it does not have the original taste that the first Saw movie has, but still a very entertaining movie to watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Suburbs Suck."></head><body><p>Virginia Woolf is frustrated by having to live in the suburbs instead of in her beloved London to the point of being suicidal - she later DOES commit suicide after the Germans bomb her London home to oblivion - thank you, Germans; Julianne Moore's 50's housewife is trapped in the suburbs with an entitled husband and an unpleasant neurotic child who grows up to be a failed impersonator of Marcel Proust and a torturer of Meryl Streep's character who lives in Greenwich Village but creates chores for herself that make her just as suburban as any housewife with busy work that has her circling the drain instead of reaching any higher plain.  Both Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore are better actresses than Meryl Streep and have bigger roles in this film as well.  I guess Mrs. Dalloway is a nonevent.  She does have an interestingly strange face - sometimes she looks Asian.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This One Redefines The Genre"></head><body><p>Hysterically funny comedies are trailblazers that redefine the genre and spawn a plethora of weak imitations.  Comedic pioneers include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A02TZ">Animal House</a> and the forever-irreverent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J07O">Caddyshack</a>.  Now joining these illustrious ranks is THE HANGOVER, a raunchy, ornery, in-your-face kneeslapper that blazes a new trail into the comedic badlands.  Centered around a bachelor trip to Vegas gone awry, this movie is not only hysterical, it's well-crafted and delivered by an extraordinary ensemble of actors.  There are no weak links here.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha all bring their own unique talents to their roles as four pals celebrating one last guys' night out before one of them (Bartha) gets hitched on Sunday.  Of course, their first night on the town goes astray once their drinks are laced with Rohypnol; they all wake up on Saturday morn with no memory of what took place the night before, and worse still, they've lost the groom-to-be.  Their subsequent "quest" to find their pal drives the engine of this comedy, as their wacky adventures have them crossing paths with the likes of a delightfully insane Ken Jeong to Mike Tyson (playing himself).  THE HANGOVER then rushes to its whirlwind climax, culminating in the four friends finally taking a look at pics from a digital camera of their forgotten Friday night--a hysterically funny ending to an outrageous comedy gem.<br />--D.

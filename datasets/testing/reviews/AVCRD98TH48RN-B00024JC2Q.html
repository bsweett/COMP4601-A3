If anybody needed another example that Owen Wilson cannot act and is not funny other than the very lame "Shanghai Knights" then look no further than this film.  He reminds me of a less intelligent Dennis Miller, always trying to come across as cute but without the wit.  Blah!  Then there is the flimsy and altogether predictable and flat script.  It made me wonder how on Earth the producers managed to get so many "name" actors for bit roles.  When the drug-deal story goes stale(as it frequently does) Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are called upon to improvise by wearing ridiculous costumes and managing to sneak their way into various locations.  The script even calls for the obligatory passing of the torch from the original actors who starred in the television show by having them hand over the keys to that very cool car.  The best thing about the show was the car, not the acting or the predictable tough-guy dialogue.  "Let's come up with a new movie idea based on an antiquated television show!"  Sound familiar.  Here it is again.  The only redeeming factor in the entire film(other than Carmen Electra in a cameo as a cheerleader, ouch!) is Ben Stiller.  He seems to be the only person concerned with making this once popular iconic television show into a parody, which is the only sensible thing to do.  He has a few outright hilarious scenes and plays a few other characters that are crazy and quotable.  It's just too bad no one else shared his energy or his vision while making this otherwise dumb film.  As far as Snoop Dogg playing the character Huggy Bear...hoodlums waxing intellectual has been done before.  His presence is wasted in every other scene with stilted dialogue and unbelievable situations.  This film is a waste of time for anyone who isn't a Ben Stiller fan.  As for his fans I recommend renting this film and not buying it, then picking up his other recent film "Duplex" which is funnier by leaps and bounds.  Later.</p></body></html>

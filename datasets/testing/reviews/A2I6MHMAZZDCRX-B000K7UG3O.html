<meta name="summary" content="Launches Fun"></head><body><p>Trip (Matthew McConaughey) has a wonderful life.  He's handsome, loves his job, and any time he wants to be dumped, he has the perfect plan.  He just takes the girlfriend home and lets her find out he still lives with Mom and Dad (Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw).<br /><br />Of course, any intelligent man would still live with these parents.  His mom cleans his room from top to bottom while he's in the shower every morning and always makes him a gourmet breakfast, something she doesn't even do for her husband.<br /><br />His parents aren't as happy with the arrangement.  In desperation, they turn to Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker).  Paula makes her living helping "launch" guys from their parent's house to their own pad.  She has a step by step approach that helps the guy build self-esteem to carry them to their own life.  But what happens when she starts to fall for Trip?<br /><br />Odds are you can probably guess most of this movie just from my plot description.  So the job of a movie such as this is to keep the audience entertained so we forget we already know where we're going.  Here, the movie really shines.  Part of the fun is watching Paula at work.  We know what she's up to, so several of the scenes become a joke as we watch Trip fall for each "step" hook, line, and sinker.  To top this, there are several genuinely funny scenes, such as the scene that takes all the characters to play paintball.  Even when the movie gets more serious in the final third, the overall tone is lighthearted.<br /><br />Helping things along is the great cast.  Everyone is having fun, and it keeps the tone light and the audience engaged.  Special note goes to Zooey Deschanel.  She plays Paula's moody, brooding roommate and is easily the funniest character in the movie.<br /><br />No, this movie is not "great cinema."  But it never set out to be.  It is a fun romantic comedy that will keep everyone who watches it entertained.  What else matters?</p></body></html>

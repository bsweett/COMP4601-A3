As the years pass, Plainview becomes a wealthy oilman, traveling the countryside with his son, buying land and building oil wells.  When he buys one farm, he begins an antagonistic relationship with a young preacher.<br /><br />I didn't "get" this movie.  I know critics praised it for being a great piece of art but for me it was two and a half long hours of monotonous tedium.  The only thing interesting about it was the soundtrack which created an eerie, ominous mood, making me believe it was building to some exciting action.  But the plot, such as it is, just rambles through the years and we learn nothing of the oilman's background or his thoughts  beyond the oilfield.  We don't know why he's so angry and cold.<br /><br />There is minimal dialogue and when people do speak, there is no emotional connection (except for Plainview and his odd son, but even that deteriorates - and again, we don't know why).  The young preacher wasn't believable at all; he seemed weak and silly, not at all an equal adversary for the heartless Plainview.  No one in the cast was sympathetic or interesting and I gave up caring about them.</p></body></html>

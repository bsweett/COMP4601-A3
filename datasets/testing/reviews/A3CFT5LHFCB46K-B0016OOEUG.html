It's the secret of my charm.""></head><body><p>With a well-rounded cast, Oscar winning cinematography and a beautiful but haunting music score, Laura is one of the best  film noirs ever made, a definite classic (Possible plot spoilers ahead). <p>Laura Hunt (A beautiful Gene Tierney) is a manager at an advertisement agency. Famous, talented and of course attractive, she is adored and respected by everyone. But when she is murdered, everyone who was close to her is suspected. Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson (A dull but effective Dana Andrews) is put on the case. Throughout the film, we are given the impression that McPherson doesn't think too well of women, referring to them as `Dames' or `Dolls'. As he delves further, he finds he falling in love with Laura's portrait. As it turns out, Laura is very much alive. The problem now is for McPherson to find out who was murdered and, more importantly, who was the murderer.  <p>Clifton Webb gave the film's best performance as columnist/ writer Waldo Lydecker  (Murder is his favorite subject). He never admits it, but seems to be in love with Laura. He has given her many gifts and gave her the boost to become the success that she was. He also believes that only he is right for her, though considerably beyond her age. But maybe Laura just was using and manipulating him to rise to the top. Waldo never seems to believe this and prevents Laura from having other relationships with men. He also is a smart alec, claiming that he writes not with a pen, but "...with a Goose Quill, dipped in venom". He is definitely the most colorful character in the movie and got an Oscar nomination for his work. <p>What ever you do, don't give away the ending. It is revealed who the murderer was. It is both the most likely and the least likely suspect. But it doesn't matter who it is, really. For this is still a must see movie. It's also, for the MTV generation people, rather short (88 Minutes). <p>Since this movie is not yet out on DVD, fans will have to go with the VHS edition, which includes the Original Theatrical Trailer.</p></body></html>

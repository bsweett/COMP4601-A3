<meta name="summary" content="Not funny like previous ones but certainly charming"></head><body><p>If Cars is good, which I hope it is cause trailers don't make it look good, then Monsters Inc is probably my least favorite Pixar film. But of course like the saying goes, it's not my favorite but it's still good. It just doesn't have the hilarity of Toy Story 2, the amazing technical ability of Finding Nemo or the energy of the Incredibles. In the end, Monsters Inc is like films such as Bambi or Dumbo, they're not funny but they still entertain us regardless.<br /><br />In the world of Monstropolis, their power comes not from traditional electricity but from childrens' screams turned into energy. So we have "scarers", monsters who use a vast supply of doors that lead into a child's bedroom and literally scare the kids to get the screams. Only problem is kids are getting really hard to scare. Top scarer Sulley working late one night finds a door left behind, and a kid. And monsters have been conditioned to believe kids are dangerous so he tries avoiding her only she's really attached to him.<br /><br />Only he can't really bring her back because Sulley's rival Randall is after her. Helping out Sulley is Mike, his assistant, and figuring out how to bring "Boo" back to her own room without being detected. This leads to an impressive animation sequence where they see just where all the doors are.<br /><br />The film may not be as funny as previous entries(or for that matter, the next 2) but it's certainly got a warmth and heart to it, something definately lacking in today's animation films. Pretty much bringing all the charm almost single-handedly is "Boo", the girl who ends up in Monster world. Speaking in baby talk and a word now and then, she's certainly the kind of child you'd want to have. Billy Crystal plays Mike and he's got that manic voice going on that Robin Williams did in Aladdin(and again in Robots).<br /><br />One thing that is a sight to watch is the technical aspect of the animation. One scene early on when Mike and Sulley walk to work certainly looks vibrant and colorful and Sulley's hair looks great plus the aforementioned "door room". The humans are certainly looking better too, the Toy Story humans definately looked odd but they've gotten better, with their best probably being their last film, the Incredibles.<br /><br />The only one I'm missing for Pixar films on DVD is Toy Story 2 and of course that comes out boxing day(and obviously Cars but that's not even in theatres out, here's hoping it's good) but this film certainly is good, even if you have a child(ren) or not.</p></body></html>

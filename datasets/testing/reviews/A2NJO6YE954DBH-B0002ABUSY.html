<meta name="summary" content="Dawn of the Dead-ish is a pretty solid zombie movie"></head><body><p>To my surprise I really liked "Dawn of the Dead," even in this no holds barred unrated director's cut.  Like many others I considered George A. Romero's original version of "The Night of the Living Dead" to be the classic low budget horror film of all time and I also have a strong sense of affection for the original version of "Dawn of the Dead," with its wry commentary on American consumerism.  So I was wary of a remake, especially given that director Zack Snyder was a feature film novice and writer James Gunn wrote both of the Scooby Doo movies.  But by the end of this film I was grooving to "Down with the Sickness" during what is one of the most unsettling end credits ever.  This had to be one film where everybody stayed in the theater until the light came on and then thought twice before they went outside to their cars, especially if they went to the late show (like a true horror fan ever goes out before dark to see a movie).<br /><br />The basic story is the same as the original.  A group of people fleeing from the zombies get into a shopping mall, where they find another group of people, security guards, who are not really happy to see them.  So they have to hole up in the mall while the number of zombies outside trying to get in grows and grows.  Ana (Sarah Polley) a nurse meets up with Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a cop.  They then find Michael (Jake Weber), Andre (Mekhi Phifer), and his pregnant wife, Luda (Inna Korobkina).  They barely get into the mall ahead of a small group of zombies and then butt heads with CJ (Michael Kely), and his and his sidekicks Terry (Kevin Zegers) and Bart (Michael Barry).  Later on a truck shows up driven by tough lady Norma (Jayne Eastwood), Frank (Matt Frewer) and his daughter Nicole (Lindy Booth), sexy Monica (Kim Poirier), smartass Steve (Ty Burrell), and good ol' Tucker (Boyd Banks).<br /><br />Basically the movie is divided into two parts.  Most of the movie the group is just trying to keep things together inside the mall.  Then in the final act they make a break for it.  The best bits are in that first section and what helps during the great escape attempt is that these people are not too stupid, which is quite an accomplishment for a horror film where stupidity often runs rampant.  In the mall there are two intense scenes, the first involving the decision to kill one of their members who has been bit, and the second involving Luda going into labor (yes, what happens then is even worse than you can imagine).  In between there are some moments of black comedy as they find way to kill time and kill zombies.  Across the street at Andy's Gun Shop poor Andy (Bruce Bohne) is on the roof, all alone, able to communicate with the mall rats by writing messages on boards.  There is some nice pathos with Andy to go with the black comedy of the games he plays with his new friend Kenneth.  Of course, there are also a couple of memorable muzak moments involving grotesque irony.<br /><br />Because this is a 2004 film the zombies have to be seriously upgraded.  Forget the lumbering ghouls of the original films, because these zombies are not only faster but not as stupid.  There are also a lot more of them and the film has a couple of chilling shots and sequences where we get to see wall to wall zombies (or the entire parking lot of the mall filled with zombies at night).  I approve of the changes because it allows Snyder to up the pacing and the horror.  There is also a corresponding upgrade of what the living at able to throw at the dead that would make ol' Hank Hill pretty happy.  Add to this the effective use of the "Aliens" rule, which is that as long as what you are shooting with your big gums are not human, you can blow them to bits and the blood and gore does not really count.  You know what special effects are like today and there are enough zombies getting blown away for everyone to find one or two demises that appeal to their inner warped little child.  Fortunately the three principles, Polley, Rhames and Weber, are all decent people, even in the face of the end of the world as we know it, so you do not feel like you are wallowing in the depths of human degredation (besides the flesh eating zombies).<br /><br />However, given what works in the film several of the DVD bonus features are pretty lame in comparison.  There is "The Lost Tape" that reveals Andy's terrifying last days and basically turns that interesting character into a joke.  Equally painful is the "Special Bulletin" segment, where nobody comes closer in terms of performance or effectiveness to what we get in the opening credits as bits and pieces of information about the collapses of society flash by.  In contrast, the beginning of "Raising the Dead," where we see a hundred extras lined up in zombie makeup, is better than those other two bits.  Then we get the director and prosthetic makeup designer David LeRoy Anderson delineating the differences between Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 zombies in terms of makeup that makes it seem like a totally reasonable way of approaching the universe.  There are other features on the special effects (e.g., "Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads") and a commentary track with director Zack Snyder and producer Eric Newman where they both seem rather pleased with the result, and while this remake of "Dawn of the Dead" is a lot slicker than its competition in the 21st century zombie movie category (to wit, "28 Days Later"), it does have its moments.</p></body></html>

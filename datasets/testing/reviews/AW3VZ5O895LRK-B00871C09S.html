<meta name="summary" content="Another Hitchcock Gem!"></head><body><p>Jimmy Stewart is a reporter confined to his high rise New York apartment building because he is recovering from a broken leg.  Grace Kelly is his fiance.  She comes over to help him with his recovery, although he is crankiness personified because of his condition. However, things look up when Stewart finds himself more and more engrossed by what is going on at his neighbor's apartment in another high rise, facing his.  The neighbor is played by Raymond Burr and Stewart starts to worry that Burr may be planning to do something awful to his wife.  This is a real nailbiter of a movie because Stewart is hugely limited on what he can do to help by being confined to his wheelchair. We are back in the 1950s so a phone is his only instrument of communication.  Also, Kelly is never there when the most suspicious things with Burr occur so Stewart's going to have trouble making the police believe him.  Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this is an extremely satisfying exploration of a man's bored voyeurism turning into a rollycoaster of a nightmare. Stewart and Kelly starred in several Hitchcock films. Stewart excels at playing the regular ok guy for whom life turns nightmarish in Hitchcock's films.  Kelly excels at playing the beautiful blonde society woman.  She is unaccustomed to crime interrupting her perfect life yet she can face crime with cool aplomb. For those who have only ever seen Burr in his heroic tv roles, they will be surprised to discover that he usually played dark or villainous roles in his earlier movie career.</p></body></html>

Historic."></head><body><p>Formed in 1948, the modern state of Israel has survived in the midst of her enemies by divine Providence and the support of the United States and Great Britain. Otherwise, she surely would have been overwhelmed by the forces of evil which threaten her even today.<br /><br />Members of the youngest generation may not realize that terrorism is not new, it has been with us for decades and nowhere more painfully than in the Middle East.<br /><br />"Munich" is about terrorism, hatred, revenge, and survival. Having withstood the slaughter of eleven athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972, Israel retaliates by mounting clandestine operations to punish the twelve complicit Arabs. Israeli leadership is intent upon extracting justice by punishing her foes; an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.<br /><br />Spielberg gets it right. The film is dark, threatening, thrilling, and suspenseful. Politics and war make for unlikely bedfellows and there are surprises and plot twists which add to the suspense. In Munich, nothing is certain but death.</p></body></html>

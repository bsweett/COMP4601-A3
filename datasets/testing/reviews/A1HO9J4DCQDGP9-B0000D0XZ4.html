I wasn't expecting too, to be honest; it had so much negative criticism that when I watched it on SKY last night I was not expecting anything but a pile of pants.<br /><br />It actually turned out to be quite good, very intelligent for a "super hero" movie and very well acted by all concerned.<br /><br />Okay so it didn't follow the Hulk comic book we all know and love but who cares?  It was a GOOD movie, fun, moving, humorous with spectacular special effects.  I even liked the way Ang Lee sectioned the screens off into blocks so that we could see several perspectives, I thought that was neat and quite clever.<br /><br />The plot was marginally more complex than most but then THIS is an Ang Lee film so with action you get intelligence which is a rare commodity these days and should be savoured like a good quality port if you get my drift?<br /><br />Eric Bana as the scientist Bruce Banner was a good choice of actor, and Nick Nolte was brilliant as the deranged scientist whose mutated genes he passed on to his unsuspecting son during conception.<br /><br />We have the delectable Sam Elliot (even with grey hair!) as the ruthless military man Ross trying to kill the Hulk, his estranged daughter Betty, played by the versatile actress Jennifer Connolly (who is in love with the Hulk's human persona, Eric and of course a baddie in the form of Talbot played by the unknown actor Josh Lucas a somewhat supercilious but ambitious young man who gets bounced around like a rubber ball by a very, very cross Hulk and meats a sticky end in the best comic book tradition.<br /><br />This is a fairly action packed film, with lots of great and fun special effects, the mutated dog fight with the Hulk is great, and a frothing mouthed enraged poodle trying to get at Betty in her car is totally tongue in cheek but very well done.  I also liked the San Francisco scene with the Hulk ripping up the road as he runs UNDER it and the domino effect of the cars he sends hurtling down San Francisco's steep streets, a sweet moment in the film I have to say!<br /><br />And as for all those critics who have complained about how unrealistic this film is, erm, excuse me, this is just a fantasy film and when you are making fantasy come to life on celluloid you can over step the boundaries of physics, just simply because you can!<br /><br />We also get a cameo by the original Hulk Lou Ferrigno who has a walk on part as a security guard; I like the fact that Ang Lee acknowledged the past as well as the future because I remember and still love the original Hulk series, as cheesy and as dated as it is now!<br /><br />All in all Ang Lee did a great job with this film and I don't care what anyone else says, it's worth watching and its worth getting on DVD because the first time around you don't get to see every little gem he has put into this movie.<br /><br />Some movies you have to think about when you watch them others you can watch and forget, with this version of The Hulk you have to think so using your brain cells is a must which I know is REALLY hard for some members of the moving going general public, must be all the "E's" in the butter popcorn they are eating is all I can say.</p></body></html>

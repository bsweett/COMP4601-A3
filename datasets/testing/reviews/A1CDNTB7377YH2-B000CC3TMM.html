<meta name="summary" content="Action Packed!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best action films I have seen in years.  Jason Stratham does an excellent job of improving on his character that we saw in the dismal original film and the director has made a movie that is never boring and has some of the best fight scenes I have seen in a movie ever!<br /><br />Stratham is super likable as a driver for a politician's young son.  The chemistry between the two is excellent, reminicent of Ricky Schroeder & John Voigt in The Champ.  Stratham promises the boy that he will never let anyone ever hurt him.  The audience starts to wonder if he can keep that promise after the boy is almost kidnapped and then finally kidnapped.<br /><br />Stratham makes impossible escape after another and uses some wicked fighting skills to track down the boy before something bad happens.  The beginning of the movie is reminicent of Denzel Washington's Man on Fire with Matthew Bodine playing a similar father character to Marc Anthony's character in that flick.  The difference is that in this movie, Bodine is just a bad father who has neglected his family as opposed to Anthony's evil intentions in the other flick.<br /><br />Some of the escapes will have you shaking your head but the movie is so good that you will ignore those issues.</p></body></html>

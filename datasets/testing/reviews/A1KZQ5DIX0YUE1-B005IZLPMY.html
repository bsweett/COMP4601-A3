<meta name="summary" content="Okay, DC Needs to Wake Up..."></head><body><p>I love comics. Always have, always will. I doubt that anyone could beat me in Batman trivia. Or Green Lantern. Or Swamp Thing. Anything Darkhawk.... Okay, so DH is Marvel. Anyway. What I have always loved in comics is man's ability to overcome enormous tribulations without relying on so called 'super powers'. Knowing this, you can imagine how bad I wanted to see Captain America. Despite the fact that I am a DC fanboy.<br /><br />Marvel's latest addition to what will be the Avenger's film is a knock out of the park. The sense of the Cap before the super-soldier program is amazing. There's this 80-pound version of Chris Evans and he's the best. Loyal and morally strong, with a love of the American ideals. The transformation into a super soldier is amazing; he is shown 'over-using' his new body and all but trips himself up because he actually realize he's running faster on foot than the cars drive around him. His innocent patriotism becomes an unstoppable force, and it makes you believe that one man can indeed make a difference.<br /><br />I have to give a nod to Alan Silvestri's score for the film. It strikes a strong central theme that fits the balance between patriotism and honest strength and it sounds authentic to the mid-40's. Well done, good sir.<br /><br />Cinematography is marvelous. Together with the stages and authentic vehicles and storefronts, we actually feel that we've been engaged with WWII hanging over our heads.<br /><br />The BD is just as awe-inspiring. We have the Holy Grail of sound - a 7.1 Sound track; it's only the 2nd I've ever seen. We get several featurettes, all showing various technical tid-bits and it is not the same point-counting drivel some folk have thrown together on DVD or BD. They manage to provide the tech talk with their own appreciation of the source material. There's a short film featuring Agent Coulson which demands automatic laughter at the most unsuspected details. Worth the $25 of the Blu-Ray 2-disc. It's gonna be a classic, mark my words.<br /><br />I'm watching the film now with the commentary. Already it seems less 'stuffy' than most; a mixture of technical talk with fond memories.  >>>EDIT: the commentary is actually pretty fun stuff, pointing out Easter eggs and hinting towards things to come. Alas, they provided no commentary on the post-credits scene. Not that they needed to; it pretty much speaks for itself.>>><br /><br />But the best part is, we have seen some bit of what Marvel has in store for us. The Avenger's film is going to break a few benchmarks in modern film making. DC may have the Animated features each a tight and solid entry for the DCU, but beyond the Batman franchise, and possibly Green Lantern, DC just doesn't match the steam behind Marvel's power. I'm still holding out for a Flash feature film.<br /><br />I'll probably catch some flames from this review. But I have to be honest and objectionable. Marvel is reminding me of a time in my youth when I didn't know DC Comics existed. And the Avengers were one of my favourite titles way back then. I'm glad to see anything positive come from anything comic-book related. Makes the years of living as a geek somewhat tolerable. Almost.</p></body></html>

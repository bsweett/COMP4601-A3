<meta name="summary" content="Popcorn movie that is both satisfying and disappointing."></head><body><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator role is unquestionably the role that put him on the map, and this third installment has been a long time coming (12 years after part 2). Is it as good as the pervious 2 movies? Right off the bat, I will say no. While most action fans will love the overlong chase sequences and fights, diehard fans of the original will see this as a letdown.<p>Apparently, the end of the second movie was wrong. Judgement Day was not stopped, it was merely postponed. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is once again confronted with the future when a female terminator (a very sexy female terminator) is sent back to kill him, since he is to become the future resistance leader, and his future lieutenant, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). The new female terminator, the T-X, is stronger, faster, and miles more advanced than the T-1000 from Terminator 2. True to form, Arnie returns as the original T-100 terminator (a different model, though)  to protect these two, who are important to the survival of the human race. <p>While the ideas put forth on paper are good, they seem insubstantial in the execution. The first two movies balanced action with a solid storyline, while the third seems like a by-the-numbers action movie with a story added in for effect. It  doesn't have the same look, feel, or emotional impact of the first two movies. Arnold is heavy on the one-liners here, but his performance lacks any substance, and comes across as wooden and annoyingly heavy on the self-parody.<p>Terminator 3 is not a bad movie, in fact there were many elements that I quite liked. But as a Terminator movie, it fails, if for no other reason is because it had a lot to live up to after Terminator 2. The secret to appreciating Terminator 3 is to lower your expectations, and no go into it thinking of the previous movies.</p></body></html>

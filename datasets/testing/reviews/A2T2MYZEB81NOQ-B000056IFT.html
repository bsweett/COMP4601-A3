<meta name="summary" content="Cool on Earth, cool on Mars, he is Ah-Nold!"></head><body><p>This is among the coolest Arnold movies I've ever seen. It follows Doug Quaid, played by Ah-nold, a man who is obsessed with Mars. He is being decieved by a villainess named Lori who is pretending to be his wife. Soon, he finds out all sorts of things and is getting into fights involving guns, knives, fists, feet and even explosive weapons. There is a man on Mars, which he soon gets to, named Vilos Cohaggen, who is an evil tyrant and keeps all the air for Mars and its people to live on locked up and bottled. Doug soon finds out all sorts of things, meets his real wife, Melina, a beautiful woman who's also a warrior, then the challenge begins. Will Doug ever find out the truth about who or what he is? Will Vilos be stopped? Will Mars ever be livable again? Find out when you see this wonderful masterpiece. Oh, and I suggest you buy the special edition. Doug & Lori are my two favorite characters. Hero & villain, male & female. Done.</p></body></html>

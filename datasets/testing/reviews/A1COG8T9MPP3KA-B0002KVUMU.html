With that aside, it was a fun film if you leave your brain at the door. The character of Van Helsing himself was super cheesy. He is like a cross between Michael Douglas in "Romancing The Stone" and Indiana Jones. This is a movie that should be seen while on the big screen as it will lose half of its effectiveness on a TV screen. The brides of Dracula stole the show while the Dracula character himself was every stupid cliche of Dracula possible. 2 and 1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The definitive film of the 1990s"></head><body><p>&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is a drunken romp through almost every conceivable film genre. In its &quot;chapters&quot; one can detect Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns, Kurosawa's Samurai epics, John Ford's manly action dramas, the New Wave, 70s schlock, blaxploitation, and, of course, &quot;Saturday Night Fever.&quot;<p>It is the definitive Tarantino film and the definitive film of the 1990s, and is far more than just a genre piece, but a commentary on cinema itself. Not a moment of QT's spectacular stunt would have worked without the healthy doses of irony and humor injected into the script, which is one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century.<p>This movie is burned into my brain. I don't need to watch it, as I can quote the dialogue along with the characters. &quot;PF&quot; is not for everyone; it is profane and violent. Either you love this movie, as I do, or you hate it. There is no in between. I don't think Tarantino would have had it any other way.</p></body></html>

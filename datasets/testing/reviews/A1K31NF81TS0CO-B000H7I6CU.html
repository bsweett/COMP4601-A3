Disney has done it again!<br /><br />I borrowed this one from my local video rental service and was quite pleased with the total value and extra materials on this one.  A nice story about not "burning your bridges" as our hero did at the beginnig of the story.  But by the end he learns his lesson, and comes out on top.<br /><br />Nice little story about Route 66 as well.<br /><br />Kind of makes me want o rent an RV, and drive down Route 66.<br /><br />Where were all the people?<br /><br />MC White said:  Well, a'iiiight!</p></body></html>

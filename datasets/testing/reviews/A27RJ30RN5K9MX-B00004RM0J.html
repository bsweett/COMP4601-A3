They are being forced out of their homes by a local land developer that wants to build a country club. The only way to save their homes is to come up with enough money to pay off all the back taxes their families owe. Unfortunately, it is a feat that is practically impossible to accomplish. However, The Goonies discover a map that is supposed to lead to the buried treasure of the legendary &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Willie. Determined to keep their homes, the group sets off on a quest to find the rich stuff. Little do they know, that the beginning of the hunt leads to the basement of the local crime family The Fratelis. Now with the Fratelis hot on their tails, they must overcome numerous obstacles and booby traps to find the loot. <p>Sean Astin who is known for his role as Sam in the Lord of the Ring films, offers an outstanding performance as Mikey - the leader of the Goonies. He is the believer of the group and has always loved pirates - especially &quot;One - Eyed&quot; Willie. Johnathan Key Quan plays Data, who is the creative one of the group. He is obsessed with making wacky inventions and none of them work. Corey Feldman is great as Mouth. Mouth is a smart aleck whose mouth always gets the group in trouble. Jeff Cohen probably offers the film's best performance with his portrayal of Chunk. He is the main reason why the film has become such a fan favorite. Chunk is the most entertaining character by far. His constant whining, food cravings, and &quot;truffle shuffle&quot; will have you laughing for the majority of the film. Mikey's older brother Brand ( Josh Brolin), his girlfriend Andi ( Keri Green), and her best friend Stef ( Martha Plimpton) are also great as they come along for the ride. Troy Perkins ( Steve Antin) is the rich and spoiled bully that makes it his mission to terrorize the Goonies. He also has a thing for Andi and is in constant battle with Brand for her affection. The Frateli crime family is great. Mama Frateli (Anne Ramsey) will give you the creeps. Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi play the Frateli brothers Francis and Jake. Their constant bickering and other antics will make you laugh. Then there is Sloth. Sloth is their brother that is disfigured and possesses superhuman strength. They keep him chained in the basement. Sloth however is my favorite character and has a heart that matches the size of his love for Baby Ruth's! The relationship between him and Chunk is very touching.<p>The Goonies is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it maybe a dozen times, and I still love it just as much. Richard Donner does an excellent job directing the vast array of talent in the film. Steven Spielberg crafts an amazing tale of friendship and determination set in extraordinary circumstances. The characters that pave the road for the story are by far the best thing about the film. The visuals in this movie are beautifully done. The underground caverns, the booby traps, the pirate ship, and the treasure all give the film a sense of authenticity when dealing with the pirate genre. <p>The DVD is outstanding. It contains deleted scenes that include a hilarious convienient store scene and the infamous octopus scene. The commentary is the best feature. It brings back all the Goonies and shows them in the booth. You get to see Data, Chunk, Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Stef, and Andi all grown up. It is great to hear what they have to say about working with each other, the characters that they played, and the movie in general. The movie itself and the amazing DVD make it a must own!</p></body></html>

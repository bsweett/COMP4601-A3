[The changing scenes are a distraction; this is a movie not a puzzle.] His job is to kill wolves near the settlement to protect the workers. [What attracts them?] Men board an airplane to leave for vacation (or rotation). Alwin wants quiet; he remembers his past. There is turbulence from a storm. There is noise before the crash. Alwin awakes in the snow and finds the crashed plane. There are survivors, some are wounded and die. [What is the point to this scene?] Another man laughs. Seven are left. They must start a fire, then walk south. They won't be easily found. [The language may be realistic but is overdone.] A wolf shows up to scavenge the dead. [Should they leave the crash site?] One man bleeds from a wolf bite. Is that wolf part of a pack? They might attack if they have a den nearby.<br /><br />There is conflict among the men. [The darkness detracts from story.] The men joke over their situation. More wolves show up. They keep a fire going. A wolf attacks but is driven off. Daylight reveals dead bodies. They decide to head for the trees. They collect wallets for the families. The talk tells about their characters. Alwin searches the wreckage. "God bless these men." Wolves attack a straggler; he bleeds out. Dusk brings the wolves. "They're all around us!" A fire is lit just in time. "It worked." Alwin has a way to use a shotgun shell against a wolf. "I'm not scared." They hear the growl of a wolf. Then a wolf attacks! The men kill it, then hear the howls from the pack. They will cook and eat it. The wolves howl again.<br /><br />They continue to move out and find a refuge. The high altitude has an effect on a man. Alwin remembers his past as a child. There is a storm with high winds. One man doesn't wake up. They are near a river and devise a way to escape down a cliff with an improvised rope. One man has a problem. They continue to walk by the river. [No compass to guide them?] One man wants to rest. Is he tired of life? The two continue to walk. Two wolves approach and the men run. One falls into the fast-flowing river and is caught. Alwin expresses his frustration then continues to walk through the trees. He pauses, then hears a growl from wolves. "Once more into the fray." Will you be surprised by the ending? [Was this movie a too subtle story of the effect of the economic depression of workers?]<br /><br />You can blame the producer, director, screenwriter, and the author of the original short story for this movie. It is not so much bad as not good. You may be sorry you spent two hours watching this movie. I understand that if you survive a plane crash you should remain near the wreck as it is more visible from any search plane. A smoky fire is a signal for help. This could have been titled "Jaws in the Woods". It is another horror story. This production company could have used somebody to critique their plot before they implemented it. Or whatever they use to plan a production. I heard the name "Alwin" but the credits say "Ottway". They needed to carry a pistol whenever you travel in a wild country. You never know.</p></body></html>

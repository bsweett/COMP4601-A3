The film, though filled with action, also has an intelligence to it, and a slow, methodical style that is characteristic of the good science fiction movies of the era that ended with Star Trek II. Space explorers crash-land on an unknown planet, struggle to find food and water, and then encounter a band of mute humans, and then the dominant species on the planet: apes. It was a mirror to race relations in the 1960s, and also a reflection of the clash between scientific and religious thought on the origin of our species, and finally also a speculative tale of man's own fate, should mankind not master the worst parts of its nature.</p></body></html>

I had been sitting on actually seeing this film for a while now, despite really wanting to see it.  I finally got around to seeing this the other night, and I must say that I approach this review with equal parts respect and bewilderment.<br /><br />The film is very good, but it misses greatness in my eyes.<br /><br />`District 9' references a slum that houses aliens that have landed in Johannesburg and have been populating the area for several decades.  Their mother-ship hovers ominously in the horizon, reminding the humans that the aliens are still there.  The humans have segregated the aliens, confining them to a small and disgusting area and have regarded them as nothing but trash, referring to them as `prawns'; a derogatory term used to label them bottom-feeders.  On the outset of the film we are told, in documentary form, that the aliens are about to be evicted and moved to another location.  Head of this particular assignment is Wikus Van De Merwe, a na?ve and slightly odd young man whose father-in-law obviously favors him (but doesn't truly care for him).  While serving eviction notices and checking for illegal weapons, Wikus stumbles upon a device harvesting fluids that the aliens have been working on for twenty years.  That devise infects Wikus and soon he finds himself morphing into one of the aliens.  His department tries to use him as a test experiment and when he escapes they do what they can to track him down and cover up their own negligence.  Soon he is a fugitive with nowhere to turn but the one place he doesn't want to be a part of, District 9.<br /><br />The film is smarter than your average science fiction film in that it actually roots for a human core, something that can connect it to our world and speak to a deeper message.  In fact, it attains what it is searching for, especially on the surface.  `District 9' is absorbing and provocative, and that is a great asset to have within this genre, for it sets it apart and makes the audience take notice.  The action sequences are outstanding and the visual effects are tremendous (I prefer these authenticated visuals to `Avatar's cartoonesque appearance).  And yet, with such a sharply conceived idea (contrasting alien treatment with the apartheid) the film lacks the layers it needed to make this feel more human.  I'm tired of the whole idea that evil is one-note; that it is without levels of emotion.  In `District 9' it is apparent that humans are selfish and mean and aliens are misunderstood and kindhearted.  Even after being completely stepped on and stabbed in the back by a human, one of the aliens refuses to leave him alone in the sight of danger.<br /><br />`District 9' is far too black and white for its own good.<br /><br />Despite this flaw (ugh, why did it have to be there), this film is really well thought out and expertly crafted.  Director/writer Neill Blomkamp is one to watch for, since he really has a handle on this thing.  He has created a shockingly sincere and beautifully unique science fiction film that shows extreme promise for the young director (he's only six years older than me and look at where he is in his life!!!).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Connelly anchors the movie with her performance and yes theres another little kid who sees things"></head><body><p>Jennifer Connelly (House of Sand and Fog, Dark City) plays Dahlia, a mother who is moving her daughter Ceci into an apartment building on Roosevelt Island and she is also in a custody battle with her husband, played by Dougary Scott (Mission:Impossible 2, Engima) who wants Ceci to stay in the New Jersey area. Connelly and her daughter get a tour of the place by Mr. Murray, a conniving and convincing John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights, The Aviator). Connelly enroles her daughter into a school two blocks away from the place and everything seems to be ok but things start to happen when water starts to drip from the upstairs apartment into hers. There seems to be a backstory to that apartment and Connelly's daughter picks up an imaginary friend along the way which could lead to some answers. What you'd expect from the Author of The Ring...another story involving a paranoid woman and a creepy kid seeing things but Connelly's performance anchors the movie along with the help of the supporting cast including Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) as her Lawyer and Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects, The Constant Gardener). Also starring Camryn Manheim (The Practice, The 10th Kingdom) and Mums. Surely better then The Ring 2 and The Skeleton Key combined.</p></body></html>

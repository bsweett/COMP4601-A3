<meta name="summary" content="Ribs, guts and flesh torn apart - the most gruesome gore I have seen till date"></head><body><p>The saw trilogy is a continuos story. When they wrote saw, I am sure they did not have trilogy in mind. Infact saw was not even intended for mainstream theatre release when it was in it's initial project stage. The success of saw :-) saw to it that 2 and 3 came out. The success is due to the originality of the story, the plotting, the ingenious wretched instruments of torture/death and the gore. I have not seen gore of such a raw nature in any other movie. It is clinical and methodical gore'n'guts. saw 2 is the best of the saw3 (I haven't seen 4 yet) so saw2 got 5 stars, saw3 gets only 3 stars.<br /><br />Traps in 3 include: a) Angel trap (my fav) - metal parts stitched to the ribs so when the wings open, its bye bye ribs. Everything comes flying apart. Basically you end up missing your whole torso. 2) pig mincer 3) body wrencher - neck, legs, and arms are wrenched 360 degree to provide some cool and inventive death/torture 4) big freeze 5) head detonation. (they actually show you the stump that gets left behind eeeeks !!!!)  SFX guys you rock in this movie. This movie is all about the FX. The pigs were artifically made so that they cud be thrown in the pig mincer/juicer scene. watch the fx commentary on the extras in the "traps section"<br /><br />Extras on dvd is pretty cool. There is the "the traps of Jigsaw" which shows every trap from story board, production design and sfx level. And there is also a director's audio commentary. There is a "making of". You'll be find renting this one beter off. I don't think you want to be watching this one every week else you'll end up with insomnia.<br /><br />This one is not as psychological as 2. This is more in your face blood and guts. Its all about ribs flying apart, intestines comming out, bones being broken and heads being blow apart. Pls be warned this one is the most most grossest of the whole series. I mean it. Walk away from this movie if this kind of stuff gives you insomnia or nightmares.<br /><br />Just watch the movie for what it is. If you are squeamish about blood and gore, you won't be renting this one out anyway. The Critics on many sites have panned the whole saw series. I think it's unfair to judge the movie as bad from the angle that there is too much gore. you have to first be a fan of the genre and then judge it within the genre of blood'n'guts films. Thing is saw is so cutting edge, new age and barrier breaking that I dont think there's been a movie like saw. The images are pretty gruesome and not for the faint heartened.<br /><br />Saw 3 is a total epsiode continuation of saw2. The characters start basically where they left off in 2. So if you don't see saw2 before seeing this one, you won't be able to make sense of the movie flow and login as there are a lot of flash backs to saw 2 . The set from saw 1 refuses to go away. The cut ankle is still lying there in that toilet and those ppl are still there with their decomposing bodies. "Ohh yes there will be blood" he said. And you know what, 3 doesn't delievers blood alone, it just spills out ribs, guts and flesh. Satisfaction gauranteed.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

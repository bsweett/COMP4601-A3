<meta name="summary" content="Better than I was expecting..."></head><body><p>I don't know why I finally decided to watch this after all these years.<br />I was in the mood for something spooky I guess.<br />Based on all the negative reviews this movie has gotten I was curious...with Ledger and Damon could it really be THAT bad?<br />Well...no.  :)<br /><br />This movie is VERY Tim Burton Sleepy Hallow except it came out years before that movie.<br />The atmosphere, art direction, cinematography, acting, score were all done excellently.<br /><br />The bad...the pacing was the only thing I didn't care for.<br />At 2 hours it felt a good half hour longer than it needed to be.<br />That minor complaint aside, if you love creepy Halloweenish Tim Burton sytled movies with great acting, visuals and dark humor than I'd say give this film a whirl.<br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

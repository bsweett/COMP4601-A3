And that's why this film was such a collosal disappointment to me.  Yes, the special effects are teriffic, but the screenplay is SO corny and contrived that I found myself wishing that all of the human characters would be anihilated.  Problem number one is Jamie Gertz's character, the girfriend of Bill Paxton's hero character.  She serves absolutely no purpose and every moment she is on screen is like fingernails on the blackboard.  Then there's the alleged romance between Helen Hunt and Paxton that is completely contrived and predicatble.  Let's also throw in an incredibly stupid subplot involving so &quot;bad guy&quot; rival scientists (&quot;bad&quot; only because they have the audacity to take better paying jobs and to have theories that differ from the heroes).  The film also makes the fundamental scientific mistake of referring to the climax tornado as an &quot;F5&quot; when that scientific description refers to the damage a tornado causes, not its appearance.  Believe me, I could keep going.<p>Bottom line is that the screenplay for this film was written at about the level of a ten-year-old.  It has as many surprises and about as much drama as a Saturday morning cartoon.  Any weather-phile with a brain will likely be sorely disappointed.</p></body></html>

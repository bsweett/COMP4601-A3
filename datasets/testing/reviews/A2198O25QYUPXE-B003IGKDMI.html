<meta name="summary" content="A hard hitting gangster movie"></head><body><p>"Goodfellas" is the story of boyhood friends who grow to become hardcore criminals. The depth of their ventures range from drugs to cold blooded murder, yet their own success gradually divides them as a unit. Treachery doesn't even spare those on the throne of criminal royalty, as the battle to avoid prosecution and jail time leads to sell outs for the sake of self-preservation. It is a graphic and entertaining gangster film.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></body></html>

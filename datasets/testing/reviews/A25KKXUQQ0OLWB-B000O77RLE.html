I am not the biggest fan of Clint Eastwood, even as a director but can't deny he has talent.  This film is one I loved and will remember forever.  I am amazed that he was so willing to make the film in Japanese and worked so hard to make it as authentic as possible.  While Flags of Our Fathers comes out as too distant or false, this film comes with great feeling and insight.  It well deserved a nomination for Best Picture and probably should have won it.  I really appreciated this filma and highly recommend others to see it too.</p></body></html>

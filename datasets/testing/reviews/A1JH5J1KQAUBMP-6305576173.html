<meta name="summary" content="Classic horror spoof"></head><body><p>A relative of the original Dr. Frankenstein becomes heir to his ancestor's work in this hilarious spoof of the classic horror film.  Mel Brooks is generally overrated as a filmmaker, and Gene Wilder's later films failed to deliver many laughs.  However, this collaboration shows the genius they are capable of in the right circumstances.  The cast is excellent and the choice to shoot in black and white was inspired.</p></body></html>

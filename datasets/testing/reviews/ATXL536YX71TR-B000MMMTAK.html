<meta name="summary" content="I laughed 'til I cried: BORAT exposing America's Hypocrasies and Prejudices"></head><body><p>Well I finally saw it...the most outrageous,out-there parody on American culture that made me laugh 'til I cried....and then I cried out of the realization that "the driving school instructor from Perry Hall" , who has tried to sue the film makers, lives 5 minutes from me....that the "frat boys" are trying to sue the film makers for the incredibly offensive things they said about women and minorities, claiming they were drunk (oh yeah,and high as a kite, too!). Why do we get offended when we are exposed for who really we are? That is the question that is posed here in the film BORAT.I can absolutely see why people got upset at this film.It is appealing AND appalling.It is outrageous and it is sensitive.It is mockery and it is sadly the truth.BORAT is a mockumentary of the highest order where one sets out to spoof only to get the real scoop.People show their true colours, whether positive or negative when they think that they are in a "safe place" to do so.( I have learned this many times over the years...when people don't REALLY know who you are, and think you are like them,they will say what THEY really think...and yes,I am always "off-ended"...regain my balance...and then tell them what a fool they just made of themselves!My favorite is when an old man went on to me about the [...], only to find out that my sister is married to a man from Japan...GREAT!...all you ever have to do is not get upset, but simply tell the person the truth.God, do they back-peddle and get embarrassed...all without any argument!)<br />I understand that Kazakhstan considers Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat)_ public enemy # 1! Perhaps America ought to wake up and take a good long look at itself....of course, when they see themselves, all they want to do is sue! Highly recommended for anyone who is open minded and can roll with the punches...and highly recommended for those who will be grossly offended so that maybe their prides and prejudices will be exposed.The wound only heals when the scab falls off!<br /><br />After seeing Sacha Baron Cohen in the presently out Sweeney Todd, I also needed to see what else this guy could do.He can act and sing in SWEENEY and he can make us roar with laughter in BORAT.``````````</p></body></html>

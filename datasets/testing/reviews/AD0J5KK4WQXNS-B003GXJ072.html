<meta name="summary" content="Widescreen + Dolby!! YEAH!!!!"></head><body><p>Alien must be seen in widescreen and heard in Dolby. It was one of the original widescreen video releases that did good quality stereo. There is just so much in the design element to Alien that Scott launched his career out of it as a major Hollywood player plus adding a female action hero even defined a whole new generation of film making thought. It was even more interesting that it came of the back of an idea penned by John Carpenter's buddy Dan O'Bannon, called "Star Beast."<br /><br />The poster is one of the most interesting of all time. It is just so suggestive and that tag line "In space no one can hear you scream" spells a new genre of science-fiction/horror and Alien is exactly that and then some more. The deep space opening sequence is perfectly slow, the crew coming out of their hyper-sleep, the inside design of the ship, Scott's background talent in art-design coming to the forefront of the movie within the first frame, realism in science-fiction movie characters!, the challenging dialogue, Hollywood mainstream this is not. The crashed UFO can barely be seen or made out on the full screen tape, but in widescreen you just see so much more and on DVD it is cleaner even still. A whole new movie is right here.<br /><br />The infamous chest-busting sequence still has all the impact that it originally had, the surprise twist in the story coming after various members of the ships crew go missing, is likewise a surprise, the alien hunt in the shafts and the closing of the vents like nails on a chalkboard means now we also get to hear the re-mastered sound on DVD, and the movie Alien has some of the best sound effects ever for a film.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine that a film this perfect can actually be topped by its sequel. Alien is one of the scariest films ever made. Its sequel, Aliens, happens to be a lot scarier but still the best in the series are the first two movies and let's leave it at that.<br /><br />Why box set?</p></body></html>

Winslet's character is a hopeless romantic, her boyfriend gets engaged to another woman and decides to swap her house for two weeks with a lonesome American, Cameron Diaz does a wonderful job, she keeps getting better and better with each film. Amanda (Diaz) has discovered her boyfriend has been cheating on her with his receptionist, he blames Amanda saying she pushed him away and that's why he strayed. Deciding to start anew, Amanda and Iris (Winslet) change their scenery and lives. With that being said, eventually both ladies find love again, I won't spoil the rest but The Holiday isn't a perfect film but it's darn close. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

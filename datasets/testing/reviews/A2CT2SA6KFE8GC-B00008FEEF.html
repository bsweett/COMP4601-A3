Halloween 2 was made for the sole purpose of moola.  The first was a huge success and at this time the slasher movie at the height of it's popularity thanks to Friday The 13th.  Carpenter admits(in the documentary on the anniversary dvd of Halloween) that he had a very difficult time writing this film(he did it while drunk for the mostpart) coz he felt he was pretty much remaking his original film, which he basically was.  He never wanted a sequel to Halloween, but apparently someone else did.  Luckily he got out of directing, and left that to Rick Rosenthal who went on to do the nauseating Halloween: Resurrection.  Well, considering Carpenter was stuck in this pickle I think he did alright.  I mean, Halloween 2 is as good as it could be.  When doing a sequel to a movie like Halloween, there's only so much you can do.  Given the subject matter, you can't really give the audience anything new that they haven't already seen in the first film-We all know what to expect.  Halloween 2 is best viewed as silly slasher flick fun to be enjoyable.  It ups the gore and the nudity.  It also gives us that famous twist about Laurie actually being Michael's sister.  I do like the fact that this is one of those rare sequels that begins immediately after the events of the first film and continues on through Halloween night.  Basically, Laurie's taken to the hospital where Michael follows and kills anyone that stands in the way.  The suspense of the first movie takes a backseat as this movie plays out like any typical slasher film of the time.  It does achieve some creepiness due to some good camera angles of Michael lurking in the shadows, in halls, etc.  He kills a woman by drowning her in boiling water, and this is a highlight of the film coz this particular murder is so messed up and gruesome.  Carpenter's intentions at the end of the film are crystal clear.  Obviously he wanted to make sure that he could be spared making another Halloween film by giving this one definite closure.  He goes to great lengths to show you that Michael Myers is dead.  The final shot of the film is ten seconds or so of Michael burning to a crisp-it's a very obvious statement of, "This is The End....NOW LEAVE IT ALONE!"  Of course we all know how well Hollywood listened to this.  Carpenter even tried to push this point by taking the series in a different direction with Halloween 3(a very entertaining horror flick by the way), but too many babies didn't understand what Carpenter was doing and panned it for it's lack of Michael.  Halloween 2 is the one and true sequel to Halloween.  Personally, I try to forget 4-8 even exist.  With 2, don't be expecting cinematic art, you have to enjoy it the way you would the Friday The 13th sequels.  Which is to say, don't be afraid to laugh.</p></body></html>

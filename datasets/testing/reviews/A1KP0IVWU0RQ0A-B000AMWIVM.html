<meta name="summary" content="what would you do to live,or to save a loved one?"></head><body><p>that is the central question in this creepy and excessively violent thriller that works well as long as you don't stop and think about it to long!<br /><br />  to men awake in a dirty bathroom chained to the walls,a dead body between them,with tapes telling them that one must kill the other to save his family. the man(a doctor) is given a bullet and the dead man has a gun in hand(he looks to have shot himself)! problem is neather man can reach him,but they have hacksaws,they won't cut the chain,but they will cut......well you get the idea! the rest of the movie unfolds as the men try to find out why they are there,and what's going on.<br /><br />  this grim story is one that will pull you in and has a great twist at the end,just don't think about it to much! NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!!!!!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

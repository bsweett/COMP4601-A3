Fortunately this is not the case!<br /><br />It is a great reconstruction of the Civil War period based on personal letters from Col. Shaw and two books: Kirstein's "Lay this Laurel" and Burchard's "One Gallant Rush". From this solid documental background an outstanding film emerges.<br /><br />The storyline follows the evolution of the first all Afro American Regiment in the USA Army.<br /><br />Show step by step from the recruiting, boots camp practice, first war actions till the mighty final charge.<br /><br />Col. Shaw and his aide Maj. Forbes should fight prejudice within the officers and high command.<br /><br />Sgt. Major Rawlings should fight to bring together his green bunch of recruits into a soldier's team, proud of themselves and capable to endure and overcome all obstacles.<br /><br />Pvt. Trip should fight to tame his rebel soul in order to be part of the group.<br /><br />The movie has many great moments; three of them are delivered in the last fifteen minutes: the soldier's meeting the night before the attack, the regiment passing thru the deployed army and the glorious final charge. Really unforgettable!<br /><br />Matthew Broderick has the perfect physque-du-rol? to impersonate a very young man (almost wet behind the ears) charged with an overwhelming task. He delivers a nice acting piece.<br /><br />This said, undoubtedly, the best acting performance are in charge of Denzel Washington, justly awarded with Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and Morgan Freeman.<br /><br />Edward Zwick as director (he is also a very successful producer) delivers his best film up to this day. Better IMHO to "The Last Samurai" (2003) that was a very good one.<br /><br />I hope he will give the public a good version of one of my favorite fiction book: "The Lions of Al-Rassan" (promised for next year).<br /><br />This is for me the best Civil War movie I've seen. Enjoy!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

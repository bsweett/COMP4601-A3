<meta name="summary" content="The most groundbreaking animated Pixar film of all time."></head><body><p>"Monsters Inc" gets my nod as my favorite of the trainload of CGI animated features that Pixar has brought forth during this great time for animated movies versus the awful period for music. "Toy Story" paved the way for these movies but I never thought it would happen but "Monster's Inc" does the unthinkable, it actually surpasses "Toy Story" not only in the excellent animation but also of groundbreaking graphics (Sully's Fur) and of a really, REALLY original story idea. I guess it's safe to say that this movie made me conquer my fear of going into the closets at night and if there are monsters, I'm no longer afraid of them. Just for a little humor. I haven't laughed so hard the way I did with seeing "Monster's Inc" and it's hard not to see why. That's why I love Pixar's movies. They aim for all ages from young children to elderly audiences and "Monsters Inc" is the best of them all alongside "Finding Nemo". The whole story plot idea is unbelievably original and unsurpassed by many movies since this one. <p>It all begins with a typical night with a monster who aims to scare a sleeping child by creeping out of the closet. The whole thing goes awry and turns out to be a simulation and we discover the reasons why monsters actually come out of closets and scare the children of the human world. The Monsters scare the children because they need to collect the children's screams to a utility power plant where the screams generate electricity for their city of Monstropolis. However the city of Monstropolis is facing a looming power shortage because the children of the human world are becoming harder and harder to scare and thus brownouts are becoming more and more commonplace, threatening the very well being of the monster world. The problems don't stop there. While the top scarer of the monster crew James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) continues his winning streak as the number one scarer, a nemesis co-worker named Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) is also causing some headaches. The CEO of the company Henry J. Waternoose is also ready to use any means to keep his company from collapsing from the power crisis gripping Monstropolis. <p>The main storyline though is of a much more chaotic incident. According to Waternoose's warnings, the humans possibly carry germs that may be deadly for monsters to become infected with and the crews take drastic measures to avoid getting touched by the humans that they try to scare. One night, as Sullivan is going to turn in his assistant Mike Wazowski's paperwork and finds a door that is activated. He opens it and unaware of it, a toddler escapes through the door and right into the monster factory. Unable to get her back into her right bedroom, Sullivan attempts to disguise her but fails and as utter pandemonium follows, and vast numbers of C.D.A. (Child Detection Agency) decontamination units scouring the city for the missing child, Sullivan along with his longtime friend Mike Wazowski are on a long quest to get Boo home without being caught by the C.D.A. Sully and Mike however are unaware that they have several enemies that are working within their own ranks which make their mission to return Boo home more complicated and more dangerous. <p> The computer generated animation effects are absolutely breathtaking in just aobut every way you look at it. The animation effects of Sullivan's turquoise blue fur is so well done that it looks almost like actual live footage of a costume. Even the movements look incredibly lifelike and the details in the movie are just incredible! This movie is just about perfect in so many ways. If there is any quibble I have aobut this movie, it's that it's only 90 minutes long. Perhaps I'm spoiled at the movie lengths after seeing the Lord of The Rings movies but I think "Monsters Inc" should've been at least two hours long for more fun but that's just my opinion.<p> The actors selected for the voices perfectly match the personalities of the characters they provided the voice work for. The late James Coburn perfectly fitted the elderly role of the longtime elder Henry J. Waternoose, CEO of the Monsters Incorporated Company which his family has owned for three generations and it's really sad that Coburn moved on so soon after such a great movie. My favorite of all is of John Goodman who provides the stadium sized voice of the great James P. Sullivan, the top scarer of the Monsters Inc. workforce. He sounds so incredibly funny when he screams especially during when he discovers Boo has escaped into the factory. Billy Crystal is incredibly awesome playing Sullivan's constantly agitated assistant and lifelong friend Mike Wazowski and his voice is perfectly especially when Wazowski is uptight about things. Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, they're all great. <p> While younger viewers will certainly have a great time with the charm factor of this movie, older audiences will likely get a truly good message of about how even fearsome-looking creatures or human beings can in reality turn out being very gentle and caring beings who wouldn't even hurt a fly. And while I don't believe that monsters necessarily exist in most places, this movie also explains the reasons why monsters do this, scaring the daylights out of the sleeping children, they need their screams to power their cities but the monsters are just as scared of the children as the children are of them. <p> Enough said, go and buy this DVD as soon as you can. This is one of the greatest animated movies that has ever been made and the crew behind it's conception deserve the utmost praise for it's creation.</p></body></html>

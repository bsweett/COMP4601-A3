<meta name="summary" content="Suspenseful and fun"></head><body><p>"Catch Me If You Can," directed by Steven Spielberg, is based on the real life story of Frank Abagnale. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Abagnale, a young con artist who successfully masquerades as an airline pilot (among other professions) and passes off forged checks in the course of his travels. Tom Hanks portrays the nerdy but dedicated FBI agent who relentlessly pursues young Abagnale.<p>"Catch Me" opens with a great, atmospheric animated sequence that is perfectly complemented by John Williams' score. The movie as a whole is an excellent blend of suspense, human drama, and laughs. Although the film deals with some very serious themes, the tone is largely light and fun. Abagnale conducts his scams during the 1960s and the film makes superb use of period music, film, clothing, and cars: it's great fun to look at and listen to.<p>The performances, script, and direction are first rate. The story is told in a very effective non-chronological fashion. DiCaprio shines in this lead role; he brings a nice mix of charm, brains, and boyish enthusiasm to the character. Hanks' likeable character is an excellent foil for DiCaprio's. Special mention should be made of Christopher Walken's witty yet touching performance as young Abagnale's father. Overall, I found this to be one of the most enjoyable, skillfully crafted, and satisfying films of 2002.</p></body></html>

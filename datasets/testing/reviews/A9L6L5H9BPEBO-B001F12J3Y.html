<meta name="summary" content="Hearing the Bells in your Christmas"></head><body><p>The Polar Express taps into our affirmation that Christmas is believing, that believing is good, that being good will always be rewarded, and that we must keep faith with our beliefs and our dreams or they will disappear into the lost innocence of adulthood.<br /><br />Hungering for a classic of some kind that would remind me of the larger-than-life Christmas stories of my childhood, I started to watch this even though I had passed it by with channel surfing warp speed dozens of times before. It wasn't long before I realized I might be watching a classic I had been yearning for.<br /><br />It is Christmas Eve and a little boy is fighting sleep with a rising skepticism in the belief of Santa Claus. A check of his atlas by flashlight confirms that the North Pole is an uninhabitable and barren place, just before he jumps back into bed one blanket ahead of his parents opening his door.  He hears his father whisper to his mother about the end of the magic, which he thinks has something to do with the belief in Santa. Later, and still awake, the sound of a train's whistle and its cars with yellow light blazing from passenger car windows, appear on the snow in front of his house. In robe, pajamas and slippers, he heads out to explore when a conductor asks if he's going to get on board. His adventure to the North Pole, on the Polar Express begins.<br /><br />He meets a sweet-looking wholesome, black girl who is as trusting as he is doubtful, a nerd who hides his doubts behind glasses and know-it-all obnoxiousness, a later, younger arrival who only seems to trust his own solitude, and a hobo who sounds cynical and kindly at the same time.<br /><br />The animation was so good that the children almost seemed real. Tom Hanks lent his voice to at least three characters I could identify, and the music, especially the song "Believe" was absolutely enchanting. The story is how each of us react to our doubts and fears that some things are true or that some are not, that the strongest things to believe in are the things we cannot see or hear. In the end, we find out if our hero, the skeptic can still hear the bells when they could no longer be heard by others.<br /><br />Here's hoping you can hear the bells in your Christmas--and still believe.</p></body></html>

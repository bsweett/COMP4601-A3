<meta name="summary" content="Four Brothers explodes with 4 outstanding perofrmances...a great ride"></head><body><p>Mark Wahlberg (Fear, The Italian Job) is Bobby Mercer, a tough guy ex'boxer. Tyrse Gibson (Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious) is Angel, a soldier boy. Andre Benjamin (Be Cool, member of Outkast) is Jeremiah, a father of 2 who stayed home and is trying to get his business up and running and Garrett Hedlund plays Jack, a Rock and Roll star. The 4 Brothers reunite to bring down the killers who were involved with the shooting of their mother in a corner store. The 4 Brothers, just like the guys in Western's would do, is seek justice, no matter what the consequences are. Intense Urban Western Thriller with Wahlberg, Hedlund, Gibson and especially Andre Benjamin giving outstanding and good performances. Also starring Chiwetel Ejiofor (Dirty Pretty Things, the upcoming Serenity), Terrence Howard (Hustle & Flow, Ray), Josh Charles (S.W.A.T., Sports Night),Sofia Vergara (Big Trouble '02) Adam Beach (Smoke Signals, Joe Dirt) and Fiounna Flaganan as the 4 Brothers Mother. Probably one of the best movies of the year on my list. 4 Brothers dishes out excitement and the director, John Singleton knows how to do it well.</p></body></html>

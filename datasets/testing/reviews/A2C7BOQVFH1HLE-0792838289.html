<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing Thriller But Too Bad About the DVD!"></head><body><p>This is one of my favourite films because of the performance of the cast and the uniqueness of the story.  One of my favourite scenes of all-time has to be the garden party scene which for me deserves 5 stars already.  I never thought I could hate Angela Lansbury that sweet little old lady from "Murder She Wrote" so much as I did here which to me is a sign of great acting on her part and I thought Lawrence Harvey was excellent here as well.  Sinatra was okay but nothing close to his performance in "From Here To Eternity".  Overall, the film for me was an exciting and chilling thriller although the ending bit with Sinatra's monologue was rather poor as I was hoping for a better way to end what otherwise was a good film.<br /><br />The problem here lies with the DVD which hasn't been restored well leading to a poor overall picture quality although it was nice to have both the Standard and Widescreen versions on either side of the disc but it goes without saying that the best way to view this film is Widescreen.  The sound quality is not that great and there are no special features worth mentioning as well.  Let's hope they make a much better effort with the Blu-ray version with better sound quality options as well as much better picture quality improvements.<br /><br />Entertaining drama although you may want to wait for a better restored version to surface and give this particular version a miss.</p></body></html>

The two leads are like listening to chalk on a blackboard for two obnoxious hours. The old codger is the cranky fuddy duddy you would shy from checking the mail if he was in the front yard next to yours. I don't want to hear it. The wilderness explorer kid is a slap in the face contrivance to the boy scouts of America that they are a herd of cutsie wootsie beings trying to be a flame of gosh golly gee goodness. Wrong. Boy scouts are a serious bunch of explorers that surround themselves in fun with what they are doing. Learning to be a better American, and not a bothersome kid. The dogs should have taken over production as the short animation extra, Special Mission, proves they were more adorable, original, and could hold their own turf away from the dreary humans. Even the extra Partly Cloudy was a milestone in comparison to the main feature. I mean what is with these features. The artists conjure up some finally drawn character, give them some rather cliche typecast traits and expect the audience to fall in love. Like when the old man tearfully browsed through an old photo album with emotional piano score, I was thinking, the audience never got to know his sweetheart other than the goofy intro to the movie. I fastforwrded that part on the DVD, thank goodness, it was giving me the creeps.</p></body></html>

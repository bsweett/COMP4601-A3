<meta name="summary" content="Looks fine, actors are good, but left me unconvinced; Jacob's Ladder does this one better"></head><body><p>3.5 stars<br /><br />Scorsese had all the right ideas here, but at 140 minutes this was 30 too long for my taste, and didn't leave me feeling anything but somewhat disappointed, despite fine performances and a good story.<br /><br />DiCaprio is excellent as usual, as is Kingsley, but the script takes too long to unfold, and after a while I began to smell the coming twist {spoilers on the way}. The bummer for me is that this film flirts with the incredible cinematic potential of the MK Ultra project, but backs off just when it could truly have broken new ground. Jacob's Ladder addresses many of the themes here much more convincingly, and if you liked this make sure to see that one. Both JL and Fight Club came to mind while watching this, but both of those brought it all home with much more weight.<br /><br />This film looks very fine on blu-ray, and the subtle CGI adds to the paranoid feel. The music is rather too obvious and telegraphic, but clearly that was the idea. MS sure knows how to move a camera and compose a shot, truly a master. But this one needed way more editing to have the impact it wanted, and it all drags long enough that the ending is more a relief than a surprise.<br /><br />Back to the MK Ultra theme, and the brief nod to Operation Paperclip (look them up if you don't know of them, and prepare to learn some incredible American history they left out of your schoolbooks): these are topics that are DYING to be turned into a truly classic film, and Scorsese is a perfect candidate. For a while here I was thrilled to think that these vital missing links in our post-war history would finally be looked at in depth, but they're merely passing fragments. Come on, Marty! You or Francis could make a movie about those topics that would change the way we see ourselves as a country, and maybe even influence present political culture for the better...so please do!<br /><br />But in the meantime we get a very good-looking gothic throwaway, based on Lehane's novel but with little of his special touch. The Aviator and The Departed both blow this one out of the water, and while Scorsese and DiCaprio still make a fine team, I'm looking forward to another outing from them of higher quality once again, with more incision and less scattershot intensity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rambo comes full circle"></head><body><p>"First Blood" remains one of my favorite films of all time, so when I saw this coming up I was both excited and apprehensive. After the catastrophe that was "Rambo 3", I didn't have high hopes for this. I was wrong.<br /><br />While this can't be called "high cultural entertainment", it's a fun movie. If you thought the body count of "Rambo 3" was over the top, you've got some surprises coming. I believe, by last count, he kills the entire population of Burma...twice. And no one dies with a simple "bang", but must explode in a gush of blood and guts everywhere. The movie is way way waaaaaaaay overboard with deaths, but Stallone manages to keep Rambo true to the character we've seen in the previous films.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the final scene in the film. It allowed Rambo to come full circle through it all. Contrast this final scene with the first scene of "First Blood" and you'll really be impressed. The wandering is over, so to speak. I'd really love to see another installment of the Rambo franchise, but I doubt this will ever happen. As it stands, this is a nice way to send our hero off into the sunset.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Boring....horrible"></head><body><p>Another Wes Anderson movie, unfortunately they get worse one by one.<br />This movie is basically Royal Tennenbaums II, except set in India.<br />Owen Wilson is the same pretentious, faux-humility character as always.<br />The scenes sputter along, with a lot of dead air, and dialogue about nothing imparticular.  There is a vague gloom and sense of failure, again,<br />and a screenplay that could be written over a bottle of $6 chenin blanc.<br />Also, the intro "short film" was utterly dreadful and pointless.  I'm sorry, but this is vapid garbage.</p></body></html>

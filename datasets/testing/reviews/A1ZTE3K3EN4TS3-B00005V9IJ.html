The one unique thing about it that I'll say is that when Hanks is first marooned on the island, there is never any musical score, thus giving you the feeling of his isolation.  Very good and very haunting.  Otherwise, there is no real explanation why he would stay on the island so long without trying to escape.  An ok film, but not one that you'd want to watch again anytime soon.</p></body></html>

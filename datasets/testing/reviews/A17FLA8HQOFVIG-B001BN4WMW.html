<meta name="summary" content="Never seemed real to me"></head><body><p>This 1995 film, starring Mel Gibson, who also directed it, is the legendary myth of  William Wallace, a Scot commoner who united the 13th century Scots against the English.  Technically, it works well, especially the battle scenes which are frequent, bloody and violent.  They also are not confusing.  The audience always knows who the bad guy is, and what the battle strategy is. However, even though I knew this was a myth, and not based on historical fact, I found the story hard to believe.  Would an English Princess really travel to the battlefield to make love to the King's enemy?<p>Mel Gibson is a good actor, but he seemed too old for the part, especially when he weds his childhood sweetheart in the early part of the film.  The casting for the supporting roles was better:  Patrick McGoohan as the wicked king of England, Brendan Gleason as Mel Gibson's best friend, Catherine McCormack as his first love, Sophie Marceu as the princess.<p>No matter how sad the story or gruesome the violence, I didn't feel any emotional pull.  That was because it never seemed real.  It was also much too long at three hours.  I recommend this video only for those who are interested in 13th Century warfare and unremitting violence.  For Mel Gibson fans, however, check out &quot;The Patriot&quot;;  its a much better film.</p></body></html>

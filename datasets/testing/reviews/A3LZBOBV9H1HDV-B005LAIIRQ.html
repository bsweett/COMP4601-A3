<meta name="summary" content=""The Grey" is great!"></head><body><p>"The Grey" is great! This is how the story goes: A group of oil-rig roughnecks are left stranded on the sub-arctic tundra after their plane experiences a complete mechanical failure and crashes into the remote Alaskan wilderness. The survivors, battling mortal injuries, biting cold and ravenous hunger, are relentlessly hunted and pursued by a vicious pack of rogue wolves.<br /><br />The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Ottway) is great. The directing by Joe Carnahan (who also produced) is great. The screenplay (based on the short story "Ghost Walker" by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers) by Carnahan & Jeffers is great.<br /><br />The music by Marc Streitenfeld is great. The cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi is great. The film editing by Roger Barton, Jason Hellmann & Joseph Jett Sally is great. The casting by John Papsidera is great. The production design by John Willett is great. The art direction by Ross Dempster is great. The set decoration by Peter Lando is great. The costume design by Courtney Daniel is great. The special make-up, creature and animatronic effects by Gregory Nicotero & Howard Berger is great.<br /><br />This is a great action-thriller that keeps your mind thinking while your heart is racing and you are on the edge of your seat. Liam Neeson is great as Ottway and this is another great movie for him. This is also another great movie for director Joe Carnahan. This is also a great movie to start the year off with.</p></body></html>

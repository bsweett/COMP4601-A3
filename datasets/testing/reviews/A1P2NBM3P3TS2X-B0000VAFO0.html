<meta name="summary" content="Spiffy effects, but boring movie"></head><body><p>Not much originality in this film.  Mostly it tries to emulate the look, feel, sound, and mood of some better films (&quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;The Crow&quot;, etc).<p>Special effects are very good, but even that can't save a dull script and the slow pacing.<p>There's an old maxim in the theatre that goes, &quot;If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.&quot;  If the script isn't compelling to read, no amount of spiffy set dressing, effects, etc will elevate it to a higher level.  Same here with &quot;Underworld&quot;.  It looks good, but the script anchors it down to sub-par level.<p>A friend loaned me this DVD to watch, so at least I didn't have to shell out any $$ for this.</p></body></html>

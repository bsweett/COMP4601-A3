<meta name="summary" content="What a different film the BD is..."></head><body><p>I wish I could explain eloquently how changed I am about an opinion on a film. Watching the BD is experiencing an entirely different and much better movie.<br /><br />Technically, this is a 5 star product. I played it both on plasmas and LCDs over the last few days and it looks excellent. Paused well over 50 different scenes (motion and still scenes) and everything looks as it should for what they were trying to create. The filmmakers held an exclusive BD screening to show off their special effects and their pride in how the fx came across, so the resulting look is reasonably solid. The usual Universal menus and selection sounds are throughout, and all of the typical BD features are enabled/possible here.<br /><br />The resounding difference here are the deleted scenes. There are over 42 minutes of all the best parts left for us to interject back into the film. The reason I did not give this a 5 star is they should have made the choice to have the BD be the 2 hour 35 minute cut. The majority of every gripe I have heard about this film is answered or fixed with these scenes. Christina Cabot (Major), Ty Burrel (psych boyfriend), and Peter Mensah (the other General) all had their characters ripped to shreds with this theatrical cut. There was actually a good side to Roth, there was actually tons of character development; all apparently cut (in my opinion) to dumb down the film. What a waste.<br /><br />Be sure to have your speakers adjusted correctly because this sound mix can blow a sub or mids if you have them set to high. Great sounds, great clarity and plenty of features. Highly recommend as a purchase, and the only shortcoming is on the director for giving a 3 second intro to the deleted scenes that stated nothing of why he destroyed this film by cutting them.</p></body></html>

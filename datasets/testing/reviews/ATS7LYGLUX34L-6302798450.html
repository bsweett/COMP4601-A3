Here we find our hero Ash (The mighty Bruce Campbell) stranded in Medieval times, surrounded by "Deadites", and short on allies. Luckily he has an endless supply of one-liners to go along with his chainsaw and shotgun....<p>  The movie is hilarious; I laughed more than I do for most straight comedies. The original ending is intact, but I wish they could have found room on the disc for the ending shown in theaters, for completists like myself. The commentary by Campbell and Sam & Ivan Raimi is a laugh riot, as well as being informative, and the handful of deleted scenes are fun, too. The subtitle option enables you to see the film's storyboards in the corner of the screen while viewing the picture, and there's a small gallery of production art as well. No trailers or anything else, though. The disc is kinda short on extras, but Dead-heads will find it worth purchasing....</p></body></html>

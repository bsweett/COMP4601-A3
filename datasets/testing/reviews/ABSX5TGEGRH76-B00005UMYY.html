I mean, Memento is told backwards, with the end at the beginning and the beginning at the end.  The story revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), an ex-insurance claims investigator who had to give up his job after he lost his ability to create new memories.  He lives by taking photos and keeping notes of his life.<br /><br />The last thing he remembers is two men raping and killing his wife.  So he has dedicated his new life to finding- and killing- the man who killed his wife and took away his memory.  All he knows about the man are the few facts that he pulled from the police file from the accident: his name is either John or James, and his surname's initial is G (John or James G.).  The man has a connection to illegal drugs, and he has a license plate number.  Along the way, he is joined by Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), a guy who he fears he cannot trust, and Natalie, a woman helping him out of pity.  Unfortunately for Leonard, though, his notes can be manipulated, and he soon realizes that no one can be fully trusted.<br /><br />The great thing about the way this movie is told is that, since we haven't seen the events leading up to a scene, we are just as in the dark about the situation as Leonard, and just when we think we have something figured out, our beliefs can be shattered in an instant when the truth is revealed.<br /><br />You'd think that with the end at the beginning, it would be impossible for there to be a twist ending (I know I thought so), but just the opposite is true; the final scene of this film will completely blow you away.<br /><br />This is one of the few thrillers as of late that succeeds in it's mission statement; to keep the viewer guessing and to deliver a killer twist ending.  I guarantee you'll be thinking about this film long after it is over.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Love finds a way"></head><body><p>Bads boys John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughan) are divorce mediators. But when springtime rolls in and the wedding season gets under way, they become weekend wedding crashers, pretending to be part of the family in order to score free food and loose women. They are very good at what they do, but are beginning to think they might be getting a little old for the game<br /><br />Anyone who can't guess that by the end of the film they will have abandoned their wayward ways and found true love should not be allowed to rent or buy this movie.<br /><br />"Wedding Crashers" is goofy and charming. It's probably one of the best buddy movies of recent years. Vince Vaughn, especially is terrific. It is a relief to know that some actors can still summon up a range of facial expressions. Vaughan runs through expressions with a rapidity and intelligence that was often hard to keep up with. Wilson was adequate, and shone brighter in the glare of Vaughan's over-the-top persona. Together, the two of them captured the hedonistic approach of these overgrown juveniles. They were great together and really came across as the life-long friends they were supposed to be portraying, who (for all their purported selfishness) actually brought life and joy to the weddings they crashed.<br /><br />Kudos to Isla Fisher and Jane Symour, who played the sisters (Gloria and Kathleen Cleary) who got entangled into the boys' scheming. Isla was positively terrifying as the "clinger" who latched onto Jeremy. And Seymour played just the right mix of beauty, charm and vulnerability as the girl Wilson wants to rescue from marriage to a lout.<br /><br />The only downside to "Wedding Crashers" (and which loses the movie 1 star) is the gratuitous nudity, language and vulgarity that the writers threw in. But the film made me laugh, which is a rarity these days.<br /><br />The DVD version has the usual deleted scenes (lame) and director's commentary, which I did not listen to. It also includes an "uncorked" version which is 8-1/2 minutes longer than the original. Given the level of raunch in the theatrical version, I did not want to go near material that didn't make the cut. YMMD.<br /><br />On the whole, a charming and satisfying movie.</p></body></html>

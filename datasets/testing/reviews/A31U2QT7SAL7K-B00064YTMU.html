<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock Would Approve!"></head><body><p>I toyed with several titles, based on the overall quality of the film, as well as the subject matter: "Driving Mr. Crazy" because of Vincent's sociopathic nature, "Cabbies, Beware! The Next Fare May Be Your Last," or "Blonds DO HAVE more fun," in reference to Cruise's hair in the film.<br /><br />However, when I think about the total package, I could only see a film of which Sir Alfred would give his seal of approval. Like "Strangers on a Train," "Collateral" bonds two men from different worlds together, one unaware that he is about to be the "accomplice" in the other's night of murder for hire. Hitchcock in "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and "North by Northwest" did the aspect of the innocent man drawn into a world of intrigue and crime. Mann casts Foxx as the innocent and the director draws brilliant performances from both actors as they "play" off each other like old friends.<br /><br />Also, Mann, like Alfred, understands how the look is essential to the success of the film. The movie's setting, Los Angeles, takes on a part of its own, simultaneously looking both menacing and captivating. Only San Francisco in Hitchcock's "Vertigo" looked more alluring.<br /><br />The score by James Newton Howard, as well as the use of popular songs, is another fine element that Mann incorporates in this engaging thriller. Hitchcock, too, relied on music to tell his stories.<br /><br />The second disc features a fascinating "Making of..." documentary wherein the viewer gets an in-depth look at the very meticulous Mr. Mann.<br /><br />I would love to see Cruise, Foxx, and Pinkett-Smith in another film together, helmed by Michael Mann. Maybe, they can do a remake of "North by Northwest", with Cruise in the James Mason role, Foxx as Cary Grant's character, and Pinkett-Smith as the cool "blonde" played by Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />Hey, it's just a thought!</p></body></html>

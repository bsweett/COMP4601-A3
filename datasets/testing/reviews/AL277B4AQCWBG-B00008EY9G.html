<meta name="summary" content="&quot;A&quot; cast, &quot;B&quot; movie"></head><body><p>Without giving too much away, if you've seen "Adaptation" you might recognise the plot of &quot;Identity&quot; as being akin to that of "The Three" - the "unfilmable" screenplay Charlie Kaufman's infuriating brother Donald comes up with and promptly sells for six figures.  Trust Hollywood to go make it.  It's fun for a while, but if you pick the twist it quickly becomes laborious.  If you don't pick it, then I guess "Identity" is made for your demographic and you'll probably have a great night.  For all its apparent exploration of psychology, this is really just a slasher movie dressed up with a good cast and a twist.  The players make up for what the story lacks, but only so far.  Twist movies work best when one of the central characters is the victim of the twist as much as we are, e.g. "Seven", "Fight Club" and "The Usual Suspects".  But if, as here, the audience is the only victim then the joke is on us and we're just left feeling manipulated.  So in the end, I'm with Charlie.  (But I still wish I was cashing Donald's cheque.)</p></body></html>

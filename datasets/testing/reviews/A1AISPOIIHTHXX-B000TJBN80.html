<meta name="summary" content="Surprising sequel...it's actually good"></head><body><p>I find myself kind of confused in regards to a couple scenes in 28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the hit 28 Days Later, in where there's quite a bit of gore thrown around. Normally I would chuckle that the filmmakers feel gore will scare rather than disgust and that we will lose sleep at night because of it. Yet I didn't mind it in 28 Weeks Later and even more still, I actually liked the movie as a whole. Wonder what happened here?<br /><br />About 2 months after the events of the first film, we find that the contagious disease which turns people into mindless rampagers has been contained and there's hope as well with civilians now returning to a selected area of London. But when the virus spreads, scientist Scarlet and military sniper Doyle have to take siblings Tammy and Andy, who might carry a genetic anamoly making them immune of the virus, to safety.<br /><br />I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the original. Sure it had a good opening, what with a guy waking up to a deserted London, but after that it felt kind of downhill and when they got to the military compound, I got kinda bored. This film manages to keep up its tension and keeps the atmosphere uneasy and creepy so even if the characters are safe, they probably won't be for long. It's also a bit more ambitious scale-wise than the original and while that makes it feel less indie-horror and more studio horror, it still stands on its own.<br /><br />The problem with a film in the horror genre is that it doesn't really allow the characters to feel like characters but merely munchies for whatever beast is after them. Here it's a little bit different so when a character gets killed off, we actually feel sad they're gone and not just "oop, there they go". The film's grounded by Robert Carlyle as the dad who can lie and feel emotional and feels real. Then there's also Rose Byrne who must have a natural sympathizing quality because I never get the feeling she's just going through the motions in anything.<br /><br />It might not light your world on fire and be your favorite horror film ever (or zombie film for that matter) but it can probably freak you out if it can.</p></body></html>

The bad guy wants people to change their ways, so why not open a counseling center; no, instead through some source of funding and high understanding of electronics, etc...he puts together grand schemes in which people get killed.  The ending of the movie was a complete joke.  Why would one of the abductees work for someone that tried to kill her?  She was thrown into a pit of needles and still she plays along; I think she would have just given up.  Innocent people die around her and she doesn't care to help them.  Also, the people in the house work against eachother for some odd reason,rather than help eachother out.  Where did the bad get the nerve gas and antidote.  Nothing like that is explained.  I think in the next movie they should have everyone work together and then defeat the bad guy/girl.  Finally give us some satisfaction.</p></body></html>

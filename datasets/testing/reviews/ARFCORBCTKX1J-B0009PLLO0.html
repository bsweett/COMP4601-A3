<meta name="summary" content="It could have been not just good, but "Alexander" the great."></head><body><p>This is absurd. There are three versions of this film, and each should have a separate set of reviews. Come on, Amazon. Is it so difficult to do this? This is a review of the Blu-ray "Alexander Revisited".<br /><br />The original cut of "Alexander" was controversial for a single reason... Oliver Stone refused to hide the fact that homosexual behavior was common among the Greeks (usually an older man with a younger). * It's okay to show people having their guts ripped out, but don't you dare show two intimate friends (Alexander and Hephaestion) pledging their life-long loyalty, or a man kissing a eunuch (Bagoas), then having sex with him. And although there are several stories about why Philip was murdered, Stone uses the one in which a young man, a member of his bodyguard and Philip's occasional lover, ** takes revenge when Philip fails to do anything about the young man's rape by other men.<br /><br />There is also a scene in which the young Alexander is told by Aristotle that women aren't worth loving, and that sex between men -- if it is not simply out of lust, but for the purpose of character development -- is a worthy thing. That must have gotten a lot of viewers' whities tightened.<br /><br />The real problems with "Alexander" stem from Stone's desire to present a drama, not just an historical epic. Though ancient writers reported Alexander's personality as a mixture of great ambition, high intelligence, and a sometimes uncontrollable rashness, Stone fails to present these in any coherent fashion. Alexander is portrayed as torn between love for Philip (who alternates between love and a refusal to acknowledge him as heir (whether because he believes the child a bastard, or he didn't want a half-Macedonian heir from Olympias, isnt clear)), and his mother, who's constantly pressing him to Do Great Things.<br /><br />The biggest failing of the script, however, is providing a clear reason for Alexander's heavy drinking and "seduction" by Eastern culture. The result is that a film that's supposed to illuminate one of the most-important people in history leaves us with more questions than we started with.<br /><br />An even bigger failing is Stone's disastrous casting of Colin Farrell -- who badly wanted to play the part -- as Alexander. Whatever one might think of Farrell's thespic skills, he is in totally over his head. (The blonde wig -- why is Alexander always portrayed as blonde? It looks stupid. -- doesn't help.)<br /><br />There is no question about Alexander's charisma. (He would have /had/ to been charismatic to command the loyalty of so many men for so long, especially as he shaved his beard, a no-no among Greek males. ***) Farrell gets this very well. It's the subtle moments that don't come off.<br /><br />Whenever he's disturbed or unhappy or confused, his face takes on the same sappy expression, shaking and twitching to no particular end, other than demonstrating that he can over-emote. The scenes in which he confronts his mother range from incompetent to embarrassing.<br /><br />The scene in which he bids farewell to the dying Hephaestion is particularly bad. It's perfectly fine for Alexander to cry as he tries to comfort the person he best loves, but Farrell shows an unmanly lack of control. And the little speech in which he tells Hephaestion of all the wonderful things that remain to be done, as he looks out to the world, should have been something quite grand, quite stirring, but Farrell doesn't get much further than reading the lines.<br /><br />Farrell is the right physical age for Alexander, but not the right emotional age. I remember a hetero guy in college -- not even 20 -- telling me how, when his best friend had died, he had cried himself to sleep for a month. Colin Farrell has either never experienced anything like this, or if he has, cannot convey it in his acting. He fails to bring those elements that would have at least partly compensated for the script's omissions.<br /><br />Ultimately, an actor's failure can and should be blamed on the director, especially when the director does the casting. For a director such as Oliver Stone, who commands the complexities of such a huge film so effortlessly, this failure is remarkable. How he could have shot himself in the foot is hard to understand.<br /><br />Nevertheless, "Alexander Revisited" is worth seeing, especially for the generally good script and fine performances from almost everyone but Farrell. (I had some initial problems with Val Kilmer as Philip, as we usually associate Kilmer with youthful roles, but it's an okay performance.)<br /><br />Visually, "Alexander Revisited" is stunning. I've seen the DVD on a 36" flat-face Sony, and this Blu-ray on a 60" Kuro, and there is no comparison whatever. It's one of those rare films -- such as "Lawrence of Arabia" or "2001" -- that do not come across well on anything less than a large display.<br /><br />* Contrast "Troy", in which Patroclus was turned from Achilles' younger-warrior-lover -- into his cousin! Good grief.<br /><br />** The question of whether Philip had sexual relations with adult men -- uncommon in the Greek world -- is an interesting one. As his bodyguards would presumably have been old enough to be bearded, having sex with one of them would have been considered a bit odd -- though the rest of the Greek world viewed Macedonians as kinda strange, one contemporary writer stating that Macedonian men would freely allow other men to mount them. Stone shows bearded men who are roughly Philip's contemporaries hugging him and wrapping their arms around his shoulders, familiarities it seems odd for a king to permit. I presume Stone's implication is that these are men Philip is or was having sexual relations with.<br /><br />*** Though he supposedly had a scanty beard, this is likely because he wanted to preserve the illusion -- at least for Hephaesition -- that he remained a "beardless youth". This, in turn, suggests other things I won't go into.</p></body></html>

I knew it was connected marginally to "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", (where they mention Van Helsing's name once, I think). To say the least, I was very pleased with the movie overall, from the plot to the special effects.<br /><br />Van Helsing, (Jackman), starts the movie by doing in Mr Hyde, after which he is sent by a secret church order to Transylvania to help the beautiful, perhaps equally deadly, princess of an old gypsy family, (Beckinsale), save her family from Purgatory by eliminating Count Dracula, (Roxborough). Monsters from just about every classic book are in this movie from Frankenstein's creature, werewoves, and more.<br /><br />The action sequences are stunning, and the special effects used to achieve them are amazing. Van Helsing comes fully laden with lots of nifty goodies that are not so nifty for monsters. There are also moments of suspense in places that keep you on the edge of your seat for a bit of time. The balance between plot development, suspence and good, old-fashioned action has been well struck, and suits the movie well. It hardly feels like a movie that is over two hours long.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is very suave and cool in the role of Van Helsing. Jackman brings a very real sense of style to the role, bringing out the intense pain of a man that is tortured by a past that he doesn't remember and a life that he seemingly has no control over. Little wonder the makers were set on Jackman from the start. Kate Beckinsale is truly sultry and beautiful as Anna Valerious. She truly carries the driven and almost fanatical feel of the character well, and she really lets the viewer see the intense emotions of a woman driven by loss.<br /><br />There were only two points on which I would criticise the movie in a small way. First, was that the love interest between Anna and Van Helsing was a little bit predictable and unnecessary to the plot overall. Having said that, I have to also concede that the tension between the two provided some needed light relief from the overall darkness of the movie. Secondly, is Roxborough's Dracula, who seemed a little non-evil. In contrast to people like Anthony Hopkins, (Hannibal Lector in "Silence of the Lambs"), who can just ooze brooding and malevolent evil of the deepest kind, Roxborough seemed a little like a school boy try-hard succeeding in only reaching "mildly bad". Dr Evil in "Austin Powers" might term him "diet evil".<br /><br />If you can, the twin DVD set is an excellent buy and worth the money for the added features. They have an extensive section on the effects, which is incredibly interesting. I found it noteworthy that the actor who played Frankenstein's monster, also doubled as the human model in the scenes with Mr Hyde, so that Jackman had someone to look at before they inserted images of the computer Hyde into the shot. I also thoroughly enjoyed the sections on the making of the film, which provided some very cool background to the movie, and the bloopers, which were quite amusing.<br /><br />For a monster movie full of action and gadgets, "Van Helsing" is hard to beat. I loved it, and have seen it a few times without getting bored. The criticisms above are relatively minor and should not discourage you from enjoying what is a classic tale with lots of action. A fantastic movie, indeed.</p></body></html>

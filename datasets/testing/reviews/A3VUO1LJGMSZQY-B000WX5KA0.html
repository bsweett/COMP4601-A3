<meta name="summary" content="Own  'collectors ed.';  blu upgrade?"></head><body><p>Have read numerous stellar reviews of new blu release: VERY tempted to re-purchase (in fact was still being contemplated in my cart until just a while ago!).  Decided to re-visit 2 dvd set, as basis for comparison (though just using others' comments to do so!), and was very surprised with how good THIS copy (still) looks! The 'grunge' factor of 1970's NYC (I believe) is well-represented, but the overall look is still impressive.  The upward look at the skyline, the gaunt face of Mr Bickle, the daytime exterior shots, are all very clean and crisp  -and undoubtedly benefit from the blu transfer-, but I am satisfied with this release (which also has a 2nd disc of 8 insightful featurettes, incl. a 70 min "making of", and several audio and subtitle options/commentaries on film itself). For those who do not yet own a copy, sure, get the blu (and the price is certainly competitive); but I will likely not, after having already invested $15 for this (IMHO high quality) standard def copy.</p></body></html>

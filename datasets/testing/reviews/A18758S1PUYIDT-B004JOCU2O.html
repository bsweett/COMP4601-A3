<meta name="summary" content="Good suspense thriller"></head><body><p>I want to find out what this was based on since apparently it really happened.  Nice job of location filming in PA, good performances from Denzel, Pine, and Dawson in the lead roles; suspenseful action sequences as a train rushes out of control down the tracks with perilous toxic cargo.<br /><br />Good action flick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Raised as a Catholic in the 60s and 70s?  Then Shanley's brilliant film will resonate deeply"></head><body><p>In various 'professional' reviews of John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his own hit play, I've read things like "Philip Seymour Hoffman goes toe to toe with Meryl Streep"..and "Amy Adams holds her own against Meryl Streep"..and "despite only being on the screen for 12 minutes, Viola Davis hangs with Meryl Streep."  Hmmmm [scratches chin]...what do these reactions all have in common?  Only that Meryl Streep is the measuring stick against whom all others are to be judged.  I guess it's passe to say directly that Meryl Streep is extraordinary.  Instead, everyone now puts her co-stars on some type of Streep-o-meter.  Needless to say, the best performance in a Meryl Streep movie is...Meryl Streep.  That's taken for granted some times.<br /><br />The movie itself is pure dynamite.  As someone who was raised as a Catholic in the 60s and attended a Catholic high school in the 70s, this movie resonated deeply with me.  One scene that stuck out: Shanley's juxtaposition of the prim, cloistered convent with its almost mute nuns, followed immediately by nothing less than the raucous cacophony of the rectory with its hard-drinking, garrulous priests.  This scene was pure genius and no doubt left many of my fellow Catholics of a certain age thrilled with such a realistic portrayal.  I raved to my wife after the film about absolute truth of that passage.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman nails his role here.  His character is believable as a mentor to the boys - the scene where he helps them shoot foul shots and answers some of their questions shows that mentoring side.  But Shanley's script is subtle and telling here, too, because we also get some of the character's quirkiness.  Hoffman shows the boys his clean nails and says "I like to keep them a little long."  Just enough to make you start thinking...</p></body></html>

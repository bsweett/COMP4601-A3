<meta name="summary" content="REVIEW for the new 2 DVD edition NOT the movie"></head><body><p>Hi Folks,<br />Being a huge fan of the original I missed this in theaters due to negative reviews..it isn't as bad as they made out...and is better than  much I've wasted my money on...all that said...the SINGLE DISC version is a much better deal in my opinion..<br /><br />the 5 bonus features on the second disc of this set..all add up to about 20 minutes!! There isn't a really solid "making of" to be found in this deluxe 2 disc edition. There was no need for a second disc for this skimpy bunch of nothing. The Digital copy is truly the ONLY reason for anyone to buy this version and that is what my review is about. There are plenty of reviews of the movie..but if you don't need the digital copy ..stick with the single disc edition..this bunch of truly nothing isn't worth your money..<br />OH..I almost forgot the annoying 1st disc special feature with the bonus 62% more "laughs" ...well the reason its annoying is that you can't simply choose this version..(which wouldn't make sense anyway as many of the additional laughs were versions of scenes cut or deleted for ones in the movie so we are seeing alternative versions of funny scenes) but have to have your remote in hand and instead of an icon which shows up on screen the whole picture freezes up and shows you an image of a remote and you then hit enter and see the additional laughs (or additional attempts  at laughs)..as if you can even remember where you were in the story after all that ...over and over and over...really not a viewing  option  for anyone  who isn't overly curious to see all  the less than stellar bi-product of the production to understand  why those  "laughs" never made the movie in the first place.<br /><br />I wish I'd have saved the money and purchased the single disc version.<br />you have been warned!</p></body></html>

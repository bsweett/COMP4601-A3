<meta name="summary" content="George A. Romero's original Dawn of the Dead"></head><body><p>Romero's ghastly sequel to his legendary "Night of the Living Dead" is equally brilliant and perhaps even more unsettling than the first installment. It is also spine-chillingly funny, making blunt comparisons between the dead-eyed, gore-loving zombies and vapid American consumers. (Next time you're at a mall, the impression will be hard to shake.) But for all its satirical wit, "Dead" also features riveting action sequences, culminating in the final showdown involving soldiers, bikers, and endless waves of the undead. Tom Savani's ghoulish effects are not for the faint of heart, so be sure you're in the mood for explicit slaughter.</p></body></html>

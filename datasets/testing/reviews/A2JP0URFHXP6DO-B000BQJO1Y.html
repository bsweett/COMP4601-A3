<meta name="summary" content="THE ULTIMATE ZOMBIE MOVIE!!!"></head><body><p>One thing about George Romero, he's not shy about milking his creations for all their worth.  God knows how many editions of Night of the Living Dead there are available in various collections or editions.<br /><br />First, lets just call it as it is.  Dawn of the Dead..the original is the greatest Zombie movie ever and one of the scariest movies ever.  Picking up after NOTLD, by now the Zombies have run rampant and people are fleeing wherever they can.<br /><br />A small group of four including two SWAT team members a TV reporter, and her helicopter pilot boyfriend flee the city, finally setting down on the roof of a large, suburban shopping mall.<br /><br />The soon realize that the mall has everything they need to sustain them including shelter, food, water, even a bank loaded with cash just in case man survives.  But first, they must clean the mall of hundreds of zombies who roam the halls because the mall was an important place in their life.<br /><br />The four go on a hunt and destroy mission to first seal the doors to the mall and block them with large semi-trucks.  Then they kill off all the zombies in the mall and our living a life of relative ease when a rogue group of bikers led by make-up guru Tom Savini comes storming into the mall to loot it.<br /><br />With the mall now filled with zombies again the four have to fight off the zombies and bikers.<br /><br />Savini is at the top of his game giving us incredible and incredibly gory effects like the face exploding from the shotgun, the top of a zombie head being sheared off by a chopper blade, and various scenes of entrails being torn out from still living victims and eaten by the zombies.<br /><br />To some extent, now 25 years later or so the effect look a bit dated.  The blood in parts looks more like red paint but still this is one great movie and the one which all other zombie movies must compare to.<br /><br />It is far better than the recent remake and superior to the sequel "Day of the Dead".  Again, while we have no big name actors, those we do do a comendable job and do not seem as amateurish as in the Night or Day.<br /><br />The ultimate edition will have 3 cuts of the movie.  The theatrical release, the Directors cut and the European cut.  Each of these will have separate audio commentary tracks.<br /><br />The 4th disk is filled with extras including documentaries, interviews, stills, and more.  It really is the Ultimate edition!</p></body></html>

It's the only way to get the original, untampered with '82 version of this classic film.<br /><br />Yes, here it is! There are no menancing walkie-talkies being wavered around in the air. This is E.T. as it was meant to be!<br /><br />Shame on you Mr. Spielberg for not making this version available outside the deluxe gift box set.</p></body></html>

However, that kind of staging would be near impossible to film, and the movie adds characters (like the young boy Donald who is the source of the conflict) and a church full of congregents. The movie is still a heavy, densely wordy affair, but the inclusiuon of more bodies and business dilutes the ambiguity, or the "doubt" as it were.<br /><br />However, when you have Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman turning in their most ferociously thesbian performances possible, "Doubt" still comes out as a really good movie. Both Amy Adams as the innocent (who utters the scene stealing line above) and Viola Davis (who torpedoes the self-rightous certainty of Sister Aloysius with the rules of the world) as the mother who will protect her son through any or all make deeply impressive supporting appearances, and all work with John Patrick Shanley's fine adaptation of his original play. Togther, these folks were all nominated for Oscars, that is how good each individual is here.<br /><br />Streep, as Sister Aloysius Beauvier, takes that crusty old nun that everyone remembers from Sunday School and infuses her with both wit, wisdom and Nunly Facism. Hoffman's Father Flynn is the new breed of Priest, a big Catholic teddy bear who thinks the church must become more human and humane, but Sister Aloysius sees that as both weak and suspect. When she sees Father Flynn acting with (what she sees as) undue compassion towards the new kid, she decides to drive him out of the church at all costs...even if so much of her certainty may be flawed by her mistrust of change.<br /><br />At a very taut 100 minutes, "Doubt" works both as an indictment of the scandals within the Catholic Church and as an allegory to the modern day, when "Change" became a buzzword in the making of a war and a new president. Viola Davis, with maybe 10 minutes of screentime, tears all of the arguments into shreads, making the theme of doubt in the movie play right into the ambiguous ending. Powerful stuff and worthy of all its awards and nominations.</p></body></html>

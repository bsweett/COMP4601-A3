In books I expect the story to stir up the images but in movies it's the visuals that rock my world, and the story follows closely behind.<br /><br /> This movie surely had my eyes  and my mind captivated from start to finish. The story as far fetched as it was didn't throw me off, as I followed Violet, played by Milla Jovovich who in my mind was born to play quirky high combat characters, and her team of friends and foes as the so called, Blood Wars fed life cycles of modern Earth. She  is on a  mission which  I will not give away, but  that  mission makes her angry,  unstoppable and out for blood as she flew, drove , kicked, shot, sliced though and propelled herself again st laws of gravity towards her goal. The colors, liquid metallics, flying  scraps of matter,  bullets, heart stopping stunts and  her motorbike skills left me with my  mouth open and my brain entertained in a way that  is hard for most movies.  I have never seen the Ultraviolet comics but this movie was swimming in special effects so collaborative that all fantastic movies now have more to struggle against as this set new standards .<br /><br />I know I  might have more unusual liking for movies than the majority, and as many people didn't seem to like it, I have to  say that this was wonderful and intense  beyond what I expected. The music by Klaus  Badelt was just as magnificent  and will have to go on top of my movie scores list. Great movie,  as long as seen with an open mind and total openness for some fantastic butt kicking as it blends  Kill Bill, The Matrix,  Aliens and  all my favorite super heroes into one.</p></body></html>

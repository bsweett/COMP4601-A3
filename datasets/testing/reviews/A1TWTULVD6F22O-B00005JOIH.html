<meta name="summary" content="Struggling between 3 and 4 stars...it ultimately left me disappointed."></head><body><p>In 1972, the world was shocked at an act of terrorism played out on the world stage of the Munich Olympics, when a group of Arab terrorists, known as Black September, kidnapped the Israeli Olympic team from their rooms in the Olympic village, and ultimately killed them all.<br /><br />Faced with this act, and after their defeat of their enemies in the 1967-1969 struggle for their homeland against Arab foes, the country of Israel decides to seek retribution against the 11 men who were involved in the planning of the killings. They struggle with the decision, and the principal of seeking vengeance, but decide they must. They choose, as their instrument, a young Sabra, born in Israel to a hero of Israeli independence. Avram (played by Eric Bana), the young Israeli, was once a bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir. He is impeccably well trained and trustworthy. He absorbs with aplomb the news that he is to be an assassin, to lead an assassination team for the Mossad, and that he will be disavowed by his government if he is caught. His team, four men, is provided to him, along with copious amounts of money to complete his task. His handler, Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush in another brilliant performance) is imperious and demanding.<br /><br />The story is absorbing, the nature of the events shocking, the performances supporting Bana's are very well done. Bana himself is a revelation, and this film should make him a household word.  He is marvelous in his role.  Spielberg ultimately elects NOT to present the film as a justification for what Israel did, but a message about the consequences of seeking an eye for an eye.  He plants seeds of doubt throughout the film, and it is obvious that he has either struggled with his belief that what was done was necessary, OR, he may support what was done, but just want to be more politically correct in delivering his message...that violence to cure violence never works.<br /><br />I think Spielberg has produced a fine film, and perhaps one worthy of four stars and a whole lot of heated conversation about the outcomes.  The violence is shocking, the message is somewhat unclear...the film runs long, but it is ultimately a thriller of the highest standing, with an ending that leaves the filmgoer unsatisfied.<br /><br />But I'm giving the film three stars, and that is reflective of the overall effort, less the absolutely appalling scene where the final film of what happened to the Israeli Olympics team is interspersed with Avram's reunion with his wife in their bed.  I found the juxtaposition of these film slices to be the most shameless and ridiculous film stunt I've seen in a long, long time.  Spielberg should be ashamed of this contrivance.  And this single episode far and away detracts from what should have been an important film.<br /><br />While dodging the bullets of his detractors who will cry false at the "violence never works" precept, Spielberg did the unthinkable; allowed himself to edit and present in a way that absolutely cheapened the overall effort.  Disappointing.</p></body></html>

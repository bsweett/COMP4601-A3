You feel at the same time at one with nature, and isolated and insignificant in its grandeur.<br /><br />So I found visual thrills in this movie, but unfortunately not the thrill of any real love story. Yes, there can be tacit love. And yes, cowboys are notoriously taciturn. But there's a limit. Ultimately, human love has to be built on some words, on some shared history, on some weaving of one's individual biography into a shared narrative. And there is none of that here.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is so choked back and nonverbal in his roll as Ennis that I at first had to turn on the English subtitles to my DVD to catch what few words he is mumbling. There doesn't seem to be any point beyond the sexual in being with someone like him. He has no enlarging view to offer, no wit, no sustaining support. And the Jack Twist character isn't much better.<br /><br />But the men's failure as lovers goes beyond their inarticulateness. If you truly love someone, you carry a lamp glowing inside you. You see reflections of that person in everyone you meet and so you confer that spark to all your encounters in life. You bring that spark to everything you do. It sustains and animates you. It makes you want to perfect. And there was none of that here.<br /><br />To the contrary, the two men make the lives of their everyday spouses and girlfriends a misery by their inexplicable unavailability, their withdrawal and lack of essential interest. They are always elsewhere. They are always frozen in disaffection for the ones with whom they might really have forged some bond, albeit not a bond based on any sexual urgency.<br /><br />Lust aches. Love lightens. So this relationship never much gets beyond lust. Instead of carrying their forbidden love as a secret charm that could radiate, the two men in this movie schlep through their days spreading a sort of emotional blight wherever they go. Instead of being a tragedy about how prejudice prevented two people from being together, the overriding tragedy of this movie is how often people can't get beyond specific sexual craving in order to joyfully abide in the life that is proffered to them.<br /><br />Finally, were the namings of these two characters (Ennis and Twist) a little too suggestive? I didn't read the Annie Proulx short story on which this movie is based. So I don't know if her original characters had these names. If they did, it seems to undermine any serious, heartfelt intent for the story. By the unlikely coincidence of these men having Stud Magazine names, it in fact seems to reduce and doom their relationship from the outset to - just sex.</p></body></html>

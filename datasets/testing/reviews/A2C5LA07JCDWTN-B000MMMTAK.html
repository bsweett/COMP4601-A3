<meta name="summary" content="Sacha Baron Cohen should win Best Actor for Borat...Seriously"></head><body><p>I had heard the hype about this movie being ridiculously funny and didn't really believe it could live up to it's lofty expectations. But, let tell you Borat is the funniest movie I have EVER seen. That is a pretty strong statement but it is true. I have never laughed harder or longer than I did during this film. You would have to see Borat at least 10 times to get all of the jokes, there are just too many funny parts. Just a few highlights include Borat and Azamat wrestling nude, Borat and Azamat staying at a bed and breakfast with Jews, Borat inviting a black overweight prostitute to a stuffy southern ministers house and of course the Pam Anderson bit. The thing that makes Borat so funny is that all of his victims are real people who are unaware that they are being exposed as either racist or sexist idiots. If Sacha Baron Cohen is not nominated for an Oscar and does not win for this role, then no comedic role will ever win an Oscar. Baron Cohen is absolutely flawless and relentless as the mock Kazack (sp?) reporter. The scene where Borat and Azamat crash a mortgage broker's seminar nude and start wrestling on the stage is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life. There are only a handful of times in my life that I can say I've experienced a life-altering event but Borat is one of those moments. This movie will stay with me for the rest of my life. An absolute instant classic and the funniest movie ever made. Highest recommendation possible.</p></body></html>

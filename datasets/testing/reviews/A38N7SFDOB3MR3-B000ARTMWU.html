<meta name="summary" content="Strange Twist but Good Film. 61 out of 100."></head><body><p>High Tension is a well-made horror movie with a strange twist. Without giving out spoilers, 2 college girls travel to a remote farm where they encounter a gruesome and relentless killer. The twist is unique, but like too many horror movies, the twist is showcased and takes away from the film's congruency a little too much.<br /><br />The pacing in this film is very good, and the fear and scare levels get quite high. I was on the edge of my seat quite often.<br /><br />While I would recommend seeing this movie, it is not without flaws. Any scenes with dialogue are very poorly acted and come off as phony filler. But, the acting when these isn't any dialogue is top notch. Ma?wenn Le Besco is wonderful at the end, and you feel her terror and fear quite well, despite the fact that her interaction with C&eacute;cile De France at the beggining of the film seems very poorly acted.<br /><br />Also, the ending isn't foreshadowed good enough for my liking, which is a disappointment. Soem scenes in the movie flat out make no sense whatsoever. There is a scene with the killer in a truck playing with a severed head. This scene, after viewing the end of the movie, seems pointless.<br /><br />Again, with these flaws, the movie is still origianl and scary enough that I highly recommend seeing it. The setting, scenery and murder sequels are brutal, intense and incredibly terrorizing. I was entertained by High Tension, and would  watch it again. I still think Wolf Creek was a little better.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 61<br /><br />33 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

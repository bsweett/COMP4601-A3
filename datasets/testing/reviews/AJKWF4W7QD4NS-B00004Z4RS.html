<meta name="summary" content="The best comic book movie adaption since Batman"></head><body><p>Everything about this movie is great, special effects, storyline, and the casting as well.  Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, and my God can he play him great.  Patrick Stewart is Professor X (naturally), and he is great as well.  This is the start of a dynasty since a sequel is in the works.  I just hope it doesn't end up like the Batman series.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Effective chiller"></head><body><p>"Emily" gives the impression of being a courtroom thriller based on a true story of exorcism-gone-bad.  In this case, a noble if small-town priest played by Tom Wilkinson ("In the Bedroom") tries to drive out a mob of nasty Latin-speaking demons from the mortal form of Emily Rose...or so he says once he's charged with negligent homicide following her death.  Laura Linney is the up-and-coming attorney assigned to defend him.  A non-believer herself, Linney's courtroom adversary (a shockingly aged Campbell Scott) is a small-town prosecutor whose devout churchgoing makes him more disposed to hanging the priest than sparing him.  Back-tracking with witnesses, we see the horrific visions suffered by Emily - was she an epilectic/psychotic as proposed by a prosecutor's expert witness (Henry Czerny), or is this "the real deal"?  Linney's case is the priest, but her actual client is the Church itself, and the archdiocese wants the case settled quickly, with no question of the accused priest testifying.<br /><br />In that vein, "Emily" could have been an effective courtroom drama, one exploring the ethical implications of being the attorney for both a Church and one of its cast-out members at the same time, and leaving enough room on the subject of the supernatural so that we could go either way.  However, though making inroads in that direction, "Emily" decides to go the Hollywood route - Linney gamely goes after an impassioned defense, and more critically, the film leaves little doubt of where it stands on the authenticity of the supernatural - when Emily sees something, we see it; and when soembody else sees Emily (but presumably not her terrifying visions) we see her visions anyway; The priest has some visions as well, and the script never considers making Wilkinson's character unsympathetic enough to doubt.  Finally, Linney has too many of her own episodes at "The Witching Hour" (3 AM, if you must know), which include a locked front door that is nevertheless wide open and a dictaphone that plays by itself.  "Emily" is definately a chiller...<br /><br />...that manages to work.  Though using a fair amount of CGI and other effects, "Emily" remains on top by its use of effective pacing and its resolute intentions to remain first and foremost a movie about people who are in fear rather than fear itself - everybody looks like their scared, and the script gives them adequate reason to, so why shouldn't we.  Ironically, the movie is almost at its scariest when asking us to ocnsider Emily's condition as purely rational - meaning that it's entirely reasonable for her (and us) to be forced into all manner of painful and bone-breaking contortions while her pupils dilate and her mind is full of visions of demons.  "Exorcist" was scary enough when we thought it was fiction, but scenes of Emily lying on the floor, her limbs in odd directions, suggest a colder and clinical diagnosis for which there is no salvation or the protective cushion of CGI.  Though no horror film has yet topped "Exorcist", "Emily" remains a movie about demonic possession that actually grabs you.</p></body></html>

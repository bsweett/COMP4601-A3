<meta name="summary" content="Too many missed opportunities keep this from being funny"></head><body><p>After watching "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," it is clear to me that the funniest television anchorman of all-time remains Ted Baxter on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show."  I say this knowing that for the most part I could not stand the Ted Baxter character and while I was not exactly wincing at the one-liners in this 2004 comedy, I was not laughing a lot either.  The script by director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell sets up some comic opportunities but tends not to take advantage of them.  For example, it is established early on that Burgundy will say anything that is written on a teleprompter.  While this comes up as a major plot development, it strikes me as a waste of a really good running gag because they could have come up with so much more.<br /><br />Ron Burgundy represents the news anchor in his prime, circa San Diego in the 1970s.  Arrogant and narcissistic, not to mention incapable of saying anything that does not sound pompous and egotistical, Burgundy is enabled by his producer Ed Harken (Fred Willard), and the rest of the evening news team: hip roving reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner), and clueless weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell, Bruce Almighty).  Into their male dominated world comes Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who wants to read the news her self, apparently unconcerned that it is a man's job.  Thus, the battle lines are drawn between Veronica and all of the guys as the station.<br /><br />Now, a battle of the sexes sounds pretty good, but that idea is undercut by the fact that a romance springs up between Burgundy and Corningstone.  The fact that they have the hots for each other does not take away from their ambition, and the funniest scenes for me in the film are when the two of them are muttering insults each other at the end of the newscast while the credits role.  But there should have been a lot more comedy to be milked from their on camera battles, and "Anchorman" is to busy running on to the next bit to stop and figure out how everything fits together.  This is a film that has people singing "Afternoon Delight" at one moment and then has news teams getting ready to rumble in a back alley.  But it never comes together with any sort of unified comedy theory that makes it all work.  Instead we are left with bits and pieces with as many misses as hits.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" should have been a satire, and it ends up being nothing more than an over-extended comedy sketch.  The movie is set in the 1970s and you would think that should come into play more in terms of the comedy, but it really does not.  The flaw, I suspect, is that McKay and Ferrell know that their SNL audience has little in the way of a rudimentary knowledge of that particular decade (to wit, leisure suits and facial hair), so the story is set back then simply so the idea of a female news anchor can be see as a radical idea.  But even that become another font of comic opportunity that "Anchorman" neglects to use to great effect.  The result is okay, and Ferrell certainly tries hard, but for me the entire movie has as many laughs as one of his really good SNL skits, and when you are talking a feature length movie, that is not a good thing.</p></body></html>

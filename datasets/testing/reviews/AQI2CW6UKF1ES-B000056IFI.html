But the machines refuse to go out like some chumps.  They send a rithless machine, the T-model 101(Arnold Schwarzenegger to waste her like a coke can.  This is the only time you'll see Arnold as a ruthless mo'fo but it's undeniebly an unforgettable performance.  But the humans send one of their own, a human who knows the situation.  Cyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sent to protect her, but the million dollar question is, can they do it, or will they be ruthlessly slaughtered by the heartless machine.<br /><br />The one thing I like about this film, is the fear it presents.  It seems nothing that Cyle and Sarah do can stop him, not even a police force of 30 men with shotguns and assult rifles even stalled this baaaaad dude.  It makes the Terminator feel almost invincible.  Even the dated special effects at the end, where the terminator looked fake, made him look scary.  If he moved realistic, I dunno, but with him moving fake, accually mad him look scarier.<br /><br />Arnold in this one is the scariest out of the terminators, because the protagonist wasn't a machine, but a human.  T-1000 is the best because liquid metal seemed nearly indutuctable.  The T-X is just, well T3 shouldn't have even been made.  I mean T3 made the hairstyles on the wemon in this film look sexy(Well maybe)<br /><br />James Camron's carrer was made, and Arnold's carrer skyrocketed way up.  This may have been low budgeted, but high hearted.  This film is second to the clerverly made sequal that continued the plot so flawlessly, and this film makes T3 look like junk.  Anyone who loves sci-fi or horror, go check this out.  Anyone who saw T2 but not this, need to check out the begininer.<br /><br />peace</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HORRIBLE movie!"></head><body><p>Pretty much everyone I know raves about this movie, and after finally seeing it for myself, the only thing I can safely conclude is that pretty much everyone I know has god-awful taste in movies. "Bridesmaids" is AWFUL! There are a few...A FEW funny lines/ moments, but they are few and far between. The film is mostly gross humor, which I hate, and most of the characters are vain and self-absorbed and I absolutely hated all of them. What bothers me the most is that Melissa McCarthy received an Oscar nomination for taking a dump in a bathroom sink.  That just goes to show how far the Academy's standards have fallen. Ugh.</p></body></html>

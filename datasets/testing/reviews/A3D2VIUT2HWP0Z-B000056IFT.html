As for comparing TOTAL RECALL and  BLADE RUNNER... well, talk about Apples and Oranges; I like both, but for different  reasons.<br /><br />I saw the VHS  version eons ago, and remember when the special edition DVD came out in the little "Mars Shaped"  tin container. Almost as weird as the FRIGHT NIGHT VHS case shaped like a Coffin, but quite a nifty idea( However, Video rental Stores Hated it for display reasons).<br />From Years of watching the VHS version, I had a very distinct opinion about the film... I thought it was a straight action flick. Well, the first thing that the commentary  does is to disabuse you of that idea. Verhoeven has very grand ideas about his film-making, and by any standards, this film is at the least, a multi-layered work.<br />Whilst I can appreciate the subtext, and "intertextual" elements of academic books, its not much fun if you just want to escape in a film. Thats why this film works superbly if someone does not actually  TELL you that its not what you think it is ... as in the NAME OF THE ROSE ( both Book and film there are very layered).<br />For my money, if a film cannot entertain you, then its not what I want. Some films serve a different purpose, so if I watch a programme about the Psychoanalytic elements behind the death of Civilisations, I expect to work hard at understanding the work. Or Even a film ABOUT  "Schrodingers Cat" ( that is not about how to train a wayward  feline ) would be something I could halfway expect to be a work requiring some mental effort.<br /><br />The R  rated version of this film is right on the money, and provides great FX, and lots of fun. The M rated version is a waste of time in my view, and also has some very stupid edits, the sort of stuff that appears on the evening news, but has to be cut because of MPAA rules.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the commentary occurs when we find out HOW Verhoeven gets to be the man in the mix.<br />If Arnold can be said to be anything, it would seem that deal broker is definitely part of his resume.<br /><br />If the old adage in the making of movies is that 90% of your effort is put into finding work, then Arnold does this well...  even if some say he cannot act :-).... At the Very least, one can say that he entertains. For my money, I think he can act,  either that, or I just enjoy Arnolds'  antics.</p></body></html>

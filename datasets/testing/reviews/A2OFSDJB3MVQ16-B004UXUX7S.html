<meta name="summary" content="Clooney and Payne create a masterpiece"></head><body><p>I was pleasantly surprised to find myself absorbed in this fine drama/comedy starring George Clooney in another fine performance with fine direction from Alexander Payne, who waited several years before committing to this film--but the wait was worth it.  Another plus of course is the Hawaiian background since I lived there many moons ago but again the story is the key here plus the acting especially from the Shaleen Woodley who should've copped an Oscar nom for her supporting role as Clooney's wayward daughter.  It's a shame that "The Artist" overtook this fine film but I think the Academy was patting itself on the back for giving it to that French film rather than this masterpiece.</p></body></html>

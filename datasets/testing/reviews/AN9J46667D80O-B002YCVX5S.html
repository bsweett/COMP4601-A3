It centers around all sorts of goings-on during WWII with a plot that's incredibly intricate and nastily violent.<br /><br />The movie features several stories that eventually lock together. You've got the Nazi "Jew Hunter",played by Christoph Waltz (in one of the best performances of the year. Before seeing this I was prepared to say the Best Supporting Actor win would go to Christian McKay for his performance in "Me and Orson Welles". Now I'm not so sure), a Jewish woman (M&eacute;lanie Laurent)who survived a massacre of her family led by the "Jew Hunter" (what is that in German? "Juden Jaeger", I assume), and then, almost as an afterthought, you've got an American guerrilla group led by one Lt Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who offers one of the most hilarious moments in the film when he speaks Italian with a very thick Tennessee accent.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the plot without giving away huge parts of the movie. Suffice to say the Basterds are sent across enemy lines to wreak havoc against the Nazis (which they do rather graphically). Meantime the Jew Hunter is oozing his way across the landscape and the Jewish woman he failed to kill is running a movie theatre. When the Nazis decide to premiere a movie there, she makes plans to blow it up.<br /><br />As usual with Tarantino, there's lots of blood and gore, plus plenty of references to other movies. The soundtrack is like a Spaghetti Western, there's an appearance by Emil Jannings, references to the works of Leni Riefenstahl and mention of the great German film studio UFA. Left out are comments on the works of Murnau and Lang, but given the Nazi view of Lang especially, that's no great surprise.<br /><br />As mentioned the movie tells several stories all at once. It is a testament to Tarantino as a filmmaker that I never once felt lost and that the stories come together in a way that seems quite natural.<br /><br />I'm no great Tarantino fanboy. "Reservoir Dogs" and "Kill Bill" (both parts), remain to me some of the most overrated films in history. I didn't like either one. On the other hand, "Pulp Fiction" and "Jackie Brown" are two of my all-time favorite films, so there you go.<br /><br />The DVD extras include some deleted scenes (though fewer than you'd expect), as well as trailers and a six-minute short film done in the style of Riefenstahl. It's less interesting than one might want.<br /><br />Ultimately I recommend this movie. It's a tad on the violent side (to put it mildly), but well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

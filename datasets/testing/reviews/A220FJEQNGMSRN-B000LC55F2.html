The Prestige may have inexplicably missed out on a screen writing nomination at the Oscars, but it's one of the best screen adaptations in years, its excellent and ingenious script displaying confidence both in its potentially outrageous material and its audiences' intelligence, hiding all the answers in plain sight from the very first shot. Even the dialogue pulls off the triple feat of being rich with double meanings which repay repeat viewing, right for each scene it appears in and, far from being clever just for the sake of it, naturally furthering the plot and the characters in entertaining and intriguing ways. But then, half the trick is making it look effortless (although in an inversion of that, both the film's on screen magicians are so accomplished they have to make their illusions look harder than they are to get the audience's approval).<br /><br />Either deceptively elaborate or deceptively simple (either definition applies, and each in their most positive sense), Christopher Nolan's tale of duelling magicians manages to be both highly entertaining and surprisingly dark: this isn't a war of words, but one where people get hurt, fingers get lost, people die. The film is full of mirroring and doubling, so it's not surprising that the magicians' feud mirrored by Nikola Tesla's equally dangerous feud with Thomas Edison over the electricity that may or may not be the key to the mystery - if there even is a mystery.<br /><br />Magic is the perfect metaphor for both storytelling and movie-making - in a way the film could almost be an allegory about why movie buffs usually make the worst movies. Each protagonist is an incomplete man in every sense of the word. Bale has the genius but not the ability to sell his illusions to an audience. Jackman has the showmanship but not the originality to create a truly great trick. In the middle is Michael Caine's ingeneur, the backstage genius with the surprisingly unconvincing cockney accent (too many years of high living, Michael?), caught somewhere between director and ghost writer in the scheme of things.<br /><br />Not that it's without flaws. It is perhaps too easy to guess Bale's big personal secret simply by the manner Nolan chooses to shoot certain shots, although there are more than enough twists not for it to matter too much if you don't get them all. And, in another part that shows up Scarlet Johannson's weaknesses as an actress, the nominal leading lady is effortlessly outshone by Rebecca Hall and, yes, Piper Perabo in smaller roles. Still, Nolan does manage to pull off the amazing feat of getting an excellent performance out of David Bowie, through the obvious-now-you-think-about-it technique of focussing on the singer's voice as much as his natural presence.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's a film that could be about everything or about absolutely nothing, one that is either led entirely by plot contrivances or one where the themes and storytelling dictate the characters' actions far more than credibility, and where the biggest trick is that ultimately there is no trick. All interpretations seem equally valid, which is part of the fun. And best of all, it's a delight to watch.<br /><br />The DVD extras are, for once on a Nolan film, disappointingly mundane, but it's worth picking up for the film itself.</p></body></html>

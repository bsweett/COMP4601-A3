I saw it at a matinee showing last weekend.<br /><br />I have to say, I was somewhat disappointed, in comparison to the original. It was difficult to put my finger on why, exactly...at least at first. In the past week, here's what I've noted.<br /><br />I enjoyed the supporting cast's performances more than that of the three primary stars....with one notable exception. I was happy to see Jack Davenport (of Coupling fame) put in a great performance as Norrington. The actors playing the pirates put in great comedic and supporting efforts. Bill Nighy continues to impress me; in this case, he's able to put emotion on the screen through all of that costuming, by his voice alone.<br /><br />Tom Hollander, who plays the villian Beckett, was the lone supporting cast who didn't really pull through here. You just know that a good smack to the head, and he'd just cave...which is not how he's really intended to portray the character.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom...either he's playing woodenly, or his character is written one-dimensionally, or both. I know if my love were threatened, I'd act with a little more depth of emotion than Bloom brings to the screen here.<br /><br />Keira's one of the saving graces...not just because she's easy on the eyes, but because she can portray emotion, and emotional changes, and because she sells her character as a match in wits against Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />And then there's Johnny...a great job, right up until his last scene.<br /><br />So, this brings us to the plot. It's too linear. The first film in this trilogy had a complex storyline, because the A story and the B story were given equal weight. Here, there's almost no weight put upon the B story. And, there are no real twists, at least not until the very end.<br /><br />I'd recommend the movie...it's light summer fare, great for the kids and to beat the heat. But, it's not as hefty as the original, so be prepared.</p></body></html>

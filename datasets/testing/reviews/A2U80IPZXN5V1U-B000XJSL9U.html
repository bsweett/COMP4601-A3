<meta name="summary" content=""True To The Die Hard Franchise""></head><body><p>Its been 12 years since 1995's Die Hard 3:Die Hard With A Vengeance,the fourth Die Hard movie "Live Free Or Die Hard" comes out after all that time.12 years separate these two movies and that made some fans nervous about this fourth Die Hard,still Bruce Willis said that if he receved a good script for a fourth movie he might just play the part of John McClane once again.Most fans tought that would never happen but it did and in June 2007,"Live Free Or Die Hard" was released in movie theatres.After all those years since the last movie,is the fourth Die Hard movie really worth seing?Can Bruce Willis still handle the role of John McClane?<br /><br />The answer to both question is "yes!" and this new Die Hard movie does a fantastic job of incorporating a classic movie franchise into our actual decade and time.Something that few classic franchises have been able to do as of now.You can tell right way that movie is "current",because the technology,computers and all and they did make John McClane look older for this movie and he has moved on with his life as well he hasn't stayed the exact same person.Its mostly an action movie in the style of the other Die Hard films but this time around there is some humor in it.It is a great addition to the Die Hard series and a damn good one too!Its definatly not a cash cow,its true to the franchise.<br /><br />The storyline is captivating enough so that even people who have never heard of or seen any of the Die Hard movies can like it enough to appreciate what a good movie "Live Free Or Die Hard" is.The movie starts with the attack of what could be called cyber-terrorists and hackers on the U.S. Infrastructure that sets the path for John McClane to come in action.He quickly meets Matthew Farrell a young hacker who he thinks can help him.Matthew Farrel's role does add an element of comedy in the movie,wich fits well in this movie but not pushing the humor too much that its not an action movie.New director Len Wiseman was certainly up to the task of making a great third sequel to Die Hard.<br /><br />If you wanted action you've got it,as troughout the movie there are a few great action scenes such as the shootout in Matthew's appartement early in the movie,or the latter part when John blows up a helicopter with a car wich was shown in the previews as well.The action sequences are great from anyone's point of view it makes you wonder how they made them so good.Oh and add to that the fact that John's daughter who refuses to talk to him and call him "dad" has been captured by the terrorists,and what you get is a pi**ed of John McClane!Sure to please any fans.<br /><br />In the past years there has not been many action movies that really stand out that much,sure there are a few good ones but Die Hard is pretty much the peak of action movies.This fourth movie proves that Die Hard is still strong and able to make a movie based on what could be some current events.After seeing this you will want to own all Die Hard movies and this fourth movie is probably not the best of the series but its a very good film that is worth seing.Its packed with action and true to the Die Hard franchise.I give it a Five Star rating.</p></body></html>

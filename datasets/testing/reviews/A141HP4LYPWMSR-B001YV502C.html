<meta name="summary" content=""The World Has Collapsed, Britain Soldiers On" ~ The Power Of A Child"></head><body><p>`Children of Men' released in '07 presents the viewer a grim, sobering vision of a future world quickly moving towards certain extinction. The year is 2027 and the earth is devoid of children. No one knows for sure why women suddenly became infertile, but it has now been years since the last birth. Without a new generation to replace the old the human race will soon cease to exist. With no tomorrow to look forward society has broken up into various warring factions and chaos runs wild in the streets. In an attempt to maintain some semblance of order a totalitarian government rules England, a regime no better than the factions opposing it.<br /><br />All appears lost until one man stumbles upon a possible hope for the future. Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is asked to help escort a young woman out of the city to a place of safety. At first hesitate to get involved in a stranger's affairs, everything changes when he discovers her all important secret. She's pregnant.<br /><br />`Children of Men' delivers excellent production values, a unique storyline and great performances by Clive Owen and Michael Caine. It's a little heavy-handed in metaphor and symbolic imagery, but overall a well done, highly imaginative film that provides both action/adventure and thought provoking drama. Well worth a watch or two.</p></body></html>

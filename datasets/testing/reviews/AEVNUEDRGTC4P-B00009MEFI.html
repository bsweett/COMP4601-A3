It plays like a vulgar movie length episode of the Twilight Zone.  Colin Farrell turns in the performance of his life as the sleazy PR guy.  On the other hand, Kiefer Sutherland fails to be a menacing enough phone caller and that dampens the fear factor in this flick.<br /><br />Given the profound lack of originality in Hollywood, any time a half way original movie such as Phone Booth comes our way, you simply have to at least consider giving it a try.</p></body></html>

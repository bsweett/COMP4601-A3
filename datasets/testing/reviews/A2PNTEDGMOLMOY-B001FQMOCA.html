<meta name="summary" content="Phoenix and Witherspoon elevate good, if conventional, biopic"></head><body><p>I have never been a big fan of Johnny Cash.  I know, I know, that makes me a Philistine.  But his baritone never did much for me, and his hallowed status has always been thrust upon me by his many indignant fans.  Something about the Man in Black makes his most ardent fans want to fight to defend the man and his music.<br /><br />I mention this only to say that I was not really looking forward to "Walk the Line," the biopic that does for Cash what "Ray" did for Ray Charles.  The similarities between these two men and the two movies are striking.  Both feature heroes raised literally dirt-poor, teaching themselves music, making it big, and inflicting damage on themselves and others through colossal substance abuse.  And along the way, they make some of the most beloved music America has produced.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix plays the grown-up Cash, and he nails it.  Cash, with his deep voice and brawler's physique, may be one of the most difficult of artists to channel, but Phoenix does it well.  Initially, Cash struggles as he tries to form an old-timey gospel trio.  But his life is transformed when a music agent tells him, sing like you've got one song left to sing, and God's going to hear it.  Cash responds to this challenge by belting out "Fulsom Prison Blues," and finding the Johnny Cash sound - "strong as a train and sharp as a razor."  That Phoenix does all his own singing, and does it well, is a plus to his fine acting job.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, a daughter in the Carter family of country music royalty.  On the radio since she was 4, she unwittingly inspires Cash, who listens to her on his old radio as a boy.  As adults, they find themselves on tour, and despite missteps and mis-marriages, an undeniable romance blossoms between these two best friends.  One wonders what she saw in the Man in Black, since he spends several years in a wasteland of drugs and booze . . . and yet while June walks away from time to time, Cash never leaves her heart.  And Witherspoon captures Carter's spunk and devotion, and provides another example of an actress who can really sing.<br /><br />This is powerful stuff, if conventional.  You don't go to "Walk the Line" to see anything original - you go because these are two lives that tell one great story.  And great it is.</p></body></html>

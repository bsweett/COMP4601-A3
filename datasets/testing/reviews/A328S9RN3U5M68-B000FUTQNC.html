<meta name="summary" content="Another 'Harrison Ford Saves the Day' Tale, but with a Fine Cast"></head><body><p>The story behind FIREWALL is just another variation of the 'thrillers' that made Harrison Ford popular: that is not a put down because Ford created a 'character type' that has been highly successful in generating a lot of movies light of weight in script but heavyweight in excitement.<br /><br />FIREWALL updates Ford's persona (though his physical presence now strains credibility that he could have young kids involved) to that of a computer expert, the man employed by a major back whom everybody loves and who just happens to be a top flight security brain protecting the bank's assets.  At a meeting with a potential investor (Paul Bettany) our hero is kind and casual only to be kidnapped by Bettany and taken to his home where his wife (Virginia Madsen) and children are being held ransom by Bettany's crew (including handsome Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who costarred with Bettany in 'Wimbledon'). The aim: get Ford to gain access into the bank's assets and transfer the funds to Bettany's off shore account. How this all tediously works out is the movies plot.<br /><br />An odd factor here: there are numerous famous actors in bit parts (Alan Arkin, Robert Forster, Robert Patrick) that seem like PR padding.  The script is flimsy, the plot wanders, the outcome is obvious, but Harrison Ford, Paul Bettany, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and Virginia Madsen prove that good actors can overcome weak material, even in formulaic films such as this.

This is an epic film on a small scale. It is subtle, reverent and quiet, ever so quiet! I try to never compare a novel to a film or visa versa. They are just two completely different mediums of telling a story and each has its strengths. This film is a visual delight. Tom Hanks' performance is one of the most restrained I have ever seen for a main character in a film yet he maintains control by the nature of his well-defined character. Ian McKellen is quite the flamboyant counterpart to Hanks, yet who comes off best at the conclusion being the most levelheaded? Jean Reno gives a very restrained and dedicated performance and one of true conviction to his character, which helps this film immensely. Hans Zimmer's score is once again on target and he seems to be getting better with each film. This is a story of fiction and a good one. It felt good to sit down and just savor each scene instead of being assaulted by extravagant in-your-face explosions and noise. I truly liked this film.</p></body></html>

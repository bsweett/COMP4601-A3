The first thing you find amazing and very scary is that these undead aren't the slow walking/stumbling kind but well actually give chase to whoever they are after which is a real kick in the nuts for the survivors in this movie.  The second was the great acting most of the cast did as when you see them go to the mall and are suddenly trapped inside by the undead with really no other place to go at that time.  You see how they interact and how they try to coexist with each other and the situation they find themselves in.  The movie had a limited budget so don't expect great special effects an the like not that the effects and makeup they used was bad.  The movie is very gory and bloody of course so we pretty much know this is not a family movie to show to the kids but if you're looking for a good horror or zombie movie this one is just for you...</p></body></html>

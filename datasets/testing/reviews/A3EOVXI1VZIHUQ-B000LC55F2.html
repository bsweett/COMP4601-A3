I honestly want to, but I disagree almost entirely with their reviews. This whole movie is a sleight of hand trick, where Christopher Nolan presents you with what you think is a quality film: renowned actors, beautiful cinematography, a supposedly well-crafted script. The problem is that you begin to see the cracks in the presentation fairly quickly.<br /><br />In a story about two rival magicians, Christian Bale tries as hard as ever to pump life into this film, while Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine put forth equal amounts of intensity, but without a solid grounding there's still not much to go with. Scarlett Johansson really drags here with a wavering English accent that annoys more each time it falters. David Bowie really stands out in an unrecognizable turn as Nikola Tesla.<br /><br />The main problem with The Prestige is that it sets itself up for failure. Imagine going to see a great magician perform an infamous trick, and as he flies over the crowd, the strings holding him up become visible. You'd be utterly disappointed, and that's what watching this film is like. Each twist is either entirely predictable or so far-fetched that it belongs in the realm of science fiction.<br /><br />There's just something missing in this film that will ultimately leave audience members feeling like they've been tricked. And I guess that's the point of a good magic show, but with a good magic show, you shouldn't really be able to point out HOW you've been tricked should you?</p></body></html>

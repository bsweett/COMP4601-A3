Even if you take the wolves and their attacks to be mythic, serving as metaphors for the approach of death that we all face - their presence in this film still doesn't work. More compelling, genuine metaphors could have been found for mortality.<br /><br />Although I was somewhat prepared for this film to fail in concept, I thought it might at least give me a chance to see some real wolves close-up, to look into their intense, intelligent eyes. But this movie affords no such opportunity for nature study. Don't think you'll see much of any actual wolves here. In most instances, the film substitutes improbable, Claymation-like mock-ups for real wolves in what few murky close-ups you do get. Godzilla looked like a more realistic, less laughable lizard than these animals look like representatives of their species.<br /><br />Then I thought well, at least I might get a few survival tips from this film. Wrong again. Neeson's character makes the absurd decision to lead the other plane crash survivors away from the relative safety of the plane wreckage - across a vast expanse of snow - into the woods. All right, once having negotiated past this exposure, I thought the men could survive any subsequent wolf attacks by simply climbing a tree. However metaphoric these wolves, they surely couldn't be shown climbing trees in pursuit of their prey. But no one here thinks to climb a tree. Instead, Neeson leads his remaining men on to swing over a chasm. Why?<br /><br />Finally I thought, well, this film might still be salvageable if developed as a revenge-on-humanity tale along the lines of "The Birds." This film starts with that potential when we early see Neeson's character, hired to kill any predators that might threaten the drilling operation in Alaska, shooting a wolf and presiding over its somewhat lingering death. I thought any subsequent wolf attacks might be framed as payback for the callous caging and killing we inflict on other species. But no, the movie doesn't take advantage of that potential springboard into a plotline.<br /><br />There are a few almost touching moments in the last quarter of the film, as the men drop their continuous, pointless cursing at each other and become more sympathetic in their reflections on death. However, these moments aren't nearly enough to rescue any of these antagonists, or this film, from becoming simply a nonsensical, gory mess.</p></body></html>

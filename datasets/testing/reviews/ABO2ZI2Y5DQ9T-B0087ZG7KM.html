<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Funny Comedy But ... Oscar Nominations?"></head><body><p>Meet Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig), whose life is not going well. Her bakery shop on which she spent so much money has failed. Her life is falling apart like her old car. But her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph), who is going to marry, asks Annie to be her bride of honor. Annie is happy to accept, but soon realizes that organizing a wedding requires great patience especially when you have to compete with rich and domineering Helen (Rose Byrne).<br /><br />Whether or not you like "Bridesmaids," one of the biggest hits of 2011, depends on what you expect from the film, which is produced by Judd Apatow. "Bridesmaids" is a "laugh-out-loud" comedy, not a romantic comedy. The film's story is more about the rivalry and friendship between women, which is told with several gross-out jokes involving sex, food poisoning and drinking.<br /><br />In comedy there is a thin line between "laughing with" and "laughing at." While wavering between the two territories, "Bridesmaids" often leans toward the latter with episodes (the bathroom scene) that will make you laugh at the expense of the characters' dignities. While some audiences will find it hilarious, others will think it is embarrassing. OK, "The Help" also has a pie-eating episode, but it is not that crude.<br /><br />"Bridesmaids" is a string of sketches cobbled together. The sketches are mostly funny, but the film loses momentum when it starts to take itself seriously, with a subplot about Annie's romantic interest. I enjoyed watching the film, but does it deserve Oscar nominations? I don't know....</p></body></html>

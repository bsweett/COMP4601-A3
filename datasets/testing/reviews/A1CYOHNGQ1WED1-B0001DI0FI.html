<meta name="summary" content="Amazing battle scenes"></head><body><p>I've never read the books which this movie is based on so I can't say whether they are faithful, but I really enjoyed the movie. Russell Crowe plays Captain Aubrey, a British soldier in command of the HMS Surprise. They are sailing past Brazil looking for a French ship of privateers. The French ship is larger, faster, and has more guns. Her captain manages to sneak up on the British ship twice and Crowe and his crew are lucky to survive to get a third chance at them.<br /><br />The movie is a little too long and there are a couple of times when it gets off track onto things that don't really advance the story. But it does a great job of showing what is was like to serve in the navy in the early nineteenth century. The battle scenes are amazing. I'd love to know how they filmed them because they are so realistic you would swear the actors were having a real sea battle. This was a well written, acted and directed film.</p></body></html>

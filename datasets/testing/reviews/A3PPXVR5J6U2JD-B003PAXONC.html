<meta name="summary" content="What Does it Take to Become a Legend?"></head><body><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765318741">I Am Legend</a>, the novel, spawned the vampires-as-physical-phenomena genre.  Vulnerabilities to religious icons were merely psychological holdovers from victims of a disease who believed they were vampires.  But the thirst for blood was very real. It established the post-apocalyptic fear of contamination.<br /><br />Since I Am Legend is a Will Smith vehicle, I figured it'd have some wisecracks, a lot of action, and Smith saving the day.  So I was surprised to get exactly that - but not delivered in the way I expected.<br /><br />I Am Legend is very much like a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C825J">A Boy & His Dog</a> in that our two protagonists are Robert Neville (Will Smith), a virologist responsible for finding a cure in New York City, and his dog Samantha, wandering a world gone mad. What's interesting about I Am Legend is the question posed by the title.  Why is Neville a legend?<br /><br />The most obvious answer is that Neville is immune to the disease that has converted 90 percent of humanity.  As such, he believes he holds the cure within himself.  In that regard, if Neville can succeed in stopping the plague, he will be a legend to all of humankind.  But there's more to I Am Legend than that.<br /><br />It's fitting that his companion is a dog.  With only Sam as his companion, Neville is truly a legend; the only other living being idolizes Neville, just as dogs idolize their masters.  Neville also creates a fictional community of people out of mannequins in a DVD rental store, where everybody knows his name.  Neville is indeed a legend in his own mind.<br /><br />There's also the possibility, posited in the original story, that Neville isn't famous as a savior, but infamous amongst the new breed of humanity as a mass murderer.  In that regard Neville is legendary not because of whom he saves but whom he kills.  Neville sacrifices countless of the infected in a quest for a cure, and in the process loses a little bit of his own humanity.<br /><br />I Am Legend could easily have been an egotistical macho romp in a world gone mad in the vein of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005R2IS">Mad Max</a>.  Instead, it is a thoughtful meditation on how communities define ourselves, even if your only friend is a dog.  Although the director flinches at the uncompromising ending that could have been (and is on the two-disc special edition), I Am Legend is a serious entry in both science fiction movies and Will Smith's string of blockbusters.</p></body></html>

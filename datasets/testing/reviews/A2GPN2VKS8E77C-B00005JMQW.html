Not only does it move ahead with the story, but the action/romance scenes-of which there are plenty-are well-done. Nice opening credits sequence, which is enough to orient those who haven't seen the first movie. There are also plenty of allusions to the first movie as well. The end is not only satisfying, but leaves a cliffhanger for "Spider-Man III", coming summer 2006. Everyone in this film was convincing in their roles. Shouldn't have been rated PG-13, though there are some frightening images. Keep it up. Better than the first one. Hope the third one exceeds expectations and brings the saga to a close, although making more wouldn't be a bad idea; but you better not push your luck. Rated PG for stylized action-violence.</p></body></html>

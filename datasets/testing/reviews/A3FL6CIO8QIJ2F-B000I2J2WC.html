This is not one of those films that you can pop into the DVD player and watch while your mind is elsewhere; this is a movie that needs to be viewed with articulate attention. I was halfway through the movie before I knew what it was actually about. I have talked to others who have said that reading the book before viewing  the film helps the viewer in understanding the characters and story so I would advised that first. But if you haven't got access to the book here is what I surmised from the viewing of the movie: the main story focuses on the allegation that Jesus Christ actually fatherd a child and had a girl named Sarah. Sarah's  blood line exists to this day much to the chagrin of the Catholic Church. The movie dramitizes certain members who are Roman Catholic determined not to have this knowledge of that bloodline become known. Leonardo Da Vinci's portrait of the last supper has clues and hints of this new knowledge of Christ and that is major plot of the film and alas the "Da Vinci Code" comes from this. The film became one of the biggest blockbusters in motion picture history while at the same time becoming very controversial with conservative Catholics. At nearly two and half hours long the movie makes the viewer think if these allegations of Christ are true. The film is extremely well-acted by Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast and Ron Howard did a virtuoso job as director filming the movie entirely in Europe. The "Da Vinci Code" would spawn the sequel "Angels and Demons" that also became a hit. This 2 disc DVD features bonuses including interviews with Hanks and Howard, behind the scenes clips, and much more. Ebert and Roeper give the film "Two thumbs Up".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Movie Worth Seeing"></head><body><p>September 11, 2001 will live in infamy just as December 7, 1941.  Both days are extremely important in America's history.  This movie does something different.  It's a chance for us to not only remember the day but celebrate the bravery of the passengers on one flight on that tragic day.<br /><br />Definitely a move worth seeing.  Beautiful, passionate, and well directed.  This day will live with all of us for the rest of our lives.  A movie like this helps us to remember that some people on that day showed their bravery and hopefully it will inspire us.<br /><br />I recommend that everybody should see this.  You'll definitely look at life differently.</p></body></html>

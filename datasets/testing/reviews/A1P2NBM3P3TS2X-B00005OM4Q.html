This movie is wonderful but in a subtle way, and Oscar prefers less subtlety.  &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is a superb coming-of-age account of Cameron Crowe's early (VERY early) days as a rock journalist.  William Miller, Crowe's alter-ego, is played by newcomer Patrick Fugit, and he is a real charmer!  While this movie takes a little longer to get started than, say, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, it is like having a backstage pass to the glory days of the rock business, &quot;before corporations killed it&quot;, as Lester Bangs supposedly said.  Kate Hudson shines as band-aid Penny Lane, but is it really an Oscar-worthy performance?  We'll find out around the time this review gets posted.  Watch for Peter Frampton in a small role.  This movie will bring back pleasant memories of rock and roll in its pre-corporate heydey, back when the fans decided what was good, rather than having MTV &quot;tell&quot; them.</p></body></html>

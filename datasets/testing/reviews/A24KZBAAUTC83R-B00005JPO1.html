<meta name="summary" content="Typical Cheesey Indiana Jones Film"></head><body><p>My wife hated it. I expected pretty much what I got. A far-fetched, cheesey Indiana Jones film, chock-full of car chases, over-the-top bad guys, unbelievable sequences that can make your eyes roll with the extreme cheesiness of it, but a decent film for what it is.<br /><br />I would have liked to see this franchise grow-up a bit more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="King Fred"></head><body><p>Whatever this movie is about (and I'm not quite sure, it is very confusing), it is not about King Arthur. If you have even the remotest notion of what the Arthurian legends are about, please dismiss them before watching this movie, because you will otherwise spend the entire time saying things like "No WAY!" and "Wha?" and other rude things.<p>Let's get to the point: There is no Excalibur, no Morgan Le Fey, no Camelot. Arthur, who is broodingly played by Clive Owen, eminently forgettable in the role, has no visible means of income, but has a Round Table that could be the pride of any hip New York decorator. The Knights reminded me of nothing so much as Robin Hood's Merry Men, from their looks to their ribald jousting--I kept forgetting what movie I was watching.<p>And then there is Guinevere. I adore Keira Knightley, and she did look so pretty, and so very fierce--but excuse me: She fights in battle beside her man (a nod to modern-day political correctness, one assumes), even when no other woman fights. While her comrades in arms dress appropriately for battle in animal skins and armor and heavy protective garb, she fights in two strategically placed straps over her (ahem) chest. And while nobody else is painted blue, she has taken the time in the forest before this pivotal battle to paint blue and interesting symbols all over herself (drawing attention to key assets).<p>The leader of the Saxons looks exactly like Willie Nelson, complete with gray braided hair, and his son, who inexplicably has a brush cut (but did braid his beard), looks like Beckham.<p>OK, go see if it you must. The battle scenes, especially the one on the cracking ice, are great. The acting is strangely uninspired, to match the brooding monochromatic camerawork. Keira does her energetic and enthusiastic best as a warrior, and she is too likeable to diss, even in a movie this bad.</p></body></html>

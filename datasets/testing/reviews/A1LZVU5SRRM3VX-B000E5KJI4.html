<meta name="summary" content="An epic to watch without thinking too much"></head><body><p>If you go to other reviews in this forum, you will find some very thoughtful, thorough reviews from people comparing this film to its source material, Homer's Iliad.  Such comparisons, while interesting and worthwhile, are really pointless, since Hollywood is notorious for taking perfectly good source material and inexplicably changing pieces of it for the purposes of condensing the story, expediting exposition, or simply focusing on a different aspect of the story than has traditionally been told.  Thus, it was probably good that my memory of reading the Iliad in high school was somewhat fuzzy--it was much better for me to consider the film on its own merits, even if it did depart from Homer's storyline in a few significant respects.<br /><br />Troy might well have been titled Achilles, for Brad Pitt's character is really the centerpiece of the film.  Pitt brings an earnest, amoral righteousness to Achilles that makes the viewer realize that there is more to Pitt than a pretty face, flowing locks, good muscle tone, and an all-over tan.  Although the screenwriting pushes Achilles' struggles with Agamemmnon and his own conscience to the forefront for much of the film, the rest of the ensemble cast is similarly well-chosen.  Brian Cox is sufficiently egomaniacal as Agamemmnon, Eric Bana (who has totally underwhelmed me with previous performances) actually shows a bit of range in this film as Hector, Sean Bean makes a believable Odysseus, and Peter O'Toole is stately as Priam.  Probably the best commentary on the acting in the film is that each main character comes off as both heroic and yet fatally flawed.  Strangely enough, the face that launched a thousand ships and whose infidelity actually precipitated the Trojan War, plays a relatively minor role in the film, although Kruger (the actress playing Helen) is appropriately beautiful and conflicted in her minor role.<br /><br />The major improvement over Homer is that, apart from a few statues, temples, and offhanded references, the Greek gods are basically nonexistent in the film, giving the characters a grounding in reality instead of the supernatural.  For the purposes of this film, that is a good thing, as bringing the involvement of the gods into the affairs of men would cloud an already complicated storyline of shaky and sometimes shifting allegiances.<br /><br />The battle sequences are generally magnificently done, particularly where Achilles is involved, and although much blood is spilled, few scenes seem gratuitous or pointless.  There is purpose in these battles--the Greeks are empire building and the Trojans are protecting their homeland.  And when Achilles joins the fray, look out.  His battle sequences are sufficiently entertaining to keep the viewer fully engaged and mesmerized, yet are understated enough to leave the viewer wanting more.<br /><br />The film's pacing is also better than most movies that exceed two hours--I rarely found myself clock watching.  Petersen's directing is also generally good, although even a relatively untrained eye like mine noted some awkward cuts and angles.<br /><br />After watching some recent disappointments passing themselves off as epics (see my review of King Arthur, for example), Troy was a breath of fresh air.  Homer it's not, but I didn't rent it expecting a strict interpretation.  The film does what it sets out to do, and does so in an entertaining manner, and that's all I was hoping for.  Watch the film and enjoy the performances, just don't confuse it with the Iliad.</p></body></html>

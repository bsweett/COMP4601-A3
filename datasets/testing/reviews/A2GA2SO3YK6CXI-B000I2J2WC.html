We read the book first, then acquired a previous work by the same author, Angels & Demons, which is also a masterpiece. The controversy created by these books provide an ever-ending topic of conversation. While reading the book, I could not believe that I had missed seeing the "clues" mentioned by the author on the works of Da Vinci, especially with regards to his famous "The Last Supper." So we went to the library, obtained an arts book and with a magnifying glass, observed that all details as mentioned by the book were there, and yet, they had gone unnoticed when we had studied the work. If you allow yourself to research as you go along reading, The Da Vinci Code is simply... fascinating. When the movie came out, a group of friends went to see it at the theatre, and we then had dinner to discuss the performance. We agree that the movie is fabulous. The plot is followed to provide entertainment without measure, but, we agreed that for those who had not read the book, the movie could be rather confusing. The script follows Dan Brown's book to the point, incorporating changes that were surprising and welcomed, for the ending is easier to understand. The performance by Tom Hanks, who plays the Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon is excellent. The images played on the screen behind him immediately allows us to realize the power of symbols and how deceptive they may be if we do not know the origin and meaning intended when they were created. Audrey Tautou plays Sophie Neveu and does an outstanding job, very believable. The movie is filmed on location and it is simply superb to be able to see the book we loved to read... come to life! Neveu and Langdon join forces to solve many mysteries and they capture our attention and imagination from the start. Sir Ian McKellen provides an excellent performance as Sir Leigh Teabing, making this movie an unforgettable experience. To enjoy the movie to its fullest, we highly recommend reading The Da Vinci Code... as well as Angels & Demons... and then... sitting to enjoy a movie... and a story line... that has traveled world-wide.</p></body></html>

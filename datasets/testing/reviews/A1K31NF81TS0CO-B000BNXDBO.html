Get your heads out of your Patookus's and take some notes!  You might learn something!!!<br /><br />This movie stars two very funny men, of middle and Eastern Asian Descent, and provides a look at our two main men, as they head out on their pursuit to score some White Castle burgers!  Mmmm, mmmm.  Can't you just taste them?<br /><br />They meet lots of colorful characters, and you know this is just a 90 minute excuse to watch them chase after pot all over New Jersey.<br /><br />I loved this movie, and laughed hard at the gross and super funny humor.<br /><br />I would recommend it.<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!</p></body></html>

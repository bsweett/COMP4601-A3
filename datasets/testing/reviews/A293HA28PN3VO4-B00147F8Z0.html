<meta name="summary" content="Redemption from AVP, too many characters"></head><body><p>After AVP, I felt this franchise was dead. As a huge fan of the original Alien, Aliens and Predator, the AVP film was silly and inconsequential to me. Many of the scenes involving fights and the dialogue of the humans was almost comical (one of my "favorites" is when the human and predator "team up" and are running in sync with hair and braids flying in sync)-looks like I was in a romantic comedy. The first AVP was also very dark and slow moving.<br /><br />While AVP 2 Requiem does not come close to the quality of fright and "wow" reactions I experienced for the original franchise films, the second part, had a faster pace and some interesting "species" specific on screen behavior (such as the "insemination" of the human mothers). The scenes still remained overly dark, but the PQ and AQ were more than adequate. The sound was powerful and detail crisp.<br /><br />I was happy to see the return of a strong female lead character, although at times, there were simply too many characters to become invested in the survival. The end was a bit abrupt, but the last scene with "Mrs. Yutani" provided a twist that tied the first Alien movies to a possible sequel.<br /><br />In addition, I wish there had been a prolonged battle scene between the two species. They seemed more like "scuffles".<br /><br />For its effects and redemption, this film is worth a rent if you're a fan of the other films. Lets hope the next film continues a positive evolution of the franchise and introduces a more focused plot and developed characters.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An exercise in how not to reinterpret classic fairytales."></head><body><p>The Bothers Grimm is grim indeed, visually sumptuous, with some startling visual set pieces, but it's a movie without a shape and it ultimately lacks a decent plot. It doesn't help that the juvenile screenplay has the lead actors running around making it all up as they go along, with the director looking as though he has given them free reign to spend almost two hours shouting at one another and embarrassingly bumbling through all the fantastical proceedings.<br /><br />Director, Terry Gilliam is indeed a maverick director and his visionary reputation often precedes him, which makes his latest exercise in cinematic fantasy so enormously disappointing. The Brothers Grimm tries so hard to be whimsical and magical, but for some reason, the movie ends up coming across as rather flat, leaden, and joyless, an effects laden travesty with some of the images so over-produced and cluttered that most viewers will probably end up with a bad case of claustrophobia.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm is a film that has little to do with the actual folklore heroes (they'd probably be turning in their grave). As played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger these German brother storytellers are now con men, a couple of wondering minstrels who specialize in the eradication of paranormal phenomena, such as witches. In the early 19th century, the couple trolls French-controlled Germanic towns preying on the superstitions of their inhabitants.<br /><br />Kitted out in period attire and unconvincing British accents, the story tracks the brothers as, at the request of a French general Jonathan Pryce, they try to solve a series of small-town kidnappings. Someone is stealing all the little girls - including red riding hood - with the trail leading to a giant tower in an enchanted forest, where an evil Queen (Monica Bellucci) is trying to recapture her youth, after her beauty has been ravaged by a terrible plague.<br /><br />The Bothers Grimm splutters and jolts along with some moments of visual flair, but the proceedings are just too contrived and all too predictable. Ledger and Damon are decent enough actors, but under Gilliam's direction their characters ultimately come off as blank slates, serving as handsome vehicles, or mere background to the next piece of CGI wizardry.<br /><br />When directors set about re-interpreting classical fairy stories, they need to be sure that they can fully honor the source material. One gets the distinct impression that Gilliam just doesn't fully seem to understand the primal attraction of these classic tales. Instead, mystery and fear has been replaced by corny, bumbling around, the characters made into cartoonish caricatures, more concerned with doing stupid sight gags than forwarding the flimsy plot.<br /><br />Of course, there are the usual lavishly trumped up sets, the detailed costumes and props, a darkly ironic if unsteady tone and hiccups of strained surrealism. But The Brothers Grimm mostly falls terribly flat - there's no sense of danger, excitement or mystery; and with all its efforts to towards visual flare, the Brothers Grim, comes across as just another one of those over produced summer studio films; a film that ultimately leaves the viewer feeling as though it was all just a big waste of time.

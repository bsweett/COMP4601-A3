<meta name="summary" content="A BD review"></head><body><p>I was unsure how an unknown Swedish group could do with a BD transfer, and I will admit - I was impressed with everything (almost). From the menu sounds/pic to the amount of audio/sub selections to the DTS. Unfortunately, the extras were mediocre, but the quality of the transfer makes for the only 5-star I have given with a semi-bare BD.<br /><br />The picture was superb throughout, but only if your white balance and related settings are done correctly. The amount of snowscapes and fair skin mingled with blood and darkness makes for a competent test of the display. I had this one playing on a Panasonic 58 and there was a temperant difference in between settings (over-saturation, line blur, etc.).<br /><br />The sound was exquisite. I listened to both the English DTS and the Swedish DTS, and the difference was notable. Mistakenly I had both English subs on with the dub - that was a mess. They should try to hire the same company to do both, it seemed like two different movies so I would recommend to skip the dub version. The outer channels were used extensively, and if anything, turn up the menu (wind, snow, water) to hear some wonderfully subtle decibels. Refresh rate test: the scene where the lights get turned off in the gym.<br /><br />The extras are light, with a seven minute behind the scenes and a pic gallery of our unknown cast. Definitely an owner for the fans of this film, and even with as subtle as the majority of this film is, the channels and display get a fair workout.</p></body></html>

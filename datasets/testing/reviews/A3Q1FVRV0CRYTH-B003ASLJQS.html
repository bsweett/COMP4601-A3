I wanted to say that first because it's such a hollywood tradition to drastically change a novel when creating a film adaptation that they rape it of everything that made it special in the beginning.  I'm glad to hear that Eastwood did not do that to Dennis Lehane's masterpiece (or so I hear that it is a wonderfull novel)  That said, I was surprised at how well this movie was done.  I mean, when a film is that glorified it better be perfect, and I really was expecting to be let down, but to my shock I was not, not at all.  The acting I must admitt was amazing, especially on the part of Tim Robbins who plays Dave Boyle, the grown man still trapped in the mind of the child he once was.  The story revolves around three friends years after one of them was molested.  That one was Dave.  Now they are all grown and have moved on.  Jimmy Markham (Penn) is a one time crook (or is it one time) who is now married and has a beautiful daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum from Phantom of the Opera).  Dave is also married to Marcia Gay Harden's charactor and Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) is now a police detective.  All three of these men have rarly kept in touch (especially Kevin Bacon's charactor) but are all forced to interact after Jimmy's daughter is brutally murdered, Dave becomes the prime suspect and Sean has to investigate.  The story itself is gripping and the whole charactor study was wonderfully exicuted.  Both Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden did wonderful jobs as supporting and yet greiving wives, one as she deals with the loss of a daughter and the other while she struggles with the idea that her husband is a killer.  I was in tears by the end of the film (for more than one reason) for this is one of the most moving films I've ever seen.  I will say this.  Sean Penn was great, but I felt his performance in 21 Grams was better.  Tim Robbins is the reason this film works so well...just watching his charactor move you can see all that he is and you know that Tim became Dave Boyle...and that is a good thing, a very good thing...How Lord of the Rings beat this as best film of the year I'll never understand...</p></body></html>

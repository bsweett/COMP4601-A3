<meta name="summary" content="Alien 3"></head><body><p>Pre-Fight Club David Fincher directed this misunderstood entry into the Alien franchise. While it's a flawed film, it does touch on some themes that weren't done in the first two, and there are some effectively creepy moments.<p>The special effects quota reverts back to the original's modus operandi of not showing the aliens as much as James Cameron's &quot;everything and the kitchen sink&quot; trademark. Which is rather effective and creepy, utilising the old &quot;hiding in the shadows&quot; trick. And Sigourney Weaver is good as the tough-as- nails Ellen Ripley. Still, it's disappointing compared to the first two films, because the action is subdued, the characters are cardboard and the plot is very silly. But there is some good action, and while the nihilistic ending would have seemed to rule out the possibility of a fourth entry, Alien Resurrection carried on the story to bigger, and arguably better effect.</p></body></html>

And the documentary outlining the reconstruction of GBU is super, what a treat to see old Eastwood and even older Wallach mouthing their young dialogue into their young mouths in the cushy recording studio, a far cry from the plains of New Mexico.  It makes you long for more, for there is probably another ten minutes of the complete version to be found, restored, and interpolated with the new extended version so splendidly presented here.<br /><br />The movie itself is one of the masterpieces both of Italian and US cinema, and how many films get to boast of that?  When I was a boy, the Morricone whistling theme became a top pop single, a feat that very few Westerns of recent vintage can aspire to.  It's a haunting melody and watched with Leone's trademark close-ups and then sudden cutaways to long grand vistas, it gives you the chills of sudden fear from your spine to all your extremities.</p></body></html>

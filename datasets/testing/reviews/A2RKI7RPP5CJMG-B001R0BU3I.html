The film opens with Horn as a child in Sudan learning his Muslim faith from his father.  Then we see Horn witness his father's death via a car bomb.<br /><br />Hurtle forward into modern times and we find Samir trying to cut a deal with Muslim terrorists.  He is captured in a raid in Yemen and soon finds himself offered assistance by the FBI in return for crucial information on terrorist cells all over the world.  When he refuses to help, he is left to rot in a Yemeni prison where he forms a close bond with a fellow Muslim named Omar (Said Taghmaoui).<br /><br />The pair, along with a number of Omar's cohorts, escape the prison and meet up with the Islamic Brotherhood.  From there, the film goes across the globe, allowing the viewer to witness a number of terrorists acts that are headed up by Samir's knowledge of weapons and of the Qu'ran.<br /><br />Meanwhile, FBI Agent Clayton (Pearce) and his team are trying to find out who is pulling off all of the terrorists bombings.  Soon enough Clayton pegs Samir as a prime suspect and the chase is one.<br /><br />The viewer is forced to question the motives of Samir from the very beginning.  Is he truly a terrorist?  Perhaps he is just a loyal fanatical Muslim who believes that glory awaits those who strike down the infidel?  Maybe he's doing this all to bring down the real bad guys?  You'll have to watch the film to find out, since saying too much more will spoil the film.<br /><br />Cheadle does an excellent job as the mysterious Samir Horn.  Guy Pearce is wonderful as the minister's son-turned-lawman, Clayton.  Said Taghmaoui is brilliant as the highly intelligent and near-fanatical Muslim believer, Omar.  The supporting cast, which features Jeff Daniels, the always reliable and completely underrated Neal McDonough, Alyy Khan, Archie Panjabi and Hassam Ghancy, give solid performances as well.<br /><br />What I personally found enjoyable about this film is that Islam is dicussed by fanatics, loyalists and outsiders who both fear and respect the faith.  Samir's interactions with Omar and Clayton on Islam are brilliant, and show the viewer that there's a whole lot more to Islam than blowing up the infidel and declaring Jihad on everyone.<br /><br />While the film does run a bit slow at times it is, overall, a tight suspense drama with just enough action to keep it interesting.  It is an intelligent film and I highly recommend it to people interested in the subjects of espionage, terrorism and religion.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ADD TO THAT LIST OF GREAT WESTERNS"></head><body><p>In the same league as Red River or High Noon, Open Range ranks along with the list of all time great westerns. <p>Duvall gives an exceptional performance as a weathered cowboy and good 'ol boy who is put to the test by unscrupulous ranchers bent on crushing him, his partner (Costner) and his herd of cattle. Annette Bening gives a credible performance as nurse/assistant to her brother, the town's only Doctor whose practice has become brisk since our two heroes have arrived.<p>But the movie belongs to Costner who, above all, pulls in a notably controlled performance -- a good earthy presence in the style we have become accustomed to by now. His direction is quietly superb, the visuals stunning, and the score haunting. Gunfights are refreshingly convincing and well staged. I am pretty sure there'll be academy nominations for Duvall's supporting cast, and for Costner's direction.<p>Recommended weekend fare!</p></body></html>

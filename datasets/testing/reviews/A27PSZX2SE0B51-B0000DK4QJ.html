<meta name="summary" content="Oedipus Directs: Spielberg's "Report" is an Eye-Popping Film"></head><body><p>Besides the obvious, Philip K. Dick's short story, "Minority Report" draws on at least two other literary influences.  The precogs, a trio of psychics blessed (cursed?) with the ability to see murders before they happen, are named Arthur, Dashiell, and Agatha.  Fans of Sherlock Holmes, Sam Spade, or Hercule Poirot will thus be 'clued' in that this is a detective story of another colour.  Less obviously, but much more relevant, the story neatly parallels the Sophoclean tale of Oedipus Rex.  You remember him, don't you?  He tried to avoid a future prophesized by an oracle, in which he would kill his father and marry his mother.  But fates have a funny way of coming true; not only did the prophecy hold, but he lost his eyes in the process.  I wonder if any of this sounds familiar to John Anderton?<p>At times, the film feels like something Paul Verhoeven ("Total Recall", another Dick story, but also "RoboCop") or Ridley Scott ("Blade Runner", the uber-Dick screen adaptation, but also "Alien") would have churned out.  But when the omnipresent John Williams score kicks in, and the near-hokey scenes of a precious little boy rear their heads, you know you've entered Steven Spielberg country.<p>"Minority Report" is only Spielberg's second movie to combine intellectually adult ideas with a popcorn-thriller sensibility.  "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", the other such entry in his oeuvre, had a much greater sense of innocence and wonder, but not nearly as much bravura filmmaking.  Spielberg's camera seems to be doing cartwheels at times.  It became very disorienting in the action-heavy sequences (not helped by the harsh lighting that dominates the frame), but the effect worked in that it kept the audience on their toes and paying attention during the more measured scenes.<p>Besides story, Spielberg's other strength is in creating cutting-edge visuals.  On this note, he does not disappoint.  A fascinating vision of a credible future is laid at the audience's feet.  Although learned sci-fi fans will have seen many of its characteristics in other futuristic dystopias (the hyper-predomination of advertising was in "Blade Runner"; retinal scans were used in... uh... "Barb Wire"), this one is different in that it has the full power of the Spielberg machine behind it.  He apparently consulted successful futurists to come up with a vision for 2054.  What they've succeeded in providing is a world of urban decay, but also gargantuan and clean office buildings; oppressive mass transit systems, but also quaint backcountry roads; high-tech apartments, and homogenous urban sprawl.  In short, a diverse world.  Spielberg achieves a unified vision through a wide variety of styles that is quite impressive.<p>He also does a fine job of keeping the audience on their toes with multiple moments of squirmy terror, followed by some fine, understated comic relief.  The former is exemplified by one scene that makes you think it's about to quote "Un Chien Andalou", and the latter is exemplified in an "Evil Dead"-esque moment where Anderton chases his own eyeballs down a hall.  A scene where retinal scanning spiders search an apartment building will have those with arachnophobia clutching their armrests, while laughing at the quirky personalities the spiders take on.  This is Spielberg at his most playful; he has the audience right where he wants them, and he pulls and pushes them with all the skill of a master puppeteer.<br /><br />The film's one flaw, from a directorial standpoint, is something that also marred Spielberg's last effort, "A.I.".  Like that more bloated failure, Spielberg teases the audience with multiple endings.  The difference being that what felt tacked on and manipulative in his last movie (a Hail Mary attempt to achieve a happy ending) becomes almost necessary here.  The 'first' ending, if he had left it as such, would have been perfectly serviceable to the story he was trying to tell.  Because he went further -- through the looking glass, past the closet, to the other side of the curtain -- the story opens itself up to ask (and answer) many other relevant questions.  Unfortunately, the flow of the movie was constantly being disrupted, as ending became twist became ending became twist, ad nausea.  These "fourth" act problems caused the movie to be a tad overlong.  Also, there were many opportunities to trim the film that Spielberg didn't take advantage of, prior to the denouements.  He indulges in too many scenes of talky exposition that slow the action down to a near standstill.  A less powerful man behind the camera might have been forced to bring the movie in under 2 hours.  Spielberg didn't have that luxury.<p>He did have the luxury of casting a likable and bankable star in the lead role.  Cruise learned many a lesson from the jumble that was "Vanilla Sky" (he even gets to ugly himself up again).  John Anderton appears to be a typical Tom Cruise character: a loving dad, determined in action, heroic in battle.  But he's also a terribly flawed character, destroyed by tragedy.  And if you really sit back and take in the plot, you realize that Anderton is little more than a cipher, a pawn used to move the plot along to its inevitable conclusion.<p>The rest of the cast, none with very meaty roles, are all exceptional in supporting Cruise.  Samantha Morton as the dominant precog, the aforementioned Von Sydow and Farrell, and Lois Smith as an enigmatic scientist, all do fine work.<p>While not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, "Minority Report" will please those looking for an intelligent film fix in an otherwise bland summer, those looking for a Spielberg fix in the wake of the unfulfilling "A.I.", and those looking for a Cruise action fix in between "Mission Impossibles".  And it'll probably please the rest of you too.</p></body></html>

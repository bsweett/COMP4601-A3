<meta name="summary" content="Questionable casting choices in an otherwise great-looking film"></head><body><p>You know, it's obvious that Troy is not entirely faithful to Homer's The Iliad. But that's not what's bad about the movie (I mean, come on. It's a fact that not every movie is true to the books they're based on). No, the biggest flaws in the movie are the casting choices. The supporting cast is really good, and Peter O'Toole is typically brilliant. However, the five major leads of the film (Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Rose Byrne, and Diane Kruger) are badly miscast. None of them fit their parts (even Pitt): they look unconvincing and undistinguished. And Brad Pitt is a pretty cool guy, but seriously, how can ANYONE picture him as Achilles? Good news, however. The look of the film is a treat. The sets look marvelous, the battle scenes are well-staged, and the CGI effects actually look realistic.<br /><br />I'm kind of mixed about this film. I dislike the main performances and the music. But at the same time, I like everything else in the film. I'll give this a C+, because I don't exactly dislike the entire film. I just wish they chose some better actors for the main characters.<br /><br />Grade: C+</p></body></html>

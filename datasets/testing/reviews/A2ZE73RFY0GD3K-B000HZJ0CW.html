<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Rikers Is Really Ticked Off Now"></head><body><p>Remember the Star Trek - Next Generation episode in which the crew discovered, trapped on a remote installation, a &quot;double&quot; of Will Riker?  And this individual actually WAS Will Riker, who eight years previous had been on a mission there, and unknowingly had encountered some sort of ray that split him into two individuals, both the exact same person.  One Riker returned to the Enterprise and continued his career, and the other stayed trapped at the installation.<p>Eight years later, the Enterprise crew discovered him.  Effectively on vacation for eight years, he had not really grown any.  His career was in suspense -- while the other Riker had continued upward, and was now first mate of the Enterprise.  The relationship between Riker #1 and Deanna had cooled, but Riker #2 still cared for her, and proposed to her... but she refused, since her feelings for Will (either of them) had changed in eight years.  Riker #2 departed, and took up his middle name (Thomas) to distinguish himself from Riker #1 (Will).<p>Now, in this final Star Trek movie, Will Riker marries Deanna.  Don't you have to know that Riker #2 Thomas, still out there in the Federation somewhere, had to be majorly hacked off when he heard about that?  Riker #2 was the one whose feelings for Deanna had NOT changed, yet old Riker #1 ended up getting the girl.<p>If there was strife between the two Rikers at family reunions before, one can only imagine (with horror) what things are like now.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent but a little too much gore"></head><body><p>4.2 stars<br /><br />There are many things to love about this movie, especially the genre-bending. I liked how we gain sympathy for the aliens, and how well District 9 was shot. The technology is quite convincing, the characters interesting--especially the well-played lead--and overall I thought this was almost a truly classic film.<br /><br />But, I just couldn't get by the (to me) excessive gore and violence in the early going. It jarred me too much and while it did create some sympathy and antipathy as planned, it also turned me off somewhat. This became clearest towards the middle of the film when we start to really get in the aliens' heads and feel for them, at which point I realized how numb the early gore had made me.<br /><br />Other than that, I thought this was a very intelligent, engrossing movie that transcended its genre nicely at various points. Jackson's involvement clearly brings world-class visual effects and feel, and that's a major plus. The blu-ray version is fine looking, quite realistic indeed. Take away some of the blood and guts and this might be almost Star Wars-quality, and a great movie for kids as well as sci-fi fans. As it stands, it's still excellent, but with caveats.</p></body></html>

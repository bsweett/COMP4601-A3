<meta name="summary" content="Tragic, depressing, and brilliant"></head><body><p>Wow! I finally got around to seeing this movie, and it was not at all what I expected. I can't believe how raw and gritty this film is...it's not the kind of movie you expect to see Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman in (or Natalie Portman's naked ass, for that matter). "Closer" is the story of four desperate and selfish people who commit various acts of adultery and betrayal. Dan, an obituary writer and struggling novelist (Jude Law) meets and falls in love with photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) while he is involved in a relationship with the free-spirited Alice (Natalie Portman). Dan inadvertently introduces Anna to Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist she ends up marrying even though she is carrying on an affair with Dan on the side.<br /><br />"Closer" is a very dark and depressing movie that basically takes every nightmarish relationship story you've ever heard and combines it into one tragic tale. It's a very intense movie that puts sex right at the forefront of conversation, sparing no details. (If you're the kind of person who is unfamiliar with graphic talk about sex, DO NOT see this movie!) Despite its brutal subject matter, this film is exceptionally well done. The four principle actors deliver spectacular performances. (The scene where Anna reveals her secret to Larry is unbelievable...Roberts and Owen are spectacular. Owen and Law also have a great scene set in Larry's office that is heartbreaking and yet almost comical at times. And every scene with Portman is amazing...this is definitely her best role to date.)<br /><br />This is a very emotional, tragic, beautiful film. It's not the kind of movie you'll want to watch again and again because it's so incredibly depressing, but it's a very unique and brilliant film...definitely worth seeing.</p></body></html>

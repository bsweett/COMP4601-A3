He was also ruthless and pushed his men to the extreme but he was up there with them. One of the best generals of the last few centuries by any reconing.  This film could have been a disaster but instead it was a masterpiece. From it's starting speech to it's final moments as the great warrior waits for more battles. This movie is even more remarkable in that it came out in 1970 when the military was hated by hollywood and they did smear jobs about it. Not that it's perfect mind you or that war is really glorious in reality. But that's how patton saw it and it's a good thing he did too. This movie looks great on blu ray and the print is free of dirt, the natural film grain is there but that's ok. Patton is a war hero and this film which one an oscar for the great late george c scott. (and it made him a movie star instead of just a character actor) is worth every penny . Unlike many other titles out there from this era they cleaned this one up for blu ray and it's worth upgrading to.  It's not going to be as sharp as movies made in the last 15 years but the blu ray looks great really. unlike the sad releases that I have seen such as 'rio lobo' or 'the horse soldiers' movies that have dirt all over the prints, even 'little big man' is a bad print on blu ray. THis one is NOT a bad print and a plus for your collection.</p></body></html>

I've always been a fan of his, and with the help of director Jon Favreau (a fine actor in his own right) the two create a silly, never boring film of complete entertainment. It would be silly to try to say anything that hasn't already been said, but I rented the single-disc version; I'd been buying too many films, sight-unseen. This is one I'd buy, and that's about the best recommendation I could give!  Haven't heard much about Ms. Paltrow lately, but she's quite fine and confident in an important role. Jeff Bridges, too, always Mr. Nice guy in every film he's made, but here he shows surprising variation. As I said, everything's been blabbed away by previous reviewers, but I was amused and entertained a whole lot. There WILL be subsequent episodes, and I look forward to them. I just hope it doesn't dissolve in Hollywood garbage like other super-hero franchises...</p></body></html>

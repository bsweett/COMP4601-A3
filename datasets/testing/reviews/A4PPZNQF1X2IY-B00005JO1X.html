It's slow, predictable, poorly written, with inauthentic characters.  The children interact like robots and transmit no real excitement, curiousity, or surprise.  The story about the lost king and evil snow queen seems terribly simplistic and well-trodden.  This screenplay has to be a disservice to Lewis' work.  Stone cold dull.</p></body></html>

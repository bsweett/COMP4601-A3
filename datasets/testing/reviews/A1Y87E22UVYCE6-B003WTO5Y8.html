He fleshes Dr. Lecter with such sinister accuracy that his memory still haunts me.<br /><br />IMHO this is the best film directed by Jonathan Demme, closely followed by "Philadelphia" (1993), light year away in quality from more recent "The Manchurian Candidate".<br /><br />This film is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen! I will recommend it only for adult audiences due to very violent scenes.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

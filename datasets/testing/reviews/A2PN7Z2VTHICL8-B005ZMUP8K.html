<meta name="summary" content="Tis a pirate's life for me ..."></head><body><p>This second in the 'Pirates' series starts out with the arrest of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) for previously aiding Captain Jack Sparrow (the fantastic Johnny Depp).  Will is released on the condition that he brings back Sparrow's compass.<br /><br />But the search isn't really for the compass, its for the key and the contents of the infamous 'Dead Man's Chest', which supposedly contains the still beating heart of legendary Captain Davy Jones, captain of The Flying Dutchman with its crew of dead, and rather intriguing, men.<br /><br />The Flying Dutchman's crew has long since molded themselves to the sea, one being a hammerhead shark, another being a hermit crab, and yet another molded into the boat itself.  Captain Davy Jones is a squid with crab claws, and the FX on these costumes is among the best.<br /><br />The race is on to find the key, and the chest, between three men who each want the heart for their own selfish purposes.  Will, Sparrow, and the disgraced Norrington.  Not to mention Captain Jones.  Will is in for a surprise when he's bargained to Jones by Sparrow, finding his father among the disfigured dead, trapped on Jones' crew for eternity.<br /><br />For a Disney film, 'Dead Man's Chest' is a little rough for the kiddies.  I certainly wouldn't want my little ones watching a crow peck out a man's eyeball or seeing some of the nightmarish creations of Jones' crew.  But as an adult, it's extremely entertaining.  The escape from the island is particularly hilarious.<br /><br />My only complaint with the movie is that a) it's a bit long and b) it's only a chapter.  The ending holds no resolution and is an obvious continuation to part three when it comes out.  Too many important plot factors are left up in the air.  Overall, its just as entertaining as 'Black Pearl' but with far better FX and a bit more jaunty action.  I consider this movie worthy of a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

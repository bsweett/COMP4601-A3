<meta name="summary" content="It tries soooooo hard to be better than it actually is."></head><body><p>LAC really thinks it is a better and more clever movie than it actually is.  In truth, it tries to emulate "Silence of the Lambs" and "Seven" and a few other films by being a mash-up of those films.  The result is less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The direction is by-the-numbers and uninspired.  The script is cliche-ridden and needs a few draft revisions to make it a little fresher.<br /><br />MAJOR leaps in logic, geography, and timing.  (So-and-so character is heading back to a certain location, but the person who left long after he did from the same location manages to beat him there too easily..., etc).<br /><br />This film was shot during a very cold Philadelphia winter, and in one dialogue scene shot on an interior staircase in a courthouse, there is visible steam coming from the actors' mouths.  Looks as if the movie crew was granted access to the building during off-hours or a weekend but didn't agree to pay to have the heat turned on.<br /><br />There were a few twists to the genre in this film, but I found out later they were (probably) borrowed from a certain Japanese thriller from a few years ago.  Is there NOTHING original anymore?<br /><br />One thing in particular that made me chuckle:  Fairly early on in the film I was having trouble understanding some of Jamie Foxx's spoken dialog because he tends to swallow his words.  So I watched the rest of the film with the subtitles on.  During a scene where Gerard Butler's character is playing music from his iPod, the subtitle reads "[Jazz playing]".  The music was not Jazz --  it was the song "Eminence Front" by The Who.  But as if that weren't funny enough, a few moments later, after the film has cut away to another location and then returned to the iPod playing, the subtitles then read "[Funk playing]", but it is still the SAME SONG playing!  I didn't know (and I bet The Who's Pete Townshend didn't either) that the first half of the rock song "Eminence Front" is Jazz and the second half is Funk.  Boy, have my music genre identification skills been wrong for a lot of years!!<br /><br />Rent but don't buy.</p></body></html>

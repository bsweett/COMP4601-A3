<meta name="summary" content="One of the great ones!"></head><body><p>"Vertigo" is now acknowledged to be one of the great ones, although this was not popular opinion at the time.  No matter.  James Stewart and Kim Novak are both brilliant in this moody, twisty, and ultimately gripping thriller.  I will refrain from commenting much about the plot except to say that this film is unusually vulnerable to spoilers, and I do not want to spoil this fine film for anyone who, like me, comes to it later in life.<br /><br />James Stewart is a retired police detective who is asked to follow his friend's wife who is, to say the least, acting strangely.  The chemistry takes off, and more would be telling, except to say that very few viewers will see where this one is going.  Kim Novak's performance goes well beyond her sometimes "sex kitten" roles, showing the depth and versatility of this fine actress.  To add surprise, the film also features the young Barbara Bel Geddes in a supporting role as Stewart's old (now extinguished) flame.<br /><br />The San Francisco and Northern California locales, shot on actual location (mostly not sets), are wonderful.  This is one of those films where the setting combined with the musical score sets up the film for an almost unbearable nostalgia.  If you watch the DVD, try to find a large TV screen upon which to enjoy this wonderful film.<br /><br />A must for all movie lovers.  RJB.</p></body></html>

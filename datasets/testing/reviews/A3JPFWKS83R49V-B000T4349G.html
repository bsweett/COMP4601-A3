The main character goes to great lengths to preserve/discover the memory of her lost son, even though the people around her are convinced she is crazy.<br /><br />Julianne Moore plays the main character, Telly Parada. She performs her role very well, with plenty of emotion. One of her co- stars, Dominic West who plays Ash Correll, is also pretty good. Ash is a guy who lost a daughter in the same plane crash and he, too, cannot recall ever having a daughter when the two meet for the first time after the accident. But Telly's persistence jogs his memory and he realizes he does have a daughter but he has no idea what has happened to her or what has caused his lapse in memory.<br /><br />This movie offers some good suspense and some good shock value. You don't know exactly what will happen and you find yourself slowly putting the pieces of the puzzle together as the film progresses. And there are some great, shocking scenes. Be careful what you have in your hands when you watch this movie because there is a good chance you will end up wearing any food or drink that happens to occupy your fingertips.<br /><br />On the negative side, this movie has some gaping holes in its plot and it leaves many questions unanswered. At the end, you feel relieved that Telly has found out the truth because you can easily see how this ordeal is driving her (and you) crazy. But you don't feel a sense of completeness with so many unresolved issues/questions.<br /><br />Still, the Forgotten is a fairly good movie. It's not going to take home any Oscars and most avid movie goers will have "forgotten" all about this film a few weeks after viewing. But it still has enough positive qualities to give it a small recommendation.</p></body></html>

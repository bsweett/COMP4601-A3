My expectations were actually blasted up to kingdom come!  I could not believe what a fantastic film this was, when it came together.<br /><br />Some of my favorite aspects:<br /><br />I loved the blond prostitute scene, getting boinked DOGGY-STYLE.  That was very nice to watch.<br /><br />I love the idea of the nosy neighbor, played by Lucy Liu.  I always think of her as a "brain" and its fun to see her here, as sort of a "smart" ditz, if you know what I mean.  Plus I love the fact that she and the Josh character fall for each other, and I love seeing her bangin' body get all freaky with him.<br /><br />Bangin'!<br /><br />I recommend this movie, and hope that I helped you make a decision about purchasing it.<br /><br />MC White said:  Totally bangin'!!!</p></body></html>

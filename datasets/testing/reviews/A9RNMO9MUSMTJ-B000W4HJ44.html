<meta name="summary" content="A fun movie"></head><body><p>A movie with lots of energy. It does'nt stop..it goes on and on with musical<br />numbers,good acting, dancing and we get to see great actors like Christopher<br />and John Travolta take on roles that they would usually not do. Lots of fun,<br />and if you have music in your heart....you wont fall asleep on this one.</p></body></html>

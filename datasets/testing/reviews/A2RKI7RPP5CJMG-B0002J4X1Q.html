<meta name="summary" content="Slick Zombie/Action Flick"></head><body><p>"Resident Evil" is actually a pretty cool movie.  I've never played the game(though I've been aware of it since it originally came out), so I don't have anything outside of the actual movie to base this review on.  I was expecting a mediocre action yarn about zombies run amok.  What I got was a lot better than expected.  Milla Jovovich is good as the brains/beauty heroine of this flick.  She's very believable.  Michelle Rodriguez is also good as the tough-as-nails soldier.  The rest of the cast does a very good job(including the walking dead).  The story is pretty good considering that it is based on a video game.  I'm assuming that the game is just as complex and confusing with its plot.<br /><br />I spent the first minutes of the film confused about what was exactly going on, which probably happened to everyone who hasn't played the game.  Once the plot has been set, though, the movie is easy to follow and the action is very good.  The soundtrack is fitting for a movie like this.  It has a horror/techno vibe to it, not unlike "Blade."<br /><br />As stated before, the action is very good.  It is paced just right and there are very few lulls in the action once the movie gets rolling.  The special effects are good, but are sort of awkward at times.  The mutated creature looked pretty fake due to some "Mortal Kombat"-type CGI.  Both films shared the same director, so that doesn't surprise me.  This film is, however, superior to "Mortal Kombat."  One thing that impressed me the most about this film is that it had slick set design and good lighting.  Most films in this genre tend to darken things up a bit in an attempt to hide flaws in the special effects.  "Resident Evil" lets you view all of the action, even though some of it is looks a bit fake, in great lighting.  No squinting to do, which is a good thing.  That's one of the main reasons I let some of the CGI screw-ups slip by.<br /><br />The horror aspect of this film was basically a lot of "jump-at-you" scares.  I enjoyed that, but I feel that this movie is better categorized as an action flick.<br /><br />As far as the DVD goes, the special features were par for the course on this type of film.  Lots of "making of" segments, which were fun to watch, are included.  There's also a filmography of the main characters and the director.  The free ticket to "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" was also a nice touch, and I'll definitely go check it out.<br /><br />Overall, a nice action flick that does good for the Milla Jovovich machine.  It's worthy of multiple viewings, but if you aren't into action/gore films, you may want to avoid this one.</p></body></html>

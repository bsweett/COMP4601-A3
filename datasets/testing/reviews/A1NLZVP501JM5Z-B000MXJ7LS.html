<meta name="summary" content="Well.  Heres my review of........."></head><body><p>a movie about 2 men trapped in a pile of rubble.  This movie sumarizes the events of......9/11? Hmmm.  Um.  Well okay, but weren't there more than 2 men trapped in a pile of rubble that day?  More people trapped on the higher floors who had to jump from the building?  Okay.  Well in this movie about these 2 men they become trapped in rubble and help keep each other alive.  They are trapped in a building.....what?  The World Trade Center?  Hmmm.  I don't remember....AH!  Yes now I remember, sorry folks I forgot about the 30 second shot of the Towers, my bad.  Alright.  It also deals with what there families are going through and how they react to the situation.  Curiously, it doesn't show anyone else in the rubble or anyone else's families in pain.<br /><br />Wierd.  Very wierd.  It makes it seem as if this day of tradgedy and horror was only expierienced by a few and not by many, that is why in my eyes this movie fails at what United 93 did.  United 93 did not try to hide the horror or make us feel a certain way, it gave us the facts and left the rest up to us.</p></body></html>

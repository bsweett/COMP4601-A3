<meta name="summary" content="Awesome Christmas Family Fun!!!"></head><body><p>For me, this is a childhood favorite! We watch it every Christmas, and when they show it on tv for 24 hours. I love how it has the classic look of the 40's! I have a lot of favorite parts that there are too many to list. In case you are new, I'll give you a brief synopsis; Ralphie Parker wants an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle (BB Gun) for Christmas, but his mother, teacher, and Santa Claus keep telling him "You'll shoot your eye out" Will Ralphie get his BB gun? If you love Christmas, comedies, and classics, you'll love A CHRISTMAS STORY!!!</p></body></html>

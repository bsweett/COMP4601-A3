I wasn't sure what to except when I watched it but I was completely fascinated by this little gem of a film. Leonard (Pearce) suffers from short term memory loss, the film goes backwards, it is not too confusing, just concentrate and you'll figure out the twist ending (I guess that would make the ending the beginning). Leonard takes poloraids of all the things he will forget later on. The film is shot in black and white and color. I highly recommend checking out Memento, I highly recommend checking out Memento. Just a little short term memory loss humor for you, enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superman Returns"></head><body><p>This is an awesome movie. i was kind of woried about this guy playing superman. but he did a good job. garantee he will be no christopher reeve but he did superman in his one way which was cool. i think brandon roth did the character justice and kevin spacy did an excelent lex luthor. this was a good fresh start on a new superman hopefully he will stick with it. one thing i did like about this movie was that it was a continuance not a remake or reboot. this is a awesome film. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></body></html>

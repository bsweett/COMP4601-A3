<meta name="summary" content="Breaking up is hard to do"></head><body><p>Jennifer Anniston and Vince Vaughn star in this movie which is labeled a romantic comedy.  Neither the word "romantic" nor "comedy" can easily be applied to this film.  It is the anatomy of the breakup of a relationship.  She feels that she does everything for him and he doesn't appreciate it and he wants more freedom and space to do his own thing.  What starts out as a simple squabble becomes frought with past baggage from the relationship and each of the partners does his/her best to hurt and ignore the other one.  They continue to share their condo since neither one wants to move out, and this movie becomes drearier as it goes on.  Don't rent it if your looking for a light and enjoyable movie.</p></body></html>

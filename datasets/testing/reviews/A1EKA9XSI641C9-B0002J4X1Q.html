The other thing that annoys me is the fact that 2/3 of the characters are killed in about 5 minutes and we don't even get to really know half of them.  Other than that the visual style, special effects, and story of the movie all add together to produce an entertaining sci-fi horror movie that will hopefully not cause an outrage amongst die hard fans of the video games.  This isn't meant to be a re-make of the first game, but it does use some similar elements and some completely knew ones.  If you enjoy Paul Anderson's other works such as Soldier, Event Horizon, and/or AvP, you'll probably like this.  If you only go for Spielberg type movies than stay away from this at all costs.</p></body></html>

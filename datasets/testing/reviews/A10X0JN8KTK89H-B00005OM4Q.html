<meta name="summary" content="A Review of the Theatrical Version - please view the Director's Cut for a fuller experience"></head><body><p>I truly enjoyed this film, over-enjoyed it in fact.  There are far too many wonderful scenes, great joints of dialogue, and an overflow of brooding young men and women.  I felt like I had no character on which to focus my sympathy.  I wanted to focus on the perspective of the young writer, William Miller (played expertly by Patrick Fugit), but the film wouldn't let me.  I wanted to envision Russell Hammond (played genuinely by Billy Crudup), but I couldn't decide if he was a rock star, a little boy trapped in a man's body, or a surrogate father to William.  I didn't understand Kate Hudson's Oscar nomination, but I understood Frances McDormand's.  And why the hell Philip Seymour Hoffman wasn't nominated, I'll never understand.  Something was going on in this movie that confused me.<br /><br />I think the greatest flaw in this movie - the theatrical version, at least - is that there are simply too many great performances and too many fascinating characters for the film to center itself.  I'm positive that the director's cut is the version to see.  The theater cut was pieced together with an air of sadness in order to meet a marketable time limit.  I felt like I was missing a lot of back-story, supporting roles, and important moments.  If you have never seen this movie, avoid the theatrical version.  It is severely dismembered, and it's clear that the director (Cameron Crowe) had more to show the viewer.  The director's cut is over forty minutes longer, and I look forward to seeing it.<br /><br />I probably should at least attempt to place this movie.  The film covers the 1973-74 tours of the band Stillwater.  There were an actual band back then, but the majority of their representation is fabricated for the sake of the movie.  Most of the music in the film is representative of the time period and not so much from the band.  Thus, this is not a true biopic, but an imagined biopic, a movie about a band that was, as the title states, almost famous.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WHAT A WASTE OF TIME"></head><body><p>From the moment I first saw the trailer to this movie, i thought the CGI looked extremly bad. And as soon as I saw it, i knew there would be a long drawn out boring interveiw with someone at I.L.M bragging about how there latest computer desighn was the best they have ever done: and I was right! Not more then 2 days later there was a thing on TV about the making of this movie, and sure enough, theres the guy raving on about how realistic this charactor of the Hulk looks. How wrong they are.<p>If it wasnt for my old man buying it ex-rental after I told him 100 times not to buy it, he bought it, and I suffered through watching it, just incase I was wrong and it was an ok movie? But my hunch was right, i should not have watched it... If your a fan, or remember the original TV series of the Hulk, then dont expect this movie to have anything to do with that, it's like how they took Godzilla and changed that in the latest one they made. The Hulk stars Aussie EX-comedian Eric Bana, who at one point was one of the funniest people on Australian T.V with his performances in stand up and sketch comedy which are the way I wish to remember him. This movie, however, was completly boring, had plots just going no-where, the most boring dialog, and as i said, the worst CGI effects of the year!<p>Dont just take my word for it, just look at how many second hand copys there are currently selling right now? and how much for?!<p>I wouldnt recomend you even watch this movie for free. It's not even worth renting! And above all, I cant beleive there going to make a seaqull to this god awfull, terrible movie!<p>If there going to make all the old super hero's make a come back? then why not go for somthign with them all in it? like that cartoon Justice League? Make that a movie, that would be somthing intresting, instead, here is your classic exsample of Hollyweed completly dry out of ideas, and recycling old ideas, old shows, old movies, and putting CGI to them expecting it to be a hit.... well, it didnt work for me, they need to learn to stop worrying so much about CGI effects and think about how to give a storyline a great plot.<p>I'd tell you about the extra features, and if there's any egg's...but I hated the movie so much, i didnt even bother to stick the second disc in to look at it!</p></body></html>

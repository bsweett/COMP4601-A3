<meta name="summary" content="Nicholas Cage on Botox : An Experiment gone Wrong"></head><body><p>I have never been a Nicholas Cage fan, but he stoops to new lows (even for him) on this abysmal comic book adaptation. The only reason I remember this movie from the theater is the point when he strips naked to reveal some killer abs, at which point everyone in the hall was really into the film for about two minutes.<br /><br />This film has everything going for it - great special effects, a villain with real power and charisma (in fact, he was the star of the show, for me), and a gorgeous heroine who should have been given more screentime. Why they chose the old and out of talent Nicholas Cage to headline this otherwise stellar enterprise is beyond me. I mean, the man has nothing. Virtually nothing at all. There is no screen presence here, no memorable dialogue, and he really looks like one of those 50+ men who inject themselves with botox and believe that they look 25 again. Seriously, it IS that bad - I dare you to watch it and say anything remotely positive about his disgusting performance in this film.<br /><br />Granted, a film of this sort is ludicrous, but when a TV show can get the premise better ("Supernatural" anyone?), its time to worry. I can say that the bike stunts were nice, and the 'head' effects were pretty stellar too. Its just that the romance is a bit convoluted even for a fantasy film of this sort, and lead actress Eva Mendes looks so detached and disinterested in her surroundings, its as if she belongs in some other film entirely. Now, this is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, but what happened to the hair and make-up here. Eva could have been presented so, so much better.<br /><br />The climax was great though - I always enjoy the concept of good vs. evil, and the storyline of selling your soul to the devil. This film captures that, but when compared to other films of a somewhat similar genre (such as the far superior and almost classic "Constantine"), it falters quite a bit. For that reason, this remains a novelty piece with very little repeat value. Well, maybe you'll watch it twice if you're into bikes, but beyond that, believe me, its a tiring exercise.<br /><br />Two Stars. Casting the overrated and useless Nicholas Cage in this ruined all their chances. I can imagine someone like James Franco (best actor in Hollywood right now, right after Leo) pulling this off. In fact, I spent half my time in the seat wondering how wonderful it would be if a certain scene had been given to James Franco instead - now THATS the "Ghost Rider" I want to see.<br /><br />Watch this if you want to watch an over-the-hill and hideous Nicholas Cage run around in tights like a little girl. If that sort of thing is your bag, grab this immediately. If its not, I suggest writing a letter to the studio protesting the ruin of an otherwise possibly excellent film.</p></body></html>

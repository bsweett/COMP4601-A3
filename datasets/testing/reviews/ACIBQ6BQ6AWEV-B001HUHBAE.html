<meta name="summary" content="Obession"></head><body><p>The single most famous unidentified serial killer of the 20th Century, The Zodiac terrorized California with seven confirmed victims between 1968 and 1969 and numerous letters to area media--most specifically San Francisco newspapers--between 1969 and at least 1974.  No one was arrested for the crimes, which remain unsolved to this day.<br /><br />This would seem to place ZODIAC in the interesting position of being a mystery without a solution, but this is not really the case.  Like author Robert Graysmith, from whose book which it is largely drawn, ZODIAC strongly supports a particular notion about the killer's identity.  Even so, the film is actually less about the killer and his crimes than it is about the way in which a great number of people become obsessed with the case and how it impacts their lives.<br /><br />ZODIAC focuses on three men: reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), both with the San Francisco Chronicle, and Inspector David Toshi (Mark Ruffalo) of the San Francisco Police Department.  In one way or another, the case seems to destroy the lives of those most particularly involved in its processes, and the film hands off its action and point of view from one man to the next until it comes to rest on Graysmith, whose obession with the case leads him to put his family at risk and places his marriage in jeopardy.<br /><br />Any one coming to ZODIAC with the idea that it will contain the same sort of jolts as such films as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS will likely be very, very disappointed: the violence involved is seldom graphic, the pace is very deliberate, and the film frequently raises tags that are never really resolved.  When ZODIAC comes to an end we know who Graysmith believes to be the killer, but there is no hard and fast proof one way or another, so there is no firm resolution.  If this sounds unfortunate, it is not: it is considerably more creepy than anything you might imagine.<br /><br />The performances are excellent throughout the entire film, the direction walks a fine line between being excessively low-key and over-extension, and the cinematography and art direction are memorable.  Although the original DVD release offers a handsome print, it is worth pointing out that it includes no extras of any kind--hardcore fans will no doubt prefer the double DVD "special" release.

<meta name="summary" content="Be careful with that dragon!"></head><body><p>This film endeared itself to me from the moment I heard the name of the young hero - Hiccup! Yes, apparently, in Viking lore, the more unpleasant one's name, the greater the chances of avoiding trolls and all manner of unpleasantness. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is a young Viking lad, who lives in an isolated Viking village far from the rest of civilization, and where most of the population is engaged in defending their village from marauding dragons of all kinds. Hiccup feels he is a disappointment to his father, Viking leader Stoick (voiced by Scotsman Gerard Butler) whose sole purpose in life is to kill dragons. Hiccup initially believes the way to his father's heart and that of a comely Viking lass, Astrid (America Ferrara), is to prove himself by killing a dragon. Since he possesses a small build, his only hope of killing a dragon is through ingenious means, and Hiccup invents a contraption that elicits derision from others, but one night, during a fierce dragon attack, Hiccup actually manages to catch a dragon. Unfortunately for Hiccup, the dragon disappears into the forest and no one believes him.<br /><br />Later, Hiccup who has already been labeled a hopeless case by his peers and fellow villagers is compelled to enter dragon-fighting training - with fellow trainees Astrid, Fishlegs (Christopher Mintze-Plasse), Snotlout (Jonah Hill), and twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut (Kristen Wiig and T.J. MIller). This is also the time Hiccup discovers the missing dragon, which turns out to be of the Night Fury variety of dragon - so swift that never has one been captured and nothing is known of it.<br /><br />The story moves along at a suitable pace and never lags - nor is it paced too fast. The story is allowed to develop as well as the characters- especially of the dragon "Toothless" and the boy Hiccup. The evolving relationship between dragon and boy is one of the sweetest highlights of the movie. The viewer gets to witness the slow progression from mistrust and suspicion (on the part of the dragon) and fear (on Hiccup's side) to gradual friendship, trust, and a deep, abiding sense of loyalty. The dragons featured in this film do not speak, which to me is a bonus - they convey their emotions through their eyes (and boy, does Toothless have a pair of expressive ones) and actions.<br /><br />The dragons are a joy to watch - there are all sorts of varieties, from the clumsy, stocky ones to the long-necked, elegant ones, and truly ferocious, mean-looking ones. The twist halfway through the story kept the plot interesting and fresh. There's also a startling twist towards the end that challenges the traditional manner of approaching kid's movies (to say more would constitute a spoiler).<br /><br />The humor is pitched at an appropriate level - kids will get most of it, and adults will find some amusing bits as well, though this is very much a kids' movie (no pop culture references here) and a movie for the kids in all of us. I loved the messages conveyed in this movie - that it's okay to be different, in fact marching to the beat of a different drum (as portrayed by Hiccup's character) is something desirable and not to be mocked at or belittled. The movie also provides educational insights - Hiccup's methods in gaining Toothless' trust and obedience is reminiscent of how humans train dogs/horses, and his various experiments in determining what repels dragons will encourage inquiry thinking in young children (great discussion point for parents and children here).<br />The concept of hands-on learning is prevalent throughout the movie. The themes of friendship, loyalty, and communication between parent and child are also strongly emphasized to good effect.<br /><br />The effects are amazing - watching dragons in flight, especially in 3-D is pure poetry and the battle scenes are well done, without going over the top on the violent bits. The movie is rated PG for sequences of intense action and some scary scenes, and brief mild language. I did not find anything in this movie which was offensive, and we (husband and I) took our 5-year-old to watch it - all three of us enjoyed it immensely. The movie runs about 98 minutes. Final verdict - fun and wonderful entertainment for the entire family, and certainly worth splurging on the 3-D.</p></body></html>

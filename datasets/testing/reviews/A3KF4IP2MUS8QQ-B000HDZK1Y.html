Of course, it may be the only friar-turned-wrestler movie ever made, but that doesn't matter.  What does matter is the fact that Jack Black is funny enough to make a dumb story like this one quite entertaining.  I don't see Nacho Libre being made without Jack Black.  Imagine pitching the story to a studio.  The setting is a Mexican orphanage, and there's this friar named Ignacio (Jack Black) - well, he's not really a friar, okay he's sort of a friar, and he cooks for the children - but he has always wanted to be a wrestler (whom we'll call Nacho for fairly obvious reasons).  I know what you're thinking - the church tends to frown on violence - and that's why he wears a disguise.  But here's the best part - he's doing it for the children, so he can afford to feed them something better than nasty beans and nachos, etc.  Um, we also, in Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Requera), have this really hot nun for our friar/wrestler to take a fancy to.  Granted, that's getting dangerously into taboo territory, but it can't be helped.  Let's face it, no man is going to get in a ring with a bunch of killers unless he's trying to impress a woman.<br /><br />Don't be expecting all of the inane antics of American professional wrestling.  This story takes place (and was filmed) in Mexico, where luchadors actually earn a lot of respect for their dangerous work.  You also have a plethora of guys getting in the ring - short guys, skinny guys, overweight guys, you name it, they all mix it up with chiseled athletes such as the champ, Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez).  Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), Nacho's tag-team partner (whom he met fighting over a bag of nachos) is 6'2" and maybe 105 pounds soaking wet.  Not surprisingly, this new tag-team struggles coming out of the gate, but Nacho is determined to be a champion and maybe even impress Sister Encarnacion in the process with his manliness.  He tries learning the ways of the eagle, prayer, and even a commitment to turn over all prize money to the orphanage, but even still he can't get over the hump and actually win a match.  The local crowd loves the masked Nacho and his skinny sidekick, though, so they get to fight every week and take home some money to help the kids.<br /><br />Ignacio can only keep his secret for so long, of course, which puts him at odds with the other friars who always treat him shabbily, anyway.  When his big chance to win a fight against the local champion, Ramses, doesn't pan out, he really hits the proverbial bottom.  Banished from the monastery, alienated from the orphans he cares about so much, having blown his chance at wrestling stardom, and completely nacho-free, what will become of him?  Who's going to teach Ramses all about the deadly sin of vanity?  And what will become of Sister Encarnacion and all of the orphans?<br /><br />Apart from addressing the question of whether fighting is always sinful, and addressing the plight of the orphans and their need of a hero, there's really no substance to this movie at all.  Who cares, though?  Jack Black's antics in the monastery as well as in the ring are consistently funny, the whole underdog theme works as well as it always does, and you even have a gorgeous woman adorning the somber halls of the austere monastery.  Nacho Libre is everything you could want in a wrestling friar comedy.  And, yes, I thought the accent was pretty darn funny.</p></body></html>

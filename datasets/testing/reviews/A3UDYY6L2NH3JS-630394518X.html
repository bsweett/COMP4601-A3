<meta name="summary" content="The sign of Satan"></head><body><p>This film is the attempt to show the deep-running debate within the police about the profiling technique of the FBI. The old black detective goes along that line and tries to understand the religious and cultural  motivations of the killer and finds them in Chaucer, Dante, Milton, and the  killer's references to the Seven Deadly Sins. The young white detective  follows his instinct and feeling in front of facts and crime-scene  elements. That helps him find the essential clue that will bring the film  to its end. But, not understanding the motivation of the killer, he will  neglect some simple security measures concerning his wife, and will not  understand how the killer is trapping him little by little in the seventh  deadly sin, wrath. So he will fall in the trap. This film is entirely  symbolical, every detail having a deeper meaning if it is read in the line  of the religious and cultural references. The killer is a preacher who is  trying to preach to the world the necessary crusade to be undertaken  urgently if the world is to be saved. We have here a motivation that  associates religion, the desire to punish, the ambition to be God, and the  most reactionary ideology that considers that freedom in our world produces  sin and decay. The man is a fundamentalist who tries to go back to the  Middle Ages, when religion was fundamentalistic. He forgets one thing : the  books he quotes had a double meaning. They reflected this fundamentalistic  religion of the time, and they spoke with the authors' tongues in their  cheeks, becoming hence a subtle denunciation of that fundamentalism and a  call for a liberation of man's pirit and soul from this total alienation to  a belief that is nothing but a superstition. We must also understand that,  in the world, there are people who do think like that, and in some  countries which have such a fundamentalistic approach of religion they  commit all the crimes that go along with it, and of course all the  limitations of freedom and private life.

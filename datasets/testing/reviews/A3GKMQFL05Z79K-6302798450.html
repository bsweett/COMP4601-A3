<meta name="summary" content="Army of Darkness........"Hail to the king, baby!""></head><body><p>Army of Darkness is the third part of the "Evil Dead" trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. It was released in 1993 & starred Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Marcus Gilbert, and the more widely known Bridget Fonda. The screenplay for the movie was written, mostly, in 1988. Sadly, though, this movie didn't do so well at the box-office. Yet, with it's release on video and DVD, it's found moderate success and has also garnered a cult following like the first two movies. In my opinion, it's the best movie out of them all. It's spawned comics, videogames. It's inspired in songs and horror stories. In this installment, Ash is sent back to Medieval times in his Oldsmobile, an event caused by reading a spell from The Book of the Dead to defeat the demons from the last movie. He is believed to be the 'hero from the sky' destined to deliver salvation to mankind from the "Deadites". The only way to return to his time and stop the Deadites, according to a priest, is to retrieve the Necronomicon. This proves to be quite a task for Ash. Without giving away the rest of the movie, let's just say Ash has his work cut out for him. Will he make it back to his time and defeat the Deadites? You'll have to watch the movie and see.<br /><br />Although this is a fine finish to a great trilogy, I hope it isn't the last we see of Ol' Ash. Hopefully, down the road at some point, we'll see Ash return again for another adventure.<br /><br />Til then, do yourself a favor and add this gem to the rest of your collection. It's a great movie and another classic.</p></body></html>

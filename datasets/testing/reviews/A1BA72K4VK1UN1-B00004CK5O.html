<meta name="summary" content="A bizarre rendering of Greene's masterpiece"></head><body><p>Graham Greene originally wrote "The Third Man," a fine novel of intrigue about Post WW II Vienna, Austria, when the city, for a time, was divided up amongst frequently adversarial "Allies".<br /><br />In both the book and the movie, a man named Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten) is down on his luck -- a well-to-do acquaintance in Vienna, Harry Lime (Orson Wells), sends him passage to this city of possible opportunity in which Holly envisions a lot of promise... but when Holly arrives in Vienna, his pal, Harry, is being buried! The ambiance of the book/film is that of political intrigue combined with a murder mystery.<br /><br />I'll summarize this film up front: Here, we have yet another bizarre film associated with Orson Wells. Yes, the film has been highly acclaimed in the past by critics as being "artful"... but this movie fails utterly for the average viewer today.<br /><br />The transitions from one scene to the next are very abrupt. This is quite distracting. Also, they've taken Greene's clear, straightforward story and made it notably incoherent. And it's clear that a huge priority for Orson Wells was to focus upon his personal "surprised-look-profile" for whatever time he's on screen -- his personal vanity ultimately dominates the story. The film climaxes in a multi-national foot chase through the active underground sewers of Vienna which drags on for much too long.<br /><br />The worst facet of this flick is the weird filmscore -- the director decided to have the entire filmscore rendered by some guy who singularly played old Bavarian pub songs on a Zither! Don't know what a Zither is? It's the only musical instrument that is actually more noxious than an accordion! The end product is that the music comes off as distracting and totally inappropriate to the various dramatic scenes.<br /><br />Finally, I DO need to point out that Joseph Cotten's performance in this film was indeed very good. Unfortunately, he had little with which to work.<br /><br />You might wish to view this film as a curiosity but, beyond that, you're probably going to be shaking your head at what they did to Graham Greene's fine volume of period literature.</p></body></html>

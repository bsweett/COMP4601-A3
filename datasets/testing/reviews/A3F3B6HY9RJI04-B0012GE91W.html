<meta name="summary" content="A True Adaption"></head><body><p>A lot of my annoyances in previous Harry Potter movies have been the changes, diversion, and other "artistic privileges" taken while adapting the book into a movie.<br /><br />Of the five Harry Potter movies thus far, I think this one stayed more true to the book than any of the others.  And let me tell you, that means a lot to me.<br /><br />Otherwise, there were very few other flaws.<br /><br />The acting was fantastic.  These kid actors have really graduated into true actors.  Of all of them, I think there was only one who was a little bit too over-the-top still.  But Daniel Radcliff as Harry Potter was spot-on.  Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley could not have done a better job as Harry's most noble friend and protector.<br /><br />Two performances really stood out for me.  The first was Gary Oldman who has always been a standout performer.  I think he really outdid himself as Harry's Godfather, Sirius Black.  It is too bad that this will be his last appearance in these films unless there is something I don't know about in the seven book (9 more days!!!  I can't wait!).  The other performance was by the newcomer of the series, Evanna Lynch, who could not have played the "dreamy" Luna Lovegood any better.  She did a fantastic job and I look forward to seeing her throughout the rest of the series.<br /><br />The special effects were awesome, especially with the showdown between Dumbledore and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the end of the movie.  I think the entire theater were on the edge of their seats!  Also, the training of Dumbledore's Army was beautifully done.<br /><br />Like the books and the other movies, there was a lot of good humor throughout the movie.  The scene I was most looking forward to was the scene involving the twins when they can't take the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher anymore.  The entire theater was laughing their heads off.  It was great and couldn't have been done better.  That scene was one of the highlights this gem of a movie.<br /><br />I now remember one of my frustrations when I reviews this book when it first came out, and that was how emotionally charged Harry Potter was.  I thought he spent the first half of the book just being a jerk.  The movie actually did a better job than the book of showing WHY he was upset and angry and overly emotional.  Again, I think the fine talents of Gary Oldman helped with this.  But the director did a fantastic job of actually SHOWING us what Harry Potter was going through and why he was so emotionally charged.<br /><br />I think in the end, this will be one of the stronger movies.  Those who have read the book will finally have a movie to see they won't be groaning to throughout.  I was glad to hear the same director (David Yates) will helm the next movie and I hope he continues the excellent work he put into this movie.<br /><br />This easily deserves five stars!</p></body></html>

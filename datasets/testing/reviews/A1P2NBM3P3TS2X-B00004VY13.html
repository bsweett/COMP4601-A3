<meta name="summary" content="Better video/audio, slightly fewer extras"></head><body><p>Not all of the bonus content from the DVD was carried over to the Blu-ray, and no one is really sure why.  But a large chunk of the behind-the-scenes documentary is included in the U-Control feature, as well as a few moments here and there that were not included on the DVD.  The commentary track is the same.<br /><br />The experience you get from the U-Control footage (done as picture-in-picture) is largely the same as the experience you get watching the DVD bonus content.  Not exactly the same, but close enough.<br /><br />Excellent picture and sound quality on this Blu-ray and the price is certainly right.</p></body></html>

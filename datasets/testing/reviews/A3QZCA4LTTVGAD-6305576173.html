<meta name="summary" content="A comedy with brains and heart"></head><body><p>Mel Brooks' &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; is a remarkable film: it is a spoof of a beloved classic (the original film version of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;) which is now a beloved classic in its own right. A fun homage to YF was rendered by the irreverent sci-fi series &quot;Farscape,&quot; in which wisecracking lead character Crichton referred to a sinister alien adversary as &quot;Frau Blucher&quot;--the name of Cloris Leachman's YF character.<p>YF is both a spoof and a sequel of the original &quot;Frankenstein&quot; film. It concerns a young scientist (the brilliant Gene Wilder) who is heir to both the name and legacy of the infamous scientist who created a monster from dead human remains. Young Frankenstein takes up the family tradition with outrageously funny results.<p>Several elements combine to make YF one of cinema's all-time great comedies: witty dialogue, deliciously eccentric characters, hilarious sight gags (&quot;Put--the candle--back&quot;), and one of the best comic ensembles ever assembled on film. On top of that, the production design, costumes, and make-up brilliantly evoke the classic Hollywood &quot;monster movie&quot; vibe. And there's a great humorous song-and-dance sequence for the doctor and his creation.<p>As funny as it is, YF is also a deeply compassionate and humanistic film. Brooks treats his zany collection of characters with genuine affection. &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; ultimately has a kind-heartedness to match both its intelligence and wit.</p></body></html>

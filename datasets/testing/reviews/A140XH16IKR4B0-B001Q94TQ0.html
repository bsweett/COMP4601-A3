She quits her job dethorning roses and agrees to act as a "mule" for a cabal of drug dealers. The film is mainly interesting for its depictions of the trials that are part-and-parcel of her decision: learning to swallow marshmallow-sized "pellets" of latex-wrapped cocaine and heroin; trying to keep the pellets down during a long flight to the US; encounters with suspicious customs officials and vicious drug handlers. The film gives us a fascinating look  at the Columbian community in New York, showing us drug enforcers, immigrants working form better lives for their children, as well as neighborhood fixers who help their countrymen through the vicissitudes of adjusting to American life.<br /><br />As a window into a world I did not know, "Maria Full of Grace" was extraordinary in spite of a few limitations. The acting (especially on the part of Catalina Sandino Moreno, who played the film's heroine, Maria Alvarez) was underplayed to the extent of woodenness. The film also lost a chance to show the other end of the drug trade -- those who use the product Maria was smuggling. Yet the film is successful in tracing the path of one young woman from an unfulfilling life, through a journey through hell, to what one hopes is a more auspicious future.</p></body></html>

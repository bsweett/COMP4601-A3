<meta name="summary" content="Comic farce does not attain the high expecations of a John Cusack movie"></head><body><p>"Hot Tub Time Machine" looks like it was a heck of a lot of fun to make and to write.  John Cusack has a well-earned reputation as one of the Smart Guys in Hollywood - always reliable for delivering intelligent, wise, clever lines with humility and perfect comic timing.  Rob Corddry earned his stripes on the brilliant "Daily Show."  Craig Robinson never disappoints on "The Office."  This movie promises much . . . but unfortunately fails to deliver on its full promise.<br /><br />The plot is well-known.  Three buds and a nerdy nephew go back to the 1980's via the most ridiculous time machine since Bill and Ted were famous.  Virtually all the action takes place at one of those ski towns where everybody wants to "Party!!!!!"  Especially the nubile and loose bevy of gorgeously big-busted women who I never saw in Whitefish, Montana when I went skiing in the 1980's.  We get a bunch of 1980's-inspired humor, some of it great but some of it rather sophomoric ("What color is Michael Jackson?" has been done.  A lot.).<br /><br />What ensues is a tepid romp through time-travel cliches, T&A humor, and some rare moments of inspired hilarity.  The best running gag is the secret of just how Crispin Glover loses his arm (and Corddry's continued aggravation at the arm's series of near-misses).  Indeed, Corddry essentially steals this show as his head-banging, extremely profane Lou gets to exorcise some inner demons.  Corddry's got that gift of being able to look at even the most absurd situation with complete honesty and conviction, strapping on whatever emotional armor is needed to get things done.  Craig Robinson also has some inspired scenes as a man tortured by the apparent infidelity of his modern-day wife, whom he takes to task in a classic phone call even though back in the 1980's she's only nine years old.<br /><br />John Cusack is the biggest puzzle of this movie.  Cusack may be the ultimate scene stealer in Hollywood because he's so memorable and yet so restrained - he can go toe-to-toe with Jack Black in "High Fidelity" and still remain the heart of the picture.  But in "HTTM," Cusack is strangely unmemorable.  Usually there is at least one line in a John Cusack movie that you walk out repeating to yourself and saying, "I wish I talked that way."  Not in "HTTM."<br /><br />I am not certain if the "Unrated" edition of this movie is any better than the rated version - it does not appear to be any raunchier, but appears to include a few extended comic scenes that probably ended up on the cutting room floor because they don't quite work.<br /><br />A surprising return to the classic T&A comedies of the 1980's, "HTTM" is by no means a bad movie.  It's very funny in moments, but it does suffer from dizzyingly high expectations.</p></body></html>

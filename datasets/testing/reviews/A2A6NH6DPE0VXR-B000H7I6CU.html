The main car voiced by Owen Wilson isn't that likeable in the beginning. He's self-centered and cocky. The movie gets better when he  gets stuck in a small town and forced to fix a wrecked road there if he wants to leave. If he doesn't leave soon he will miss out being in a big race and becoming the big star he wants to be. The longer he's stuck there though the more he finds that he likes it there and the more he learns to be less self-centered. He also learns to care about other people.....oops, I mean other cars.<br /><br />  At first I only found Cars to be a great movie to look at and nothing else. Then I got more and more into the story and I soon found it to be as good as other big Disney Pixar hits like Toy Story 1 and 2 and The Incredibles and Finding Nemo. Cars is a smart, charming and sometimes even a touching film. Disney missed out for being nominated last year for best animated film "thanks to Chicken Little being pretty weak". Cars hopefully won't get ignored when it comes to Oscar time. It looks great and doesn't have a bad story either. The voice actors casted are perfect too. Owen Wilson, Paul Newman and Bonnie Hunt all do fine jobs.</p></body></html>

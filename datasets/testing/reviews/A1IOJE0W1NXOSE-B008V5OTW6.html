This event does occur in the DVD, but it is right at the beginning and the rest of the movie concerns the attempt on the part of Israel to avenge the murders and to kill those responsible.  The narrative is often confusing, and the movie is full of bloody scenes of murder and mayhem, none of which was very appealing to me.  The point of the movie seems to be that revenge never really works and it only becomes dehumanizing to those who engage in it.  I wish I had not sat through almost three hours of this movie in order to come to that conclusion.</p></body></html>

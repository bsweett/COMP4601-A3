<meta name="summary" content="Can Hanks Make a Bad Movie?"></head><body><p>I did not want to see this movie. Even though it stars Tom Hanks, quite frankly, it sounded boring as all get-out. And maybe it could have been, with any other actor.<p>Who else but Tom Hanks can create and sustain a deep and personal relationship with a volleyball upon which he has drawn a face? Who else but Tom Hanks can nearly drown on a crude hand-built raft in high waves, looking for that same volleyball, calling its name and sobbing uncontrollably? Who else but Tom Hanks can have you sobbing with him?<p>I won't review the plot here, since so many other reviewers have done so--and done it well. What I want to concentrate upon is Hanks' truly extraordinary acting ability. As we watch him change from cocky Fed-Ex manager extraordinaire to severely shaken plane crash survivor, to a marooned castaway on a desert island, we are drawn to him simply by the look on his face. Hanks moves from fear to frustration to anger to illness to vulnerability to joy to fear again...all the human emotions, conveyed seemingly effortlessly from a set that we know provided endless hardships for cast and crew.<p>There are innumberable scenes that are unforgettable for the sheer strength of his acting: the above-mentioned grief over Wilson the volleyball is one; the tooth-pulling scene is another; his joy over catching a fish...there are just no words to accurately convey how brilliant this film really is. My advice: see it for yourself. It's an experience you won't soon forget.</p></body></html>

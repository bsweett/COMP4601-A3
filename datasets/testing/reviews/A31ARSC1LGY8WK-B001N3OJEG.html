<meta name="summary" content="Superbly cast modern Film Noir"></head><body><p>"L.A. Confidential" - a classic modern Film Noir - depicts a 1950s Los Angeles riddled with corruption and vice, where no-one can be trusted. Bud White (Russell Crowe) and Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) two "clean" cops with totally contrasting approaches to their work take a stand. Writer/Director Curtis Hanson and Co-Screenwriter Brian Helgeland superbly capture the flavour of the period. The casting is perfect right down to the small roles - and it is ironic that two Australian actors playing the "good" cops should work so well in this most American of genres.</p></body></html>

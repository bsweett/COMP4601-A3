<meta name="summary" content="Violence mars an otherwise very good film"></head><body><p>Unlike some of the other reviewers, it doesn't bother me that rats are cooking food...it's an animated film, right?<br /><br />What *did* bother me was the two scenes of violence, especially Granny with the shotgun. Have we become so desensitized that Gran-Gran going mental and shooting up her house doesn't bother young children?<br /><br />Otherwise I thought it was a well made Pixar film. Lots of fun to watch with kids who love to eat interesting and exotic food. For that matter, it would be a good way to get picky eaters introduced to flavors and trying new things.<br /><br />The flashback sequence with Anton Ego (eating Ratatouille) was so well done it wouldn't have been out of place in a feature film.<br /><br />But that violence really brings it down. It's a "G" movie after all!</p></body></html>

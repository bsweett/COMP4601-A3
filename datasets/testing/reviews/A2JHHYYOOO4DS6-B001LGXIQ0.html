Steve Carell pulls of the perfect agent 86. Is he really smart but covers over it with goofiness or is he just plain dumb yet manages to get it right sometimes. The scene with him acting as marriage counselor in the midst of the fight scene was truly hilarious. This is a movie one can relax to and have lots of laugh.</p></body></html>

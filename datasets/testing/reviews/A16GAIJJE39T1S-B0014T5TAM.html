<meta name="summary" content="The erroneous accusations of a young British girl on the eve of WWII set the stage for tragedy"></head><body><p>A bright and observant young girl, 13 year-old Briony Tallis, sees and puts together events that have escaped the notice of her elders.  Unfortunately, however, young Briony makes the fatal mistake of misconstruing events and accusing her older sister's well-meaning boyfriend of a horrible crime!  Adding to the drama of these events is England's brave fight against the Nazis in the early days of World War II, and the differences of class that complicate the tragic romance of Briony's sister and the maligned boyfriend who is also the son of one of the servants of the aristocratic Tallis family.</p></body></html>

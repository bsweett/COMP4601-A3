<meta name="summary" content="A study in contrasts"></head><body><p>"The Queen"  is, far and away, Stephen Frears' best film to date.  That's saying a lot since his "Dangerous Liasions" is one of my favorite films of all time.  While "Dangerous Liasions" is about power and cruelty,  The Queen allows you a glimpse behind the scenes of power, and illustrates that everyone, no matter how famous or how powerful, stumbles a little in life, and fortunately has a person or persons around them  that save them from themselves.<br /><br />A study in contrasts of style and substance is the theme of the film -- the events that brought together Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) and her new Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen).  Had it not been for the sudden, almost inexplicable death of the tragic Princess Diana, followed by the schism in terms of reaction between her people and the Queen, Elizabeth and Tony may have taken years to get comfortable with one another, years to understand each other, years to forge the kind of relationship that works for the UK.<br /><br />These two actors are brilliant in their roles.  Mirren goes beyond the traditional caricature of the Queen as stodgy, opinionated, and totally in control/disdain of her family members' lives and foibles.  She gives us the Queen as an extraordinary woman made humble by events she did not create and could not fathom.  Her reaction to them, her eventual awareness and response, is, for lack of a better word, queenly.  Mirren, the redoubtable Jane Tennyson of the brilliant "Prime Suspect" series, is the best actress of her time (yes, Meryl Streep, that includes you).  Michael Sheen, on the other hand, may not portray Tony Blair as he really is (how would I know?) but the contrast of his coltish, disarming charm and his leadership style at the beginning of his term as Prime Minister (and the obvious affection from staff and family,  for his ability to be real, to be the kind of leader that one would follow into hell )  to his growing confidence that he can, by the truth of his understanding and  his willingness to continue to persevere, to bring the tragedy from the brink, all of it is captured in his performance.<br /><br />Frears benefits from a brilliant script by Peter Morgan, but turns the script into an extraordinary film by the perfection of his choices and his editing.  He chooses to recreate scenes that have never been filmed (the crowd in front of the hotel before Diana emerged to her car and her subsequent death the scene of Charles arriving at the hospital) and mixes them with real film clips of Diana in life, and some of the real film of the funeral events.  Choosing NOT to recreate Diana with an actress was sheer genius, and the mix of clips and live action was incredibly well done.  Mixing the filmmaker's/writer's interpretation of what must have happened in the series of entreating phone calls between Blair and the Queen, making both vulnerable by showing little shots of daily life -- the cozy, contemporary chaos of the Blair house, the deliberacy of the Queen taking off and putting on her glasses, tells the story of how the power shifted between them (perhaps?) in a way that not even his fine actors could do.  Choosing  a breathtaking but not imposing score for the film and making the shots of Balmoral ( the almost forbidding surroundings) come to life as the barrier between the Queen and her people...well, Frear has taken what could be an ordinary, dull film about a living monarch to the realms of an incredible character study, played out against a backdrop that stands stark in the memory of people all over the world.<br /><br />Was the crown really endangered by Elizabeth's reaction to the tragedy?  Did she change her stance because of the leverage of Blair's campaign, his truth?  Is Frears film opinion, or is it reality?  Somewhere in the middle?  It matters not.  It's unique, it's powerful, it's a shame that it won't be viewed in wider release, because it is the best film, so far, this year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Fantastic Bourne Sequel..."></head><body><p>Only rarely does a sequel equal its predecessor for entertainment value.  Very loosely based on a Robert Ludlum novel, "The Bourne Supremacy" does that, with a breathless stream of action sequences featuring the amnesiac but lethal former CIA assassin Jason Bourne (again played with a pitch-perfect combination of restraint and intensity by Matt Damon).<br /><br />As the movie opens, Bourne is hiding in a seaside village in India with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente from the first movie).  He suffers from flashbacks of which he can make no sense, but he and Marie have built a life together.<br /><br />Four thousand miles away in Berlin, a CIA black operation supervised by CIA Deputy Director Pam Landy (a cooly precise Joan Allen) goes sideways when a mysterious assassin intervenes.  A fingerprint left behind leads Landy to Jason Bourne's identity.  Landy will mount a major operation to hunt down Bourne, enlisting the aid of TREADSTONE veterans Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Nikki Parsons (Julia Stiles) from the first movie.<br /><br />In India, the mysterious assassin from Berlin materializes to hunt Jason Bourne.  He narrowly misses Bourne but kills Marie.  A stoic Bourne returns to Europe on a collision course with the CIA and a shady plot involving a Russian oil magnate and a corrupt CIA insider.  The action will spin from India to Italy to Berlin and finally to Moscow, where a thrilling car chase will bring Bourne face to face with his Russian nemisis.<br /><br />The frantic, grainy, realistic cinematic style of the first movie is duplicated here, building suspense fasther than the viewer can worry about plot holes.  The core of the movie is Bourne's relentless pursuit of his objective, slowed only by his struggle to make sense of flashbacks and the need to bandage the odd wound.  The ending leaves plenty of room for additional sequels.<br /><br />This DVD version contains some interesting extra features about the making of the movie.  "The Bourne Supremacy" is highly recommended as an very entertaining action movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This Movie SO Kicks A-Double-S!"></head><body><p>First off, if you liked "28 Days Later" then you will love "28 Weeks Later"!<br /><br />Secondly, this movie on its own, for those new to the franchise, is just flat-out awesome! The larger budget is well made use of, and what an effective sequel this is.<br /><br />There are a few of the most absolutely gruesome, and incredibly large, magnificent effects you'll ever see in this type of movie right here. You'll just flip. If you can wait until you're able to watch it in high def with 5.1 and a subwoofer, even if it's years down the road, then do so. Don't ruin it by watching it online or on a PSP or on a standard def monaural set or something...this one's a saver to savor!<br /><br />This review reflects my reaction to the film, along with my highest recommendation to others who might enjoy a nice, shocking epidemic movie.<br /><br />If you want the synopsis to the story, check it out in the product description. Otherwise..."28 Weeks Later" is freakin' hardcore outstanding! And it ties in both perfectly and sensibly to "28 Days Later" as well.<br /><br />This Blu-ray version looks and sounds absolutely incredible!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Green Hornet as a Comedy?"></head><body><p>First Impressions:<br /><br />The Green Hornet is based on the original radio serials of the 1930s, predating Batman, yet has enough similarity to make audiences get in tune.<br /><br />This movie was a lot of fun for the most part -- millionaire playboy whose Dad (and now Britt) works at the Daily Sentinel, and has a partner (Jay Chau, Kato) and pretends he is a criminal when he is actually fighting crime.<br /><br />On the Radio:<br /><br />So far, this aligns well with the radio show (except Kato in the radio show was Filipino -- but I digress), except the radio show was straight and this is a comedy. Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet is also the executive producer and the co-screenwriter so this is clearly his baby.<br /><br />I loved the fast cars, the incredible skill of Kato and the egocentric jerk that is Britt Ried! His egomania really gets on Kato's goat and they fight it out with each other -- a slapstick fight that was a bit boring I must admit.<br /><br />Lenore Love Interest:<br /><br />Catherine Diaz plays the secretary who through her criminology knowledge actually unwittingly helping them out with her explanation of gang profile. The subplot of a love triangle was not played up which is fine, since that was not the main theme anyway!<br /><br />The bad guy wants to control all of LA crime. He is paranoid and lives on a trigger. This guy is bloodthirsty and has no qualms about killing people who disagree with him.<br /><br />The impossible stunts, the over-the-top action and the crazy situations the Hornet and Kato get into is just as goofy a comic book-like movie as you can see. There's even panel shots!<br /><br />If you liked other similar films such as Rush Hour or even Lethal Weapon.<br /><br />End Credits Worth the Price!<br /><br />The ending credits play the original Green Hornet theme as composed by Billy May back in the 1930s, and we even listen to the singing of Jay Chau (Kato). Recommended for older teens and adults due to the over-the-top death by car and the gross methods of accidental and purposeful death!<br /><br />Fun film! A nod to Bruce Lee and coffee baristas everywhere, LOL!<br /><br />Michel Gondry ("Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind") directing from a screenplay by star Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg based on the radio series created by George W. Trendle. The movie is played purely for laughs and should be taken that way.</p></body></html>

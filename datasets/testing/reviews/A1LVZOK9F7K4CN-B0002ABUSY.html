<meta name="summary" content="Can't replace the original, but it's still good..."></head><body><p>One of the great things about the movie, Shaun of the Dead, is its awareness that we know all of the conventions of zombie movies all ready.  The remake of Dawn of the Dead shares some of that sensibility.  The classic setup is that, one night, everything is normal, but when the world wakes up the next morning, the apocalypse has come in the form of a war with the undead.  (We've been preparing for it for so long, I'll be a little disappointed if we never have a war with the undead.)  The best part of Dawn of the Dead is how it handles this beginning - the way the central character survives her first zombie attack and heads out of her house to see the chaos that surrounds her.<br /><br />Of course, there is nothing original in this movie.  Lately, the zombie film has been making a comeback and this film is cashing in.  The new model is 28 Days Later, which this film follows; unlike the original, the zombies in this film are strong and fast (where do they get their energy?).  It also steals the "look" of that film, with its strobe-effect shutter speeds.<br /><br />Of course, this film can never replace the original - the earlier film is too important.  However, it is still a good movie.  Think of it as an homage to the original, as opposed to a remake.  In the seventies, George Romero had to work his magic with little or no budget.  The point of this film is to make a zombie film with a big budget, first-class special effects, and good actors.  A lot of the social satire of the film is lost, but it thankfully keeps the bleak outlook of the original films.<br /><br />All in all, it is a worthwhile rental.</p></body></html>

A bomb is about to explode on the television screen. This bomb I'm speaking of can be more easily identified under the alias 'The Green Hornet'. Yes, this film IS that bad! Who would have ever thought someone would portray a superhero in such an unlikeable fashion that the audience would absolutely hate him? I wouldn't have thought it possible but then what do I know.<br /><br />Obviously something went horribly wrong during production. They didn't know whether they should play it straight or go with a comedy touch. The end result was neither. A word to Seth Rogen (aka: Green Hornet). Seth, green is not your color and if you ever don that mask again you may be forced to defend yourself off the screen as well as on it. As for the Hornet's trusted partner Kato (Jay Chou), he was the only redeeming part of the film. Thanks for trying your best to save this dud.</p></body></html>

Showcasing himself as an almost perfect member of the human species possessed by intellect and a higher class superiority, he lives the part of the showman and many a person seems to buy into this presentation. Simply ask his secretary or the droves of females that flock about him, or the ones he approaches and finds thrown aback by the presentation of sophistication and charm within his demeanor. And what's not to like, really, about a member of the upper echelon of society with power, prowess, money, and a keen understanding of how the inner workings of the fraternally upper-class pecking order at his disposal? Besides, he is predisposed when it comes to echoing the sentimentality of success; owning the perfect ensemble, working out to fine-tune the garb underneath those wrappings, and taking great care to ward off blemishes that would others attempt to assail his skin and hair. On top of that he owns a seemingly grandiose apartment, a vast array of electronics that would cost a small fortune, and is fully equipped to feast on the entertainment of the time - especially in the realm of music. Going further, he also understands the ins and outs of wining and dining, partying and the prospective drug use that seems to follow closely in suit, and how to use the vacancies existing within others to benefit himself and further his own needs, and how to starkly mark his territory in the heat of the moment. And then there's his other hobbies...<p>Based loosely on the trails and tribulations echoed throughout Bret Easton Ellis's book, American Psycho - and then only in the fact that some scenes are mimicked in an out-of-order fashion and that disfunctionalities of our main character, Mr. Bateman, are reproduced with stunning beauty -- this movie offers something different to people looking for more than mundaneness housed within murder. While its true that the level of violence that feeds Bateman between the books edges isn't showcased here and is instead left in commentary and implied snippets that sometime explode into the occasional outburst that tries to coat the screen, there are still windows looking into the beast inflicting Patrick's mentality. In fact, American Psycho is, in many ways, a breath of fresh air in a genre that otherwise suffers the platitudes of many and many a directorial mind, feeding its viewer images of a numbing world in which Bateman compares the quality of business cards, the needs to maintain his body, and indulges the monster within the illusion maintained by the man. <p>Readers that approved of the character and his barbed wit will no doubt enjoy Bale's portrayal of the malicious mindset inflicting our upper-class killer, and might actually be surprised at the number of scenes they recognize from the book's pages. Even those who found the book disturbing should enjoy this softer, less graphic portrayal of Bateman's candor, seeing only bits and pieces of the man that is destined to be remembered as a social stamp dictating the excesses of the 80s for generations that weren't privy its influence firsthand.</p></body></html>

Regarding the men, there are absolutely wonderful characters.  You have the fictional baker, a seemingly weak man whom the viewer believes will probably survive, who makes friends with a supposed Kempetai he could not trust; the fanatical sub-commanders who sometimes force their men to suicide; the general Kuribayashi, who saw further than his colleagues and had a wider vision of the world yet persisted in his duty to the end.<br /><br />The most important thing for me was that I empathized so much with all of these men.  It may sound strange, but I lived in Japan and came away with an extremely negative view of its society, which enabled me over the last 20 years to take some pretty rigid stances about it.  In particular, I have felt so disgusted at the brutality of their behavior in China, which the Ministry of Education officially covers over (to this day portraying the Japanese as victims of the war), that I felt we were justified in the way we attacked them in the war and to make some blanket generalizations.  This film has gotten me to question my lack of sympathy for the Japanese who fought, even the misguided fanatics who killed their own men for nothing.  Yes, the Bushido code was twisted to the designs of a militaristic regime, but until now I have wondered how human their soldiers were.  This is the gift that only great art can bestow.<br /><br />REcommended with enthusiasm.</p></body></html>

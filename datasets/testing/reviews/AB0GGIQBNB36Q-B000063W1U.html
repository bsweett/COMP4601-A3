There were three major stories going on this movie, as well as the little side plot with the o'conells son wearing the bracelet of anubis. Now one question, If Evey is Nefertiti reincarnated. Why wasn't that even mentioned slightly in the first movie, I did like the involvement of the Scorpion king. And actually wished he had been the main bad guy of this movie, instead we get imhotep again. Now Arnold Vosloo did an incredible job as Imhotep in the first one, but you stripped him of his powers and shoved him the "pool" and buried him beneath humanaptra. Basically killing him off, but nooooooooooooo, lets bring back his reincarnated girlfriend. She digs him up, but wait, evey's been having strange dreams. Oh I forgot the 4th major story, Rick is a Madji. That's right, he's a warrior for God, as said by Ardeth Bay. Yep, we get a fight at the end between the scorpion king Imhotep, and Rick. Wait... evey's been killed but Her son brings her back to life, with the help of Johnathan, in a replica scene of the ending to the first movie. Well never fear, Rick does kill the scorpion king. Sending him to hell along with Anubis's army, Oh. Halfway through the movie, Ardeth Bay tells rick. That he is a madji, and to prove it, Tells Evey that she's Nefertiti reincarnated, and that Rick is a Reincarnated protector of sorts. Yeeeeeeeeeah, they should've just stuck with the Scorpion King. They still could have had the Mummy pygmies which are hilarious, and Rick could've battled the Scorpion King and won. Too much going on, with villains that should have been left dead. A decent movie, yes I own it, but only for the collections sake. Could've been better.</p></body></html>

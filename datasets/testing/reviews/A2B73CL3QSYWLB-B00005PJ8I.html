This collaboration between director Robert Zemeckis and actor Tom Hanks is, in my mind, virtually flawless and a totally compelling viewing experience.  Those naysayers who would dismiss this film should recognize what a challenge this film is.  Zemeckis(and Hanks) are asking us to follow a story that asks us to follow the transformation of a man whose whole life revolves around punctuality and now finds himself with all the time in the world.  Tom Hanks gives probably his most challenging performance to date.  The scenes on the island where Hanks has few props to work with, if you count "Wilson" the volleyball, are just masterful.  Hanks uses his consummate skills as an actor to pull us in and never lets go.  Though this film was a box office success it received something of a lukewarm critical response.  I would hope that in years to come when the careers of Hanks(and Zemeckis) are evaluated that "Cast Away" is recognized for the great film that it is.</p></body></html>

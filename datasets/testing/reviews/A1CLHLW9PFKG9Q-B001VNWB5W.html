<meta name="summary" content="Boring"></head><body><p>Watched this film on opening day. Watchmen stars Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II (her mom was the original), Billy Crudup plays Dr Manhattan (the only character with super powers in the film), Jackie Haley plays Rorschach (my favorite) the sole remaining vigilante who did not quit when the government ordered the "masks" to stop fighting crime. Jeffrey Morgan plays The Comedian (see picture) whose death begins the story. And Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II (think Batman).<br /><br />Okay, there are many more characters but I don't feel like writing about all of them.<br /><br />The plot, The Comedian is thrown out of a window and Rorshach believes someone is targeting the old crimefighters.<br /><br />His mission is to warn those who he was affiliated with.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr Manhattan, a being who can manipulate matter, is working on a way to harness his energy to create the perfect source of fuel for the world.<br /><br />So is someone going after the Watchmen? And will the world end up nuking themselves to oblivion? Watch the movie.<br /><br />Or don't because it's really long and really boring.<br /><br />Really - really boring.<br /><br />It's directed by the guy who made 300 (another film based on a graphic novel) so there's a lot of slow-motion action scenes with lots of bloody violence and too much nudity.<br /><br />"Too much" you ask? Yes - there really doesn't need to be any. We're talking about a man who glows blue and doesn't wear a single article of clothing...<br /><br />Die hard fans will watch this, but I won't be getting this on DVD</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So What?"></head><body><p>1999 was a really great year for movies and I didn't get to see all the ones I wanted in the theater.  So when this one came out on DVD I bought it from trust in the reviews that it was something great.  Unfortunately there  wasn't much to be seen.  I was completely annoyed with John Cusack's  preformance and I was never taken in by any of the story's quirkiness.  Some genuinely funny moments aside, I am at a loss of words to explain why  this movie was not only on ten best lists, but at the top of them as well.  I agree with another reviewer here with the phrase &quot;different doesn't  mean brilliant&quot;.  Too often these days leading critics are confusing  those two words. While very different, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH was far from  brilliant.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What more can be told about Alice in Wonderland?"></head><body><p>This was a big dissapointment. I am (believe it or not) a fan of the Alice in Wonderland story, which is the reason why I do not like this 3-D version of "Alice in Wonderland"<br /><br />This film is set many years after the first/original version. Alice is about to get married, when once again, she spots the white rabbit, and follows him. Once back in Wonderland Alice embarks on her true destiny: end the red queen's reign of power.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this film really did not have a great plot, it was just same old, same old. Its like Tim Burton was more focused on the special effects then the story-line.</p></body></html>

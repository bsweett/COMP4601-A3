<meta name="summary" content="Not quite what I expected"></head><body><p>Having never read Dennis Lehane's novel, I didn't quite know what to expect of Shutter Island, which re-unites Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese but finds the legendary director in a bit of a change of pace with this suspense/thriller as opposed to his past few works.  DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal who, along with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) come to the island to investigate the disappearance of an inmate of the island's hospital for the criminally insane.  What begins as a "whodunit with everyone hiding something" develops into something else entirely, with a twist that you will more than likely see coming almost a mile away.  That aside though, Shutter Island as a whole is a more than competantly made thriller.  DiCaprio is quite good, as are Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley as the facility's head doctor, with smaller roles from Michelle Williams, Max Von Sydow, Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, and Ted Levine; while the film boasts some wonderful cinematography and film editing.  With a fairly unsettling conclusion, Shutter Island may not be the kind of film that one would expect from Martin Scorsese, but if there's anything that the legendary director may be familiar with, it's with providing audiences with the unexpected, and that in itself makes the film so worthwhile in the first place.</p></body></html>

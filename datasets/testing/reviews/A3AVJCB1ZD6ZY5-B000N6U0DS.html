<meta name="summary" content="This story touches your heart on so many levels"></head><body><p>It's about a father, who doesn't want to become one of those statistic absentee Dads.  It's about a smart man, who's motivated to learn and be at the top of the heap.  It's about a strong man, who keeps on going despite life doing everything it can to knock him down.  And yes, it's about a Black man who succeeds and is still very much his own man.<br /><br />Will Smith and his son Jaden are amazing as the father-son team, but that's not where the story ends.  The minister for a homeless shelter is playing himself.  And the man whose life story is being told has a walk on role, too.<br /><br />By far, one of the most amazing movies I have seen in a long time.  Definitely a must see, if you're in pursuit of happyness or teetering on the fringes of hope.</p></body></html>

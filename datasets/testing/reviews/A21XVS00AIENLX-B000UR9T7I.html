<meta name="summary" content="Too much crying.  Why are you crying, Spiderman?"></head><body><p>Great action.  Good plot.  Cool villians.  A little more sentimentality than I expected.  There are too many tear-eyed scenes.  First Spiderman had the right blend of sentimentality, heart and action.  The second one dealt with some angst, overcoming and great action.  The third put too much sentimentality.  There are legitimate scenes that call for the tears, but the film was rank with weepy-ville.  Peter Parker is crying.  Sandman is crying.  May Jane is Crying.  Harry Osborune is crying.  Puh-lease.<br /><br />Highly entertaining but borderlining on sappy.</p></body></html>

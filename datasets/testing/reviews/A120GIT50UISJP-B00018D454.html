<meta name="summary" content="A very different take on the massacre than the original"></head><body><p>The remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre takes us back to the 1970s, shot with a nostalgia for the indie look of the original, and filled with 70s references to drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll. Five friends are driving across Texas, on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert when they meet up with a hitchhiker, a young woman who appears drugged or in shock. Minutes after getting into their car, she becomes hysterical, screaming, pleading with them not to take her back. Then she shoots herself in the head. The group tries to do the right thing, calling the sheriff to report the suicide, but in doing so, they unleash upon themselves the insane wrath of the Hewitt family. The Hewitts eat humans, turning them into some mighty fine Texas barbeque.<br /><br />Unlike the original, which shocked audiences with sudden, crude killings, the remake follows a more standard horror formula. The friends are killed off one by one, with plenty of anticipatory jump scenes and soundtrack build-up. We know when the killings will occur, and we know how they'll occur--Leatherface [Andrew Bryniarski] is back for this version. A hulk of a man who wears a mask of human skin, Leatherman wields a chainsaw and is the chief fleshwinner of the family. In this version, however, they give Leatherface a backstory, instead of leaving him an enigma. He wears the mask to hide a severe deformity, a skin condition that has eaten away at his features since he was a small boy. The fact that he chainsaws people into bite-sized pieces, however, isn't part of his trauma; that's just the family business being handed down from generation to generation.<br /><br />The whole town is ruled by Sheriff Hewitt [R. Lee Ermey]. In the original, escape seemed impossible, as all who might be a source of help are part of the conspiracy. In this version, however, there is help, in the form of a little boy named Jedediah [David Dorfman]. He's a Hewitt, too, but he's the family black sheep, having no taste for killing. With his assistance, the group (what's left of them) stand a slim chance of survival. But this family is more cunning than the original family, the characters more functional in their insanity; in the original, the family was so demented as to seem almost cartoonish. Here, they are much more capable and thus more sinister.<br /><br />Although the remake of Texas Chainsaw holds to the basic plot of the original, there are enough changes that the film has a very different feel. Add to that the fact that they use more mainstream horror conventions of foreshadowing and anticipating imminent scares, and the result is much more Hollywood than grindhouse. Which film you prefer probably depends on which tradition you prefer. If you're a grindhouse fan, the new version will seem too clean and tame; if you find grindhouse to be unnecessarily over-the-top and exploitative, you may find this version more to your liking. Take your pick.</p></body></html>

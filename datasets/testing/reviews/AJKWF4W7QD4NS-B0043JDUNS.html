<meta name="summary" content="Not a bad sequel, but can't match the first film"></head><body><p>Iron Man 2 is a fun, albeit flawed, sequel that also serves as more of a set-up for future Marvel movies.  That being said, this sequel doesn't have enough of what made the first film so much fun: action, Downey improv & banter, and a villain that doesn't get near enough screen time.  This time around, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is battling the blood poisoning that is slowly killing him, while also taking on rival industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Russian genius Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke).  Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Stark's love interest/assistant Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as James Rhodes (who dons the War Machine armor, and seems to wind up being a better acting choice as well), Scarlett Johansson joins the cast as the Black Widow, and Samuel L. Jackson returns as Nick Fury; all of which are pretty servicable, but once again, it's Downey's show, and he's loving every minute of it.  I personally dug Rourke's take on Whiplash as he proves to be the most interesting character here other than Stark, but his screen time is sadly lacking.  Still, director Jon Favreau (who has quite a bit of an expanded role here than he did the last time around as Stark's bodyguard) manages to weave a fun sequel, even if it doesn't have that same kind of magic that the first film had before it.  And of course, make sure to hang around after the credits.</p></body></html>

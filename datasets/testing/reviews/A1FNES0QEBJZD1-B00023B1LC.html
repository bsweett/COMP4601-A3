<meta name="summary" content="Bourne Identity on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>I bought this as part of the Blu Ray Trilogy package and must admit that I didn't get it from Amazon as my local Frys jumbo store had the entire trilogy on sale for 19.99 and I couldn't resist upgrading my original Bourne DVDs for the Blu Ray versions.  And what an update it is.  I felt as if I were watching it for the first time.  Rather than a boring synopsis of the plot, let's focus on the Blu Ray's quality.  The video in its 1080p with a 2.35:1 pull down does leave letterboxes bars top and bottom which doesn't bother me in the least.  Colors are clear and crisp and, most important, clean. In my opinion the video transfer is really quite good and saw not one problem with it.  The DTS-HD Audio, however, stands out as being just excellent with wide use of all the surrounds for very discreet channel usage.  Often, and especially for the rear channels, the audio on discs is more akin to the older Dolby Digital mixes where the left and right rears really produced the same audio. Not on the Bourne Identity sound mix.  Each channel was fed its own discreet audio which really made the movie more immersive for the viewer.  A fine workout is called for the sub channel as well.<br /><br />Being the first film of the trilogy, I didn't expect much from this older film but I was very wrong as both video and audio quality was superb.<br />In addition, there are no filler previews for other films or completely unnecessary extras.  And there are a ton of pertinent extras to choose from.  The alternate beginnings and endings were unfinished in post production and, therefore, their color grading and final post production results were never realized as you can see the blowout whites and artifacting in these two extra clips but they are interesting and pertinent to watch.  The other deleted scenes could all have been included in the movie as an extended version as they did not seem to me to be pointless scenes, yet their non inclusion doesn't affect the movie that is here.<br /><br />Other additional features are an interesting interview with Robert Ludlum and go back to how he got started as a writer as well as an interview with the screenwriter.  From a previous DvD release, a behind the scenes feature on some of the most captivating fight scenes you will see in any movie and how it was choreographed as well as a great many more relevant extras to boot.<br />I strongly recommend Bourne Identity as an update to your collection.<br /><br />post script.  Just noticed that the plastic cover  is stamped on the back 'Made in Mexico'.  I have no idea whether that is relevant or not but, as I said, this is an excellent blu ray dvd.</p></body></html>

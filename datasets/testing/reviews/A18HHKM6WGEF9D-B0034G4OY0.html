<meta name="summary" content="A Beautiful, Soulful, Searching Movie, But Not Your Typical Hollywood Spirituality and Happy Ending"></head><body><p>I have been trying to figure out why this film got so many bad reviews, and I think it really just comes down to subject matter. One of the characters in the movie is a journalist who has a near-death experience in the Indonesian tsunami, and then starts to probe research on near-death experiences, and comes to believe there is a conspiracy against the material getting out. I don't know if there's a conspiracy, but certainly very few people really want to contemplate death in the way this film does. It is not light and fluffy. And although it does posit the idea that there is something more for us after death, it doesn't offer an idea of what that might be. In other words, it refuses to give us a superficial, heart-warming, or comforting dogma to take home with us. It probes people's experiences with death and the other side, including in the form of a reluctant psychic played by Matt Damon, and it probes human suffering, but it doesn't necessarily give us a dimestore happy ending.<br /><br />I have to admit, after the first 20 minutes or so of the film, I wasn't sure I wanted to go on. It is sad, the characters suffer, and they are sad. But I'm so glad I continued to watch, because there is a richness and truth to what they go through, and the individual seeking they each embark upon, which brings them all together in a beautiful way in the end. I also felt the performances and special effects were all excellent.<br /><br />So no, it is not your typical feel-good movie, nor even your typical paranormal sci-fi type movie. It is a spiritual human drama, and if you are willing to stick with it, I think it is well worth the journey it takes you on.</p></body></html>

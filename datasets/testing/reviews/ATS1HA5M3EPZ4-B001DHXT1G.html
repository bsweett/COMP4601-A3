<meta name="summary" content="Good Green Movie"></head><body><p>In an effort to redo the start of a potentially good franchise, Marvel Studios offers up a great story about the one character who doesn't want the power he has.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk starts the origins over with a bit of everything thrown into the mix.  This movie is part comic book origin, part TV series origin and assumes most of the events that took place in the first movie still happened.  Bruce Banner is the brilliant scientist who experimented on himself due to the confidence in his work and converted himself into the raging green giant that becomes The Hulk.  His work was preliminary weapons research but he was not aware of it.  He was lured into thinking it was research for making soldiers more resistant to toxins and radiation, but really it was for creating a new breed of soldier.<br /><br />Ang Lee's Hulk that was released back in 2003 took a very deterred look at the Hulk and added elements of repressed anger and paternal gene splicing.  In other words, the father messed with his own DNA and passed it on to his son, who then witnessed his mother's death at the hands of his father.  Way too much existentialism added to what should have just been a man who had been given a power that came at a price.  There is enough drama and character development in the basics of Bruce Banner/Hulk that you don't need to pull in sins of the father elements to make it more complicated.<br /><br />This movie throws most of that into the trash and works with the premise that Banner (Edward Norton), now on the run, is hiding out and working to cure himself from a small town in Brazil.  He is a fugitive, which draws on the serial plot of the original TV series.  Bill Bixby's cameo is brilliant, BTW.  Once he finds out that he must travel back to the US for a potential cure, the chase is on.  Before he can pack up and start heading north, he is tracked down by General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and his squad of special forces led by Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).  They fail to capture him, but are successful at meeting The Hulk.<br /><br />Blonsky finds himself curious as to the origins of the Green monster.  When The General reveals to him that it was the result of experiments gone wrong (or right) he wants a piece of that power, which the General obliges.  As Bruce makes his way to New York, he reveals himself to Betsy Ross, the Generals daughter, whom he was in love with before the accident.  They find their way to Dr. Samual Sterns in New York for the ultimate cure and eventually the high end climax occurs.<br /><br />The best thing Marvel did here was to just make a good movie.  Too many times in Hollywood they make every movie the be-all-end-all...so how do your follow that up.  Just make a good story.  And this move does that.  It's entertaining, it's got great action and a good script.  Thank God Marvel has it's own studio to do their movies they way they should be done.  All the actors perform well; Roth is a great villian (again), while Hurt shows a deep level of deceptive character that I've never seen before.  Norton is well balanced as the brilliant scientist who wants no self pity and shows great determination to get rid of this rage driven curse.  He and Tyler have good chemistry as well.  And of course Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno make cameos along with Bill Bixby.</p></body></html>

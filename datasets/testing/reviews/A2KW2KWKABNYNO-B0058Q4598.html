<meta name="summary" content="By The End of the Movie, I Was Wanting The Aliens To Destroy The Earth"></head><body><p>At times The Day the Earth Stood Still is an interesting sci-fi, and at other times it's like shaving yourself with a cheese grater. The story is an after-thought at best, the action is few and far between, and the by the end I did not find myself attached to any of the characters, except for the fact that I liked the actors themselves i.e. Jon Hamm. But wait, SPOILER WARNING -- Jon Hamm dies for no particular reason -- SPOILERS ENDED!<br /><br />However, by far the worst element of the film is the sheer annoyingness of Kathy Bates and Jaden Smith's characters. These characters darn near ruined the film with their sheer unbelievability, irrationality, and especially in the case of the kid, the endless whining! URRGHHH! Keanu Reeves is good, but he's playing an emotionless character... Take that comment how you like.<br /><br />What do I blame this poor quality on? The lack of experience of the director/writer, whose only credits are The Exorcism of Emily Rose and The Last Castle. WTH? The studio heads entrusted such a huge movie to a director with little prior experience, and no real foreseeable talent? The result is a movie that's best reduced down to the trailer, because the movie is mostly a time waster. Why does it get two stars? Gort's the best part of the movie, and pretty darn cool... Even though he sets the end of the world in motion...<br /><br />Did I also mention that the reason humanity apparently deserves this fate in the eyes of the aliens is because we didn't take care of the environment, and the only reason we're spared is based on the promise that we'll change? Yeah, it's pretty bad.</p></body></html>

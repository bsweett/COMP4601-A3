<meta name="summary" content="Good plotline and story, but so long"></head><body><p>This film has a lot of filler that needs to hit the cutting room floor.  The tale unfolds initially disjointed, but the pieces do fall in place after a long,long time.  This is a good story about a very cold, stoic man who has a love for his country, but constrains himself so much that he looses sight of his family and personal life. There is a lot of crossing and double crossing, which is complicated, but drug out longer than it needs.  Overall, worth a viewing, and a nice change of pace for Angelina Jolee and Matt Damon, but not worth buying.</p></body></html>

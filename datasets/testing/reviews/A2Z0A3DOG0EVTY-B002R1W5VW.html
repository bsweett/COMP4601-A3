No matter how funny the prank actually is, its been played at your expense and so you laugh heartily, but inside you're pretty pissed off?  That's how I felt sitting through Ridley Scott's MATCHSTICK MAN.  A film that's so good, and yet in the end, goes one step too far.<p>The story stars Nicholas Cage (Adaptation) as Roy Waller, a con-artist with what seems like OCD.  He can't help but clean things; he a tad bit crazy that way.  His partner in crime is Frank (Sam Rockwell, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind); he's the brawn of the operation to Roy's brains.  Frank spends most of the movie setting up people, and Roy goes in for the kill.<p>When Roy runs out of his medication, he goes to a shrink to get some more.  Only to face the fact that he wishes he had a relationship with his daughter (Alison Lohman, White Oleander).  Eventually the two meet and they strike up a relationship.  Pretty soon she's in on some of Roy and Frank's con jobs.<p>MATCHSTICK MEN is a brilliantly conceived movie that refuses to remain at all conventional.  Roy and his daughter Angela have this unique and fun relationship.  It's great to watch a man fight his quirks for the people he loves.  I loved that the moment Angela shows up on Roy's doorstep that his immaculate house is dirtied and yet Roy doesn't seem bothered by it.  That's real progress.<p>Nicholas Cage does a fine job as Roy.  He walks the thin line between a real person and a cartoon so well, you sometimes forget you're looking at the guy from SNAKE EYES.  He plays these larger than life characters with so much vigor you forget he's acting.  <p>Cage is best in the small scenes in the Supermarket.  There is this beautiful women (Shelia Kelley, Nurse Betty) that Roy really loves.  They have this connection with so few words.  Like they long to spill their life stories out at each other, but they just say hi to each other and that's almost enough.  When Roy finally asks her name it's like a floodgate has open, and he is a man reborn.<p>What bugs me about this film is that I'm not sure about the ending.  It's everything I have ever wanted in a movie and yet it left me cold.  It's hard to explain why because it would ruin the movie.  But I guess it's an important lesson in the fact that "there is no such thing as a free lunch", and "what you sow, must also you reap."  <p>Now that I think of it, this film reminds me so much of the outcome of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  Of course Alex deserved what he got in the end, but don't you feel sorry about it.  Roy is not a good person, he's taken advantage of everyone who he's come into contact with, but can loving one person be enough penance for a lifetime of sins? <p>All in all Ridley Scott sets a nice light tone on what otherwise could have been a more standard gritty and dramatic picture.  His visual style is really close to Noir without the faded fedoras and the stanch seriousness.  It's definitely one of those films that will have a hard time being jammed into just one genre category, and that's okay with me.<p>Why not give MATCHSTICK MEN a look, you may be left scratching your head in the end, but at least it's a compelling ride.<p>**** out of 5</p></body></html>

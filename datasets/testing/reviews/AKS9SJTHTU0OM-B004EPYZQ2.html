<meta name="summary" content="Fun, if familiar"></head><body><p>Entertaining if derivative Steven Spielberg homage (ironically produced by Spielberg himself), ths is smarter<br />than most modern summer action movies by a long shot, with some amazing special effects, some fun shocks,<br />and good performances from a brace of young actors.<br /><br />What it doesn't have is a lot of originality, being sort of a mash up of E.T. and Close Encounters with a few<br />bits of The Goonies and old monster movies thrown in.<br /><br />It does remind us of how good those stories were, and that there's no reason you can't make a teenage friendly<br />action adventure with smarts.<br /><br />Fun and fast paced, but after the smashing (literally) opening I was hoping for more than a warm hearted,<br />well made re-tread of films gone by.</p></body></html>

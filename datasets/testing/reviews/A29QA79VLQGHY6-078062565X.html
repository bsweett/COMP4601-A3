<meta name="summary" content="Kong turned loose on DVD"></head><body><p>Ray Harryhausen never forgot the first time he saw the original "King Kong." "I haven't been the same since," the special effects wizard of "Jason and the Argonauts" and "Mysterious Island" says. "That shows how a film can change a whole life sometimes." Harryhausen figures he's watched the 1933 classic something like 175 times -- "You see something different in it every time you run it." For his 176th screening, DVD viewers are invited to listen in.<br /><br />On the DVD debut of "King Kong," Harryhausen and younger colleague Ken Ralston ("The Polar Express") spin a relaxed and often delightful commentary. At times they're experts dissecting the groundbreaking effects work; then they just seem like youngsters awed by the giant ape's sound and fury. The restored "King Kong" contains the 4 1/2 minutes that were censored as too risque or violent -- scenes such as the one in which Kong tears away some of Faye Wray's clothes. Or his size-98 foot doing the monster mash on an islander.<br /><br />The main nitrate print used for the restoration and transfer came from Britain, where "Kong" apparently roamed unmolested. The black-and-white images look sensational coming from a film that's almost 75 years old. The mono sound delivers the roars, screams and pounding drums without age-related distortion. The "Kong" DVD, with its generous suite of bonus features, completes a circle of sorts -- Criterion's laserdisc of 1985 was one of the first videos to include commentary and onscreen extras.<br /><br />The highlight, aside from the still potent 1933 film, is a chronicle of Peter Jackson's reconstruction of legendary lost "spider pit" sequence -- the missing link in the "Kong" tale. Unlike other fans, he was in the position to resurrect it -- which the director did as a side project, "purely for fun," as he started production on the new "Kong." The set's docu "RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World," is well worth the time investment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tragic tale well-told"></head><body><p>Three young boys play together on a Boston street.  As they are writing their names in some fresh cement, a man approaches them angrily, claiming to be a policeman.  He takes one of the boys away in this car and proceeds to sexually abuse him while his friends stand by helplessly.  Tim Robbins plays the grown-up version of the boy who has been abused, and Kevin Bacon becomes a police officer who is investigating the death of the 19-year-old daughter of the third friend, played by Sean Penn.  Each of these three actors is brilliant in his part and they are well-supported by Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne, and Laura Linney.  This is a classic tragedy, as high emotions, lack of communication, and exaggerated innuendoes lead to a sad conclusion.  The evil done to these boys continues to poison their lives into adulthood.  This is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed and it deserves all of the accolades it has received.</p></body></html>

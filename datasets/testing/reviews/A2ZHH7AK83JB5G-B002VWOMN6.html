<meta name="summary" content="Amadeus Is Perfectly Named"></head><body><p>I recently watched AMADEUS for the second time and was amazed by what a perfect film it is.  Totally historically accurate to the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart?  No, but the script faithfully follows the basic facts of his life and death with a heavy dose of speculation.  Tom Hulce is simply wonderful as Mozart and he believably creates a vulgar, annoying (who can forget that awful laugh?)often socially clueless little man who still fulfills the meaning of his second name "Amadeus" in being beloved by God at least in terms of musical talent.  F. Murray Abraham is perfect as Austrian Emperor Joseph's, court composer, Salieri.  Salieri possessed social skills, musical talent and training, burning ambition and at least in the beginning piousness.  It seems plausible that Salieri's realization of himself as a mediocre composer compared to the musically great though often bizarre Mozart could have driven him to obsession and madness.  The costumes and interior furnishings in the film are beautiful and the Prague filming location which stands in for Vienna fully creates the atmosphere of an 18th century European city.  Though Hulce and Abraham are the obvious acting standouts the rest of the film is very well cast.  I'm no music scholar but Mozart's music which comprises the score seems to be perfectly presented.  And the scenes from his operas are so well recreated in the original 18th century manner that they alone are reason enough to watch the film.  Yet the rich universal themes are the biggest strengths of AMADEUS.  It is a movie that can be enjoyed by those who think they hate classical music or films with historical settings.</p></body></html>

Lo and below, Rocky Balboa is back and charms his way throughout the picture. I've not had so much fun, and I love the whole package. What Sylvester Stallone brought to Rocky Balboa is the old memories and characters. At the same time, he merges his past with the present, showing no hard feelings or bitterness about how things are different and/or changed. He just has a different perspective on them, and interestingly, Rocky Balboa is old school meets new school, just a real nice fresh change for a turn. The editing work is unlike the crap I see nowadays with an interesting back-and-forth of the natural, part of the film and the fight show. I like that. Sylvester Stallone (whose best acting bit is when he gives the speech to his son before he goes back in the restaurant) is phenomenal playing Rocky again, and it's the role that he was born to play. Everybody else is great also. It's too bad not seeing Talia Shire again, but actually her death contributes a great deal to the story and makes Rocky Balboa to work. A real good asset indeed. Another thing I like about the story of Rocky Balboa is how Stallone combines the juvenile mentality of ESPN (you know, the crap about who is the best and the fictional versus thing that dominates the show instead of showing some real sports) and the need for Rocky to come back and actually fight. It makes total sense, and the fight is awesome. The best part...well, there is so many of them in the movie, but the best part is how Rocky Balboa ended. It shows how much we know that Rocky didn't care about the fight result but the actual result of winning the true fight. That display shows what is more important, and Sylvester Stallone does that admirably well. That's why I loved the movie. The feeling that I get out of Rocky Balboa is more jubilant, emotional, and refreshing than I've felt for a long time. I always think of a movie that could be made in sort of "back to the old times again" in a "where are they now?" And Sylvester Stallone does just exactly that. Mike Tyson trashing-talking with the current champion is hilarious, reminding me of the press news conference post-melee where Iron Mike yells at Lennox Lewis, "You scared coward. You ain't a man enough to **** with me." All in all, Rocky Balboa is a great, inspiring feel-good movie that is almost (I'm wincing over that rap song for Mason Dixon's entrance) completely free of anything that's improper and brings back the memories again to the point that I feel like I want to watch the whole series all over again and relive that "Gonna Fly Now" scene atop of the steps in front of the Philadelphia Art Museum (now moved back to below next to the steps). This film deserves a `10'.<br /><br />8/11: I am going to lower my rating of Rocky Balboa from `10' to `6'. To be honest with you, it's just not a very good film. Of course, it is filled with memories, but we can always watch first five pictures to relive them. So, what is the point? It is hard to for me to stomach Robert Balboa, a whelping that needs to be beaten up by Rocky to set his priorities straight. Also, it gets pretty tiresome to see Paulie making the same, usual complaints. If he is going to be like that, why should I bother to care? Then, Rocky goes into several different directions at once, letting the film to have no real clarity what the message intends to be. In short, not much really happens in the film. The most atrocious aspect of it is the camera work. Does the cameraman suffer from a bad case of arthritis? At least the fight at the end is the best part of Rocky Balboa. All in all, time for the Rocky series to die for once and all.</p></body></html>

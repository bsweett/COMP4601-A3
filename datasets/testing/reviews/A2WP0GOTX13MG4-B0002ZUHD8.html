There have been some retellings closer to the legendary fable such as 'First Knight,' and then you get ingenious spoofs such as 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail.'  What they all have in common is that they pay tribute to the elments of the legend in some respect:  the sword Excalibur, the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere, the kingdom of Camelot, the Round Table, etc.  Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of countless movies and TV shows (such as 'Pirates of the Carribean') offers a new twist on the familiar tale.  Under the direction of Antoine Fuqua, 'King Arthur' attempts to tell a story of Arthur without all the mysticism and mythology.<br /><br />Without ruining the movie, here is some basic plot information:  Arthur is the son of a Roman that married a Briton.  He has been put in command of a group of Knights that are transplants from Samatra, a kingdom far to the East in Europe that was conqured by Rome.  The Samatran Knights serve Rome in exchange for one day gaining their freedom.  Just when it looks like they are about to gain their freedom, the Saxons invade Northern Britain, and the Bishop from Rome has one last job for the Knights.<br /><br />Some of the elements of the classic Arthurian tale do still exist in this movie, including Excalibur (but it has no mystical powers), the round table, and most of Arthur's legendary knights.  Merlin even makes an appearance, but he is much less of an ally to Arthur than you might expect.  Keira Knightly plays a Guinevere that although starts off as a damsel in distress, is hardly the typical fair maiden waiting for the heroic knight to rescue her.<br /><br />While the movie purports to tell a story of Arthur that is truer to fact, it can't be taken as entirely true.  First, Lancelot appears to have been an invention of the French courts once the story of Arthur had crossed the English channel.  Yet, he still appears in the movie as Arthur's right hand man.  Ioan Gruffudd does and admirable job playing the straight forward sidekick to Clive Owen's Arthur.  Second, while the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church did suffer from a fair amount of corruption, the level displayed by each in this movie seems to be way over the top.  Third, while I commend the creators of the movie for not just dressing up Arthur's Knights in suits of shining armor, and attempting to give them a more periodic look for the Fifth Century, some of their look was just a little too modern for my taste.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, the movie does have its strengths.  The movie appears to have been well researched (although not all the things that must have turned up in that research made it into the movie).  Arthur uses Roman battle techniques against the Romans, including the use of a great deal of smoke.  While this makes it hard for the enemy to see, it frequently made it difficult for the viewer to comprehend what was happening.  To counteract this, the costume department created uniforms for the various peoples in the movies that made it fairly easy to tell who was who.  The Romans were clearly Romans decked out in their traditional roman garb and battle standards.  The Saxons had a very definite nordic look to them.  The Celts/Picts show up in lots of leather and skins and frequently paint themselves blue and grey.  The special effects work that was done to get the look of Arthur's England (out of Ireland no less) was quite impressive as well.<br /><br />The DVD contains a fair amount of extras.  There is a 'making of' featurette that I found quite interesting.  It runs about 18 minutes, but I'd like to have seen more.  The making of the movie was at least as interesting as the movie.  There is a "round table" discussion between some of the cast, director, producer, and writer of the movie.  While it does shed some insight into the movie, it seemed to fall prey to the usual pitfalls of such features:  too much of a lovefest, too much congratulatory back slapping.  The DVD also contains a diretor's commentary, a X-Box Demo for the game based on the movie, and some other features.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  It was a bit long, and the spaces between battles tended to move too slowly.  While it may be more historically accurate than other Arthur movies, it simply isn't THE definitive tale because it just can't be.  The climatic battle scene starts off a bit confusingly and is often times difficult to tell what is happening.  All that being said, it was a refreshing look at the story.  I'd recommend it to anyone that likes Arthur, movies will large scale battles, and adventure movie fans.  I'd give the movie about 3.5 stars, but after viewing the DVD extras, I fell the DVD is worth about 4.5.</p></body></html>

Mr Williams totally and entirely different from the humorous and funny man we always knew or witnessed in certain films. To be honest, the film shaked me, shocked me by throwing light on some of the dark sides of human nature. Robin Williams is extremely brilliant, very impeccable in his role. Connie Nelson does an excellent work as well, the whole cast performence is pure perfection. A very rare film you will witness on screen, a film you will never easily forget infact its likely to make you think again and again. Worth a watch.</p></body></html>

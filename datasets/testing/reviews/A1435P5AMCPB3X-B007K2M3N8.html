<meta name="summary" content="Very tasteful film about one of America's greatest artist."></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey has directed a very wonderful film about the life and times of Bobby Darin, and done it in a way that kept me interested.  At first I thougt this was going to be snore fest, but the telling of the tale with young bobby and old bobby is original, and kept my empathy and emotions into this film.  I did not know of all the adversities he had in his life, only that he died to young secondary to complications of rheumatic fever.  Bobby Darin, though he had a short life, did make a great impact into the Music industry, and left us all songs that continue to be re-played due to their creativness, and quality.  I didn't even mind the "musical/dance" interludes placed intermittantly.  This ranks right up there with Walk the Line and Ray in impact and class.  A must see movie for all music fans.</p></body></html>

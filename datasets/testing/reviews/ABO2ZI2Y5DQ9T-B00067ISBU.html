<meta name="summary" content="Very Entertaining: Good Characters and Great Ron Perlman"></head><body><p>'Hellboy' has every good element that makes a great film -- interesting characters and original visions of the world.  Though the story itself is derivative, and the special effects are no longer the greatest attraction these days (because of the flood of CGIs), 'Hellboy' still proves two things: 1) You don't need big budget to make a good film.  2) and so-called 'Stars' neither.  Nick Cage as Hellboy? Who said that?<br /><br />Anyway, the film based on Dark Horse comic book hero starts with a not-so-surprising scene in which the Nati soldiers (not again, please...) opens the portal that leads to the dark side of the world, in short, the Hell.  Their plans are disturned by the Allied troops and one Professor, but before the portal is destroyed completely, one boy comes into this side of the world -- 'Hellboy.'<br /><br />Cue to the present-day.  Now Hellboy is a hired (or kept) member of special task force in the secret department of the US government, and is fighting against the evil.  This time, however, the enemy is a bit strange, for the monster is attacking the old musuem.  The dark force that once tried to unleash the power of the Hell again stand before the hero, and his sidekick 'Abe' Sapien, who can read the past by touching.<br /><br />But the greatest part of the film is not the story, which is nothing new; it is the personality of Hellboy, who smokes cigars constantly, and speaks with a good amount of sarcasm, like a veteran cop in film noir.  And he could be also very sentimantal at times for he is in love with a lady Liz, who unwittingly emits fire all around her when enraged.<br /><br />Director Guillermo Del Toro insisted that Ron Perlman play the lead, and his choice turned out 100% right.  Perlman literally becomes the hero (with a great help from the make-up artists) and he clearly enjoys it.  So does Selma Blair as Liz, whose career so far is far from a usual one (did you see her in 'The Sweetest Thing'?)  And most of all, Del Toro knows what he is doing, and what is needed to make a good comic book hero, to whom we must relate as a credible character.  Hellboy is.<br /><br />With occasional dry humor -- see how Hellboy talks with a kid about his love, spying on Liz -- and effectively used special effects, 'Hellboy' is a film not only for comic book fans, but for general film fans.  Entertaining.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Singer honors both Reeve and Donner"></head><body><p>Superman Returns is alot like a gift from a fairweather friend.The intentions are good, but the execution is less than desired.After years of getting this project off the ground,Superman Returns marks the Man Of Steel's return after a 19 year big screen absence(as well as various TV shows ie Lois and Clark,Smallville).Bryan Singer wisely decided to pick up where Superman II(1981)left off and bring Superman into the early 21st century where most are still jaded post 9/11 and a hero like Superman seems outmoded and archaic.<br /><br /> After a five year absence seaching for the remains of Krypton,Superman (Brandon Routh) comes back to a different world where even his beloved Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) wins a Pulitzer on "Why The World Doesn't Need Superman".Meanwhile Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey paying great homage to Gene Hackman) recently paroled and rich, plans his next neferious move.<br /><br /> In Bryan Singer's hands,the movie brings the larger than life Superman to a more "human" level,as well as pay tribute to the first two Richard Donner pictures starring Christopher Reeve(Donnor's original cut of II will finally be released on DVD).Unfortunately, the film contains alot of plotholes(Lex's kryptonite waterworld,the true nature of Lois Lane's son), miscasting(Bosworth), and a downbeat ending.<br /><br /> Like Singer's first X-Men movie,it's more of a (re)introduction that promises a greater follow up.</p></body></html>

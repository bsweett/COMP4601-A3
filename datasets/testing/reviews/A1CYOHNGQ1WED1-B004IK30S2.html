<meta name="summary" content="When it's funny, its hilarious. When it's not . . ."></head><body><p>This is a scattershot comedy that ended up frustrating me. The parts that were funny, had me laughing until I couldn't breathe and the parts that didn't work had me looking at my watch waiting for them to move on. The basics are Will Ferrell plays a 70s era local news anchorman who is very popular and works and parties with his crew: weatherman, sports reporter and field reporter. Christina Applegate arrives as a beautiful young reporter trying to move in on what has been a male-only broadcast. This was a lot like a Monty Python movie in that it seemed more like a group of sketches loosely tied together to try to make a coherent movie. In this case when it works it's extremely funny and clever. But when it doesn't, it's just stupid.</p></body></html>

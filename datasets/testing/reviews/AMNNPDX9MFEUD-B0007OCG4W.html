I tend towards the latter although I didn't love it. I can, however, appreciate the many qualities the movie has.<br />Let me start by taking on the many critics who claim, with stunning arrogance, that the movie is unrealistic, or that these things never happen, or that these people are so vile that the movie isn't worth the time to watch. You couldn't be farther from the truth. First of all, the events these characters go through certainly do happen, even if comprehending such stark brutality makes you dangerously self-conscious and uncomfortable. It's one thing to dislike a movie because you found it distasteful; it's another to try to cover all of human experience with the narrow blanket made up of your own limited life and stifled imagination. Secondly, the utterly repellent nature of their actions doesn't make the movie unworthy of the time one spends watching it, even if there are terribly painful moments to endure.<br />The four characters that make up this intense drama are cold blooded, unforgiving, self-destructive, selfish, and unable to distinguish between love and her twisted counter-ego, obsession. Clive Owen is the best part of this movie, from the moment we meet him through his confrontation with Jude Law, he is a boiling, sarcastic, and ruthless mess of a man. Matter of fact, no one in this movie is very likable, even the manipulative Alice, who from her name on down to her perfectly fitting occupation, rarely plays people honestly. She tries to play herself as this wounded victim, but she has more on the ball than she's given credit for. Witness the scene at the photography studio. Roberts and Law have the far less sympathetic roles to play; and Roberts plays hers emotionally detached and self-loathingly. Law is the romantic fool who doesn't know what he wants because he is emotionally immature.<br />Closer is a movie that I would not recommend to the easily offended, the people who are uncomfortable with frank sexual discussion, or those who don't enjoy character studies with no real plot. For those of you, I'm sure there's something on Fox News Channel you'd enjoy much more than this movie. Just don't take a wrong turn and uncover Bill O'Reilly's Jenna Jameson collection.<br />I would definitely recommend it for struggling couples, those contemplating divorce, or singles who never seem to be able to make relationships work. There are plenty of lessons these tortured characters can teach and I'm guessing that you'll see some of yourself in these four and their repeated mistakes. If you want to know the hell of a relationship's demise, or see how not knowing yourself handicaps your ability to successfully love and be loved in return, put on Closer, hold your breath, and open your eyes wide.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A picaresque journey through Latin America..."></head><body><p>Before Ernesto "Che" Guevara became one of the galvanizing forces behind the Cuban Revolution, he traveled through Latin America with his best friend Alberto Granado on a beat-up old 1939 Norton 500 motorcycle nicknamed "The Mighty One." He documented these adventures in a diary and this film dramatizes some of his entries, along with Granado's memoirs, and examines some of the experiences that led to Che's political awakening.<br /><br />Walter Salles fills his movie with beautiful scenery: the green, rolling hills of Argentina and the snowy roads and fog-enshrouded mountains of Chile. At times his movie is a romanticized view of Che's early life but it also resists the urge to put him on a pedestal in favour of showing him as a young man with faults and desires just like anyone else. It does show, however, the seeds of what would result in the legendary figure he became. The Motorcycle Diaries is about two men becoming aware of the world around them and learning what it means to truly help and serve your fellow man.<br /><br />There are four deleted scenes totaling eight and half minutes. Included is a good bit where Che and Alberto try to steal wine from a dinner that they are working at only to have their stash stolen by other workers helping out.<br /><br />"A Moment with Alberto Granado" is a brief interview with the man who claims that during the course of their trip he and Che must've fallen off their motorcycle 50 times. He may be an old man now but his mind is as active as ever.<br /><br />"Making of The Motorcycle Diaries" is a 22-minute featurette that is pretty standard press kit material and relies heavily on clips from the movie.<br /><br />"A Moment with Gael Garcia Bernal" is a Telemundo interview with the young actor.<br /><br />"'Toma Uno' with Gael Garcia Bernal" is a Mun2 TV interview with Bernal where he talks briefly about his philosophy on life and acting.<br /><br />In "Music of the Road: An Interview with Composer Gustavo Santaolalla," he explains that he wrote a lot of the music before he saw any footage, relying on his reading of the script for inspiration.<br /><br />Finally, there are cast and filmmaker biographies and filmographies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WOW...incredible."></head><body><p>In the last decade, I've grown weary of going to the theater to see new movies. There is always some jerk talking on their phone, or children that are inappropriately aged for the material crying or complaining the entire time. Instead, I enjoy watching movies at home. But as with any DVD addict, you're always looking for something else. Something new to watch. That's how I found The Butterfly Effect.<br /><br />After several of my friends swore by it, I just went ahead and bought it, and am I glad I did because this will be one movie I'll watch 1,000 times over. I was completely riveted. What I loved most was that with every time he tried to change the outcome, the characters interacted differently. Ashton's goth roommate was his friend once, and then when he goes and changes his past, it's as though they were never friends. I really enjoyed that each actor had the chance to play a different version of their characters. This is an incredible and very well done movie you won't regret watching at least once, but I suspect you'll want to watch it again and again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"></head><body><p>One year after the events of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe", Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find them drawn back into Narnia.  1300 years have passed there and their former castle is in ruins.  They have been summoned by Prince Caspian (Barnes), who is in hiding from his uncle, King Miraz (Castellitto), who has marked him for death.  If the Pevensie kids can help him reclaim his throne, all the creatures of the land will be able to live in peace.  If not, Miraz will rule ruthlessly.<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" brings the Narnia series to the next level.  The effects are improved, the action is improved, and the actors seem more comfortable in their roles.  Ben Barnes, as the titular character, is average however.  He lacks enough personality to make us care about Caspian, but that is a small quibble in an otherwise entertaining film.  Director Andrew Adamson has learned from the first film and improved the finished product.  Although rated PG, it is more in line with {G-13 fare due to a load of violence.  That's not a bad thing, just a warning.  I recommend this film.</p></body></html>

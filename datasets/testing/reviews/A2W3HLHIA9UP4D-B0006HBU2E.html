<meta name="summary" content="3.75 Stars: A good action film sequel that holds it own"></head><body><p>This being the second installment of the trilogy of Bourne films, this movie is pretty much a continuation of the first film. The story takes place about 2 years after the end of the first movie, where we find Jason Bourne trying to have a life of his own, but when he subquently gets dragged back into danger, the chase is on, and Bourne is out to find his own kind of justice, and once again trying to find who he is. Of course, new characters are introduced, this time its Pam Landy (played by Joan Allen) who is trying to chase down Bourne, and new twists and turns in the story begin to unfold. Much like the first film, what makes this film the most entertaining is the pacing. There's not a lot of dull parts here, and the chase scenes are pretty good. Though there are some complaints about the shaking hand-held camera work during some these scenes, some say it makes the film more real and gritty. For me, the camera work didn't bother that much, but I could understand how some may not like it. I really don't have anything that negative to say about the film. The acting, the story, and the editing are all good. As far as being better that The Bourne Identity, well..it's close, but not quite. But if you liked the The Bourne Identity, there's really no good reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one.</p></body></html>

I suppose if you are anal- retentive, and a curmudgeon at heart, then this film will not appeal to you. However, if you want a real film about real people in hysterically funny circumstances, then you shall be pleased. Great writing and superb acting by a stand out cast make this a perfect movie to own.<br /><br />In fairness to the nudity issue: There really wasn't enough. If we're gonna sit through MC Gainey taking his clothes off, couldn't we have gotten a little more off Virginia Madsen?</p></body></html>

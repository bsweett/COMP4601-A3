The notion that psychiatrically deranged peoples are somehow possessed by evil spirits and need the blessings of a witch doctor to be healed seemed ridiculous even then.<br /><br />Apart from its preposterous theme, the film's plot is a nonsensical sequence of outdated shock images and little else.  First of all, Pazuzu is a Babylonian diety that has nothing to do with biblical lore other than the Christian Church demonizing it to make itself look saintly and paganism evil.  Even if Pazuzu were a demon, why did he choose to incarnate himself into Linda Blair: was she to be a new saint or the new Virgin Mary? These questions are never brought to light because William Peter Blatty  never had any competence to adapt a coherent plot to film in the first place.  As far as Blair's mechanical head twirling around on its motor, I've seen more convincing effects at Disneyland's Haunted House or in the Pirates of the Carribean tours.  As for the levitation tricks, one just needs to go to a David Copperfield show where they won't see dangling cables and the like.  On the bright side, Jason Miller and Max von Sydow played their roles well as the priests and Ellen Burstyn convincingly portrayed a skeptical but desperate mother.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing about the film is its portrayal of ignorant religious mumbo jumbo rituals as being an effective way of curing what are obviously serious psychiatric disorders. Perhaps the film should have also shown how religious entities successfully performed exorcisms in the past by drowning, burning at the stake, and simply torturing to death "possessed" peoples to chase the demons out: peoples such as Joan of Arc whom the Church apologetically cannonized almost five hundred years later. Indeed, we must remind ourselves of the very reliable scientific methods of the Church in exploring the mind as a spiritual vessel. Such methods were very effective in convincing countless peoples for centuries (through regular threats and acts of excommunication/ostracism, death, and/or torture of course)that the Earh was only 10,000 years old, flat, and at the center of our solar system. The movie should also show the success rates primitive societies have in curing medical conditions with similar rituals and the life expectancies of their inhabitants. With such an insight, the idea of exorcisms as cures will be the only thing to be seen as horrifying in horror films such as this one. If the power of Christ compels me to do anything with this film, it's to turn it off and throw it into the trash can where it properly belongs!</p></body></html>

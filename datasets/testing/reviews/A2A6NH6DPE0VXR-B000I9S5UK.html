<meta name="summary" content="Fishburne and Hawke make it watchable"></head><body><p>Assault on Precent 13 offers little imagination and originality. Still though I liked it for the performances by Ethan Hawke and Lawence Fishburne. Ethan Hawke plays a cop fighting inner-demons after a undercover drug bust went wrong. Lawence Fishburne plays a famous gang leader that is sent to Hawke's precent. Hawke is forced to  to team up with him when crooked cops attack the precent. They're after Fishburne because he has something on them and they don't want him to make it to trial. Other convicts played by John Leguizamo and Ja Rule are forced to team up as well. Their parts really don't matter much though and could've been played by anyone.<br /><br />  Also there are Drea de Matteo (Joey) as a secretary that dresses more like a hooker and acts more like one too. Maria Bello plays a police  psychologist that looks a little more classy. Her and Hawke have some chemestry but the movie never lets them act on it 100%. Instead through most their scenes together Hawke just accuses her to wanting to "F" him. Plus the death scenes  don't have much imagination. There's way too many scenes where people are shot in the head. Then we get a close-up of the wound with the victims eyes open. Mostly everyone that dies, dies with a gunshot to the head. Plus there's been better movies with people stuck in a building and fighting for their lives. Still though Hawke and Fishburne deliver and make it worth watching.</p></body></html>

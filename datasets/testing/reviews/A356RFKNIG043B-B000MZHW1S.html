This one takes sharp aim at the diamond industry, and comes off well. Good script, decent pacing, lots of suspense, and solid performances.<br /><br />The total diamond story has yet to be told, but this is a good start.<br />How is it that women MUST have a diamond to be wed? Aside from juvenile competitiveness with their girlfriends, it's due to a long campaign from the media to make a diamond an essential item for a married woman. Why? Money, money, money and power for those who rule the trade, and the poor nations enslaved for our greed. Just who are the overlords, what are their political connections, and what countries make billions alongside them? Do some research and find yet another tale of the first world keeping the third world enslaved in the name of petty egotism.<br /><br />This film does the service of pointing out that for every happy bride with a diamond on her finger, there is a dead child in the bush somewhere whose parents were tortured and then killed so that someone's Vegas wedding could impress the other rubes.<br /><br />It took balls to make this. Let's hope we see lots more in its vein.<br />Truth is something we need plenty more of these days.</p></body></html>

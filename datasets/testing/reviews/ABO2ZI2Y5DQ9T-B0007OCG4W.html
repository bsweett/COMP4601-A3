<meta name="summary" content="Smug and Superficial Look On Love and Relations"></head><body><p>On stage, it looks great with interesting dialogues and characters deftly manipulated; on screen, it looks so implausible and very offensive.  That's 'Closer,' film about the four characters you don't care, who keep doing horrible things to each other in the name of love.<br /><br />There's not much of a story.  This is about four characters -- played by Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen.  Jude encouners Natalie on the street of London, and they fall in love with each other, but Jude finds himself attracted to Julia during a photo session with her.  In the meanwhile, Clive also gets acquainted with Julia, and married her, but later finds she is in love with Jude, who in turn ... should I continue?<br /><br />[AWFULLY STAGY] The film is based on a stage production, and it shows.  The film repeatedly shows the beginning or the end part of the relation(s) between the characters, and when one of the  characters leaves another, their dialogues suggest what happenned to him/her before that scene.  It is not surprising that Mike Nichols, who is also known as accomplished stage director, found this material interesting.  But I for one found otherwise.<br /><br />For, on the big screen, the contrived situations as to their meeting and parting are simply impossible.  See how Clive Owen's doctor come to meet Julia Roberts.  Clive's doc is seen chatting with Jude Law over the internet.  Clive (quite ignorantly) believes Jude is a female, and makes a promise with 'her' to meet.  Ironically, Jude's prank ends up with Clive's seeing with Julia (yet a stranger to Clive, remember that), for whom poor Jude has already fell.  On stage, it works.  On screen, it's just laughable.<br /><br />Of course, you can defend the whole things saying this kind of  contrivance is necessary, and should be forgotten during the film which explores the nature of love.  Right, but the idea of love in 'Closer' means sleeping with someone else, and confessing the secret in the most off-putting way, often using many dirty and graphic words spoken by Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman, real guilty pleasure.<br /><br />OK, people act like that, I admit, and I know.  But as I remember, we are not so much intent on manipulating the relations and hurting the ones we love as those characters, whose pathetic behaviors just made me sick.  And though Natalie Portman and Clive Owen won the Golden Globe Awards, I find nothing special in their acting, and think miscast Portman is too young for the role of a striptease dancer.<br /><br />The characters are at best the puppets poorly handled by the stagy script, and the acting does not help.  'Closer' which explores the nasty side of love in the clumsiest way, is very smug, superficial, and shallow, exaggerating the obvious 'truths,' and leaving nothing behind.</p></body></html>

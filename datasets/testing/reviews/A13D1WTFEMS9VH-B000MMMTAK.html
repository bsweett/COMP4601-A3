<meta name="summary" content="I am be making 5-star review for glorious cinematic film -- not!"></head><body><p>I watched this movie with my 21-year old son, who enjoyed it a lot more than I did. While it is effective as a horror story about the profound ignorance and deep-seated prejudices of the Americans it caught 'Candid Camera'-style, this would have been better as a 5-minute skit on 'The Daily Show'. It relies far too much on toilet/gross-out bits for laughs, which in a very limited form appeals to the 15-year old in all of us. However, in a full-length movie it just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I recall watching an episode of Tom Green's old TV show wherein he was suckling the mammary gland of some bovid (!) and asking the camera, "Is this comedy?"<br /><br />No, Tom, it isn't. And neither is 'Borat'.</p></body></html>

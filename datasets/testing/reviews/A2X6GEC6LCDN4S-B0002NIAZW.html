<meta name="summary" content="Science Off, but Warning Still Very Real!!"></head><body><p>All the science was not accurate in this film, but to any intelligent person, this kind of film should urge us to think and think hard.  You have to be an ostrich living in the sand to not realize we are radically altering our environment with some chilling possibilities for weather shifts in the next couple of hundred years.  If we care about our grandchildren and great grandchildren, we should ponder the possibility that man is having an effect on his environment in subtle but dangerous ways.  The film's ending is horrible, but the fact that it is such a daring politically incorrect film, that takes guts and I applaud that.<br /><br />Mr. Bush take notice, global warming is real and it IS a threat.  Wake up!<br /><br />Great acting performance by Dennis Quaid, and being in this one should NOT hurt his career.<br /><br />Jeffrey McAndrew<br /><br />author of "Our Brown-Eyed Boy"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What happens when a violent crime is minus the violence?"></head><body><p>Denzel Washington is a detective with a mission:  a raise, a promotion, getting his name cleared in a "misplaced drug money" case, and some respect.  Nothing more... no saving the world or anything.<br /><br />In the meantime, a bank robbery begins, with multiple hostages taken, demands made, a hostage killed and hostages beaten, and rescues thwarted.  Then... the bank is stormed, and everybody comes out... except the robbers.  Where are the guns?  The explosives?  The dead hostage?  The robbers?<br /><br />Perhaps there was an inside man.<br /><br />Great excitement, with nifty twists and turns.  The one curious issue is the role, and character, of Jodie Foster as "the discrete problem fixer."  "My bite is worse than my bark," she says.  But this character never seems tough, or rough.  It is a mystery why Foster was cast for this character.<br /><br />You are never really sure who is "the inside man," or even the robbers.  I might have to see it again, and pay closer attention.  But that's okay, because it is a sponge-worthy film.</p></body></html>

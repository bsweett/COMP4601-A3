<meta name="summary" content="Whew! Redundant and looooong weak story with bad acting"></head><body><p>Back in the 1980's I thought Oliver Stone was the greatest director we'd ever seen when he released, "Platoon". He's never been able to catch lightning in a bottle again, since.<br /><br />"Alexander" is the story of Alexander the Great (Colin Farrell) and his conquests and his relationship with his mother Olympia (Angelina Jolie) and his father Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer).<br /><br />The film is ostensibly being told in flashbacks via the great scholar Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) to his students. It is an unnecessary gimmick. Hopkins does fine and the added time is arguably some of the best information that we receive in the film - BUT if the script had been better written, these scenes would not have been necessary.<br /><br />Farrell is in way over his head as the lead in this film. He can't carry the film. He neither has the talent nor the emotional range for such an historic figure. Why does Farrell use his native Irish accent (and why does the young actor who plays him as a youth do the same?)? More on this later...<br /><br />Jolie as Alexander's mother uses as bizarre Russian-esque accent that is terribly out of place with who Olympia actually was.<br /><br />Stone seems to be confused as to what direction to take the film. He gives us enormous battles of grand scale, but he doesn't take the time to let us learn about the combatants (you get face shots, but from a distance you can't tell who's who). He attempts to give us detail about Alexander's thought process regarding current and future battles/conquests, but the dialog itself is so juvenile in content that it's more like a couple of kids arguing over who's going to play cowboy and who's going to play Indian.<br /><br />We move through all of Alexander's important battles ad infinatum!! It is completely unnecessary for us to go through each and every battle in the way that Stone has us do. It is redundant and quite frankly very boring after a time. How many times can we hear that Alexander's troops are unhappy and disagree with his campaign and that they want to go home? Well, we hear it over and over. And we also get repeats of almost the same speech from Alexander...<br /><br />Alexander doesn't take spoils of war in Babylon, India or any other areas of Asia. This we are told over and over. But we are never privy to the "why". There's more action than dialogue and even though this was intended to be a BIG TENT POLE film (aka: action film), the very subject matter warrants a closer, more intelligent look than this film provides.<br /><br />Alexander was the not only Alexander the Great, but he is - to this very day - the greatest (and some would say most benevolent) conqueror to ever walk the Earth. Surely, such trite treatment is insulting to his greatness.<br /><br />I'll give a few kudos to Stone for his major inclusion of Alexander's bisexuality (it wasn't a big thing back then), but what the heck is up with that androgenous male dancer with whom he takes up late in the film? Did he cast away Hephestaion (his lover since childhood)? Is he cheating on him? It is seemly there for shock value. It makes no sense plotwise. Since Jared Leto is cast as Hephastaion, it would seem that the best material regarding Alexander and his male lover are on the cutting room floor - Leto's role is so small that it is almost cameo material.<br /><br />Rosario Dawson as Alexander's wife is very miscast. She looks about as Persian as an Eskimo. That aside, we're never really sure if she is disgusted with Alexander's relationship with Hephastaion or if it is Alexander with whom she is initially disgusted - a better set of actors might have been able to answer this question.<br /><br />Now, the accents....Jolie's Russian is totally bizarre, but let's move on. We know that it is traditional for American films to have foreign characters denoted by using English accents. If the foreign characters are villains then they typically (and insultingly) use German accents. If this is the case, then why in the world is Farrell using his native Irish for Alexander? Why not English? No one else uses the Irish accent. Here we have the accents of an immediate family: Philip (kilmer), Alexander's father: English accent; Olympia (Jolie), Alexander's mother: Russian accent; Alexander  (Farrell), Irish accent. Bizarre doesn't even begin to describe it. The poor kid who played Alexander as a young boy must have been nonplussed trying to figure out why he was delivering his dialog in an Irish accent.<br /><br />The film is sadly not worth the three hours it takes to watch it. I would really enjoy seeing a film on Alexander using a tight script, good actors, and some tight direction. "Alexander" has none of these.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Julia Roberts is great!"></head><body><p>I wasn't expecting much from this film at first, having a bad opinion of Julia Roberts's acting abilities.  However, I was pleasantly suprised to find that she infact does have talent.  The film is based on the true story of a big company contaminating the water of a town with chromium 6 and telling the residents that it was good for them.  Erin (Julia Roberts) finds out about it, and makes the company pay $334,000,000 to the residents that were affected by the contaminated water.  Roberts definately deserved the Oscar for this one.</p></body></html>

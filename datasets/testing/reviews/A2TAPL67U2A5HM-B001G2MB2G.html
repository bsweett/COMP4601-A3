<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Widescreen Edition) being the fifth film in the Harry Potter from 2007 feels quite short many times. In the novel form it is the longest book of them all; however, for some strange reason this film is also the shortest. At times it feels as if the director rushes through things and much of the sub-plot is lost. Radclife does a very good job as usual but I feel that having read the book, that the director David Yates somehow did not read the entire book, but merely nibbled at it. The music by Nicholas Hooper is not nearly as good as that of John Williams. The special effects are quite but nothing out of the ordinary. I give this movie a strong 3 out of 5. 3/5.</p></body></html>

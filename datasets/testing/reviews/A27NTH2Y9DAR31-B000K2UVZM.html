<meta name="summary" content="JAMES AND BRIAN; SAY IT AIN'T SO!!! DREADFUL DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THIS"></head><body><p>horror...I watched this...movie (?) open-mouthed, literally, waiting (in vain) for some MENTION of Elizabeth Short (remember her, gentlemen???? You did title this fiasco BLACK DAHLIA; did you not?) but instead was treated to a fight, the relationship between two cops and the girlfriend, the constant mention of Fire and Ice (big Revlon lipstick campaign in the 1950s) and an assortment of peripheral characters I was supposed to be intrigued by. Well, don't know about anyone else, but I was under the impression this movie, titled BLACK DAHLIA, was actually ABOUT THE ELIZABETH SHORT MURDER CASE.<br /><br />Was I WRONG! The most laborious, dull boring, contrived, self-centered piece of garbage I have ever suffered through. Why did I watch the whole thing? Two reasons: One, I could not believe at some point the movie would turn a corner and actually address the TITLE CHARACTER and two, I couldn't believe anything this bad actually got made and released to an unsuspecting public!!!!<br /><br />Gentlemen, you DID title this movie BLACK DAHLIA, did you not? Why, then, was she relegated to BACKGROUND for two of the dullest cops to ever come down the pike?????<br /><br />Who CARES about the cops and the g/f? At least if you have believed in truth in advertising and titled the moive (for lack of a better word) Two Cops and the Girlfriend I could have understood and would not have made the mistake of BUYING this...movie.<br /><br />I am appalled. Utter dreck from start to finish, the one semi-redeeming scene was the one with k.d. Lang (sp) singing in the lesbian palace.<br /><br />I saw a Robert Stack TV show re: Elliot Ness covering the Cleveland Torso slayings and the theory (a rather strong and credible one, BTW) that a rich society man, totally deranged, had committed these atrocities but voluntarily admitted himself to a mental health facility. Of course, he just as easily signed himself out and it was rumored traveled to Hollywood about the same time as the Dahlia slaying. After this man committed himself, the Cleveland Torso slayings abruptly stopped. Ness, famous for his inability to be corrupted, went to his grave with the name of the killer never to be revealed. (Did the family's incredible wealth buy Ness's silence this one time?) This TV show was light years more compelling and more interesting than this entire...movie.<br /><br />So blaring trumpets, sepia tints and horrendous dialogue do not a classic movie make, and this one tries hard and fails totally on ever level.<br /><br />I am embarrassed FOR the moviemakers...not one redeeming quality; not even good camp. Plan Nine from Outer Space is an Academy Award winner compared to his!<br /><br />Hopefully someday someone will come along and actually make a movie titled Black Dahlia that EXPLAINS and SHOWS the Black Dahlia instead of using the name to promote this...movie.<br /><br />It is impossible to imgaine anyone taking this fascinating subject and making such a horrible...movie, but that is exactly what happened here.<br /><br />God save us from any more collaborations between De Palma (who really should retire after this...movie) and Ellroy, who should know better.<br /><br />This atmosphere was far better realized in Chinatown and L.A. Confidential, to name two vastly superior films. The frantic "love" scene on the table was also vastly superior in The Postman Always Rings Twice with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. You could FEEL the heat in that one; this was a BAD comedy.</p></body></html>

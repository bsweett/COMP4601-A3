<meta name="summary" content="Predator is the coolest space monster around!"></head><body><p>This movie is absolutely superb! I liked Alien, but this one is even better! The fight scenes were awesome, and Arnold did a great job. Also, Predator himself was stellar and everything an big, evil  space monster should be. I thought his weapons were outstanding and  that his final fight with Arnold was the best part of the movie. And the ways he killed his victims were as juicy as roast lamb! His costume was cool, too. I especially liked the quotes "Bleed? I ain't got time to bleed!" and "You're one ugly motherf***er!" You like space monsters or science fiction? You should see this.</p></body></html>

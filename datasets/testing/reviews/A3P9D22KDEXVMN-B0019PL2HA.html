<meta name="summary" content="The Ballad of An Average Comedy"></head><body><p>I just finished wathing Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (Unrated Widescreen Edition).  I wonder if I made a mistake going with this version instead of the thaetrical release after reading reviews about some scenes not making it to this version.  To begin, I am a Will Ferrell fan.  I also like Nascar and can appreciate some good ribbing at the fans of the sport.  This movie was an example the typical average comedy that comes around many times a year.  Nothing super funny, some lame jokes, a few decent sight gags, but watchable because of the actors.  In this case, Ferrell is always fun to watch.  He was rather uneven in this movie, which is a good way to describe the movie itself.  Sacha Baron Cohen was a scene stealer in this film.  Most scenes in which he appeared were funny.  John C. Reilly was a good counterpart to Ferrell, but I guess I missed Steve Carrill as a more gifted sidekick.  The movie is worth watching for what it is.  Mindless entertainment in the tradition of other average comedies.<br /><br />Three (generous) stars.</p></body></html>

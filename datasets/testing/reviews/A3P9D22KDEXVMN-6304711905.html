Sure, that sounds like a young awe struck boy in its description of the film, but that is what it reduced me to.  Some of the best one-liners of all-time, and a great chemistry between the always solid Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer.  Kilmer is at his best as the Consumption addled (read TB) Doc Holliday.  This is a novie that I have never heard a bad thing about, even though the discussions almost always involve guys.  Really a fun and well-made film.  One of the few movies that I can watch time and time again.  A 5 star classic.  Enjoy!!!</p></body></html>

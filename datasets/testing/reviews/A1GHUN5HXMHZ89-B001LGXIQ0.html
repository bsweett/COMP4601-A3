It was way overdo time for a movie. This movie is great in my humble opinion. The casting, directing, sets, F/X, and music all make a funny type Bond movie. Steve Carell, Terence Stamp, and Alan Arkan stand out, but everyone did a great job. Carell as Agent 86 and Anne Hathaway as Agent 99 team up to stop K.A.O.S. from unleashing a nuclear bomb. Maxwell Smart has been a reliable office agent for some time and even when he passes his field agent test the Chief, played by Alan Arkan, does not want him to go to the field because of his expertise with tracking people while at C.O.N.T.R.O.L. headquarters. All-in-all a fun movie for the whole family. Fans of Saturday Night Live should definitely catch it. I give it three and a half stars. Good DVD quality and plenty of replayability. Extras are based on the single or double disc versions. If you enjoyed this catch "Galaxy Quest".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

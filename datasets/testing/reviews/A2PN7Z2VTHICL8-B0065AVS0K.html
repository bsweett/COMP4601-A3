I've never read the graphic novels, so I won't be doing a comparison to those, just a review from a happy moviegoer who loves it when style and substance meld together to form a visual treat like Sin City.<br /><br />The plot is simply mayhem and revenge, cops and criminals, in a dark world of concrete and sin.  There's lots of blood, Tarentino style, but most of it is in black-and-white so it cuts down on the squishiness.  The plot is not what you want to buy this movie for.  Buy it for the absolutely spectacular and stylized photography and visuals, and the stunning performances of the cast.<br /><br />Bruce Willis aptly and perfectly plays Hartigan, with his "Diehard-deadpan" style.  Mickey Rourke is legend in Sin City as Marv, I doubt you will recognize him at first.  The hardest, baddest, meanest, toughest, most vile criminal on the streets, and someone you can root for.<br /><br />Clive Owen (King Arthur) puts his arrogantly serious handsomeness to work as Dwight, a man not to be messed with.  Dwight's Valkyrie, Rosario Dawson (Kids, Alexander) as Gail, gives a stellar (and stimulating) performance in naughty lingerie and a deadly attitude.  Benicio Del Toro (Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, Traffic) is excellent as Jackie Boy, a bad cop with a bad heart and a bad attitude.<br /><br />Nick Stahl (Bully, Terminator 3) is awesome.  If you liked him in Bully, you will love him in Sin City as Roark Jr, later to become the golem-like yellow freak.<br />And who can ever get enough of Rutger Hauer? (Blade Runner, Flesh and Blood, Ladyhawke, The Hitcher, etc)  Not me.  I love Rutger, and as Cardinal Roark, those deadly, cold, ice-blue eyes are soulfully used.<br />Elijah Wood (LOTR, Final Destination, The Faculty) is excellent as the psychotic, creepy Kevin; a part that you can just tell Elijah had fun with.  Jessica Alba (Dark Angel) can't act, but doesn't have to in the pretty part of Nancy.  Hats off to Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile, The Scorpion King) as Manute and Devon Aoki as Miho.<br /><br />Sin City uses voice-over narration, a third party telling of the action you watch on the screen.  This movie is as good with the sound off as it is with the sound on.  Filmed mostly in black-and-white, the photography is reminiscent of Schindler's List, though 'List' used only one small splash of color and Sin City uses a bit more, the use of color is still limited to such minute and clever spatterings that the impact is still heavily felt.<br /><br />Using over-the-top violence, impossible feats of heroism, strength, agility, and prowess (Watch for Marv's driving scene and Miho's flying archery) and some very black humor, Sin City achieves a horror aficionado's Zen-like state of almost-nirvana.<br /><br />Really, forget the plot.  It's the photography, cast, acting, FX, costumes, stylization, props, and atmosphere that, alone, bring Sin City to five stars and beyond.  Sin City is a must-buy movie.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

Giger & "Alien" got a slow trickling of information about the movie release of "Prometheus". It's story, plot and origin were a complete mystery and should remain that way until you view it. The mystery surrounding the movie is as intense, mysterious and teasing as the trailer included with this review. In fact, the trailer is a fair depiction of what you will get with the film. You will get great science fiction, intense gut wrenching scenes and mysterious cave drawings that lead scientists to another world.<br /><br />Don't talk to many people who have already seen "Prometheus" before going. You don't want to know. If you enjoy great science fiction and you enjoyed the "Alien" series of movies, just go. "Prometheus" is beautiful and horrifying at the same time. It isn't for the squeamish. I will be ultra careful not to tell too much as well.<br /><br />Those familiar with the "Alien" series are also familiar with the name "Weyland Industries". They are the corporation behind the original "Alien" movies. They are the money and brains behind the operation to explore alien life forms. So when Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace (who rose to fame with the Swedish "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" movies), finds cave drawings all over earth that are similar, it leads her and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway to question our origins. Who are we and where did we come from?<br /><br />"Prometheus" is more thought provoking than action movie. Not to say that the action isn't plentiful, but the thought and development that went into the film are top notch, as well as the acting, direction and cinematography. There really isn't much to criticize about the film. "Prometheus" is pure and simple, great escapism cinema. You will be gone away for two hours to a place that will have you thinking, wondering and cringing.<br /><br />There have been a great variety of summer movies this year and Hollywood has finally learned a valuable lesson about moviegoers. We want variety. "Prometheus" is possibly one of the best science fiction movies of all time, emphasis on the science. It mixes the "Alien" genre with a great movie like "2001: A Space Odyssey". It does what every great movie should do, make you question and make you think. Go, before you hear anything more about it.</p></body></html>

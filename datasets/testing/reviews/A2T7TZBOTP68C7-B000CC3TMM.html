However, it was such a huge disappointment because of the shoddy special effects and lame fight sequences.  For example, there is a scene of a deranged model with smeared mascara, skimpy lingerie, and stillettos in a gunfight with the main character.  He protects himself from the bullets by using a standard woooden door as a shield.  Then in the next scene, she shoots ONE SHOT at a helicopter from at least fifty yards.  THE CHOPPER DISAPPEARS IN ONE PUFF - LITERALLY A PUFF - NO SMOKE OR DEBRIS.  Then there is a scene where she swings at him on a curtain, leg extended with pointy heel aimed at him.  The swing takes so much time, but he just stands there.<br /><br />Jason Statham is so gorgeous, manly, and a great martial artist, but the story was weak.</p></body></html>

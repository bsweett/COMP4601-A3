<meta name="summary" content="What a cool movie!"></head><body><p>I watched this movie with a bad attitude coming into it. I thought it would be a stupid and weird movie but when a friend brought it over, I watched it to be polite and to say it quite frankly, it rocked! Wow, was I surprised but it was some great fun and good laughs.<br /><br />The movie is about a rock star who is mad becuase he gets kicked out of his group. He then after getting a phonecall, takes a job as a substitute teacher for 5th graders. And when he learns that they can play musical instruments, he trains them to compete in a competiton where he hopes to beat his old band. The movie is quite simply fuuny and is also just really fun. You'll like all of the kids but you'll especially like Jack Black who was great. This is no brainer rent and a worthy buy as it's fuuny, interesting and really cool.</p></body></html>

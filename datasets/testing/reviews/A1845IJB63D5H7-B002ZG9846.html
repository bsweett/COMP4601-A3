<meta name="summary" content="Masterpiece fiction written by youth to fit youth and everyone else."></head><body><p>It hard to make kids write to other kids, or similarly situated folks to their peers. But Kick-Ass conveyed a real daydreaming stage of everyone's past.  An adolescent confronted with boring family situation, hormonal development, and getting to fit in a society geared for attention. A great way to get such attraction is do something about real life problems.  What else is more important to an adolescent than physical strength and security? Superman, why everyone likes Superman but no one ever tried to be one?<br /><br />The daydreaming of an adolescent to fly over physical boundaries and restore order to the tough neighborhood was not the only daydream in town.  Kick-Ass will soon find the real victim of drug crime whose daydream was fueled by a lost wife and a living drug boss for whom he wished total vengeance.  Big-Daddy and Hit-Girl will make Kick-Ass feel great about his wise choice to do good to make people safer.  Red-Mist added another layer of comedy with his sinister plot to drag Kick-Ass out of his ridiculous green suite. Red-Mist played a perfect role of a son of a ruthless drug dealer, wit, quick, but still principled and soft at heart. The dried up texture of Red-Mist and his nasal speech made him a perfect offspring of a notorious drug-pin.<br /><br />Aside from the intelligent design of the movie of playing in one of many daydreams of young people, sustained action, loyalty, betrayal, love, and growing up, the movie also expanded the horizon of physical defense to near perfection of safety to the witty and smart party.  The Hit-Girl was wired with plenty of electronic eyes and remote control to make her a robot acting with absolute immunity from getting injured.  Yet, all the genius and neat planning of Big-Daddy were foiled with trusting a geek bystander.<br /><br />The movie was tense and funny all along. Of course the people that got shot at close distances must live since it is meant to be a daydream with great humor.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another recipe from the American Melting Pot"></head><body><p>"America the melting pot" is a worn out clich&eacute;, but its tiresomeness doesn't detract from the fact that MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING is an amusing and appealing tale of the process in action.<p>Nia Vardalos wrote the play on which this film version is based, in which she stars as Toula Portokalos, the 30 year old unmarried daughter of restaurateur Gus Portokalos (Michael Constantine). Toula is a frumpy, bespectacled "seating hostess" in her father's Chicago establishment. Though the life cycle of a Greek girl is to marry a Greek boy, have lots of Greek kids, and spend her life feeding an extended Greek family, Gus is beginning to doubt Toula's ability to pull this off - particularly the first bit. Realizing she doesn't have a life, Toula connives with her mother Maria (Lainie Kazan) to land a job in her aunt's travel agency. Now, out in the real world - with the help of a cosmetic and fashion makeover - she meets and falls in love with high school teacher Ian Miller (John Corbett). Ian is decidedly not Greek. He's the only son of affluent, coldly reserved, WASP parents. The film's comedic plot revolves around the awkwardness resulting from the collision of two very different cultures during the course of Ian and Toula's BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING. For example, when the elder Millers pull up in front of the Portokalos house for an initial get-acquainted get-together, they're appalled to see the entire Portokalos clan - Toula has 27 first cousins - roasting an animal carcass in the front yard. Did I mention that the Millers are vegetarians?<p>I never felt the same affinity and sympathy for Gus and his family as I did for Lalit Verma and his family in MONSOON WEDDING, a splendid Indian film that is driven more by character development than by comic situations. Perhaps it was also because Lalit was coping with some very real predicaments, while Gus's problems are of his own mind's making. However, MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING still works because the people seem very real. Toula and Ian are attractive in a reasonable, but not intimidating, way. (This isn't a cutely tousled Meg Ryan meets a handsomely charming Tom Hanks soap opera.) Ms. Kazan is terrific as the "family neck" which can turn the obstinate "family head" (Gus) in any way that she pleases. Both movies stress the value of large-family relationships, something long forgotten by the miniscule, Nuclear Age American families of WASP heritage that strive for independence from tribal obligations.<p>Oh, and I have to believe the makers of Windex forked over some big bucks to support this film's production. Otherwise, who would've brought to our attention this stuff's amazing properties?</p></body></html>

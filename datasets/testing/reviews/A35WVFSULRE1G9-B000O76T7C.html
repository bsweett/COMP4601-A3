Dark, pulsating and quick when it needs to be. Like Hitchcock, it is more scary to see less then what you should. Jerry Goldsmiths music is penetrating and yet resourceful, you know whats going on when you hear it. A landmark film for letting the lead person be a woman, while in other horror films they fail. Sigourney kicks some serious ass in this. Singnature scene, dinner table, with the un-invited guest, unbelievable, shocking, disturbing, but we don't turn away.  No need to see the alien, the music and tenseness is as good as it gets. When we do see him, I about sh#t my pants, the best alien ever on film, period. This film is awesome, watch to the end, I promise, you will want to watch again.</p></body></html>

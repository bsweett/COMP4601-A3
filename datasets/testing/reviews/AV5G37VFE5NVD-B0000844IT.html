Surprisingly, while it was the least popular of the series in theaters, it's arguably now the biggest cult hit in the series!<br />Picking up where ED2 left off, Ash (Bruce Campbell) finds himself in 1400 A.D., taken prisoner by Arthur's knights.  Soon, he finds that the only way he can return to his own time is to retrieve the Necronomicon (a.k.a. Book of the Dead).  Of course, there are some complications: he'll also have to save his girlfriend, blow up his evil clone, and destroy an army of the dead.  Armed with those ever-so-trusty weapons, the double-barreled shotgun and chainsaw, Ash sets out on his quest to return home.<br />&quot;Army of Darkness&quot; is one of the few films that successfully blends comedy with horror.  AOD is, in fact, much more comedy than horror.  Ash is outrageous, albeit a little more pissy than in the previous films.<br />One of the interesting things to do with this film is to look back at the other two films and see how far along the ED crew came.  Bruce Campbell's acting improved by ED2, Sam Raimi became a more experienced director, the scripts changed from gore-filled horror to laugh-out-loud comedy, Joseph LoDuca went from creepy 70's horror score to booming medieval soundtrack...<br />There are two versions of the film: the original theatrical version (nicely remastered on this DVD) as well as the Director's Cut (horridly &quot;mastered&quot; on this DVD).  I would highly recommend the D.C. to the T.C., but with the quality of the D.C. on this DVD, I can understand it if you stick with the T.C.  (Woah, that was a mouthful!)<br />All in all, &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; is even more rockin' now then it was ten years ago.  Filled with bone-rattling action and groovy comedy, AOD is a film only Sam Raimi could make.<br />&quot;Shop smart, shop S-Mart!&quot;</p></body></html>

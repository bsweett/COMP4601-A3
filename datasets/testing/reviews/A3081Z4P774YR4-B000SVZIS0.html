However, I did manage to enjoy this &quot;re-imagining&quot; of one of my favorites.  In a weird way, it resembles my love of Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and it's remake in the great Western &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;.  To say it doesn't have it's problems would be wrong.  As much as I enjoyed the solid visuals and great make-up (used to great effect by the actors), I had to ask about the minor details, like the history of the humans and apes, which isn't touched on enough, in my opinion.  The ending is a little too open-ended, but at least works in leaving us as disoriented as our hero is.  It's not the remains of the Statue of Liberty, but it'll do.  The music by Danny Elfman is quite impressive, even touching upon the original's percussive score.  The 2 disc DVD set has a commentary with Elfman, as well as one by director Tim Burton, some interesting documentaries about the make-up and training for the actors playing the apes, and a lot of other material that at least elevates this up for a rental at the very least.  Despite the little complaints mentioned above, it's not that horrible of a film, and unlike some of this summer's cinematic horrors, at least it's interesting to watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Technically, the procedure IS brain damage"></head><body><p>What procedure is this?  By now you know, I'm sure.  Jim Carrey plays Joel, a quiet, reserved man who is most unsure of himself.  He is at a small lab called Lacuna, a company which specializes in removing the memories of someone you love so they don't hurt you anymore.  Joel's ex girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet) has already had the procedure performed and so Joel is there partly for spite and partly to let go of the pain.<br /><br />The movie, around 100 minutes in length, spends the majority of this time on Joel's procedure.  The lab is staffed by a main doctor (Tom Wilkenson), an assistant who does the all night erasing work (Mark Ruffalo), a pretty receptionist (Kirsten Dunst) and a kid who assists Ruffalo in the erasure (Elijah Wood).  About halfway through the erasure of Clementine from his memory, Joel decides there are some memories too good to let go of, and decides that the pain of loving and losing her is better than thinking he never knew her and he tries to abort the procedure.  This leads us into a strange journey into Joel's subconscious, where he tries to outwit the doctors he has hired to cleanse his brain of his ex girlfriend.<br /><br />The film is a brilliant idea and is very well executed.  Visually it is stunning, as Joel's memories are erased, we see his surroundings changing around him.  Charlie Kaufman, the writer, has already shown us his ability to think outside the box with his movies, with films like "Being John Malkovich" and "Adaptation".  Here, he once again takes a simple concept like love lost and takes a totally different angle on it--What if you could go back to before you ever met this person and start from scratch?<br /><br />The film actually answers this question--or it tries to.  The one weakness of the movie is that there are a couple of side plots which tie the whole story together, but are not really necessary and we don't care about them.  This is a movie about Joel and Clementine, not anyone else.  I found these other storylines, which come toward the end of the film, tiresome and distracting.<br /><br />The DVD itself is okay, but nothing superb.  There is a conversation between the French director, Michel Gondry and star Jim Carrey which is interesting, a commentary with screenwriter Kaufman and Gondry, and a brief "look" at the film with snipit interviews with the whole cast.  It's basically a long trailer of the movie.  There are 4 deleted scenes which add nothing to the story and were wisely left out, and finally a short commercial to the fictional company "Lacuna" which is funny.  The film's transfer is very good, and the sound (DTS) is great.  Overall this is a DVD you will enjoy.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

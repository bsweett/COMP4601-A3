Then, wondering why anyone would only give it one, I read those reviews.  Apparently Ron Howard really murdered the character of Max Baer and for that I reluctantly have to subtract a star.  I think he could have made just as good a film without demonizing Baer.  Braddock's opponent was not really a person, but his own past, and the circumstances of the depression.<br /><br />Well, I didn't know any of that when I saw the film so my enjoyment of it was unspoiled!  Actually I had never heard of Braddock, not being a fight fan, and I didn't even know that this was true story until the name of Baer came up, as I had heard of him.  It's the best way to see such a film cuz I didn't know how it was going to end!  Well, that's not really true, either, because just looking at the DVD cover and reading the title, you pretty much can tell the whole story.  In fact I started the film, then stopped it at the point where he broke his wrist again (ouch!) and wasn't going to see the rest.<br /><br />It was only the acting of Russell Crowe that got me to finish it.  I think he is a remarkable actor---not given enough credit.  He reminds me a lot of Richard Burton--the stocky build and that wonderful deep voice.  I think he's actually better than Burton, more on a par with Brando.  His facial expressions in this film are something to behold---the carefree playful self, loosely bobbing around the ring in victory, to the deep pain in so many of the other scenes.  The scene in which he swallows his pride and goes, begging to the dressed up swells in the boxing club, is tremendously moving.  Crowe underplays it which adds to the impact.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is wonderful, too, as Braddock's coach.  It's a stock character and could have come across as a cartoon, but Giamatti embues it with such energy that you have to love him.  This is a wonderful actor and I'm really glad to see that he's had some bigger roles and gotten such good recognition recently.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with Renee Zelwegger's performance.  As another reviewer wrote, she sounds a lot like Betty Boop in her attempt at a Jersy accent, and her facial expressions sometimes are off-putting, but mostly she holds her own with the heavyweight (in every sense of the word) Crowe and for a few moments I forgot it was Renee up there, acting, and actually saw her as Mae Braddock.<br /><br />I guess, in sum, it is a Hollywood version of reality and that has its limitations.  But once you accept that this isn't really history and can let yourself enjoy the humanity of the story, you will probably really like this film.  Another reviewer complained that we have too many tales of people overcoming terrible situations, but I submit that we don't have enough.  We all have our set of problems and seeing one person overcome his with honor and dignity is tremendously inspiring. This isn't just about a man winning a boxing match.  It's about a man whose love for his family drives him to make incredible sacrifices. It's also about the Great Depression and how this one man rallied hope for countless people who were suffering.<br /><br />For all of his possible faults as a film maker, Howard isn't afraid of genuine heartfulness and for that I greatly appreciate him.  We live in a time when cynicism is fashionable and any attempt at portraying honest human goodness is dismissed by some as hokey (read some of the one star comments) so it takes a certain courage to show this kind of story.  Obviously from reading the huge number of positive reviews, it strikes a chord with a lot of folks.</p></body></html>

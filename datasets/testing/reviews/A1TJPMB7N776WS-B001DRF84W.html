<meta name="summary" content="The Sins of The Father"></head><body><p>Ang Lee is a superlative filmmaker, responsible for some of the most unforgettable moments, scenes and films of recent memory: "The Ice Storm, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"  "Eat Drink Man Woman" and the tender and loving "Sense and Sensibility." All of these films deal with the ultra personal aspects of its characters interior lives and Lee views these things from an emotionally available perspective. He is a humanist and a respectful observer of life.<br />So it was with some surprise when I read that Lee was to direct "The Hulk," yet I knew that his approach to this genre film would be like no other and that his take on the material, though unavoidably cut from the same cloth as "Godzilla" and "Superman," would be unusual. I was not wrong.<br />Lee's humanity suffuses "The Hulk" as the basic storyline deals with the father/child relationship: Bruce Banner (a stalwart Eric Bana), his father David (A wild Nick Nolte) and Betty Ross (an otherworldly, beautiful Jennifer Connolly) and her father Ross (Sam Elliott). Ideally, parents mold and form a child through instruction and example and David literally alters Bruce's life, in a morally suspect scene, by injecting him with toxins thereby setting the course of Bruce's life and the course of the film. David, like Dr. Frankenstein wants to create a super human and thereby control a world that he feels has cast him aside...that won't recognize his genius.<br />"The Hulk" is a physically beautiful film and Lee's mise en scene cannot be faulted even when he uses the split screen to emulate the comic book genesis of the Hulk character. But ultimately "The Hulk" is not a total triumph as the two factions of the film do not quite mesh: Lee's sensibilities and the action necessary to present the physical needs of the Hulk character and the telling of his story even though there are so many gorgeous things here on which to feast the eyes: the scenes of the digital Hulk jumping about the universe that make us forget about his computer origins, the scene with the immense Hulk carrying Betty to safety that recalls King Kong and Fay Wray and Nolte's final scene in which he rages at a cruel, unfair world that brings to mind Lear raging at the sky (I Kid you not...but that's the kind of film this is).<br />"The Hulk" is a strange hybrid: a rapturously personal, monster movie. And Like Frankenstein, Dracula and even Godzilla, one that we will fondly recall in our mind's eye and in the most hidden parts of our heart for the rest of our lives.</p></body></html>

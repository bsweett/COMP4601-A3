<meta name="summary" content="Faithful film adaptation"></head><body><p>I really wanted to see this film at the theater, but I just couldn't make it happen. I guess it was for the best because I was able to see the "director's cut" on DVD with additional scenes. I usually prefer director's cuts anyway.<br /><br />Anywho, I remember reading the Watchmen comic series when it was originally released back in the mid-80s. Back then, I knew I was reading something special, so I really looked forward to seeing the movie version.<br /><br />I must say, though, that this movie would have had a much bigger impact if it had been released before the 90s when the cold war was still in full swing. The threat of nuclear war just doesn't have the sting today as it did during those days.<br /><br />On the good side, I found the film to be very faithful to the graphic novel (I haven't read it in many years, but from what I can remember, the movie follows the comic very well; almost verbatim in some areas). The story is excellently crafted and makes you think. This is not your typical superheroes-save-the-world type of plot. It's dark, it's violent and the "heroes" have some serious flaws.<br /><br />The movie is visually stunning. It is simply a pleasure to look at. The effects, costumes, music, sets, etc. are all brilliantly done and come together to craft an excellent film.<br /><br />The casting was done well, but the standout performance here seems to be Jackie Earle Haley as the "anti-hero" Rorschach. His performance can be likened to Heath Ledger's Joker from last year's "The Dark Knight". Haley steals the movie with a truly tremendous performance. He personified the charcter so completely that whenever he is on screen, you can't help but notice his truly magnificent performance.<br /><br />All in all, Watchmen is a very enjoyable film and is worth repeated viewings. Many people complained about Dr. Manhattan's anatomy being too revealing, but if you think about his detachemnt from humanity, it is very fitting. It wasn't done in a gratuitous way and was not in the slightest bit sexual. Readers of the original graphic novel will remember that there were scenes of his "anatomy" in the comic as well. Come on, people. It's just a body part. All of us dudes have them. Let's grow up a little. There were also complaints about the film's graphic violence, but I've seen worse (try "Kill Bill" if you want excessive amounts of blood and gore).<br /><br />I recommend this film, but it definitely isn't for everyone. You might want to keep the kiddies away from this one. It's for mature audiences only.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Thriller For Non-Aficionados"></head><body><p>Now, normally, I am not a fan of psychological thrillers but this one, this Swedish one, sub-titled in English, had me hooked after the first several minutes. Put together an abused, overwrought young woman (with full dragon tattoo and full psychic scars) who has seen her share of life's misery but who is also a technie whiz, a middle-aged Indy news journalist who has been set up by forces unknown (although we know it is some nefarious capitalist, Swedish variety) while just doing his usual thorough investigative job and a request to find a long missing (forty years) girl by a good Swedish capitalist "father" figure and we are off. For a land that is suppose to be something of  a" paradise" there is more social and psychological pathology here in two hours than one would find in, well, America. This is the first of Larsson's books (out of the trilogy) to hit the screen. Bring on the next one.</p></body></html>

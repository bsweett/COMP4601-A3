<meta name="summary" content="A Shrill Leftist Screed"></head><body><p>A shrill, sometimes dark, traumatizing leftist screed involving nasty religious penguins, good nonreligious younger hip-hop penguins singing about nappy hair, penguins with harems, penguins singing about wanting each others' bodies, overfishing, dementia ... this movie is not for kids. The style is semi-realistic, i.e. not very cartoonish, which was strange. You've probably seen the plot summarized already. This is not a good movie night for the whole family.</p></body></html>

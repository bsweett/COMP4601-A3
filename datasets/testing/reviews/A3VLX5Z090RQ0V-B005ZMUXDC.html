Last year's "The Princess and The Frog" may seem like a princess tale due to the title itself, but it was a princess tale based on technicalities and loopholes (which, btw, were pretty clever approaches to that movie's story); it's Disney's return to traditional animated films, but not a proper return to the golden era where marketable animated girls of royal background take center stage.  "Tangled" actually is, and this film feels very reminiscent to Disney's hand-drawn classics, even though it's computer-animated: it has a chivalric setting, vibrant scenery, a female lead who wishes for something more, a dashing hero/rebel, an evil step-mother, songs of whimsy, goofy comic-reliefs, 'dreams come true' speeches, and a valiant story filled with contrived set-ups and implausibilit---I mean, filled with magic. Not only does it capture these elements with a sense of nostalgia that will cater to the old as well as the young (fun for the whole family and all), it manage to be refreshing and bold while staying true to its roots.<br /><br />Typing from someone who has seen more than his share of fairy tale movies than he's willing to admit, this has a by-the-books story; not a lot of surprises to be had from a narrative standpoint, but then again, Disney doesn't enjoy subverting its own formula.  It has its leads, they go on a journey (trials and romance abound), and the simple audience gets what they want.  But much like "The Social Network", which is also formulaic in its story, this film manages to be very good because of its execution.<br /><br />For one thing, it's the musical numbers.  Being an animated musical, and also the first computer-animated musical made by Disney, one has to face the fallacies of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305236585">embarrassingly weak songs</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UJ9X">tacked-on musical transitions</a>; Disney movies aren't really known by them, but I can't say its characters suddenly go into song really makes sense to me.  However, Disney managed to step up its game by making the act of singing an integral part of this movie's plot.  See, the evil Gothel had to sing to a magical macguffin flower so she won't grow old, and when she kidnapped Rapuznel as a child and raise her as her own daughter due to backstory-related reasons regarding that flora of youth, Gothel made her sing so her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YHX4B0">magical hair</a> can glow and revitalize Gothel's age; since Gothel and the now-legal age Rapunzel made chirping a tune routine, their singing came naturally for them.  There was also a well-crafted musical number that took place in a saloon, where all the grunts and vikings were singing about their dreams; one of the lead characters didn't want to sing, but they threatened him to sing anyway, which made the number delightfully humorous.  If there's one musical number I thought was 'tacked on', it's the "I See the Light" sequence...and yet it's not tacked on; it's hard to explain, but maybe because the sequence itself is so enchanting, it can get away with being tacky.  For the most part, the musical sequences were excellently handled.<br /><br />Comparing to "Princess and Frog", character-wise, the leads in this film were more engaging and interesting than Tiana and Naveen.  But when it comes to villains, Gothel is pretty weak compared to the conniving Shadow Man.  While I appreciate that she treated her 'daughter' with some degree of humanity compared to other Disney step-mothers, her obsession to keep Rapunzel secluded in a tall tower for the sake of eternal youth made her appear less sinister and more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005J6RD">Joan Crawford</a>.  Back to the leads, Flynn the dashing thief has to be the smuggiest smug-face smuggers I've ever smuggin' seen this side of Dreamworks; even when he had a change of heart, found a person that's more important to him than what he stole and all that usual character development, he still had that arrogant smirk.  However, I grew to like him because he can be charismatic with his one-liners and when he does his heroic deeds later on.  There's a strong chemistry between him and Rapunzel, and there's a lot of joy to be had from those two; the funniest scene of the film happened when Flynn took Rapunzel out of her tower for the first time and she goes through a schizophrenic blast of exuberance and misery while Flynn just sulks, which was ingenious in both comic delivery and juxtaposition.  Nice that the movie took the "Aladdin" approach in having the animal sidekicks not talk but rely on physical gestures to give them personality, and I really dig the chameleon as well as the brave steed; they don't hog much of the screen time, but that's a good thing.<br /><br />I'm amazed at how the Disney princess archetype has evolved over the years.  The likes of Snow White and Cinderella don't have much in the way of multi-layered personalities outside of being kind and pretty (or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VAR0T8">Belldandy</a>), and it's only until "The Little Mermaid" that princesses started to have some depth to them; although, the deepest some can go is being assertive and independent, pretty much the 'woman in a man's world' mentality that grew to succession in reality.  And then comes Rapunzel, a proper evolution to the stereotype.  She's such an amazing character, because she has that dainty innocence as the old princesses as well as the defiant attitude of new princesses; it all says she's a woman in heart and body, but can still hold her ground, which is more than I can say about many tough action girls.  Rapunzel also has some unique quirks to give her distinction, like her hyperactivity; she's practically a child, going bananas at all the new things she sees or wanted to see.  The fact that her life was explored from the beginning made me understand her, made her compelling as she journeys not only to know her past, but to maturity.  No doubt she's right up there with Jasmine as one of the best Disney princesses.<br /><br />Again, "Tangled" is following a familiar tale, but such familiarity comes with great characters, a solid adventure that's clever and exciting, moments of levity and grim, and a resolution that, while not quite as good in the same manner as "Wall-E", is so moving that it's worth suspending one's predictions.  The songs themselves are very moving; each song is catchy, energetic, and easily inviting.  These compliments come as no surprise since Alan Menken composed for this movie, who also wrote music for most of the Disney Renaissance films and had a history of turning sappy love ballads into diamonds.  Speaking of, "I See the Light" is personally the highlight of the soundtrack, a sublimity that owes much from "A Whole New World". I really like this song and I can't wait to see the accolades it deserves, and I can't wait for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B58D08">America</a> to try and ruin it in a few years; good thing I have a frying pan to beat myself senseless when the latter happens.</p></body></html>

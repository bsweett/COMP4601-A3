<meta name="summary" content="A fun, scary, and chilling experience!!!"></head><body><p>There was a time when horror films were fun, scary, and exciting. Lately, they have lost their edge, becoming nothing more than horrendous parodies of themselves-- greenlit by money-hungry producers looking to make a quick buck. Horror films used to cause excitement amongst moviegoers. Now, whenever a horror flick is released, it quickly gets lost in the crowd of comedies and quasi star-vehicles. Frequently ignored at the mainstream box-office but made so cheaply, these films more often than not make a profit, inspiring countless unnecessary sequels, keeping those suited tyrants smiling all the way to the bank. <p>Just in time for Halloween, a handful of horror films were released. Amongst them was "The Ring," an American remake of a 1998 Japanese hit, adapted by "Arlington Road" and "Scream 3" scribe Ehren Kruger. Here is a fine example of a modern horror film that actually thrills, and proof that strong word of mouth can greatly benefit a good film not expected to do as well. Not only is this one of the best horror films ever made, it is also one of the few remakes that actually fare better than the original.<br /><br />"The Ring" is a surprisingly effective and subtle horror film that, through genuine wit and intelligence, stands out amongst the computer-generated messes that pass for Hollywood's current attempt at horror. It's a surprisingly dark film that stands in nihilistic contrast to the feel-good, life-affirming style of horror typified by The Sixth Sense and its many imitations.<br /><br />"The Ring" sets up its central premise with admirable speed and clarity. Supposedly, there's an urban legend about a mysterious, unmarked video tape that somehow causes the death, seven days later, of anyone unlucky enough to watch it. One unfortunate viewer is the niece of neurotic reporter and single mother Naomi Watts. While investigating her niece's death, Watts has the misfortune of watching the tape herself. The premise is beautifully set up in a simple opening scene that uses a ringing telephone and the image of a static-filled TV screen, as well as a pulse-pounding musical score, to whip up a sudden crescendo of tension.<br /><br />Director Gore Verbinski's (The Mexican) visualization of what is on that tape has to be counted as one of the film's major triumphs. He is to be commended for not taking the easy route of filling the screen with explicit but meaningless "shock" images: instead, he creates a creepy collage of surreal but recognizable pictures. They have the disturbing power to get under the viewer's skin with such skill that it creates a feeling of continually growing dread which doesn't become obvious until it's already too late to escape.<br /><br />Having watched the tape, Watts soon receives a phone call informing her that she (and apparently, the film's audience) now has precisely seven days left to live. Refreshingly, Watts goes against American horror film convention by neither ignoring the threat or attempting to escape in the stupidest, most illogical way possible. Instead, she immediately sets about to figure out what the tape means and how she can prevent her own seemingly inevitable demise. Aiding her in this endeavor are her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) and her disconcertingly Haley Joel Osmentish son (wonderfully played by David Dorfman in a very creepy performance).<br /><br />This is the rare Hollywood horror film that actually respects its audience's intelligence enough not to have its heroine freaked out by finding a stray cat wandering around the pantry. Instead, Verbinski gets his scares by filming an off-center vision of a world that is recognizably our own. He has the patience to create a subtle atmosphere that prays not on our immediate impulses, but on the usually hidden fears that lurk within us all--the knowledge that at any moment, our life could end for reasons we'll never know.<br /><br />In horror films, the less you know, the scarier things are. Verbinski understands that the camera creates tension just by moving; he builds anticipation and suspense about what could be lurking just outside the frame, while rarely revealing what it might be. The look of fear so clearly expressed by his characters is always more chilling than any monster he might turn his camera on. Perhaps Verbinski's greatest accomplishment is when the film's main horror finally does make itself visible after dominating the viewer's imagination, it still manages to be as frightening as anything we could have visualized in our mind's eye. Yes, I was absolutely terrified!<br /><br />Though this film is obviously designed to showcase the skills of its director, one cannot ignore how much of the film's success comes from Naomi Watts' performance as a very untypical horror heroine. Playing her role with an unstable neurotic streak, Watts manages to make her character endearing, frustrating and, most importantly, real. In a time when so many horror films tend to present women as either cute survivors or victims born only to be exploited and punished, Watts gives us a recognizable human being who, though understandably terrified, displays welcome strength and determination, giving the film a needed boost of reality.<br /><br />"The Ring" is a handsomely mounted, intelligently crafted thriller that skillfully maintains a tense sense of dread. The crisp editing, fluid camera work, meticulous production design, menacing score and gloomy Pacific Northwest locations all contribute to the unsettling atmosphere, as does Verbinski's decision to use primal horror imagery, rather than gore and cheap scare tactics, to unnerve us.<br /><br />Verbinski and company have crafted an exemplary thriller, and maybe one of the year's best films. I have not seen a thriller as disturbing and satisfying since the likes of Richard Kelly's "Donnie Darko" or Alejandro Amenabar's "The Others."  "The Ring" is a true masterpiece of modern horror, which is wonderful considering Hollywood hasn't pumped out any consistently good edge-of-your-seat films in quite some time. Maybe "The Ring" will help change this. One can only hope.</p></body></html>

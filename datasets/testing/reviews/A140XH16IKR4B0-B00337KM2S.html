<meta name="summary" content="Flying high"></head><body><p>A perfect story of the high-flying life led by Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) who is a corporate hatchet man, responsible for making sure that employee terminations go nice and smoothly. For all the brutality of his role, Bingham has found a way to give fired workers the dignity they need to leave their old, familiar jobs. For this talent, he is highly prized...and compensated. His lofty lifestyle is laid out wonderfully - he wears the finest suits, he knows the best restaurants, hotels and credit cards, and commands the best service. When, on one of his trips, he meets Vera Farmiga (Alex Goran) whose passion and knowledge of the good life matches his own, it seems like a match made in the heavens.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about "Up in the Air" is that it doesn't follow any of the clich&eacute;d plotlines that could have emerge from this situation. For one thing, Clooney is saddled with a rcent business school grad who wants to replace him with a computerized script. The tension between technologized youth and wisdom and humanity is priceless and timely. It's hard to discuss the movie without giving the story away. Suffice it to say that nothing is what it seems, and turbulence is a certainty. A very fine film that plays to Clooney's roguish persona, "Up in the Air" is full of humor, wit, high passion, a glimpse in to the high life and genuine pathos.</p></body></html>

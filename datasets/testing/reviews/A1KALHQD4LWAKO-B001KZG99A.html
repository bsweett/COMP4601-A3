<meta name="summary" content="Suprisingly delightful!"></head><body><p>Here's a movie that:  moves briskly, has a bit of humor, and is a beautifully-made and thrilling cinematic ride.  The special effects left me smiling.  There aren't any "stoopid" female roles (e.g., the women don't end up falling [as they run away from an evil man], getting caught, or becoming hostages that force Iron Man to make those humanity-vs-love-interest choices); instead, the main female character is smart, funny, and savvy.  Refreshing.  There's a few plot surprises, too.<br /><br />This is a smartly made/directed, fun, and entertaining action movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

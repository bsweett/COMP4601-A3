It is hard to believe this gem is 70 years old! The restoration is nothing short of incredible and there are tons of worthwhile extras too! I'm glad to see nothing was censored in this film! This is the way to treat all the Disney animated classics, completely restored and unedited with lots of extras. Come on Disney! Haven't we given you enough of our money!? Please stop editing these historical pieces and give them the treatment they deserve. If you must edit them, then release them both ways. One for the poor kiddie's parents who can't deal with some "PC" stereotypes and one for the purist who want to keep things they way they were meant to be seen!</p></body></html>

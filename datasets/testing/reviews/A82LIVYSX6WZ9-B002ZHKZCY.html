When his girlfriend, played by Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), gets killed, he takes matters into his own hands and hunts down the people who want him and who are responsible for her death. Twists and excellent action scenes take this one to the max. Paul Greengrass knows how to create a good actioner and yes we all know the books are better but give it a rest will ya, this is a great ride. Joan Allen (The Contender, The Crucible), Brian Cox (Troy, Adaptation), Marton Cskostas (Triple X), Julia Stiles (Down To You, Save The Last Dance) and Karl Urban (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Ghost Ship) are among the great cast. Urban plays the evil assassin who killed Damon's woman. Favorite scene would be the last action scene with Damon and Urban in the cool car chase scene. This is one Damon fans wont be dissapointed with. Hey at least he's having a better career then Ben Affleck..anyway I recommend you go see it, it's better then Van Helsing. There's shades of Chris Cooper (Adaptation, Seabiscuit) in this movie</p></body></html>

What about that scene in which Renee Zellweger listens to the radio blow by blow account of her husband's fight with Max Baer?  I haven't seen such wounded, assaulted innocence since Richard Barthlemess menaced Lillian Gish in DW Griffith's BROKEN BLOSSOMS.  Zellweger's face is photographed in such shadow (lensed through what seems to be a hole in the basement) that pretty much all you see is her dark tearful eyes and her pasty white hand covering her mouth in horror.  The radio reports another blow to Russell Crowe, and her eyes bulge out even further.<br /><br />I say the sheer dowdiness of her outfits is a sort of sentimentality.  OK, I know it's supposed to be the Depression.<br /><br />How about the scene where all the poor Catholic people of Bergen are gathered in the church to pray for Braddock's success against Max Baer?  The priest drags in an enormous radio, the kind that mimics the shape of a cathedral, and turns it on fullblast between the chancel and the nave, and the congregation smiles in bliss.  Later, when the fight increases in savagery, the priest is seen in silhouette, pretending he's Braddock, going one two with his upper left like he's attacking an invisble punching bag.  This is the equivalent of cutting to a dog to show the dog's amazed reaction.  It's supposed to be cute.  Back in the day, directors used to cut to little RON HOWARD's face to cue us about how we're supposed to feel.  Now he turns the tables, the real Cinderella Man.<br /><br />The movie is a little thin, and could have used a subplot perhaps to distract us from its inevitably grand progression.  There was that one subplot about Mike Wilson, the fiery socialist who tried to organize Hooverville, but I don't think one person in the audience was interested in him or his plight, do you?  Maybe the actor playing him wasn't talented enough, but I think the fault lay really in not developing the story very much.  Ken Loach might have told it well, not Ron Howard.</p></body></html>

His previous two films "Pi" and "Requiem for a Dream" rank as top favorites for many cinephiles and are even more impressive when you realize how low-budget they are. Yet those films contain many haunting images and some innovative camera work. Give Aronofsky a budget and some big-name actors, you get "The Fountain." This film has haunting images, a haunting score, good performances, and is one of the most beautiful films I've seen. Too bad, it lacks that brilliance in plot. The film stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz as two lovers over the course of 2000+ years. First Jackman is a conquistador of Spain who is sent by the Queen (Weisz) to find the tree of life. Then, in the year 2000, Jackman is an animal surgeon whose wife Izzi (Weisz) is dying of cancer. He has samples of the tree of life and he's used them on monkeys to great success, but it may be to late to test it on his wife. Then there's the final segment, the one that transcends explanation. The only thing I can tell you about it is that Jackman is bald and Weisz is a tree. Plot-wise, this is Aronofsky's weakest film...Visually, it's his strongest. Even with a modest budget he was able to produce fantastic visuals (the visuals are one of the reasons few people forget "Requiem for a Dream" when they see it), but here he outdoes himself. I'm about to start ranting, so prepare yourselves. Aronofsky had an actual budget now, which gave him a certain level of artistic freedom. This film is absolutely, unequivally visually arresting. It's a film that is incredibly beautiful to look at, even if you're not entirely sure what it is that you're looking at. The final scenes will keep your eyes glued to the screen, whether you've enjoyed the rest of the movie or not. The performances are good, Jackman gives an under-praised performance here. He puts a chameleon act on the film and manages to brilliant disappear behind each version of the character he's playing. Weisz looks stunning, but her character(s) are one-dimensional and thefroe hard to really feel for. "The Fountain" has had a mixed reception from critics, but on a purely visual level it deserves 5 stars. Since I actually paid attention the weak plot and one-dimensional Weisz character, it gets less. However, if you open your mind and just let the images take over than you'll find a very haunting experience awaits you. The film co-stars Ellen Burstyn ('Requiem for a Dream') and Ethan Suplee ('My Name is Earl').<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></body></html>

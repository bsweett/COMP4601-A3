<meta name="summary" content="Breezily sweet"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Keri Russell is cute and spunky and Nathan Fillion is adorably awkward as the object of her affection, so it's rather a shame when the movie falls back on dumb stock characters like Keri Russell's selfish pig of a husband (ever notice how many attractive, smart, and nice women in movies are dating complete jerks?) and doesn't try for anything greater than a fairly standard, albeit rather successful, romantic comedy formula; ultimately Waitress is as sweet as the pie the plot focuses on, but not very filling.<br /><br />2.5/4</p></body></html>

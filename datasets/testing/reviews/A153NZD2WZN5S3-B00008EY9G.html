<meta name="summary" content="Ghostly Court"></head><body><p>In reminiscence to Hitchcock's classic, a film tells of ten strangers staked and murdered at a motel, but presents an emphasis on mental conditions meeting something supernatural.<br /><br />I think combining weird with earthy is not a too clever attempt itself, adding a kind of round table court proceedings surely.<br /><br />What is realistic it is a completely inappropriate court order which reflects movie-makers own civic expertise probably.</p></body></html>

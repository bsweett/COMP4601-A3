<meta name="summary" content="Not a Supreme movie"></head><body><p>I understand that this movie was "based" on groups like The Supremes and it was not intended to be a bio, but still I was disappointed at how little The Dreams resembled their inspiration. Yes, the glamour was there, but the music, which was fine, did not evoke The Supremes or even Motown.<br /><br />Beyonce, as Deena, plays the role of lead singer Diana Ross, but her role, both as a character and as a singer, is surprisingly weak in this film. Jennifer Hudson, as Effie, is supposed to represent Florence Ballard, and it is her character and singing that drive the movie. Effie's brother C.C. is the songwriter for the group, cranking out one hit after another.<br /><br />I didn't see the stage version of Dreamgirls. In the movie I felt confused about the firing and subsequent alienation of Effie. Deena began sleeping with Effie's fiance, Curtis (Jamie Foxx), the group's manager. Effie was missing rehearsals, arriving late, and "making trouble" due to "medical problems" (we find out later that she was pregnant by Curtis), so the entire group, who called themselves a "family," fires Effie and pretty much tell her to get lost. For the next five years or so, while The Dreams go on to great success, Effie is a single mom on welfare, and not even Effie's brother knows that she has a kid. Then, when Effie suddenly comes back into the music scene, her brother tells her that he has written a sure-fire hit song for her that only she can sing, as if the last five cruel years hadn't happened! And suddenly all the bad things that happened to Effie were the fault of Curtis, not anyone else. What? During the final song, with Effie joining The Dreams once again, there is an odd scene with Curtis standing in the aisle staring, perplexed, at the daughter he didn't know he had. Likewise I felt confused about the character of Curtis. I know that larger-than-life people can be complex and both good and bad, but in this movie it was hard to figure out which was which. Near the end of the movie Curtis steals a song that he has no reason to steal, and then he is blackmailed into giving it back. Very strange!<br /><br />The nicest surprise of this film, and the character who most evoked Motown, was Eddie Murphy as the irrepressible soul singer Jimmy Early. I felt another brief and funny nostalgic moment during a glimpse of a Jackson Five-like group. Sometimes this film went into operatic mode, with sung dialogue and arguments, which I enjoyed.</p></body></html>

There is an advert for a movie called "Friday the 13th." It depicted a drawing of some anxious-looking teens standing in a group in front of a lonely cabin, surrounded by sinster woods, with a moon-silvered lake in the background. Superimposed over this was the silhouette of an adrogynous figure holding a knife. The caption read: "They were warned. They are doomed. And on Friday the 13th, nothing can save them."<br /><br />Of course I had no idea that this "disposable" low-budget horror flick would make a mountain of dough and be exploited mercilessly in an endless parade of increasingly formulaic and stupid sequels. Neither did star Betsy Palmer, who said of her decision to take the role as Mrs. Voorhees: "I didn't like the script, I didn't understand the movie and I thought the whole thing was crap, but I needed a new car. Plus I figured no one would ever see it." My own first experience with the series came five years later when I saw "Part V: A New Beginning", which begs the question of why the hell I ever watched the rest of them. I must say I'm glad I did, because otherwise I wouldn't have caught this immortal slasher classic.<br /><br />"Friday" is the story of a man named Steve Christie who is attempting to start up a summer camp for inner-city kids in a remote place called Crystal Lake. Christie is what you would call obsessed with this idea, and proceeds despite the evil history of the place (a double murder 20 years before and a long series of incidents since) as well as warnings from a local nutjob named Crazy Ralph, who blathers on about a "Death Curse" that hangs over the area. [this constinutes the 'THEY WERE WARNED' part of the advertisement, and Ralph should have heeded it: he gets a barbed-wire neck massage in "Part II"]<br /><br />Enter a group of nubile twentysomethings who are the camp staff. [THEY ARE DOOMED] These kids unwittingly go about camp business, which seems mainly to involve smoking pot, drinking beer, and premarital sex (can I go to this camp?) while they are stalked and viciously murdered one-by-one by an unseen killer (on second thought, never mind). Plucky actress Adrienne King stumbles on the identity of the axe, knife, & arrow-wielding psycho a bit too late to get any help from co-stars like a young Kevin Bacon, who himself discovers a might too late that the someone under his bed ain't the tooth fairy. [ON FRIDAY THE 13TH NOTHING CAN SAVE THEM]<br /><br />There was, of course, not much original (even in 1980) with this Ten Little Indians" approach. And there are a few moments of "horror-movie stupidity" which are so glaring that you aren't even sorry to see the victims get theirs. For example, towards the end of the film, the two surviving characters, not having noticed that everyone is dead, go into a friend's cabin. She is gone, and in her bed in a bloodstained axe. When they go back outside, they finally discover everyone else is missing and the car has been disabled. At this point many would be alarmed into, say, caution. The guy says: "I'm sure there's a perfectly rational explantion for all of this!" Of course there is, dumbass, it's that there's a killer on the loose! Then the power is cut, whereupon this blockhead volunteers to go to the spooky power shed by himself in the dark....and the girl lets him. (Possibly she wanted him to "distract" the killer while she got away.) Furthermore, the number of times Adrienne King beats down Betsy Palmer and has her helpless, only to then run away and let her get back up again, gave me the feel that the scriptwriter might have worked for pro wrestling before he turned his pen to horror. Honey, JUST FINISH HER OFF.<br /><br />Stuff like this could have derailed the movie. What made it work was the little things: 1) The music. Nobody who has ever heard "ch-ch-ch, ha-ha-ha" can ever forget it. 2) The cinematography. Especially brilliant use was made of characters emerging slowly, at a great distance, from complete darkness (and later, in the running-away scenes, of them submerging into it, as if sinking into the depths of a black lake: incredibly creepy and effective). 3) The inventiveness of the murders: in "Part VI" there is a scene, actually two scenes, where Jason simply kicks in a door and murders the woman behind it. That type of thing fortunately doesn't happen here (just ask Kevin Bacon).<br /><br />"Friday" isn't like its successors. There's no Jason (excactly), no hockey mask, and the body count is a very modest half-dozen, two of which are offscreen. The identity of the killer itself is hidden until the very end. If the whole "pot/beer/sex = death" formula seems incredibly hackneyed nonetheless, it always helps to remember that this was one of the films that wrote it.</p></body></html>

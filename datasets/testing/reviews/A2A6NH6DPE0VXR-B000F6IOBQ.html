<meta name="summary" content="Kate Beckinsale in leather 2!"></head><body><p>Part 1 never did much for me. About the only good thing I can say about it is that it has Kate Beckinsale in leather. Here she's in leather and I think she gives a better performance. She looks incredibly hot and I like the story more and there's also more action. Her relationship between her Scott Speedman's character develops more as well. I don't know why so many people give this one a low rating and talk about part 1 like it's all that. I had a lot more fun watching this one than I did with the first movie. I like the main villian that has bat wings although it's never really explained how he got like that. We just know that he's a half-breed that's trying to free his very strong werewolf brother from his hidden prison cell.</p></body></html>

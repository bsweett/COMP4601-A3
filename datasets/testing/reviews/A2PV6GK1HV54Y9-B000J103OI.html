Streep has never played such a feisty, fearless, and bitchy character! And by the way honey, a size 6 is not fat (thank you very much!) Hathway brings vunerability and strength to her character, Blunt is hilarious as well as she tries to dodge unwanted criticism from Miranda (Streep).  The Devil Wears Prada can be mean at times but the somwewhat sappy ending makes up for it. Great fashion, clever story, and an outstanding cast is what you'll get from this summer blockbuster. Have fun!</p></body></html>

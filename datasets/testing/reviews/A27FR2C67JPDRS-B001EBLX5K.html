Its not politically correct but it is VERY FUNNY.<br /><br />Borat, a reporter from his native land of Kazakhstan, is sent, along with his short, chubby producer Azamat, to the U. S. to explore American culture.<br /><br />In New York, after watching an episode of "Baywatch", Borat falls for Pamela Anderson and decides he must cross the country to find his beloved lifeguard in California.  Along the way, Borat encounters dozens of people with various and hilarious outcomes.  Whether its a nude wrestling match between Azamat and Borat, hitching a ride with racist and sexist frat boys or his "marriage" attempt with Anderson, you are bound to bust a gut at some point in this film.<br /><br />Finally, don't skip on the deleted scenes.  There are six of them and all of them (other than the "cheese" one) are very funny too.  Borat's trip to the animal shelter and massage therapist are priceless.<br /><br />If you are easily offended, you many not want to view this film.  Otherwise, give it a go and you are guaranteed some laughs!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Affecting performance by Paltrow"></head><body><p>John Madden, who directed Shakespeare in Love (1998), and David Auburn, who wrote the script (adapted from his play), have put together a moving story about mathematical genius admixed with mental instability much in the manner of the life of John Nash who was the subject of A Beautiful Mind (2001).<br /><br />Nash was a paranoid schizophrenic who was tormented by voices in his head warning him of dangers and conspiracies that didn't exist.  Like Nash, Robert (Anthony Hopkins) is a brilliant mathematician who, having done spectacular work in his early twenties, goes crazy.  Unlike Nash he is never able to regain control of "the machinery," as he calls his mind, and is never able to do any worthwhile work again.<br /><br />Or is he?  As he is taken care of by his mathematically astute daughter, Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow in a most affecting and beguiling performance) he fills scores of notebooks with intense writings.  At one point he seems in remission and at another point Catherine rushes home to find him in out in the backyard in the middle of a snowy night fired with enthusiasm about his latest work.  At another point, he and Catherine work together on a project.  And herein lies the crux of the matter.  As we discover, this project turns out to be a proof of a difficult mathematical theorem or conjecture that will be internationally celebrated if it is correct.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Hal, one of Robert's students who is going through his mentor's papers in the hope of discovering something wonderful.  Catherine tells him that among the 103 notebooks that her father filled during his days of mental instability there is not a single one that has anything of value in it.  But when Hal wins her heart she produces a notebook that was locked away in a drawer.  It turns out that this notebook contains that most amazing proof mentioned above.  And it is here that Catherine says--in line that is so very well set up that her expression fairly takes your breath away--"I wrote it."<br /><br />Well, did she or didn't she?  Because the work seems to be in her father's handwriting and seems to be well beyond her abilities, her sister Claire, played in that clever but somewhat annoying style that Hope Davis has so perfected (About Schmidt; American Splendor), claims that Catherine is deluded and couldn't have written it.  To Catherine's grievous disappointment Hal reluctantly agrees, and this seeming lack of faith in her sends Catherine toward the precipice of insanity.  This is the key question of the plot.  Who wrote the proof?  Its resolution will be the denouement of the story.<br /><br />Clearly Claire believes that Catherine is so like her father that she is about to go crazy herself.  So she tells Catherine she wants to sell the house now that their father is dead and bring Catherine to New York where she lives so that she can take care of her.<br /><br />Will Catherine go or will she trust her heart and begin a life with Hal?<br /><br />This movie does not play well with some audiences I think because the wonderment that some of the characters feel--the absolute awe that transfigures them when they behold a great mathematical proof, is not entirely appreciated by the average person.  Madden makes sure that Catherine, Hal and one of the mathematicians form on their faces an expression something akin to a religious enthrallment when they understand the thrilling logic of the proof.  I suspect that for many viewers something was lost in the translation.  Consequently, although many others, including myself, believe this to be one of the outstanding movies of 2005 it only rates a 7.0 at IMDb and was not nominated for any Academy Awards.  Paltrow won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance in Shakespeare in Love, also directed by Madden (he seems to bring out the best in her), and that award was richly deserved.  But here in Proof I believe she was every bit as good (in a different way) although she was only nominated for a Golden Globe award and did not win.<br /><br />Another thing about this movie is that it is strangely affecting emotionally.  You might find yourself misting up a bit as you watch.  I know I did.<br /><br />See this for Gwyneth Paltrow, a gifted actress giving one of her best performances, and for John Madden, a director who makes beautiful movies with style and finesse.</p></body></html>

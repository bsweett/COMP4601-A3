Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young man in what he believes to be a very difficult situation - his father, Frank Abagnale, Sr. (Christopher Walken), is in trouble with the IRS and, as a result, his mother, Paula Abagnale (Nathalie Baye), is having an affair and wants a divorce.  Unable to handle the stress and not wanting to deal with the situation, Frank Jr. runs away from home.  <p>Unable to find a real job that will pay him what he needs, he turns to crime, but a type of crime that has some early roots in lessons learned by his father.  His crime spree begins as he realizes he can write people bad checks and get away with it.  However, the bad check scam only works for so long before people catch on.  Frank Jr. learns this rather quickly and, instead of continuing to write bad checks, turns to creating phony checks and cashing them at unwitting banks, realizing he can get away with it for much longer.  <p>His success at forging checks brings him to the attention of the FBI and their check fraud specialist, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  It is only through Carl's persistence that Frank Jr. is eventually caught, but not before Frank Jr. can try his hand at several other ploys.<p>Building on his deceptiveness in the check forging scam, Frank learns that people very seldom actually check your references and as long as you look the part, they are willing to let you play it.  Frank takes advantage of this fact by getting a Pan-Am pilot's uniform and flying millions of free miles in the jumpseat of airplanes.  Once he becomes aware that Pan-Am is catching on he leaves the pilot business and forges the necessary credentials to become an emergency room supervising doctor that only requires him to make sure the residents under him take care of everything.  This job is short-lived however, and he trades it in for a job as a lawyer when he falls in love with a successful, New Orleans attorney's (Martin Sheen) daughter, Brenda Strong (Amy Adams (III)).<p>He actually tries to adopt this life permanently, but his past catches up to him and eventually he has to flee to Europe to escape Carl, but to no avail.  Despite being caught after a multi-million dollar and several year crime spree, Carl eventually devises a plan to get Frank out of jail early and put him to work in the check fraud division at the FBI, where Frank Jr. eventually builds a very successful career.<p>My Comments:<br />I thought I was going to have a problem with this movie in the very beginning when Leonardo DiCaprio's name was before Tom Hanks's name in the opening credits, but I quickly realized that it was justifiable - this is not a Tom Hanks movie, it is a DiCaprio movie to the core and very good one at that.<p>If the movie wasn't based on a true story (though embellished no doubt), it would fall into the absolutely unbelievable category of movies and I probably would not have given it as as good of a rating as I did.  Throughout the movie my wife and I were incredulous that something like this could actually have happened.  I haven't done enough research to actually discover what was real and what was embellished, but even if one-tenth of what happened in the movie was real this is still a fascinating story.  Of course, as with most movies where you are rooting for the criminal, it does kind of turn the tables on justice, but because this one is a real story where the criminal not only was caught but then turned around and began meting out justice to other criminals, you feel justified in rooting for him.  Also, despite any embellishments, the story was very solid - there were virtually no plot holes and very few if any gratuitous or wasted scenes.  This is a very tight movie.<p>As for the acting, I think I am going to finally have to break down and give Leonardo DiCaprio some credit.  I also recently watched Gangs of New York and this guy has got it going right - he can play a very convincing number of roles.  DiCaprio was superb, hands down superb.  Also, the supporting cast, including Tom Hanks, were also very good.  There were only a few major names in the movie besides DiCaprio and Hanks, but major names weren't really necessary.  For the most part the acting in this film was very convincing.<p>The only thing I might criticize about the movie was the opening credits.  They seemed wasted on silly animations that could have been used to introduce characters and cut down on the the movie time (this is a pretty long movie).<br />This criticism carries over to the DVD menu structure because it uses a similar type of animation that is actually kind of difficult to read.  Other than this wasteful and silly decision, the movie was great.<p>Overall, this is a wonderful movie.  The acting is very convincing and the story is impeccable.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this film.  It draws you in and stuns you with every twist and turn.  I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

The entire film is mesmerizing and captivating from the opening to final shot. This is David Lean's masterpiece.<br /><br />The performances of this film's cast are impressive. Omar Sharif gives probably the performance of his career as Sherif Ali. He is so natural and convincing in this role. Alec Guinness shows his talent for perfectly emulating the requirements of his role as Prince Feisal. Alec Guinness proves his worth as an actor's actor giving another conniving performance here. Claude Rains is excellent as the very wry Mr. Dryden. Arthur Kennedy as Jackson Bentley just shows us how good an actor he really was. He made it look so easy. Arthur Kennedy's legacy has been greatly overlooked.<br /><br />Maurice Jarre's score is a true classic evoking images that are eternally grained into our memories.</p></body></html>

It is a very simple to follow story about a boy who's father is of major importance in the time of Vikings. Yet Hiccup does not inherit the strong burly momentum that his father does. So instead of going up against his tribes enemies, the dragons he is sent to work as the lowest of the low in the fight, until he decided to accidentially trap one of the rarest of the rare. When his father finds out he did he is proclaimed a hero and when he finds his catch he tries to do something none of his tribe has ever done...learn to befriend it and understand it. What Hiccup uncovers is a major secret in the world of Dragons and that there is a way to put a stop to years and years of rivalry.<br /><br />This movie will make you laugh and make you feel true emotions as it portrays a classic Father Son tale. The cast is amazing from the leading role played by Jay Barruchel all the way to Craig Ferrgeson. Dreamworks, while they don't always create a gem like Pixar tends to do, comes up strong with this one. It is a great movie and you will definitely enjoy it.</p></body></html>

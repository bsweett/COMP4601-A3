<meta name="summary" content="Do yourself a favor: Watch the original!"></head><body><p>Let me make this clear: This film is good, but the original (Swedish version) is GREAT! I would highly recommend the original ("L?t den r&auml;tte komma in"; US translation <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAC">Let The Right One In</a>), directed by Tomas Alfredson, over this remake. The original delves more into the supporting characters whereas this focuses mainly on the boy (Smit-McPhee) and girl (Moretz), but still doesn't quite catch what the original does. Nevertheless, Moretz shines in this film and with her roles lately (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG983M">Kick-Ass</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97F6">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XUG">(500) Days of Summer</a>), she's proving to be quite the young actress! This film proves that she can do drama with the best of 'em! Reeves does great with the directing but the screenwriting adaptation is something to be desired. Like I said, if you haven't seen the original and you're not up to reading subtitles in the original, then this will do. Otherwise, I highly recommend the original. Nevertheless, a great horror film that is more suspense thriller but still gives a good uneasy feeling.</p></body></html>

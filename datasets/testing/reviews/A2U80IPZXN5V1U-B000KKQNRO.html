<meta name="summary" content="The Da Vinci Code"></head><body><p>INTRO:The Da Vinci Code was released as a book in 2003 and has been getting more and famous as time went on,now 3 years latter its made in a movie in 2006.What makes it so controversial is the book is basicly about religion and what the church tried to hind from you and stuff ,its all fiction but its a good book/movie.<br /><br />Sure some will find this movie outrageous because this is contradicting what they beleved for all their lives and the media attention The Da Vinci Code is getting will make that many people will see it and many disagree.But you got to keep in mind thats its fiction.Its controversial because its about religion and religion is something that nobody can handle because we all have our toughts and people think differently from you.<br /><br />For the movie itself now:The Da Vinci Code supports the idea of the the holy grail and that Jesus maried Mary Magdalene it is why its getting that much attention.The movie is about enigmas all along they have to solve to get to the next one.The movies is basicly around the death of Jacque Sauniere(got shot in the chest and had minutes to live) who is a well known cryptologist and when he died in the louvre museum he left ennigmas that would lead them to their quest of the holy grail.Robert Langdon teams up with Sophie Neveu(Jacque Sauniere is her grandfather)to decode what Sauniere has been tring to tell in the last minutes of his life.<br /><br />I read the book and i liked it i had expectations from this movie and it did well.The movie is 2 hours and 28 minutes and its long enough they putted as much as they could from the book cutting the less interresting stuff.Many who read the book tought it would be better as a movie.The action is a bit slow but Langdon and Neveu often get chased by the police and try to run away.<br /><br />There are different languages used in the movie and i saw the movie in english but there was a lot of french during the movie and those who dont understand french might find it frustrating cause you have to look at subtitles to understand at times.<br /><br />The movie can be very comfusing If you hadnt read the book it might be hard to understand,if you read the book then you should see the movie its worth seeing.</p></body></html>

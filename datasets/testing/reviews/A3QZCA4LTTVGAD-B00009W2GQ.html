<meta name="summary" content="The continuation of an epic sci-fi saga"></head><body><p>&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; continues the story begun in the original &quot;Matrix&quot; film.  Once again Keanu Reeves plays cybermessiah Neo, who fights to defend humanity against an enslaving machine collective.<p>&quot;Revolutions&quot; effectively expands upon the compelling mythology established in the original film, as the freedom fighters continue to move between the gritty real world and a complex virtual reality construct.  Much of the film is a relentless orgy of violence and explosions--at times it's just too much and becomes exhausting.  Nevertheless, there are a number of genuinely thrilling and inventive action/fight scenes.  There are also some memorable visual images.<p>At its worst &quot;Revolutions&quot; can be bombastic, obscure, pretentious, and even corny.  The film is at its best when it remains in touch with the essential humanity of its characters.  Reeves anchors the eclectic, multiethnic ensemble cast with his earnest, understated performance.</p></body></html>

My local movie critic considered this the best film of 2007 and I truly must agree with him. While it's not like we haven't seen the story of the pregnant teenage girl before, it's been awhile since we have seen it done with so much grace, humor, and heart and fantastic characters that earn your care.<br /><br />From the beginning involving a chair to the ending involving another chair, "Juno" moves effortlessly along in a simple-yet-gorgeous way that lets you view Juno's life as she sees it. No, it's not hand-held camera, but it might as well have been the lovable Juno directing.<br /><br />What really makes this show work is its wonderful cast of characters. Juno is the crowning star, but it is not like the others did not pull their weight. Jennifer Garner takes her sweetness from "13 Going on 30" and channels it into an adult yuppy. Jason Bateman is relatable, even when it's painful. Michael Cera pulls off a heartwarming performance. Allison Janney almost stole the movie. And it wasn't just stellar performances. These are wonderfully written characters, all fully realized and unique and proud to be so as they deal with this very serious situation of teenage pregnancy.<br /><br />This movie deserves all ten stars and all the praise it has received. It is well-made. It is well-written. It is well-acted. It has a great message. It finally has a teenage girl stepping up to take responsibility, even in a society that frowns upon adoption. I went through every emotion, from tears-inducing laughter to tears-inducing heartbreak.</p></body></html>

They are KGB agents,  lead by a bob-wearing, rapier wielding villainess. They open the trunk of their car, and voila, Indiana Jones and his friend are inside. Together, the villains force Indiana to locate a mysterious relic that they think will give the Russians advantage in the cold war.<br /><br />Soon Indiana is embroiled in a mystery that takes him to South America after the mysterious "Crystal" Skull. Joined by a greaser named Mud and his Harley Davidson motorbike<br /><br />I felt this film had some potential and it 'almost' worked' for me, but at times it was just plain silly and jumped the shark. Mud swinging through the trees hanging from vines like Tarzan, the giant ants, and, worst of all, the scene with the refrigerator, and the Indians who seem to have nothing better to do other than to hang out in graveyards, and hide in ancient tombs... Yeah right.  It watched like a video game, and unlike the first few films... I never really got the sense that Jones and his family were ever in jeopardy. Wherever something didn't make sense, or lacked direction, the screenwriter seemed to just throw in an action scene. It was just... Well... A bit silly.<br /><br />This was a rather obvious, predictable film that the kids might enjoy. While I didn't hate it, I didn't love it either. 3 stars.</p></body></html>

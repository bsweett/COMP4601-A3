<meta name="summary" content="What if someone told you that your child never existed?"></head><body><p>Well, I see the other reviews are all over the place on this flick.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is about a mother's love for her child.  She refuses to let go of his memory when others try to tell her he never existed.<br /><br />The movie opens with Telley Paretta (Julianne Moore) on a swing, thinking.  Later, as she goes through her son's photos, belongings, and home movie clips, you hear Telley talking with her Psychiatrist (Gary Sinise--aka Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump) about the loss of her 9 year old son, Sam, 14 ? months ago.  It seems several children boarded a plane and there was a plane accident.  Husband James Paretta (Anthony Edwards) seems supportive.  She has regular sessions with the Psychiatrist.  Telley is forgetting little things here and there, but we all do that.  Then, photos of Sam disappear, as do home movies.  Sam even disappears from family photos, as if he never existed.  All traces of him are gone. Telley blames her husband for getting rid of the memories, but then the Psychiatrist explains she never had a son, but a miscarriage.  He says her mind made it all up.  While James is present, the doctor threatens to hospitalize Telley (for her own good, of course).<br /><br />Knowing this is all a lie, and realizing they are all against her, Telley takes off on the run.  She goes to a male acquaintance who also lost his daughter on the same flight.  All of a sudden, the FBI and the National Security Agency are involved.  The local police detective also realizes this just doesn't make sense.  The movie is pretty fast paced and action packed.  It's an "on the run" type move that takes place in New York, while the two grieving parents search for the truth.</p></body></html>

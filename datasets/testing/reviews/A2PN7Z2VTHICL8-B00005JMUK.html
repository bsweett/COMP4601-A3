<meta name="summary" content="Charlize Theron's performance will blow your socks off"></head><body><p>Monster is based on the true story of female serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a common prostitute that left a string of dead Johns in her wake.  Aileen (Lee) is on the verge of taking her own life when she meets up with Selby, a lesbian who is looking for companionship.  Selby gets Lee to talk, and they agree to meet again the next night.  Lee needs money, so she takes to the streets to make some cash.<br /><br />Her last John brutally beats and rapes her, and in an act of (what seemed to be) self-defense, Lee shoots him to save her own life.  Selby and Lee hit it off and decide to set up house together, each having their own ideal of what 'a real life' should entail.  While Lee believes that giving up hooking and finding a real job is the key to her new life, Selby is too dependent to go out and get herself a job, therefore remaining reliant on Lee's income as a prostitute.  Life does not stay peachy for the new lovers, and after many heart-breaking rejections from the job market, Lee returns to hooking in order to feed her and Selby.<br /><br />Whether Lee had simply had enough of prostitution, or whether the last brutal John soured her, or simply the idea that she had gotten away with it once, Lee adds a new twist to her hooking schema; murder.<br /><br />Monster is not a fast paced story of the police investigation hurdling towards finding a killer, but the horrifically commonplace lives of two women who want more out of life but can't seem to find their way out of the trenches.  It didn't strike me as 'what would you do for love' type of story either, simply a deviant's twisted mentality of right and wrong.  It is a story of the human inside the animal, even a human as alien as Lee was, and the presentation those animals will make to remain human as long as they can.<br /><br />Get ready to see the performance of a lifetime from previously uncelebrated actress Charlize Theron.  She *should* have won the award for her amazing performance in Monster, never again will you see her as a 'blah' or 'so-so' actress.  She immersed herself so deeply into the role that she became almost unrecognizable as the Charlize you have seen before.  The talk, the walk, the mannerisms, are all portrayed with a natural flow, you simply will not believe how good she is in this movie.<br /><br />Special mentions go out to Christina Ricci (Selby) and Bruce Dern (Thomas) for their stellar performances also.  Director Patty Jenkins receives a tip from my hat also, for finding the human inside Aileen Wuornos and bringing it to the screen.  In the featurette, Patty mentions that Lee's behavior wasn't about strength or weakness, but about damage, and she managed to highlight this in the film.<br /><br />I'm not usually a big fan of Special Features, but you absolutely MUST watch the featurette, where it shows the work behind the scenes and how they transformed Charlize Theron into Aileen Wuornos.  It's not just seeing the make up applied, but watching her mannerisms change as she imbeds herself into the role.<br /><br />Monster is a superb movie, an emotional killer, which will leave you full of both pity and rage at what becomes of those who society turns their polite cheek away from.  I highly recommend Monster as a 'buy' rather than 'rent' DVD.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

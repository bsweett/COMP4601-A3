<meta name="summary" content="Ugghhhh.. Horrible"></head><body><p>We have decided to only rate Amazon movies from now on that are either GREAT on one extreme or HORRIBLE on the other.<br /><br />Brothers Grimm had a great premise, great sets, etc...<br /><br />The ingredients seemed right but the movie was OH SO PAINFUL AND ANNOYING TO WATCH..... very deadpan humor, stiff acting, silly Jerry Lewis slapstick comedy..... just overall a dreadfully painful movie experience to sit thru.<br /><br />My wife and the guests we had over for movie night all agreed this movie got a "D" on the normal grading scale.</p></body></html>

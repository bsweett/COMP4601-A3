It has it's sad and even depressing moments but it's still uplifting and touching. How many movies do we get about living life to the fullest ? The answer is simply, not enough. Sure we all aren't rich like Nicholson's character so we all can't see the world before we die. But the movies heart is in the right place and it's well acted with gorgeous locations.<br /><br />  I think the problem is that critics have just gotten too used to handing Rob Reiner movies one star and this one didn't deserve it at all. Nicholson and Freeman both have charm and the movie has some too. Maybe there's something wrong with me, I didn't see the Davinci Code as being that bad either lol. But I liked this movie and am ready to stick up for it if I have to.</p></body></html>

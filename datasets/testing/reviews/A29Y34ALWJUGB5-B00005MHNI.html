<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's Best"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick, one of the legendary directors, is also the easiest to misunderstand, I think. His movies range in genre but generally follow his usual oddball style, and many find this style unsavory, even me. In fact, many of his movies, especially his newer ones, I have no care for. But to me, his three greatest films are some of the best ever. Those films are The Shining, Full-Metal Jacket, and this, A Clockwork Orange, which I think is his greatest.<br /><br />The story of Clockwork follows a young hoodlum named Alex as he goes about his days beating and raping people, bullying his friends, and drinking drug-laced milk. But when he goes too far and accidentally kills someone, things take the expected turn and he ends up getting caught by the police. After spending some time in prison, Alex gets word of an experimental new rehabilitation program, one that guarantees him a chance to get out of prison within two short weeks. He doesn't realize, however, what this treatment entails, believing only that it's his chance to get out or prison and back to his old life. And so begins the rehabilitation of Alex, and when released fourteen days later, he's a new man incapable of doing violence, having sex, or even listening to the Beethoven's Ninth.<br /><br />What drives this movie is easily the character of Alex, a kind of an amoral Peter Pan of sorts, a boy who doesn't want to grow up, locked in a world of ultra-violence that he rules without exception. He's intelligent and manipulative to the point of genius. He's fun-loving, singing and dancing while dishing out pain and torment. Yet, though we should hate this anti-hero, he's just so damn easy to cheer for, especially during the early moments, which are as shocking as they are exciting.<br /><br />I will say that A Clockwork Orange, like 2001, has the capability of being misunderstood, and could easily be considered Kubrick's worst film. It's a movie that takes a certain amount of stomach to withstand, because it places an emphasis on torture, full body nudity, and desensitized youth, and attempts to disturb the viewer constantly. But, even if you think this movie is bad, you can't help but realize that it's at least unique. No movie has ever been made like this, and it's been thirty-five years since its original release. If you haven't seen this movie, pick it up, especially if you are a fan of gory horror movies, apocalyptic sc-fi films, or adult Japanese anime, as all of these types of movies share some of the themes of A Clockwork Orange.</p></body></html>

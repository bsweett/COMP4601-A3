I read some bad reviews of it online, but wanted to give the movie a chance.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage plays a character that can see 2 minutes into the future, which is certainly a superhuman ability.  You can imagine many of the scenarios that might unfold through use of this ability, but the movie manages to keep it fresh and interesting.  I think the subtleties of his ability and actions are portrayed very well.  He is quite the smooth operator, and plenty cool.  There is a lot of action in this movie, and it is exciting from the start.  I also liked the fact that love enhances his ability, and liked Jessica Biel as his love interest.  If there was a flaw in this movie, it would be the ending, which left something to the imagination... a bit too much to the imagination by some people's standards.  However it doesn't ruin the movie in my opinion.  I only buy movies that I really like and want to see again many times.  This is one of those movies.  Check it out!</p></body></html>

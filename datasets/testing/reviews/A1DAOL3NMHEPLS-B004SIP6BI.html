It's all SO well-intended and politically correct, and the story is barely believable. (How did this woman who shows up in town on foot, with only two suitcases, manage to equip and stock a confectionery store?)  I enjoyed it while it lasted, even though I felt that the movie was trying to manipulate my emotions, but it left no lasting impression. Enjoy it for what it is --- a (semi) modern-day fantasy or fable -- but don't expect greatness. It's not as good as most reviewers would have you believe!</p></body></html>

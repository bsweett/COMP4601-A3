<meta name="summary" content="Recall Recall Recall"></head><body><p>What a good movie!  This is everything a Schwarzenegger movie is supposed to be.  It is fun.  It is exciting.  It actually is though provoking.  It has a plot, and a good one at that.  The Austrian Oak plays Doulas Quaid, a man not quite happy here on earth.  And while he can't afford a vacation there, he has heard things about a business called &quot;recall.&quot;  This is where the movie gets interesting.  Recall can program memories into your head.  While Quaid is getting his dream vacation, something goes terribly wrong.  He ends up going to Mars anyway, and there are now questions about his identity, what his actual mission is, and about his life in general.  What is made up?  What is real?  Will he ever know?  It makes for a very exciting movie.<p>This DVD looks awesome.  The case is cutting edge, using a Mars cutout on top (the size of a DVD).  The special features look great, too, including commentary by Arnold himself.  This is a must buy.</p></body></html>

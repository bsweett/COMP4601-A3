<meta name="summary" content="The role of the Saudi colonel with a heart kept this film from being formulaic"></head><body><p>This film seemed interesting because it was set in Saudi Arabia and plays to the paranoia that most Americans have about the Middle East.  Jamie Fox, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are cast as FBI agents who are sent on a mission to discover who, exactly, attacked the American compound, killing innocent family members of oil executives.  Naturally they encounter obstacles as they get little cooperation from the Saudi government with the exception of a colonel, played by Ashraf Barhom, a family man himself with a sense of integrity and who really does his best to help the Americans.  That's the premise.<br /><br />The film is full of those long chase and shoot-em-up scenes that are required in a modern geopolitical thriller such as this.  Perhaps they would have been more impressive in a theater, but they lose their effectiveness on a regular TV screen and I was soon bored with them.  The acting was adequate and what can be expected in a film like this but the most impressive performance was that of the Saudi Colonel whose humanity kept the film from falling into a formulaic good-guy - bad guy format.<br /><br />Filmed in Arizona, the film did its best to recreate what Americans tend to think of as the Middle East. But why, then, was Jennifer Garner allowed to run around in bare arms and a bulletproof vest when while all other females in the cast were covered from head to toe in black burkhas?<br /><br />I really shouldn't be reviewing this film because I'm just not into this type of a flick.  I therefore give it a mild recommendation as an action film set in an unusual location.  It didn't seem genuine to me but I know I'm not the target audience.</p></body></html>

Patton, arguably America's greatest Second World War combat general.  Based on two books about Patton ("Patton: Ordeal and Triumph" by Ladislas Farago and "A Soldier's Story" by General Omar Bradley), the movie explores the war within his soul, and the temperament that was his undoing and yet brought him unprecedented success. Limited to his military career between early 1943 and late 1945, it's more of a character study than a biography.  But with a running time close to three hours, it's a character study with tremendous depth.<p>Several aspects of his character are highlighted.<br />1. Patton was fiercely competitive.  His race to beat British Field Marshall Montgomery to Messina and then to Berlin becomes a prime motivator for success, even if he needs to sacrifice men to achieve his personal ambitions.<br />2. Patton loved war and thrived on the heat of battle.  While his compatriot General Omar Bradley did his job because he was trained to do it, Patton did it because he loved it. "I love it, God help me, I do love it more than my life." Patton had no political ambitions, and his only fear was that the war would have no role for him: "All I want to do is command an army in combat." As his German opposites observed, "The absence of war will kill him."<br />3. Patton was a passionate military historian.  His love for military battles of the past constantly becomes evident: "Patton is a 16th century man, a romantic warrior lost in contemporary times."<br />4. Patton was intensely religious.  He believed in both God and reincarnation, and was convinced that the lines of history were in place for him to achieve great things, and that God would enable him to fulfil his destiny - "The last great opportunity of a lifetime and I'm left out of it? God will not allow it to happen."  Yet his fierce religious fervour towards God was juxtaposed by his profanity towards men.  He frequently blasphemed, one incident in particular bringing out these conflicting qualities, when in reply to a question about the regularity of his Bible reading, Patton remarks "Every God-damned day."  It's been said that the raw language typical of Patton is even toned down in the movie (he supposedly once said "You can't train a platoon without using profanity").  Yet his inclination toward profanity is not excused, but is presented as part of a larger problem he had in controlling his tongue.<br />5. Patton was inspirational.  He knew it was natural for soldiers to fear battle, and combated this with a fierce military discipline that made the soldiers fear him instead.  "They'll lose their fear of the Germans ... I hope to God they never lose their fear of me."  "I won't have cowards in my army."  The inspiring and bloodthirsty monologue that opens the movie with Patton dwarfed by the American flag is unforgettable: "No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country."<br />6. Patton himself lacked the discipline he expected of his soldiers.  His moments of lax self-control led him to say and do things that got him into serious trouble with both his superiors and allies.<p>These last aspects are especially important.  The movie almost has the aura of a convincing documentary, because it paints Patton with his virtues and vices. This is one of the movie's strengths: it portrays Patton as he was, with both strengths and weaknesses, without openly glorifying or condemning them.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner stated in 1970 "We are not defending General Patton, and we are not attacking General Patton.  We are really telling the true story of one of the most fabulous and interesting characters that I have ever observed in action."  More than anything else, it's a serious study of his complex character.  This war within the man overshadows the war outside the man.  Patton was his own worst enemy, his big mouth frequently getting him into trouble, and resulting in him being relieved from his command on more than one occasion. Great as he was, he was not without weaknesses, but his failings are shown without excusing them.  In fact, Patton's weaknesses were the reason Eisenhower opted to advance General Omar Bradley ahead of Patton, although Patton was always his first choice when a brash military leader on the field was needed for a particularly bold mission. Despite his weaknesses, Patton was truly inspirational to those who served beneath him and the importance of his contribution to the Allied success is undeniable. <p>At times the story goes beyond the man, with a broader focus on the war effort.  First Patton and Montgomery vie for success against Rommel in Sicily, and then again in Europe.  But the war scenes are always on a large scale, with wide angle shots of explosions, tanks and masses of infantry, rather than individual experiences of horror.  In the end, it is not the world war that is center stage, but the complex character of the man Patton, and the war between his passions.  George C. Scott's performance as Patton is brilliant and one of the memorable performances in cinema.  It's not surprising that the movie went on to win seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  It has that epic "Lawrence of Arabia" feel, and it serves of a lasting testament to the confusing personality of a strange yet important military leader: Patton himself. -GODLY GADFLY</p></body></html>

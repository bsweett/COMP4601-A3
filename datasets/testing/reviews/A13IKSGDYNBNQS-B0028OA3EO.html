It loses another star for the frequent and painfully obvious use of CGI and if I was being unkind it would lose more for its over sentimental and sugary styling. How much music with heavenily choirs and strings are we expected to take?<br /><br />I wasn't especially impressed by Brandon Routh, who was clearly copying the Christopher Reeve formula but he was wooden by comparison. The best by far was Kevin Spacey, but he wasn't given a lot to do. The films I've seen that have been directed by Bryan Singer have in general been very good, for me this is his first failure.<br /><br />By all means buy it, if you can get it very cheap, but its not worth spending much on!</p></body></html>

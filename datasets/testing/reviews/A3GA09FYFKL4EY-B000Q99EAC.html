<meta name="summary" content="Rocky's Redemption"></head><body><p>"Rocky Balboa" saves itself and is good enough to make up for the horrid 4 and 5. The story goes back to its roots....that the championship is in the journey, not winning the title itself.<br /><br />Rocky's now a widower, having lost Adrian to cancer, and has a shaky relationship with his son. He's living a quiet life in retirement, but still feels that he has something left to prove to himself. He gets his chance and another bout in the ring with Mason Dixon.<br /><br />Like the original Rocky, this time it's more about a spiritual journey than the sport. Some of us have come of age along with the series, and it's great to see Our Hero go back to his roots.</p></body></html>

I think that it's overhyped, and that it tries to hard to capture the viewer's attention, which is ironic, since the film has a exceedingly thin plot. Garden State's non-existing plot and direction by Zach Braff allows us to follow a guy we hardly know anything about as he re-connects with his high school friends and an eccentric girl he met at a clinic, who he winds up falling in love with. The film attempts to stand on it's own feet with the cast's performances and the script's dialogue alone, but ultimately, it falls over. The ending of the film is completely cliched. The fact that high school kids think it's so "deep" baffles me. It's as if they're attempting to read between lines that aren't there. The problem with disliking "Garden State" is that when you express your opinion, the emo kids and fans of the film claim that "you don't get it". I understand what the film is about, it's just that I didn't like the film.</p></body></html>

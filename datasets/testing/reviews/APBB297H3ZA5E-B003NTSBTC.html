I know the end of the movie is just a small percentage of the film, but... it's the end;  it obviously brings the whole film together and thus it was a huge let down / dissapointment when at the end (well, you'll have to watch it... or just perhaps skip this film).  Other than the end, which makes the entire film illogical, the writing / acting was excellent.  But again, once you're done with the film, you'll be asking yourself "what's the point of the film?"</p></body></html>

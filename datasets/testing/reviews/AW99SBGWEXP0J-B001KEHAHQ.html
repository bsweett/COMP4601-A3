<meta name="summary" content="The Pink Panther"></head><body><p>The coach of the French national soccer team is murdered on the field after the game, and someone steals his ring.  The ring contains the Pink Panther diamond, a large and valuable pink diamond.  Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kline) decides to put an idiot in charge of the investigation so he can swoop in and solve the crime and gain all the glory.  This idiot is Inspector Clouseau (Martin).  Of course, Clouseau may just be dumb enough to solve the case in spite of himself.<br /><br />This is a movie that probably did not need to be made.  The character of Inspector Clouseau is so entwined with Peter Sellers that anyone taking on the role has his work cut out for him.  Steve Martin is not up to the task, but he does not completely fail either.  He does an ok job filling his predacessor's shoe, and does bring some laughs.  Kevin Kline and Jean Reno are also OK in supporting roles.<br /><br />"The Pink Panther" will be enjoyed by many, but it sat on studio shelves for over a year before release, and that is not surprising.  This version has a lot to live up to, and I do not think it is successful overall.  Check this one out on DVD.</p></body></html>

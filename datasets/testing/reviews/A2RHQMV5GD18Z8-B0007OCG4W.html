<meta name="summary" content="Feels like a play"></head><body><p>Directed by Mike Nicholls<br />Starring Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, Jude Law and Julia Roberts<br />104 minutes<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: LPCM 5.1 (48kHz, 16-bit)<br />English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Italian: LPCM 5.1 (48kHz, 16-bit)<br />Italian: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese, Korean, Thai<br /><br />I used to confuse this film with Control (a Joy Division biopic), because Closer is also the name of Joy Division's last studio album.<br /><br />Mike Nichols (The Graduate) was in his 70s when he directed Closer and times have changed a lot since the days of The Graduate (1967). Both are excellent films though, despite the change.<br /><br />What elevates Closer from the pack is the writing. Patrick Marber wrote the play and also adapted the screenplay. If you have ever seen a TV series starring Steve Coogan, Marber probably wrote it. He has a talent for writing comedy and it's the type of comedy I like. That said, Closer is not a comedy; it's a drama with plenty of humor in it.<br /><br />Good actors can't really succeed without good writing, but this has both. All four do good work here. It has the feel of a Woody Allen film in some ways and also reminds me of Glengarry Glen Ross as both were adapted from plays. The dialogue comes at you at a fast pace and the actors play off one another well. Some conversations are a joy to experience.<br /><br />Both men sleep with both women (not at the same time) and the story deals with the relationships in an amusing way. The main point of the film is to show how much people lie to one another. Even when they think they are speaking absolute truth, it often turns out to be a lie. Are they saying these things to convince themselves of their good intentions? Are lies preferable to truth in some instances?<br /><br />The 104 minutes seem to pass very quickly. I was caught up in the story and the lives of these four people. It's more a romantic drama than a romantic comedy, despite the witty lines that appear throughout the story.<br /><br />I'm not sure which character I liked the most. They all have redeeming qualities. It's just a fun thing to experience and the writing is smart. I think the actors enjoyed delivering this wonderful dialogue. Owen and Portman received Oscar nominations for their performances.<br /><br />Overall 4.5/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Intriguing, spiritual, insightful and moving"></head><body><p>Simply put, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is an intriguing, powerful and even moving modern sci-fi blockbuster. I particularly like the symbolism: Klaatu=Christ, GORT=YaHWeH (aka Father God), etc. as well as the numerous Biblical references: Noah's Ark, the death plague or swarm, human beings trying to put God in a box literally, the sacrificial nature of agape love, etc. In other words, the film tackles subjects of great depth that every human being can relate to whatever their belief system. That itself separates it from the usual idiotic blockbuster fare.<br /><br />Now let me address some common criticisms (please see the film first before reading further due to SPOILERS):<br /><br />- The kid is initially quite annoying but this is understandable as he's an archetype for what humankind is: an annoying, untrusting, and overly-simplistic child-race. His sudden change into "maturity" represents how abruptly humanity needs to "grow-up." This helps make sense of the kid's repeated statements about killing Klaatu, which were magnified by the media's slander of Klaatu as a very dangerous escaped convict. Klaatu's strange and powerful antics helped feed this negative mindset in the boy. As for the kid's dead father, the boy was only 9 years old and understood his father to be a soldier. Why wouldn't he have a mythical impression that he killed 'bad guys' for a living, likely with his bare hands?<br /><br />- Judgment of mass human destruction was already set for the earth after hundreds of years of observation, including an 'Asian' scout who lived with humans for 70 years. Klaatu was sent to activate the judgment, UNLESS he observed some clear indication that the harsh, final judgment wasn't necessary yet. Klaatu didn't change the original plan UNTIL very late in the story, which is why he stated to Helen that he wasn't sure if he could overturn the judgment. Also, although Klaatu was clearly the primary alien agent, who says he was alone? Gort was there and he was only partially robotic in nature, as well as the older 'Asian' man. There were probably hundreds/thousands of other aliens involved in one way or another, collecting animals, etc.<br /><br />- The military attacks because their modus operandi is the defense of the nation, not to mention the sad nature of humanity in general, i.e. destructive.<br /><br />- When Bate's character, i.e. the government, finally decides to send Helen out to talk with Klaatu she was their proverbial last hope. All other governmental attempts to prevent the judgment failed abysmally up to this point, not to mention the judgment of mass destruction was ALREADY well into motion. Other national leaders were concerned with saving their own countries and hides.<br /><br />- The "sphere" was the central command orb. Klaatu didn't possess the power to stop the swarm himself; he had to get to the central orb to attempt to stop the mass destruction. Even then, he wasn't sure if he could do it. In fact, it cost him dearly.<br /><br />- The alien swarm only destroyed humanity and all human imprints (like the stadium, the governmental installation and the semi); I saw no evidence of the swarms destroying trees or animal life. The animal ark-orbs were obviously precautionary in nature; in other words, the aliens knew there would be collateral damage due to the nature of the swarms (high winds, etc.) so they snatched away all manner of animal life as a precaution.<br /><br />Klaatu made it quite clear what he was doing: saving the earth by destroying humanity and thus their intrinsic bent toward death and destruction. The way he put it was like this: If humanity lives the earth will die, but if humanity dies the earth will live.<br /><br />- The Aliens are powerful, but it's inaccurate to call them careless. Haven't they been monitoring the planet for centuries? Didn't they even have at least one agent live with humanity for 70 years. Their decision was carefully and patiently considered and decided.<br /><br />To sum-up humanity's evil and destructive bent as "minor-league carelessness" is shallow and un-enlightened, not to mention wholly inaccurate.<br /><br />The aliens' actions had nothing to do with "might makes right" but everything to do with saving a planet from the infection that would totally destroy it (people) if they failed to act, decisively. Their celestial judgment was that the cancer HAD to be cut out and time was of the essence.<br /><br />- Some say there's nothing to like. I love the film from beginning to end and have seen it three times. Really, the only "detestable characters" are the government as a whole, which is displayed as a cold, uncaring colossal machine. Helen (Jennifer Connelly) is a character of great beauty, reverence, wisdom and spirituality. John Cleese as the professor plays humanity's wise intercessor. Kathy Bates' character is extremely unlikable for most of the picture because she represents the government and comes off as a cold, arrogant machine-like witch with a capital 'B'. But, after she's completely humbled, she changes her tune, making her a likable character. As for the kid, he's only 9 years old and had lost both of this biological parents, his father recently. Needless to say, cut him some slack. Besides, he also changes his tune, so to speak, by the end and is extremely likable (by then). Klaatu actually takes on the role of his spiritual father. Remember Jacob falling on his face at his dad's grave? How could you NOT feel for him at that point?<br /><br />CONCLUSION: As you can see, none of these common gripes hold water. The insane bashing of the film is the result of an unjust critical feeding frenzy, pure and simple. I'm convinced that if people would disregard the monkey-see-monkey-do panning and view the film with an open mind they might actually enjoy it and possibly discover something worthwhile to ponder.</p></body></html>

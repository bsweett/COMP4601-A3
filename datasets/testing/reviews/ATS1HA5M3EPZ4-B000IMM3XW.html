<meta name="summary" content="In True Comic Book Fashion"></head><body><p>Finally, a movie based on a comic book that actually remains faithful to the original book and characters.  Of course if you're talking about the X-Men, you're talking subject matter that is more mature on many levels than most comics books.  The story line goes head on into the racism and fear of mutants, people born with genetic differences that don't surface until they hit puberty and give them never seen before gifts that allow them to do pretty amazing things, some incredibly beautiful, others intensely frightening.  Professor Charles Xavier (perfectly cast and portrayed by Patrick Stewart) is their unsung savior as a wealthy father figure who takes in these young people to try to mold them into something positive.  On the other end of the spectrum is a jaded and bitter Magneto, also portrayed well by Ian McKellen, who believes that normal humans have had their chance and now something has to be done to show them that mutants are superior.  Xavier's Senior students, Cyclops, Jean Gray and Storm help new found mutants Rogue and Wolverine discover who they are and what may lie in the future.  The actions scenes are unique and original.  All the actors give solid performances, especially Jackman, and Halle Berry impressed me with her Kenyan accent.  I hope she speaks more in the sequel.  The DVD is excellent for true fans because it's obvious that Director Brian Singer wanted so much more for this movie but just wasn't allowed to have it.  Time, budget and a last minute search for someone to play Wolverine caused serious constraints.  Considering the obstacles and the bad luck of past comic-book-to-movie adaptations, this one scores high and pleases fans and normal folks alike.  It stands for something more than just heroes and villians, and it gives us a story about people, no matter who they are or what they can do.  Buy this, if you have not already.</p></body></html>

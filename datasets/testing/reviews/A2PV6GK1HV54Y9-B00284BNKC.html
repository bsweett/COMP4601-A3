The story of four very different drug addicts is disturbing and yet fascinating to say the least. The last 10 minutes are the most graphic but the most important. Jared Leto's performance is the best I have ever seen from him, and of course it's Ellen Burstyn who steals the show. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are superb as well, Requiem for a Dream is a film no one should overlook. It's gritty, heartbreaking, honest, and this movie stays with you, now that's a great and profound film! I highly recommend it!</p></body></html>

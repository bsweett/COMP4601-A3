The set design is ok, the costumes are appropriate and some of the acting is actually good, but the characters are flat and the plot is way too contrived. A watchable flick to pass the time, it doesn`t possess the absorbing atmosphere os most of the director`s oeuvre, becoming just another mildly entertaining popcorn-movie. Tim Burton could do better than this by-the-numbers adventure.<br /><br />Watchable but far from memorable.</p></body></html>

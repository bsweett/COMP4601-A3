I remember his reign of terror, his regime's genocide, his banishing the Indians and Jews who had made Uganda their home.  Then I would see a clip of him on the nightly news; Amin was smiling, he was gregarious, charming--it just wasn't possible so likeable a man could be capable of such atrocities.  When Idi Amin disappeared into exile, in 1979, he disappeared from my memory.<br /><br />Until I saw THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND.  When I saw Forest Whitaker, the way he carried himself, the way he spoke, the way he could be so calmly maniacal. . .the hairs stood up on my neck.  Before my very eyes, Whitaker became Idi Amin, which is why this film is so believable--even though it's a fictional account of his regime.<br /><br />It's an account about Amin and the relationship he has with his personal physician, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy).  Nicholas wins instant points with "President" Amin because the young doctor is Scottish--and the Ugandan leader is an enthusiastic fan of Scotland and its culture.  In the beginning, all is well and good; Nicholas becomes intoxicated with his newfound wealth and power--with his ever-increasing influence with Amin.  But everything is an illusion; Uganda is unstable, Amin has many enemies, and when the enemies rebel, the dictator responds with an iron fist.  And the relationship with his physician becomes strained; Nicholas's naivete suddenly yields to remorse, to fear, to helplessness.  This thriller ends at Entebbe Airport, in one of the most brutal and disturbing cinematic scenes I've ever seen.<br /><br />Whitaker, McAvoy, and the rest of the cast furnish unforgettable roles--especially Whitaker, who won an Oscar.  Kudos to director Kevin MacDonald for making a film that is beautiful yet brutal, a film that has heart-pounding suspense.  THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND sends one chill after another down the spine, and brings Idi Amin back to vivid life.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

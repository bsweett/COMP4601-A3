<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, provided that you remember it's fiction"></head><body><p>When I watched this movie, I assumed that it's entirely fiction and that it makes no attempt to comment on the Catholic church or its history.  That may not be the actual case, but I think it's the best way to approach the movie.<br /><br />From that standpoint, I found this movie fairly entertaining.  The acting, scenery, and special effects are solid, as one would expect with a big-budget high-profile movie like this.  The plot, though implausible in many ways, still manages to passably hang together, and it's plenty suspenseful with some good twists and turns, so I had no problem staying engaged for the full duration of this fairly long movie.  And the ending was also pretty good, surprising me in some ways without feeling artificially tacked on or rushed.<br /><br />As far as broader messages we might apply to real life, I see two of them.  First, as the movie emphasizes, it's silly to assume that science and religion must be in conflict; that's the case only if one or both of them dogmatically overstep their bounds (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809136066">Science and Religion: From Conflict to Conversation</a> by John Haught for a good book on this).  Second, in a world which is now dangerously replete with nuclear weapons and other WMDs, we really need to think carefully about where our science and technology may lead before we continue developing them; it's immature and irresponsible to pursue them simply because we wish to satisfy our curiosity, revel in our ingenuity, or perpetually raise our standard of living (enough is enough at some point).<br /><br />Overall, this certainly isn't one of those really great movies which changes you for a long time (or permanently), but it's still decent entertainment, so I can recommend it to people looking for a combination of detective work, action, and suspense, all with a background of religious symbolism.</p></body></html>

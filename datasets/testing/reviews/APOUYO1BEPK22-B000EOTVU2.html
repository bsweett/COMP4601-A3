I was really excited to see it on Christmas day when it opened. I went by myself and to my surprise, the movie house was packed. As the movie kept trying to build itself up and make you care about these characters, all i could pay attention to was the movie audience. It seemed just about everyone in the house was thinking what I was thinking..."What did I just pay 8 dollars to see?". Once the killing started, I still didnt care about the characters because they bored me so much, that I actually thought they deserved to die for making me waste my money.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />There was some good in this movie. The killer was fantastic and just seemed like someone you'd never want to cross. Even with a friendly joke/poke at him, he scared the crap out of me. The atmosphere during the killings was also great. Everything seemed claustrophobic to me, even though they were in the extremely huge outback. It felt like no matter what they did...there just was NO escape. The death scenes were pretty good, especially the one girl trying to get away in the car.<br /><br />Then there is one other thing that really bothered me. I thought this movie was based on actual events, which made me believe that it was based on more fact than fiction. What I mean here is, during the death scenes, I really felt tense cause I usually picture myself in that situation. But at the end, the person that makes it out finally, never saw ANY of the death. And they also said the bodies were never found nor was the killer. So it was all made up. That dissapointed me and just was the last straw for me.<br /><br />Out of 5 stars I'd give it a 1. The death scenes were cool, but the rest of the movie was just plain bad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood's great de-glamorized Western"></head><body><p>I don't consider myself a particularly big fan of Clint Eastwood, at least as an actor. To me, he always seems to play the same kind of character in nearly every movie he's in. Occasionally, he'll find some fresh notes to play within his narrow range, but, despite his legendary status in Hollywood, I would hardly classify him as one of the finest actors of our time (although that probably won't stop Hollywood award shows from honoring him for Lifetime Achievement awards and such). That said, with the films that he's directed that I've seen, I'd dare to say that he might be a better director than actor. I have yet to see his most recent (and much-hyped) film MILLION DOLLAR BABY, but I was deeply sobered by his near-great MYSTIC RIVER (despite its total washout of a mystery plot), and, seeing this Academy Award-winning 1992 film recently, I was no less impressed by this film.<br /><br />UNFORGIVEN is as de-glamorized a Western movie as you are likely to see. There is no real nobility to be found in any of these characters the way there was with, say, Gary Cooper's Will Kane in HIGH NOON. Eastwood's William Munny, for example, is not a hero, but a broken-down, desperate man who is trying to escape his troubled past. Visually, there are some beautifully pictorial shots of the wide open spaces of the plains bathed in (rather mild) sunlight, but most of the time Eastwood and cinematographer Jack N. Green light the proceedings in a doom-filled atmosphere that might come off as heavy-handed to some, but is totally befitting its theme: how physical violence can be violent to the human soul. On the level of action, there is no exciting buildup to the final showdown, and even as it occurs, there is no glamor to be found, no catharsis. Instead of exhilaration, there is a profound note of tragedy as this film ends. A lot of action movies make you believe that taking violent revenge on someone is a satisfying way of closure. In UNFORGIVEN, Eastwood makes clear that there is no real satisfaction to be found in any kind of violence, provoked or not. This is perhaps an important film to see simply as a startling corrective to all the soulless spectacles of violence that seem to be the trademark of action films these days, movies that make you cheer violence and gets you in a sadistic mood, whereas Eastwood stresses its ugliness, both physically and mentally.<br /><br />UNFORGIVEN is helped immensely---for once---by Eastwood's own performance. Technically, he approaches his role in basically the same way he did with his Man With No Name performances in those Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns---tough, gruff, distanced. This William Munny is not much of a stretch for him. And yet there is an extra weariness to his performance here; you get the sense that he is trying to resist his more violent impulses, that he is always trying to tell himself, "I'm just here to get money, I'm just here to get money." Eastwood also has one scene which seems to cut through his steely persona: as he is in the midst of a delirious fever, there is a real, poignant touch of desperate emotion in his voice as he exclaims that he sees his own late wife, among other delirium-induced visions. That one scene is perhaps the closest I've seen Eastwood as an actor approach some emotion other than just anger. The other performances are good, but Eastwood's, in its own way, is rather special.<br /><br />UNFORGIVEN is admittedly a little plodding, but then Eastwood has never been one of those showboating directors who indulge in style for its own sake. He is more concerned with characters than with mere action here, and his deliberate approach to the material gives his themes room to breathe and grow in the mind of the receptive viewer. This is a powerful examination of the ugliness of violence, and it will certainly stay with you after it's over. Recommended.</p></body></html>

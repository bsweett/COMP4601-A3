<meta name="summary" content=""Airplane!" meets Jackie Chan!"></head><body><p>This movie is a work of pure comic genius, from an unexpected source! Who would have expected a Chinese director to come up with a Warner Bros.-style, Kung Fu, live action cartoon? Not me! Stephen Chow has OBVIOUSLY spent some time either in Hollywood, or in a history of film class drinking in the work of Tex Avery and Robert Clampett! This movie is a HOWL! Imagine if you will, (submitted for your approval,) The Zucker Bros. or pre-"High Anxiety" Mel Brooks getting a hold of a troupe of Chinese kung fu actors and using every "Looney Tunes" gag they can think of to milk the laughs for everything they're worth!<br /><br />Stephen Chow has all the earmarks of a master of kung fu slapstick, something this country hasn't really ever seen before. Aside from the great sight gags, he has also assembled a real soupcon of characters, from Rabbit-Tooth Jane, an unusual girl to say the least, (she acts VERY effeminate and has a look I really haven't seen in oriental women before,) to the bossy, battle-axe landlady, who also happens to be a dormant kung-fu doyenne, to her husband, a fellow, middle aged kung fu master, to a sweet, mute, Japanese-looking girl who sells ice cream. There are others, too numerous to mention here, without tiring you out!<br /><br />The director himself is the hero of the film, and he goes from being a sleazy, gangster wannabe to being a deadpan kung fu messiah during the course of the movie. One hilarious scene, while he is still a sleazebag, is when he tries terrorizing a poor community that has managed to avoid the wrath of an evil cabal called the "Axe Gang", in order to IMPRESS said gang. He calls for a challenger to step forward and to take him on, and he warns them "No cheating!" He calls on a humble lady farmer and dares her to hit him in the stomach, which she does, doubling him over immediately. Recovering from that, he starts picking at random...first a fella he refers to as "Shorty", who turns out to be about 7 feet tall when he stands up from his sitting position. After reminding the crowd "No cheating!", he then calls out a mousy looking guy with glasses, asking him to step forward. He does so, exposing a physique all out of character to his nerdy face. He then scans to what looks like a seven year old boy, who steps out, ALSO revealing a Charles Atlas-like upper torso! Fed up, (and completely cowardly,) he moves on.<br /><br />There is one very poetically done scene involving two hitmen who don't work in the ordinary way...and this is where a major fantasy element joins the cartoon zaniness: In the still of a nearly cloudless night, two assassins hired by the Axe Gang seek to take out the brave inhabitants of Pig Sty Village, who have stood up to their terror. These assassins use a long, autoharp-type instrument to strum out very sino-fiendly chords that somehow manage to produce lethal weapons and figures out of thin air. They set these against the tailor, the baker and the landlady, the tailor and the baker having surprised you earlier with their kung fu expertise...with images of flying sabers, armored zombies and spears. The landlady manages to take them out with her patented "Lion's Roar", sending them whee-wee-wee, all the way home!<br /><br />If you buy but ONE kung fu movie in your life, make it this one! This is, hands down, the funniest, most enjoyable martial arts movie I've seen so far, and I've seen all of Bruce Lee's major releases!</p></body></html>

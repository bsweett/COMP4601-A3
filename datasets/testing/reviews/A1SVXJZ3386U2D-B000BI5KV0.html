This is a masterfully filmed picture with incredible nature scenes and a compelling narration by Morgan Freeman.  I admit that I felt a twinge of guilt by watching the Freeman-narrated version.  I felt that I owed it to the French production company to see their version with English subtitles.  However, this was the first version that I was able to view.  Nature can be very challenging and we see the depth of such challenges in "March of the Penguins".  I won't elaborate on the extent of those challenges because I wouldn't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.  Let me just state that I was emotionally involved in this movie from the start to the finish and I make no appologies for that.<br /><br />I read an excellent review of this movie by a person who questioned our humanization of instinctive, non-emotional, non-judgemental roles played by "dumb" animals.  That reminded me of the opposite reaction to a book/movie "Chariots of the Gods?" which suggested that the more primative societies of pre-Columbia America (and other ancient civilizations) were too "dumb" to have created the things they left behind.  Thus aliens from outer space HAD to have created these archaeological wonders.  Why not just marvel at what an amazing world we live in.  For those who see in it God's incomprehensible miracle, so be it.  For those who want to see an extreme example of natural "love", so be it.  For those who just want a chance to see such a marvelous view of a world they'll never see in person, so be it.  Whatever you get out of "March of the Penguins" can only be positive.<br /><br />It's not often that a film is made that qualifies as a "5 Star" movie for ALL generations.  When it is, the name Disney, Spielberg, or National Geographic is usually connected to it.  This is a MUST SEE movie for everyone so don't get left out.</p></body></html>

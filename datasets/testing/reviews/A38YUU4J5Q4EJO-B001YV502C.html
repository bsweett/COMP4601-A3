<meta name="summary" content="Futuristic movie  well done with excellent soundtrack"></head><body><p>This movie is set in the year 2027, and humanity is on the verge of extinction. There has not been a baby born for 18 years, for women have become infertile for some unknown reason, and the government is behind it.<br /><br />Now Clive Owen is asked by his ex, Julianne Moore(the leader of a human rights organization called "Human Project" fighting against the Government) to help get a pregnant woman out of the country.<br /><br />She delivers her baby before they can get out and there are many obstacles blocking thier way.<br />When she has the baby in a ramshackle building, it makes you think of another miraculous birth 2,000 years ago, and the birth in this movie is....something to behold.<br /><br />I think this is one of the most original sci-fi movies made in a long time.I also loved the soundtrack, and especially the title song off an old King Crimson album "In the court of the Crimson King."<br />The soundtrack really FIT somehow.<br /><br />This movie was well acted, and directed and what I really do imagine the world to be like in the DISTANT future, not the near future as the movie is set in.<br /><br />Either way, the tone (and all of the surroundings in this movie is fittingly dark and sad. It puts you right in the middle of a tired and used up world that has an overall feel of being OVER.<br /><br />The DVD also has a lot of added special features, and one of them is showing how they made the birthing scene with the help of backdrops and computer animation to look so real! It really has some interesting material in it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Sci Fi I am sure you will love this.</p></body></html>

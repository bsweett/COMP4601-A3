<meta name="summary" content="A fond, bittersweet farewell"></head><body><p>In the film world, a trilogy can be a good thing, a chance to tell a long story over three parts, enabling us to become emotionally attached to the characters and the world they live in. Unfortunately however, many times the third film in the series can be tired and worn out, the result of the creativity and spark dying out long before the cameras roll.<br /><br />Thankfully however, that's not the case with Toy Story 3, which is the perfect ending to the series, and a moving and emotional one at that.<br /><br />Picking up several years after the end of its predecessor, Toy Story 3 finds Andy, now 18, packing up and heading off to college. Woody, Buzz, and all his old toys now spend their time in a toy box, essentially forgotten. When told that he either has to store them in the attic, throw them out, or donate them to a daycare center, Andy sets events in motion that will lead to what is essentially judgment day for Woody and the gang...the fact that Andy has outgrown them, and that they are essentially, in Andy's words, junk, facing an uncertain future.<br /><br />Of all of Pixar's movies, it's my opinion that Toy Story 3 is by far the most emotional. While a simple story about the toys we all know so well, it tackles the issue of mortality. Unlike what Randy Newman's famous, "You've Got A Friend in Me" song says, friendships do die. Relationships drift apart, and life changes, and not always for the better. And it's here that Toy Story 3 shines. It may not have the most action of the series (Film 2 holds that honor), but it does have the most heart, as it follows the toys we all know and love as they struggle to find their place in a frightening world where they could be thrown out, discarded, and destroyed at any time. This is a film about loss, the ending of relationships, and the fact that nothing lasts forever.  Nowhere is this more apparent then the film's final act, which is the most dramatic of the entire series (and without question, Pixar's greatest drama scenes), and concludes with an ending that had me in tears, and at some points, sobbing.<br /><br />It's always hard to see great things coming to an end. I've grown up with these characters, having seen the first film in grade school, and now seeing the gang's final adventure shortly after graduating from college. But, as cheesy at it sounds, it's a relationship I'll always treasure, and will be grateful for enjoying. As Buzz says early in the film, it's best to go out on a high note, and Toy Story 3 accomplishes it with ease. In my opinion, it's Pixar's most emotional film, and their most bittersweet...but even through the tears, you'll walk out with a smile.</p></body></html>

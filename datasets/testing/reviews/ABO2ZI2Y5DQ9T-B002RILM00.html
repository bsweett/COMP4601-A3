<meta name="summary" content="Incoherent and Pointless Remake"></head><body><p>Neil LaBute's remake of "The Wicker Man" is possibly the worst film of the decade, probably worse than "Battlefield Earth" and "Epic Movie," considering that the former film actually stars two Oscar winners, Nicholas Cage and Ellen Burstyn (the latter with strangest make-up on the face). And their acting is very disappointing.<br /><br />What you see here is beautiful landscapes and an utterly incoherent story about a missing girl and a police officer. The truths are obvious from the moment when Nicolas Cage's policeman landed on a remote, privately owned island off the coast, but our dim-witted hero never knows the right thing to do. Instead he does many silly things and perhaps his "bear" costume part would be the worst. But there are more to come before and after that, as many other reviewers rightly pointed out.<br /><br />But what made me really sad is the presence of Leelee Sobieski as Sister Honey. I just couldn't believe what I am seeing during her "brawl" scene and its terrible results. If director wanted to make a point about war between men and women, he surely made it with dreadful portrayal of Sister here, or any other terribly-acted Sisters and heavy-handed metaphor of bees.<br /><br />Please. We don't need any more "re-imagined" version of classic films. Also, British films should be left untouched if you don't have a more suitable idea to update them. The concept of female-dominated society may be intriguing, but that idea is hardly compatible with the eerie world of "The Wicker Man."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I'm not being mean, it's one of the stupidest movies I've seen"></head><body><p>Now some movies don't have the "empty pocket" syndrome of other films where if you need money the studio just gives you some more to help, provided the film makes its money and then some. But there are some films that come out with a limited budget and it keeps. Such was the case with the Brothers Grimm which was made for around 80 million. Now to Joe Normal, 80 million is a lot but on a major picture, it wouldn't even cover the salaries for Mel Gibson, Will Smith, Julia Roberts and Govenah Ahnuld. Well unfortunately Brothers Grimm suffers not only from laughably bad CG but an even stupid story.<br /><br />The world is basically all fairy tales in one world. So when Little Red Riding Hood and Greta(from Hansel and Gretel) are kidnapped, townspeople look to the French to help. So they send Will and Jacob, noted for being demon vanquishers. Only problem is they're con men, using trickery to make people believe they're being attacked, exorcise the demon, take the money and take off. So when they're brought in to investigate, they find themselves in the middle of something that could be the real thing.<br /><br />The movie sucks and I can't figure it out. The talent: Terry Gillam, noted surreal director known for 12 Monkeys, Fear and Loathing... and Brazil. Good cast with Matt Damon, Heath Ledger and easy on the eyes Monica Bellucci. Maybe it's not even scary? The "scares" are meant to freak us out and uncalm us yet we're watching with mainly apathy. Is it dramatic? Not really. The stakes never seem to be high and there's no rejoice when our villain is taken care of.<br /><br />Since the film has the look of Sleepy Hollow's distant cousin, it certainly looks the part until the CGI steps in. This is laughably bad and you can obviously tell where the CG steps in. The CG works best when it's not noticeable, where it's in the scene but it's actually hidden, almost like you couldn't tell it was. Here it's painfully obvious with a bad Gingerbread Man effect and one effect where 2 people fly just looks like bad compositing. Serenity had a small budget(even smaller I believe) yet the CG looks better there then here. Late in the film there's an abundance of red and it just looks very ugly.<br /><br />Is there any redeeming value? Maybe. Monica Bellucci and Lena Headley are a nice sight and Heath Ledger is quite believable as very fidgety Jacob. Peter Stormare, known for Lost World and Armageddon knows how to play the comic relief, often playing foreign characters and here maybe it's overwriting but he seems a bit TOO much in the movie.<br /><br />I knew that people found it stupid before I rent it but I thought people would say that about any film yet you watch and it's pretty good. Well, sorry guys, should've listened to you.</p></body></html>

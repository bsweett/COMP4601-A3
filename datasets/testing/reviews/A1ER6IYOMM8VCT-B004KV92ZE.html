<meta name="summary" content="HIP AND FUNNY WITH A PERFECT PO IN JACK BLACK!"></head><body><p>Once again CGI animated films have shown they can stand up against live action films. Kung Fu Panda is another excellent movie with a stellar cast that will keep young and old alike entertained from start to finish. This martial arts based movie has beautiful serene settings, fast and furious action and hip and hilarious comedy. Jack Black with his zany style seems to have been born to play Po.  The animation is first rate,  inspired story and characters and a lot of fun to watch! the DVD transfer is first rate and the DVD has some interesting extra material including commentary, making of and much more.</p></body></html>

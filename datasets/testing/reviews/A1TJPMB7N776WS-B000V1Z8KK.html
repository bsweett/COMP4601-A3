<meta name="summary" content="Targets"></head><body><p>Lots of things go Boom, heads explode as well as roll in Antoine Fuqua's (the terrific "Training Day" and the effective "Tears of the Sun") on the one hand thoroughly reprehensible yet on the other, totally satisfying entertainment, "Shooter," starring Mark Wahlberg as a psychically wounded former military sniper, Bob Lee Swagger licking his wounds in a back woods cabin attempting to forget his time in the Marines.<br />Then Swagger is pulled back into his old life of high powered, long range rifles and into a higher powered, full of intrigue Presidential assassination plot that of course goes awry.<br />Wahlberg, formerly of the jeans at the hips fame who has successfully moved away from teen heart throb to excellent actor, has been very effective in films particularly in "The Departed" and "The Yards," a very under-rated film with Charlie Theron, directed by James Gray. As Swagger, Walhberg exhibits real screen credibility and weight. His performance is committed and human. Also making a good impression is Kate Mara as a steel butterfly-type woman: beautiful but as deadly at home at the stove as she is with a rifle.<br />Fuqua proves once again that he is a great director of action and this film is big, bold and noisy: explosions and gun battles abound. But Fuqua is also a great director of actors: Denzel's towering performance in "Training Day" and Walberg and Kate Mara in this film.<br />Though loud and obnoxious at times, there is definitely an intellect at work here and "Shooter" is never crass and manipulative though its origins can be traced back to the bizarre juxtaposition of both "JFK" (it is no coincidence that Wahlberg's character's name is very similar to Lee Harvey Oswald) and "Rambo." Now there's a combo.</p></body></html>

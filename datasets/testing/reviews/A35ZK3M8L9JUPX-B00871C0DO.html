<meta name="summary" content="American Werewolf in London Special Edition"></head><body><p>Two American students are on a walking tour of England and are attacked by a Werewolf. One is killed, the other is mauled. The Werewolf is killed, but reverts to it's human form, and the townspeople are able to deny it's existence. The surviving student begins to have nightmares of hunting on 4 feet at first, but then finds that his friend and other recent victims appear to him, demanding that he find a way to die to release them from their curse, being trapped between worlds because of their unnatural death. A near definitive werewolf movie that's bloody, scary, funny, satirical,intelligent, sexy, charming and ultimately sad. With a soundtrack that's perfectly placed, and composer Elmer Bernstein perfectly placing the music. Grab the popcorn and hang on folks.</p></body></html>

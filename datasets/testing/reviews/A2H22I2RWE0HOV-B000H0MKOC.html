<meta name="summary" content="Not As Hysterically Funny As I Thought......"></head><body><p>When I saw the previews for Thank You For Smoking for the first time on a new release DVD I was intrigued.  I had never even heard of this movie before.  In the previews, the movie seemed hysterically funny.  But that is what previews are for.  It's not hysterically funny.  Not at all.  Now...  I know what you're thinking.  I didn't like the movie.  Right?  Wrong! Thank You For Smoking is a good movie.  It's thought-provoking and clever and feindishly un-PC and I like that.  I like it alot!  Movies that poke fun at all the inconsistent beliefs of uptight Americans usually aren't this good, but Smoking is.  Well-written and perfectly casted (Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, Katie Holmes, Sam Elliott, William H. Macy, and more!) Thank You For Smoking follows along with the exploits of Tobacco Lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aron Eckhart) who's greatest asset is his ability to BS and argue.  While pushing a product like cigarettes onto the citizens of the world Naylor still manages to keep himself grounded,trying to teach life lessons to his 12 year old son.  Are cigarettes poison?  Not enough evidence to suggest that, as Naylor would say.  It's big business vs. anyone with so-called morales.  Poignant without being pushy, Thank You For Smoking makes you think while you laugh.  There are alot of subjects touched upon here that will make certain people squirm or look away, and that I think is why I enjoyed it so much.  Was it drop dead funny?  No.  No like they tote it in the ads and previews.  But it is good.  I will definitely watch it again.<br /><br />DIG IT!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I Know You" ~ Such Childhood Memories Are Never Forgotten"></head><body><p>I first viewed `Sleeping Beauty' during its original theatrical release in '59. It was a birthday present. I had just turned seven (you may now do the math). I loved it then and only recently have watched with my nineteen year old daughter at her request.<br /><br />`Sleeping Beauty' stands at the end of phase I in the history of Disney's production of feature length animation films. Following such early classics like `Snow White' (37), `Alice in Wonderland' (51) and `Peter Pan' (53) and preceding the modern masterpieces `Little Mermaid' (89), 'Beauty and the Beast' (91), `Aladdin' (92), `Pocahontas' (95) and `Mulan' (98) you can easily observe both the gains in production values from the earlier and the shortcomings in comparison with those that followed.<br /><br />Yes the characters are grossly undeveloped when judged by today's standards and the animation falls noticeable short of what can now be done, the colors are brilliant and alluring the three good fairies Flora, Flauna and Merryweather enchanting and the music memorable.<br /><br />Whether you love it or just like this film it's a piece of Disney history and should ultimately be judged by its main target audience, children.</p></body></html>

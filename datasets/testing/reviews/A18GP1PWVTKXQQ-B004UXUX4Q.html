<meta name="summary" content="Light weight, Payne quirky dramedy, has its up and downs"></head><body><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'The Descendants' was directed by Alexander Payne, who also was a co-producer on the recently released 'Cedar Rapids'. Both films fall under the rubric of 'quirky indie dramedy' and director Payne seems to be drawn to this sort of quirky subject matter. While the 'quirkiness' and the 'comedy' are present in 'The Descendants', it's more muted than some of the other films Payne has been involved in.<br /><br />'The Descendants' involves how a family copes after the mother winds up comatose, following a near fatal head injury while water skiing, off the coast of Wakikiki in Hawaii. The husband, Matt King, somewhat mechanically played by George Clooney, is a Honolulu-based attorney who refers to himself as the 'back-up' parent. The first part of 'The Descendants' involves some rather ordinary scenes of Matt attempting to reign in his rebellious daughters (10 year old Scottie bullies a classmate and 17 year old Alex is found drinking when Matt goes to fetch her at the exclusive boarding school she's been staying at).<br /><br />Matt begins his journey of self-discovery when he's forced to make a decision as the head of a large family that owns a large parcel of land on the Hawaiian island of Kuau'i. The family has seven years to dispose of 25,000 acres before the family trust expires. Matt has openly backed the family majority's decision to sell the land to a wealthy developer, over the objections of many of the locals who fear that the pristine land will be spoiled by over development.<br /><br />I'll repeat here my definition of the quirky indie dramedy--it's a film that features a "quirky protagonist, who must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing with the aid of quirky allies, while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo." The reactionary group here is the developer and the family members who conspire to sell off their land, to the detriment of the community at large. The quirky protagonist is Matt, who generally resorts to inoffensive, quirky machinations, to achieve his goals. The only real negative note that casts Matt (as well as daughter Alex) in a bad light, is when they refuse to accept the apology of Troy, who was driving the boat, when the mother had her accident. Otherwise, he can be found engaging in such quirky and harmless stratagems, such as mouthing off to his comatose wife in the hospital room or giving a passionate kiss, instead of a peck on the cheek ,to the wife of a man who had an affair with his wife, prior to her devastating injury.<br /><br />When Alex reveals that her mother had an affair with a man, Matt is determined to seek him out. This constitutes the 'second act' of the film and we're curious to see what Matt decides to do. Along the way, Matt gains an unusual quirky ally in the form of Alex's tactless teenage friend, Sid, who ends up being punched in the eye by the comatose woman's father, who holds Matt responsible for his daughter's injury.<br /><br />Through perseverance and outright luck, Matt finally tracks down the man his wife had the affair with; he's Brian Speer, a real estate developer, who Matt finds on Kuau'i, vacationing with his wife and kids. Fortunately there are no violent recriminations as Matt merely gives Brian a tongue lashing and promises to keep the affair secret from his wife (kudos to the screenwriters for keeping things low key and light weight!).<br /><br />Things get wrapped up in 'The Descendants' also on a low key note. Matt simply changes his mind and decides not to sign off on having the family sell the land to the developer. There may have been a taste of revenge on Matt's part, since Brian was set to receive some hefty real estate commissions, had the land been sold to the developer. But Matt makes it clear that it's his love of the land that compels him to go against the majority of the family's wishes.<br /><br />'The Descendants' is very light weight but has its heart in the right place. Not only does Matt get in touch with his altruistic side by keeping the land but also learns to become a better father. The family also is able to 'move on' after the mother is taken off life support. Only the quirky comedy (that's not very funny) gets in the way, epitomized by Julie Speer's rant, at film's end, when she 'loses it', revealing that she's figured it out that husband Brian indeed had been having an affair all along, with Matt's wife.<br /><br />I'm not sure if 'The Descendants' deserves all the awards it's been nominated for, since a main part of the story, Matt's decision to seek out his wife's lover, turns out to be markedly inconsequential. Nonetheless, the film is mildly interesting, especially in light of the protagonist's self-discovery, where the community benefits and a family is made whole.</p></body></html>

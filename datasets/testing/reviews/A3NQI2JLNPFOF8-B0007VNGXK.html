<meta name="summary" content="Del Toro rules."></head><body><p>Sixty years ago Hitler's Thule Society performs a dark ceremony intended to summon a terrible demon into this world in order to usher in the apocalypse.  Thwarted by the allies, the dark magicians fail...but not before a child slips through from the demon realm.  An infant demon in which through the care and guidance from those who oppose the evil forces, would become Hellboy, the greatest weapon the forces of darkness ever had to face.<p>It seems Ron Perlman's performance as Hellboy is the closest thing ever to the second coming of Ash.  You know, the guy from the Evil Dead trilogy that just ruled over every single person lucky enough to see him on screen.  No one BUT Ron Perlman could've brought this character to life in such a glorious manner.  However, it is very clear that without Ron Perlman and his clever dialogue, this movie could have been nowhere near as awesome as it turned out to be.  But enough about Ron Perlman, on to Guillermo del Toro.  Superb action director of Mimic and Blade II, del Toro also is known for his moody aptmospheres and gothic style (check out Cronos or The Devil's Backbone).  Hellboy is the ultimate combination of both the intense dramatic action sequences of Blade II and the stylish cinematography of Cronos.  Though not my favorite del Toro film (that would The Devil's Backbone), Hellboy is a lot more than dumb comic book fun if you give it a chance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rambo Deserves A Better Send-Off Than This..."></head><body><p>As a huge Stallone fan, I really looked forward to 2006's Rocky Balboa. And it paid off dearly. So shortly after hearing that ole Sly was bringing back his other 80's icon John Rambo for a fourth time, I quickly was reminded how well he brought back Mr. Balboa into a new generation. This was going to be a cinch, right?<br /><br />Well, not really. After seeing leaked trailers months before the film's release, the public quickly found out just how graphic this film was going to be. Limbs blown off, bullet wounds spraying, and people just exploding like never seen in a Rambo film. And trust me, while seeing the actual film, they are still in there, but what would be left without them? Not much really.<br /><br />It seems old Rambo's been hanging out in Thailand, as a ferry boat captain of some sorts that reluctantly is rented by some do-gooder group that wants to bring medicine & supplies to a nameless area of war-torn Burma. Of course, minutes after dropping them off all Hell breaks loose, and eventually Rambo, this time paired with an amazingly stereotypical mercenaries team, must go in to save whoevers left alive. Do I need to say more?<br /><br />Seriously, I shouldn't expect Apocalypse Now here, but after the greatness in story of Rocky Balboa, which Sly also wrote, there should have been more here than just porn levels of gore and old Sly in a T-Shirt, demoted of course from his tank-top/shirtless days gone by. Even the baddie was weak for Rambo standards, with no lines or flair of past protaginists.<br /><br />Also, the runtime is awfully short, and it does go quick yet with that empty feeling. As for the disc, here's what got me. I saw the 1 disc version, and when it comes to bare-bones, wow this one really takes the cake. While Disc One of the more expensive 2 Disc Edition has commentary, featurettes, and tons of bonus features on the same disc as the movie, the 1 Disc Version is movie and that's it. Hell, it's even on a single layer disc. This wouldn't be all that bad, but considering that Disc Two of the bigger edition is nothing but the IPod version of the film, to release two different Disc One's seems really cheap. So even though the 2 Disc is usually only 5 dollars more than the 1, even if you "just want the movie", it still seems like a rip-off when most 2 Disc sets feature the same disc but with an extra one in addition to.<br /><br />Overall, I was slighly disapointed in my man, Sly. This could have been a more broader, fuller send-off than this. Sure, congrats to the man to get away with such graphicness in an "R" rated film (Jeez, this wasn't Unrated?...WOW!), but even gorehounds like me need a little more in between the head-rolling. Well, at least Rocky got the better walk-off in the sunset....</p></body></html>

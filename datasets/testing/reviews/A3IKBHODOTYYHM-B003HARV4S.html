Director Neil Burger makes The Illusionist more than just a story though, taking on an artistic quality that transcends typical filmmaking. Brilliant atmosphere, authentic characters, a great script, beautiful scenery, and a wonderful music score make this one a gem.<br /><br />One of the film's interesting aspects is just the allegorical quality that emerges. It's much more than a thriller, mystery, or period film about love and magic. Eisenheim's crushed hopes of love in childhood are given a second chance, and this plays into the theme of rekindling lost love, giving the film a parable-like quality.  Illusion-- the subject of what is real and what is not--is a central idea in not only the story's premise, but the film's d&eacute;nouement at the finish. For this reason, you can't take everything at "face value" - supernatural and mystery play a major role in the building of Eisenheim as a character.<br /><br />The characterization and script are superb, and this really keeps the plot's flow at a steady pace. Edward Norton brings the character of Eisenheim to life, giving a mysterious yet charismatic aspect to the role. He makes this idea of creating illusion an art form on the big screen, as he dazzles many in the audience with his shows. It is later on in life when, while doing a show, he meets up with childhood friend and sweetheart Sophie, who is now engaged to the Crown Prince, a villainous man who reportedly abuses his lovers. This meeting sets into motion the conflict between Eisenheim and the Crown Prince, archrivals for Sophie's love. Another important role is that of the Inspector, who is both suspicious and in awe of Eisenheim's illusionary feats, but must ultimately answer to the Crown Prince. While the Crown Prince wants Eisenheim shut down for blasphemy and heresy, the Inspector has no real proof to charge him with.<br /><br />Mythical elements, a great music score, and clever imagination make this feel like we are transported to Vienna circa 1900 to watch the story unfold. There is magic and illusion, and the suspense builds after Eisenheim's shows take on a much darker feel, in which he can reach into the "other world" to find out information about lost loved ones.<br /><br />Over all, there is a great job of filmmaking and storytelling here. There is definitely an art-like quality to The Illusionist, and there is more than meets the eye!</p></body></html>

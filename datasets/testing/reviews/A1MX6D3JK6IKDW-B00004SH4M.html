<meta name="summary" content="AGENT 006.5"></head><body><p>Not the complete success of its predecessor,Dr. No,but aided by terrific photography and one of the best movie theme songs of all time, this film can certainly hold its head up in polite society. The plot is simple enough,to the point of being totally absurd. Mr.Goldfinger would like to increase his world gold deposits' values 1000% by rendering Ft. Knox"s supply useless for 58 years (using a small atomic device). Also, the script puts our hero James Bond (Connery) in a series of situations, including one on a table with a laser headed straight for his scrotum, in which he could easily be killed. Indeed, in a movie that features agent 007, we find a careless agent, one whom Matt Damon as Jason Bourne would eliminate today with a mere hiccup. Bourne is almost always the master of his fate,Bond relies too much on luck, fate, and the adage that good will triumph over evil. Have you read a newspaper lately? What was great entertainment in 1964, is still a good view today.But, as in golf, one is watching Arnold Palmer here, not Tiger Woods.</p></body></html>

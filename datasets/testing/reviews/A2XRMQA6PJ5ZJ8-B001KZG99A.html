<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good flick; great special effects"></head><body><p>This is a pretty good adaptation of the famous Marvel comic book character.  Hollywood couldn't resist having the film push a pacifist political message (Tony Stark abandons making weapons, etc.) but overall the plot moves along pretty good.  The special effects are really good.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper, Tony Stark's girl Friday; she is absolutely spectacular.  She combines beauty with a charming vulnerability, and is perfect in the role.  Robert Downey Jr. was really not my idea of Tony Stark, but he carries the role off pretty well, and gives us lots of laughs.<br /><br />This is the best adaptation of a comic book superhero to the screen since Spider-Man.  Well worth seeing.  RJB.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kinetic script!"></head><body><p>This is a movie plenty of action. The script runs about an old thief who decides make the las robery. Thirty five millions in gold is a great temptation . But suddenly there will be a twist of fate.<br />Wonderful locations and excellent special effects. Shuterland as always, steals the show. Walberg is OK and the cosmic beauty of Charlize Theron plays a convincing role.<br />There are many hair raising sequences.<br />A good entertainment but without the punch of the previous version from the sixties.</p></body></html>

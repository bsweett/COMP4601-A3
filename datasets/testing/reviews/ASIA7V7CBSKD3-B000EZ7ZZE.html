Now that the second installment is out I have to say I am more then just a fan and am eagerly awaiting for the third movie to come out.<br /><br />Apocalypse picks up right where the first one left off.  Racoon City is being sealed off as the virus can't be contained.  Alice and a handful of others must find a high ranking scientist's daughter who didn't make it out of the city.  The ending leaves you wanting more as well.<br /><br />Filled with action, and much more exciting plot (still you must see Resident Evil prior to this one), Apocalypse delievers one wild ride of a movie.  A must own for any fan of the game or great Sci-Fi movies.</p></body></html>

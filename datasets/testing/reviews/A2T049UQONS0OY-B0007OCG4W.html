<meta name="summary" content="A comedy hidden behind a good script"></head><body><p>My friends all told me this was a very depressing film about people that go out of their way to harm the ones they love. Given that the cast was starry and the script was intelligent, how could everyone be so wrong about this comedy hidden behind an incredibly handsome script?<br /><br />This is, indeed, a comedy. The ridiculous situations these people put themselves in had me laughing out loud over and over again. Julia Roberts was so funny as a vitimized victim -- the victim of her own foolishness -- that it was humorous.<br /><br />Jude Law, who starts out the one with the best handle on everything, that gets both women he wants, then ends up being the one most humiliated by a guy named Larry (Clive Owen) (being named Larry, I know what kind of roles are handed out to people named that) that it is, in the end, the pinnacle of comic irony.<br /><br />I think it would be easier to accept this film on face value if the four people involved were regular people. Since instead they are a writer, artist/photographer, stripper and doctor, I think you have to accept that these are not really people; they are actors playing out thinly veiled Hollywood cliches doing things handed to them from a script.<br /><br />The relationship to real life is negligible, at best, since their actions are the equivalent of my 20-year-old college girlfriend who regularly had more than one boyfriend. They are not the actions of mature 35-year-olds, which describe three of the participants.<br /><br />As comedy with irony interwoven, I think this film is successful in its display of human nature. But as a movie about dysfunctional relationships it is less successful that many smaller films and closer to being ordinary. Thankfully, at least one person saw the humor in this arrangement.<br /><br />This film most reminded me of Mike Nichols' now 40-year-old masterpiece, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf", another blockbuster about a pair of dysfunctional couples. Only that movie was played straight. This one, like "The Graduate", was played for laughs about the human condition.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Zombie genre flick updated"></head><body><p>This is basically the old zombie movie plot updated. The zombies are those infected by a virus let loose on the world by misguided animal rights activists. What sets this apart is that it is well made by the same team that did, "Trainspotting" and that it is British. Good, fast-paced, suspense film.</p></body></html>

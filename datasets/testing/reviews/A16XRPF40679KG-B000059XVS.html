<meta name="summary" content="where's the blu ray edition?"></head><body><p>If any movie ever deserved to be on blu ray this is the one.  It is a cinematic masterpiece.  This two disc version has the best print around but it still needs a blu ray release.  This great picture has it all and you have 382 other reviews to tell you that.  The man the story is about proves that history is more fascinating than fiction and Lawrence was a great man indeed.  He had his troubles just like the great actor who protrays him in this  movie Peter O Toole , whose alcoholism robbed him of alot of his life by making it a giant haze.  Thankfully he's still around to provide us with great performances like he did in "venus".<br />Every scene in this movie is fantastic although they gloss over Lawrence of arabia's rape by the turkish troops.  In middle eastern lands it is quite common for many men guards or others to rape male prisoners and that incident drove Lawrence over the edge leading to him to slaughter the turks in large numbers.  Which marred the man's greatness to a degree, but in those days who could he talk to about it?  In spite of that watching this  movie is like watching perfection in cinematography and pacing. It just does everything right and the story is a important one</p></body></html>

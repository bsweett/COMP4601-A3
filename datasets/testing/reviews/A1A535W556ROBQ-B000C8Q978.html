Jarmusch, who has given us such off-beat classics as Stranger than Paradise and Down By Law, seemed at a loss as to how to present suburbia, which made me wonder why he wanted to go there in the first place.  This movie plods along at its ineptitude pace as Murray, as Don Johnston, searches out a handful of girlfriends from the past, after receiving a mysterious note that he has a grown son.  We get cameos by Julie Delpy, Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange and an unrecognizable Tilda Swindon along the way, which shows you just how much cache Jarmusch has these days.  However, the stilted dialog barely holds the vapid scenes together.  About the only excitement is a brief peep show by Alexis Dziena as "Lolita."  I kid you not. And, the only real binding force is the selection of music by the Ethiopiques, given to Don by his neighbor Winston, who prods him into this road trip.  I can only hope that this completes this depressing cycle of movies for Murray, which included Rushmore and Lost in Translation.</p></body></html>

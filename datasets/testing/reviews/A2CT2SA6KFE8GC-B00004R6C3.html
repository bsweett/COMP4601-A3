<meta name="summary" content="Hey you!"></head><body><p>Drop that latte, get that lemon biscotti out of your mouth, drag your behind down to your local dvd retailer and buy The Thing.  Even if you've never seen it, buy it anyway.  This is one of the best examples of what a "B" movie can be;  Yet another example of the magic of 70s/80s horror films.  You're not gonna see any annoying psychic kids, hipster know-it-all teenagers, cutesy hero animals,[sissy] CGI monsters, or happy endings in this one. No, this is a cast of middle aged, hairy, unattractive, alcoholic brutes.  In other words-REALISTIC.  This was one of my faves as a kid, and still is today.  The fx in this film are still fantastic, and there's not one computer effect to be found.  But don't take my word for it, kiddies, take a look at all of the reviews here;  You'll come across maybe three or four truly negative reviews.  Everyone else knows what they're talking about here.  The negative reviews seem to be nothing but complaints that there is too much gore and violence in the film.  Is there such a thing in a horror film?  Saying that there's too much gore in a horror film is like saying that your employer pays you too much.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Humanity during times of war."></head><body><p>This is a must-see film for anyone who wants to even pretend to be 'up' on film history or attempt to pass pronouncements on current films.  David Lean crafted one of history's best cinematic experiences with this 1957 film.  Alec Guiness is great as the 'leader' of a group of British POW's under the supervision of a Japanese war camp superintendant.  The prisoners have been forced to build a bridge over the river that bears the film's namesake.  Less an action film than a drama, BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI gives us fascinating characters and shows us how they change over the course of the film.  In the end we have learned much about each of them, and no one is quite what he seems to be at the beginning.  While there is action, this is almost more of a character study in how humans bear up under extraordinary circumstances. <p>Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

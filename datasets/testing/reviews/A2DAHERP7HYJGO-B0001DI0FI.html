That is to say it combines both of these depictions of war, never truly making one or the other seem the way it was. And I believe that that is what it would actually boil down to; a combination of the physical and emotional scars of war as well as the admiration of men of courage.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1805 during the Napoleonic wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is in command of the H.M.S. Surprise with instructions to ferret out the Acheron, a French ship that has been wreaking havoc off the coast of South America. With a hardy crew and a combination of battle scarred and fresh faced officers, they set out to do the task they were assigned.<br /><br />But rather than wait till half way through the film to have these two adversaries confront one another, the film nearly opens with a full blown sea battle. But this one is unlike most offered in films from the past. The glowing heroics of jumping from ship to ship, the always missing cannonballs, the smiling faces are replaced with a more realistic atmosphere.<br /><br />The Surprise is caught off guard and pelted with cannon fire, ripping the ship apart. The battle is not so much fought using guns and swords as it is using tactics and maneuvering. A combination of these two (as well as the fog bank from which the Acheron was able to launch its attack) and the ship and crew are saved. Broken but not yet destroyed, Aubrey and his crew set out to find the Acheron while making repairs as they go.<br /><br />With this adrenaline rush completed for the viewer, we are now offered a glimpse into the real life that was found at sea. The daily routine of making sure the ship was taken care of, the talking between the ships crew that eventually leads to the death of one of the officers, the camaraderie of the crew who would follow their captain to hell and back and yet would never consider sharing more than a cursory glance at the officers. These were two separate classes brought together for a common cause, but that never made them friends.<br /><br />And yet when a kind word or situation presents itself, it is offered. The deeds and misdeeds of those on board bring about a closeness between this group and they rise to the task before them.<br /><br />Not only does this story present itself (more in visual deed than in word), the observations of the ship's doctor, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) towards his friend and commander are seen. The pair shares an interest in classical musicianship and an interest in the crew. But while Aubrey feels the need for battle and to rid the seas of his countries enemy, Maturin takes the more intellectual approach, voicing his opinion that rest is needed, that time should be taken rather than pursue the Acheron. Some might see this as a metaphor for the recent battles in Congress over the war in Iraq. That could be said. But I saw this more as the question that all men ask before launching into war. And the answers are never simple nor easily made.<br /><br />There is an underlying complexity to the character of Aubrey that Crowe brings forth. While he longs to face his enemy and to win, he also cares deeply for his ship and for its crew. His desire to win may cause him to make a wrong decision now and then, but deep down he would never put his men in the face of danger if he were not convinced he could save them.<br /><br />A final face off is inevitable but to reveal who wins would not only be a tremendous spoiler but would take away the effect it has on the viewer. Suffice to say that the movie truly never quite has an ending. But in a good way, not a "here we go again" one.<br /><br />The movie depicts the life of a sailor in these times in more realistic fashion than any movie I've seen before. While we are usually given old sea faring gents, this one shows us a combination of men who have no where else to go mingling with young lads who long for adventure. The range of ages was exactly that in those days.<br /><br />While a single hole in a ship meant a fast sinking vessel in most movies, this one shows that repairs could be and were made. The ships were not that easy to down. But it also allows us to see the damage caused by the cannonballs that slammed hard into the ship, inflicting more human damage than they could to the ship.<br /><br />While a sobering look at sea warfare, the movie also has its lighter moments. It also offers a testament to the human spirit as well. But most importantly it offers us something sorely lacking in today's world, something that has bothered me tremendously. It offers us a hero. A steadfast man capable of making mistakes but owning up to them and then rallying his troops to face off against a common enemy. The world lacks heroes these days. Perhaps we will only find them in film. But at least a new generation will have the chance to have that hero.</p></body></html>

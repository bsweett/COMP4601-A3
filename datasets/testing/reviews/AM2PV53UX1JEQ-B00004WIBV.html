Though major - and sometimes crazy - liberties are taken with the original legend,  this movie surely delivers a rush of spooky delights, and Johnny Depp, in a  mannered and winning performances, is delightful.  The charging horses  through the fog of an impossibly scary/beautiful forest make your heart  pound, though the movie is not as memorable as some other Burton creations  (Nightmare/Christmas; Edward Scissorhands).  Definitely not for the faint  of heart, and certainly not for the youngsters -- the gore is in your face;  and given the storyline, there are many, many beheadings, all done with the  amplified sound effects of a sharp blade slashing through the base of one's  skull.</p></body></html>

Magic is a favorite theme of writers, actors, and film makers for the obvious reason that this craft so closely parallels their own, the spinning of illusion to make audiences forget for a moment what a dull, hard place the world can be by believing, however briefly, in something that is patently false.  It is a very participatory act, the engagement of the audience in the implausible construct is essential - indeed; that is where the "magic" resides.<br /><br />Almost without fail these movies make great sport of showing how performers fool their audiences, and one another; and their directors like to demonstrate that they too are magicians.  All this can lead to layer upon layer of falsehood, deception, trickery, and even confusion.  The Prestige is no exception.  At times one wishes for a scorecard, and the plodding of the plot gets a bit murky in the middle.  But there's enough intrigue to hold you for the big finish, and The Prestige keeps you guessing literally until the final seconds.<br /><br />One look at the cast tells you that somebody spent some serious money to put together a quality film.  Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Scarlett Johansson lead the way - all are excellent although Bale struggles with his Cockney accent.  London in the late 1800's is masterfully recreated, no small trick in its own right.  But what fuels this wonderful film is rivalry and hate, a grudge between two former friends and colleagues that just keeps going and going until it is no longer mere antagonism but the very reason for living - for them both.  For us, living over a century later, it may be hard to identify with two performers who would stop at nothing to claim the title of, "England's Greatest Magician".  Seems like wanting to be Denmark's Greatest Mime.  But magic is power, and a century ago, it was possible to hold an entire audience in the palm of your hand, if you had the right Prestige.<br /><br />Worth watching more than once, just so you can try to figure out how they did it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful movie!"></head><body><p>I don't know if it's because I grew up in Michigan during the 60's or what, but from the first note from the "Dreamettes", I was hooked!  This movie has great music, wonderful performances, and tremendous energy.  It's the story of a trio of young women from Detroit and how they made it to the big time.  It tells of their days as backup singers for James Early (Eddie Murphy) to their promotion as a group by manager Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx).  It chronicles them falling in and out of love with self-centered, ambitious men who are only looking out for themselves.  When Jennifer Hudson sings "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" the world stands still and the viewer feels all the pain of a young woman being betrayed in her love life and her career.  This is a fast-paced, totally absorbing movie and I highly recommend it!</p></body></html>

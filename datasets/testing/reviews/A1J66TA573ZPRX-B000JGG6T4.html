<meta name="summary" content="Amazing movie"></head><body><p>This is a really good movie.  Even though its very slow paced.  Its still worth the 2 hours and 26 minutes.  Theres alot of action in this movie.  It is also a touching story between Creasy and Pita.  Very powerful and very touching.  Powerful performances by Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, and Dakota Fanning.  Radha Mitchell is hot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Did cowboys talk this way?"></head><body><p>Don't know. Duvall &amp; Costner seem to be too smart to be free range cowboys. They seemed to be very 21st century to me but no manner. Costner puts his money where his heart is &amp; I repect the projects he's done. The production values are always there &amp; not cheap. He can tell &amp; I guess he figures his customers can also. Westerns have changed over the years but this one has things in common with the oldies, such as justice redemption, gunplay a little romance. Annette Benning is a delightful diversion from the all male cast. A very good western for our times. Sure, I recommend it.</p></body></html>

But this is a surpringly watchable movie. Humor, cruelty, and cruel humor in its sharp, witty dialogue keep it moving. Warm, too, and not always as predictable as a typical review might make it seem. At times, it tries to be more than it is, such as when waxing philosophical about "the upside of anger," but generally it's just a strikingly realistic portrayal of some less than perfect characters and how they interact. Dark comedy is my favorite kind, and it's pretty obvious everyone involved in this project gave it their best.</p></body></html>

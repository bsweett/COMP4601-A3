<meta name="summary" content="JOHN FRANKENHEIMERs Masterpiece"></head><body><p>This is director John Frankenheimer's classic masterpiece of filmmaking. The mesmerizing story of a political and psychological subterfuge is devastating. This is one of Frank Sinatra's finest performances (he has always been underrated as an actor in my opinion) as is Laurence Harvey's (also underrated and somewhat forgotten over time). David Amram's score is prophetically apt. This is a personal favorite of mine. The images (the deck of cards, Henry Silva's unique appearance, the garden party sequences), situations and dialogue have remained with me ever since I saw it on its initial release. This is incredible filmmaking.</p></body></html>

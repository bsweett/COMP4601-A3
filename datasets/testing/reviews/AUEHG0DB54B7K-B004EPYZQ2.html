The trailers didn't look very interesting and what convinced me to see the movie were comments I heard on the radio. A comment that I recalled was that the first half of the film was like a Steven Spielberg movie (not surprising, as he was a producer) with the second half like a Jerry Bruckheimer action movie.  I came away feeling the film was an excellent tribute to Mr. Spielberg.<br /><br />The story is set in a small suburb in 1979 and focuses of a group of movie-making kinds (much like Spielberg and writer-director J. J. Abrams themselves) who are making a zombie film.  The characters have their own deep conflicts centering on the death of Joel Lamb's mother (sensitively acted by Joel Courtney). Joel's father, a deputy sheriff (Kyle Chandler providing an excellent performance) has a strong dislike for one of his deceased wife's co-workers Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard). This causes problems in a budding romance between for Joel and Alice Dainard (beautifully played by Elle Fanning).  Everything changes when the kids observe a train derailment, documented on their Super 8 camera that allows an alien creature to escape.<br /><br />The feel of the movie was closer to ET for me with the kids knowing more than the adults and knowing what needs to happen once they have all the facts about what is going on.  This is a beautifully acted film with some excellent special effects that add to the viewing experience without being gratuitous.  I think Super 8 is the kind of film that can be enjoyed more when seen the second or third times.  It is fun to watch and the details of the story and the performances can be appreciated when watched again.</p></body></html>

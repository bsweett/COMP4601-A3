<meta name="summary" content="NOT AS SHARP AS THE FIRST SAW"></head><body><p>I was a bit disappointed in this sequel to the blockbuster Saw.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than the vast majority of movies in the horror genre, but I was not blown away by it as I expected, I figured out the twist early in the movie.  Wahlberg is very good as is Tobin Bell, honestly, if you get even descent acting in movies like this, it needs to be appreciated, verdad?  The ways Jigsaw comes up with to torture his victims is inspired is suppose, but i really didnt like the setting, it looked like a tacky stage set, I just kept thinking, wow the producers must make so much money of these films because they spend a buck fifty on the sets and all the no name, mostly very bad actors, I especially disliked the female cop, she was awful and the dumb Morequa that played the narcotics dealer, I mean where the F do they find these people?..overall, NOT as good as the first, but still recommended if you are into this sort of thing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of my favorite movies of all time"></head><body><p>The movie picks up as it goes. With tons of running and such, it doesn't slow down.<p>Basically Harrison Ford is running from the law. I remember seeing it a little while ago on tv, where at the end I was on edge. The problem is that you need the great sound and picture to make it truly great.<p>Anyways, when I first saw it many years ago, I liked it. But then I realized how cool it was when I saw some of it on tv.<br />The movie is really good though. Harrison Ford plays a great guy, but hes on the run. I never really hated any of the characters until the end. Still, the movie is highly entertaining.<p>His bus tips over, and he runs. He gets chased around sewers, streets, and sidewalks. Eventually, the ending comes. Once the ending came I really wanted it to keep going but, the movie is one of those things that I can't do justice with in words. Go see it. Action and Suspense, BOoyAka!</p></body></html>

As Gaiman is well known to pen creepy childrens' stories, this one renders wonderfully as a moving picture.  In a decidedly grim parallel, Coraline goes down her own rabbit hole, to find that predictable, boring life with her parents isn't so bad.  The story is one I definitely will enjoy watching repeatedly.<br /><br />However, the 3D version of this film at home was a lackluster experience.  The perspective was slightly off and only a few fleeting times did it gel correctly to actually convey a 3D effect.  For all its artistic quality the 3D version falls short and could easily detract from the splendor of the story.  Stick to the 2D version.</p></body></html>

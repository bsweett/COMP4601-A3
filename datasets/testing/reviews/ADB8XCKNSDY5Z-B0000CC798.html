<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good"></head><body><p>I saw this movie a long time ago, so I forgot a lot of it.  Still, I remember liking it whenever I left the theater, and I'm a tough audience, so that should say something.<br /><br />The special effects are good obviously.  So if you only watch movies for good special effects, you're set already.  I don't remember the plot at all, but it must not have been too dull since I never wanted to leave the theater at any point until the end.  Still, the plot must be forgettable since I forgot it.<br /><br />There were some memorable characters though.  Magneto is pretty darn memorable, all locked up inside that non-metal cell, killing that guard by pulling a bunch of iron filling out of him.  I remember this weird mental mutant too, that just sat in a wheelchair the whole time and invaded others' thoughts.  It was pretty creepy.  My favorite character though was that evil blue shapeshifting chick.  I had a few impure thoughts about her at certain points throughout the film.  Heck, I even thought she was hot in her original form.  She's got a good figure.<br /><br />I also remember a movie spoiler: one of the X-men died.  I remember which one too, but I won't say.<br /><br />All in all, good enough to watch, but not great enough to remember.</p></body></html>

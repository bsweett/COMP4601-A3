If you want to know the entire plot, read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.<br /><br />I find Rear Window (1954) to be entertaining, fun, suspenseful, and a little scary at times all rolled into one.  The biggest reason why I like this movie is because Grace Kelly is in it.  She was a looker and her performance in this movie was Oscar-worthy.  She plays the role of Lisa Carol Fremont, who is the girlfriend of L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries, played by Jimmy Stewart.  Stewart's performance was also great.  Grace Kelly reminds me so much of Nicole Kidman, or should I say that Nicole Kidman reminds me of Grace Kelly.  Kidman's overall look she had in The Others (2001) is so similar to Kelly's look in Rear Window, especially during the early part of Rear Window.  Kidman's character name coincidentally in The Others is Grace Stewart.<br /><br />This movie takes place entirely in an apartment complex where the rear windows of all apartments are open and expose what is going on inside each apartment that overlooks a courtyard.  It's funny to watch Jimmy Stewart's character take part in voyeurism.  But his voyeurism pays off as he and several people are able to solve a murder that took place in an apartment across the courtyard.  The suspense builds as the movie progresses.<br /><br />This DVD is in widescreen format.  The extras are excellent.  There is a documentary called Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a Hitchcock Classic, which describes the making of the movie with interviews with cast and crew, Hitchcock himself through an audio interview, and Hitchcock's daughter.  It also shows how the movie was restored.  Also included is a featurette with screenwriter John Michael Hayes.  Other extras include production photographs, the theatrical trailer, a re-release trailer narrated by Jimmy Stewart, production notes, cast and filmmakers, and access to the original script.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies.  I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

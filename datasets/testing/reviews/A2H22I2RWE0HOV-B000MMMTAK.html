<meta name="summary" content="Borat!  Simply Hysterical!!!!!"></head><body><p>Borat is hysterical.  I haven't laughed that much in a movie theatre in years.  Distinct.  Disgusting.  Filled with the most politically incorrect topics one could find.  Incredible!<br /><br />All shot as a faux documentary, Borat is supposed to be the 4th most famous person in all of Kazakhstan, coming to the US and A to learn how to improve his country's cultural learnings.  After falling in love with CJ on Baywatch, Borat convinces his producer companion to leave NYC in search of California (and Pamela Anderson) so that they might cross the US and A and find real culture. Armed with his vial of gypsy tears to ward off evil, a wild bear, and a dilapidated ice cream truck, the two companions from Kazakhstan head west.  What ensues is comedic blasphemy to the point of needing an oxygen bottle to maintain consciousness; because you will laugh yourself into asphyxia.<br /><br />Shot for real cheap.  The producers of this film scored a hit and scored hard.  As for the controversy and all that.  I'll say this: No one is holding a gun to your head to watch this!!  Right?  Gawd!  People are so f*cking uptight nowadays!  Get a clue.  This is the most tongue-in-cheek movie ever made!  There are no boundries.  And the most hysterical thing is that most of the people in this movie (supposedly) had no idea that it wasn't real.  That is the sheer genius of Borat.  They took real people, put them into uncomfortable situations, and watched the results.  Most people aren't very nice when they're nudged in the wrong direction and Borat proves that.  If people can't take a joke, f*ck them!  There are far too many other attrocities going on in the world to be wasting time protesting a movie.<br /><br />Borat is obviously not going to be for everyone, but if you want to laugh yourself hoarse and you have a somewhat open-minded sense of humor, buy it right now.  You won't be disappointed.  The deleted scenes are hysterical too.<br /><br />DIG IT!!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good, But With Flaws"></head><body><p>Maybe it was all of the hype that this movie has as baggage, but I just don't think of this movie as better than the Godfather (and there are people that do). Don't get me wrong, I thought it was really good, but it has some problems. I couldn't believe the continuity problems this movie has. For example, when Ray Liota is in prison, his kid's toy blocks keep appearing and disappearing or they are in different positions. That is just one scene, and I can remember at least two other times when it happens. It is just really distracting and pulls me out of the movie. The movie also has some slow spots and is best during the second act. Overall, a good film, but I actually like Casino more than I liked this movie.</p></body></html>

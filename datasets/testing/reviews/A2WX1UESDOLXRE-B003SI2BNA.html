I don't care about that sort of thing, I'll make my own judgment, but I was aware. And guess what?? How right the critics are this time! Wow! I'll say it simply -- this is not a very good movie. The events unfold well enough to give you seriously creepy feelings, but in the end, I wished I hadn't put in nearly 100 minutes of my time watching something that was truly mediocre.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly stars as Dahlia, a woman who is dealing with an icky divorce as well as an icky custody battle involving her only child, an adorable little girl named Cecilia. Dahlia and Cecilia move into a new apartment, an inredibly nasty apartment with a terrible leak problem. And this isn't just regular water. It's DARK water. Ooooo!! Spooky! Eventually we learn that the apartment above her own was lived in by a family of three. They, too, had a little girl, right at Cecilia's age. Meanwhile, Cecilia's teacher is concerned because she keeps talking to an imaginary friend named Natasha. You guessed it -- Natasha is also the name of girl who once lived above them. So obviously we have a ghost on our hands.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal to much, just in case you actually want to see this drek and be surprised for yourself. You won't so much be surprised as you will be bewildered. Why does Dahlia do that?? Come on! Why does she give in?? I realize that you have no clue what I'm talking about, but, well, you'll see eventually. Check this out if your looking to be creeped out. Certainly not as good as The Ring, not quite as "okay" as The Grudge, but still perhaps worth taking a look at.</p></body></html>

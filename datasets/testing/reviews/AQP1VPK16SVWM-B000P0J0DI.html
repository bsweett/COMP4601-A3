<meta name="summary" content="One of Eastwood's best films as director and star"></head><body><p>Redemption can only succeed if the past doesn't haunt the redeemed. Clint Eastwood stars as former outlaw Will Munny. Munny has changed his ways after meeting a woman who literally helped him turn his life around. Now she's gone and he's a struggling farmer with two small children desperate for money to fuel his last chance at staying honest and straight. <p>Munny decides along with his former partner (a marvelously understated Morgan Freeman)and a young kid to kill two cowboys that cut up a prostitute for a $1000.00 bounty. The only thing standing between him and the money is Little Bill (Gene Hackman who picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting actor)a brutal Sheriff. Munny doesn't know it but he's caught an express train to hell as the cold blooded killer he was comes to the fore again.<p>Unforgiven is as much about the inability to escape our past as it is about the violence and bloodshed that was later glossed over in the westerns of the 30's and 40's. Munny realizes that killing is a nasty business for both the killer and his victim. Despite his years of hard work and the saving grace of his wife, Munny could easily tip over into the abyss of alcholism and cruelty that dominated his youth. It's a marvelous portrayal and Eastwood, arguably, deserved the Best Acting Oscar as much as the directing and Best Picture Oscars.<p>This new 10th Anniversary edition has been digitally remastered and looks beautiful. The opening sequence is a good example of the care taken in the transfer. The smoke from Munny's house during sunset snakes gently against the bright orange sky. Eastwood and his collaborators (writer David Webb Peoples who also wrote Blade Runner and the underrated film science fiction adventure Solider with Kurt Russell)have fashioned a morality play as much about the present as it is about the past. <p>The cast is filled with Eastwood regulars but two particular performances shine aside from Eastwood and Freeman--Gene Hackman as the sadistic and brutal Little Bill and the late Richard Harris in a glorified cameo as gunfighting legend English Bob. Harris plays Bob as a dandy with a pistol until Bob encounters Little Bill. We then discover how much of his legend is myth designed to gloss over a nasty reputation and dishonorable actions.<p>The extras included are very good as well. There's a documentary called Eastwood on Eastwood which ran on one of the cable channels.  As a performer we get glimpses of Eastwood in early supporting roles (from his first movie the horrible horror film Revenge of the Creature with John Agar)to the television role that gave him enough fame to jump to Leone's A Fistful of Dollars in Rawhide. The clips provide a good summation of Eastwood's performing style over the years. It's also a canny if slightly self serving assessment on Eastwood's themes as a director and smart observations about the true quality of his uneven body of work as a director. <p>There's also an episode of Maverick featuring James Garner where Eastwood plays a character that could have been Munny when he was younger. He plays a cocky young gunfighter with an attitude (although Munny was much nastier based on comments from the characters in the film. Consider his portrayal a G rated version of Munny). It's a beautiful transfer of a classic black and white episode from television's Golden Age. When will Maverick and some of these classic westerns finally make the jump to DVD?<p>There's also a feature commentary by Time film critic Richard Schickel (although I would have much preferred Eastwood). A new featurette about the making of the film as well as the original featurette on the making of the film. <p>If you're not interested in the extras and the nearly pristine transfer doesn't appeal to you, the single disc earlier edition of Unforgiven looks very good as well athough nowhere near as sharp as this one. It's about half the cost and might be a good place to start if you haven't seen the film and are unsure about purchasing it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Quite good and tough"></head><body><p>This is a simple piece of entertainment, that with the exception of a few key scenes you would never guess has anything to with Marvel Comics, unless you have read them. The plot as outlined many times before is that special forces guy Frank Castle kills a gangsters son in his last mission and the Gangster (John Travolta) attempts to kill all of Castles family as well as him in revenge. Castle survives and seeks his own revenge.<br /><br />Its reasonable well done, and certainly entertaining. I was particularly fond of Castles relationship with his oddball neighbours and the loyalty that they both show to each other in the end. However in my view it was let down by a slightly wooden performance from Thomas Jane in the leading role. I never really believed in him... I could imagine this role being done very well by Hugh Jackman. Naturally John Travolta is good in his role.<br /><br />Look out for Kevin Nash, an ex professional wrestler as "The Russian" who is almost a foot taller then The Punisher!</p></body></html>

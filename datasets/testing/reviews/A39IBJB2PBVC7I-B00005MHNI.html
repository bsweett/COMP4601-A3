If nothing else, Kubrick was a masterful stylist with a wonderful eye for composition and detail.  Wildly controversial when it debuted, the film continues to spark heated debate, even among Kubrick admirers.  Clockwork Orange was condemned for its graphic depiction of senseless violence, but screen violence of this sort is common today.  There are two reasons why this chilling masterpiece still has the power to unnerve audiences; the first reason has to do with Alex, the protagonist, the second with the broader implications of the movie's snarling social satire.<br /><br />Alex is not your garden-variety thug.  He adores Beethoven, he's intelligent, articulate, and capable of being charming.  More to the point, we don't get the sense that his pathology is the result of a wretched childhood or societal abuse - he simply delights in violence and cruelty, they make him happy.  The unforgettable "Singin' In The Rain" scene makes this point most emphatically, and tragically.  In this regard, Alex (played masterfully by Malcolm McDowell), is less a symbol of modern society than of man's inherently violent nature, celebrated every day around the world both directly and indirectly through innumerable well-respected rituals.  In short, Alex is especially horrifying because he is, if not likable, certainly familiar.<br /><br />The second is the allegorical nature of the film.  (Viewers determined to critique the movie literally are reminded that Alex has his own language.  The headline of this review, translated from Alex-speak, would read Great Story, No Apology.) Especially in the Burgess novel, but also here, we are invited to consider the moral consequences of a society's decision to use brainwashing and torture as a means of curing its violence-management problem.  Kubrick makes it easy to spot this ethical dilemma by having some of the droogs turn up in police uniforms, thus inviting the question, how does one tell the criminals from the good guys without a score card?<br /><br />Years after its release, Clockwork Orange holds its own.  As entertainment it is tough sledding but fascinating.  As art it is triumphant.  In art we look not for answers but for the right questions.  Clockwork Orange shines a very bright light on some fascinating and fundamental moral mysteries that go right to the heart of being human - brilliant then, brilliant now.  Belongs in any collection of important film.</p></body></html>

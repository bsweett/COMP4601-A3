<meta name="summary" content="Boy, Does This Film Hold Up To Test Of Time!"></head><body><p>I've seen this film at least five times prior to seeing it again last night.  It is as fresh and as perfect as the day it was made and I enjoyed every moment again.  It seems every actor in it became either a major film or tv star in the years after it was made 25 years ago. Robert DeNiro is at his finest as Travis Bickel, a New York taxi driver, who slips further and further into a breakdown state. He can't sleep so drives his cab all night long. He runs into an amazing cast of characters on the city's streets including Jodie Foster, a teenage prostitute who has Harvey Keitel as her pimp; Cybill Shepard as the idealized woman he wants to court (his idea of a date is taking her to a porno movie!); Albert Brooks as a political worker; Peter Boyle as a fellow cabbie; director Martin Scorsese in a cameo role as an obsessed husband watching his wife carry on an affair from the back of Travis's cab.  The soundtrack I've had for years too as it is the most gorgeous saxophone accompaniment.  Perhaps the most perfect aspect that struck me this time though was the writing.  Paul Schaefer's screenplay was dead on.  He grabbed ahold of Travis Bickel's paranoid, alienated world and delivered it dead-on to us.  If only other film-makers understood the need to start with an absolutely first rate script, perhaps more films would be winners like this one too.</p></body></html>

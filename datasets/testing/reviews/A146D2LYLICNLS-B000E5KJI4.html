<meta name="summary" content="Works as entertainment, but not much else"></head><body><p>Upon seeing the trailer for this movie I had expected a lot more than what was delivered. This is simply an average movie in every aspect. I actually like Brad Pitt as an actor; he can do a good job when he is cast for the right movie (ie: "12 Monkeys and "Se7en"). But I'm sorry, he was unconvincing as Achilles. Yeah, he obviously spent some major time at the gym for this role and admittedly he looks impressive physically. But in terms of *emotion* and acting in the role he leaves much to be desired.<p>The fight scenes are mediocre at best and become repetitive after the first one. Both armies stare each other down-run towards each other while screaming-collide-throats are slashed and chests are impaled (one very large fighter needs to be impaled twice before he dies, just for the added shock value and drama)-armies retreat and lick their wounds-Brad Pitt is shown all sweaty and covered in the blood of the men he killed-Brad Pitt washes himself (one almost expects him to turn to the camera, hold up a bottle of the newest shampoo and start talking about how it leaves your hair silky smooth without any buildup)-army sleeps while Brad Pitt gets a little action-next day another battle. Repeat as necessary throughout the movie.<p>But I don't mean to knock the battle sequences all that much. The fight between Achilles and Hector is great, and might very well be worth the price of admission. Pitt and Bana actually work at it.<p>And Diane Kruger who plays Helen of Troy is definitely gorgeous and nice to look at, even if she's a one-dimentional cardboard cutout of a character. Not her fault. Blame the film-makers for that.<p>All in all, don't expect much from this movie other than mild entertainment. It's all style and little substance. For a much better viewing experience of a movie in the same genre watch "Gladiator." That leaves "Troy" in the dust.</p></body></html>

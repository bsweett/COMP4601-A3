<meta name="summary" content="Good movie and a worthy addition to the Superman sagas"></head><body><p>I was skeptical when I found out that they were planning to do another movie on Superman.  First of all, I thought why would they want to continue the sagas without Christopher Reeve?  I remember watching Superman in 1978 and Superman II in 1980 and thinking that nothing else could ever top those movies (especially with the disapointment of Superman III and Quest for Peace).  I thought that they have done enough and just leave the series alone.<br /><br />When I went to see this one, I was happily suprised to find that they used the music from the original sagas and that they didn't try to outdo the original series but pay homage to them and tell a different account of Superman.  Brandon Routh is a great Superman (unfortunately it will leave him typecast for the rest of his career), Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is excellent (and she is so SEXY!), and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther was great (wouldn't it been fun to see Gene Hackman as Lex Luther Sr.?) Anyways, great special effects, a good plot the story, and believeable characters.  I think Christopher Reeve would of been pleased with this rendition of Superman.<br /><br />Recommended!</p></body></html>

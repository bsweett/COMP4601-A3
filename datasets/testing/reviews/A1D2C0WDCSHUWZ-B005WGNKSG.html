<meta name="summary" content="The girl in the bloody thriller"></head><body><p>"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" sounds more like a kung-fu movie than a Swedish thriller.  But a Swedish thriller it is.<br /><br />And the film adapted from the late Stieg Larsson's first bestselling novel is a soon-to-be-classic example of a movie that has way more going on than it appears. It's a bit on the slow side at times, but it also has a raw, stark quality that hits you harder than any Hollywood blockbuster could -- and Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist are nothing short of awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from an executive.<br /><br />Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger, to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece, Harriet. She vanished forty years ago from the family's isolated island home, and her body -- alive or dead -- was never found.  When Mikael agrees to take the case, he's cybershadowed by the abused goth hacker Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace).<br /><br />Eventually Lisbeth reveals herself to Mikael by decoding vital information and sending it to him. Intrigued by this strange wounded woman, Mikael asks her to help him in his cold-case investigation, and the two begin unwinding a bizarre string of serial killings from long ago -- all tied to Bible quotes. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried.<br /><br />"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" takes the Agatha Christie aesthetic of a locked-room murder with a dozen suspects, and enfolds it in a ruthless look at modern Swedish society and the study of sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the long-missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry "girl with the dragon tattoo."<br /><br />And it translates Larsson's novel beautifully -- there's a raw, almost primitive power to the story, under all the snow and icy Swedish landscape. Niels Arden Oplev gives the movie a sort of stark wild beauty, but also weaves in some horribly disturbing scenes (the ghastly, helpless rape of Lisbeth by her corrupt "guardian" -- followed by a gleefully horrific scene where she gets her revenge). And the murder mystery is absolutely brilliant, especially when Lisbeth unravels Harriet's code.<br /><br />And Mikael and Salander make an intriguing odd couple -- Nyquist's journalist is worn and weary of the world, and both the Harriet case and meeting Lisbeth rekindle his interest in the truth. And Rapace is absolutely electric as Lisbeth, who is one of the most devastatingly brilliant characters in modern cinema -- she's a wild, bleeding creature who hides her bruises behind a mask of piercings and jet-dyed hair, and whose torn-up heart begins to heal a little when she meets Mikael.<br /><br />"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" is blessed with brilliant direction, powerful acting, and a stark look at the way women are treated by cruel men. Not a light movie, but definitely a classic in the making.</p></body></html>

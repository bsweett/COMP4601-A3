It's a straight horror film that works far more on atmosphere than actual jumps (though the fan of jump moments will certainly get a few in here), the kind of thing that, as with extreme horror, has had America lagging about a decade behind Japan's horror film industry. Thank your lucky stars, however, that an enterprising group finally landed a deal with Universal, because The Skeleton Key is good stuff, one of the better pieces of horror celluloid to come out of Hollywood in a lot of years.<br /><br />The story concerns Caroline Ellis (Almost Famous' Kate Hudson, who as she gets older looks more and more like Jill Hennessy-- and this is a good thing), a young hospice care worker, disillusioned with the state-run home she's been working for. She accepts a private job about an hour outside New Orleans caring for Ben (John Hurt, absent from horror films for far too long), who had a stroke about a month before she comes on the scene. Ben's wife Violet (Gena Rowlands) doesn't take to Caroline at first; it takes the intervention of the family lawyer, Luke (Peter Sarsgaard, of Jarhead and Boys Don't Cry fame), to convince Caroline to stay on. By the time weird things start happening in the famously haunted house, Caroline has already grown too attached to Ben to leave.<br /><br />The movie is not without its shortcomings, which cannot be revealed without spoilers, but which will be readily obvious to most viewers starting about three-quarters of the way through the film. They are not, however, enough to counterbalance the movie's wonderfully-done atmosphere, fine performances by all main cast members, and a general sense of foreboding. Even better, you'll be spending a couple of hours after the movie sporadically stopping and saying "oh, so THAT's what that scene was about!"<br /><br />A fine piece, and well worth watching. *** ?</p></body></html>

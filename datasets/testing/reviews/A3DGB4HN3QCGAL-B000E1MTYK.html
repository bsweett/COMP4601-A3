<meta name="summary" content="Not bad, darker tone than past movies in series"></head><body><p>It's been four years since I've read the book so I can't say for sure how close the movie kept to the text. I think they probably did a pretty good job considering the amount of material that had to be trimmed out.<br /><br />If you don't mind the darker tone to the movie (much more serious, and was the weather so overcast all the time in Potter 1-3?)it is pretty good, lots of action and adventure- might not be exactly like the book. It's more violent and some of the characters do more swearing than in the other movies (I think the later books are that way too). It's a good adaptation.</p></body></html>

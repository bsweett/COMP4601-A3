<meta name="summary" content="An epic that went into the pages of history"></head><body><p>After the Mad Max and the Lethal Weapon series, and a very funny co-starring of Maverick with Jodie Foster, Mel Gibson brought this brilliant movie to life as director and actor. <p> The movie revolves around the epic character of William Wallace, a man who led the Scottish in their struggle against the English. Filled with love and battles, there are very few movie endings that remain so strong in my memory. <p> To top things, Gibson brought on board thousand wars veteran James Horner to put together a unique soundtrack to go with the story. <p> You can't get it wrong. This is one of history's most beautiful and heroic tales.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A stupid story line but it's overall cute"></head><body><p>Ok this is a chick flick so we all know stuff like this will not happen in real life. The story it self is pretty stupid a good looking guy is still living at home who happnds to be 35. The premise is very stupid as if that would ahppen it dose but did you see what he looks like. There are cheap laughs but through out the film. The good thing is the chemistry is great and Sarah jessica Parker is lovely. the film has funny moments and it's good if you turn your mind off. When the film is over you think was it good or bad but it falls on trhe border line of good and bad, but it was enjoyable.</p></body></html>

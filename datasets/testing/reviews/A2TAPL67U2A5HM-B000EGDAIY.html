<meta name="summary" content="The Grudge  ~ Sarah Michelle Gellar"></head><body><p>The Grudge~ Sarah Michelle Gellar is a totally amazing horror movie. This movie freaked me out and I was like shaking with fear when I saw some of the scenes. This movie is just as good as the ring, and the eye. The acting is stupendous and what truly scares you is what you do not see and then your imagination runs totally wild and sets you up for some seriously demented ideas. The special effects are great. I am left with an unsettling feeling in my gut and that is exactly what a good horror movie should do. SMG is amazing in her role as is Bill Pulman in his short part. I highly recommend this movie to people that like horror movies but for the weak of heart this can be a bit too frightening.</p></body></html>

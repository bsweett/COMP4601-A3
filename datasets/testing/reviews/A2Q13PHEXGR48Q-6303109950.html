<meta name="summary" content="Excellent western with great cast"></head><body><p>Tombstone is the retelling of Wyatt Earp and his involvement in the city before and after the famous gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  The movie begins with Earp trying to start over and forget his past in the mining town of Tombstone.  The Cowboy gang holds a stranglehold on the town that cannot be broken.  Before long, Earp and his two brothers must strap on their guns once again to clean things up.  This may be a familiar story, but it is anything but.  An impressive cast, excellent action, and even some humor makes this western fully enjoyable.<p> While Kurt Russell is excellent as Marshal Wyatt Earp, Val Kilmer steals the show as dying gunman Doc Holliday.  His performance is truly great and should have earned him an Academy Award for his performance.  Even as tuberculosis takes its toll on him, he remains the same hard drinking, card playing gunfighter that he always was.  The relationship between the two men is fully believable and one of the better points of the movie.  Michael Biehn and Powers Boothe are also excellent as Johnny Ringo and Curley Bill, the leaders of the Cowboy gang.  The fantastic supporting cast includes Dana Delaney, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Stephen Lang, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestley, Robert Burke, Joanna Pacula, Michael Rooker, and Billy Zane.  As well, look for old western star Harry Carey JR as the marshal of Tombstone.  The Vista Series DVD is loaded full of extras which are all very good.  The best may be the deleted scenes that are included.  At times during the movie, it seems a bit choppy with editing, but the movie is still very good.  For fans of westerns check out this action-filled western!</p></body></html>

The film is "based on a true story" and the accompanying documentary on the DVD makes you believe that the director/writer Andrew Niccol did his homework.  Most of the weapons are cold-war leftovers that Yuri acquires from high-ranking former Soviet military officers looking for a little underhanded capitalism.<br /><br />Jared Leto is featured as Yuri's brother Vitaly and Bridget Moynahan is beautifully believable as Yuri's trophy bride Ava Fontaine.  Ian Holm is very effective as an "old school" arms dealer who first dismisses the upstart Yuri, then approaches him later seeking a partnership.  Eamonn Walker is chilling as the militaristic dictator of Liberia - a nation that was supposed to be founded as a home for descendents of former slaves, now turned into a perpetual high-stakes gang war.  Ethan Hawke shines in his scenes as the "honest cop", an Interpol agent who knows all of Yuri's underhanded dealings, but won't compromise his own integrity or bend the rules to bring Yuri to justice - a fact Yuri exploits more than once.<br /><br />It's not easy watching a film in which the lead character is such a scumbag outlaw, but Cage brings such an easy-going larger-than-life charm to Yuri that you're able to overlook his significant "character flaw" to get through the film.  I remember feeling something similar watching the gangsters in the "Godfather" films.</p></body></html>

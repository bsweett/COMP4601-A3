<meta name="summary" content="Study at Rick's School of Management and Behavioral Science"></head><body><p>For me, the intriguing story of _Casablanca_ is not the story of Rick and Ilsa trapped between the reality of their present and the memory of their past.  <p>No, the truly interesting  story of _Casablanca_ is that which is  revealed in the DVD's supplementary documentary, _You Must Remember This_.  The creation of this true work of art in an environment dedicated to the  mass production of films gives hope to every artist who's had to perform  commercially.  Indeed, one almost comes away from a behind-the-scenes  exploration of _Casablanca_ with an actual appreciation of the way in which  deadlines and pressure can help the artist make a better product.  <p>_You  Must Remember This_ is thus useful for its display of  the whole  &quot;studio system&quot; era in Hollywood.  It gives a good glimpse into  that time and could serve as a useful jumping-off point to anyone seriously  studying the subject.<p>Likewise, the way in which the film's producers and  director led the project is a fascinating exploration of management  science.  The film became legendary, I think, because the people at the top  allowed great flexibility for those they led, and weren't afraid to play  around with ideas offered even on the studio floor.  I think MBA candidates  would do well to look at the way this film was put together for  enlightenment.<p>Still, I can't resist talking about the film itself.  For  me _Casablanca_ is the legend I return to in my own mind whenever there are  romantic crises in my life.  I think that part of the reason that this  movie has survived is because it offers a unique perspective on romantic  disappointment.  Instead of concluding with scorn or hatred of partners  who've left one hanging, it says that people can have noble reasons for  causing pain.  It also says that ultimately pain is eased when one achieves  understanding of the other person.  I'm not sure that any major American  film gives such a positive spin to heartbreak as this one.  <p>It's  thus not at all hard for me to recommend the DVD version of this product,  for the excellent  supplementary documentary alone, and the movie itself,  for the surprising values it discovers in the heart of a morally ambiguous  Morocco.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The end is extremely nigh!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>This is actually a line of graffitti written on the wall of some church as depicted in the film.<br />  "28 days later" is overall a great horror film and quite possibly a classic in its genre even though it treads already stepped on ground it still has enough originality and verve in it to bring it through.<p>  As a man wakes up from a coma after a month only to find out that humans have been almost wiped out by a deadly "rage virus" that makes its victims extremely aggressive and murderous a story of ultra doom unfolds filmed masterfully by Doyle (Trainspotting).<br />  The scenes where the protagonist walks about in a deserted London where cars have been abandoned in the middle of the streets and there's no soul to be seen anywhere while screaming "helloooooo" are second to none when it comes to depicting catastrophe on celluloid.<br />  Eventually, and after being attacked by raging zombies, he figures out that while he was comatose the world has turned into an arena of murder induced by the virus. Understanding the extreme danger he's under he teams up with other non-infected survivors and they try to figure out what to do but in the mode of a blind man searching for something which he doesn't know what it looks like.<br />  The ened of the film dissapoints somewhat as the few survivors become prisoners of a near-psychosis-army-major and his few men who've set barracks somewhere in the countryside and gets further spoiled as the final scene emits out of the blue hope when the entire film actually works in showing there's no such possibility. Pity because those last 20 seconds of the closing scene are enough to take the film off its course. An ultra doom-end would not only have been very appropriate but the scenario indeed screams for an ending that leaves no hope and no light at the end of any tunnel.<p>  Strangely enough, for those that've read Stephen King's "the stand" a lot of the scenes and ideas incorporated here seem to be lifted straight off that book. They fit like a glove of course but I wonder how much of the script was inspired of that novel.<br />  Cinematically speaking it's strikingly obvious that Boyle pays hommage to classic horror directors like Romero and Carpenter. The raging zombie theme has Romero written all over it and the excellent soundtrack reminds immediately of Carpenter as does the sequence with the survivors being emprisoned in the army barracks while under literal siege which reminisces of "Assault on precinct 13"..<p>  Beautiful camera work, beautiful directing, incredible photography, brilliant soundtrack only marred by the ending of the film which should have been avoided. All the -outside Britain- actors are giving excellent performances (esp. the main character as well as the army major) and exactly the fact that they are not known faces helps make the film more believable.<br />  Along with Donnie Darko (dont miss it if you havent seen it)28 days later are easily the top indie films of last year not to metnion of the last 5 years.<br />  Great stuff and a welcome return to classic horror themes for lovers of the genre.</p></body></html>

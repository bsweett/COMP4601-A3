<meta name="summary" content="Not really a horror, but one hell of a fun ride"></head><body><p>This movie starts out with Christopher Lee talking, I honestly can't think of a better way to start a movie like this.<br /><br />So this is a fairy tale that plays out like a real movie, it's kind of hard to explain, but this movie does have  agood realism about it.<br /><br />Johhny Depp has come to town to find the headless horsmen.<br /><br />That is really all you need to know, not every scene is a classic, but the action scenes are wonderful.  The horseman is really bad-ass.  Christopher Walkien plays he horseman with a head, but looks way cooler without it.<br /><br />Some very sick moments, btu only like 1 or 2.  So the kids like 9 and over will probably be ok with this.  Overall the gore is very styleish.<br /><br />I love pretty much about this movie, except for a few scenes that I thought could have been better.  But the music was the best part for me.  It was so loud and strong, it exacted what the atmosphere looked like.  I don't know who scored it but he did an awesome job.<br /><br />The commentary is so-so, better than most.  And the making of is alright, but buy this dvd for the movie.<br /><br />VERY COOL.</p></body></html>

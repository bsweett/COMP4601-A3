<meta name="summary" content="Sean Cunningham's Friday the 13th"></head><body><p>The first Friday the 13th will go down as the turning point in the slasher genre.  John Carpenter scored big with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305546789">Halloween</a> but the slasher genre was still somewhat of an untouched subject until this movie rolled around.<br /><br />It has everything that makes it a slasher flick, teenagers, sex, blood, and horror, alongside all the killing.  A thoroughly enjoyable movie in the Friday the 13th series.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

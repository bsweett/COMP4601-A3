<meta name="summary" content="A very emotional historical drama"></head><body><p>About the first black regiment (the 54th Massachusetts) to fight for the Union in the Civil War. The movie traces its history from its creation in 1862, through its training and treatment as almost a joke by the government, and its near-annihilation in South Carolina while attacking Ft. Wagner at Charleston. Col. Robert Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick) was the commanding officer, a white man, and the usual conflicts regarding honor and duty and fairness occur under the circumstances. The soldiers are whipped into shape almost despite themselves and earn their glory under fire. Denzel Washington is excellent as a tough-as-nails one-time slave. In fact, all of the actors are so motivated in what they're doing in front of the camera that viewers can't help but be swept up with them and feel the strongest emotions. The photography is also stunning as is the attention to historical detail. Definitely worth a watch.</p></body></html>

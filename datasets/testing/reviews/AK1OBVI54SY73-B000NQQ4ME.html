<meta name="summary" content="Good But Not Great"></head><body><p>This movie definitely stands out among the other films released right now as something unique to see at least once. And it is pretty good overall- the cast is as strong as they could be and the scenes are a thing of beauty for the most part- but if I would ever watch it again...I don't think I would.<br /><br />Although the movie has its strong points that make it a success... it's just not an exciting film from beginning to end. Actually towards the end I grew bored. I don't know if it was the length of the film or my overall lack of being able to really, fully get into the entire story- but eventually the movie got to that point where I had to wonder when it's finally going to end.<br /><br />So really it's good to watch once to me, but not good enough to watch again.<br /><br />3.5/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Most Animated Corpses Around"></head><body><p>Tim Burton, one of our greatest directors, has a stunning, occasionally unsettling, visual imagination. Beetle Juice gave us a good-humored descent into the underworld while Edward Scissorhands profiled a poignant monster far kinder than the nice suburban folk he encountered. Sleepy Hollow was dark, lush, and painterly. Mars Attacks! - bright and cheery - unleashed some of the nastiest cartoon characters ever drawn. Burton's celebrated stop-motion animation efforts; The Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, and Corpse Bride showcase his uniquely graphic approach to film, to say nothing of his obsession with the macabre.<br /><br />Maybe the problem is that Burton is starting to behave like a musician who only knows one song and wanders nocturnal landscapes in search of new ways to play it. Where The Nightmare Before Christmas seemed long on visuals and short on story, Corpse Bride feels positively content-less. This is the first movie I have ever seen where I thought to myself, "You know, this would have made a much better book," something along the lines of Polar Express - huge format, gorgeous drawings, brief captions. Clocking in at an anemic 1:18, and padded out with some regrettable Danny Elfman musical numbers, Corpse Bride suffers from "less there than meets the eye" syndrome.<br /><br />The humor here rests on a slender reed indeed; the living world is dark, foreboding, and cruel while the afterlife is a regular chuckle-fest. The film's most memorable scene is a piano duet between the living Victor and the dead, and cranky, Emily - necrophilia never sounded so good! Indeed, Emily, who has retained a splendid, even opulent, figure despite being dead, seems like a better choice than the living Victoria. Of course Emily does have that chatty and annoying maggot living behind her eye that, for some reason, sounds like Peter Lorre. Because it's a cartoon, voices are important, and Helena Bonham-Carter is perfect, as always. Johnny Depp, by contrast, is unfortunately cast and struggles through his English accent unconvincingly - are all English actors currently employed?<br /><br />Wonderful eye-candy but just not enough meat on the bones.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Marvel-ous!"></head><body><p>Perfectly cast and executed tremendously with laid back ease, "Iron Man" is proof that Marvel still has what it takes to dish out the good stuff. I have to admit that I was starting to worry about the future of Marvel's films after seeing the pathetic "Spider-Man 3", "Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer", "Ghost Rider" & "Elektra", but "Iron Man" has put life into a franchise that has seemingly been going downhill, ... quality wise that is.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. has done something with his Superhero that other actors have yet to try with theirs, ... loosen up, have fun and add some humor. The screenplay does a wonderful job of adding issues that American's fear at this particular point in time, using the war on terror to make the film more realistic and envolving. Also, Jeff Bridges really does break out in the second half of the film to create quite a villianous character.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

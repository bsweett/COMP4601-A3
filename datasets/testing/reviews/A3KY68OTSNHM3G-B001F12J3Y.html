<meta name="summary" content="A Beautiful Christmas Movie for Those Who Still Believe"></head><body><p>Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis, the same team who brought us such great movies as "Forrest Gump" and "Cast Away", have teamed up again, and they deliver perhaps their best movie ever in this classic adaptation of the popular children's book.<br /><br />On Christmas Eve, a massive steam train suddenly appears in front of a boy's home.  The conductor, one of Hanks' many roles in the film, jumps off and asks if the boy is getting on.  The boy asks where the train is going.  "To the North Pole!" is the conductor's reply.  After thinking it over, the boy gets on the train and he, along with several other children are soon on their way to the North Pole to see Santa.  We are introduced to some other children along the way; a young African-American girl, a Know-It-All boy, and a shy boy.  During the course of the film, all of them become very good friends.<br /><br />As the train makes its way north, the viewer is treated to many breathtaking special effects.  The scenes where the train is going up and down the mountain passes and sliding over the frozen lake are true high points of the film.  I've never seen special effects this eye-popping before in an animated film.  They are simply superb.  Upon reaching the North Pole, the children are informed that one of them will receive the first gift of Christmas.  However, before this can happen, the children must overcome having their car come uncoupled from the rest of the train, and sliding down a long slide and ending up in Santa's bag.  Who will Santa choose to recieve the first Christmas gift?<br /><br />Having three small children, I've seen my share of animated children's films in the last few years, but none of those even come close to this tremendous film.  The story is very touching, and the visual effects are out of this world.  I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan and I watch his movies every chance I get.  His roles in this movie are some of his very best, but his role as the wise and caring conductor is perhaps his best.  Needless to say, I give this movie my highest recommendation.  As long as you can still hear the sleighbell jingle, then you'll always be a true believer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Actors Save the Day"></head><body><p>The fantastic, committed performances of the talented cast sustains this overlong episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE worth watching.  Julianne, Dominic, Linus, Alfre, Gary...even the kids...not a bad apple in the bunch.<br /><br />Two endings included to choose from, so take your pick.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the commentary track from the Writer & Director doesn't offer much behind-the-scenes insight, except to point out the distressing (and all too common) reality of how little communication and understanding existed between them during production.<br /><br />If nothing else, it's great to watch these talents actors and be reminded of the superheroic potential of that great invisible weapon: the permanent umbilicle cord that exists between mother and child!</p></body></html>

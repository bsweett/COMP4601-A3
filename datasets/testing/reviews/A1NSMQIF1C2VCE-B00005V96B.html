<meta name="summary" content="Pixar just keeps getting better"></head><body><p>While the &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies had a fairly simple story, as did &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; marks real progress for Pixar. While one expects greater technical sophistication with each film (and said expectations are always rewarded), this film also marks the first time where shades of gray creep into the story, and new heights in creativity in the setting, characters and storyline are added to the mix.<p>The three Pixar films prior to this are mostly kids' stuff, with the fun for adults being the gee whiz technical aspects (and seeing long-ago toys come to life), &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; slyly plays with adult conventions, making it a delight for audiences of all ages.<p>For younger viewers, the film may run a little long, but it's still time well-spent. The added features on the DVD are excellent as well, but are arranged in a more kid-friendly format than adult viewers might prefer, although not to the ridiculous extent present on the first Harry Potter DVD.<p>Recommended for film fans of all ages, including adults who worry that Pixar is already starting to rest on their considerable laurels.</p></body></html>

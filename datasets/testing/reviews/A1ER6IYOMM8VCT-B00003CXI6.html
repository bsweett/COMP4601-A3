Pfeiffer carries this movie for the most part and having Harrison Ford and James Remar switch their usual roles throws you off for a while, but ultimately makes you skeptical. It's a good little ghost story,but it does have a few pimples. One thing I did not like about the DVD itself is that when you put it in your DVD player it plays parts of the movie before going to the menu screen. If you are seeing the movie for the first time, skip this section as it spoils the film a little! A great homage to Hitchcock and it does have a few good scares. The DVD transfer looks very good.</p></body></html>

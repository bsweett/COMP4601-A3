Taking place in 1944 Spain, Pan's Labyrinth revolves around young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who seeks to escape the horrifying world she lives in.  Her tender mother (Ariadna Gil) is newly married and carrying the son of the cruel and blood thirsty Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), who enjoyes torturing the prisoners he captures.  Ofelia however gets a surprise upon discovering the labyrinth in the woods, which is populated by the Faun (Doug Jones, better known as the guy in the Ape Sapien suit in Del Toro's adaptation of Hellboy) who informs her that she is the re-incarnated daughter of the King of the underworld.  She is given three tasks to perform, each the more dire, until the film reaches it's startling and heart wrenching conclusion.  Despite some of the film's incredibly bloody and violent scenes, Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifuly realized film.  Del Toro's inventive direction combined with the gloomy atmosphere and brilliant make up effects are a sight to behold, and that's saying it lightly.  Be warned though that Pan's Labyrinth is not a film for all tastes, and those who don't like fairy tale elements that aren't kid tested and Disney approved will certainly not enjoy this film to say the least.  That being said though, films like Pan's Labyrinth come along all so rarely, which makes it all the more enjoyable.  The New Line Platinum Series DVD edition features a host of extras as well, and is definitely the version of the film to get.</p></body></html>

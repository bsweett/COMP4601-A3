<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Film!!!"></head><body><p>This is a great sequel that's just as awesome as the original, and highly lived up to my expectations! Everybody did an awesome job. The storyline seems a lot darker than the original. There is more comedy, emotional moments, and a lot more fighting. It's been two years since the Autobots helped Sam Witwicky defeat the Decepticons. As Sam leaves for college, he finds a piece of the Allspark, which causes him to see visions of Cybertronian symbols in his mind. Megatron is resurrected, and brings the Fallen to Earth, so they can finish what they started, and try to use the Matrix of Leadership to destroy the Sun. Optimus Prime and the rest of the Autobots must stop the Decepticons once again. I highly recommend TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="good, but the first one is better"></head><body><p>This is supposed to deepen the concept of mutant alienation and potential war, raising the stakes with ever more spectacular special effects.  I admit, from a hard sci-fi pt of view, I found this weaker than the first - it is more like magic, this "mind power" that can be bent to threaten, well, everyone.  But the acting is absolutely excellent, even moving (if a comic book ever could be), and there are fabulous moments in the film, from the violent romp of Nightcrawler in the WHite House to Magneto's ingenious and frightening escape with three balls of steel.  These things are a visual treat.  Then there is the evolution of WOlverine, who is the most interesting character by far.  Virtually all of the characters are spectacularly complete as believable types, though I have never liked Brian Cox's open-mouthed style (he never quite rings true to me).  But it all seemed a bit too heavy to me, over-done as it is too ultimate and ambitious as a story extravaganza.<br /><br />Overall, warmly recommended.</p></body></html>

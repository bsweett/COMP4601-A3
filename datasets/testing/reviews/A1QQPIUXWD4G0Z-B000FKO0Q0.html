<meta name="summary" content="On The Edge Of Your Seat Suspense"></head><body><p>Andrew Davis' excellent adaptation of the 1960s mini-series of the same name in which a wrongly accused man becomes both a fugitive from justice and an avenger for the murder of his wife by the one-armed man.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a doctor in Chicago wrongfully found guilty of killing his wife.  No one believes his claim of a one-armed man and he escapes hoping to later prove his innocence by finding this unique killer.  Tommy Lee Jones plays the equally determined U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard who, although he sympathizes with Kimble, is not about to let someone escape under his watch.<br /><br />The film is a series of non-stop action sequences keeping the audience in awe and in suspense.  Excellent direction and impeccable acting makes this film a treasure to own in your collection.  Both Ford and Jones did an outstanding job in this film and the action sequences are brilliant.  Don't let this fast-paced suspense thriller escape your DVD player!</p></body></html>

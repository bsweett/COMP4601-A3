<meta name="summary" content="Review of the &quot;Scarface&quot; Anniversary Edition DVD"></head><body><p>&quot;Scarface&quot; has finally been given the proper DVD treatment with this special 20th anniversary edition of the movie. While originally dismissed by film critics as an ultra-glossy celebration of violence, profanity, and drug use, this movie has now earned its rank as a modern-day classic. Al Pacino's ultra-charismatic performance of Cuban refugee turned drug kingpin, Tony Montana is certainly the highlight of this massive crime epic. <p>Tony and his partner, Manolo have exiled from Cuba and are looking to capitalize on the &quot;American dream&quot;. Starting off as foot soldiers for boss Frank Lopez, they soon move their way up the ladder in the world of drug-dealing. With bloodbaths and double-crosses at every turn of the corner, Tony eventually finds himself on top of the drug kingdom with Lopez's beautiful girlfriend (Michelle Pfeifer) as his wife and a fortune in drug money at his disposal. <p>&quot;Scarface&quot; is not a beautiful love story. It is in its essence, a tale of capitalism gone awry. While Pacino's Montana is often viewed as a loyal guy, it is his greed that manages to destroy not only himself but everyone around him. He fiends for his boss' girlfriend out of lust, not love. His relationship with this character is never treated as a romance. She is a prize that comes with the territory. The only person Tony does seem to have unconditional love for is his sister but even that love is of a such a controlling nature that he never allows for her to find true happiness. By the end of the second act, Tony is so caught up in his world of greed and drug-enduced paranoia that he seems all but finished. The murder of his best friend seems to foreshadow his own downfall.<p>This movie has become a staple of pop culture. Montana's trademark lines have been quoted in every movie from FRIDAY to ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS. While it was originally best known for its violence in such scenes as the infamous chainsaw sequence and the bullet-riddled conclusion, &quot;Scarface&quot; has grown to be a larger-than-life film.<br /><br />While this movie is revered by many as a true classic, the film itself is flawed but it is in those subtle imperfections that we have come to know and love this film. Pacino's trademark accent is ridicilous but appealing nonetheless. In fact, most of the Cuban characters are played by Italian-American actors. Steven Bauer, one of the select few authentic Cuban actors in the film is entertaining in his portrayal of Manolo, Tony's sidekick. <p>This &quot;special edition&quot; DVD presentation is amazing. We get an in-depth look at the making of the film, deleted scenes, and an explanation of the influence of the film on today's audience. This DVD is definetly an essential addition to any true film buff's collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Are they releasing Michael Crichton films on to Blu-Ray backwards based on appeal?"></head><body><p>I'm a huge Michael Crichton fan.  But, I've noticed that the best of Micheal Crichton is still unavailable on Blu-ray.  Even though I'm not particularly fond of Jurassic Park, it is considered his most famous story and film, and yet not available on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />"Twister" is Okay.  It's not Michael Crichton's best story writing film effort.  Far from it.  And the other known Micheal Crichton film currently available on Blu-Ray is "Sphere".  It's had mediocre reviews, but yet it too, has been made available on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I'm not particularly fond of "The Andromeda Strain", but I'd appreciate it over "Twister" and "Sphere", as I'm sure many people do.  But, these are the Micheal Crichton films that I am sure MANY people are anxious to see remastered in High Definition on to Blu-ray.  Prepare to get a hard-on when you see all these great movies suggested all in one sentence:<br /><br />"Westworld", "Coma", "The Great Train Robbery", "Runaway", "Looker", "The 13th Warrior", "Rising Sun", "Congo", and "Disclosure."<br /><br />These are the one's that we are waiting for on Blu-Ray.  Perhaps we could get a box set put together like they did for Stanley Kubrick since he's dead now, too.  One less person they'll have to pay royalties to.</p></body></html>

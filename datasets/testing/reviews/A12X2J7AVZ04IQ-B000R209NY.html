<meta name="summary" content="Good, but why a remake?"></head><body><p>The original "Poseidon Adventure" was loaded with action, soap opera, and totally unbelievable events. I'm still amused that middle-aged Shelley Winters had her high school breath-holding medal around her neck at a crucial moment. The new film is probably better, though it lacks serious character development. At the time of such a crisis, I doubt everyone will stop and talk about their lives, so it makes sense. CGI effects were Oscar nominated and Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell were fine, as well as Emmy Rossum. Jacinda Barrett overacted horribly, but the kid who played her son was excellent. I still don't know why the old super-epics need to be re-made, but in the hands of Wolfgang Peterson, this was better drama. Irwin Allen's original was more fun, if only for the schlock, and it's "original" idea from Paul Gallico, who also wrote "The Three Lives of Thomasina"..in the 30's. Re-imagining ideas will always be exciting to the Hollywood honchos. Do they realize that some original material might appeal to the public?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a pretty nifty horror film"></head><body><p>I am a big fan of horror films, especially ones that really make you think about death.  Final Destination 3 mainly focuses on death, and the story is about predicting when and how someone is going to die.<br /><br />This movie was exceptionally worthwhile for the violence and blood.  The way the plot works is that each of the characters (all teenagers) are supposed to die in a certain order, and it's up to one of the girls (along with a teenage boy) to try and figure out a way to stop it from happening.  They try connecting clues from the pictures they took at a carnival, and this all adds up to a lot of careful creativity on the part of the writers.<br /><br />This means the boy and the girl will frequently find themselves in a situation where something doesn't feel right, and then they will remember something similar from a picture they took at the carnival.  When they realize that something from a picture happens to be right there in front of them at the moment, death begins to turn its ugly head in their direction and they have to try and escape with their lives.<br /><br />Let me try to make some sense of this by using an example: in one instance the girl remembers a picture she took of her male friends face up against the camera, squinting and fooling around.  This picture predicted that the boy would actually be squinting for real because of a dangerous situation he would soon encounter.  This is how the story works.<br /><br />The film also does a good job building suspense when a death is about to happen, because sometimes you can tell a death is just around the corner, however, the writers of the film must have really great brains because a LOT of creativity went into the way the characters in the film died.<br /><br />I'd say the feel of the movie was similar to that of I Know What You Did Last Summer (teenagers that die one by one) but the actual horror plotline was more interesting and violent overall in Final Destination 3.</p></body></html>

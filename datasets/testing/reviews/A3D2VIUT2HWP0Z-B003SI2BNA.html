<meta name="summary" content="UNRATED VERSION:A Step up from the Theatrical  Edition"></head><body><p>I did enjoy the theatrical  edition, but the unrated disc  takes the experience to a whole new level. It is an ambivalent level, since the special features specifically state that  there are "two explanations" for  all the things that happen, i.e.  one psychological, one supernatural. However, this seems to be more of a producers pretensions of grandeur, than a real explanation.<br />It is a film that indulges in more of a character  driven  exposition of the story, so that in that respect, you  have to work more at enjoying the film. It's  definitely not an FX  driven film, but as the special  features  show, there are "FX" done so that the sound stage in Canada can be integrated with the Roosevelt island  background. The sound is totally awesome , in that with a 5.1  system, and the sound turned up, you can experience what is a very edgy film in this unrated version.<br />Play times for the film vary, some say  103, some, like  AMAZON, say 105, and overall this is not clear, but the extra few, or the different few minutes done in this  edit pay off immensely in a very watchable, listenable, and experiential  film.<br />The extras are very enjoyable; they add to the experience of the film, and show in detail, the elements of the almost indie film. The power is really in the casting for the  script, and whilst the editing could have flowed a little  better, the sound covers much of the fragmented editing. And the sound is clearly an additional character/feature to the film ( as is the water, to say the least). The deleted scenes are not many, but at least one scene  should have stayed in ... worth seeing this part to see if the scenes should have stayed the same or not. Whilst the visual editing is debatably fragmented, it might be that the fragmenting expresses a side of the characters experience... but, thats in the eye of the beholder, I assume.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's fluff, but it's good fluff"></head><body><p>As has been said in other reviews, it is truly the stellar cast and acting of this film that make it wonderful. Otherwise, I'm afraid that the fluffy plot would bomb.  But the actors are fresh, funny, and very much into making the movie work.  Most of the joy of watching this is indeed the actors and their corresponding characters.<br /><br />But do not be mistaken by the fluffy plot comment.  While I'm sure that this is the type of movie that would drive many nuts, those that can appreciate simple light-hearted goodness will enjoy this. It's funny, sweet, and, while not carrying too much in the way of complexity, packs plenty of heart.<br /><br />It's fun to watch, and Hathaway and Streep have amazing banter.  If that's all you need to like a movie, this will work well.</p></body></html>

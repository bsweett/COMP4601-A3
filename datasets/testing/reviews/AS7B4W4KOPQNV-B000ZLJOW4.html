<meta name="summary" content="Great Dark Comedy!"></head><body><p>I love this film.  It mixes together comedy and drama really well.  Steve Buscemi was great in his role as the nerdy record collector.  The movie was about an 18 year old girl, Enid(Thora Birch), who just graduated high school and doesn't quite know what she wants out of life.  Her best friend, Rebecca(Scarlett Johanson), keeps nagging her about moving into an apartment with her.  While playing a prank on a lonely middle-aged man, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), Enid becomes very close to him and learns that he is very interesting.  Although this film stars teen actresses, it is not a teen movie.  I highly reccomend this to everyone, it was THAT good!</p></body></html>

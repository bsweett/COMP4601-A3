<meta name="summary" content="Scarface on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>While I own the 2 disc Standard Def set that came out a few years ago, I thought I would buy this Blu Ray edition without the Digital Copy.  Very glad to have made the purchase.<br /><br />In past version I often wondered why it appeared so blanched out, especially in the early scenes as Tony Montana, Manny, Angel and a friend were going to do the deal with the Columbians.  The new Blu Ray edition brings back all the color and vitality to the original image and stays vital though out the film.  The Blu Ray version truly has provided a significant improvement over previous Scarface releases.  It's not perfect, there is some grain here and there, easy to see in the sky shots and when the cement walls are in the shots.  However, this grain is not exceedingly so and does not distract, nor is it there in most of the film.  At the end of the movie, as Tony and associates bring Gina back to his mansion after Tony kills Manny, there is a wide shot of the red carpeted staircase.  I did notice some aliasing at the bottom of the staircase, but as the camera zooms in, it goes away.  Red has always been a very difficult color to reproduce which is why it is rarely used in credits as it can cause stair-stepping and aliasing, however, this was the only instance where I saw any and it last but a few seconds.<br />The blu ray transfer is really very, very good.<br /><br />The two disc Standard Def version used DTS 5.1 audio while the Blu Ray provides 7.1 DTSHD audio.  The score is spread very nicely though out the entire speaker system,(mine is 5.1) however, there really is very little use of any of the channels for discreet directionality making the 7.1 possibilities only useful for the music score itself.  Audio always seems to get the short end of the financial straw in film releases and transfers, and Scarface is no different.  There were plenty of opportunities for surround foley fx in the riot at the holding camp as well as the final mansion shootout.  Sides and rears are sometimes used for slight panning of the vehicles and not much more.  The dialogue is clear and properly leveled so once you set your volume you should not have to reset at any time.<br /><br />The video transfer and movie gets 5 stars from me, while the audio gets 3.<br />Hopefully, this review has been helpful, and if so, click on that help button so I know I am on the right track.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Weak Film From a Gifted Writer!"></head><body><p>I am a huge horror movie and book fan, but "Hellraiser" was beyond lame. While Pinhead is a cool looking villian, he wasn't in this film more than five minutes. The acting was even below some of the worst horror films I have ever seen (Pinhead excluded of course). I liked Clive Barker's novel The Hellbound Heart, but this movie was cheesy beyond belief. I need to watch my copy of John Carpenter's "The Thing" again to remind myself why I love horror films so much. Stick to writing Clive!</p></body></html>

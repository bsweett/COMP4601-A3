<meta name="summary" content="A flop about a wimp and a nonsense issue"></head><body><p>Disappointing.  I agree with the professional reviewer on this site who said that Adam Sandler was in over his head in this role.  He does poorly in it.  Why is he played as such a sap?  Why is it that you want to smack him every time he fails to assert himself?<br /><br />I don't buy the multi-cultural nonsense either, the big deal about the Hispanic daughter losing her culture.  What kind of issue is that?  What kind of moron thought that was a big issue?  Oh hell, you don't want to hang out with Anglos, you don't want to go to a prestigious school, you just want to live in the Barrio.  Oh give me a break.  It's idiocy.  A non-issue for dummies.<br /><br />The film is simply a big flop.</p></body></html>

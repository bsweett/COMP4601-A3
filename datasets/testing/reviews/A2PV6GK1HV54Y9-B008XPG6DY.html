Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston have great chemistry together. They play Charles and Lucinda, they meet on their morning commute and there is an immediate attraction which leads to a casual and brief affair. I don't want to give too much away but their is a twist so pay attention to that detail. Good movie to watch when you are bored out of your mind. Clive Owen is a cutie pie!</p></body></html>

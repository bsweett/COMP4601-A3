<meta name="summary" content="Yeah, a Good Slice of Life"></head><body><p>Much has been made of the tragic and untimely death of actress and filmmaker Adrienne Shelley. Unfortunately, the publicity of her demise made me want to avoid this movie when it hit the theaters, fearing the sorrow of her circumstance would cloud this movie for me. Sounds illogical now, but then, it made sense. However, months after leaving the theater, and me popping this DVD into my player, time has shown her last movie "Waitress" to be an unusual movie in so many ways.<br /><br />Keri Russell, hair and all, stars in this movie about being trapped in life circumstances, and how getting out of that trap isn't so easy. Keri plays the titular Jenna, a woman trapped in a dead end marriage only to find out she's pregnant after a night of alcoholic drudgery with her own husband. Her only talent, and a very marketable one at that, is making pies, which helps her narrate this charming feature. It's Jenna's sometimes off decision making ability that drive this picture. Will she escape her horrid husband to a better life? Will she give up the baby once she has it? Will she go out of her mind?<br /><br />Russell's Jenna is extremely funny and tragic. You can tell how easy it is for a beautiful girl to make a wrong decision or two, and end up as a waitress in a pie diner in the south. It's happened to her two friends, Becky and Dawn, each who wrestle with their own unusual demons in the story. Shelley's script is wise to never allowing this film to become anything sentimental, which may have allowed the film to sap into a Hallmark special all too easily. Jenna's hatred of her pregnancy is funny and understandable.<br /><br />Rarely do films surprise me, genuinely, but I was surprised at the end of the movie, which I shall not divulge here. Shelley saved us a couple of things for the ending that both make sense and bring a sense of joy to the movie that is unsurpassed. When Jenna walks away from the diner (no spoilers here!), you are walking with her, reveling that she has finally made some good decisions after all.<br /><br />It's too bad that Shelley didn't live to see the acclaim this movie earned. It's too bad that this creative filmmaker's voice was silenced by a heinous act. But the movie Waitress is a joyous act, and a fitting tribute to women everywhere who, like Jenna, must find their ways out of their own lives, into the life of possible.</p></body></html>

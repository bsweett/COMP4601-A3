<meta name="summary" content="A joyous celebration of kinship and love"></head><body><p>What exactly did producers Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson see in this romantic comedy written and co-starring Nia Viadalos? The answer can also be simultaneously found in this sleeper hit which grossed more than 200 million in the U.S box office with a growing audience. This low-budget vehicle could have been a slapstick perfunctory sitcom outing if not for the spontaneity and sincerity when Ms. Vardalos regards her rambunctious Greek family. Exuding down-to-earth appeals as Tulas, she narrates her troubles with the family when she falls in love with a vegetarian WASP Ian Miller (John Corbett). The ensemble of the supporting casts fill the shoes of her extensive relatives which includes 27 cousins as well as a complaining aunt. They give shades of warmth and compassion to break free of their stereotypical mold - and Ms. Vardalos knows them so well that this becomes a joyous celebration of kinship as well as love.</p></body></html>

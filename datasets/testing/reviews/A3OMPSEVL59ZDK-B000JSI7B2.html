<meta name="summary" content="3 1/2 It's Bloody Good Time"></head><body><p>Just a few points that have already been reiterated throughout most of these reviews.<p>1)Beautiful Cinematography<p>2)Johnny Depp. It may appear to be the same role he did in Sleepy Hallow BUT the man can act.<p>3)Great Directors<p>Now I was surprised at what a complete gore fest this movie was. It's so maniacly fun, more of a slasher pic then a thriller. I took me completely by surprise at how far they went with this pic, at times bordering on NC17 type gore. Great stuff. Definetly check it out. And the mystery of who Jack was will get you through between the killings. <p>A Bloody Good film.</p></body></html>

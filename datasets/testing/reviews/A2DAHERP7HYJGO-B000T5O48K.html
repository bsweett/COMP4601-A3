And while that movie blatantly rocked your senses his newest film "Bug" does so in much more subtle ways.<br /><br />The movie revolves around Agnes White (Ashley Judge), a woman living in a convenience motel in a nowhere town in Oklahoma. Her life consists of working in a lesbian bar and dreading the calls from her ex husband Jerry Goss (Harry Connick Jr.), a man who abused her that who she fears and who has recently been paroled.<br /><br />One night a friend of Agnes introduces her to Peter Evans (Michael Shannon) and things are never the same. Peter is a quiet, odd sort who finds refuge in Agnes' room. Eventually he finds it in her arms as well. The two misfits find themselves attracted and things could turn out fine with the exception of one fact: bugs.<br /><br />Peter begins to find them everywhere, microscopic bugs that he claims the government inserted into him as a guinea pig. Is this man insane or a part of some major conspiracy?<br /><br />From there we are drawn into a world where two people find themselves ruled by the concept of these "bugs". And as a battered woman who thinks she has found love begins to become convinced that what he says is true, Agnes is attacked by the same bugs. Until the last scene we never know for sure they exist or not.<br /><br />The movie offers a number of disturbing scenes, one of which is graphically violent. But perhaps more disturbing is the sense of paranoia and the possibility of Agnes' being brainwashed as opposed to there actually being bugs. Her willingness to believe becomes a centerpiece for the film.<br /><br />While the movie may not be for everyone nor invite multiple viewings, it does offer some great performances from the entire cast and a compelling story that makes you want to watch till the finish. This one may not be one to add to your collection, but it is one that you will want to add to your viewing list.</p></body></html>

While I am happy that Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley did not return for this film (don't get me wrong, I like their characters, but what other stories could they tell with these characters?), the addition of Cruz seemed a bit out of sorts. Even though the romantic history and sexual tension was there between her and Jack, I still didn't really believe it. She seemed more like just another enemy in disguise, almost Jack's equal. McShane was good as Blackbeard. The other thing that threw me off was the side story of Sam Claflin's Philip and &Agrave;strid Berg&egrave;s-Frisbey's mermaid Syrena, which was a great aspect of the film. However, their story ends with no real closure or clue as to their fates. It's as if the writers just forgot all about them. After seeing this, I was hoping that the film series would come to an end, but, with the post-credits scene, I fear we still have more to come from this dying franchise.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty entertaining but could have used some better editing"></head><body><p>I am usually wary of books that are turned into films. "Memoirs of a Geisha" turned out to be a disappointment when I saw the film adaptation. I was a bit wary when I heard that "The Da Vinci Code" was going to be turned into a movie but all suspicions were put to rest when I saw a trailer for it a month or two ago.<br /><br />The premise of the film revolves around the death of an elderly art curator who leaves behind a series of clues to a box that contains a map to the Holy Grail and from there a 2 1/2 hour rollercoaster thrill ride. Tom Hanks plays symobologist Robert Langdon who is the prime suspect in the death of the curator. With the assistance from Sophie Neveu (the lovely Audrey Tatou), the pair. The duo immediately sets off on a journey which involves a box with a five petal rose, inside what may possibly be a map to the holy grail.<br /><br />I have read the novel and the film adaptation is pretty spot on. There were a few minor alterations but nothing major. I personally enjoyed the film for what it was which is entertainment. Do I believe that Jesus and Mary Magdelene had a child and she survived to continue on their bloodline? No. Both the book and the novel is purely fictional.<br /><br />What I liked about the film was the build up in suspense through out the film. I personally thought Ron Howard did a pretty good job on creating an aura of suspense in the scenes involving Silas (Paul Bettany) or when Robert and Sophie were running from the cops. I loved Hans Zimmer's orchestral score. It fit perfectly with the theme of the film.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the film is Ron Howard's addiction to flashback scenes. Like Peter Jackson, Ron just does not know how to edit his films. I admit I liked the flashback scenes but after awhile they got annoying. Any wonders why I don't see Ron's films in the theatre, it is because they are too freaking long. Tom Hanks may be a good actor but I felt that someone else probably could have been a more convincing Robert Langdon.  I loved the supporting cast though. I found his long hair in the film rather distracting. It looked like Peppe LePew the skunk died on top of his head.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed "The Da Vinci Code" as a movie and nothing more. I liked the twists and turns in the storyline. Ian McKellan was a lot of fun to watch as well as Paul Bettany as the creepy Silas. For all its flaws, "The Da Vinci Code" is a solid summer blockbuster film.</p></body></html>

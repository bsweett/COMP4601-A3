<meta name="summary" content="The Mariachi's back in black, on purpose"></head><body><p>Desperado was the necessary addition to Roberto Rodriguez's original film, The Mariachi.  Although the director is the same, there is definitely a revamp in the film.  For example, Antonio Banderas replaced the original actor of The Mariachi to play the character in Desperado.  This gives you a sense of what one can do with more money and a bit more time.<br /><br /> However, I have not given you a sense of the story.  The story is set a few years after The Mariachi ended, with Steve Buscemi's character telling tales of this gun slinging Mariachi.  Apparently, Antonio Bandera's character, the Mariachi, has put up his guitar for his new lifestyle of revenge killings.  With his final revenge nearing, Banderas has many difficulties as his progress is halted many times.  Only when another lady comes into his life, played by Salma Hayek, does Bandera get back on his mission.<br /><br /> This movie was good, and entertaining.  I do not feel that the acting was necessarily exemplary, although I did like Buscemi playing the role that he did, because it just seemed to fit him so well.  The gun battles were neat, and the cinematography over all was nice.  What really made this movie for me was the connection with The Mariachi, because it was not unlike, for good reason, Tarantino's style of tie-ins to previous movies.  This movie would get a 3.5 for its revitalization of the modern Western, with a distinctly Southwest/Mexican feel.  However, I can only give it a three or four, and I round down, so three it is.</p></body></html>

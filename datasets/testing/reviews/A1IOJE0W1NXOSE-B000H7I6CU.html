The main character is Lightning McQueen, the self-centered, sassy young car whose goal is to displace veteran cars and win the coveted Piston Cup, the pinnacle of car racing.  When he finishes the big race in a dead heat with two other cars, he qualifies for a re-run of the race in California.  On his way to the race, McQueen falls out of his transport van and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs on Route 66.  While he's there, McQueen learns what it's like to work as part of a team and to really care about people.  We watched this DVD as three generations, and there was something to appeal to everyone.  Grandpa and Gran were impressed with the rendering of the cars from the 50's and 60's, Mom and Dad loved the story, and the grandkids enjoyed the action and the loveable characters.  This is great family entertainment!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Aping Tim Burton On"></head><body><p>"Planet of the Apes" is a remake of sorts of the 1968 film of the same name, directed by Tim Burton. I haven't seen the original, but I thought I'd see the remake first to minimize disappointment by comparison. I really liked it, actually, and once again I'm suprised at the low average amazon response.<br /><br />It's 2029, and a space station is sending chimps out into space to investigate a large magnetic storm. Leo is an astronaut there, and one of the trainers of the chimp. His favorite is sent to investigate the storm, and vanishes within it, so Leo blasts off after it in his spacecraft. There is a bright flash of light, and Leo crash lands on a wild jungle of a planet, full of talking Apes, who keep timid humans as slaves. There are a few that are compassionate towards humans, but only a few. Where has Leo landed? His homing beacon still works, and it appears his crewmates have landed on the other side of the planet. If he can make it back to them, he'll be able to escape this savage, nightmarish world. But will he be able to escape?<br /><br />Apart from the Danny Elfman score, it would be hard to tell this was a Tim Burton film, if you didn't already know. Then again, Burton's spookhouse quirks don't really lend themselves to remakes of 1960s sci-fi, so maybe that's why they're kept to a minimum here. The special effects, the design of the spaceships, the costumes and makeup are all really classy I thought. They're great to look at, but they're not overdone or obsessed with being state-of-the-art. It's a heartfelt retro, rather than a slavish imitation, I thought. I also thought the way the Ape soldiers moved, closely mimicking real life primates, was a really interesting touch. I haven't seen the original, but I know enough about it to tell you that the ending is very different in this version. I'm still trying to piece together why it concluded in the way it did, its a bit of a head scratcher (in a good way, though)...<br /><br />Personally I think it's worth a look for sci-fi fans. It's not the deepest movie in the world, but it's an entertaining spectacle.</p></body></html>

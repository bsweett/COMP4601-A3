<meta name="summary" content="Atmospheric Vampire Tale"></head><body><p>After all the romantic fluff and angst of the "Twilight" movies, "Let Me In," a remake of the Swedish film "Let the Right One In," puts the vampire back into its traditional cinematic conventions even though director Matt Reeves transplants the location to New Mexico in 1983.  The title relates to one of the ground rules of vampirism:  vampires must be invited in before they can pounce.<br /><br />Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz, "Kick-Ass") meets Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee, "The Road"), the product of a broken home and the victim of brutal bullying at school, in the courtyard of their apartment complex.  They both appear to be twelve-year-olds, but Abby says they can never be friends.  Her behavior is odd.  She walks in the snow barefoot and never goes to school.  Still, the two form a bond against the background of a series of gruesome murders.<br /><br />Horror movies seldom achieve the level of "Let Me In."  It all comes down to a solid script with believable performances.  I have no problem with screenwriters and directors tweaking the vampire legend to give their movies an interesting spin.  What bothers me is a vampire that is more yuppie sauntering around in daylight than nocturnal bloodsucker.  In this film, Abby follows in the grand tradition of vampires.  Her evident victim, Owen, actually encourages her friendship and she soon becomes his protector.  But what will eventually happen to Owen?<br /><br />Ms. Moretz is very good as Abby -- charming, creepy, scary, sympathetic, savage as the plot dictates.  She sells her character.  Director Reeves wisely duplicates the frigid atmosphere of the Swedish original.  The graphic scenes are shot with a minimum of light to keep them both frightening and mysterious.  Often, American remakes of foreign films fall short, but "Let Me In" retains the bleak, haunting mood of the original while pepping up the pace and incorporating more action.  It is a well-made movie worth your attention.<br /><br />Bonus features on both the R-rated Blu-ray and DVD editions include audio commentary with writer/director Matt Reeves, making-of and art of special effects featurettes, unrated deleted scenes, and a step-by-step look at the creation of one of the movie's action sequences.</p></body></html>

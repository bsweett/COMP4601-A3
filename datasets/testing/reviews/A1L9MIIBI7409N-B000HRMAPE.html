<meta name="summary" content="Better than Bond"></head><body><p>Better than some recent James Bond films, MI 3 is a shoot-for-the-moon international caper which moves well into the new millennium.  This episode takes us from Berlin to the Vatican to Shanghai - ambitious indeed.  Slick, youthful and fun, Tom's partners in crime - Ving Rhames, Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are cool and great eye candy.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is a good actor, but still looks too much like a blonde teddy bear to be menacing for me.  In spite of this, the movie works.  Instead of suffering from sucky sequel-itis, the MI 3 creative team keeps making these films better.  And that's what I appreciate about the movie.  I suspect that JJ Abrams has to take a lot of credit for improving the drama and clarity of the story, which has more character and drama than the usual slam bang action flick.<br /><br />And at the end of it all, there's no denying that Tom Cruise knows what he is doing.  Laugh or sneer at him, but Cruise knows how to deliver with the right team.  It remains to be seen what will happen to the eternally youthful Cruise (will he end up like Arnold or Stallone?) and MI 3 could be the last of an era, I suspect.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another delightful family film from Pixar"></head><body><p>In Pixar's CARS, directed by TOY STORY director John Lasseter, the world is populated entirely by - you guessed it - cars.  So it's only natural that the biggest event in the entire car world is the Piston Cup, the world's most popular race (inspired by the ever-popular NASCAR racing).  This year, the public's rooting for Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), an immensely-talented albeit egotistic rookie.  While traveling to California to prepare for the Piston Cup, Lightning's driver, Mack (John Ratzenberger), dozes off and sends Lightning off into the middle of nowhere.  The middle of nowhere happens to be the small town of Radiator Springs, or - as Lightning described it - "hillbilly hell".  Though at first Lightning wants nothing more than to escape from Radiator Springs and win the Piston Cup, he gradually becomes more and more attached to the town and its citizens, eventually realizing that friends and family mean more than fame.<br /><br />Pixar makes family movies better than anyone.  Adults find their films just as entertaining as do children.  CARS is no exception, though it lacks the power of many of Pixar's previous creations, such as TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO.  Also, it is becoming more and more clear that Pixar's films seem to revolve around the same sort of formula.  Eventually, I believe that this will begin to bother some adults, but the children will go on loving these films, and that's what the films are here for in the first place.<br /><br />The cast for CARS is even more impressive than that of previous Pixar films.  The cast includes, along with Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin, NASCAR racers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr., FINDING NEMO/A BUG'S LIFE director Andrew Stanton, Jay Leno, and Michael Keaton.  That is quite the cast.  It also features music by Randy Newman and some fantastic animation.<br /><br />Despite all that it has going for it, CARS was considered a flop at the box office, primarily when compared to Pixar's previous masterpieces.  I believe that this is due in part to the advertising, which I thought made the film look like many of the other stupid CGI family film imitations in theaters recently.  All I can say is disregard the advertising and see the film for yourself.  It's another delightful family film from Pixar.  Your kids'll love it, and you'll love it too.  What more could you ask for?</p></body></html>

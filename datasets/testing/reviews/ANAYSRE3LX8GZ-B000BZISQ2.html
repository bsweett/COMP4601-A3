Only Shwartzenegger and whoever the shrink docotor is have returned for the film from the previous 2 great action blockbusters. And it certinly IMO suffred with out the original creator James Camron.<p>The plot takes place 10 years or so since the last blockbuster movie T2; Judgment day. John Conner is a loner, his mother has passed away and he is his familly Toto! I strongly beleive the intrest to this film is the fact that there is a female terminator, and theres guys enjoying seeing her in tight clothing. That kind of image never works for me so the movie failed in its attempt to sell scenes in a uncalled for way! I'd like to see alot more woman become action stars, there sure isnt enough of them, but this new terminator is hardly threatning at all, and unlike in T2 with the t-1000..this soupposed new upgraded terminator looks more downgraded!<p>A new Terminator has been sent back to not just kill John Conner but also another leader of the resistance and a bunch of other people too! And of coarse Arnold is sent back once more as a terminator to protect them.<p>The movie suffered in alot of plot ideas IMO, I dont care that Arnold returned...with few SFX shots gave some great action seaqunces, the SFX where no where near as impressive as the ground breaking SFX that T2 provided us with! This plot also rueins the whole genre of the Terminator. Particuly the most i did not like was the ending to this film. The ending IMO has been rueind, and has created a non beleivable ending, unlike the last 2 movies. If they make a 4th movie, they should consider highly about going back in time to prevent the events that happend in this film, other wise this movie has rueind the terminator story lines IMO.<p>Rent it first, many people judge this movie on Arnie and a female in tight cloths to sell a sexy image rather then concentrate on important and significant things to make the movie beleiable. The begining is kind of cool, then it drifts, then its going no where, then it picks up, then the end ruens the entire saga! Only a 4th movie can fix the bad idea on how to finish this film IMO!<p>Bonus features are forgetable, and its no wonder they cut a few of the deleted scenes, if they had have been included the movie would have done harm to the terminator saga even further!</p></body></html>

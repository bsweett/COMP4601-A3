<meta name="summary" content="The Quintessential Bond Film"></head><body><p>Though "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" got the ball rolling, it was "Goldfinger" (1964) that started the 007 phenomenon - establishing a cinematic formula that has endured from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan. In a recent interview, Connery said his portrayal of James Bond may have set too high a standard for the other actors to match. The same can be said for the early 007 films. With the exception of "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" (1969), it's hard to top the excitement and inventiveness of "Goldfinger." The villains, gadgets and locales are top notch, with Connery in splendid form. Admittedly, the Fort Knox climax is a bit hokey in spots and it's obvious that American gangsters are played by British actors. Despite these dated elements, "Goldfinger" is a definite highpoint in the 007 series.</p></body></html>

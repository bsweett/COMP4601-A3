<meta name="summary" content="CRASHED AND BURNED!"></head><body><p>I was looking foward to seeing this movie when I first saw the TV trailer(teaser).I saw a few more trailers and that reduced to me to a mild interest. When the dvd came out I was sorry I even spent one cent on the rental. The film desperatly reaches in some way to capture the classic image and storyline of a bygone era in filmmaking. It miserably fails. Waiting for it to end was about the extent of the suspense. Gwyneth Paltrows acting was horrendous. Her blank stare and rote lines left me bored beyond comprehension. Jude Law(Sky captain)should never be considered to play any role that even remotely resembles a robust action hero. He is best suited as maybe an icecream man in a lowbudget, British troubled teens film. Angelia Jolie, who was primarily used to sell this film in clips tries , but looks lost, yearning to yank off that eye patch. The story, which is hardly explainable(or worth it)is a convoluted, heaping pile of junk. The film backfired because in its attempt to simulate good old style cliffhangers with futuristic imagery, it actually copied the worst of the films it was trying to duplicate. The old look glow that was intended to enhance the retro feel bugged my eyes out. It is not meant for prolonged viewing. The film appeared very blurry at times because of this. I would have given the movie no stars, but this review system does not allow for that.</p></body></html>

I always loved those Die Hard movies (in fact, it's dangerous for me to channel surf if one of them is on TV) and was thrilled when Live Free actually happened.  The story, action, fx, acting, attitude are all there in spades.  Some things are worth revisting when they're done well.  This does not dissapoint.  A reason to actually drag your tired [...] to the movies and pay to watch commercials!!  Can't wait for the dvd.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A very entertaining popcorn movie."></head><body><p>I haven't aquired much interest in Nic Cage's more mainstream action films since his Leaving Las Vegas days. I simply went to see Ghost Rider for the thrill and excitments. It did give all that, and I enjoyed very much for that reason, but the story and characters are not very interesting and the love plot between Nic and Eva Mendes is even more low-key. I just think she's so wasted in a boring character without much depth. I have a feeling that Nic's ghost rider character is performed by stunt doubles since we don't even see his real face. Those scenes with the ghost rider are the real money shots. Nic was good with what he had to work with, nothing challenging for a heavy weight Oscar winner like him. Out of surprise, I was quite delighted to see Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot in support. They were both pretty scene-stealing. Fonda was exceptionally more outstanding playing the devil. He doesn't look evil, but his expressions and performances are. I also thought Wes Bentley was good as the villian. I almost had the chance to meet him recently on an indie Hank and Mike, but he dropped out and got replaced by Chris Klein. So I am not surprised that this film is selling, afterall, it's just a great popcorn movie filled with plenty of thrilling actions, stunts, and CGI's.</p></body></html>

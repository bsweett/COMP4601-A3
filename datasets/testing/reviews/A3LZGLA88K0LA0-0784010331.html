Featuring the now classic "consider this a divorce" scene, TOTAL RECALL bristles with electrical tension and brutally explicit action and violence.  Based on a short story by Philip Dick, the movie focuses on Arnie, whose memories have been wiped away and when he discovers that, it leads him to Mars and confrontations with nasty guys that want him dead.  Considering that this is a 1990 film, the special effects, set design, costuming, etc. are very impressive, as is the late Jerry Goldsmith's atmospheric score.<br /><br />Arnie is Arnie, who has never made us think of him as a serious actor, but this is his kind of movie, and he is surrounded with some competent supporting performers:  Rachel Ticotin as Melina, his love from his previous life, who exudes a smoldering sensuality; the then lesser known Sharon Stone, who plays Arnie's "wife" with a mixture of flirtatious sexuality and out and out viciousness; the irrepressible Michael Ironside, the consummate villain chewing up the scenery; and Ronny Cox as the nasty Coalhagen, who is masterminding all the trouble on Mars to meet his own excessive needs.<br /><br />This is one of those movies you can enjoy more than once, to savor the lush topography of Mars and Sharon Stone getting her just rewards.</p></body></html>

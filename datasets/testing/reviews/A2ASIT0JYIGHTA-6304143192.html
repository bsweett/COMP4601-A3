<meta name="summary" content="USA DVD is the only option"></head><body><p>The USA 2-disc edition of E.T is now the only available DVD anywhere in the world. Universal discontinued the UK and Australian DVD releases some time ago to reflect the limited edition, and while this was to be the case in America too, it is obvious that it is still available there.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the USA edition was always the only one worth buying because it included the 1982 release. The Australian and UK releases are PAL formatted which doesn't allow as much disc space as NTSC. Distributors in these regions therefore decided that consumers would prefer the full length special features over inclusion of the 1982 version. A pity because the 1982 version is much better, and how most of us remember it. I think Universal short-changed it's international clients.<br /><br />Many reviewers have slammed the 2002 version because of the CGI tampering of E.T's character. I have to agree with them, the CGI has caused E.T to look too comical in scenes and quite unrealistic. I can't comprehend how Spielberg considers these alterations an improvement and more aligned to his vision. However, if you own the USA DVD, it doesn't matter because you can simply choose the better 1982 version. In my opinion, movies shouldn't be enhanced unless it is to improve their picture quality (ie. to remove grain, dust etc).<br /><br />Overall, a movie worth owning (providing you have the USA DVD).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Old Friend on Blu-ray; Good Enough!"></head><body><p>I hoped for a better picture and sound but considering the source, I'm very happy with the A/V quality of an old friend. It looks and sounds very close to what showed in the theatre. Waiting for a better copy in 3-D may take a while; however a better transfer is possible which will probably happen for the lesser sequels which have a better print to show off. I will keep my early Criterion copy with commentaries featuring an FBI agent, the screenwriter, the director, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins (dropping items, like him choosing to mimic HAL for Lecter). I think that's a pretty good extra. In spite of it's limitations. the Criterion DVD A/V is close to the film. Ditto on the 2009 MGM BD plus a higher resolution. Many films from the early Orion days are high def challenged (like Robocop). There have been many periods where the flavor of the month was a soft focus picture!</p></body></html>

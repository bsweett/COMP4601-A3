<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but by no means a comedy gem"></head><body><p>This was the kind of comedy movie where I was laughing because I felt obligated to; most of the scenarios, characters, and dialogue seemed like they were supposed to elicit laughs. They were not innately funny. I like a comedy where I laugh completely by instinct, not out of pity or obligation. Now, there is some occasional funny stuff to be found in "The Hangover"; it's largely hit or miss. But for the most part this film is not the riotous, awesome experience that many people have claimed it to be. It's amusing. But nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />Part of the reason I saw this film was Roger Ebert's glowing, 3.5 out of 4 stars review. Not so thrilled with that now that I've seen the flick. He practically made it out to be another "Animal House" or "The Blues Brothers", the way he described it. And to be honest, a generous chunk of his review was plot synopsis. I can get that elsewhere. But I digress.<br /><br />In "The Hangover", I didn't care about the characters. The three guys were all flawed (which is necessary in comedy) but none of them was likeable. The weirdo with the beard (Zach Galifianakis as Alan Garner... this has been called a 'stand-out' or 'breakout' performance, for some reason) was very odd and deadpan, but he did not have the makings of a great comedy character. And actually, it was established early on that he's a pedophile.<br /><br />There are silly things in the film, but there are also things that I didn't find amusing: harming a baby for a laugh doesn't work for me. Plus, I felt that many things seen in this film had been done before. And there was even a "Rain Man" homage. I guess that's supposed to be cute. Whatever.<br /><br />The nice 'n tidy, happy-ever-after, tacked-on ending of this movie made me want to heave. Why does America always need happy or nice endings all the time? Couldn't a comedy film end on a sour note once in a while? It's almost bizarre to have a movie like this-- where there is an impending sense of doom running through it-- end on a pleasant note.<br /><br />This is worth checking out for a couple of giggles, if you want to satisfy curiosity. Most of us can relate to a night of overt decadence and some next-morning forgetfulness. (This must have have been one long night these guys spent in their drugged stupor.) But I won't be seeking this film out for a second viewing; not a chance. If I want to laugh I will stick with Mel Brooks films, early Woody Allen movies, Monty Python, The Marx Brothers, or the Christopher Guest mockumentaries. For my money, "The Hangover" belongs with other highly overrated comedy movies like "Meet the Parents", "American Pie", and "There's Something About Mary".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Review for 3D 4 disc set--film looks stunning, documentary terrific--you're mileage may vary on the film itself"></head><body><p>Ridley Scott wanted to make a film that asked big questions but, at the same time, could be tied into the same universe he pioneered for the "Alien" franchise. Although flawed "Prometheus" does have merit. You can read all the pro (5 star) and con (1 star)reviews to determine the brilliance or stupidity of this film.<br /><br />I'd argue that eventually "Prometheus" may, like "Blade Runner", see its reptutation rise with time. Either way, "Prometheus" is an often stunning looking film from Scott and, in spite of its narrative flaws (the script does have issues), the larger-than-life production values certainly make the film appear impressive looking.<br /><br />You're mileage may vary but try and ignore the hype associated with the film and put your expectations aside. If you ignore both you may find the film enjoyable.<br /><br />The 3D Blu-ray disc looks positively stunning--Scott shows an instinctive feel for 3D--the director uses the process to impress with the gradeur of the film and not as a gimmick. The transfer looks brilliant with deep, inky blacks and an amazing amount of detail evident. During the starmap sequence in particular the 3D effect is positively stunning. Depth is remarkably strong throuhgout the presentation.<br /><br />The regular Blu-ray also looks stunning BUT some players are having some issues (Sony players for example even with the latest upgrade for firmware)with pixelation and cubing where the image breaks up. Usually this is an issue with the disc itself and I'm going to assume that it is in this case although it would be wise to make sure your firmware is up-to-date.<br /><br />The 3D four disc edition comes with a DVD of the film in addition to the 3D and 2D Blu presentation. All three discs have the commentary track and there are deleted/alternate scenes (some of which should have been kept in the film despite pacing issues as they explained the behavior of some characters and gave others additional depth).<br /><br />The fourth disc features a terrific, in depth documentary on the making of the film directed by Charles de Lauzirika. "Furious Gods" covers everything from the conception of the film (it began as an "Alien" prequel/reboot), changes to the script over time, production designs and changes to the look of the film as pre-production progressed to production. We get plenty of behind-the-scenes footage. At three hours it's a massive documentary that is equally as impressive as the film looks.<br /><br />We also get the "viral" videos made of a younger Weyland, information on the production of "David" the android and other bits and pieces (including a bit of text that "suggests" a link between "Blade Runner" and "Prometheus" --something that Damon Lindelof had in mind while writing the script but never made explicit).<br /><br />Although flawed with dumb behavior by characters, plot holes that, in this version, you could fly a spaceship through "Prometheus" still manages to be entertaining particularly if you set aside the expectations created by the hype associated with the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Man in Search of Identity"></head><body><p>Matt Damon really comes of age with The Bourne Identity.  A James Bond on Steroids like character that seems to have made the Bond series get more intense with the likes of Daniel Craig as Bond.<br /><br />There is definate passionate action here.  We see a man who is washed out at sea, with amnesia, wondering who he is and why.  Quickly he has an identity, yet too many in the form of multiple passports, and tons of cash, when he goes to a bank vault in Switzerland, that is the only form of information he has on him when he is rescued.  Things go from the darkness of not knowing who you are to a mad rush to escape seeming capture.  Not only that, he has all these amazing skills, martial arts, technical skills, ability to size up things where ever he goes.  What does it all mean?<br /><br />Additionally, as he escapes from one place where armed US Marines are chasing him, he happens along a young woman who is actually a drifter with no real place to go.  He has money, identification, but who is he, and he has an address, lets go there.  We flash back and forth from Bourne on the run and CIA headquarters, where his handlers are wondering where he had been for weeks, now he is run amok.<br /><br />Although a very violent movie from the perspective of fighting and shootings, the movie is simply not bloody or full of gore.  So, you can focus on the action and story, not the gore.  Clive Owen plays a very serious focused asset of the CIA. He is like Bourne, trained to kill.  He says very few words, and comes across as rather intense.<br /><br />Franka Potente does a great job of his unwitting accomplice who gets more and more afraid, yet intrigued as she finds herself a part of international intrigue.<br /><br />Damon, having played in a variety of less action type roles, really pulls off this one.  He still looks like a kid, yet his acting overrides his youthful look.<br /><br />The DVD has some great extras, you are taken behind the scenes with interviews of the actors as they do each part of the movie.<br /><br />More Bourne to come of course as this eventually works its way into a trilogy.</p></body></html>

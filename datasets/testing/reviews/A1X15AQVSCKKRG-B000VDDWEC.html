<meta name="summary" content="It's still a bad movie no matter how times youve seen it"></head><body><p>28 days later is without a doubt the worst movie ever made, even<br /><br />in britain or america. it is a libelious rip of the "night of the living dead, dawn of the dead, and day of the dead" trilogy that i am surprised george romero didn't sue for copyright infringement. but then again "28 days later" was such an awful film beyond anyone's comprehension that he didn't have to sue. no this film pretty much speaks for it's awful. horrible scripting, horrible acting, slowpacing self.<br /><br />Its no wonder why most of the people who give this film<br /><br />thumbs up are British. British people definitely are<br /><br />hard to figure out. Usually they have good taste but<br /><br />I cant fathom why would they praise garbage like this<br /><br />especially when it's as unoriginal as a Friday the 13th sequel.<br /><br />Yet some of these film critics praise "The Football Factory"<br /><br />a violent look inside Football in the UK through a bunch<br /><br />of dsyfunctional fans.<br /><br />The film's plot is that virus (yes like night of the living dead and romero's flick "the crazies") has infected many area of the uk. jim (cillian murphy) is apparently the only dumb smuck not infected along with a girl named selena (naomi harris). well from here on out these two dimwits and their friend mark now fight of zombies i mean rage people with bats and a machete. lol<br /><br />In order for the idiotic danny boyle to not appear as he is copying romero (which he does anyway), he invents a new plot in middle. see the virus infects people and takes over within 30 seconds, whereas romero's zombies start reacting after an hour or so of being dead.<br /><br />We get some shots of london and manchester but those shots didnt matter as the film is a mess. not even an entertaining mess, its just plain doggy doo.<br /><br />There is another rip of "dawn of the dawn" when jim, selena and their new friends frank and hannah, scourged and plunger an abandonded supermarket to their hearts contents. this is reminiscent of the abandonded shopping plaza where the "survivors" exploit the plaza while the zombies on the outside are trying to get in. what a rip. another scenes that rips of romero is where boyle for shock value has a young boy who has the disease attack jim. the scene ends with jim getting a baseball bat and killing the boy. this was<br /><br />a bit of copy of the dead films like the first one where we see the first zombie  girl in a zombie movie (the girl kills her mothers, then girl is killed herself).<br /><br />Well the copying of Romero doesn't end there because Jim and others find a military complex which is really an abandonded plaza where Major West (Christopher Eccleston), an arrogant military commander attacks the rage people.<br /><br />Well the rip here is that West like Dr. Logan (from Day) has a zombie, I mean rage person on a leach trying to the dead thing new tricks. LOL My god as you can very well see "28 Days Later" is a such rip of the great Romero it ain't funny. However, it's such a poor ripoff  of the work of Romero that the movie fails at every level.<br /><br />There is hardly any suspense, until the last 10 minutes, the characters are horrible including Jim who by God is one of the ugliest actors I've seen. The ending is cheesy and dumb.<br /><br />Mr. Cillian Murphy and others do such a poor job of acting that it's hard to fathom that this guy will play a big lead in the next Batman movie ("Batman Begins").<br /><br />Don't fall for the lies of the critics that say 28 Days Later is a good movie, it's not, it's horrible.I went to see this horrible ripoff with low expectations and I came away still in awe that such a bad movie could be made.<br /><br />There is no more to say or add to this review of "28 Days Later" than to say it's horrible, horribly done by a European director, and poses a black eye to any future horror directors from the UK.<br /><br />At least George Romero can still rest comfortably that his great work of the "Dead" trilogy will not be eclipsed by any wannabee horror directors anytime soon.<br /><br />I didnt mind the copying so much if the movie had a great<br /><br />payoff sadly it never does some people may bash this opinion<br /><br />but it doesnt change the fact that its an awful film unworthy<br /><br />or your energy.</p></body></html>

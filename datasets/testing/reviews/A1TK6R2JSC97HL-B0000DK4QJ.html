It's 2054, and Cruise is Anderton, an emotionally scarred (and substance abusing) detective assigned to an elite detail called "Pre-Crime".  Using human oracles called "Pre-cogs", Anderton receives visual clues to murders that haven't occurred yet - clues of the crime come in disconnected, dreamlike scenes.  The "pre-cogs"- two men and a woman, each ironically named for a famous mystery author - are accidents of nature and the addictions of their mothers.  (Their power is something of a curse: the pre-cogs' life boils down to floating in some sensory deprivation tank while involuntarily channeling repeated episodes of grisly murders).  The pre-cogs are themselves victims of a sort and, being the crucial elements of Pre-Crime, can't expect help from the cops.  It's not clear how the pre-cogs work, but the fact that there are only three of them - and the female "Agatha" is linchpin - implies that Pre-Crime is on shaky ground (aside from the dubious morality of arresting and imprisoning people for crimes they haven't actually committed). Pre-Crime effectively deters premeditated murder (which can be detected up to 4 days ahead of time), leaving Anderton and his crew with crimes of passion which, being spontaneous, are only detected hours (at best) ahead of the fact.  "Pre-Criminals" are given "Halos" - headsets that put them to sleep until they can be placed in a more permanent form of suspended animation (due process, like law enforcement, works ahead of the crime, so that "punishment" is immediate).  <p>Anderton is already in trouble when the story starts - though professionally respected, he's scarred by his son's disappearance years before, an event that wrecked his marriage and turned him into a career hog who jogs through the worst parts of old D.C. and buys his illegal drugs from the homeless and hopeless that stubbornly inhabit the future.  Nevertheless, the Pre-Cogs keep Anderton too preoccupied to dwell on his horrible past.  When Agatha mysteriously beams visions of a long past (and "Pre-Solved" crime) Anderton unwisely digs deeper.  Before he can dig deep enough, the Pre-Cogs get another vision - one of a man nobody has ever heard of losing his life to man nobody in Pre-Crime can forget: Anderton himself.  Now Anderton must run, knowing full well that nobody - once tagged by Pre-Crime - can ever run far or fast enough.  Instead, he tries to stay out long enough to learn how Pre-Cogs work.  Tracking down their mysterious "engineer", Anderton will learn a shocking truth: Pre-Cogs, while never wrong, will, on occasion, disagree.  Because this happens so rarely (tell that to the poor sap who gets haloed anyway) instances of "pre-cog cognitive dissonance" (okay, I made that up) are called "Minority Reports".  Convinced he was set up and that a minority report exists that will clear him, Anderton uses every trick he knows to elude capture and also sneak back into Pre-Crime, the only place he can conceivably find his own minority report.<p>Though visually cool and perfectly starpowered (I don't hate Tom Cruise movies), you can't get past "Minority Report"'s biggest flaw - it's a thriller that doesn't thrill.  The film tries to work like a mystery (the Pre-Cogs don't solve the crimes, only present cryptic clues to those that haven't occurred - old fashioned detective work is still crucial) but frustrates itself.  Nevertheless, the script is stubbornly un-thrilling - piecing together clues before it gives itself a chance to appreciate what the clues are.  Rather than give our hero the tools to solve the crime, the film just tosses the clues together.  The mystery is thus solved less by the intelligence of its characters than its compulsion to fill in its own gaps.  By the time Anderton has confronted his purported victim-to-be, you're more likely to have "pre-cogged" the twist ending yourself.  What's left is too reminiscent of "No Way Out" (man who can implicate those in power is himself implicated in a crime) and, even more unfortunately, the first "Mission Impossible" (Cruise must sneak back to his own headquarters) suffering by comparison to each.  Showing that there's still some Kurbick left over after "A.I." Spielberg liberally sprinkles his story with all sorts of weirdoes meant to herald the end of human civilization: to elude the cops, Anderton has his eyes replaced by a seedy underworld doctor played by Peter Stormare (Hollywood's hardest working character actor); Pre-Crime prisoners are kept in upright coffins and stored in a cross between a prison and a morgue, presided over by a certifiable weirdo who plays a church organ and refers to his inmates as "his flock"; the Pre-Cogs' caretaker evinces an apparently unprofessional interest in Agatha; the Pre-Cogs themselves are the result of their parents' drug addiction.  But these characters do less to advance or detail the plot than merely confirm a dark opinion of humanity (like the guys who ran the "Flesh Fair" in "A.I." or the lawyer who gets chomped in "Jurassic" - they exist only to remind us how much humanity has it coming to them).  If "Minority" doesn't excel as a thriller or sci-fi epic, it's nevertheless immensely satisfying as both.</p></body></html>

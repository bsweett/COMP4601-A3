This was the first animated movie ever, and who knows if animation would ever be around if Mr. Walt Disney hadn't. And the has been a lot of animated movies that came out since, (too many to count) and Mr. Disney was around for most of them until his death in 1966. As the movie opens, a book opens and tells what happens to Snow White before the book is not seen. Every day Snow White's (Adriana Caselotti) stepmother the queen (Lucille La Verne) askes her magic mirror (Moroni Olsen) who the fairest in the land and the answer is the same every day, it is the queen, until one day when the Queen asks the same question again. But this time the mirror gives clues to Snow White. The Queen is so mad that she sents her huntsman to kill Snow White. But the Huntsman can't do it, so he tells Snow White to run away and never come back. (That part so like 1994's The Lion King). There was only one animated movie that was nomianted for best pitcure and that was Beauty and the Beast.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="And now some details on the discs themselves..."></head><body><p>... since I think everyone else here has already said all there is to say about the film.<br /><br />1-Disc DVD<br />2.40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen<br />English DD5.1 Surround<br />French and Spanish DD2.0 Stereo<br />English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles<br />Extended and Alternate Scenes<br />Nation's Pride - the film within the film can be seen in its entirety<br />Domestic and International Trailers<br /><br />2-Disc DVD - As above plus a bonus disc with the following content:<br />Roundtable discussion with Quentin Tarantino, Brad Pitt and film historian/critic Elvis Mitchell<br />The Making of Nation's Pride<br />The Original Inglorious Bastards - a salute to the original 1978 film<br />A conversation with veteran actor Rod Taylor<br />Rod Taylor on Victoria Bitters, the Australian beer<br />Quentin Tarantino's Camera Angel<br />Hi Sallys - Gag Reel<br />Film Poster Gallery Tour with Elvis Mitchell<br />Inglourious Basterds Poster Gallery<br />Digital Copy<br /><br />Blu-ray Disc - Includes the same extras as the 2-Disc SE DVD plus BD-Live functionality. Features include:<br />1080P 2.40:1 Widescreen<br />English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio<br />French and Spanish 5.1 DTS Surround<br />English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles<br /><br />I normally review classic releases as I have little use for the nonsense that passes for modern film. However, this year I went to see and greatly enjoyed both this film and "Up". They were safe bets since Tarantino seldom disappoints and this has got to be his second best effort yet. He'll just never top Pulp Fiction in my book. For great pacing and characters that would be cartoonish in the hands of lesser directors but believable and interesting in the hands of Tarantino, I highly recommend this film. It is worth owning and rewatching.</p></body></html>

The character Tom Stall (portrayed by Vigo) became more and more interesting as the tallies of personal viewings went onward and upward, and the little things Cronenberg brought to the table were much more amazing than I first thought. The ideals denoted in a simple array of light and dark, the layers of persona wrapped inside a puzzle that was more interesting as it was poked at and slowly drew moths to its flame, and this seemed all-the-more promising when Eastern promises debuted.<br />Cronenberg and Mortenson; I never thought that one would act as a tributary that expressed itself through-and-through.<br /><br />In Eastern Promises, the viewer is again given a puzzle and asked to see it through by starting them off with a pregnant "woman" (her age is a sad affair in and of itself) begging for someone to help her. By the end of the day she is dead, there is an Eastern European baby that sets unclaimed, and one doctor that wonders what this all means. Helping her find footing amongst the broken pieces of this "woman's" life is a diary find amongst her thins, and the trail of breadcrumbs the book (written in a language she can not translate) leads her to some REALLY bad people with REALLY bad habits.<br />You really have to love Cronenberg's idea of what the baddies do.<br /><br />When watching Eastern Promises, I felt that the movie engaged me from the get-go and asking me deeper rooted questions along the way. It asked how far a person should go to do something they believed in, and it asked how much someone should sacrifice when dealing with all types of proverbial devils that did something you found hard to ignore. I personally liked that because, much like History of Violence, it engaged a viewer on a mainstream front and it allowed a person to question the legitimacy of the way the characters saw the world. Chronenberg likes duality of things, too, and that duality sometimes works as the stepping stones to help a viewer connect with the idea a director is portraying. Seeing the "mafia" going to town on a set of fingers and then setting up a child's party by putting balloons on a ceiling - the notion of family and the notion of loyalty may become extreme depending on the moment BUT you can see what makes it important.<br />Ideas like this become the gateway drugs that make some terrible things almost understandable and Cronenberg makes me happy with the way this comes through.<br /><br />The same can be said with the people on the masks of both horror and hero, with Vigo leading the way and really pulling off his role. When I heard that he would be adding "accent" to the role I was somewhat afraid, knowing how he had done a lot of things well but not really envisioning him wearing a chilling vocal overcoat cast of the Eastern European persuasion, but he as amazing as it did so. Equally impressive was the persona he took on; tattooed to the gills and seemingly Siberian in the cold manner with which he went about his work, he sold the role and added in feelings I was unaccustomed to in that type of killer. The rest of the cast was solid as well, making the world Cronenberg crafted one that I could see existing.<br /><br />Well worth seeing, gory plus story plus a little something-something that detaches digits at an alarming speed; to me that's everything a Holiday tale requires and especially so when you tire of the tinsel and the Carolers and all that other frill.</p></body></html>

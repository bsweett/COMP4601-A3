I am even a fan of the movies where he plays very small roles, such as:  The Jackel, and Anchorman.  He always makes a big impression to me, no matter how small the role.<br /><br />I thought I would love this movie. I rented it sight unseen, not even looking at the reviews here, in Amazon.com.  I sure wish I had.  This movie was so boring.  Borrrrring.<br /><br />It was so bad, I didn't even view it without the commentary.  I watched about 15 minutes of it, with the normal audio track, and almost fell asleep.  I then chose to watch the whole movie with the commentary with Jack Black and the director, and this was much more interesting than the actual movie.<br /><br />l think this movie was mis-marketed as well.  I can't believe that Jack Black was supposed to be Mexican.  Come on.  I think the story-line would have been much more believable, if he was some sort of loser foreign worker, who came in as a "ringer" for a Mexican wrestling organization.  I understand that they don't want to have the whole movie in Spanish with subtitles, but having Jack speak with no accent, and all of his co-actors speaking with Mexican accents?  Na ahh.  MC White ain't buying it.<br /><br />This one sucked out my will to watch.<br /><br />MC White said:  It sucked!</p></body></html>

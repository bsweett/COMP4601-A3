<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Piece of Film"></head><body><p>The Maltese Falcon is considered the first Film-Noir ever made and is a classic and highly innovative film starring Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, and Peter Lorre. The movie is #23 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 and is written and directed by John Huston. Right from the beginning of the movie I realized how many movies this thing has inspired. The first ten minutes of the film kept bringing to mind the first ten minutes of another classic film called "Chinatown." Ironically, "Chinatown" co-starred this films director John Huston. Bogart, in one of his most famous roles, plays Sam Spade, a Private detective who is hired by Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Astor) to chase away a man her sister is dating. Spade sends his partner Archer, but Archer (and the sisters' date) is killed. But Spade smells something fishy and his sense of smell is heightened when a mysterious man named Joel Cairo (Lorre) offers him $5000 dollars to find a jewel-encrusted falcon. Frequent scenes in which Sam outsmarts or outmuscles the bad guys are hilarious. The movie's final line is one of films most famous. This film doesn't evoke the same mood and tone that I associate with "film-noir" but whatever you want to call it...It's a great film. It's very entertaining, Sam Spade is one of Bogart's greatest creations (kind of the opposite of Rick, the character he would go on to play in "Casablanca"). Peter Lorre is wonderful as Cairo, although he's not quite as bugeyed as he was in the German-classic M. For another example of how good (and important) this movie is, I must mention that you can see echoes of this film in almost any detective movie that was made after it. This is a masterpiece of cinema. Don't miss it.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

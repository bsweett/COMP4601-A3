<meta name="summary" content="Decent, but not as good as the classic"></head><body><p>"Superman Returns" starts off well - we quickly move through a lot of Superman's back story, because the filmmakers know we've all seen Christopher Reeve's original "Superman."  Indeed, the theme music is the same; Brando's footage and voice as Superman's father are repurposed; this movie clearly acknowledges that the first Superman movie happened and is meant to be placed in the same universe.  Brandon Routh does a credible Christopher Reeve; Kevin Spacey maintains the same tone as Hackman did in the original; and indeed the tone of the picture is very much that of the original "Superman."<br /><br />So why three stars?  First, there just isn't much of a story in this movie.  The first one wasn't a masterpiece of storytelling, but it had plot aplenty compared to this.  Second, "Superman Returns" lacks the iconic moments of the first movie that you remember even years after seeing the film.  Third, this movie isn't so much about Superman as it is about Lois Lane.  My wife pointed this out, and she's right.  Not that Lois Lane isn't an interesting or worthwhile character, but we want to see a movie about Superman when we are watching "Superman Returns."  Instead, Superman is the cipher at the center of this film, a sort of Oliver Twist around whom all manner of events happens, but whom we never really get to know.<br /><br />It's worth a rent, and it's better than Superman III or Superman IV.</p></body></html>

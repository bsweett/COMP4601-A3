<meta name="summary" content="If Bioterror ever happens"></head><body><p>The Trainspotting team with Danny Boyle have made another good movie. This time about what will happen to England if there is an outbreak of a very deadly virus. It could be a scenario though up by people who know a lot about bioterror although it seems to be unlikely something like this will happen. It's fact and fiction, like a horror story. The virus is passed through by blood, no strange things there, but they almost turn into zombies, and that seems unlikely.<br /><br />Someone wakes up in a deserted hospital, not knowing what happened. He finds a few people and they try to get to the neighborhood of Manchester where still some normal people are. They are not so normal after all and things turn bad.<br /><br />I haven't seen all the alternate endings and would really like to. The 'normal' version ends a little too happy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Minority Report - A great Sci-Fi flick!"></head><body><p>This is a movie that I was unfortunately unable to see at the theaters and regretted it then and even more so now, seeing how great a movie it is.  You can normally expect a Steven Spielberg film to contain; stunning imagery, intense suspense and an overly enthralling film, which he delivers perfectly in this film.  Minority Report is an absolutely riveting film that will have you going from the moment the film starts to the very last second.  Tom Cruise's more recent films really haven't really lived up to expectations, not so in this film.  He seems to be completely in his stride with this role.  He performs brilliantly in this film.  Nods to Max Von Sydow as well.  If you're into action/mystery films with a good dose of Science Fiction tossed in for good measure, this is your film.  Minority Report is a must for your DVD collection!<p>The premise:<p>It is the year 2054 and the film takes place in Washington D. C.  For the past several years, murder is all but a thing of the past.  With the advent of the Pre Crime division, where three pre-cogs, see a murder before it happens.  Tom Cruise plays the chief of the Pre Crimes division, leading the troops in the apprehension of these criminals who haven't, yet are about to commit murder.  His character is plagued by the murder of his son, six years prior and is suffering the emotional damage from that murder.  The pre-cogs, foretell a murder and as Tom Cruise is working his amazing futuristic computer to discover who the murderer is, he finds that it is he who is the murderer.  And so goes the film as he makes his way out of the Pre Crime building and starts on his quest to figure out who has set him up.</p></body></html>

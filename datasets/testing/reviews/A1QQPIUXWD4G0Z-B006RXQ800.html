<meta name="summary" content="A Film With Overdone Stereotypes and Cliches"></head><body><p>Tale of survival and vengeance in the ethnically divided burroughs of 1860s New York where Leonardo DiCaprio seeks to avenge his father's killer and gang chief played by Daniel Day-Lewis.<br /><br />Certainly Scorcese brings out the smell of the tensions of the time, however, the acting and backdrops fail to bring any flavor to the story. The latter are too melodramatic and two-dimensional to bring the movie out of its Hollywood stereotype formula. Daniel Day Lewis plays his role well but the script and character is more archetypical than anything else; the characters psyche and motives aren't well explored. With so much of the film focusing on gangs and strife, one wonders why Cameron Diaz' character is included the story. The movie also has serious historical flaws as to events and the prevailing attitudes of the day.<br /><br />In the end, you feel as if you just watched an average blood-fest movie and not much else.</p></body></html>

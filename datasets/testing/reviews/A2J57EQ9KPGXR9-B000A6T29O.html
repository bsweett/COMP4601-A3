<meta name="summary" content="Worse than the last &quot;Batman&quot; film!"></head><body><p>Amazing! This film is worse than &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, one of the few films that had me running from the theatre. Bad casting (the &quot;super-weirdo&quot; Jolie as Lara Croft?? What were they thinking?), pedestrian action sequences, a bad &quot;script&quot; and a large budget mixed into an unwatchable mess. Did'nt the producers of this sewage watch any &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films to see how Tomb Raider should have been made; or even play the game?<p>To quote Leonard Pinth Garnell: &quot;Simply awful, could'nt have been worse..&quot;</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Zombie Style"></head><body><p>Rob Zombie has one of the most disturbing styles when it comes to film making. I would hate to see his nightmares! This movie definitely pushes the boundaries and I loved every minute of it. I also liked how it was totally different looking than house of 1000 corpses. Check it out, but be warned its not for the faint of heart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's Hollywood and Bruckheimer, and You Should Have Known it"></head><body><p>As it is the film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who gave us Armageddon, Con Air, and Pearl Harbor, you know what you see in King Arther. Historical accuracy? Not a chance. The Round Table? Excalibur? You see them, but not in the way you read or heard. For it is based on a newer, revised idea, which means you get lots of actions, sword fighting, and love. In short, just another over-the-top blockbuster film, and as such King Arther is not bad.<br /><br /> Now, the surprisingly non-Ameircan cast include Olive Owen as Arther; Keira Knightley as Guinevere; Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot; Stephen Dillane as Merlin; Stellan Skarsgaard as baddie Cerdic; Ray Winstone as Bors; Hugh Dancy as Galahad; Joel Edgerton as Gawain; Mads Mikkelson as Tristan; and Ray Stevenson as Dagonet.<br /><br /> The story is nothing you ever have heard in many versions of King Arthur legends. The new story is set against the background of the Roman occupation of Britain in 415 AD. King Arthur is under the command of a Roman priest, who gives Arthur and other knights another and last order to bring back a Roman aristocrartic family safe back from the enemy territory, where the Saxons led by cold-blooded Cerdic are invading.<br /><br /> Of course, it's a suicide mission, but it sounds a bit familiar, isn't it? Well, the director of this film is Antoine Faqua, who did Tears of the Sun last year, and that's no wonder. Oh, and by the way, the screenwriter of King Auther happens to be David Franzoni, one of the co-writers of Gladiator of which huge success, critically or commercially, must have spawned the new craze for the Ben-Hur type big-scale epic actions, including Troy and a forthcoming one about Alexander.<br /><br /> To be fair, the actions are done with enough power and convincing fight scenes, without splashing too much blood. At the same time, after watching Gladiator this one may look very tame. And some of the actions cannot help making us feel like, I have seen it before, and if its doesn't, well, you haven't seen Braveheart or Rob Roy.<br /><br /> I do not complain of the historical things -- anyway, it's legend -- but King Arther challenges our concept about this famous story so gratingly that you may be offended with it. You see no Camelot; Merlin does not use magic; and Guenevere takes us a weapon and shoots arrows, at times with her skins painted blue like one character in X-Men. Some say it's campy, and with good reasons. And as the illicit love with Lancelot is totally gone (hey, it's a family picture), so Gruffudd soon starts to look just like a shadow following her and Arthur.<br /><br /> If you are not surprised to see the newness of the story, you will be entertained with the actions, or the fights between the good and the evil. But as you know. you can see John Boorman-directed Excalibur which would be a better choice for some.</p></body></html>

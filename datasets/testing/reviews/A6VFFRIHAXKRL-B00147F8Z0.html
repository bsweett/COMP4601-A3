You would've thought that 20th century FOX would've learned don't hire music video directors & they give the Strause Brothers full reign but were strict on Fincher WTF. Fincher has made some movies I actually liked Strause Brothers gave us R Kelly & 50 cent music videos WTF. I like Alien, Aliens & Alien 3 they were excellent Alien Resurrection was an ok action movie. Predator 1 classic survival horror Predator 2 comes pretty close. These movies shouldn't be that hard to make You have a planet overran by Aliens a space crew like the 1st movie gets a distress signal & they respond another ship with Predators responds to it too or do the same thing just have Predators result 1st then some marines go in 2nd. FOX you should've adapted Peter Briggs's script. Stay the f**K away from AvP & AVPR  they have B list written all over it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very funny dark humor with a brilliant plot"></head><body><p>Well, how compromised can the morality of a story be and still be funny?  This story is not about smoking, but about lobbying for the smoking industry (and alcohol and guns and ...).  The compromises are on every side of this story.  The politicians who uses causes and principles as poses for re-election, the family members who want to distance themselves from the lobbyist standing up for the "bad" thing, but still willing to live well off of the proceeds.  It is also about all the lies we tell ourselves and the excuses we make because we "have to pay the mortgage".<br /><br />Nick Naylor (great name for the character, huh?) is a lobbyist for the tobacco industry and is at the top of his game.  The movie opens up with him on the Joan Lunden show with a whole host of anti-smoking folks including a teenage boy dying of cancer.  Nick turns it around by explaining to the audience that the tobacco industry wants the boy to get well and live so he can continue to smoke.  It is the anti-smoking government agency who profits with a bigger budget if the boy dies.<br /><br />Naylor is divorced.  His ex-wife is living in what used to be his house with their son, Joey, and her boyfriend.  When Nick goes to career day and greets Joey on the way to the front, the boy whispers a plea begging Nick to not ruin his childhood.<br /><br />I don't want to take away the enjoyment of discovering this wonderful plot from you, but one of the great bits in the story is the weekly lunch Nick has with his friends who are lobbyists for the liquor and gun industries.  Together, they call themselves the MOD Squad (Merchants of Death).  One of their ongoing debates is who is responsible for the most deaths.<br /><br />In the end, while things move on, they don't really get much better.  Some things are learned, but the world remains what it is even if the cast changes a bit.  But it was a fun ride.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there is NO smoking in the movie.  There are quite a number of uses of the f-word and other swearing - so keep that in mind.  And since there is a plot twist that involves Nick having an unwise affair, there are some sexual situations, but no nudity.<br /><br />A fine cast with some pretty big name stars (Robert Duvall, Sam Elliott, William H. Macy, with Aaron Eckhart as the Beaver - I mean Nick).<br /><br />Enjoy the shenanigans.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A film made transcendent by utterly brilliant lead performance"></head><body><p>Is Daniel Day-Lewis the best actor in the world?  Given his reluctance to make many films this is a difficult question to answer.  Certainly there is no actor today of whom we expect truly extraordinary things on the rare occasions he does make a major movie.  Despite having turned in several unforgettable performances over the years of almost inconceivable range -- just contrast his effeminate fop in ROOM WITH A VIEW with his sexy Tomas in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING with his Hawkeye as ultimate action hero in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS with his wheelchair bound Christy Brown in MY LEFT FOOT (for which he justifiably won his first Oscar) with his unfairly accused political prisoner in IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (second Oscar nomination) with the brutal Bill the Butcher in THE GANGS OF NEW YORK (third Oscar nomination).  Which is the real Daniel Day-Lewis?  None of them?  All of them?  What is so intensely exciting about Day-Lewis as an actor is how completely he becomes who he is playing.  It is hard to imagine him being different than he is in the film.  He is famous for the degree to which he stays "in character" during the filming of a movie.  I can only imagine that it takes him several days if not weeks to come down from wherever he has to exist while performing a role.<br /><br />I saw THERE WILL BE BLOOD the night before the Oscars.  The Academy Awards frequently not only get things wrong, but also do so in quite stupid ways.  They have a long history of this.  Remember, neither Alfred Hitchcock nor Barbara Stanwyck ever won Oscars, nor did Ernst Lubitsch nor Cary Grant, not did . . . and the list could go on forever.  But I left the theater completely convinced that for once a performance was so astonishing that not even the often absurd Oscars could get this one wrong.  Nor did they.  In fact, if you could do a winners competition among the Oscar winners, Day-Lewis might beat out all the other winners this decade for a sort of Super Oscar.  I don't remember the last time I saw a performance this amazing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm not convinced the rest of the movie is as good as Day-Lewis.  I give it five stars, but I wonder if it is the masterpiece many are proclaiming it.  I'll share my doubts later in the review.  There were many things I loved in the film.  I don't remember the last time I loved an incidental sound track like I did this one (though of course, a film like ONCE, where the music was central to the whole film, is a completely different matter -- one of the other things I loved at this year's Oscars was Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova winning an Oscar of their own).  The music was sometimes lyrical, but more often it was atmospheric, generating an almost visceral reaction.  ONCE aside, this may have been the movie from 2007 whose music I most enjoyed.<br /><br />And visually this was a delight.  Shot after shot was a complete delight.  Even today, several days after having seen the movie, a host of brilliant images come to mind.  The bare, sparse, almost ascetic sets were haunting.  I especially love the beginning of the film.  It must have been at least 15 to 20 minutes into the film before the first word was spoken.  Yet during that time we learn so much about Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) and the world he inhabits.  It is brutal, demanding, and dangerous work.<br /><br />Obviously Paul Thomas Anderson means the film in a topical way.  I actually read many, many years ago Upton Sinclair's OIL, the book upon which this film was loosely based.  Sinclair was, of course, an ardent socialist, a position I'm not at all out of sympathy with.  Like Sinclair and, apparently, Anderson, I agree that capitalism is a very dangerous, extraordinarily unproductive economic system.  Well, it is productive for those at the top, but not for most of the people within that economy.  But my complaints are far more specific, with the delusions of the free marketers (if the free marketers ever bothered to actually read Adam Smith they would discover that he is not a free marketer, since he believed that there should be many moral limits placed on economic enterprise -- in other words, Smith felt that government might need to intervene in an economy, something the most ardent free marketers would deny).  Now I go into this in a tiny bit of detail to contrast it with what THERE WILL BE BLOOD says about capitalism, which is:  capitalism is bad.  There is no subtlety in the depiction of Plainview as a capitalist.  We see that in the end it leaves neither the exploiter nor the exploited happy, but is that because there is something messed up on the system?  Or is it simply because Plainview is a sociopath?<br /><br />Anderson strikes out against the second great blight on American life today.  If free market utopians have destroyed the economic well being of most Americans by their promises that if we just stick with the market, all will benefit (embodied in various trickle down theories -- but as one of Plainview's contemporaries, Will Rogers, liked to explain, gold isn't, like many assume, like water.  If you put it at the top of a pile, it doesn't trickle down to everything below.  Nope, Gold is like Gold.  Put it at the top and it just stays there).  But the second blight on American life is clearly a politicized fundamentalist Christianity.  If Anderson aims one barrel of his shotgun at capitalist exploiters, the other is at false religious leaders.  The two forces clash for the length of the film, until literally coming to blows at the end.  But again, apart from just throwing Eli's hypocritical preacher out there as a symbol of the emptiness of religion gone bad, nothing is either said or even hinted at on a deeper level.  We all know that there are charlatan preachers.  We know there are religious demagogues like James Dobson and Pat Robertson.  Just as Plainview says nothing about capitalism in general, so Eli says nothing about religion in general.  They are paraded out as symbols, but their symbolism is never truly investigated.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if this is not a deep film, it is on the surface of things a brilliant one.  There are so many great moments.  The scene in which Plainview converts to Christianity in order to get the rights to take his pipeline across the property of one old crank is as unforgettable as any scene you'll ever encounter.<br /><br />By the way, the line from the film that is quickly becoming one of the most famous from any recent film - "I drink your milkshake" - comes, according to an interview I heard with Paul Thomas Anderson, from testimony that Senator Albert Fall gave during the Teapot Dome Scandal.  Fall was explaining about "drainage," drilling at an angle to take oil that is below the surface of someone else's land.  (Not that I'm trying to justify Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but what precipitated that invasion was precisely Kuwait's stealing Iraq's oil by drilling at a sharp angle at their border into Iraqi oil reserves.  Iraq actually had a legitimate complaint against Kuwait, though I'm sure no one believes that this justified their invading the smaller country.)  Anderson claimed - I have not independently verified this - that Fall used the same image as that in the film.  Namely, "If you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake, and my straw reaches all across the room, then I drink your milkshake."  Though Anderson also admits he embellished the line a bit.  No question that Daniel Day-Lewis sold the line.<br /><br />But in the end, there is one main reason for seeing this film:  Daniel Day-Lewis.  Before I saw this I would have put him on the shortest of short lists of the great actors of his age.  Now I truly think he stands alone.</p></body></html>

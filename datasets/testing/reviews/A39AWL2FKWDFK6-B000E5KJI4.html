<meta name="summary" content="A plodding Greek history"></head><body><p>Wolfgang Petersen's "Troy" certainly was a spectacle in magnitude in the same vein as classic movies with ancient history themes like Ben Hur, The Robe and Spartacus.  The movie was visually stunning, however, it was far too long in duration and at times boring.  History purists will cringe at the liberties taken with Homer's "The Iliad". <p>The acting for the most part was adequate.  Veteran actor Peter O'Toole playing Trojan king Priam excelled and might walk off with a long overdue Oscar.  I had no problem with a buffed Brad Pitt as a pensive and brooding Achilles.  Eric Bana playing Hector gave a commendable performance.  Rose Byrne did well as Breisis and was more attractive than Diane Kruger, the gal who launched a thousand ships, Helen.  Brian Cox as Agamemnon was obnoxious but on second thought maybe he was meant to be.  Orlando Bloom, terrific in Pirates of the Caribbean was awful and miscast playing a wimpy Paris, prince of Troy.<p>Troy had potential to be much better but alas even with today's technical advances, they don't make movies like they used to.</p></body></html>

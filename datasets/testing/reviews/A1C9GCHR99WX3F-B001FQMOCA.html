<meta name="summary" content="Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash"></head><body><p>Is it just me, or has biography movies about singers have gotten pretty popular in the last couple of years? First we had Ray, then Beyond the Sea, and now we have Walk the Line, and I am only counting the movies that I can think of, that has come out starting in 2004, even through I do know there has been a lot more movies like this. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they both do thier own singing in this movie, rather in some other movies where they either get somebody to come in and to the singing, with the actor lip synching, or even lip synching to the singer's records such in Ray. And who knows what other movies that we see of musical bio picks, and who will play the role, and will they do thier own singing, or lip synching, either to recordings, or whoemver they get to do the singing voice. The movie begins in 1968, when Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is about to do a live concert in a prison. The name of the prison is Folsom Prison, and then we flash back 24 years earlier, when we meet 12 years old (Ridge Canipe) and his older brother Jack (Lucas Till), who live a life on a farm. Jack spends his time with the bible, Johnny listening to singers including June Carter on the radio, thier father ((Robert Patrick) drinks, and thier mother (Shelby Lynne) retreats into gospel standards from the Heavenly Highway Hymnal. But then saddness hits the family, when Jack is killed in a circular-saw accident. And there father says that god took the wrong boy. And then we flash to 1955, when Johnny Cash is married to his high school sweetheart Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin). Johnny Cahs so goes by Sun Studios where he sees aritists pefroming, and decides to become a singer, and even tries out for Sam Philips (Dallas Roberts), and  hits the road, where seen in cameos are Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice), Waylon Jennings (Shooter Jennings), and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne). And then soon he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and then he falls in love with her, and tries to win her over. And like I said before Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon does all thier own singing, and not only that, Joaquin also learned how to play guitar for this movie, if you love bio pics, or anybody in the movie, or a big Johnny or June Carter Cash fans, then this is a must for you to add to your list.</p></body></html>

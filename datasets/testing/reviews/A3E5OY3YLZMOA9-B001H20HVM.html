What seems to scare people more than fake scary movies or make believe characters are people that are real and stories that feel even realer. In Saw it feels more possible for this to be done and this creates more fear and more thinking than you would get from a traditional scary movie. If you ask me Saw 2 is just as good as the first with the same intelligent but sadistic games. It's so good that you even start to get the message that trying to be passed by Jigsaw. In this one some of your questions are answered like what happened to the guys left in the room at the end of the last film and what will happen when Jigsaw's time is up.</p></body></html>

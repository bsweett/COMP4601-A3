<meta name="summary" content="The complexity of power"></head><body><p>Love it, hate it, or be indifferent, Citizen Kane is clearly an American Classic. It holds such power in the cinema world due to the immensity of its themes - ego, the will to power, the American Dream silver trail from poverty to immense wealth, the overarching power and instability of the media, the effect of women and men on each other. It is a contender for the Great American Movie - just like the parallel battle for Great American Novel. This is something only realy done in the USA. No one speaks of the Great British Movie, or the Great European Movie - the same paradigm just doesn't seem to appear for the more varied, fragmented film industries over here. But in America you have to strive to be the best, the greatest. Orson Welles, a fledgling director and star knew he was grappling with something immense here, and he holds true course well throughout. The movie is a compelling jigsaw puzzle plot with fantastically original cinematography (for its time, though there is a big debt to early Hitchcock), that slots in place revelations about a complex, turbulent character of a paragon of the Great American Male. The rewards are immense - but the sacrificies can be ruinous. And what use are all those gilded possessions in the end when they're carted away and burned? The ego is fragile, consciousness transient, and everyone knows how even the greatest stories must end eventually.</p></body></html>

Perhaps the most glaring discrepancy is with the acting.  In particular, Gregory Peck and Lee Remick were outstanding in their respective roles as Mr. and Mrs. Robert Thorn...you simply do not have this caliber of acting in the remake.  For all intents and purposes, the remake of "The Omen" fails to stack up to the original.  In fact, the remake almost follows the original movie in every way with a few minor deviations and superfluous additions, but the problem is that the original did it perfectly the first time around so there was no way to improve upon the original.  Still, it's a great story and is probably worth viewing if you have any interest in the subject matter.  However, with that being said, I highly recommend the original over this inferior remake.</p></body></html>

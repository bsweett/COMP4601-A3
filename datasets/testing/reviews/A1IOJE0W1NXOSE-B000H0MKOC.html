<meta name="summary" content="Clever satire"></head><body><p>Nick Naylor is the Vice-President for the Institute of Tobacco studies, in other words the "spin Dr." who speaks for the tobacco industry in an attempt to counteract studies which have shown that tobacco is harmful to your health.  In the opening scene, he appears on a t.v. show and makes a Vermont senator and others look ridiculous for suggesting that people should not smoke.  Like a magician, Nick distracts the audience with a seemingly true statement while managing to twist what others say.  On the other side of the coin is Nick's young son who lives with his mother, but still considers his father to be "a god" (in the words of Nick's estranged wife.)  Nick's dilemma is how to keep both sides satisfied while, as he puts it, he manages to "pay the mortgage".  This movie is a fresh and clever satire, well-acted by Aaron Echhart and his supporting cast.  It is a refreshing change from many of the trite and predictable movies which are currently produced in Hollywood.</p></body></html>

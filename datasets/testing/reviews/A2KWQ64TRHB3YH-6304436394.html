Depp wants Bandaras to kill a man who is planning to assassinate a Mexican president. Bandaras accepts the job because he wants revenge. We are not told during the first half of the film why. We are also kept in dark for a long while why Bandaras gave up being a gunman and what he was doing since he abandoned this profession. The movie is filled with action, most of it appears impossible, which makes it more dramatic, and with strange characters, which adds humor.</p></body></html>

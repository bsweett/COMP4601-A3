So close to the reality of the time that the humor of the movie lies more in how closely it reflects the political and military thinking of the Cold War: hence the satire.<br /><br />Sterling Hayden delivers an impeccable performance as General Jack D. Ripper, the psychotically paranoid Air Force general who orders a preemptive nuclear strike by a B-52 squadron on the U.S.S.R. Peter Sellers is brilliant in his triple role as the U.S. President, Dr. Strangelove, and Mandrake. George C. Scott also tops the cake in his over-the-top caricature of the Pattonesque General Buck Turgidson. It's hard to describe all of the nuances of this film on such a short review: you have to see it for yourself. Although the film will certainly have more of an impact on those who are old enough to remember the Cold War and all its tensions: there's a universal message in this satire that isn't bound to just that period of time.<br /><br />As a side note, this film isn't far from the truth as the Soviets had, by 1964, indeed developed a doomsday device. Under Stalin's rule, the USSR was planning to dock several grounded tanker ships filled to the decks with nuclear material. The ships would automatically detonate and consume the earth in radiation once they detected a level of radiation that could only be present as a result of nuclear war. Horrified by the possibility of accidents and human error, Nikita Kruskev ordered the project scrapped and it was never implemented.</p></body></html>

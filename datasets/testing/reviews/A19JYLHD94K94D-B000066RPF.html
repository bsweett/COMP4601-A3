With the Flying Circus behind them, however, and John Cleese already starting to work on his own project with his wife (Fawlty Towers), Monty Python decided to take that chance, and it proved to be worth it, mainly due to the fact that Monty Python and the Holy Grail looks more like a collection of skits than a single story; any attempt to follow the storyline will be quite disappointing. However, almost every scene is brilliant by itself, and the movie provides some of the most memorable moments and one-liners in comedy history.<p>The perfect timing and team work of the Monty Python crew, which made 'Flying Circus' one of the most popular shows in history, was transferred well to the big screen. Additional actors were kept to a minimum, so each of the Pythonists played several parts. As usual, the casting is wonderful, and each of the six actors brings life to all his characters, as each one gets one or two great scenes to show what he has to offer. Graham Chapman was given the role of the straight man (sort of like Zeppo Marx only funnier) and does a great job in the part of King Arthur, as well as an unforgettable short appearence as God (&quot;Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy...&quot;) Terry Gilliam is, as usual, not given a very big part in the movie, but does a great work on his very few lines as both Patsy, Arthur's trusty steed (&quot;It's only a model.&quot;) and the keeper of the Bridge of Death, as well a short appearence as himself (The Animator). His animation sequences on this movie are his absolute best. Director Terry Jones does a wonderful Sir Bedevere, supplying the brilliant witch scene, as well as the unforgettable Prince Herbert. Michael Palin is a great Sir Galahad, but is more memorable as Dennis (&quot;Help! Help! I'm being repressed!&quot;) and of course the leader of the Knights Who Say Ni. Eric Idle is dreadfuly funny as usual as Sir Robin, and also as Roger the Srubber, Brother Maynard, the Dead Collector (&quot;Bring out your dead!&quot;) and Concorde. And most of all, John Cleese, making not only a wonderful Sir Launcelot, but also supply some of the film's most memorable moments as the newt guy, Tim the Wizard, the rude French soldier and of course the Black Knight (&quot;It's just a flesh wound!&quot;)<p>The comedic work of the Monty Python team, their scripts and their timing are flawless. Python's humor is one that works on familiarity and not on surprise, and so I still enjoy it after watching it about twenty times - it's the perfect kind of thing to own on video. Get the Holy Grail, as well as Life Of Brian, And Now For Something Completely Different, and Meaning Of Life. They  will become your most precious earthly posessions.</p></body></html>

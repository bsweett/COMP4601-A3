<meta name="summary" content="Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is mesmerizing and poignant"></head><body><p>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is Lee Ang's one of the most visionary and laudable efforts since Ice Storm and Sense and Sensibility. The movie boasts an well-ensembled cast with sublime performances especially from the feisty Jen (Zhang Ziyi) and the subtle, mellow Mu Bai (Chow Yuen Fatt). It is an epic of swordsplay in virtuoso and the bitter legendary world where honor collides with passion, obligations and trust. At first glance, it is not difficult to notice its prime attractions - beautiful cinematography from the award-winning Peter Pau and the energetic and sleek martial arts movements supervised by Yuen Wo Ping (The Matrix). However, it defies categorisation of the Wuxia fable to reach deep and dissect each character's emotional trauma and restraint. Michelle Yeoh is casted as Yu Shu Lien, a dignified swordswoman whose destiny criss-crossed with the infamous &quot;Green Destiny&quot;. There she joins forces with Li to find the sword - only to be obstructed by Jen, who aims for power in the Wuxia world. <p>Lee Ang's adaptation of the fable by Wang Du Lu focuses distinctly on the character's development. Jen is trapped by the betrayal of her mentor and her duties to her family; the dramatic tragedy of unrequited romance between Li and Yu - their fates are intertwined by the sword which is the centrestage of the movie. It is at once a human drama tinged with bittersweet regrets for the warring hearts. Enhanced by the poetry of the cinematography and the enchanting score by Tao Dun, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon can probably roar and spear ahead in the race for Oscar. It is unequivocally the most refreshing piece of work this year.</p></body></html>

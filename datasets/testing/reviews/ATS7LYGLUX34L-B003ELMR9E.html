<meta name="summary" content="Average Film Elevated By Its Stars"></head><body><p>I loved the original Insomnia, so I was kind of worried that Hollywood would destroy another foreign film by remaking it. On that count, Insomnia is a success: The film works on all of the same levels as the original.....but it just didn't involve me in the same way.<p>  The story is pretty straightforward: Two L.A. Cops are brought to Alaska, ostensibly to help solve a murder, but the reality is they were sent away to get them out of the spotlight of an Internal Affairs investigation that could drag them both down. While trying to snare the killer, the stakeout goes horribly awry, and cop and killer become drawn together by the secret knowledge of what happened. <p>  The performances are great. Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, and Nicky Katt are all great actors. The problem is, the story just doesn't seem compelling enough on it's own. The actors are the only thing sustaining interest. It's also riddled with bad-tv cliches: Evidence is found by accident, days after dozens of people turned the beach upside-down and found nothing, the killer opens a drawer in his house, allowing a cop to see evidence that can implicate him (oops!), Pacino even gets the location of Williams' hideout from the jacket of a book he'd written! Come ON.....sloppy writing!<p>  The film is worth seeing, if you're a fan of any of these actors. Otherwise, try the original. You won't regret it.</p></body></html>

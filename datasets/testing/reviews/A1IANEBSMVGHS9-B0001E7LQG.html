<meta name="summary" content="Predictable yet enjoyable"></head><body><p>I don't know if it's fair to call this movie a chick flick. It can be considered so every bit as much as Mel Gibson's "What Women Want": it is a chick flick with a twist, where the chauvinistic "highly coveted" bachelor is redempted from his world... well, sorta!<p>The movie is quite predictable: there are some sex scenes; romantic moments with french music, wine and the beach, and tales of heartbreak and reconciliation. For such a repeated plot, you probably wouldn't give the movie too much credit, but except for a few moments, the movie is actually saved by the performances of the two leads, mostly Diane Keaton, who played a brilliant part that will make you laugh real hard.<p>I don't think it's "the worse movie ever" or some other categorizations it's received like that, but there are far better movies (and stories) out there (if you want to dig into the theme, do pick up the Gibson flick I mentioned earlier -you're bound to like it even more). Overall, I give it 3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

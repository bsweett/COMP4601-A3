<meta name="summary" content="The Patriot should be called "The Wussy""></head><body><p>We know from repeated allusions to a particularly horrific Indian Wars battle that Mel Gibson's character feels very badly about his involvement in that battle. He won't tell his kids and he refuses to accept any honor or mention from other citizens with regard to that time.<br /><br />He is essentially a pacifist now. Then one of his boys is murdered by British troops and he goes into a berserker rage. Well, heck yes! And the way he goes after his revenge is sweet! It is deserving and justified.<br /><br />Then he sort of wimps out. Oh sure, he had the fire and fury to murder all the troops who were taking orders to do the unjustified actions, but when he finally gets a chance to go after the commanding officer who actually and quite literally murdered his son (and subsequently murdered another son and many many others at his order), well ol' Mel's character seems to have wimped out.<br /><br />Why is this? Is it Mel's fault? Yeah, in part it is. He's more than a bankable star. He can greenlight films and he certainly has creative control over just about any picture he's involved with. So why didn't Gibson's character get sweet revenge against this British officer? Who the heck knows?<br /><br />I do know that the battle in which he kills that officer is less than fulfilling and certainly nothing less than a standard battle scene.<br /><br />I can assure you that if my sons were murdered and the wives and children of my friends were burned alive, I'd be living large with a murderous rage - and since this is the Revolutionary War, Gibson's character would have too.<br /><br />The film is well developed and over all, effective, but the climactic final scene is anything but climactic or satisfying. It's almost as if the film starts out with conviction and then by the end of the film, we are being fed some sort of PC crap that "we should take the higher ground and be humane". Well screw that! After almost two hours of this evil Brit torturing and murdering, he deserves far more justice than Gibson's character delivers with a quick sword blow.<br /><br />This calls for a Shakespearian ending and instead we get an ending just the other side of "touchy feely'.<br /><br />Annoying to say the least.</p></body></html>

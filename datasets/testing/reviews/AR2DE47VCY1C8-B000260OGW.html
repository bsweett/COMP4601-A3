<meta name="summary" content="Ranks right up there with the Culpepper Cattle Company"></head><body><p><p><br />I come from a long line of Westerners, and for &quot;that's really the way it was,&quot; I think the Culpepper Cattle Company beats them all.  Lonesome Dove is high on my list, too.  Open Range is right up there in that company.  There were a couple others, where you got the idea that the writer might actually have been West of the Mississippi at some time in his life for a day or two.<p><p>The thing I liked about this one is that it brought back memories of many old Western towns I've been in, with dirt streets that became mud in a rain, plank sidewalks and a feeling that seemed genuine.  Of course, I'm 75 and my grandmother came West on the Oregon Trail.<p><p>There were no heroics involving fast draws, with two guys facing each other in the middle of the street, twitching their butts and waiting for the other guy to make their move and all the rest of the Hollywood nonsense.  And the firearms:  they actually showed Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) carrying a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3, instead of a Colt.<p><p>For a rundown on the plot, read Joe Haschka's review.  It's right on the money.  But, it's refreshing to me to see a somewhat reasonable portrayal of the late nineteenth century West.  I get so tired of Hollywood's version of the West, sometimes.  When they show the unending violence of the &quot;Wild West,&quot; people tend to believe it was like that.  In actual fact, the Eastern cities were far more violent than the West ever was, with their gangs of thugs like the &quot;Bowery Boys,&quot; the mixed races and nationalities hating each other, and the political corruption.  Compared to the East, the West was tame!<p><p>But, they have to have violence to make a story--at least Hollywood clearly thinks so.  How long has it been since you saw a movie without gunplay (and all the actors claim to hate guns)<br />or auto chases that appear to endanger everyone in sight?<p><p>Costner not only acted in this one, he directed it as well, and of course turned in a superlative performance, as did the old pro Duvall.  I really enjoyed this movie.<p><p>Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books<p></p></body></html>

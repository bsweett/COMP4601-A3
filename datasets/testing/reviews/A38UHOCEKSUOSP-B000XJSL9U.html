<meta name="summary" content="[4.5] Nearly the best Die Hard movie made"></head><body><p>I and maybe a few other fans of the original Die Hard films were probably a bit worried about an addition to the series after all these years (and thank God it was an addition and not a remake which seems to be the Hollywood trend these days).  Die Hard is just impossible to beat, the very first one.  It is arguably the #1 action movie of all time.  Indeed, Live Free or Die Hard can't beat the classic, but I'd have to say it surpasses the others.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is the visuals and the sound.  I was blown away in the theatre, and just as blown away at home.  Visually, the effects are tremendous, accompanying several new and creative action scenes.  The sound is littered with gun fire, hard puches and kicks, and explosions througout the film.  You feel right in the middle of the action.<br /><br />The story is your basic Die Hard terrorist plot, but has been upgraded to the 21st century, focusing on computers and networking.  The terrorists take down networks causing mass panic begining on the eastern seabord.  John McClane once again finds himself in the middle of the action, and protecting a young man who had been targeted for execution after his services had been accomplished.  The lead villain, played by Timothy Olyphant, was as sinister as they come.  I enjoyed his character, but the actor could have been a bit sharper in the role.  His girlfriend, played by Maggie Q, seems to do most of his dirty work, and is skilled in martial arts, giving McClane one heck of an action fight mid-way throught the film.<br /><br />Though the story is intriguing because it ivolves all the high tech stuff this time, the real fun of the movie always comes back to the action - and there is more than plenty throughout the film.  The film begins with some great gun fire scenes - which carry the feel of a video game.  Oddly enough, there are multiple scenes of "Gears of War" on people's computers in the film.  There are some great car chase scenes, especially one where McClane takes out a flying helicopter with a car - huh? - its a must see to believe.  Then there's the finale with McClane in a big rig dodging heavy gunfire from a fighter jet between highway bridges.  Those are just some of the bigger action scenes, the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Overall, this is a must own action pleaser.  CGI has taken over in this Die Hard, but it is used to the fullest.  The characters do their jobs fine, and there is even plenty of humor to keep you laughing in and between all the action.  It is a perfect blend of serious action, fun charcaters, and good humor.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

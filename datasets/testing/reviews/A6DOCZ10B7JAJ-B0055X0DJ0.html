Plus the previews looked pretty spectacular.  But, great special effects hardly compensate for mediocre action sequences and inept storytelling.  This mega-budget clunker has too many moronic nuts and bolts to ever be considered much of a smooth thrill ride.<br /><br />I did like this slightly more than the original, but that's not saying much.  The plot here is pretty stagnant and unimaginative, but I wasn't expecting anything close to THE DARK KNIGHT.  But for some reason this weak story gets stretched to 2.5 hours, and it gets extremely tedious.<br /><br />There are some decent fight scenes, and the Decepticons do seem pretty formidable.  Partially this film seemed geared towards a family film, as there are no human casualties in battle.  But then for some reason they threw in plenty of unneccessary profanity just for some cheap laughs.  And some drug use?  Hardly meant for the younger crowd.<br />Plus some other attempts at humor fall pretty flat.<br /><br />Another Big problem:<br />Shia Lebouf--the dork<br />Megan Fox--the goddess<br />Bumblebee--the awesomest car/robot ever created<br />The result--Lebarf leaves them for college and makes out with the first chick he meets?  Plus Megan catches him and quickly forgives him?<br />Shamefully retarded!!!!!!!<br /><br />Overall, the cool robots, good CGI & music, plus one gorgeous babe can't carry this movie for very long.  It's nearly impossible to fathom how such a big budget action flick could be so painfully boring.</p></body></html>

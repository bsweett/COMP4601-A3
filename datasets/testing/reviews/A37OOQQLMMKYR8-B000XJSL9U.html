A great movie is a great movie regardless of the rating. But the previous 3 Die Hard movies were R-rated and when FOX decided to have the latest Die Hard movie PG-13 I refused to see it. My $10 didn't mean anything; with or without my money the movie would be a hit or flop, but for me it was just the point. The DVD release, which is Unrated is the R-rated cut.<br /><br />It's been 12-years since Die Hard: With a Vengeance and I was a little worried how Live Free or Die Hard would come out, whenever a franchise is resurrected after a long period of time it doesn't always seem to work. Of course there are always gonna be exceptions, but I can't help, but get that feeling of unease. With Live Free or Die Hard I personally found it to be a mixed bag. The biggest problem for me is it feels like every other action movie out there since the Michael Bay era started.<br /><br />Ever action scene has to be bigger and better and storytelling seems to take a backseat to the action sequences and CGI. The first 3 Die Hard movies were very well done. That was back when Hollywood was still able to produce great action movies. At the end of the day the Die Hard movies are mindless fun, but they actually have a plot to go with the action scenes.<br /><br />The screenplay by Mark Bomback was alright, but it lacked the creativity and originality of the previous 3. The script feels like the typical Hollywood blockbuster and the Die Hard movies were more than that. The first half of the movie actually doesn't really feel like Die Hard. It seems like the script was written as another action movie and the executives at FOX decided to make it Die Hard 4. Just change the name of the lead character to John McClane and there you go. The 2nd half though the screenplay improves a bit and starts to feel like a Die Hard movie. But the wisecracks McClane says in my opinion seemed a bit forced, Bruce Willis sells them, but they just seemed a bit forced from a writing stand-point.<br /><br />Director Len Wiseman seems to be hit or miss with the audience, a lot of people say how bad of a filmmaker he is. I have to disagree; filmmaking is more than just storytelling. Obviously, that is the most important part of being a director, but a lot more goes into it. Len Wiseman is the perfect Hollywood filmmaker. He knows how to craft a movie for the mass audience. Live Free or Die Hard might lack in storytelling, but the movie is well made. What he lacks in storytelling skills he makes up for in being able to craft a well made movie.<br /><br />The action scenes are a mixed bag. They don't come out nearly as well as the previous 3 and at times a little too over the top. Now I know you're probably thinking I must be an idiot for saying that since the previous 3 weren't exactly realistic. That is true if you want realism the Die Hard series aren't the movies to watch. But the job of the filmmakers is to make us believe the unbelievable. And to be honest I just couldn't buy into some of the action scenes. They were over the top like the previous 3, but I just couldn't buy into it like I did with the other Die Hard movies.<br /><br />That's not to say the action scenes were bad, by no means were they at all, but I just felt they didn't work as well and maybe a little clich&eacute;d. The action is mostly good and they are fun to watch, but I just feel as if they didn't work nearly as well as they could have.<br /><br />The acting was quite solid and honestly that is what elevates Live Free or Die Hard. Timothy Olyphant makes for a good villain. His performance was solid even if his character was lacking a little bit. And Maggie Q also does a solid job. Her fight scene with McClane was classic. The villains were good, but not as interesting as the previous 3.<br /><br />Mary Elizabeth Winstead was excellent in a small, but vital role. Her character of McClane's daughter Lucy appears early than is MIA until the final act. Originally Britney Spears was a possible choice and Jessica Simpson had an audition. Thankfully neither of them got it. I would have liked to have seen Winstead in a bigger role, but regardless I greatly enjoyed her performance. Cult filmmaker Kevin Smith has a small role and nearly steals the show.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is still giving it his all as John McClane. His performance was excellent and Justin Long steals the show as Matthew Farrell. The reason this movie worked so well was due to Willis and Long. The two really worked well together and give a lot of life to their characters. Willis and Long are a bit clich&eacute;d, even though Justin Long isn't a cop in the movie it does sort have that buddy cop vibe going for it. But the two really do great together.<br /><br />The main reason I'm giving Live Free or Die Hard 4-stars is simple; there are flaws and I personally think it's the weakest of the series. But the movie is entertaining. There is enough action and wisecracks to keep the viewer entertained. Live Free is never boring something is always happening to keep the viewer interested. Even though I feel Len Wiseman may not be the best storyteller out there his scenes do run at a good pace. The pacing never lags and the plot always moves forward. Another reason for the 4-stars is also due to Willis and Long who really do elevate the movie.<br /><br />In closing, while Live Free or Die Hard might lack in overall storytelling compared to the previous 3 and while the action scenes are good they do lack compared to the others, Live Free or Die Hard is still a well made and entertaining movie that moves at a good pace. While as a fan of the series I have to say it was a major letdown, but there is enough going on to keep the viewer entertained.</p></body></html>

As two friends' different philosophies on magic set tensions in motion, it is a tragic death that forever puts a wedge between them. A rivalry ensues between the more penetrating Borden (Bale) and the showman Angiers (Jackman). With three different time lines moving all at once through most of the movie, there's really never a moment's boredom. This storytelling is efficient and compelling. The characters are rich--they really have something to evoke every audience. They have great motive... and that's what the viewers need-- a reason to stay on the journey of the characters. This fact will put you to the edge until the cessation.<br /><br />What I really liked about the film is that it was presented as such a normal, ordinary plot, just like any other movie in a periodic setting. Furthermore, the director presented the theme-envy, obsession, and deceit, in the coolest way to present these things--subtle! This film exposes one of the best "rivalry" stories I have seen for some time. I'd have to give it a thousand claps and hands up! As always, Bale was perfect. Cane was able to really shine as well, especially when reprimanding Angier. A real surprise for me was Hugh Jackman. I was more than worried for his quality of performance in this movie. Thankfully, there was never any reason to be, however. It wasn't till the very end when perhaps he was just a little too over the top (and he kind of earns it) that I thought. Never for a second was I ever tempted to think of Wolverine or elevators.<br /><br />"The Prestige" tells nothing about benevolence. Yes, all of the characters are full of deceit and self-preservation. And yes, the director may have over-sensationalized the theme for some (But I think he presented it as subtle as he could). The thing here is that the decisions made by the director works for the advantage of the film. Why would I feel bad if there is not one character who conveyed a positive disposition? The nature of the characters reflects human nature--and as long as a character does that--it is REAL. We should not be looking for a benign protagonist here--besides, that's getting old. Films that project non contrast between good and evil are marvelous in their own rights. They are laying off the archetypes, the formulaic sense that's been going' on in the film industry for the past 10 years, which should be the case now in the 21st century film-making. At least this movie tried, and as far as I know, succeeds.</p></body></html>

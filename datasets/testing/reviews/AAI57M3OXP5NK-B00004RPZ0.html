<meta name="summary" content="Good."></head><body><p>I like this movie a lot but I liked the other two better because the third Evil Dead doesn't follow the storyline of the other two.  The comedy was good and the acting just as good as always.  The other thing I don't like was the cover on certain editions of Bruce Cambell with muscles, I think this is sending the wrong message to teeenage boys because I have a brother who is 15 and he says he works out to be like these muscle men.  Anyways the movie is good and I recommend it.</p></body></html>

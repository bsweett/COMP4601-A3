(Elk Grove, California) - See all my reviews<br /><br />In my excitement to see the newly released Bourne Ultimatum, I decided to again watch the Bourne Identity, released in 2002. The Bourne Identity features the story by Robert Ludlum with Matt Damon as the amnesia addled Jason Bourne. Directed by Doug Liman (Mr. & Mrs. Smith), this visually pleasing spy thriller boasts excellent fight scenes, chase scenes, and suspense. Matt Damon does an outstanding job as Bourne. Having read the book years ago, I was interested in how well Damon would do as Bourne. He did not disappoint. Having watched the Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy, I can not imagine another actor better suited for the role. Franka Potente, as Marie, does a fine job as the girl who gives Bourne a ride to Paris. Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and Chris Cooper provide excellent acting support. This is a thrilling movie that is incredibly well-done. Matt Damon as an "average guy" thrown into mysterious circumstances really excels here.<br /><br />The movie features stunning shots from a variety of excellent locales throughout Europe. A group of assassins are activated to kill Bourne, and the fun begins. This movie offers two hours of fun filled thrills and suspense. I highly recommend this 5 star movie.</p></body></html>

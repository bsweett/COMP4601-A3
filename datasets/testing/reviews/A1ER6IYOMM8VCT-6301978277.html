<meta name="summary" content="CLASSIC FILM WITH A NICE NEW DVD UPGRADE!"></head><body><p>I bought the new collector's edition of 'Some Like It Hot' a few months ago and I am just getting around to watching it. The film is a classic with Lemmon, Curtis and Monroe in top form with help from a great cast of character actors. This Billy Wilder film has held up really well and now it's got a worthy release. The new 2 disc edition sports a ton of extras and a fantastic print and transfer!</p></body></html>

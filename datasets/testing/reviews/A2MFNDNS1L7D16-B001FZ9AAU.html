<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good comic book adaptation."></head><body><p>It is also updated for our time with events fictionalized from Afganistan, the villans being terrorist, foreign & domestic. Broad enough to spawn endless sequels. Sort of like the James Bond franchise. One problem, however good James Bond is or was, Sean Connery was the best Bond. Vodka martini references aside there are some simularities between  Bond & Robert Downey's Tony Stark (Ironman). He is the best thing about this movie. Let's not forget Gwynth Paltrow as Pepper, his friend assistant & girl everything. She is absolutely fabulous. I can't see either of these gifted actors wasting their careers on too many  Ironmans. It is after all a cartoon.<br />  Tony Stark is a boy genius, smarter than everyone else & heir to a fabulous weapons producing empire. His ego is as big as his fortune but everybody loves him. He manages to get captured while on a visit to Afganistan by terrorist. While in captivity he builds Ironman & long story short, escapes. He returns home a changed man & has a revelation to change the world. He creates another better Ironman to destroy all the weapons of destruction his company has sold to the world. This is not taken well by partners & others that profit from this military industrial complex. At this point the movie just breaks down into foolishness & mayhem. I reccommend this movie. It's good fun</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="mildly inspired by the original, should be called The LA Job . . ."></head><body><p>Borrowing a few key elements, from the original 1969 film, the reworked version of The Italian Job (2003) is a slick, high tech affair that centers on revenge, rather than on executing an outrageously glorious theft, and bolstering national pride.<br /><br />In Venice, Italy, Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) masterminds the theft of a cache of gold bars worth 35 million.  His team includes safecracker John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), driver Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), point man Steve (Edward Norton), and electronics whiz Lyle (Seth Green). The heist goes smoothly, and the mood is celebratory, until Steve pulls a double cross, kills John Bridger, and the crew winds up trapped in an SUV, submerged under the ice of a frozen lake, dodging bullets.<br /><br />Moving forward a year, Croker discovers that Steve has surfaced in LA, going under the name of Steve Frazeli, and gathers his group together, to try and steal back the gold.  Needing a safecracker, he turns to Bridger's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron), who happens to open safes for a living.  The assembled team heads to California, to get the "LA Job" done.<br /><br />Edward Norton has a talent for playing obnoxious characters you love to hate, and the arrogant, sneering Frazeli, is the kind of vermin that deserves to be crushed like a roach.  The man does have a keen instinct for survival, and quickly moves his stash of gold, when he discovers that he is a target.  A swift closer of loose ends, he ruthlessly eliminates the Russian dealer who was exchanging his gold for cash.  With his hand forced, and the Ukrainian mafia poking around, Croker has to quickly adjust his plans, and make a completely different play.<br /><br />The original Italian Job, was about English criminal, who with the backing of the British underworld, makes a play to steal a delivery of gold from the Fiat Company in Turin, Italy.  Remarkably, few connected with the 2003 update, seemed familiar with the 1969 classic.  The newer film is not a remake, or an adaptation, it is more of mutation, grabbing a few selected strands of original DNA material, and adding some high tech elements, purely American sensibilities, and coming out with something completely different.  Prior to being commissioned to do the screenplay, the writers for the update, had also never even seen the original film.  The few key story elements that migrate to the new film include, stolen gold bars, three mini cooper automobiles, looting an armored car, and the manipulation of traffic control systems.<br /><br />With Croker, Bridger and Left Ear, being predominantly behind the wheel, the mini Coopers are prominently featured, on the streets, and in subway tunnels, and the storm drain systems of Los Angeles.  It's a short, but pretty cool ride, with Frazeli following the action from above, in a helicopter.  The ending is PG-13 soft, without the satisfaction of seeing old Steve pounded down like a nail, and the gang finally getting to enjoy their ill gotten gains.  They say it wasn't about the money, but it that just doesn't ring very true.  The film could be much edgier, but things flow so smoothly for the gang, that there is never a feeling of real danger.  And the writing is not as clever as it thinks it is.<br /><br />There is no commentary track, but the bonus featurettes cover the usual making of topics, plus things like the participants lack of familiarity with the original film, the writing of the screenplay, the stunts, and the driving training that the cast went through.  An ultracompetitive Theron, evidently had great enthusiasm for the driving.  Co-writers Donna and Wayne Powers seem extremely pleased with their screenplay, and how it was executed.  That the original film was almost completely gutted, matters not.  Interestingly, no interviews with Edward Norton appear in the featurettes.<br /><br />Although far from a homage to the original film, for what it is, "The LA Job" is a very slick, bold, fast moving, if superficial, action thriller, that mostly entertains.  F. Gary Gray is apparently hands on director, who does have a flair for capturing action.  The acting is not bad for a film of this type, with Wahlberg, Norton, and Theron being quite solid.  Jason Statham, who is capable of much, much more, is an underused team player, and Donald Sutherland's appearance is brief, but impactful.</p></body></html>

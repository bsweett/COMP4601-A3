Very spooky.  Oh, wait, somebody's swiped his wallet.  Apparently a guy was waiting in the closet or something and now he's swiped the dude's wallet.  A person isn't safe.<br />7:37 Ok, I'm about 5 minutes in and I already hate all of the characters.  The main character seems to be a young woman who talks on the cell phone alot.  In other words she is a very unusual young lady.  She tries to look fetching while on the phone, listening with glossy, parted lips and a vacant look in her eyes.  She seems interchangeable with any number of vacuous young women.<br />7:46  Ok, she's just met up with a young "man."  He is irritatingly smarmy from word "go."  He insinuates himself gracelessly into her life, saying, "You'll have a drink if I can guess your drink."  He then goes on to say, "I'm feeling... vodka."  Any young woman who thinks this guy has any substance deserves all she gets.<br />7:52 Ok, these people are all garbage.  Everyone in the movie is a piece of garbage.  Translation: the writer's a piece of garbage.  The "Deputy Director of Homeland Security" is on TV.  He's saying, "Don't get me wrong, I believe diplomacy can work, but first you have to have their attention."  I would imagine directing foreign policy is a little out of the purview of the Deputy Director of Homeland Security.  But I guess we're not supposed to notice.  We're supposed to furrow our brow and say to ourselves, "Political, eh?"  Then we're supposed to feel real sophisticated, ready for the next adult happening in the film.<br />8:05 Ok, the "plane" is taking off and what you see is a computer graphic of a plane instead of a real plane.  They spared no expense on this one.  Over and out.<br />8:52 Ok, post script: the problem with this movie is you don't care about any of the characters.  You don't care if the main character's dad gets killed.  You don't care if the Sub Regulator of Fatherland Purity gets killed.  You just don't care.  In fact, you want them all to die.<br />10:24 Ok, back watching this turkey.  Right now the secret service, which seems to be composed of guys in their mid twenties, is "clearing" the hotel room that the Deputy Inspector of Hometown Integrity and his used-up trophy wife and ridiculously angelic children are about to occupy.  The lead agent, maybe twenty six years old, says, "Clear the room" and next you see a guy in a suit waving a little metal box with knobs and lights on it over a glass vase.  Its unclear what this device is supposed to be detecting... if the room is bugged?  If the vase is made of C4?  You're just supposed to be uncritically letting all this wash over you as you noisily slurp from your giant soda and think about pretending to stretch and then letting your arm fall on the shoulder of your date.  You're not supposed to be wondering how exactly this activity you are witnessing constitutes "clearing the room." THEN one of the other agents looks from the penthouse balcony over the ocean through binoculars and sees a lone yacht about a mile away.  He calls this to the attention of the lead agent who says, "Call it in."  I see.  So the vicinity of the hotel is now restricted air land and sea space?  Like if there's a fat guy about to go off the diving board... "Call him in."  I'm REALLY rooting for the assassins at this point.<br />11:06 Ok, done.  Very depressed.  Movie absolutely ludicrous.  Night shot to hell.  IT seems as though the film-makers are counting on the viewer hoping Dad doesn't get killed and the Vice Secretary of Homeland Infiltration doesn't get assassinated because.... we cherish human life?  It is taken for granted that we think the dude is right as rain, and ditto for dear old dad who seems to do nothing other than sleep in his chair.<br />1:00 PM, next day: Lemme see if I got this right: the fiendishly clever plan is as follows: waylay a girl who works behind the desk in a hotel, threaten her with her father being killed if she doesn't move the target to a different room, then some guys in a boat retrieve a bazooka from the ocean floor with a fishing pole and blow the room sky high, all for the purpose of offing this "politico"?  This plan really stinks.  Ever hear of the KISS principle?  All you need is one guy with a sniper rifle.  He puts a bullet through this A-hole's head and... pack your bags fellas, war's over.  What's that you say?  These "secret service" guys are muy professional and they'll totally detect los sniper?  That's nonsense.  Just think of the number of locations our man could be in, the hundreds of office buildings, etc etc.  Besides, if that's not dramatic enough for the Hollywood fast set who know so much about warfare, why don't our assassins just show up in a helicopter armed with miniguns and process the dude to the tune of 4,000 7.62mm rounds a minute?  That's good viewing.  I'd pay double admission just to watch 10 minutes of slo-mo of the dude getting hosed down.  In fact, I will personally volunteer to direct the mission to kill this fictional character.  Just give me a minigun-equipped little bird and I will be inbound hot.  To paraphrase Tennyson, The dude will be at the quiet limit of the world... and the joyless end of the minigun.  Or how bout they just take out the motorcade with some LARS rockets?  What's that you say?  The motorcade is composed of "armored Escalades??!?"  Ohhh, I'm scared.  You think the screenwriter would like to take a direct bazooka hit while sitting in an "armored Escalade"?</p></body></html>

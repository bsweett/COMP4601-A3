I didn't care one iota about ANY of the characters and I completely HATED how the Predator toward the end shows something resembling benevolence, completely removing his aura of mercilessness. Like the people in it, I can hardly remember what the story was about. It was obviously weak. I will say the fight between the two has its moments but it doesn't come close to epic status befitting these two legendary creatures. The final seconds are okay, I guess, but it's nothing more than a cliched tease for a possible sequel (at least that's what the producers must be clamoring for). Ultimately it is a failure because I totally forgot about it soon after watching it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CALL ORKIN!"></head><body><p>In this claustrophobic tale set in a low rent motel in nowheresville, Ashley Judd's character meets a whacked-out Gulf War vet.  The latter is convinced that the government has implanted insects into his skin.  The story unfolds with deepening levels of paranoia within the walls of the seedy motel until a self-immolating climax at the end.<br /><br />I guess the multiple cans of Raid and flypaper strips didn't work.<br /><br />The pacing is glacial.  The plot is thin and unconvincing.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great movie!<br /><br />This stinkeroo needs a can of Glade air freshener to dispel the stench.</p></body></html>

Fortunately, director Steven Spielberg doesn't let this happen, and instead lets the plot play out to its fullest.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Jurassic Park" sees billionaire mogul John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) build an amusement park housing eight species of dinosaurs.  However, in order to get the corporate "O.K" on the whole project, Hammond calls in two scientists Alan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to put the place through a fine-tooth comb from a biological perspective.  However, largely due to some corporate intrigue, the park is completely shut down during the tour, leaving all the electric fences unwired and setting up a struggle between species that were never meant to interact.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is an action/adventure flick filled with impressive images, and in that role it succeeds admirably.  The 1993 graphics still measure up to anything that has been produced today, and almost all of the action sequences are breathtaking and will have you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />What really gives "Jurassic Park" a solid four stars, though, is that Spielberg doesn't "take sides".  Equally screen time is given to both perspectives: educational and biological.  The viewer is allowed to see the pros and cons of both, and weigh them themselves in advance of the sequel.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid film that delivers in all important departments: effects, action, plot, and characters.  Plus, thanks to the Spielberg direction, it holds up very well almost 20 years later.</p></body></html>

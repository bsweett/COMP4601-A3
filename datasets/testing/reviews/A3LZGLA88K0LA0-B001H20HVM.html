<meta name="summary" content="PLAY BY THE RULES"></head><body><p>Visceral.  Sadistic.  Incredible.  Effectively horrifying.  These all apply to this bloody remake to the popular SAW.  Only Shawnee Smith as Amanda, Tobin Bell as Jigsaw and Dina Meyer as the detective return from the original, but the bloodletting continues and the game seems to have the same rules.  Perhaps another actor than Donnie Wahlberg would have been more convincing, but even he manages to pull his role off.  The premise of the eight people being held hostage in an abandoned house, all doomed to die unless they succeed in playing Jigsaw's game, is nothing new; it all started similarly with TEN LITTLE INDIANS and has continued on since.<br /><br />The movie has its shocking moments, some scenes almost too painful to really watch.  The acting is effective, but no real standouts.  Franky G is playing the same role he always plays and Glenn Plummer does his requisite bad boyz persona.  Bell is lethally chilling as Jigsaw, and since we know SAW III is coming out later this year, you won't be too surprised at the ending.</p></body></html>

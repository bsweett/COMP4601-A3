The mission included Raymond Shaw, a man whom Marco recommended for the Medal of Honor, and who is now running for Vice-President of the United States.  Shaw is constantly manipulated by his mother, played with conniving perfection by Meryl Streep.  Soon Marco begins to discover that there is some truth to his dreams and he realizes that he and Shaw, along with their whole unit, were programmed to act as they did.  There is some overkill in the plot and the intensity of the characters, but all in all this is a riveting movie which keeps the viewer guessing until all is revealed at the end.</p></body></html>

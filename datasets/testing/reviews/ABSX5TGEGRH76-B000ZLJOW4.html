<meta name="summary" content="When Unpopular Sarcastic Girls Attack"></head><body><p>Ghost World is a very comical, very dark look at American society through the eyes of two teenage misfits.  Recent high school graduates Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two girls who are outsiders, and that's how they like it.  They can't stand America's obsession with pop-culture, non-conformism, and retro styles.  They try to seperate themselves any way that they can.  They like to play cruel pranks on people they don't like or tell people awful things, true or false.  They hassle a boy (Brad Renfro) who works at a convenience store, they make fun of the valedictorian (Rini Bell), who is in a wheel chair and neck brace due to an accident involving alcohol, and they show up at Wowsville, a 50's nostalgia cafe that plays rap and techno music, just so they can mock the establishment to the waiters.  Neither of them are virgins, but I think that they were only messing with the guys that had sex with them (it's never directly stated, but I came to that conclusion myself, especially since their personalities would drive most guys away).  While most of the people/things that they attack deserve criticim (the valedictorian states in her speech that she no longer needs drugs, she is later seen drinking from a flask, and Wowsville is a poor excuse for a 50's diner), they still focus their time and energy on these things.  They even buy food at Wowsville, thus supporting the very thing they make fun of.  It seems as if even they can't seem to completely detatch themselves from the things they claim to hate so much.<br /><br />Neither of them plan on going to college, probably because it's what "everyone" is doing.  Instead, they try to find jobs so that they can move in together.  However, while Rebecca gets a job at a coffee shop (not Starbucks, but the same kind of place) and begins to grow up out of her high school persona, Enid is unable to either hold a job or outgrow her old, sarcastic self (which is part of the reason she can't hold onto a job).  She is perfectly happy going through life, criticizing the people and things she finds to be stupid (which is nearly everyone and everything).  Then she meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a middle-aged record collector who turns out to be a target of one of her pranks.  Even though she looks down on him, thinking he's a loser, she can't help but become somewhat attracted to him, both mentally and physically.  As she later states, "He's the opposite of everything I hate".<br /><br />Ghost World follows Enid, Rebecca, and Seymour over the course of the summer following their graduation.  Enid must attend a summer school art class (she failed during the year, and probably because even though she is a great artist, she doesn't conform to the teacher's nonconformist ways, if that makes sense).  Rebecca searches for apartments, while Enid shoots down her every suggestion, and the two best friends begin to pull apart.  Enid also spends a lot of time with Seymour, trying to get him to go on dates, but secretly hoping that he will ask her out.<br /><br />Not everyone will understand this movie.  Some people who do may find it to be too dark, or depressing, or pessimistic.  Personally, I found it to be hilarious and somewhat poignant, which is strange, seeing as how I am probably a likely target for one of their pranks.</p></body></html>

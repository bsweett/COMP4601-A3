<meta name="summary" content="KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND YOU'LL ENJOY THIS FILM! 4 STARS!"></head><body><p>When I saw the trailer for this film a year ago, my heart sank! It looked like as disaster about to unfold right in front of me. I mean Seth Rogen! as the Green Hornet?!!! I didn't even run to rent this, but found myself with a free rental and nothing else looked interesting that I hadn't seen yet.<br /><br />To my surprise this film was very funny and even though purist will cringe at the liberties taken with the original story, this film is a refreshing goof on superhero films. First off, we have a hero who is delusional and so inept, that his "sidekick" is really the driving force behind all his power and intelligence. Kato played by scene chewing Jay Chou is the perfect balance for Rogen's flippant style and the two make for a very unconventional team, with a refreshing rapport that I haven't seen in these types of films before.<br /><br />I gave this film 5 stars because I think there are way too many 1 star reviews for this misunderstood action movie and maybe with a little push this film will be recognized for its witty and undeniable original take on the super hero movie. 4 stars for a jolly good time and making me eat my words!</p></body></html>

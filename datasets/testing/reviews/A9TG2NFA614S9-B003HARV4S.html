<meta name="summary" content="Magic Tricks Work for Norton"></head><body><p>"The Illusionist" is an absorbing, well-acted film that is part love story, part mystery, and all engrossing. Edward Norton is the magician who seems to possess supernatural powers. As a kid from the wrong side of the tracks he falls for a patrician girl, Duchess Sophia and thus begins the story.<br /> New York Times film critic A.O. Scott (10/24/08) reviewing the cop movie "Pride and Glory" said it "brings out the full measure of Mr. Norton's vanity, by far his least appealing attribute." In this film Norton plays a charismatic illusionist so one does expect a little more egotism and vanity than one would get, in say a cop.<br />Paul Giamatti is superb as the police inspector under the thumb of Crown Prince Leopold, the magician's rival for the love of Sophia. The setting is 1900 Vienna with the Austro-Hungarian Empire in full swing. The illusionist develops a cult following among the people which irks the Crown Prince. Norton's cold, detached attitude and the sense of dread and menace he kindles make the movie a pleasure to watch. The mystery near the end turns it into a fascinating detective story. The photography is outstanding and stunningly imaginative.</p></body></html>

I wanted something over the top and fast paced.  Instead, "Kick-Ass," while certainly over the top, is not fast paced at all.  Rather, it is two completely different movies shoehorned into one, that are only tied together at the very end.  The first movie is the story of a schlubby teen who becomes Kick-Ass out of a love of comic books and sense of idealism.  The second movie is the story of Big Daddy and his daughter Hit Girl, who are far more successful superheroes.  Oddly, the story of Kick-Ass is less serious than the story of Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  "Kick-Ass" suffers from jarring tonal shifts as well as a very slow moving first act.  If you can wade through the first 20-30 minutes, the better stuff kicks in.<br /><br />However, at 2 hours this movie was too long for its own good.  The length is attributable to the fact that there are two different jammed-together stories to tell.  Paradoxically, even with the 2-hour length, the narrative seems thin and not fully fleshed out.<br /><br />Hit Girl is awesome, and is without a doubt the best part of this movie.  I would have preferred that the movie be called "Hit Girl" and that it was 90 minutes with her.  That's one sequel I can enthusiastically await!<br /><br />"Kick Ass" is at least worth a rent, but I doubt you will want to own this unless you are a comic book movie completist.</p></body></html>

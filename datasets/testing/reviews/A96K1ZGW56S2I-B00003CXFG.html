It is obvious that the film didn't entail a huge budget (there probably would have been at least one familiar name in the cast if there had been). But some of the best films of all time are the ones that didn't have much of a budget (e.g. Rocky). PITCH BLACK isn't a great sci-fi movie, but it is better than most.<p>The story was quite believable and does not deny it's homage to the classic ALIEN. The acting is wonderful and the cinematography and brilliant lighting (or lack of) that conceals the film's small budget (yet fits wonderfully with the plot) is pure genius. The movie kept me both in suspense and full of interest. PITCH BLACK is one of the most underrated movies of 2000. Like the characters in the film, perhaps the movie can finally find a way out of the shadows and make its way into the light of respect.</p></body></html>

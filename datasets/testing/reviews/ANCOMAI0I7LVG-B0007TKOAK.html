In `Sideways' Paul Giamatti is so on point, so in tune with Miles that he becomes one of the most relatable and likable characters of that given year.  We travel with Miles not only through the countryside but through life itself and see his values, his fears, his wants and desires.  We understand him as a person and that's very important for the effectiveness of the film.  Thomas Haden Church's character is far from sympathetic and so it rest firmly on Giamatti's shoulders to keep the viewer caring for the film and the people within.  He does so with warmth and depth.<br /><br />The film follows friends Miles and Jack as they travel the California countryside for a wine tasting extravaganza before Jack gets married the next weekend.  It's supposed to be a vacation filled with wine, golf and male bonding, but thanks to Jack's weak will power Miles ends up spending most his time alone while Jack is out pursuing the attention of single mother Stephanie.  When Miles isn't commiserating over his failed marriage he's slowly but surely forming a bond with Maya, a sweet and gentle bartender who's been on Miles mind for some time.  As their vacation comes to an end and the wedding gets closer Jack must decide how to end his relationship with Stephanie without telling her too much and Miles must find a way to salvage all that's good with his relationship with Maya in the wake of the storm.<br /><br />Thomas Haden Church, while playing a character that even I couldn't justify, does so with such dire devotion that you can't help but appreciate him.  He's splendid here and well deserved the Oscar nomination.  Virginia Madsen is so luminous as Maya, I just can't help but fall in love with her.  When I first saw the film I couldn't quite understand how she received the Oscar nomination, but after repeated viewings I was able to see the brilliance in her subtlety.  She was fantastic.  Sandra Oh is unfairly ignored when it comes to praising the actors in this film.  She may not be in very many scenes, but her character is fleshed out well for her lack of major screen time.  But in the end this film begins and ends with Paul Giamatti who is just a revelation here.  He's so extraordinary as Miles that his snub for even a nomination is so disgusting to me.  And for who, Clint Eastwood?  He was already going to win the directing Oscar; did he really need an acting nomination?<br /><br />The film does a wonderful job of showing the strength of true friendship.  Alexander Payne adapted this screenplay brilliantly and directs it with effortless passion and compassion.  I couldn't help but rationalize with Miles mainly because I've had friends like Jack who don't seem to show too much care or concern for your general feelings but in the end you know they love you.  Miles and Jack are so close they cross the line of family and once that happens your friends get away with treating you worse then you'd normally put up with.  We all have our friends we let walk all over us, not because we're weak or spineless but because losing them would be worse than putting up with their quarks.  In the end Jack is a lucky man to have a friend as devoted and forgiving as Miles.<br /><br />I will mention that, although I rant and rave about this film and truly believe it should have walked away with top honors at the Oscars (especially of the five films nominated) I must admit to being the only person in my family to feel that way.  My wife likes this film, but it's nothing she'd rush to watch a second time (I on the other hand have seen it numerous times) and my parents and siblings found it rather boring.  It all depends on your type of film or your type of humor.  I know this is registered as a comedy, but to me it's more of a drama with some funny scenes.  It's very sad in parts, frustrating in others, dramatic and touching and then, yes, funny.  Miles tantrum where he drinks the wine out of the spit bucket is probably my favorite single scene in the film for it perfectly fuses the dramatic tension and sense of total frustration with pure comedy.  Just know that this may not be your cup of tea, but give it a try before you cast judgment.</p></body></html>

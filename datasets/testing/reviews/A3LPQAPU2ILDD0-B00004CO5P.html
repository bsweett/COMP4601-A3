<meta name="summary" content="INSPIRATIONAL MASTERPIECE"></head><body><p>Flawless movie making at its best! Patriotic and powerful telling of the true beginning-of-the-end for the Confederacy. Ex-slaves and free blacks alike, finally allowed to defend their dignity, were the final blow to the Southern bondage of an entire race of human beings history tells us. The Truth based story of the Massachusetts 54th. Only the beginning of black heroics during the Civil War.<br /><br />From the dignified talent of Morgan Freeman, to Denzel Washington's Academy Award winning performance as a militant loud mouth runaway, great acting to suit everything else about this film. And another level of respect achieved for Matthew Broderick indeed. So many standout scenes, but most memorable, Denzel's beating. Back already scarred from his cruelly treated past, he takes his punishment in total silence. Only allowing a single tear to fall during a cinematic closeup. Heartbreaking.<br /><br />The highest rating possible.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ANOTHER PIXAR GRANDSLAM"></head><body><p>Pixar doesn't seem capable of falling into the cute-zone that Disney ( and, yes, I do realize Pixar is partnered with Disney... ), and a good many other studios that produce animation movies do, and as with WALL-E, TOY STORY 3 strikes no false notes. I was almost wishing for my childhood again, after seeing this eye-popping pic ( it might be a bit scary for 5-year olds, however ), and it's not just because of the amazing voices behind the iconic characters, or the incredible animation, but the story is way beyond the merely adequate. TOY STORY 3 simply has great humor, wonderful characters, and an amazing amount of heart. I rate it 'G' for genius.</p></body></html>

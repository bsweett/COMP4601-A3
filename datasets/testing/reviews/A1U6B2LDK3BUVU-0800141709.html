The only good thing about it is that it warns us against right wing lunatics who might start a nuclear war because they are crazy.  Fine.  It is politically correct.  But that doesn't mean that the movie is any good, and it isn't.  I have hated almost every Stanley Kubrick film I have ever seen.  His work is terrible.  The best of the sorry lot is Barry Lyndon, which is too long, too slow paced, has no characters who aren't annoying and despicable, but is worth three stars, which is more than I can say for the rest of his garbage.</p></body></html>

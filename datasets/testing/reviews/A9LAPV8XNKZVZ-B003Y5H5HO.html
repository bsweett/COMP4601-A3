Next day went to a different theater and had a chance to really see it. Rooney brings a vulnerability to the role that's new. Not a frame is wasted. Info in each. Masterfully edited. A real enjoyable experience. This crew would really deliver an amazing "Fire"<br /><br />Courses could be taught plumbing the themes and issues raised in the script and direction:<br />Time- is central to the mystery and is elastic here, slowing, speeding up, deceiving the audience.<br />Fathers and daughters- From the real to the perverted, the wished for and rejected.<br />Touch- the varieties of human contact. Who touches who, who moves away.<br />Sound- trains, floor buffers, the wind, leather on metal.<br />Mothers- where are they?<br />Appearances- we look but do not see what is reality.<br />News- Pay attention to the media, the scroll beneath the news reader, the info flashed on the screen, the headlines. The coffee shop.<br />Greetings- hey,hey or lack thereof.<br /><br />Even if you have read the books and seen the other movies, bring your brain, you will be rewarded. Brilliant.</p></body></html>

My wife said it reminded her of "The War of the Roses" with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, which I enjoyed.  Other than the very basic premise of hubby and wife trying to kill each other, I couldn't see much in common between that clever and entertaining film and this very predictable star and firepower vehicle.  Maybe it was intended as a date movie for dual markets--big guns for the guys and tabloid stars for the girls.  It's appeal escaped me.</p></body></html>

This movie,  which frankly speaking didnt do remarkably well at the box office because it came out at the same time as E.T. but did do well as a home movie is,  in a word,  terrifying.  Its set at an arctic research base where a cast of characters including Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley stumble upon an alien life form and the results are gory and jarring.  The subtle mood music is the icing on the cake....terrific horror stuff.<br /><br />  So if youre a fan of horror movies,  John Carpenter movies,<br /><br />then go get this one.  Its a classic</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hey Stinky!!!!"></head><body><p>I liked this movie. I never read the graphic novels or anything so I didn't know the story but when I first saw the trailer I thought... this looks cool. I wasn't wrong. I thought Ron Pearlman was perfect as Big Red and the cast was really good. Even Selma Blair who I think is a weak actress was good. John Hurt was excellent as usual.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes it was a bit weak in some spots but it was fun. I liked the whole premise of Hellboy. The Rasputin stuff was good and the villians were excellent. I just wish they would have concentrated more on the Nazi villians (Rasputin, his female stooge and the Nazi guy with the blades... he was cool). They kind of had too much of Hellboy battling the 'hounds of hell' thing too much. But it was still entertaining and fun and had a lot of good puns and humor. I liked the triangle between Hellboy, Liz and the young FBI guy.<br /><br />Fun flick and worth buying.</p></body></html>

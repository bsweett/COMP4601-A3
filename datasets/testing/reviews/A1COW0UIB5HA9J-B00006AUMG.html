<meta name="summary" content="Superb sequel and a great 2-Disc Edition!"></head><body><p>The daywalker known as "Blade" ( Wesley Snipes) is back! but this time, there is a race of powerful vampire creatures known only as "Reapers", they are parasitic genetically enhanced vampiric beings that suck the blood of both humans and vampires alike as they are bent on draining the lives of both races. A new order vampire clan joins up with Blade and Whistler ( Kris Kristofferson)as they both must be with the clan to exterminate these new breed bloodsuckers.<br /><br />An electrifying and ultraviolent sequel to the 1998 hit based on Marvel Comics vampire flick that reunites Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson with of course a new cast most reconigizably Ron Perlman from Hellboy and City of Lost Children as one of the vampire warriors. Director Guillermo Del Toro's style for this movie is just impressive as it triumphs over the original in anyway with more action, more vampires ( but some different ones this time), more gore, better acting and fantastic martial arts sequences that are cherographed nicely.<br /><br />The 2-Disc DVD has great stuff like crisp picture & Sound, two audio commentaries, isolated scroe, Deleted/Alternate scenes with commentary, galleries, documentaries, music video, trailer, and DVD Rom content. This is a must have DVD for the fanatics of horror movies, action, comic book movies, and vampire flicks alike, you won't regret it.</p></body></html>

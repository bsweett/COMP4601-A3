On the one hand I had `The Incredibles' in memory, one of the finest cartoons ever made.  On the other I had `Cars' still in recent memory, one of the most overrated, over hyped pieces of cartoon garbage I had the horror of having to sit through.  Thankfully `Ratatouille' leans towards `The Incredibles', delivering one of the most refreshing and entertaining cartoon experiences in recent memory.  Cartoon's as of late have been on the dull side, none really jumping out and saying "I am the next classic, I am the movie your children and your children's children will love forever", until now.  Now, this isn't to say that `Ratatouille' is perfect, because in my opinion `The Incredibles' is a better all around film, but `Ratatouille' is the finest film to be released in cartoon form since it's glorious predecessor (I know, I really need to see `Persepolis', and I will eventually).<br /><br />`Ratatouille' revolves around Remy, a young rat who, unlike the rest of his pack, really cherishes food.  Sure, his fellow rats love to eat, but they'll eat anything.  Remy only wants the best food he can attain.  He's picky.  Living in France Remy has become fascinated with the famed chef Auguste Gusteau and is brokenhearted to hear that he has died suddenly upon receiving a scathing review by food critic Anton Ego.  Auguste firmly believed that anyone could cook and even wrote a book to that effect, a book that Remy would sneak out to read.  When an unfortunate event separates Remy from his family he finds himself in Paris with the most desirable of opportunities at his paws.<br /><br />Remy finds the late Gusteau's restaurant, now run by his sous-chef Skinner, a man who is as intolerable as he is feisty.  He is soon propositioned by a young garbage boy, Linguini, who, thanks to Remy, has been mistaken for a chef with talent and been promoted to the important position.  With Remy's talent and Linguini's human looks they pass off as the best chef Paris has ever seen, but a secret that Skinner is privy to leads him to work his hardest to thwart Linguini's progress.<br /><br />`Ratatouille' does a brilliant job of not only delivering state of the art animation (the movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at) but delivering a warm and touching story that gives real heart to these characters.  Remy's love for food, his passion and his determination to be himself despite the disapproval of those closest to him (namely his father) is admirable and teaches us the importance of fighting for what we believe in, for what we know is our destiny.  It also reigns forward with lessons on loyalty and humility, of honesty and compassion.  It teaches children and adults alike that these are admirable and commendable traits we all should strive to achieve.<br /><br />The voice talents enlisted here are superb, Patton Oswald delivering magnificently as Remy and Peter O'Toole truly stealing the show as the feared critic Anton Ego.<br /><br />With it's keen eye to detail, both in imagery and in story, `Ratatouille' proves itself deserving of all the praise that has been heaped upon it's sturdy shoulders and manages to be one of the only cartoons in recent years to be worthy of the Animated Feature Oscar.  Let's just say that if `Ratatouille' loses this year it'll be a crying shame, to know that the mediocre at best `Happy Feet' has an Oscar and this magical adventure does not.  Well, I have a feeling that this little rat will run full force to the podium this year to accept his very well deserved prize.</p></body></html>

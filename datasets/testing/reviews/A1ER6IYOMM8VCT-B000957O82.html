<meta name="summary" content="KEVIN JAMES STEALS THE SHOW!"></head><body><p>One of the better romantic comedies I've seen in a while. I was very happy to see Kevin James in this film. He really steals the show considering the screen time devoted to him. The relationship between Kevin's character and the upscale object of his affection is very believable. I would have liked to have seen more of the two of them in this picture. Will Smith is very good as usual and his story adds a good contrast to the people he helps win their dreams girls. All in all it is a funny lighthearted film that I enjoyed. The DVD transfer is very good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="First there was Batman, then Spider-Man, and now the Incredibles!"></head><body><p>"The Incredibles" is a movie that adults will enjoy as much as kids. Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) was a famous superhero until a bunch of people started filing lawsuits against the superheroes who saved them. Together with his wife, the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Mr. Incredible enters a sort of superhero witness protection program. The couple assume new identities, Bob and Helen Parr, and raise their three children (two of whom also have superpower tendencies) in anonymity for the next 15 years. Bob is miserable in his job as an insurance claims specialist, so when a mysterious informant offers him the chance to play hero again, he jumps at the opportunity. Unfortunately, the whole thing turns out to be a trap that was orchestrated by a superhero wannabe that Mr. Incredible angered many years ago. Mr. Incredible/Bob soon finds himself in the middle of a very sticky situation, and his wife and children have to return to their superhero roots in order to save the day.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this movie. It's very funny and original, and all of the characters are fantastic. In addition to the Incredibles, there's Bob's best friend Lucius Best, the former superhero Frozone, who is voiced by Samuel L. Jackson. ("Woman, where is my super suit?!") My favorite character is a quirky little woman with big glasses named Edna Mode who designs superhero outfits. Every word out of her mouth is HILARIOUS! ("Yes, words are useless! Gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble-gobble!")<br /><br />This film has a PG rating. Unlike most animated films, there's a lot of shooting and people dying in "The Incredibles." I don't think it's excessive at all and it's certainly tamer than most of the stuff kids watch on television these days, but some overly-sensitive parents might have a problem with it.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this movie. It was much better than I thought it would be because it's not a typical animated film...in some respects, I think adults will actually get much more out of it than kids. "The Incredibles" is a fun movie that also stresses the importance of family and teamwork. Parents will enjoy watching this movie with their kids and adults who don't have kids will enjoy it, too!</p></body></html>

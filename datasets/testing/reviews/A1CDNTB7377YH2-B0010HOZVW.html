Jodie Foster is a radio personality who is about to be married.  Her fiance is murdered by some hoodlums and Foster left for dead.  When she recovers in the hospital she seems to be possessed by a dark force seeking out revenge against all violent evil-doers.  Some scenes are similar to Death Wish and Bernard Goetz.  And like Charles Bronson in Death Wish she is being persued by New York Detective.  At first he doesn't suspect Foster but she seems to be at the scene of some of the crimes, using her radio personna as a cover.  He seems to be the opposite of Foster as he is usually powerless to act against evil-doers because the law ties his hands while Foster just blows the evil-doers away without a qualm.</p></body></html>

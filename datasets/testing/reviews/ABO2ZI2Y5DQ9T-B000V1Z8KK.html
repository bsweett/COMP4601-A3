<meta name="summary" content="Highly Implausible, Still Engaging Non-Stop Action Thriller"></head><body><p>For a thriller fan like me, "Shooter" looks like a modernized, post 9/11 version of "Three Days of Condor," made about 30 years ago. The difference is that "Shooter" is not about bookish Robert Redford; it is about Bob Lee Swagger played by Mark Wahlberg, retired ace sniper living quietly with his dog. One day Bob is visited by three men in black suit (including Danny Glover) who coax him into another mission, that is, to prevent a rumored plot of assassinating the president of the United States.<br /><br />Anyone who knows some basics of thriller would soon know what follows after that. Of course Bob shouldn't have left his mountain cabin. He is in for big trouble, of which nature should not be disclosed here ... well, but you may have already known that). To survive, Bob enlists help from Nick Memphis, disgraced FBI agent (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and Sarah Fenn, ex-love of his former partner (Kate Mara), with "enemies" at his heels.<br /><br />The film's script begins with an intriguing premise that would remind us of "JFK," but it gradually becomes clear that though slick and engaging, "Shooter" does not offer anything new much. Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day" "King Arthur") manages to keep the ball rolling, and he knows how to set up the right mood for each moment of the story with a blend of snappy actions including car chases and shootings, and the beautifully-shot photography.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg who keeps playing touch guy roles these days, and Michael Pe&ntilde;a are both very good though even their fine acting cannot make us forget the fact that the script has so many plot holes and implausible events. Kate Mara and Rhona Mitra appear, but their characters are there to further the story; once it is done, they are forgotten until the next occasion.<br /><br />"Shooter" is a roller coaster of actions with one stoic, invincible hero in center and a bunch of villains waiting to be his next target. It is not a classic, but still entertaining with the director's inspired visual sense and a string of decent actions.</p></body></html>

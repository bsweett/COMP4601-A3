Santa had a softspot for babies, so Buddy (named after his diaper brand)  was given to an Elf (bob newhart) to raise.  Well, as buddy grew up, he was noticably different. After a series of disasterous attempted jobs at the north pole, the secret leaked out that buddy was a human.  So papa elf share with buddy the secret of his origin. It was at that point Buddy decided to go on a mission in search of his human father (mother unfortunately passed away), played by james caan.  We then follow Buddy to new york city at christmas time, in search of his day. Well from here, the story takes of, the adaptation of an Elf in the human world, let alone at christmas time.  Let's just say he was suprised at "SANTA" when he showed up at the department store.  The movie is funny, and fresh, with moments of drama and sadness, but overall wrapped in a happy, funny story that ends well for all.  A great holiday movie, check it out.</p></body></html>

I'm no church historian myself, but I have no argument with the people who claim Dan Brown has misrepresented Christian history.  I also have no quarrel with Brown for playing fast and loose with the facts in the hopes of writing a more provocative and exciting story.  I think Christians can relax; after 2,000 years, including some times of truly horrendous persecution, I think the Christain faith will survive the New York Times bestsellers list.<br /><br />My problem with "Da Vinci Code" is that it is so boring.  I couldn't work up much interest in the constant conspiracy theorizing--it was like watching nine seasons of the "X-Files," without the good parts, condensed into two hours.  We have a few minutes of breathless exposition in one scenic location, jump into a car and race to another location for some more exposition, board a plane and fly somewhere else for still more exposition, and so on.  Director Ron Howard's attempts to liven things up with special effects imaginings of the events described don't quite do the job.</p></body></html>

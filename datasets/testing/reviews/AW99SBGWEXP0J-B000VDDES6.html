<meta name="summary" content="Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell's star is on the rise. With hits like &quot;Elf&quot;, &quot;Old School&quot;, and now &quot;Anchorman&quot; under his belt he seems to have made a life for himself beyond &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, the number one news anchor in San Diego in the 1970s, who is somewhat of a living legend in the area. He is the face that everyone looks to for the news. Enter Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), a woman with high aspitations, and a determination that set off a war between herself and Burgundy. She wasnt to be an anchor, and he does not see how a woman can do what he does. When fate steps in, and Bergundy finds himself late for a broadcast, he finds his world turned upside down as Corningstone fills in for him...and does well.<br /><br /> &quot;Anchorman&quot; is a very satirical look at the news world of the 1970s as women are trying to break into a man's game. Will Ferrell disappears into Ron Burgundy, and carries the movie completely. The supporting case (along with a few surprise cameos) lend their own quirkyness to the supporting characters. If the previews looked funny to you, you will enjoy this movie. There are plenty more laughs to be found...and be sure to stay through the credits!</p></body></html>

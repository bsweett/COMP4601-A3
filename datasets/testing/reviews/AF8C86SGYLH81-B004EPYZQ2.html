Abrams and Producer Steven Spielberg, captures everything about the dreams of my youth.  I remember writing creative stories for my grade school class and illustrating them with crayon drawings.  I was hooked on Science Fiction like many young men of that era.  "Super 8" is a masterpiece...not only because it ventures where my thoughts and creative dreams wandered, but because it was perfectly cast, scripted and visualized by Spielberg and Abrams.  Without giving away one cent of the plot and outcome, this is a film that unfolds to new heights and you find yourself taking tiny doses of what ends up to be a mighty prescription for thrills, chills and heart-tugging (a trademark of Spielberg) emotions.  When it comes to an end, you'll want to watch it again.  When it begins, you never really want it to end.  Don't miss this gem.</p></body></html>

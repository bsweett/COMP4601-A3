<meta name="summary" content="Class from Carpenter"></head><body><p>I saw this at the Cinema in 1982 and on occasions had to watch through my fingers!<br /><br />This film and Aliens were the last two great Sci-fi/horror films that did not have digital special effects. The effects in this film are astounding. For the younger people reading this (those born after the late 60's) you have to realise that what you see on the screen was actually created in the studio and not on a computer. They still look good compared with todays CGI and remain the pinnacle of animatronic special effects. Full credit to Rob Bottin the special effects wizard on The Thing.<br /><br />The film itself is a claustraphobic affair once The Thing is loose in the camp, and you continally have doubts about which character is still human. The suspense is helped immensely by a intense music soundtrack by Ennio Morricone, who had obviously listened to some of Carpenters own soundtrack music.<br /><br />Kurt Russell in the leading role does a great job as MacReady, and the supporting cast which includes Keith David (Platoon, Pitch Black) and Richard Dysart all give good performances.<br /><br />This film was a high point for John Carpenters career, since whilst he has made some good films since (They Live for example) most of them have been very poor in comparison compared with this film.<br /><br />The DVD has digital 5.1 sound.</p></body></html>

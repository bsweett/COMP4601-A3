<meta name="summary" content="i'm the demographic , that's getting rare"></head><body><p>this film is not without flaw . it gets so much so right though , it's not even about the fight . we all know the ROCKY films have not been RAGING BULL from the get go . the first film was a tremendously uplifting story about the spirit of an individual brawler who never would have prevailed giving and getting such superhuman punishment . if MR. TARVER'S character were to actually box MR. STALLONE'S character , it would last moments . it wouldn't even happen in exhibition . it's a mistake to observe this film as if it were an approximation of CINDERELLA MAN . you forgive the deep dark dye job if you understand that this film is about maturity . between the first film and this picture there were a lot of fun movies that were guilty pleasures more often than not . fun to watch over and over because of their implausibe and rote formula of good verses bad or proud or unfair . this rousing picture serves as a proper bookend to the first great chapter in a character saga . one in which we don't have to see the central character aged by make up but rather actual time itself . STALLONE'S maturity informs an individual so right and real that the only significant flaw is that he manages to go several rounds with the young boxer . by surrounding himself with an outstanding group of actors young and old . by putting so much truth into the lions share of what occurs on screen (in word and deed) . i feel he made the finest ROCKY picture yet . after its' fashion , nearly as satisfying and thrilling as MILLION DOLLAR BABY . great motion picture making . great entertainment . the coda that was needed .</p></body></html>

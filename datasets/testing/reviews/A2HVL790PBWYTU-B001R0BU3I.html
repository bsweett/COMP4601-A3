(well, I own it, too, but not in the same way...)"></head><body><p>If you haven't yet caught on that Don Cheadle is a fantastic actor, then peep this movie and let the lightbulb turn on. Cheadle is amazing in TRAITOR. It's a credit to his ability to keep things internal yet unveil just enough of what's going on inside that not only are you uncertain as to his character's true allegiance, but you grow to care and you cross your fingers hoping that he's on the right side.<br /><br />What sort of person might you become had you, as a child, witnessed a loved one become a casualty of terrorism? The answer to this is what haunts this film, and is what truly drives the storyline. Young Samir Horn (Cheadle), having seen his father killed in a car bomb explosion, grows up to be an operative in the U.S. Army's Special Forces. But, years later, an FBI-affiliated raid in Yemen catches him selling semtex to a terrorist cell, and Samir ends up in a Yemeni prison. He eventually breaks out, thanks to a befriended jihad leader. His new friend gives Samir a choice: Samir can now go his own way or he can become part of the cause. Samir goes for the latter.<br /><br />Someone once told Samir: "It's clear to me that you're not a fanatic. An opportunist, perhaps, but not a fanatic." Early on I couldn't help wondering: Is Samir merely a mercenary arms dealer? Or is he himself a terrorist? Or something else?<br /><br />Back in Washington, the FBI Special Task Force sniffs out an alarming international conspiracy, connecting it to bombings which took place in Rome, Berlin and Amsterdam. And Samir's name surfaces. Special Agent Clayton (Pearce) is tasked with getting at the truth. And because this film is an intelligent, circuitous thriller, that truth is a hard-gotten thing. As he probes and prods and encounters traces of Samir around the globe, even amidst further bombings, Clayton unearths just enough contradictory facts to make him question Samir's role in these acts.<br /><br />I was surprised at how easily I was drawn into this movie. TRAITOR is dark and provocative cinema, and even though it boasts other fine actors, whether the film works or not hinges on Don Cheadle. Thankfully, plonk this guy down in any character-driven story and he'll shine. TRAITOR trades on politics and dirty espionage, and uses Samir Horn as a prism thru which it explores moral complexities and the underpinnings of faith and religion and what constitutes a good man. How far do you go to do the right thing? Is the big picture worth an innocent life or two? Cheadle kept me in the dark as to which side he's on, until the film decided it was time to show me. Yet the film makes it clear that Samir Horn is a devout Muslim (although, to segue a bit, when Agent Clayton describes Samir as a devout Muslim, Samir's mother corrects him: "He's a Muslim. I don't believe there is a sliding scale." This is one more religious contention brought up here). Even as Samir gets sucked in deeper and deeper into the world of terrorism, there's no questioning that Samir feels true remorse over the killings he's caused. The question is, is that regret enough to dissuade him? Again, which side is he on?<br /><br />Samir's friendship with a terrorist makes things murkier. Said Taghmaoui, who plays Omar, is very good, certainly good enough that I couldn't help but like the guy. It helps, I guess, that Omar, even though steadfast to his cause, is nuanced enough and conflicted enough that smidgens of humanity leak out.<br /><br />The bonus features on this single disc: an audio commentary by Don Cheadle and Writer/Director Jeffrey Nachmanoff; two featurettes - "Action!" (4:39 minutes, concerning the film's action set pieces) & "International Espionage" (5:11 minutes, concerning the film's international on-site locations); and the movie trailer.<br /><br />TRAITOR doesn't come with wall-to-wall action; the explosions and tussles and gun fights are spread throughout the film and done to serve the story, instead of as mere eye candy stuff. Samir Horn comes off as more realistic, in the sense that he may have been Special Forces but that doesn't mean he can go up against sheer numbers and win out. On a one-on-one, though, he can hold his own. And, we find out, he can't dodge bullets.<br /><br />I like that there's no easy way out here. As the film goes on, options narrow to inevitable, gut-wrenching decisions; the light at the tunnel's end grows dimmer. A man of true faith is caught in the crosshairs and forced to commit heinous acts, and then has to face up to what he's done. Don Cheadle completely embodies his character, and makes you feel Samir's soul-wrecking torment and revulsion. And, by this point, if you haven't yet caught on that Don Cheadle is a fantastic actor...</p></body></html>

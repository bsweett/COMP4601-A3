<meta name="summary" content="An interesting film..."></head><body><p>This comedy is about the dangers of our nuclear age. Doctor Strangelove is a spoof about the insanity produced by those who concentrate in seeking power, for power corrupts and absolute power has a tendency to corrupt absolutely.<br /><br />General Jack D. Ripper, played by Sterling Hayden, is after purity of bodily fluids and wants to rid the world of Communism, therefore he orders a squadron of bombers to penetrate Russian soil and eliminate key places to destroy this enemy of the free world.<br /><br />The President of the United States, played by Peter Sellers, who by the way, plays several roles during this film, from the war room, gets involved in negotiations for peace, and the give and take is simply... hilarious. Simply love when he says: "you can't fight in the war room, that behavior is unacceptable in the war room." Peter Sellers is also the British soldier who attempts to prevent the bombing of Russia, and the bomb-maker, the... Strange-love Doctor.<br /><br />We realize that the movie must have been seen as a daring move during its release, but today, we have gone beyond the fear of making the bomb, to the realization that at anytime... we are in danger of taking weapons to the point of self-destruction.<br /><br />An interesting film.</p></body></html>

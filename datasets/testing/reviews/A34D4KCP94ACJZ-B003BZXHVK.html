I could spend a lot of time getting into why Brett Ratner is as much to blame for the this as Joel Shumacher was for the near fall of the cinematic Batman.  We may very well be one sequel away from a screenplay riddled with puns and fight scenes choreographed like a Broadway show or Disney on ice.  Don't hold me to it...all I'm saying is that this disappointing garbage is a few more steps in that direction.<br /><br />X3 (because us American's love for our blockbuster movies to have the shortest colloquialisms possible) mimics the Dark Phoenix saga by legendary comic writer Chris Claremont, and it mixes that arc with a newer story I'm not so familiar with. I'm assuming this is where the idea of the mutant cure comes from.  In short, there is a cure available and it might mean the end of mutants, so we might be tempted to ask ourselves some important questions and a better filmmaker like Bryan Singer may have made these questions far more clear and allowed the answers to cut more deeply.  We've developed differently our whole lives, so how much would we really enjoy being like everyone else on Earth?  What does Mystique, a shape-shifter who prefers to walk around blue and scaley as opposed to adjusting her appearance like we know she can, really think of this opportunity?  What about everyone else and how can a director address this with such a large cast?  Ratner is not up to the task of making these observations interesting...he does however know how to direct straight action and make a highly commercial film.  He did his job.<br /><br />Singer on the other hand brought a tremendous amount of emotion and soul to his films, and he did this without being remotely heavy-handed.  As a bonus he could also deliver straight action, but in his films we actually cared about the characters.  In the second X-Men film we got to see Pyro blast some cops in front of Bobby Drake's house and then we got to see Bobby fly away with the other mutants, but instead of seeing some more explosions and loud jet engines, we see Bobby briefly glance at his family who just betrayed him...and we connect.  Here in X3, I honestly just wanted to see the fire guy fight the ice dude.  I wasn't buying into the characters anymore and the all-too-often clunky dialogue didn't help either.  All the characters that were carried over from the other films are almost just empty shells of themselves from the previous movies, so I felt as if I had to think back to when I gave a damn.<br /><br />But it's not all bad.  Jean Grey's return from death in X2 as the ultra-powerful mutant Phoenix is fun to watch and the film doesn't pull punches to work toward a definitive end to the series (another reason an additional sequel could be dangerous). I'm not a real fan of the comic, but I'm familiar with it enough to know that hardcore fans have countless concerns for how there favorite characters are portrayed.  It's not a horrible movie in comparison to some movies of it's ilk.  The real disdain for me lies in how X3 betrays the depth of the first two films.</p></body></html>

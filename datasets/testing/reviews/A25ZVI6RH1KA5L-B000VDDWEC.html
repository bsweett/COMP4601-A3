<meta name="summary" content=""Okay Jim...I've got some bad news.""></head><body><p>So, did writer Alex Garland (The Beach, Halo) and director Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting) re-invent the wheel with the release of the film 28 Days Later...(2002)? I wouldn't say so, but they did serve to give the medium in general a good, swift, revitalizing kick in the gonsaticles, something every genre needs now and again as to not grow overly complacent or stale. Appearing in the film is Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Red Eye), Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest), and Christopher Eccleston (Gone in Sixty Seconds, The Others, "Doctor Who"). Also appearing is Brendan Gleeson (Cold Mountain, The Village, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), Megan Burns (Liam), and Noah Huntley (Event Horizon, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe).<br /><br />As the story begins we find ourselves in a research laboratory specifically one that seems to deal with chimpanzee monkeys. The lab looks relatively deserted (except, of course, for the test simian test subjects), that is until a small group of masked individuals enters...ah, the activists...anyway, a hapless technician walks in on the group and warns them some of the monkeys are infected with some particularly nasty and infectious virus known as `Rage', and that they should avoid letting the animals loose. Of course they don't listen, brimming with their own sense of self-righteousness, and one of the idiots gets bitten...by the way, I don't think they're idiots for their beliefs towards not using animals for such testing, but they are idiots for thinking it a good idea to let loose monkeys infected with who knows what...so much so I'd be lying if I said I didn't find some enjoyment in seeing the troupe reap the bloody benefits given their obviously overwhelming sense of self satisfaction. Anyway, it's 28 days later, as indicated by some text on the screen, and we're in a hospital. A man named Jim (Murphy) in a bed wakes and notices there's no one else around...the hospital is literally vacant. Not only that, but the city streets of London are the same. Newspapers indicate some sort of mass evacuation, but it seems not everyone has gone...a visit to a church yields a meeting of sorts with a few crazed, bloodthirsty, infected individuals, who Jim manages to escape from aided by a couple of norms, one of them named Selena (Harris). They fill Jim in on current events (seems Jim's been in a coma for the last month due to an accident), and Selena imparts a few rules to live by...after a visit to Jim's parents house, they hook up with a tower block dweller named Frank (Gleeson), and his daughter Hannah (Burns), and all decide to hit the road based on a pre-recorded, repeating radio broadcast promising salvation from the madness. The wanderers eventually find the source of the message, in a small, grabasstic military group holed up in a large, country estate, led by someone named Major Henry West (Eccleston), but not necessarily salvation as the unit has their own designs for the travelers, especially the ladies...<br /><br />This seems to be an important point to many, so it's probably worth mentioning...the term `zombie' is never once used within the film (as far as I can tell), and, in a traditional sense, those suffering from the disease do not appear dead, just overly prone to unspeakable acts of extreme violence, and thereby aren't really zombies (at least not of the George Romero/walking dead variety). As far as consuming the flesh of the living, I really couldn't say...there did seem to be a tendency to bite, and I suppose those `infected' would have to turn on the `norms' if only because their madness would prevent them recognizing any other viable source of food (tinned meats, canned fruits and vegetables, etc.), but I never really saw a close up sequence of the infected feasting on flesh featured in the film. The `Rage' virus seemed odd if only because it drove its victims not to randomly attack anything in general, but rather only those not yet infected (the infection passes easily enough, especially given the infected's penchant for projectile vomiting). Why should the homicidal loonies not attack each other, focusing rather on those not yet affected? I'm unsure, and it's never related in the story...oh well, a lot of things are left open ended, so it was no big deal. The one aspect I really liked about this film was when Cillian Murphy's character first woke, and then began wandering around the city, unaware of that which had transpired during his Rip Van Winkle impersonation. There was an entirely spooky feeling seeing him walking these streets that should have been normally teeming with life, hustling and bustling crowds all intent on fulfilling whatever purpose they have at the moment. Does the plot here offer up anything we really haven't seen before? Not really, but what it does do is give it a good once over, sort of a fresh spin, and juice things up in general. I had a lot of fun with this film for the first half (the flaming `Ragers' were amazing, and the gas station explosion sequence incredible), but then things got a little draggy during the latter half of the movie, after the initial group hooks up with the military types running their own program. I spoke earlier how director Boyle `juiced things up'...one way he did this was by shooting the film (a majority of it) using digital cameras. The effect is to sort of break down the barrier between the screen and the audience, almost like your watching live TV rather than scenes choreographed for a film. All in all a strong film with a solid sense of direction, despite the story getting a little predictable near the end.<br /><br />The anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) picture on this DVD is clear, sharp, and exceptionally clear, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio comes through clean. As far as extras, there's quite a bit including a commentary track with director Boyle and writer Garland, six deleted scenes with optional commentary, still photo galleries, a music video, animated storyboards, a `making of' featurette titled `Pure Rage: The Making of 28 Days Later', and three, alternate endings...the first is slightly more depressing than the one actually used in the film, the second a little less so, introducing a relatively new character to replace one that got lost, and then the third, titled the `Radical Alternative Ending' excludes virtually the last third of the film, offering a completely different tale all together.<br /><br />Cookeiman108<br /><br />If I learned anything from this film it's that Cillian Murphy can't grow a decent beard to save his life...</p></body></html>

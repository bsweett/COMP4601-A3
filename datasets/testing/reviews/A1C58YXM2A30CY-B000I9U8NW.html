Reed Richards is a science geek and a dork and Victor is a wise guy who thinks he owns the world, both out to get the love of Sue Storm (played deliciously by Jessica Alba).<br /><br />With origin stories in comics there is a pretty fast few pages and panels that explain what's going on and it's done.  For a movie though they need to flesh out the characters which I feel they did here.<br /><br />The space scene where Ben is outside and about to get fried and Victor wants to keep him out there shows who we're dealing with in Victor.  All five get powers from the storm (a deviation from the original comics story but that's fine).<br /><br />The action scenes include fights with Von Doom and a lot of falling, water, fire and even guided missles in the works.<br /><br />What works for me in this film are the character development, including the tension of relationships not only between themselves but between themselves and the media.  The media and fans and fads are put into a pretty bright spotlight here.  Not only a comic book  movie but one that relates a message about people as social beings.<br /><br />Not your usual shoot-em-up sci-fi film.<br /><br />"Silver Surfer" was in a lot of ways the better film but we needed Fantastic Four to lay the groundwork.  Hopefully there will be a third film soon.  Great cast.  I especially liked how they handled the blind Alicia (the Thing's girlfriend).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VI70QS">Fantastic Four - Rise of the Silver Surfer</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a triumphant film"></head><body><p>"Ghost World" is a rare movie find, a shrewdly observant tale of societal outcasts that, in its own low-keyed, understated way, offers profound insights into the workings of human nature.  It is rare to see a film this confident in its purpose and tone.  Writer/director Terry Zwigoff and co-writer Daniel Clowes have fashioned a tale totally lacking in the sort of sensationalistic melodrama that blights so many films dealing with the issue of teenage alienation and angst.  Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson portray Enid and Rebecca, two long time friends who have just been released from that prison known as high school and are now forced to make their way in a world full of people towards whom they feel utterly contemptuous.  Enid and Rebecca, like many youngsters who find it hard to fit in, camouflage their insecurities in a cloak of blas&eacute; cynicism, adopting a tone of superiority to all the "cool" people who have rejected them.  Indeed, to these two young women, even being "cool" is uncool, so they comfort each other with the knowledge that they are simply too good for the society around them.  The problem is that while this "pose" may suffice to get one through high school, it becomes a definite hindrance when one is confronted by the realities of life on the outside - finding a job, planning a future, establishing relationships.  <p>In the latter department, Enid finds herself drawn to an awkward middle-aged man named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who is, in many ways, an older version of herself, a socially backward "dork" who frankly admits that the reason he collects so much memorabilia is because he prefers objects to people.  Enid and Seymour strike up a tentative relationship, but what makes "Ghost World" so extraordinary is that we never quite know where the story is going.  The writers don't go for the obvious plot turns so that, even by the end, although we leave the film feeling satisfied, we don't sense that all the loose ends have been tied up into a nice neat little package for our facile consumption.  In fact, it is the very ambiguous, open-ended nature of the film that makes it seem so truthful.  Even the characters remain strangely enigmatic throughout.  Rebecca begins to feel the stirrings of conformity as she starts working at a job and looking for an apartment in a conventional suburban neighborhood.  This tension causes the girls to start drifting apart, as does Enid's sudden interest in Seymour, a relationship Rebecca begins to view with a measure of jealousy and resentment.  Enid is also very recognizable in her refusal to confront the people who mean the most to her when times of conflict or crisis arise - preferring to let her answering machine cope with her problems for her, in the vain (but all too human) belief that by screening her calls she will also be screening herself from some of the problems she has helped to create.  We also see how these generally lost, but well-intentioned people, allow themselves to do very hurtful things to the people they love.  The emotional terrain of this film is surprisingly credible and complex.<p>As far as I can tell, there is really not an untrue moment in "Ghost World."  It creates fascinating characters and remains true to them to the end, never requiring them to utter a false-sounding statement or indulge in cheap theatricalities to get the point across.  Birch, Johannson and Buscemi give dazzlingly understated performances, never missing a beat as they create this strangely charming "ghost world" full of people who feel unconnected to the corporeal world around them.  On every level this film is a certified triumph.</p></body></html>

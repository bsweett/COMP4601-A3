<meta name="summary" content="WELL..."></head><body><p>This movie contains some of the most laughable dialog in recent memory, as well as some of the most ridiculously bad performances EVER in a movie (the Laura Dern/Richard Attenborough scene over the ice cream is classic).  Yet  the terrors are great fun, and, though over-the-top with a typical  Spielberg flourish, deliver in spades.  I particularly love the raptors in  the kitchen and of course the T-Rex, whenever he/she appears.  But unlike  so many of Spielberg's other movies, this one has not held up in terms of  watching it over and over -- after two viewings, I am essentially DONE.  I  think the violence is extreme for kids, so if you are looking for something  for the family and have younger kids, wait a few years.  The special  effects still look terrific, and the basic conceit of dinosaurs somehow  being resurrected certainly inspires one with awe; too bad the populace and  script surrounding this idea are so often ignored. Since this movie was  being completed at the same time Steven was wrapping Schindler's List,  which is infinitely more considered, perhaps Steven figured it would still  make a gazillion dollars without too much attention to, oh, CHARACTERS or,  oh, PLOT.  He was right, of course.</p></body></html>

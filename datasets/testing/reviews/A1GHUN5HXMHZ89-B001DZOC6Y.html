<meta name="summary" content="The Happening"></head><body><p>Although "The Happening" may not be as affective as previous M. Night Shyamalan movies, it is still worth at least a rental. I am afraid I wasn't as happy with Mark Wahlberg's performance as I would have liked. I couldn't help wondering if someone else may have done a better job. In time this movie may be worth buying for the right price for it still beats out the overly bloody horrors in my book. To many of them no more that get you interested in a person before proceeding to hack them to pieces. It is true this certainly has some bloody scenes, but they are not gratuitous violence and they are used to further the plot. A couple known actors and the rest the cast are strangers. This helps us feel alone without preconceptions for the most part.<br /><br />People start killing themselves in large cities on the East coast. At first they believe it is a toxin released by terrorists that is the cause. Later many other theories are developed, but the one about plants  releasing a toxin seems the most likely. Watch out "Day of the Triffids". Well not quite, in fact I would have liked to seen some walking plants, but we just see the wind blowing them. Still fairly spooky, I found it entertaining enough to watch the whole movie even though Walhberg has limited range in acting. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Signs".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

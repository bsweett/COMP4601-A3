But this 1966 film has is where Leone moves from his first two spaghetti westerns, the Akira Kurosawa inspired "For a Fistful of Dollars" ("Per un pugno di dollari") and "For a Few Dollars More" ("Per qualche dollaro in pi&ugrave;"), and starts playing on a grander scale.<br /><br />In listening to the commentary on the DVD version of "Once Upon a Time in the West" I learned that all of the actors in his films were dubbed because Leone did not bother with sound when he went out to shoot his movies. If you remember how the invention of sound destroyed the more cinematic aspects of the movies by restricting movement so that actors could be near microphones, then you can appreciate the sense of freedom this gave Leone. The result is a distinctive style that goes well beyond Leone's signature juxtaposition of wide vistas and extreme close ups (often in a single shot, without a cut). Leone also likes to take his time, as evidenced by the final three scenes of the film, where Tuco searches for the grave with the gold, the three-way gunfight, and the parting of the two survivors. His films ran long and were routinely shortened (read: "butchered") for their American releases. But even so, there is a clearly boldness and a flavor to Leone's cinematic vision of the west that is as distinct as that of John Ford or any other classic Hollywood director of westerns you want to name.<br /><br />In the final film of Leone's "Man With No Name" triology, Clint Eastwood (now called Blondie instead of Joe and Manco but obvious the "Good" guy) has a new scam going as a bounty hunter who saves his captures from the rope so that the reward goes up and he can move on to the new town and do the same thing all over again. His pigeon, the "Ugly" Tuco (Eli Wallach), is not exactly happy with the arrangement and finally has the opportunity to reverse their situation. However the former partners find a new unity of purpose when a dying man tells each of them part of the secret location of $200,000 in captured Union cold. Our story takes place in the New Mexico territory (that is where the two particular generals mentioned had minor skirmishes during the Civil War), and the Yankees and Rebels are between the two and the gold. Then, there is the "Bad" Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), called Angel Eyes, who has also been on the trail of the gold.<br /><br />From an acting perspective the most impressive performance is that of Wallach, although this is partly by default. Tuco never stops talking while Blondie is a man of very few words (but great timing) and Angel Eyes communicates best when he narrows his eyes and glares at people. In the hands of another actor Tuco might have been more of a buffoon, but Wallach develops one of the most multi-dimension characterizations in the history of Westerns. In those brief moments when Tuco stops talking you can see his mind turning over what to do next before heading off full throttle in a new direction.<br /><br />"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" does stand on its own, even though it is the final film of a triology. I originally saw the film in a movie theater and did not see the previous two Leone-Eastwood collaborations until decades later on late night television. But while the order in watching Leone's films is of little consequence to the appreciation of any particular one of them, at some point you should enjoy going through them in chronological order to see exactly how within a five year period he went from ripping off Kurosawa to creating what remains my favorite western of all time.</p></body></html>

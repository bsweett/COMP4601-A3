<meta name="summary" content="Re-starting and re-writing Clancy's Ryan"></head><body><p>Don't expect the Clancy book... don't even expect Clancy's plotting (they changed the bad guys, foolishly).  They also made Jack Ryan a rookie so Ben Affleck could portray him.  It doesn't fit in with the previous Baldwin/Ford films in the Ryan series.<br />It's a prequel in terms of the character, but a sequel in terms of being set in modern day.<p>Got that?<p>Let me start again.  As a cold-war gone hot kind of suspense thriller it will probably hold your interest.  It's a talky,<br />outsmart the politicians kind of a thing, mostly.  Morgan Freeman is charismatic and always a pleasure to watch.  Affleck is... well... probably about what you would expect.  He's not a bad actor, but he's not a particularly good one (at least here)either.  When you finally get to the big scene.. it's a let down and the film still has a half hour or so before it wraps up. During that last half-hour credibility really stretches.<p>Good for a rental, and Freeman's performance.</p></body></html>

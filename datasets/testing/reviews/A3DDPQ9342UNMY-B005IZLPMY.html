<meta name="summary" content="Unpretentious, good-humored summer blockbuster has all the required trimmings..."></head><body><p>There's an air of genial and gentle good humor pervading the early scenes in "Captain America" whereby we're treated to the scenes involving the scrawny but scrappy young man Steve Rogers before his body transformation into the title hero makes him look like he stepped out of a recruiting poster. And this combination of humor and charm continues even as the tale becomes full of the revenge motif once our hero embarks on his more dangerous course as the man who must fight his nemesis, The Red Skull, rescuing the world as well as his good buddy from enemy hands. CHRIS EVANS is highly capable of making us believe in his "Captain America," before and after the transformation.<br /><br />As summer blockbusters go, "Captain America" ranks with one of the best. Within the scope of little more than two hours it sets up the Marvel comic with a flair and style worthy of more important material, succeeding in recreating the WWII era (from a World's Fair with art deco touches to the USO entertainments), with costumes, sets and characters all firmly set in traditional 1940s style.<br /><br />And the cast is up to bringing all this material to life. HUGO WEAVER has a fine time as the crazed mastermind out to ruthlessly destroy his enemies. He's a sort of Conrad Veidt villain on steroids. TOMMY LEE JONES as a gruff colonel with a heart of gold, HAYLEY ATWELL as a pretty soldier who knows how to throw a punch, and SEBASTIAN STAN as our hero's best buddy--all of them shine in colorful supporting roles. DOMINIC COOPER as Howard Stark and STANLEY TUCCI as Dr. Erskine bring additional humor and grace to their parts.<br /><br />Joe Johnston's direction gives the light touch where needed (especially during the USO shows where Captain America is being used as a poster boy before the troops), but never falters during the explosive action scenes.<br /><br />Likewise, Alan Silvestri's jaunty score never fails to support the on screen antics with some flag-waving patriotism suitable for the movie's thematics, and assures the viewer from the start that all he has to do is sit back and enjoy a well-delivered popcorn package of thrills and laughs.<br /><br />Recommended for all Marvel fans.</p></body></html>

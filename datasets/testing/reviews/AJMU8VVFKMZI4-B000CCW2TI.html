How could the bad guys plan the plane delay and what if the Homeland Security person simply refuse to move?  Plus the darn missle nearly knocked out the whole floor.  Seems to me that it didn't need to be that exact room.  I liked the fact that heroine had a steel backbone and didn't need any rescuing.  It's also very scary how both parties were able to escape the airport after landing after she stabbed him in the neck.  9/11 hasn't changed much (which is probably closer to reality than I like think).<br /><br />Overall, I can't believe this elaborate plan to kill the Homeland Security director all hendged on a hotel manager--but whatever.</p></body></html>

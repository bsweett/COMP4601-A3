Both movies shared the same theme of post-traumatic stress syndrome overlapping psychosis. The affected person could not suppress his grossly traumatized mind. His reality is distorted with persisting illusion and delusions. In Brothers, the viewer was told the News simultaneously from both sides of two diverse worlds, with nothing left for the viewer to predict or ponder.  As such, Brothers portrayed unreal, sanitized, and shallow scenarios.<br /><br /> In Shutter Island, the viewer lives with the mind of the inflicted person whose delusions led him to distort persons, time, and space, as his mind overwhelmed with unbearable trauma. The health-care taker is perceived by the traumatized patient as a fellow employee form the past work, as Federal Marshal. His incarceration in the mental asylum is perceived as mission to free the oppressed. His reality is a twilight saga occupied by his belated wife and children who were killed in mysterious circumstances. The traumatized patient is haunted by the people he killed or lost, both in his dreams and wakefulness. Once, he perceives those as being burnt in accidental fire, where his role was to pursue the culprit. Another, he sees his wife drowning his children and accidentally had to shot her out of his shock and loss. As his mind fragments, his health-care takers could not make as sense of any scenario he was telling.<br /><br /> The greatest strength of the movie was conveying the real experience of dealing with psychotic patients.  The patient is sharp and defensive in some brief moments and quickly relapses into delusional thoughts as his fragmented mind is flooded with painful imagery and emotions. Due to the patient's dismal hopelessness, suspicion and mistrust dominate his relationships with others.<br /><br /> Despite the fact that the movie was devoid from sex, violence, or comedy, the public showed great appreciation of the narration of the tragedy of post-traumatic syndrome.  Not only the Saturday's evening show was fully packed, but also did many people reserved the seats for their fellows long time before the movie started.<br /><br /> The only disappointing side of the movie was its abrupt ending without any meaningful outcome.  After an hour and half, the viewer has already assimilated the delusional twilight reality of the traumatized patient into the reality of caring for a mentally ill patient.  With the 1950's mental care, one would think that electric shock therapy could have brought such condition into some sort of normalcy.  However, the narrative of the movie was conveyed mostly as the ill patient perceived his own reality.</p></body></html>

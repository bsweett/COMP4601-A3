<meta name="summary" content="Psychopathy portrayed with Ruthlessness & Realism"></head><body><p>Psychopathy has only been seriously studied since the last half of the 20th century to present day. A psychopath can be non-violent, persuasive, charming, and on the surface seemingly normal. Then, of course, there's the violent type, who will pursue, torture and murder anyone or anything that obstructs them from their focused goal. What the two types have in common, however, is a lack of true emotion and particularly, a conscience. In No Country for Old Men, adapted from the Cormac McCarthy novel, the character of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) portrays the unyielding, unmerciful and ultimately dangerous psychopath with unqualified Realism. This is a film that will either shock you into disbelief or (as in my case) raise that pure terror that lies within us all - and as the novel and film ask, pure evil is among us and is unrelenting.<br /><br />On the surface this film could be categorised as just another bad-guy-good guy film, where, in the end, good triumphs over evil. But the message from the book and film is quite clear on this point: evil moves forward, inexorable and any sort of "rational" pleading with them or even an ample description of insanity is close to impossible. The quandary is that insanity by its very nature cannot be explained in rational terms.<br /><br />The plot is a simple one. A drug deal gone wrong; and an outsider comes along and grabs the money and runs. The point is, Llewellyn Moss, (Josh Brolin) is unrelenting as well, but does not really know what or whom he is dealing with. Brolin does an exceptional job in this film - a man with a mission, pursued by true evil.<br /><br />It is unusual for the Coen brothers to adapt a novel to film. However, anyone who has read the novel can see that the film faithfully followed the novel.<br /><br />I love all the Coen Brothers films as they all have an atmosphere, (even in their parody's) of true realism and a special view of the world.<br /><br />A film that deserved all the accolades it duly received.<br /><br />Excellent.</p></body></html>

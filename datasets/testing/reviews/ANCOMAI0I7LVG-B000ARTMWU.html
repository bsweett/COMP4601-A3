It's not perfect but it brings with it so much fear and paranoia I can't help but get swallowed up in its atmosphere.<br /><br />Before I get to deep into this review I just want to say that anyone who doesn't think this film was constructed around the Dean Koontz novel `Intensity' is blind.  The entire first two thirds of the film is identical to the novel (almost) so I have a hard time believing it was all coincidence.  What I was happy to see though was the third act since it scrapped the copycat routine and brought in something unexpected.  Now, just because it favors Koontz novel does not mean the film is predictable or passable.  In fact the film plays out so intense, so horrific that it far surpasses `Intensity'.<br /><br />The film follows two college co-eds, Marie and Alexia, as they visit the home of Alexia's parents.  Marie, you can tell, has not really experienced a home life of her own and so is a bit apprehensive of her stay, but the family is nice and they welcome her.  Before Marie really has a chance to get comfortable with the idea though, something horrific happens.  A mysterious man breaks into the house and brutally (and I mean brutally) murders Alexia's family and takes Alexia herself hostage.  Marie, who happened to elude the killer's eye, trails behind the killer in an attempt to rescue Alexia.<br /><br />Cecile De France delivers beautifully as Marie.  She captures the fear in this woman's eyes without taking away from the apparent determination to save her best friend.  In order to ready herself for her performance she underwent training to physically bring herself up to the task, and it paid off.  Maiwenn Le Bosco does a fine job but she is somewhat non-existent until the brutal climax.  In that climax though, she blew me away with her sheer magnetic realism.  I believed her one hundred percent.<br /><br />`Haute Tension' burrows itself beneath your skin and crawls around until the credits begin to roll, and for some time afterward.  As the shocking conclusion begins to unveil itself you will be beside yourself with anticipation.  The film is littered with gore, especially the unrated version, but the film is more than just a bloody mess.  It actually works at splicing the nerves of the audience as apposed to merely shocking them with beheadings and such.  `Haute Tension' is genuinely frightening, and that alone makes this worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Wes Craven was correct when he suggested director Alexandre Aja was the future of horror.  Watching this film as well as his polished remake of Craven's `The Hills Have Eyes' will help further impress that fact.  Aja has a knack for understanding what creates real fear, what picks at our sanity and infuses paranoia and I for one can't wait to see what he sends our way next.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thrill a minute movie"></head><body><p>This movie was so well done...instead of making it a simple movie of people being taken hostage, there were other factors brought into the situation that made it so much more exciting than it would have been otherwise.  Bruce Willis is AWESOME as usual.  Great supporting actors...the children were so talented.  I gave it four stars instead of five only because it left me feeling disturbed, as it most likely would leave anyone...and I had trouble sleeping afterward.  Well worth the watching and the emotional distress it may leave you feeling once you turn off the lights and go to bed.  Two thumbs up!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not for everyone taste."></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie a lot, even recognizing some of its big flaws.<p>The best part is Daniel Day-Lewis. It's a pity that him seldom works making movies. I wish he did more movies. He's one of the best actors that EVER lived.<p>The rest of the cast is also good, but simply does not have much material to work with. Cameron Diaz's character is lost in the middle. DiCaprio did his best, but, once again, the writers did not offer to him a good script.<p>Also great are the scenarios and the historic background. I mean, it's just a background, don'pt expect a history lesson here. It's like TITANIC, foe example, where Cameron used a hystorical background to tell a love story. Here, Scorcese used history to talk about the old cliche of revenge, the diffrence being that he got enthusiasthic about his movie and really tried to pass a message.<p>Good movie, it could have been better, but, I'm not a director, just a consumer!</p></body></html>

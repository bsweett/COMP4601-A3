They help Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) to revive the fantasy world that was once inhabited by the various talking creatures and king of the forest, Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson), after the land is invaded by the Telmarines.  And once again, there is the conflict between good and evil.<br /><br />The film focuses on Prince Caspian and his quest to recapture the thrown.  However, his leadership is in question.  In this installment of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, Caspian has to unite the creatures and people of Narnia and fight the Telmarines.  And one question comes to mind, is he able to return Narnia to its previous luster?  There is an array of themes within the film's storyline, leadership, chivalry, and camaraderie between the four children, Prince Caspian, and the beastly creatures, which gradually shows Caspian's strengths as well as challenges as a leader.  And this is displayed in one of the most powerful scenes in the film where Peter and King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) conduct a duel.<br /><br />PRINCE CASPIAN leaves the enchantment behind.  This film is a far cry from the first CHRONICLES OF NARNIA because of the intense violence.  With the haunting chants of the movie's soundtrack, epic cinematography, extravagant costumes, there is a darker element to this film; viewers may identify the massive battle scenes to THE LORD OF THE RINGS, 300, and the previous HARRY POTTER films.  And this will definitely keep people at the edge of their seats.<br /><br />Although the film has a darker tone, there are a few lighter moments.  The enchanted creatures of the forest of Narnia offer a little comic relief to the movie, such as Trumpkin the dwarf (Peter Dinklage) and Reepicheep the mouse (voice of Eddie Izzard) who almost resembles the Puss n' Boots character in the Shrek films.  Another defining moment is the touching concluding scenes where Aslan and Lucy reunite as well as when the children depart from Narnia back to England.<br /><br />Overall, the film is an amazing display of excitement and adventure.  However, due to too many disturbing scenes of violence within the film, it may not be appropriate for young children.  Otherwise, this is a movie worth watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Very Entertaining, Well Done Film"></head><body><p>The first time I saw "The Manchurian Candidate." I went so far as to think it was the worst film of the year. But then I noticed that everyone around me started to like it, so I figured. Why not? I watched it again and you can tell by my review that I liked it this time. The film is truly brilliant, it's got great cinematography, the acting is spectacular.<br /><br />Academy Award Winning director Jonathan Demme (Best Director, "The Silence of the Lambs.") is just amazing. The only true problem(s) I have with the film is, the ending which is way to drawn out, the beginning credit sequence (which is WAY TO DRAWN OUT) and the acting by Liev Schreiber is at some times horrendous. Schreiber is quite possibly one of my least favorite actors. The movies main character is Major Bennet Marco (Two Time Academy Award Winner Denzel Washington, Best Supporting Actor "Glory" and Best Actor "Training Day"). Marco served in Operation Desert Storm along side Raymond Shaw (Schreiber). The way things played out is rather mysterious to Marco. After the enemy opened fire, Shaw saved the entire crew and won the medal of honor. But, the crew also disappeared for three days. Now, Shaw is running for vice president (the man also happens to be somewhat of a mommas boy for Senator Eleanor<br /><br />Shaw (the terrific Meryl Streep). Marco begins having dreams and begins to uncover a conspiracy that involved Shaw and Manchurian Global, a big time company. Now, before I saw the film I wasn't familiar with what was gonna happen. I didn't know about the conspiracy part which is what I think turned me off about the movie. But, after my second viewing I noticed that this movies melds (perfectly) a number of genres:<br /><br />Drama, comedy, horror, action, paranoid thriller, etc. One of the most entertaining films of 2004, see "The Machurian Candidate".  A-<br /><br />PS, I have never seen the original. This review is for this film and is not compared to the book or original film in any way.</p></body></html>

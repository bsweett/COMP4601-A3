<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Adaptation of a Classic Fairy Tale"></head><body><p>Rapunzel is one of the stories collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in 1812.  The original "fairy tale" is hardly suitable subject matter for a Disney movie, but, as Disney tends to do, the story was adapted extensively for a modern family audience.  The result is a marvelous entertaining fantasy that is enjoyable from beginning to end.<br /><br />Mother Gothel kidnaps baby Rapunzel from her parents' room.  Gothel needs access to Rapunzel's hair because it has the ability to keep her young.  To maintain control over Rapunzel, Mother Gothel keeps her at the top of a high tower hidden in the mountains.  However, Rapunzel can see the world outside her window and her greatest fantasy is to see the flying lanterns that appear every year, strangely enough, on her birthday.  Things come to a head on Rapunzel's 18th birthday, when thief Flynn Rider comes into Rapunzel's life by scaling the wall of the tower.<br /><br />At first, this strange person frightens Rapunzel because of the stories Mother Gothel told her about the cruel and evil world outside the tower.  However, Rapunzel's desire to see the lanterns drives her to take charge of Flynn Rider as her guide to the source of the lanterns.  What follows is one of the fastest and funniest Disney animated features.<br /><br />Rapunzel, outstandingly voiced by Mandy Moore, charms everyone she meets.  She is usually cheerful and funny.  Though she is na?ve, she is also smart and clever.  She is also physically fit.  I guess there is little to do in the tower except work out.  She is also quite dexterous with her hair.<br /><br />Does Rapunzel make it to the launching of the lanterns?  Will Flynn Rider change his moderately wicked ways?  Will Mother Gothel have justice visited upon her?  What about the horse that acts like a bloodhound (you have to watch to understand - the horse is hilarious)?  You will have to watch this clever, funny, fast and charming movie to find out!<br /><br />This DVD has a dearth of extras, somewhat unusual when comparing this release against other recent Disney releases.  There are two alternate beginnings along with an explanation of both and a countdown of Disney's first 50 animated movie releases.  While this stuff is interesting, it is hardly earth shattering.  I suspect Disney is holding out more extras for a special release of some sort.  Oh well, another clever way to make money I guess.<br /><br />Disney has a good track record with its animated features.  This one is a winner and is already a favorite with our family.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

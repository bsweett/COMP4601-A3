<meta name="summary" content="A good movie but still disappointing"></head><body><p>Being a long-time fan of comics, I secretly look forward to releases of movies based on comics -- no matter what the subject. And while most comic book movies in the past have been shredded to pieces by a majority of critics, the comic book movies today are often crafted so well that they most often receive critical acclaim. Case in point, 2002's "Spider-Man." Everyone loved the origin story of Peter Parker and his struggles of responsibility with his power and trying to lead a normal life. Movie and comic geeks drooled over how well the movie stayed fairly close to the original comic. And usually I'd be with them. However, the first "Spider-Man" movie didn't "wow" me (I liked "Spidey 2" more), say, the way the original 1989 "Batman" movie did. Maybe it was because I've always been a bigger fan of Batman than I have Spider-Man, but, regardless, I just thought Batman was a better movie. Now comes the part of this review where you, the reader, say, "Are you kidding me? Spider-Man stayed more true to the comic and appealed to a much broader audience!" Well, of course Spider-Man appeals to more people, he's your everyman. I mean, seriously, who can relate to an orphaned kid who grows up to be a billionaire playboy? Not many. But that's what I loved about Batman; it was easier for me to accept that story of someone that insanely rich becoming that character as opposed to some dorky kid -- which I was myself in high school -- gaining some superpowers from a spiderbite. I mean, dorky kids don't get those powers and they don't get the girl. I did go on to write a novel that followed along those same lines of an outcast obtaining a "superpower" as a result of a prank, but the ending in my book differs greatly from that of Spider-Man. Now, I know, I know. This is a comic. A medium where most guys/girls can escape the harsh reality of life and become engrossed in fantasy. But that's not how I rolled in high school. I wanted reality. And while a billionaire obtaining high-tech gadgetry and becoming a masked vigilante isn't all that real, it's certainly easier to accept than some dorky kid becoming a masked hero and getting a variety of hot, young babes.<br /><br />Now, on to my second point, 2002's "Spider-Man" is closer to the origin story whereas 1989's "Batman" had the audacity of making The Joker the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents. Well, anyone who's a Batman fan/reader can tell you that the man who murdered Wayne's parents was a common thug named Joe Chill. And that made most comic fans blast "Batman" the movie. That's why in 2005's "Batman Begins," fans cheered when Hollywood finally got it right. Well, "Spider-Man 3" has gone from that upstanding critics fave comic movie to the same formula that had fans blast 1989's Batman. Didn't anyone tell Sam Raimi that you're supposed to improve your screenwriting as you go and not demote it?<br /><br />"Spider-Man 3" insults fans' intelligence by making Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman the killer of Uncle Ben Parker. Wow! That must sting to all those critics who blasted "Batman" for not sticking true to the origin. But now, even those critics are praising "Spider-Man 3" simply on its special FX. Oh, the hypocrisy. And then, to make matters worse, they give Marko a wife/girlfriend and ill daughter in an attempt to have the audience feel more sorry for him, which also is definitely not true to the original. Why the sudden need to have villains appear as wussies? Seriously. I know the filmmakers want to get the audience to say, "Oh, well, he's bad, but for a good reason." No! That's not how it is and not how it should be portrayed on film! While I don't mind a little creative liberty, there's still a fine line that you shouldn't go past. And "Spider-Man 3" definitely went over and beyond that line. They did the same thing with 2004's "Spider-Man 2," making Doctor Octopus some poor, unfortunate character who lost his wife in a lab accident he caused. Yeah, that's not the story! At least in the wretched 1997 sequel "Batman & Robin," the writers got the origin of Mr. Freeze right. No, no, no! Both Sandman and Doc Ock are hardass criminals, not misunderstood, heart-of-gold men! And that's how they should be portrayed in the movies. Now, as for Edward Brock Jr. and Venom, THAT they got right!!! Now, if you want a villain to feel sorry for, instead of Sandman, they should have incorporated The Lizard, who the filmmakers had a great opportunity to exploit as his alter ego Dr. Curt Connors is portrayed in the films by the excellent Dylan Baker. Also, The Lizard would've been a better choice seeing how he has that whole Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde persona that would've paralleled perfectly with the Spidey red suit/black suit persona storyline that Parker struggles with in this film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, overall, I enjoyed "Spider-Man 3" and found it was a thrill to see in the theater. But while the first two at least held a solid-built story, this one seemed a lot more choppy in parts. Because of its extreme attempt at jamming so much Spider-Man lore into one movie, it lacked that feeling of a complete story with a good amount of focus on each character. A good example are the use of Gwen Stacy and her father Police Captain George Stacy, played by the illuminating Bryce Dallas Howard and the talented James Cromwell, respectively. In fact, they're hardly used at all in the film! Which is a further insult to fans seeing how Gwen Stacy was Peter Parker's first major love and is so crucial to the storyline of Spider-Man. And to think that in Spider-Man 3 she is merely used as an insulting plot device to make Mary Jane jealous!? What an insult and what a waste.<br /><br />It's a bold move for Raimi to tackle so many story lines such as the Venom symbiote and therefore introducing Eddie Brock, the ongoing troubled relationship with M.J., the troubled friendship with Harry Osborn, Peter dealing with his feelings about his Uncle Ben's death, entering a new villain Sandman, and introducing Gwen Stacy and her father George. However, it was a bit too much. This movie had its funny moments (which come off completely dorky like the true character of Peter Parker and the comic), but it also had its scary moments. And while the two villains seem like a mere sidenote in this movie (not being as developed as previous villains Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus), the filmmakers are safe because, after all, the trailer does say that the main villain in this story is Parker's inner darkness. Like I said, this review may sound like an attack but it's just a warning to fellow fans/readers that it's not true to the original story. Now, moviegoers who don't know the comic that well (and only know the Spidey movies) will probably like this movie a lot. But it's not the dazzling story that's been originally written over the years and is an insult to true fans' intelligence.<br /><br />Overall, as a film, "Spider-Man 3" works and I'm amazed at how brilliantly the FX crews can bring Spidey's web-slinging adventures to the screen. The performances by Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Topher Grace, and especially James Franco (who STOLE this movie) are great, but, unfortunately, Howard, Cromwell and especially Church (who had a very limited amount of dialogue) were wasted in this film. The writing was off in comparing to the previous two films but the overall plot is interesting enough to keep audiences jamming the theaters for the next month or so. Bottom line: Although enjoyable, "Spider-Man 3" is a big movie, and that may ultimately be its problem.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Amazing, Important Movie."></head><body><p>As a fan of the original graphic novel, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, depth and emotional impact of this movie. Americans really need to watch this one (before it is too late), the story about a mysterious hero named V, fighting a facist regime in a future England.<br /><br />The most incredible moment in the film is the speech V gives when he takes over a state-controlled television station - this speech should be broadcast on American prime-time TV, it gets right to the point.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the ads for V, it is a drama, not an action film. Stuff does blow up real good but that is not the point of the film. The film's hopeful message that tyrannical governments fall under their own weight, great acting performances and great cinematography make V For Vendetta a winner.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Breathtaking Cinematic Triumph"></head><body><p>After the success of his 1957 hit 'Bridge On The River Kwai', David Lean returned with his 1962 direction of 'Lawrence of Arabia.'  A visual feast in every respect, the film brings out all of the drama and tension that pervaded T.E. Lawrence's<br />spectacular yet turbulent life.<br /><br />The film starts at the end of WWI in England with Lawrence's(Peter O'Toole) death in a freak motorcycle accident. After his funeral, various acquaintances give conflicting opinions as to what they thought of the man and his achievements; the film then goes back to Lawrence's obscure origins as a low-ranked officer in Cairo during World War I.  Relieved of his boredom as a map maker/surveyor for military intelligence, Lawrence is sent across the Suez Canal to Arabia to establish contact with Bedouin tribes who might serve as guerillas against the Ottoman Turks.  At first unfamiliar with Arab culture and encountering a somewhat hostile reception, Lawrwence earns the trust of King Faisel (Alec Guiness) and his protege (Omar Shariff).  After a series of successful guerilla operations with the help of another sheik (Antony Quinn) and his followers against the Turks, Lawrence becomes a legendary icon for the Arabs as he seeks to unite their disparate tribes into a single nation.<br /><br />This is truly another example of Hollywood at its very best.  The sweeping cinematography of the desert, in addition to being a visual feast, provides a strong thematic backdrop for the Arab culture at that time.  In 1914-1918, Arabs (meaning specifically peoples from the Arabian peninsula) were mostly semi-nomadic peoples grouped in clans or tribes with vast territories centered around vital water wells that were more valuable than life itself.  The film accurately shows that only Westerners thought of Arabs as 'Arabs.'  Paraphrasing the character of Antony Quinn's response when Lawrence proposes that all 'Arabs' should be united: 'I know of Hawitat and Hashemites, but Arabs?  I know no such tribe.' The film of course is primarily focused on Lawrence's character; the forces which made him a hero; the bonds he formed; and, how those events changed his life to make him a legend in his own time.  All of this is done by first class acting and the impeccable direction of David Lean.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of the greatest films ever made in which its images speak for themselves.  This is all enhanced by the performance of first-rate actors under the guidance of a talented director.  All of this accompanied by the legendary score of Maurice Jarre (Dr. Zhivago, Frantic, and countless other great films.)  Get only the superbit version as the others don't do justice to the cinematography.  This is a film for everyone's collection.</p></body></html>

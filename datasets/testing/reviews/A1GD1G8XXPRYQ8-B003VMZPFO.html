I wish it was at least a half an hour longer. It seemed that at the end the military got rid of the little town a little too fast. I really liked the idea of poison that turns men into a killing machines without a mind or any feelings. I wouldn't however call it a zombie movie. It was more like something else than a living undead, eating brains and meat of everything that is alive and has a flesh. Here people go crazy and kill each other like humans not like zombies. I would give it 5 stars if the ending was different and the whole movie was a little different. To me, military in here spoiled everything. Why couldn't there be military men, which couldn't survive? Or why were they not in a true hell? It seemed even that it was a little too easy role:be a military man, with a gun and unless director says you're dead, you're together with squads of other soldiers almost invincible. Eh,sigh. I wish there was some kind of twist where everything would just fall apart and crazies would not be that easily destroyed.</p></body></html>

It is a tale of gangsters and wannabe gangsters going up against a half dozen or so of the finest fighters in the lower class part of town.  However, the plot is merely a framing device for a series of amazing fight sequences that showcase not only the performers' incredible skills as stunt men (and women) but the filmmaking prowess of those behind the camera as well.  Writer/director Stephen Chow (who also plays the main role) turns his flesh-and-blood actors into the equivalent of cartoon characters, unaffected by the laws of gravity and physics, as they are stabbed repeatedly, fall from impossible heights, and suffer incredible bodily abuse, only to pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and continue on fighting as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.  The razor sharp editing and multi-speed camerawork - ranging from fast-motion to freeze framing - also contribute immeasurably to the surrealistic tone of the film.<br /><br />It's true that "Kung Fu Hustle" is definitely an acquired taste, and to those who are not aficionados of the art form, much of the movie can seem repetitive and silly.  And even for the most passionate of devotees, it can still be too much of a good thing.  The plot is frequently incoherent and the characters wafer-thin, but the stunning look and extraordinary energy level of the film make it a must-see for diehard fans of the martial arts.</p></body></html>

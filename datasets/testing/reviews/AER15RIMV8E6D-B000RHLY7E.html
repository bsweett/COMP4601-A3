<meta name="summary" content="Captain Spaulding For President!!!"></head><body><p>When I very first saw The Devil's Rejects in 2005 at the theatre, I hated it! I thought it was a piece of crap and didn't know it was going to make us side with the bad guys. In summer of 2007, I decided to give this a 2nd chance because Rob Zombie was directing a remake to my all-time favorite movie, HALLOWEEN! I like better now than when I first saw it. It starts with Sheriff John Quincy Wydell and his troopers begin a full-scale attack against the Firefly family. Only Otis and Baby make it. Mother Firefly is caught. Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding plan to meet at the Kahiki Palms Hotel. They torture and kill the members of Banjo & Sullivan, then they seek refuge at brothel owned by Captain Spaulding's brother, Charlie Altamont. Wydell turns into a vigilante and hires bounty hunters to find the Fireflys. Wydell threatens Charlie into giving up the Fireflys. Wydell then takes them back to their house and tortures them. If you love Rob Zombie's work, and have a crush on his smokin' hot wife, you'll love THE DEVIL'S REJECTS!!!</p></body></html>

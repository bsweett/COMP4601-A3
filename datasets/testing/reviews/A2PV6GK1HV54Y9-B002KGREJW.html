This film was nominated for best picture and Alan Arkin won best supporting actor, I was worried this film would be a disappointment but I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed this quirky flick from beginning to end. Abigail Breslin (also nominated) is ray of sunshine as a beauty pageant hopeful Olive Hoover, she is plain, chubby, and less than graceful but she has tremendous heart. Breslin's performance is pretty amazing for someone so young, and jeez she's been in like a thousand films after this one made her famous. Paul Dano and Steve Carell also star and probably have the best character layout in this film. I highly recommend this much-beloved gem! Enjoy!</p></body></html>

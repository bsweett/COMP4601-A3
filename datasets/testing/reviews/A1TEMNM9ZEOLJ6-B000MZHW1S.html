The white man/black man buddy/partner genre has been done to death. Here it is again. Throw in some S. Africa and Western guilt over what Westerners imagine must be going on in Africa and you have the usual formula. This has to be DiCaprio's worst movie, five Academy Award nominations or not. Still, it can hold up to a viewing if you get it out of the library for free, as I did. Avoid if you don't like an endless hail of bullets as your entertainment.</p></body></html>

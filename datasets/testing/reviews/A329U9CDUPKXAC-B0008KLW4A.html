So that in mind, I was able to find things I liked about Catwoman. The movie is nice to look at. Catwoman bouncing off the walls was enjoyable to watch. She was sort of like a female Spider-Man. The colors and the sets were all done very well. So that's where my praise for this movie stops. I was really amazed at how bad these actors could act. The actors didn't believe the lines they were speaking and it showed. It had to be some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The story is incredibly stupid. Beauty cream that turns people's skin to stone??? And why would the villain want to sell this much less USE it??? Did she know she'd be battling Catwoman one day? Or does she just want to feel like a brick? It's best not to think about these things. Turn your brain off and watch the movie. It might be able to hold your interest till the end.</p></body></html>

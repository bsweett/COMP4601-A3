<meta name="summary" content="Not one of Farrell's Better Movies"></head><body><p>This ridiculous farce along the intelligence level of Steve Martin's "The Jerk" does have its few funny moments and catchy lines (If you don't finish first, you're last!).  Race car movies are usually very boring ("Days of Thunder") but though this movie may be annoying at times it is certainly not boring.  Ricky Bobby was the product of an uncaring father who left him as a baby and would periodically show up and embarrass him (ex. Career Day at Bobby's elementary school).  As Ricky becomes a famous NASCAR driver, he constantly leaves a pair of tickets for his father at all of his races, hoping for him to show up.  When his father finally does show up at one race, it is not exactly what the audience expects.<br /><br />The actor from Borat portrays another highly annoying character as Farrell's arch nemesis.  As with Borat, there are a few of his scenes that had me cringing in embarrassment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This was a sad depiction of the most powerful woman of modern times!"></head><body><p>Margret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) is in the final years of her life. She suffers from dementia and often carries on conversations with her husband who has been dead for 8 years. She has many flashbacks to her younger years when she went to Oxford University and had a desire to go into politics. She was the daughter of a grocer who was also the mayor in the town in which they lived.<br /><br />She had a hard and focused personality but she has declined to the point where she needs constant care, supervision and protection. Her political successes came as she won three elections for Prime Minister of England and the leader of the Conservative Party for over 11 years......<br /><br />This movie has a major asset, the acting of Meryl Streep, who once again proves that she is possibly the best character actor of all time. Beyond her amazing performance this movie suffers for many reasons. Hollywood likes to take pot shots at leaders and this is no different. Margret Thatcher hated Socialism and Communism and fought to keep England a democratic and market driven country thriving on the intellect and inventiveness of its people. In the movie she is vilified (as she was during her career) but unfortunately this movie only seems to focus on vilifying her and illustrating her Alzheimer's and dementia.<br /><br />The most powerful women in political history also had as many admirers as those who hated her policies. She broke the unions and fought the government from printing money just to be more socialistic. The unions wanted a 30% pay increase. England was going into debt and high inflation was rampant. She helped lead them back to stability and financial security. She believed in taking action and fighting for what was right. She wanted to do something to make the world better rather than just trying to be someone.<br /><br />This movie was focused on belittling Margret Thatcher and depicting her as an old lady severely ill and as a bully when she was Prime Minister. Over 50% of the film was focused on her dementia instead of the powerful influence she had on the world. She was one of the leaders who helped stop the cold war with Russia but this topic was hardly even touched!<br /><br />The acting of Meryl Streep was superb but the script and story line was shameful. Hollywood does it again! This movie is not worth seeing for the story but the acting of Streep is the hook that will make you want to see it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic filmmaking and performances...one of Tarantino's finest."></head><body><p>A group of Jewish American soldiers in WWII has had enough, and is going deep behind enemy lines.  Lt. Aldo Raine wants 100 Nazi scalps from each man in his unit, and he means that literally.  But the Basterds will have to go against Colonel Hanz Landa of the SS, an insidious wrung-climber who will stop at nothing to get whatever it is that he wants. Who will win?<br /><br />The winner, of course, is Tarantino, who has reinvented history with INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, a truly glorious film that defies categorization.  It doesn't even, at times, feel like a Tarantino film; that opening scene between Landa and the dairy farmer is so full of tension, you'll have soaked your clothes in sweat within the first ten minutes.  And the whole film is somewhat sluggishly paced, which actually serves Tarantino's plot well; while we never really get close to the Basterds (for good reason; these aren't your lovable flag-waving soldiers, these guys are almost as sadistic as the Nazis they're pursuing), we spend plenty of time with Landa, as well as Shossana Dryfus, who escapes Landa as a child, only to re-encounter him years later.  The point is, we get close to some of these people--we learn to chear for Shossana, and learn to loathe Landa with every inch of our being.<br /><br />You'll watch this movie for one of three reasons, I'm sure:<br />1) You're a Tarantino fan, and so will watch whatever he puts out, even if it's a documentary of his bowel movements.  I won't judge; I probably would too.<br />2) You like war movies.  Well, you may not get what you want here--this is revisionist cinema at its finest, and this ain't your granddaddy's war movie.  It's loud and gory and with so much moral ambiguity, you'll actually consider rooting for the bad guys.<br />3) You've heard about the fine performances.  Eli Roth is slightly miscast, though he has so much fun in his role, it's forgivable.  Michael Fassbender is so smooth and cool, you'll wish there was more of him.  Michael Meyers is Michael Meyers (really, Quentin?  Not your worst casting choice ever, but it's up there.)  Brad Pitt is hamming it up hardcore and loving every single second of it. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger as the femme fatales are a blast to watch.  But the real gold here, as I'm sure you've heard, is Cristoph Waltz, who brings the movie villain to a whole new role.  Every single actor who plays a Nazi from here on out will study Waltz's flawless performance, and wish they were half as good.  Hanz Landa is the definition of "smooth criminal"--a dastardly, multi-lingual genius who has a knack for sniffing out Jews (hence his name, The Jew Hunter), though we're never really sure what his motives are.  Waltz--fluent in German, French, and English, and with a decent grasp of Italian pronunciation--plays his role to the hilt through four languages, and steals every single scene he's in.  If you don't want to watch this movie for any other reason, watch it for him.<br /><br />INGLORIOUS BASTERDS is easily one of Tarantino's best; for me, it ranks only behind RESEVOIR DOGS (though if somebody wants to argue for PULP FICTION, I'll understand).  This film is relentless, and is sure to piss off some people with its rather unflattering portrayal of the American WWII soldier, not to mention the guts Tarantino displays near the end.  Throughout, it is one violent, bloody ride, with laughter and terror and everything between.  It is a beautiful film, it is a brutal film, and it should not be missed.</p></body></html>

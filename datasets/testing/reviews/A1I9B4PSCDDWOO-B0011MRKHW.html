<meta name="summary" content="Poor movie....too bad!"></head><body><p>This was one movie I really hope that it will be impressive but as it turned out, it proves to be a really lousy movie. Cate Blanchett proves to be superb but she can't save a sinking ship like this movie.<br /><br />I am not going to get into details about the historical accuracy since like the first Elizabeth, this is more like a historical fantasy closer to the Lord of the Rings then history of Britain. But I would say this, the director really sucks and whoever wrote the script needs to be taken out and flog, and finally, who did the editing in this movie should not have any children of their own. Simply put, these three elements of the movie failed the paying customers badly.<br /><br />This movie appears to be a visual feast without a coherent story. We have poor Cate doing a lot of standing still, a lot close-up in her great costumes and a lot of staring. And yes, it quite visually fantastic and it would even be more if there was a developing script to all this. The movie appears to be over-edited as the plot move from scene to scene, each scene almost independent from other scenes. What you get as a result is a movie that don't make a lot of sense and where characters do things that don't flow with other scenes.<br /><br />Since the movie is a historical fantasy in the first place, I wondered why the people who made this movie make a pretense of history? If they are going to throw away the history books, do so and create a script and a movie that flow and tell a story - like the first Elizabeth did. That film is a total fantasy and that is why it worked just fine. This is why this movie was such a killer of time, for people who were making fantasy movie, they tried to turn it into some sort of historical epic!!<br /><br />This plain jane DVD (Amazon's description) won't cut the mustard. This movie really needs to be reedited and re-shot in-order to be save. I doubt if that will occur.</p></body></html>

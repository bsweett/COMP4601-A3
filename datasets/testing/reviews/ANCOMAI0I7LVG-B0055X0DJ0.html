<meta name="summary" content="Less than half a movie..."></head><body><p>I actually really enjoyed the first installment of this franchise.  I never got into the cartoon as a kid and, to be honest, I only ever owned ONE of the action figures (a T-Rex) and my father broke it accidentally and never replaced it, but I didn't really care.  No, I only went to see the film because my best friend at the time was insistent that we go, and so we did, and I was truly entertained.  Yes, it had many faults (the graphics, while amazing, were a little bulky and the film was overly long) but it was a great way to waste a day, that's for sure.<br /><br />This one, is just a wasted day; period.<br /><br />Hollywood, popcorn munching, big-budget, explosion filled, mind numbing spectacles have no business crossing the two-hour mark; ever.  Okay, so some of them have, and some of them warrant that (I still love `Armageddon') but for the most part, two-hours is pushing it.  There is only so much you can do with that kind of atmosphere, and if you ware out your welcome you diminish any affection one may have towards the film as a whole.  This film is roughly an hour too long.  In fact, once they reach the desert, it's pretty much a collage of repeated sequences that made me want to pick out my eye-balls.<br /><br />How many times can you have the same battle before the audience just walks away?<br /><br />I liked the college part of the story, even if the parents were gimmicky caricatures (the mother was the funniest part of the whole film though, and it should be mentioned that she is also the most memorable).  I liked the faux tension between Sam and Mikaela, even if you don't really care about them as characters (yes, she is hot and he is charming, but really, who cares?).  I liked the base storyline, even though after a while things got confusing and rather stupid and just completely fell apart in the end.  To make a long story short, it opened with promise (a lot of promise) but it just went downhill, fast.<br /><br />I'm one of those rare guys who likes Shia LaBeouf.  I don't like the fact that he is dating the ubber hot and superiorly talented Carey Mulligan (marry me Jenny) but whatever.  At least he is talented (who would have ever guessed that?) and so I really hope that he has a big career after this phase in his life is over.  I mean, it's a big thing for a star this young to get a franchise like Transformers, because it paves the way for him to make something of himself.  He is a household name now because of this movie, but I think he has more in store than this drivel.<br /><br />Oh, and can I just say that this films racial stereotypes (those ghetto robots) are insulting.  I was blown away that they would GO there with this film.<br /><br />I'd watch the first half of the film and then shut of down before it ruins itself.  Isabel Lucas is extremely hot here and steals Fox's thunder a bit (although she's only in the first part of the film, so BOO) and Shia keeps the charm coming full throttle in order to keep you somewhat interested.  The graphics are the same as before, except there is more of them this go around, and that proves to be a blessing and a malediction.  The forest fight sequence is great; everything in the desert is not.<br /><br />Seriously, turn this off about half way through and you'll be satisfied.</p></body></html>

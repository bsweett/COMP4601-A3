Though it beautifully captures the bygone English country lifestyle, this is much more than a doomed romance in a picturesque period setting. It is a story about the meaning of stories. In 1935, as Great Britain is on the brink of war, 13-year-old Briony Tallis (Saorise Ronan) has just completed her first play, which she intends to put on for her brother's visit. Her older sister Cecelia (Keira Knightly) is beginning to express her long-felt interest in the housekeeper's son Robbie (James McAvoy), on whom young Briony also had a crush. When envy and inexperience lead Briony to misinterpret Robbie's actions, her accusations have devastating consequences for all.<br /><br />Narratively, "Atonement" spends its most interesting day at the Tallis country manor. Briony is agitated by one incident after another. Cecelia and Robbie's flirtation is evolving. The guest list spells disaster. And this grand house, photographed to seem utterly labyrinthine, looms over everyone. Kudos to director Joe Wright for preserving the different perspectives so essential to the characters' experiences. But, thematically, it is the jump forward in time 5 years, then 60 years, that tells us what we need to know -not about Cecelia and Robbie, but about the fiction that undid them and that which preserves them. We're left, once again, to judge Briony's account of events, her choice of lies. "Atonement" gives thoughtful consideration to the impact of stories, while Keira Knightly and James McAvoy have great chemistry, and Saorise Ronan projects enough tension to keep us worried.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008): There are 2 featurettes, 7 deleted scenes with optional commentary, and a feature commentary. "Bringing the Past to Life: The Making of Atonement" (26 min) interviews director Joe Wright, novelist Ian McEwan, screenwriter Christopher Hampton, cast, and crew about the characters, the Tallis home, filming the retreat to Dunkirk, and themes. "From Novel to Screen: Adapting a Classic" (5 min) interviews Wright, McEwan, Hampton, and producer Paul Webster about adapting the novel to film. The feature commentary by director Joe Wright is interesting and informative. He takes us through the film, explaining his decisions, commenting on characters and how themes of storytelling and perspective are expressed. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in French, Spanish.</p></body></html>

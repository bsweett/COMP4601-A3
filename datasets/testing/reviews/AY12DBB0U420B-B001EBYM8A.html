<meta name="summary" content="And the Chase Is On!"></head><body><p>Every time I'm in a Ross Store I like to go to the ultra-bargain DVD rack and see what I can find. It's fun! I know, I can afford the regular price but when I can pick up "The Fugitive" DVD for under four bills, it just makes the viewing all that more pleasurable. OK. I'm a bit eccentric, but one has to have some method of choosing movies to watch late at night.<br /><br />"The Fugitive" stars Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in an action-packed chase movie. It begins with Ford (playing a prominent surgeon) having his beautiful and loving wife murdered and with him getting the blame, found guilty and imprisoned. Then, while he's getting transported from one site to another, he's inadvertently involved in a train wreck and freed. Enter Jones, a super-cop from the U.S. Marshall's office, and the  chase is on. Will Ford, the chasee, escape and be able to simultaneously solve the mystery of his wife's death and invalidate his prison sentence? Or will Jones. the chaser, and his super-efficient team catch the fugitive? Well, the chaser is amazingly close to the chasee throughout the remaining 3/4 of the movie until all is finally resolved at the end. It's a fun movie to watch. Lot's of spectacular action. Good visuals and interesting characters.<br /><br />The cops (ie., federal marshals) are just incredibly efficient, so efficient that it defies credibility. Well, it's just a movie, but if cops were this good almost all of us would be in jail. I know, I know, I can suspend belief in some movies but I had trouble with the federal police in this case. Funny, sometimes things will win me over and I won't even notice the discrepancies. In this film, I noticed and it distracted from the story. In any case, the film was a good value and I'll probably watch it again sometime in the future.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

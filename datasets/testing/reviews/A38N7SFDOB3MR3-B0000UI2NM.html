<meta name="summary" content="Fresh Story of Vampires vs. Werewolves. 65 out of 100"></head><body><p>Underworld is the story of the war between the Vampires and the Lycans (werewolves); a war that has been raging for over a thousand years. One of the great things about Underworld is that it takes  Vampire and Werewolf lore and fleshes it out, avoiding tired cliches, leaving us with a very fresh story.<br /><br />One could call this movie an action movie, but even though there is quite a bit of good action, it is at its heart a great story. There are unexpected twists and turns, and the writers go out of their way to avoid many of the pitfalls of using tired Hollywood cliches. For example, there is an attraction between a Vampire character and a Werewolf, but it never deteriorates into cheesiness. We are left wondering what happens after the movie ends as opposed to being tortured with loves scenes that would have been out of place in a flick such as this.<br /><br />Those who don't have much of a taste for action movies and monsters might hate Underworld, and those who think Anne Rice's universe is the only one that matters might hate it as well (because it breaks tired vampire cliches), but those looking for a fresh monster story will love it. If you liked Van Helsing, this movie is right up your alley.<br /><br />Understand that Underworld is not perfect, but it entertains. The story does drag at times when the action sequences seem to go on forever. The fight scenes start to blur into one big fight. But I was left wanting more. The worldbuilding was great. Anytime I walk away from a movie wanting to know more about the world, I give kudos to the writers. Underworld did this for me.<br /><br />A side note: some compare this to the Matrix? Other than a few minor fight scenes where the action flipping is similiar, this comparison is unfounded and unfair to both films. Underworld never comes off as trying to be Matrix-y. It is a modern action trend to have Matrix-like fighting scenes, but a good thing about Underworld is that they did not turn every fight scene into a fight scene from the Matrix. The use of modern fight cliches was limited.<br /><br />Underworld is worth seeing, and those who love it and get it will really love it. Those who want cliches or the Matrix part 4 will hate it.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 65<br /><br />27 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

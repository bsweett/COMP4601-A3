<meta name="summary" content="Wish I knew how much was fantasy and fact... but the music is great!"></head><body><p>I suspect I knew a dozen Johnny Cash songs prior to seeing this movie.  At its conclusion, I wanted to go out and buy the Folsom Prison album.  That probably makes it a successful movie!<br /><br />I did wish I knew how much was fantasy and fact.  Was June Carter really such an angel?  Did Johnny Cash really improve that much between his first and seccond song?  Did Johnny really interact with all these other famous musicians?<br /><br />The acting was first rate.  The singing was passionate.  The tension (or lack of it) between the characters was believable .<br /><br />I guess this movie was rated PG-13 for drug use and mild profanity.  This is a pretty good movie to invite friends over to see (when it comes out on DVD).  Enjoy.</p></body></html>

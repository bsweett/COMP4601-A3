<meta name="summary" content="Split Decision"></head><body><p>In every boxing movie, even before Raging Bull, the observation is made that the leading man spent countless sweaty hours with trainers and actual pugilists in musty gyms, getting in shape and practicing moves so that the fight scenes would be realistic. Frankly, the fight scenes in Cinderella Man are pretty darn good. This is why boxing cognoscente were surprised when Russell Crowe, truly fearsome in Gladiator and amazing in A Beautiful Mind, (also directed by Ron Howard), selected Nestor Estrada, an unknown concierge at New York's Mercer Hotel, as his sparring partner. Estrada, whose expertise lies in securing last minute tickets to sold-out Broadway musicals, not in bobbing, weaving, and absorbing full-force blows to the face, was an unlikely choice. But Crowe is no slave to convention and virtually overnight seasoned observers of the sweet science noted that he, "Threw a mean left telephone."<br /><br />This said, Crowe does not look like a boxer. Craig Bierko, on the other hand, as Max Baer, does. But this is not the failure of the movie. The problem is that Crowe's Braddock doesn't act, look, think, or express emotion like a boxer. Indeed, he has the sensibility of a file clerk or pushcart vendor, simply a man putting in another day at a dreary job. When you behold the monstrousness of Max Baer, you realize how flawed the construction is. Nobody walks into a buzz saw without powerful motivation, and "buying milk" simply isn't motivation enough, there are other ways to get milk, even for a simple man like Jim Braddock. His hangdog mopeyness lacks any of the braggadocio required to last even a round in a major fight, and his perpetually pained look, apparently on loan from Harrison Ford, simply doesn't jive with reality.<br /><br />Viewers able to forgive this will find much to like. Braddock is a wonderfully decent man, his morality is inspiring. Ron Howard knows his onions and did a lovely job with sets, costumes, interiors, (and cars!), the sense of history is exceptionally good. Paul Giamatti is outstanding, (forget Sideways but don't miss him in American Splendor). Renee Zellweger can do no wrong; I have never seen her give a bad performance. Try to avoid listening to the music; it's predictable, maudlin, and overwrought. Most of all, instead of seeing it as a boxing movie think of it as a morality tale of surviving the Great Depression. It works far better on that level, and Braddock becomes a far more interesting, and credible protagonist.</p></body></html>

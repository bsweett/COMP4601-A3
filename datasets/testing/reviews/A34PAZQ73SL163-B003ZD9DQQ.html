We often hear the phrase, "history reenacted," but so often it means "history embellished." That is not the case here as it seemed quite in keeping with the events Anthony Beevor outlined in his historical masterpiece, Berlin: The Downfall. It was as if he redrafted his text with actors rather than words. Speaking of actors, what can you say about Bruno Ganz? Best ever? He certainly surpasses the efforts of Sir Alec Guinness in The Last Ten Days. I'd put this performance right up there with Daniel Day Lewis's in Gangs of New York. I was not prepared for the way his Hitler in the bunker perfectly embodied the Hitler in the bunker I've been reading about for thirty years. The casting was absolutely unbelievable. With Speer, the director's decision was immaculate. That is the Albert Speer of the Nuremberg Trials. If you're a student of history, you'll see that the likenesses and mannerisms of General Jodl and Field Marshall Keitel allow one to instantaneously identify them. Eva Braun looks like the genuine article, but, when personality is figured in, it is as if she were crafted from an A.J.P. Taylor footnote. The only thing that struck me as being unbelievable was Goebbels' comment about how "the German people will have their little necks snapped." Goebbels was a tremendously evil man of whom nothing good can be said, but I do not think that he would have, or did say, such a thing. The lack of compassion of Der Fuhrer for the German citizenry is well documented, however, as two scenes with Speer make allusion to the infamous Nero orders. The great messiah of Deutschland was never much interested in his subjects--except for how they would allow him to be viewed by history. Hitler's mental illness is graphically evident in The Downfall, and that is yet another testament to its excellence. You could give me several days, but I could not find much to criticize about this movie. Even the title shines as it isn't about the bunker or the last days; it's a haunted requiem for the nefarious Third Reich. A state scheduled to last for a 1,000 years, but kaput by year 12. This downfall is as vivid, realistic, and worth your time.</p></body></html>

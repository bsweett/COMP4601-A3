Whatever the case Robert Downey Jr. did a great job. Now for the movie....yes its funny and something for the entire family but could use a little more depth. Afterall Spidey and Batman have some serious issues brewing (criterion/prerequisite for being a superhero). Perhaps we could see that in Ironman 2? Sometimes you have to run before you can walk...what a riot.</p></body></html>

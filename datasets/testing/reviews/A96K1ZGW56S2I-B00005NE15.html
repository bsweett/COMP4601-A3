Legend tells about a mysterious, glowing fog that has taken lives and swallowed ships over the years, but no one believes those tales until the eve of Antonio Bay's cenntenial. Car alarms, bells, whistles, and sirens go off for no apparent reason. A ship disappears. Windows break and strange knocks are heard at people's doors. When the missing ship is found, looking like it had been lost for centuries at sea and one of the dead crew members on board comes to life on an examination table, people know something strange is about to happen. As it turns out, Father Malone (Hal Holbrook) knows why the funning going-ons are happening. Antonio Bay was founded by six men who murdered a ship full of lepers after having taken their money. The lepers are back and want revenge and the Fog is how they will do it.<p>The film has a great cast, including Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis; a decent script; and some simple, yet effective effects. John Carpenter (as he did with HALLOWEEN) relied upon suspense more than graphic horror to send thrills done spines. A very good suspenseful horror flick that's especially delightful to watch on an evening alone in the fog.</p></body></html>

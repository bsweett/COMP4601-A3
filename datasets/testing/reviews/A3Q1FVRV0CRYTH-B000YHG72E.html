<meta name="summary" content="Will Ferrell is my favorite 'Elf'!"></head><body><p>`Elf' is probably one of my favorite Christmas films for its funny and sweet and original and did I mention funny yet?  I love Will Ferrell and so maybe I'm a bit bias when giving this such a high rating, but I can't help it.  I watch this movie quite a bit and every time I'm reminded of why I love it.  The story is about a young orphan who ends up a stow-away one Christmas when he slips out of his crib and slips into Santa's big bag of toys.  When Santa finds out he has a new guest he leaves baby duty up to one of the older elves (Bob Newhart) who never found love and thus never was able to have the children he wanted so badly.  When Buddy (Ferrell) gets older though he soon realizes he's not like the other elves and this sends him on a journey to find his real parents.<br /><br />This journey leads him to Walter (James Caan), his father, a man who horrifically lands on Santa's `bad list' year after year.  The fact that Santa is all but not believed in make it difficult for anyone, including his own father, to believe Buddy, but the viewer is moved to love him more and more with each passing frame.  This is a perfect role for Will, allowing him to tone down his over the top antics (I love those too) and give us a more family friendly performance that's as funny as it is charming.  As Buddy strives to gain his fathers love and affection he must also try and resurrect the Christmas Spirit that so many have lost. With great supporting performances by Zooey Deshanel and Mary Steenburgen, `Elf' is a delightful holiday film that is sure to please the whole family!</p></body></html>

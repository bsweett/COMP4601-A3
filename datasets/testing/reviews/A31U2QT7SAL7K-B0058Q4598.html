However, after viewing the newer version, I think it's a decent "revisit" to territory that, of course, was better done in the 1951 classic.<br /><br />The updated version - complete with state-of-the-art-CGI - has Keanu Reeves in the role of Klaatu, immortalized in the first film by the distinguished Michael Rennie.  Yes, Reeves plays it rather emotionless, but that's pretty much how Reeves tackles almost every role.  However, it seems to fit the part in the way it is written in this take; he should have no feelings because his intent is to wipe out all of humanity.  It is only through his encounter with Jennifer Connelly (as "Helen Benson," a nod to the character wonderfully played by Patricia Neal in the original) that the alien understands what it's like to be human.<br /><br />Jaden Smith, son of Will, is a bit annoying but the filmmakers wanted him to be that way, as he, by the film's end, realizes that stepmom Connelly really loves him and is the best thing that the young lad has going for him.<br /><br />Kathy Bates as the U.S. Secretary of State adds her Oscar-winning status in a rather weakly-drawn part, but she makes the best of it.  Kyle Chandler plays another one of his patented "cad" film roles [Thank God he's noble on TV's "Friday Night Lights"!] as a government official who realizes a little too late what "Gort" is capable of doing. John Cleese is on hand in a role similar to the one handled by Sam Jaffe in Robert Wise's original.<br /><br />And, of course, the fourth star of the original - behind Rennie, Neal, and "Gort," of course - was Bernard Herrmann's landmark and inventive score. Tyler Bates' music to the remake is adequate, at best.<br /><br />Speaking of "Gort."  In the new version, he is a 20-foot-tall CGI creation that pales in comparision to the man-in-a-silver-costume.  Lock Martin was much more menacing when he came down the ramp in Rennie's ship.<br /><br />Oh, as to the title of this review.  Veteran character great James Hong has a small but pivotal role as a compatriot of Klaatu.  Hong, like he did in "Kung Fu Panda" and innumerable films and television shows, brightens up every role and does no less in this film.</p></body></html>

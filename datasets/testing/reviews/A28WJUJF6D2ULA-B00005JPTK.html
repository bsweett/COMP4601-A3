Overall not a film to spend too much time thinking about as opposed to just passively watching sans deep analysis, a thing which tends to erode the suspended disbelief needed to make I Am Legend work. Will Smith earned his paycheck here more convincingly as a soldier than as a scientist, but on the other hand the mutants he battled were one of the neater CGI foes to come along in a monk's age. I Am Legend hasn't lingered in my mind the way a truly good movie will but I recall being pleased enough when I first saw its story of one man and his loyal dog surviving in a disquietingly vacant post-epidemic Manhattan. So, your call here. If you like Will Smith movies, grim futures, recumbent humanity and cannibalistic mutants-cum-monsters, you'll probably enjoy I Am Legend. If you're one of those "I Am Analytical" sorts, well, maybe a more cerebral cinematic outing is your poison. Either way, go have some fun. Jeez, everybody seems so serious anymore!</p></body></html>

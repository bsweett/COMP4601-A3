<meta name="summary" content="Atonement For My View of the Book"></head><body><p>Having put the novel down after almost 100 pages, I rented this DVD with trepidation.  Either I missed the point of the book, was having a bad week, or this director magically took dry prose and breathed life into it.  First rate story, acting, music, and even tears at the end made this a bravo performance and merited the Academy Award nomination.  Highly recommended.  (And, yes, I will try the book again).</p></body></html>

All of these movies originated from the pages of comic books.  In this case the source is the graphic novel of the same name written by Max Allan Collins originally released in 1998.<br /><br />Set in the early 20th century, Road to Perdition is a crime movie, road-trip movie, and stirring father-son drama all set in the era of Al Capone. For years hit man Michael Sullivan's (Tom Hanks) has loyally served crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).  One night, when a simple shakedown goes awry due to the erratic behavior of Rooney's son, Connor (Daniel Craig), several men are gunned down as a result, all while Sullivan's eldest son (Tyler Hoechlin) acts as witness to the murders.  Upon discovering that the boy was witness to the crime Connor Rooney takes action, killing Sullivan's wife and youngest son, but missing his primary target, Michael Sullivan, Jr. who is quickly taken on the road by his father.  With son in tow Michael Sullivan, Sr. pledges vengeance on Connor.  Meanwhile, John Rooney is forced to make the difficult decision of letting Michael have his vengeance or protecting his son, Rooney ultimately hires an assassin (Jude Law) to dispose of Sullivan before he has a chance to kill Connor.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place on the road with Sullivan teaching his son a lifetime of values, with stops to rob his former boss's banks and seeks forgiveness for his sins as the road brings him closer to enacting his revenge for the death of his family.  This journey is the titular Road to Perdition.<br /><br />The acting is as good as an audience could expect from this all-star cast, but what stands out the most are the interactions between Tom Hanks and Paul Newman (appearing in his final acting role).  A change from the graphic novel that phenomenally increases the human drama of the film is that Michael Sullivan has come to hold John Rooney as a father figure.  In return Paul Newman treats Sullivan as a surrogate son.  Paul Newman perfectly conveys the emotional conflict Rooney faces when he is forced to make the decision between putting a hit on Sullivan and letting Sullivan kill his biological son.  One can practically see his heart breaking when he is forced to make the decision.  Newman truly saved one of his career's best performances for last in his illustrious career.<br /><br />Even more essential to the film's success than the outstanding performances from Hanks and Newman is its cinematography.  Road to Perdition is an incredibly stylish movie, but not in the same way the graphic novel was.  Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall changes the story from an American set Samurai movie to a timeless portrait of American culture.  The Oscar winning cinematography is easily Road to Perdition's greatest strength.  Director Sam Mendes said that after the Best Picture winning American Beauty he wanted to make a film that focused more on telling its story through visuals instead of dialogue and he succeeds. The best moments in the film come when the dialogue comes to a stop it allowing the images on the film do all the talking<br /><br />A financial and critical success, grossing $180 million worldwide off a budget of $80 million and nominated for six Academy Awards (winning one for Cinematography) Road to Perdition was a success, but there was a very vocal few who considered it a massive letdown during its initial release.  Some complaints were centered on the belief that the film wasn't a stirring crime drama that viewers expected; some felt it was a disappointment from the stand-point of being Mendes' immediate follow-up to the Best Picture winning American Beauty.  Most all of these complaints seem to have died down over the years, but a large percentage of the population seldom acknowledges the film on the basis that it stars Hollywood nice-guy Tom Hanks as a gangster.  This is a grave mistake, as Road to Perdition is not a gangster movie.  Road to Perdition is a familial drama which happens to have gangsters in it.  Playing a father who must take care of his son during a trying, desperate time is a role that Tom Hanks is more than suited to tackle.  To go into this movie expecting a story along the lines of Scarface or The Godfather would be to completely miss the point.<br /><br />Ultimately Road to Perdition should be seen as a turning point in the history of graphic novels and their adaptation into Hollywood films.  The movie is an outstanding example of writers should adapt a source material in such a way that the heart of the story is kept intact while still offering something delightful and new for those who've already read the graphic novel.  The more action oriented themes Collins' novel were muted, but the strength of the father-son relationship, which was the true heart of the graphic novel, remained completely intact, and in some ways was even improved upon in the movie.  While movies such as From Hell (2001) were the first attempt at bringing graphic novels to universal attention, Road to Perdition is the film that sealed the medium's identity as an art.  As a result of Road to Perdition the graphic novel would begin to receive the serious attention it had been denied for decades with adaptations of Alan Moore's V For Vendetta (2005), Watchmen (2009), and David Cronenberg's adaptation of John Wagner and Vince Locke's History of Violence (2005).  If Sam Mendes adaptation of Max Allan Collin's graphic novel hadn't been the critical and financial success it wound up being it seems doubtful that graphic novels would have as much attention from production companies as they do now.  For that reason Road to Perdition is perhaps the most important movie in the history of movie adaptations of graphic novels.</p></body></html>

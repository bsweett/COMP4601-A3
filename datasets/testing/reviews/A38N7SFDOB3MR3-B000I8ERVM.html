<meta name="summary" content="Great Film. Incredibly Unsettling. 89 out of 100"></head><body><p>The Exorcism of Emily Rose caught me off guard. I thought I was in for a thriller/horror movie with the same old Hollywood elements. Man, was I wrong.<br /><br />The Exorcism, of Emily Rose is a movie based on the real life story of Emily Rose, a young lady who headed off for college and ended up losing her mind or being possessed by Lucifer...you decide.<br /><br />All the elements of a great film are there: wonderful storytelling, incredible acting, good pacing, and entrancing visuals. Jennifer Carpenter (as Emily Rose) puts in one of the best acting performances I have seen in a while. I am headed to find more movies with Carpenter in them as I write. Laura Linney as Erin Bruner and Tom Wilkinson as Father Moore are strong as well.<br /><br />Make no mistake, the Exorcism of Emily Rose is not a horror movie, per se. But...it is very scary. I found this movie more unsettling than any horror movie I have watched this year, and I have watched many. The scene with Erin Bruner in her home was amazingly tense. Also note that there is no blood and gore in the film.<br /><br />This is not a film with average frights, as it may linger in the minds of even seasoned fright buffs. I went to bed after the film (I work second shift), rolled over to look at the alarm clock, and it read 2:59. It turned 3 AM as I looked. I had to get up and check all the doors in the house. I was truly creeped out.<br /><br />I guess the fright in the film comes from the fact that it could happen to any of us. It also comes from the unknown. Was Emily crazy?<br /><br />Anywho, I can't say enough good about this film. It is a court drama, a story about people you will care about, and one heck of a frightening and unsettling film that tackles huge questions about God and demons.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 89<br /><br />48 (out of 50).

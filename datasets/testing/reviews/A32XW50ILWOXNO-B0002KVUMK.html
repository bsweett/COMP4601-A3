<meta name="summary" content=""Van Helsing" Van Stinks!"></head><body><p>About halfway through a silent screening of "Van Helsing," a boy in the theater, about ten, moaned to his mother: "This movie's not very good!" <p>If you can't nab that target audience, the adults are going to be about as penetrable as the Great Wall of China. <p>The movie is indeed atrocious: A flat, candy-coated monster mash that's about as scary as reading the back of a cereal box. <p>Universal gave writer-director Stephen Sommers ( the "Mummy" series) $150 million to pack the studio's classic stable of villains - Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the Wolfman -  into a quick, presumably fun flick. Sommers returned with more than two hours (!) of plot-filled dirge that focuses on the origins of its drab, amnesia-riddled hero (Hugh Jackman, apparently on anti-depressants) and his relationship with a buxom, plucky sidekick Anna Valerious, in a performance by Kate Beckinsale that belongs in the pantheon of bored, unphysical performances. <p>Beckinsale, however beautiful, is a slight, tiny little smoky-eyed girl; how in the world she got cast in "Underworld," then "Van Helsing," then some spy movie to follow in the next year, is a worthy homework assignment. And yet she surpasses, two times over, the work of Richard Roxburgh, who throws all drama to the winds and camps it up as a high-pitched, effete Dracula. If Johnny Depp channeled Keith Richards in "Pirates of the Caribbean," Roxburgh channels Robin Williams after he's had four goblets of apple wine on Disco Night in South Beach.<p>Dracula is only real villain of the picture - Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley, under there somewhere) is just a pawn in the count's elaborate scheme to bring his pulsating sacks of bat babies to life, while Wolfman is actually Anna's brother under a wicked spell. <p>"Van Helsing" features a series of showdowns, the best of which probably involves Jackman and his machine gun crossbow vs. Dracula's three winged brides. The special f/x aren't awful, just nonstop and, therefore, inconsequential. A relentless soundtrack booms underneath the picture. And Sommers, whether he ever makes another good popcorn movie or not, will never be known for fluid filmmaking. <p>But some of the blame has to fall to Jackman, who lacks wit, humor, playfulness - everything that made Depp's performance in "Pirates" carry that film to unexpected, giant box office returns. Jackman seems plugged in as Wolverine in the "X-Men" films and static outside them; remember his straight-man act in "Swordfish?" He's not even Brendan Fraser. Beckinsale - who was good as the ice queen in "The Last Days of Disco" for a reason - is no tart herself. When the leads are best described as "glum," what kind of blockbuster can you expect?</p></body></html>

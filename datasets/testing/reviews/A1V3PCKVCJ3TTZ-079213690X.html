<meta name="summary" content="Not quite sure what I gained by buying it"></head><body><p>The movie is an Academy Award winner for Best Picture, so you know the movie is quality and an epic vision of feudal England and Scotland.  Therefore I will not review the plot and story.  The quality of the DVD is good, but I don't see a significant improvement over other DVD's of the film.  There is some additional footage you don't get in the TV versions, more graphic killings, a bit more blood, and some extra love scene kind of stuff.  Other than being able to watch it whenever I want, I don't know that I gained that much in buying it.</p></body></html>

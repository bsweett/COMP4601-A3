<meta name="summary" content="A disappointment, the lack of relationships and the overwhelming power of the evil Terminator make it a weak three-quel"></head><body><p>This third installment of the Terminator series is a demonstration that a theme for a sequence of movies often simply expires from exhaustion after the third time. What made the second movie so entertaining beyond the special effects was the relationship between Arnold as the good Terminator and the young John Connor. The Terminator evolved into a father figure, sworn to protect John, willing to terminate in order to keep him alive. The bad Terminator was very powerful, yet had some vulnerabilities so that humans, particularly Sarah Connor, could join the battle. In this case the bad Terminator is so powerful that not even Arnold can stand against her for long. Although having a female Terminator was a welcome change from the previous ones.<br /> In this movie, there is great action, but it dominates and it is action to cover up the lack of the good dialog and relationships in the first two movies. The high points are the references to the previous Terminator movies; the scene with the sunglasses is the best by far, although if you have not seen the first two versions, you will not see the humor in the situations. I found this movie to be a disappointment, the action is there but the previous movies also involved relationships that are lacking in this case.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer had me totally convinced -- top notch and fun!"></head><body><p>This is the chick flick that I will have no reservations recommending to other "chicks" of my generation (ahem, those of us who can remember dancing to Rick Springfield and "Thriller").  No doubt some will complain that it's too derivative of an earlier kid-grows-up-suddenly film, others will grouse about the simple plot and lack of smut (as if that's a necessary ingredient to enjoy a film, hmmmm).  I say just enjoy the trip down memory lane to what it was like when we were thirteen, idealistic and joyful for all the right reasons.<p>Garner plays the fabulously chic Jenna Rink, editor of a major fashion magazine in NYC who apparently woke up one morning with amnesia for the past 17 years of her life (actually, it's a bit more complicated than that, involving some kind of mystical wish fulfillment of her geeky 13-year-old self to be "Thirty and Flirty", but anyway...).  From her point of view, she was thirteen one minute, and the next minute she's woken up one morning to find herself thirty years old and possessing everything she had always thought she wanted; a cool job, a fashionable wardrobe, a gorgeous body and a designer wardrobe that Carrie Bradshaw would kill for.  After she gets reoriented, she starts to enjoy herself, but only for a while because she is starting to find out things about her grownup self that aren't at all nice.  For one thing, she has cut her family out of her life to climb the corporate ladder, and for another, she has managed to alienate her only real friend in life, Matt - former boy-next-door/pal who had a secret crush on her.  This new life is shallow, mean-spritied and empty.  How can she "fix" it now that she has thrown away everything that she used to hold dear?<p>I have an immense new respect for Jennifer Garner.  In this film 13 Going on 30 she proved to me that she is not just another beautiful starlet cashing in on her look of the moment, but a real actress who can rise to the challenge of comedy.  It mustn't be easy to play a 13 year old in a 30 year old's body, but Garner pulled it off fabulously.  She was totally convincing as a kid who just wanted to have fun and make friends with the jaded, stuffy adults in her new world.  Yes, the plot is something like another film starring Tom Hanks, but the sheer girliness and `80s nostalgia of Jenna's situation was a unique take on the story that had me involved completely.  Garner somehow has that magical ability to be funny and vulnerable even while she's drop dead gorgeous (note, IMHO most drop dead gorgeous actresses rely on their looks more than good acting, so this is a high compliment coming from me).  Okay, I'm sure the writing had something to do with it, too.<p>Leave the guys to their guy stuff (unless your guy happens to think Jennifer Garner is hot!) and round up your girlfriends to see 13 Going on 30.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

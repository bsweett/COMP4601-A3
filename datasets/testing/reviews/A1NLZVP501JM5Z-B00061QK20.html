There are some great battle scenes and the colors and images are breathtaking.  But, this movie is more of a love story than a war story.  I liked the way it was told, although it will probably confuse some people.  Jet Li is a great actor/martial artist/stunt coordinater/producer.  The other actors are good too.<br /><br />The reason this didn't get 5 stars from me is probably the hype.  While all the battle scenes are great, for me, they ended up ending too soon.  I also wasn't expecting the complex story, which I liked, but there were just a few too many twists and turns thrown in.<br /><br />Overall if you want to see a good martial arts/romance/historical<br /><br />piece then you should see this.  Its a good movie to be sure, a bit confusing, but a good film none the less...</p></body></html>

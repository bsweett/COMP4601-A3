<meta name="summary" content="Liars and Cheaters Getting Closer"></head><body><p>"Closer" is a dramatic film, written and based on the play of the same name by Patrick Marber. I kept getting recommended it on amazon.com, so I decided to see it on DVD. I didn't know what to think of it before I saw it, and I still don't know what to think of it.<br /><br />Set in London, we see Dan (Jude Law), a wannabe novelist whose life soon becomes tangled up in Alice's (Natalie Portman), a waitress and former stripper. Dan falls in love with her, but also with Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer he uses for his author cover photo. But Dan doesn't stop there, he brings Larry (Clive Owen) into things when he bumps into him in an adult chat room pretending to be Anna, who he sets up with her. Lies are told, everyone falls in love with everyone else, more lies are told, everyone cheats on everyone else and time passes. That's pretty much it.<br /><br />Even before I knew "Closer" had once been a play, I could tell that it had been meant for theatre. The dialogue has that stilted, scripted vibe, and you can tell that not much has changed in the adaption scriptwise. Still, the characters are very strong, and the way they interact with each other is probably my favorite part of the film. It's well casted, but then again, if Jude Law's in it I usually like it anyway.<br /><br />The character interaction, though really strong and interesting, is about the only thing I liked about this film. All the smut, the sex, the lying, the cheating, the swearing, the strip clubs and the upper middle class banter I didn't find very entertaining at all. Also, the characters are so flawed that they're almost beyond sympathy. Sure, thinking about it I can feel sorry for Alice, because she's younger than all the rest and probably didn't know any better, but the rest...<br /><br />Whenever I see a film or play like this, rather serious exploring man's faults to a fault, I kind of wonder what the point is. Liars and unfaithful partners exist, yes, but when they and there motives are so meticulously explored liked this, it almost, almost seems like a celebration of these faults rather than a warning or something similar. When Jude Law's character pretends to be a woman in the adult chat room, for example, its played as if it was meant to be funny.<br /><br />There's a scene in the film where two of the main characters, Alice and Larry, are discussing art. They begin discussing the photography exhibition, and neither of them like it very much. Every person whose picture has been taken looks sad, jaded or depressed, but has been made to look beautiful. Alice says, they are made to look beautiful through art, but they are still sad and depressing. Who are these people, she says, who would pay to go see them? In some ways, I feel the same about this film. Great, great character interaction, but that's about it, the rest is a bit depressing for me.</p></body></html>

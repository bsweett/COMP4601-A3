If you do have that extra quality, then by all means, there's hope for you to enjoy "The Hangover."<br />"The Hangover" is an absolutely hilarious film starring Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Heather Graham, Sasha Barrese, Ken Jeong, Rachael Harris, Mike Tyson, Mike Epps, and others; about 4 guys who go to Las Vegas and end up having the ultimate time of their lives.  Only bad thing is they can't remember a damn thing and have to figure out what the heck happened.  This film is the perfect nightmare I've had most of my life that keeps me from going to Las Vegas.  Absurdity abounds and comedy is non-stop.  You can't help yourself and start laughing about fifteen minutes in, and then you just keep on laughing all the way to the end.  There is a sequel planned, and I'm going to get it, too.  Do yourself a favor and own this DVD.  Heather Graham was my favorite character BTW.  Good grief this DVD is a great choice IMHO.</p></body></html>

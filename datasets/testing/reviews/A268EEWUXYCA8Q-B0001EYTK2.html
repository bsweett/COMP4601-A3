<meta name="summary" content="Not good but not horrible"></head><body><p>At the beginning of this movie, the main characters visit a tour of horror; a carnival ride where the spooks hop out to give viewers a quick scare before disappearing again.  I can't think of a better opening and metaphor to this movie.  House of 1000 Corpses is just like the old carnival rides.  Once you get past the immediate shock response, there's not much left.  It's a very hollow scare.<br /><br />On one hand, Rob Zombie has succeeded in his goal.  He opens the movie with a creature feature presentation.  And there is the parallel to the horror movies of the 70s, particularly The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is very evident in this movie.  In this aspect, the movie calls to mind the shocking images of TCM and the unstoppable cruelty involved.  However, while it does evoke these images, it fails to hold interest.  Where TCM is now a classic of horror movies not only because of the violence but the characters, 1000 Corpses will fall flat.  It has an insane cast, no question.  But they are insane for insanity's sake.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching torture, and unquestionable acts of violence perpetrated on people in an almost voyeuristic sort of way and with no real reason why, then this is your movie.  Some reviewers have commented that this movie is great because it isn't a PG-13 crapfest that Hollywood has been dishing out.  While this is true, there are plenty of movies that are better that don't perscribe to this crappiness.  In fact, check out the French film Haute Tension (aka Switchblade Romance) if you want to see a horror movie that has the violence and gore AND a decent story behind it.<br /><br />I just can't really get into this movie.  Towards the end, I was tired of the mindless violence and torture.  And just when I thought it was over, it kept going.  It's like a train wreck that keeps piling up.  Once you get past the shocks, there's not much meat on this corpse's bones.</p></body></html>

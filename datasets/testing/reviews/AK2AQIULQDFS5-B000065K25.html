<meta name="summary" content="A Breath of Fresh Air for Crime Film Fans."></head><body><p>"Reservoir Dogs" is the most Original Crime/Thriller in Years, it has had Many, Many Imitators since it's Early 90's release, and yet it still holds the Most Original title. Quentin Tarantino Writes, Directs and Acts in this Timeless "Honour among Thieves" Classic, which is also his Directorial Debut. <p>Harvey Kietel stars a Mr White, one of 6 Professional Thieves hired for a Diamond Heist. Though we never get to See the actual Robbery, we do see the Aftermath. Dead Cops, Dead Criminals, Untrusting Survivors. As the Surviving Criminals hold up in a Warehouse Waiting for the Mastermind to come and Tell them what to Do, they start to think a Snitch may be among them and they try to figure out whom it may be.<p>Michael Madsen as Mr Blonde, Tim Roth as Mr Orange, Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink, Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie. They all give Startling Performances. Madson creates one of Cinemas Greatest Psychopaths, Cool, Calculating and Crazy.<p>The Story is obviously Simplistic, and has been done to death over the years, but Quentin makes it, and the whole genre, Utterly Fresh, Real and Unbelievably Entertaining. <p>Quentin's Writing and Directing seem to have Years of Experience behind them, while also having the freshness and youth of a Debut writer/director. What more can one say about this classic that millions of other fans haven't. If you've seen it, see it again, if you haven't, what have you been doing?</p></body></html>

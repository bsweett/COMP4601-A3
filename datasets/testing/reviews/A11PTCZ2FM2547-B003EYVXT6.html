<meta name="summary" content="Mutant:  It's What's For Dinner"></head><body><p>Oh, those pesky outside-the-box scientists.  Give them a chance and they'll cut, splice, and dice DNA combos until they wind up with something that looks like Lady Gaga's meat costume--yet it can do your taxes.  And ethics?  Ethics schmethics.  We've got deadly diseases to cure!  Where's that test tube that had the ostrich bullion amino acids?  Over there, next to the cornish hen hamster.<br /><br />Thus we establish the premise of SPLICE, an out-of-control belly wobbler about a pair of geneticists who create first two globs of liver spot punching bags, then add human DNA to this mix and create. . .well, something between what you find in a bucket of KFC and what you slip a dollar bill to at the strip pole.  As we all know, the mutant is going to run amuck and cause massive carnage, and that our two scientists (Adrien Brody, who needs a meal, and Sarah Polley, who needs a valium) are going to face ethical and moral dilemmas that will challenge the foundation of whatever the nature of their relationship is.  Delphine Chaneac plays Dren, the creature, and when she's not sprouting wings or flicking a poison-tipped tail she's making noises akin to my accountant after a bottle of Wellers.  Sure turn-ons for Brody--that naughty scientist.<br /><br />We even come across a Brody clone in Brandon McGibbon, who plays Brody's brother, so SPLICE is actually Adrien Brody squared, which should be scary, but like everything else in this howler it's not.  I don't know why I give two stars to a horror movie I enjoyed so much it made me laugh all the way through; maybe it was the liver spot punching bags.  Call PETA.<br />--D.

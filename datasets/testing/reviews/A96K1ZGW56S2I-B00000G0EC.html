It's also one of only a handful of movies ever made based on a novel that was already in preproduction before the novel ever was released.  It's also one of the first movies to use CGI in significant scenes throughout the film.  It's also the movie that gave Sam Neill a break and reinvigorated the career of Jeff Goldblum.  The movie (promoted by the release of the novel about a year earlier) got the general public (and not just kids) excited about dinosaurs again and did to paleontology as a major what RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK did to archaeology.<br /><br />The premise, seeped in pop science, is that a multi-billionaire, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) brings dinosaurs back to life by cloning the dino-DNA taken from mosquitoes trapped in amber.  He builds a zoological theme-park he calls Jurassic Park.  However, in order to call off a bunch of lawyers after an accident with one of the park's workers, Hammond has to get a group of scientific experts to endorse that the park is safe and viable.  Thus, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) arrive to tour the facilities.  Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello), are also along for the ride as test subjects.  Due to a hurricane and the shenanigans of a greedy employee, the park experiences a major breakdown and the dinosaurs get loose.<br /><br />JURASSIC PARK set records upon its initial release in 1993 and it isn't difficult to see why.  The CGI effects that have become common in just about every movie since then were in their infancy then, yet the creatures appear completely lifelike.  Of course, Spielberg not only used CGI but he had some live action dinos and models involved as well.  It was a massive undertaking, but one that had a huge payoff.<br /><br />There's not much to complain about with JURASSIC PARK.  Sam Neill is great as Dr. Grant (the role was originally offered to Harrison Ford and I'm actually glad he turned it down) and Jeff Goldblum is almost always a delight to watch on screen.  After 15 years of directing his own movies, Richard Attenborough came back for the perfect part as John Hammond.  The action sequences in the film are still as exciting to watch as they were when the film first was in theatres.  The movie is classic Spielberg and those are some of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />This DVD includes a very informative documentary about the making of JURASSIC PARK, some clips from an early production meeting (it's probably the closest an average person can come to meeting the real Spielberg), some storyboards and other illustrations, Phil Tippett's Animatic of the "Raptors in the Kitchen" sequence showing the raptors as they were originally conceived with having lizard-like tongues, trailers for all three JURASSIC PARK movies, a dinosaur encyclopedia featuring the dinosaurs seen in the movie, some production notes, and a list and partial filmography of the cast & crew.</p></body></html>

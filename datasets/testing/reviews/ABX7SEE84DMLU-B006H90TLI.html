Note the cinematography, showing Dodge Ram and Ford Granada hood ornaments lovingly and prominently.  And then we have our protagonist...<br /><br />Anton's m'name, and fate's m'game.<br /><br />Ya gotta love a guy who loves his work like this.  The obsessive assassin in this wonderful (if not heartwarming) film is named Anton Chigurh.<br /><br />Characters have a hard time pronouncing it.  Some have it rhyming with "sugar."  It looks like it should sound like "chigger" and, to be honest, that would make a lot more sense.  Like chigger bites.<br /><br />The Coens lavish so much attention on acts of violence and their aftermath.  But, as one character says, Anton has his principles - this is not about violence serving cheap avarice.  Anton is an agent and servant of fate.  His particular insanity transcends greed (unlike the bad guys in Fargo).<br /><br />Anton's purpose for existence is to kill.  If he was former Special Ops, he fulfilled his existential position there.  Too bad he was honorably discharged.  Without commanders to direct his killing competency, he must somehow direct himself.  And it's a job he embraces and enjoys.<br /><br />I just love the last scene he's in - random fate deals him a low card, but it has absolutely nothing to do with justice at all.<br /><br />To quote from Sam Spade's "Flitcraft" narrative in "The Maltese Falcon," it's as though someone lifted the lid from life and let us look at the works.  Life is filled with randomness.  It is also malevolent, replete with loss and people who are fulfilled by destruction and killing.  Anton's greatest resonance is that, honestly, there's a little bit of Anton in everyone.<br /><br />But we're the sheriff's dad, too.  You didn't like the ending?  Jump back one index mark on the DVD and listen more closely.  Then call it.</p></body></html>

This film was filmed by Les Blank, not Werner Herzog. Burden of Dreams is positively fascinating, and Werner Herzog is a compelling presence who you simply must love. He filmed Fitzcarroldo in the Amazon jungle for over five years, and the story of how he did it is gripping. Bonus material involves him eating his shoes, looking back at all this 20 years later, and some other cool stuff. Get this one. Do it now.</p></body></html>

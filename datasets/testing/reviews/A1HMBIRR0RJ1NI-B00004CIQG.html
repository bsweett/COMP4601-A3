Still holds up fantastic today! Got to love the nuclear bomb riding Slim Pickens! What a classic scene!<br /><br /> Peter Sellers is at his best portraying three very different characters! His Dr. Strangelove has to go down as a comedic performance of the 20th century! A true masterpiece!<br /><br />Communism will never be the same! Neither will Capitalism!<br /><br />"No fighting in the war room!" LOL!</p></body></html>

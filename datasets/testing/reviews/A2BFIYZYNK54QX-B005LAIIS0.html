<meta name="summary" content="Thoughtful yet predictable with just enough drama to keep you watching."></head><body><p>Director Joe Carnahan made such a promising and exciting start in the feature film business with the 70's crime drama throwback NARC. It was strong, exciting and a shot in the arm to a tiring genre. He followed that up with the bizarre yet oddly entertaining ensemble actioner SMOKING ACES, but once locked into the Hollywood machine, he did the unnecessary but not-too-terrible film version of the 80's TV show THE A-TEAM, which teamed him for the first time with strong dramatic actor who became rebranded as action star Liam Neeson. This somehow led to THE GREY, a film that is not the survival adventure promised in the previews. THE GREY is an occasionally thoughtful, extremely existental, and ultimately predictible Man Versus Nature drama.<br /><br />We have John Ottway (Neeson, finally being allowed to speak in his natural accent), a gruff and suicidally depressed "exterminator" of sorts who works on an oil-drilling site in Alaska. His job essentially consists of picking off nasty man-eating wolves that look to use the workers as kibble with his rifle. He ponders poetically about his wife and how he misses her and how he knows he'll never be with her again. The other workers are, for the most part, societal outcasts; they're ex-cons, drifters, quick to anger and violence, meaning that Ottway is right at home with them. But it's time for them to go home, so they catch a plane back to Anchorage. There are warnings of a storm, or as co-writers Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (who wrote the short story this film is based on) call it, foreshadowing. The plane naturally crashes (in an uncomfortably effective set piece) and Ottway finds himself taking charge of a ragged and motley crew of survivors and look to stay alive amongst the harsh weather of the Alaska's snowy wastelands. Before too long, it seems that Ottway's work has followed him to the crash site as they soon find themselves surrounded by a pack of vicious ravening wolves. So instead of this being a story about men coming together and fighting the elements, it becomes something of a horror film as the men begin getting picked off one by one as Ottway tries to lead them to safety.<br /><br />Despite the film's massive leaps of logic and sense in order to manufacture forward momentum, it's an interesting film to watch. Carnahan does a commendable job of showing the brutal and unforgiving climate and also shows some beautiful vistas of the Alaskan wilderness. He's also pretty good at creating suspense, but it's really just enough to keep you watching despite knowing just about everything that's going to happen. You know that the film will become allegorical at one point for the behavior of the animals and the behavior of the men. You know there will be someone that will eventually challenge Ottway's "alpha" status, and that comes in the form of Diaz (the most interesting character of the film as played by a very volatile Frank Grillo, a great character actor). The whole cast of survivors, including Dallas Roberts and a very unrecognizable Dermot Mulroney, essentially seem to be analogues of the cast of John Carpenter's arctic existential horror masterpiece THE THING, but even that's not a terribly new idea. Survival thrillers often have the same archetypal characters. The film also delves into the nature of humanity's faith and the existence of a higher power, and this is where the film succeeds at being surprising yet unnecessarily ham-fisted as it becomes the love-child of Jack London and Samuel Beckett by way of Carnahan's profanity-and-gore-laden narrative. Neeson does nice work here and it further cements his current bad-ass status, but this is not even as interesting or as memorable of a role as Bryan Mills in TAKEN.<br /><br />Where I think the biggest disconnect is between audiences and this film is, exists in the realm of its marketing. This film promises certain things in the trailers and the commercials but doesn't live up to them, and the most glaring example of that is in the film's climax which is the very end of the film. While the moment promised to us is hardly the point of the film, it's something that everyone wanted to see, and when that was taken away from us, we felt cheated. There's truth to that. Most of the negative reviews specifically have to do with the film's ending and how it didn't live up to some very specific expectations, and that's more to do with the marketing than the film, because this is a film where the narrative isn't dependent on a climactic showdown between Ottway and the wolves; it's a more contemplative film than that. So I just don't think that we can blame Carnahan for the ending not meeting those expectations; Universal wanted to get butts in seats and what better way to do that with a film like this than the promise of Liam Neeson taping broken glass to his fists to do battle with a wolf?<br /><br />One way or the other, the biggest problem with THE GREY is that it attempts to be a thought-provoking piece of the existental crisis of Man Versus Nature, but because it's more structured like a survival horror film, it ends up not being terribly successful in either way.<br /><br />3/5 Stars.</p></body></html>

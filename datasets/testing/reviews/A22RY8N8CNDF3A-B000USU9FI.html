<meta name="summary" content="Political Thriller -"></head><body><p>"The Manchurian Candidate" is a remake of the 1962 political thriller.  This time, Captain Bennett Marco is played by Denzel Washington.  The movie kept reminding me of the new dream thriller "Inception" where planting ideas in the brain by invading one's dreams or subconscious.  The Manchurian Candidate had the same thesis of planting thoughts and erasing how they got there.<br /><br />This newer version of "The Manchurian Candidate" focuses on soldiers from the Iraq War as the test subjects.  Capt. Bennett and Sgt Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) are taken captive during the first Iraq invasion, The Gulf War, and brainwashed to rebel once they return home.  Ten years later, Shaw's mother (Meryl Streep) is determined that her son become president, and pressures the Convention to get him on the ticket as vice president nominee.  She gets her way and we soon realize this is just the first step.  Shaw's mother has taken over Shaw's life.<br /><br />As Marco begins to unravel the brainwashing, he does Internet searches and soon remembers the geneticist that plants ideas.  Not only has he found a microchip in his back and Shaw's, ideas are planted deep inside the brain.  Soon it becomes a race to beat the brainwashing plot.<br /><br />This film holds your attention as this political thrills to the amazing climax.  I think it is better than the 1962 version.</p></body></html>

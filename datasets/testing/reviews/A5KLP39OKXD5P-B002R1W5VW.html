The film starts slow but then takes on a brilliant flow, from the beginning itself, you are easily glued to the screen, totally engaged in the characters, specially 'Roy' played brilliantly by Nicholas Cage, 'Roy' is a person who will communicate to you with just his eyes and facial expressions and Cage effortlessly breathes enough life into the character, making this one of his best performances without a doubt and it is actually 'Roy' you are witnessing and not the actor Nicholas Cage. Surprisingly brilliant performance from Alison Lohman who plays 'Angela'. The chemistry between Cage and Lohman are just enough to get you involved in the whole scenario of the film. A similarly good performance from Sam Rockwell as well. 'Matchstick men' will surely draw you to its situations, the moods and mostly its characters. A tiny little gem of a film, not to be missed.</p></body></html>

I happened to love all the costumes, the locales where the film was shot as well as the Danny Elfman score which manages to add a lot more weight to the film, which suffers from the original paltry concept and some noxious re-imaginings found in this new revision.<br /><br />  I simply fail to understand why people are drawn to the whole Wolfman concept in the first place. It has little basis in reality unless you're drawn to those stories of humans raised by apes in the jungle who are unable to throw off their primitive inclinations due to their unusual upbringing. Of course in those rare cases, the human being doesn't find himself transformed into a beast and then reverting to human form, whenever daylight finally breaks.<br /><br />  As a myth, the Wolfman seems awfully simplistic. What does one learn after undergoing the 'Wolfman' experience in the movies? That men are capable of horrible violence when the thin veneer of civilization is swept away? So what!<br /><br />  In a sense, the Wolfman character is a paganistic, pre-Christian representative of the Devil. Where the Devil is a beast in human form, the Wolfman is a human in a fake, beast-like form. Those viewers with unconscious aggressive wishes are vicariously drawn in part to the fake beast, who with his superhuman strength, rips peoples' heads off with a flick of his paw-like hand. Not only do they take delight in a character that can best be found conjured up in a five-year-old's nightmare, but also cheer just as loudly, when the fake creature meets its end at the hands of a superstitious, vengeful mob. The mob finally figures out a way to snuff out the life of this maniacal figure, who somehow emanates from a dream-like world. It's much more difficult coming to terms with devils such as the Nazis, whose evil had a human face and were not so easily defeated as the Wolfman is here.<br /><br />  'The Wolfman' (the remake) changes the plot of the original 1941 film by introducing the idea that the Wolfman's father, Sir John Talbot, is actually a Wolfman himself and is responsible for the death of his son, Ben Talbot. Lawrence Talbot, now an American actor (having left England after the death of mother), initially returns to the family estate to investigate the disappearance of his brother, but soon learns that the brother has been murdered. Later, it's revealed that Sir John's faithful servant, Singh, has been keeping him locked up for years in the castle whenever the full moon appears, preventing the father from escaping and fomenting havoc throughout the countryside.<br /><br />  The problem is that Sir John is an utterly, unlikable character who's depicted as not having one modicum of charm. He's such a churl that he doesn't hesitate in informing Lawrence that he's responsible for murdering his mother, his brother and also turning Lawrence into a werewolf as well. Instead of sticking up for the son (who's being hunted by a determined Scotland Yard Inspector as well as assorted meanies from the town), Sir John would rather (pardon the pun), throw his son to the wolves!<br /><br />  Lawrence as the Wolfman has a similar problem. Unlike the Frankenstein monster or a modern version such as Terminator II, he's not what you would call, a 'conflicted' creature. The good side never comes out until maybe the end, when he realizes that it's Gwen (the woman who falls for both Ben and Lawrence), who he's about to rip apart, turning her into the expected umpteenth bloody mess. While Lawrence terrorizes both urban and rural parts of England, he's simply a killing machine, ripping all kinds of body parts from living human beings. All this becomes tiresome since we're praying that perhaps his human side might emerge and the Inspector will now have reasons in hesitating to do the creature in.<br /><br />  Was anyone else bothered by the fact that the The Wolfman's demise is a foregone conclusion? I found it deflating that Maleva, the gypsy woman, informs Gwen that there's no cure for the Wolfman's curse. The best we can look forward to is that the Wolfman dies in the presence of someone who loves him. Once all that is brought out, the climax is utterly predictable and one realizes that 'The Wolfman' is a film with virtually no surprises.<br /><br />  'The Wolfman' could have been a much more interesting film if it had some stakes (pardon the pun again), that you could bite your teeth into! How about a satire or critique on the Victorian age--the era in which the film is set in? In the end, 'The Wolfman' is all atmosphere. One must be content with admiring the attention to detail--yes, dig those illustrations on the front page of the newspaper that chronicles "the monster's" deeds, that the Inspector thrusts in Gwen's face when he visits her antique store! Very cool! As for the Wolfman story--unfortunately, that's something that's not very hard to forget, in a virtual instant.</p></body></html>

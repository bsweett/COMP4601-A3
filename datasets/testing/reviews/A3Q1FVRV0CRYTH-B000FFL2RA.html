<meta name="summary" content="Blew Alexander away, but comes no where near Gladiator or Troy!"></head><body><p>This movie, unduly BASHED by critics, was not half bad.  I enjoyed the storyline, and the acting as a whole was decent.  The battle scenes as well as the scenery itself was breathtaking and even rivaled those in Troy.  I have to say, to me the strongest charactor was Marton Csokas who played husband to Eva Green (who also did a great job with what she had to work with) and subsiquential heir to the throne.  Orlando Bloom who I will say is a fine actor handled his role well, or as well as can be expected.  Although I feel that Colin Farrell did a far better job in Alexander (my opinion) I was surprised to see him buff out for his role here.  He's got nothing on Crowe, Bana or Pitt for that matter but he did decent.  Edward Norton as the leper king was a treat...he's a great actor who can tackle anything spendidly.  It's a story to be told and thats a great thing.  I love epic pictures and this is one I will watch again and one that I am happy was made.  It's not like it couldn't have been better, but the point is that it's still really well done.  Just because he's no Crowe doesn't mean he's not good.</p></body></html>

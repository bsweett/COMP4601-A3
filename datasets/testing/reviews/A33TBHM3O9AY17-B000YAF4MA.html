Although they didn't live up to some of their earlier great roles, neither were they disappointing.  Both did yeoman's work in their roles as aging men from very different life backgrounds, one phenomenally rich and the other a humble laborer, who found common ground in their battle with terminal cancer.  Both are forced, without regard to wealth or social status, to come to grips with both their own mortality and their past failings.<br /><br />The first half hour or so of the movie was less than gripping, and at times maybe even a little tedious, but once it moves into the meat of the storyline it takes on a new life (although even at this it seems a bit too contrived and just missed a fourth star).  In their quest to live full lives in their last remaining months, and thus to try to undo a lifetime of squandered opportunities, they stumble upon something far more valuable -- true self-understanding, true friendship, and, most importantly, redemption.<br /><br />I hate spoilers, so I won't give any clues except to say that the end of this frequently humorous, frequently poignant tale is delightfully unexpected and equally poetic.  This is not a great movie, but I would characterize it as a good one that will, or at least should, prompt each viewer to stop and think about his or her own approach to life, and to pursue the most important things while there's still time.</p></body></html>

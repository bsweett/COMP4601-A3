<meta name="summary" content="Great Film; Great DVD"></head><body><p>Loved the Film, Loved the Sound, Loved the DVD.<br /><br />I got the Version from Best Buy ( Which has an extra that supposedly no place else has), the extra being a booklet of decent quality.<br /><br />Anyway, the leading Lady is superb.<br /><br />I chose the version which is the extended edition ( I have no idea if this an unrated or an R rated  version),  and I totally  enjoyed myself; the sound just worked brilliantly in 5.1<br /><br />This is layered with Mythology, and works on so many levels. The scope for expanding the franchise works well in this adaptation of the two myths.<br /><br />Lance Henrikson's performance is just great. And contrary to some people's  comments, the other characters are quite good, and very relatable; but for obvious plot reasons a few of them are 2 dimensional  characters, since they are there to bounce comments off, and only a few characters are developed  enough to be considered 3 dimensional.<br /><br />Great fun, excellent  addition to the mythos.</p></body></html>

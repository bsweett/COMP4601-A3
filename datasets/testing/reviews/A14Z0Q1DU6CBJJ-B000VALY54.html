<meta name="summary" content="ROBERT DOWNEY JR!!  Please keep on the right track... You're a PHENOMINAL TALENT"></head><body><p>I wouldn't normally dish out 5 stars unless something was a classic or an Oscar winner in my opinion. Yet, the last few years have been dismal when it comes to making memorable, unique, quality films that will stand the test of time, and KISS KISS, BANG BANG was one of the most satisfying and entertaining films I've seen in a LONG LONG LONG TIME.<br /><br />Sharp. Crisp. Creative. Great screenplay. Unique. Different. Characters you can get behind and feel for. Personalities that capture your interest. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is a stylish, fast paced, in your face, suspensful, violent, funny, modern, slice of film noir.<br /><br />You can tell that SOMEBODY took their time with this one. Made sure they had a tight, solid and flawless script. Unlike most movies these days that are slopped together to beat deadlines, KISS KISS, BANG BANG made the rarely done these days decision to make sure they had it all covered before finishing.<br /><br />All that being said, the real quality of KISS KISS, BANG BANG comes from its stars... and I do mean STARS. Too many actors and actress are showing up these days who's only talent is being rich and related to someone who's good. It's nice to be reminded who the real stars are.<br /><br />Michelle Monaghan is a charming and shining delight throughout the film. From the moment she curled up to the detective novel she finds at a Hollywood party to going after the bad guys in her Santa Claus costume with gun in hand, she wins you over and proves she's gonna be a BIG BIG star.<br /><br />VAL KILMER is always an underrated talent and one of my favorites. He's been robbed of an Oscar twice (Tombstone & the Doors), and he's been shunned in some circles, but Val has always been unique and takes chances. No matter what movie he does, you never look at him as... "that's Val Kilmer", he becomes his characters, like Doc Holliday, like Jim Morrison & like the brash, not-a-nice-guy, gay Perry in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.<br /><br />And Finally, Robert Downey Jr. Please Robert... keep making movies. Don't ever get sidetracked again, and don't ever forget how stickin' good you are. I don't know if his dialogue is scripted or if he is improvising from time to time, but Downey Jr. is ALWAYS in KISS KISS saying something witty, interesting or just making you think. He proves in this movie how good HE IS and ALWAYS has been.<br /><br />KISS KISS, BANG BANG is a fast moving creative minded joy and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies like I do.<br /><br />I only have one question???  So, seeing as though, this has very very few special features... a gag reel, that's it, when is the special edition DVD coming out? and is it pointless to buy this one now? Stinkin' greedy hollywood. Don't they make enough money already?</p></body></html>

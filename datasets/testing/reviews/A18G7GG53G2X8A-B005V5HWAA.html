For cardboard tycoon Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner), there's a duality between his everyday life and his secret life as the Thumbprint Killer: the former is picture perfect, a wealthy man with a loving wife and daughter; the latter is an unfeeling monster who readily admits that he's addicted to murdering. I initially thought that I was supposed to choose a version of this man to root for. I eventually came to the realization that making this choice would be pointless. I say this because this story is not meant to instill sympathy or even hatred; it merely wants to show Mr. Brooks for who he is, in both good and bad ways. This is very appropriate because, when you get right down to it, there's very little about this man to emotionally invest in.<br /><br />The biggest duality is between Brooks' rational state of mind and his deep-seeded, animalistic urges. His murderous tendencies very cleverly manifest themselves as a man named Marshall (William Hurt), who can only be seen and heard by Brooks. Marshall acts as a driving force, temping Brooks simply because murdering is so much fun. The dynamic between these two characters is incredibly unique, especially since one is nothing more than the other's subconscious mind. In a sense, Marshall is the true serial killer; Brooks is merely a tool, a physical means to commit murder. It's obvious that, at times, Brooks is purposely not trying hard enough to control Marshall--taking a life is just so intoxicating.<br /><br />At other times, Brooks genuinely tries like hell to fight against his urges; on some level, he knows that what he's doing is wrong. At the film's start, we learn that he had managed to avoid temptation for two years, and by then, the possibility of relapsing seemed remote. But then he learns of a young couple attending a dance school, and the urge proves too strong to fight off. With the extreme precision of a master calculator, he's able to break into their apartment and shoot them as they make love. As an extra thrill, he poses their bodies and photographs them. His final touch--his trademark--is to press each victim's thumb into a bloodstain, leaving behind a print.<br /><br />If only Brooks had noticed that the couple left their bedroom drapes open. His carelessness comes back to haunt him in the form of a young voyeur only known as Mr. Smith (Dane Cook). He presents Brooks with incriminating photos; the couple's apartment complex is within range of Smith's camera, and apparently, he had been photographing them for months (they always had sex with their drapes open). But Smith is not interested in turning Brooks in; rather, he wants to join Brooks during his next murder spree. There's a restrained intensity to this character that I really liked, suggestive of an immature teenager desperate to prove himself when he's clearly not ready. Cook played this character brilliantly, giving him just the right mix of arrogance, anger, and naivety. Brooks does agree to Smith's terms, but not before discussing the situation with Marshall. Let's just say that everyone here has a few hidden agendas.<br /><br />All this paves the way for some interesting scenes of victim hunting. At one point, Brooks describes the process as something similar to falling in love: you come across many people, but only a select few have the ability to make your heart pound with excitement. I must admit, I've never heard it put that way before. I must also admit, I loved it; there's a definite charm to this character that shines through despite the fact that he's a sociopath. This doesn't make him a likeable character by any means, but it certainly makes him a bit more compelling. One wonders if he's capable of feeling any emotion, especially when it comes to his family. Without giving too much away, a subplot involving his college-age daughter (Danielle Panabaker) leads him to question certain things; even after moments of reflection, his feelings remain unclear.<br /><br />Hot on the Thumbprint Killer's trail is Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), who's involved in her own subplots: one is about a bitter divorce; the other is about an escaped criminal threatening to track her down. When Brooks is made aware of her, he finds her more fascinating than problematic (the same can't be said for Marshall). Her father is a wealthy businessman, and because of that, she's worth millions. But instead of following in his footsteps, she decided to be a cop. Why is this? Indeed, she is a fascinating character, someone so fragile despite her tough-as-nails appearance. Again, duality comes into play, an ingredient that prevents the film from becoming a run of the mill psychological thriller. Ultimately, every ingredient of "Mr. Brooks" makes for one the most well crafted film of the year.</p></body></html>

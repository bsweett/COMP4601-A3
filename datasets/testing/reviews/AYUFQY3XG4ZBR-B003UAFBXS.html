<meta name="summary" content="Don Coscarelli does it again"></head><body><p>Some 25 years ago a no-name director wrote, produced, edited, correographed, and of course directed a surprise sleeper horror movie success that eventually spawned its own franchise of sequels, "Phantasm".  I've given that movie a thorough review elsewhere, so we won't dwell much on it here...but it did prove that a full generation before "The Rebel Without A Script" (Robert Rodriguez) burst upon the scene, that it was possible to create a successful motion picture with very little money if you had a good story to tell.<br /><br />Years later we know that director as Don Coscarelli, since successful with both the "Phantasm" and "Bestmaster" franchises under his belt.  And today he still proves that an independent production at the grass roots level can succeed as long as the story has a hook.<br /><br />And "Bubba Ho-Tep" has more hooks than an East Texas bass fishin' tournament, baby.  I was happy to watch this movie and review it on the day that Elvis is alleged to have died (16 August); I can see it becoming an annual tradition for me now.  On the surface it is about two retirement home residents who may or may not have all of their faculties about them.  One (played by the Cary Grant of Cult Films, Bruce Campbell) believes he is actually Elvis Presley, stuck in limbo after an attempt to escape his own fame led to his switching places with an Elvis Impersonator who ended up dying in his place.  The other (played by the legendary Ossie Davis...wonderfully out-of-phase here) believes himself to be JFK, waylaid either by Lyndon Johnson, Fidel Castro, or possibly the Mafia.<br /><br />Perhaps as content as they can be living their last days in a semi-vegetative state, they become aware that an other-worldly force with its origins in an ancient Egyptian tomb is using their rest home as a means to feed on the souls of the living so that he may continue his own existence between the planes of life and death.  With nothing better to do, they decide it's up to them to stop him...to stop Bubba Ho-Tep.<br /><br />The movie is of course as campy and schlocky as you could possibly imagine.  Some of the special effects are particularly questionable (the scarab that does battle with Campbell's character seems a nod toward Coscarelli's previous insectoid creature that terrorized the heros in "Phantasm" all those years ago), and there is no way that anyone could under any circumstance take this as a serious film at any level.  But upon closer examination, there is a powerful sense of melancholy associated with the film, particularly in Campbell's superb voiceovers.  Not only does he do a very passable Elvis impersonation, but he proves himself to be an actor of very poignant capabilities, something that anyone who dismissed him after "Army Of Darkness" would never suspect.<br /><br />The underlying sadness to this film is inescapable; the autumn years of so many in our society are lonely and depressing as we are left to rot away (figuratively and literally in the case of "Elvis's", uh, member) in exile, alienated from the families we once led before becoming an embarrassing burden.  There are plenty of moments that lighten up the film, but the presence of Bubba Ho-Tep is strictly metaphorical; by falling from society's relevance we lose our souls if not from our own choosing and doing than by society's cold disenfranchising of us once we're deemed too old to be of value.<br /><br />It is probably one of the finest cult films of all time, not only for its complete off-the-wall plot and performances, but also for its social relevance regarding the plight of our senior citzens.  And the DVD is particularly loaded with all the bells and whistles a film buff could want...the commentary tracks, background information on the movie, trailer, and Coscarelli was good enough to direct and include a music video for the score, as well.  It's a good recommendation for people who fancy truly bizarre films that fit into multiple categories...for Elvis cultists (and we know who we are), it's yet another "possibility" to warm the hearts of those who still question whether he is really dead.  For horror movie buffs it's a good throwback to the days of hand-made features, and for someone who's looking for an excuse to tell their friends "I've just seen the weirdest movie EVER", this one really takes care of business, baby.</p></body></html>

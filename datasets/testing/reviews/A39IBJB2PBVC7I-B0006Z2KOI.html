Like JFK and Duane Allman, Che Guevara died at the ideal time to put a halo around his reputation.  Revolution was in the air, it was 1967, and young Americans were casting about for new role models because their old ones were - in a word - hideous.  Magically the face of Che became ubiquitous, he was - in an intellectually lazy way - symbolic of brave revolution in the face of tyranny.  That the truth of his legacy is almost the antithesis of those ideals was not important then, he was a T-shirt!<br /><br />The filmmakers cleverly tapped this ludicrous and sentimental vein, much the way the makers of Ray did, but the extra juice of self-righteous liberal elitism makes the mixture that much more intoxicating.  Add to that the outrageous good looks of the lead, Gael Garcia Bernal, and you have a budding thug and executioner you'd gladly introduce to mom and dad.  The film's most interesting and charismatic character dies halfway through the film - I'm referring of course to the 1939 Norton motorcycle after which the movie is named.<br /><br />The star of the film, and its much-needed redeeming factor, is the countryside of South America.  Viewers will be happiest when the land is simply allowed to do the talking, and the protagonists watch along with them.  In those moments when we are invited to imagine what an 8,000-mile journey through such a land must have felt like, we connect.  We do not connect through the dialogue.  For a couple of revolutionaries-in-training, these guys rarely - if ever - say anything that informs character, much less indicates change.  One can certainly understand how witnessing injustice could shape a vague desire to improve the world through direct action, but such a transformation is difficult to express on film - and you won't see it here.<br /><br />A movie deconstructing the hippie-era mythology about Che and revealing him for the closed-minded brute he was would have been much more interesting - although not as pretty.</p></body></html>

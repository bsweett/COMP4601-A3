I can see why it is a cult favorite. Part of a trilogy I think they got better as actor Bruce Campbell and Director Sam Raimi felt comfortable with this theme and took it further and further. By the time they got to "Army of Darkness" it became mostly comedy with some horror. AOD is my favorite of the three because of the outrageous bits and great special effects. This is a great collection for fans of horror/comedy movies. If you enjoyed this catch "Scary Movie".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

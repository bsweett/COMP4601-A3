<meta name="summary" content="Action packed, but a Superhero?"></head><body><p>The Punisher begins with the killing of Howard Saint's son in the last undercover mission of Frank Castle before his retirement. The Punisher develops from an all to common theme of revenge. Frank Castle seeks revenge for the life of his wife and son taken brutally by Howard Saint's (John Travolta) henchmen.  Frank then becomes the Punisher.<br /><br />  I have never read the comic book or even heard of the Punisher before this movie was made. I seen John Travolta's name on the one-sheet, so I rented the DVD. The movie is based on a Marvel Comic superhero. Does the Punisher have any super powers? I could not tell from this movie.<br /><br />  The Punisher is action packed with graphic violence. (Reason I wanted to see!) I think some of the action scenes were just too unbelievable. Note: The pickup truck with the thugs riding in the back while jumping the sand dunes Baja style. How can you stay inside the pickup without flying in the air like you were on a trampoline?  Even if you were strapped in, the injuries would be substantial from being tossed around like a rag doll. Maybe I'm looking to closely at this comic strip superhero movie. Is the superhero character the reason why we should see this movie?<br /><br />  And last but not least, who could resist the advances of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos's character? That is the most unbelievable thing in this movie. Hot, sexy and burned by former lovers. The Punisher must be a superhero or a comic strip character to resist. Maybe that's his super power!  Resistance of all emotion and caring for anyone; The Punisher!<br /><br />I would recommend seeing the X-men and X2 X-men United movies on how to translate comic superheroes to the big screen.</p></body></html>

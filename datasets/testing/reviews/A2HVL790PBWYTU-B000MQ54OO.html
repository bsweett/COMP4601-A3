I had such a good time with this film! HAPPY FEET is breathtaking and, like the best of animated films, successfully marries a sense of fun, cuteness, and charm, guaranteed to enchant the young, with a more sophisticated, darker layer which will satisfy the young-at-heart and maybe even make them reflect a bit. HAPPY FEET is an effective fusion of music, humor, and poignancy. It's part coming-of-age story, part heroic quest, and part commentary on staid, rigidly structured societies. And it is all musical. Most will be familiar with the finger-snapping, head-bobbing tunes, including the classic chorus from "The Message." Robin Williams ("My Way"), Brittany Murphy ("Somebody to Love" & "Boogie Wonderland"), Nicole Kidman ("Kiss"), and Hugh Jackman ("Heartbreak Hotel") offer up their own song renditions. Whether they do their musical numbers justice is wholly up to the viewer's discretion. Meanwhile, Mumble's tap dancing is gloriously brought to life on screen, thanks to the motion-capture work done by heralded tap dancer Savion Glover.<br /><br />Be cautioned that this film isn't quite in the same happy-go-lucky vein as the recent CARS, OVER THE HEDGE, THE WILD, and FLUSHED AWAY. Yes, the humor is there, as well as the familiar family-oriented sensibilities, but Director George Miller injects HAPPY FEET with more depth than normally found in animation (THE INCREDIBLES aside). This film has pretty dark sequences and several legitimate "boo!" moments, as the key characters are occasionally placed in harrowing danger, which might elicit a frightened gasp or an "Oh, no!" from the young 'uns. The vast, open, icy expanses of Antarctica lend an aura of grandeur and make the fairly solemn core storyline more credible. Now I'm not really a fan of message films - and HAPPY FEET's key plotline does hinge heavily on the penguins' environmental woes as caused by humans - but this film manages to weave its points seamlessly enough into the story, as opposed to heavy-handedly hammering it home.<br /><br />The plot: Maybe it's because he was dropped while still in his egg, but  Mumble (Elijah Wood), from the moment he hatched, has displayed a penchant for displaying happy feet, in the form of tap, an activity fiercely frowned upon by the penguin hierarchy as being quite undignified. To make it worse for Mumble, he can't sing a proper note, which is a severe dilemma. For without a heartsong, how will he find his  true love? From the get-go, Mumble becomes an outcast, an Emperor penguin forever toe-tapping on the fringes and treated with scorn by his peers. Even his father Memphis (Hugh Jackman) is embarassed of him and strives to make over Mumble into a more stately-shambling citizen. But there's a graver concern in the offing, which affects the entire penguin population: fish is getting harder to find. When the aged community patriarch Noah (Hugo Weaving) blames the scarcity of food on Mumble's unconventional tapping, which supposedly has angered the penguin deity, Mumble vows to seek the reason for the fish's disappearance and begins his odyssey. Initially accompanied by five wise-cracking, fun-loving Adelie penguins (with Mexican accents) who call themselves the Amigos and who think Mumble is accidentally cool, Mumble ultimately finds himself alone as he confronts the source of his community's fish depletion - us.<br /><br />The voice cast is perfectly good and doesn't get in the way of the pretty pictures. The ever-lively Robin Williams, who plays three characters here (Lovelace, Cletus, and the scene-stealing Ramon), is actually back to being funny. And, with CG animation that is drop-dead AMAZING and is guaranteed to make your jaw drop, HAPPY FEET is hands down the best animated film I've seen in years.</p></body></html>

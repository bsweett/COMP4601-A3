This is as tense a film as I've seen in some time.  The director, previously best known for rock videos, creates a sensational looking world that includes a megastore that looks very much like a "Super Target" store, a fabulous home for a financially successful young family, and the home of our main character, Sy Parrish, played by the Julliard-trained Mr. Williams.<br /><br />For almost 30 years I've felt that Williams is the funniest man alive, and that his few dramatic roles have been effective.  In this film, however, even though his presence looms large in almost every scene, he has taken it up a notch, totally and believably submerging any hint of humor.  We find Sy as an unstable control freak with no real life of his own, his entire world consisting of his TV, his subcompact car, and his job as a photo tech.  Consequently he infuses every detail of his pathetic world with a tremendous amount of importance, sweating the small stuff with such vigor that he reeks of the need to psychically rehydrate.<br /><br />One can see the moment coming when he snaps, and woe to the family in his way.<br /><br />This is not a violent film, but is phenomenally suspenseful in a Hitchcockian way.  There are two or three problems of logic with the plotting, unfortunately; one must believe, for example, that an unfaithful husband would allow his girlfriend to take a full roll of photos of them together kissing various parts of one another's upper anatomy (OK, so maybe he's just an idiot as well as a loser).  It's also a one-note film, focused in with tunnelvision on Sy and his unraveling.<br /><br />In any event, Williams carries off his role so well that ultimately the film works well, is very memorable and effective, and is certainly worth a rental at least.  Williams fans, those who love this type of film, and we who are intrigued with abnormal psychology, may well want to own a copy.</p></body></html>

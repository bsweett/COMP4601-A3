<meta name="summary" content="Up is a great film"></head><body><p>A very outstanding film featuring an unlikely hero who is old and offers us many lessons about love, life, loss and heroes having clay feet. Some of the best movies in the film industry are being made by Pixar. In my opinion the first fifteen minutes of his life were fantastic and actually brought a lump to my throat such was the power of this animated movie. Some of the scenes other than the first fifteen minutes stay with you, such as the house's final resting place after the balloons have snapped- simply superb.

<meta name="summary" content="CHILLING BUILD-UP TO A GROANER"></head><body><p>When family catastrophe hits them, they move -- father and daughter -- to a giant reclusive house in the middle of nowhere only to witness odd phenomena begin to occur.<br /><br />This of course involves creaky wooden floors, dusty old music boxes, winds blowing through windows suddenly ajar, defaced doll faces, and other devices of unfathomable suspense.<br /><br />The daughter shows acute symptoms of an imaginary friend who's behind it all, Charlie, but who really is he? Could be any one of a long list of (way too obvious) candidates, but one thing is certain: Charlie is very, very dangerous!<br /><br />This buildup is stale but fairly well played out, almost Night Shyamalanesqe in its use of visuals and sound.<br /><br />But then after having patiently humored the film for over an hour a bizarre and supremely idiotic climax is dropped on us. Apparently the wooden floors were not the only thing creaking.<br /><br />A lesson as good as any that a film's execution may be fabulous but a compelling script is still principal, and one twist, however whacky, can hardly make up for it.</p></body></html>

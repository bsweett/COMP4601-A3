<meta name="summary" content="A movie for all? Hm, maybe"></head><body><p>The only time I can remember a film deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar was when Return of the King won but that seemed more like a cumulative work than of the film itself (plus the fact it practically swept the whole night made it boring to watch). Ever since then we've had years where a film should've won or wasn't even nominated and we debate on whether the film is that good or if it was just a slow year. Crash is still a bad movie, most people forgot Chicago and Shakespeare in Love and I don't know anyone who watched the English Patient. No Country for Old Men, the latest winner, is a film where some say it was more than deserved while others thought it was well made but not the best but that's always the case huh?<br /><br />Texan Llewellyn Moss stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad, with one left alive and a bag with around 2 million in it. Against better reason, he returns to give the survivor water but people catch on and are hot on his tail. Notable is Anton Chigurh, a cunning and quite psychopathic man with a silencer-equipped shotgun, a cattle gun and a detachment to his kills and maybe even a bit of pleasure. Trying to save Moss and catch Chigurh is Sheriff Bell who's finding it more harder to be a sheriff when a lot of the old values have seemingly disappeared.<br /><br />Last year, Martin Scorsese's The Departed won the big prize which I felt was more like an award for his whole career rather than the film itself. With the Coen Brothers, they have had a wildly varied career from hits (Fargo, Big Lebowski) to failures (Ladykillers or the decent Intolerable Cruelty) so a lot of people can say No Country is most likely their finest since Fargo or Lebowski but strangely No Country didn't sit well on the second and third viewing. Not that it isn't a finely made film, remarkably restrained and not as showy, but I felt the film didn't improve when I saw it again even though most films do the more you see it.<br /><br />The 3 leads do super jobs playing their roles from 2007's big hitter Josh Brolin who had no less than 4 prominent roles, Tommy Lee Jones and the Award winning Javier Bardem. The latter of whom probably portrays the most evil and chilling villain in some time with intelligence yet a complete resolve to kill all in its way, it's certainly worth the nod as well as the win (though I'm sad Casey Affleck didn't get it for Jesse James). The rest of the cast has Woody Harrelson who is somewhat unneeded and Trainspotting's Kelly McDonald playing Moss' wife.<br /><br />Where the film might be an issue for some is in its ending which is quite unresolved and leaves quite a few questions unanswered and one scene involving a cat lover that I didn't like and it becomes one of those films that becomes well known because of what ending it was rather than how it fitted with the story, even though the book had the same thing. Not that it's a bad ending but it's one where it kind of nags in your mind for its emptiness rather than its emotional impact.<br /><br />Not being entirely familiar with their oeuvre, I'd recommend No Country but then again just because it won doesn't mean everyone will love it.</p></body></html>

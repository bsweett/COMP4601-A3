<meta name="summary" content="Violent yes but it blew me away!,"></head><body><p>I remember after watching Pulp Fiction, it became hard for me to find new films during those days that excited me. I mean "Pulp" was so unique and original that I was so stunned when I first watched it. I couldn't believe my eyes, it was funny, violent and it wasn't meaningless either because at the end of each story there is a message of redemption. Now it brings me to "Usual Suspects." I didn't really know what to expect when I first watched it because it looked like it was going to be some prison movie. But I was wrong. The plot just kept twisting and turning which kept me on the edge of my seat. It was suspenseful and mysterious, the whole bit with Keyser Soze, it's gold! And the ending is what made this movie. The film truly has THE BEST ENDING in any movie ever made. I'm not gonna ruin it for those who haven't seen it.<br /><br />So I desperately urge all of you who haven't seen it to go out to either rent it or buy it. Buying it is good because this one is a keeper; I have a copy of it myself. It's always fun to watch it with someone who hasn't seen it just to see their reaction. And of course, great performances on behalf of Kevin Spacey (who's career skyrocketed after his role as Verbal Kint) and Benicio Del Toro (whose talent was recognized after his useless role as Fenster where he basically took a guy who only had like two lines in the whole movie and actually was able to turn him into a character that people care about after watching it.</p></body></html>

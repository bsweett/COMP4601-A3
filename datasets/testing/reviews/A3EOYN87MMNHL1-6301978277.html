To see Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in drag is in itself, sweet, but the whole story is side-splitting.  Jack's and Tony's characters must dress as women and join a girls' band to escape being massacred by mobsters.  Marilyn is one of the band members and immediately starts getting very chummy with them, explaining all kinds of personal information under the category of "girl talk."  These two men are drooling over her and she is none the wiser. Then a wealthy elderly man (Joe E Brown) falls in love with one of the "girls" and his attempts to seduce "her" is hilarious. You must re-view this film every few years to have a "complete life."</p></body></html>

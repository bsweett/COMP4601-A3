<meta name="summary" content="THE FIRST GREAT SUPERHERO FILM"></head><body><p>Released in 1978, Superman would be the first big buget Hollywood treatment of Superheroes and thus is historically a very important film as it showed studios just how big movies like this could be.  Directed by Richard Donner the movie covers the origins of Superman from the destruction of his planet of krypton to being sent away prior to its destruction to Earth where he would be found by Mr. and Mrs Kent and raised as their own son, Clark.<br /><br />We see Clark as a young man coming to grips with his power, even showing off by racing a train.  With the death of his father (Glen Ford) we cut to an adult Clark going to Metropolis and getting a job with the Daily Planet and meeting Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) Perry White (Jackie Cooper) and eventually his arch-nemesis, lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).<br /><br />Long before the days of computer generated special effects, the geniuses behind Superman really did make us believe a man could fly.  His first appearance as Superman where he catches Lois Lane as she plummets to certain doom, and then catches the crashed helicopter still give me chills when I watch it.<br /><br />Of course the thing that most of us will remember about Superman is its star, the late Christopher Reeve.  The man truly embodied what Superman was.  His fantastic portrayal of the geeky, fumbling Clark contrasted perfectly with his powerful and definitive portrayal as the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Gene Hackman was comically evil as Lex Luthor and was joined by co-horts Ned beatty and Valerie perrine as the film's eye candy.<br /><br />Mario Puzo, known for his best work in the original story of The Godfather, put together a wonderful researched story staying true to the classic comic.  This special edition contains several added scenes not in the original theatrical release featuring several more scenes on Krypton invloving Brando.  The main things about this great DVD are the 3 documentaries hosted by Marc McLure who played Jimmy Olsen in the movies.  They give a fascinating look behind the making of these movies and the problems of casting and pulling off the special effects that they faced.  Also great is the screen tests which feature some of the other actresses who were considered for the part of Lois Lane and a great commentary track by Richard Donner.<br /><br />Really a wonderful and valuable DVD.  It's one I will always keep!  Hopefully we will see a special Edition of Superman 2.  One of the few sequels that were actually better than the original.</p></body></html>

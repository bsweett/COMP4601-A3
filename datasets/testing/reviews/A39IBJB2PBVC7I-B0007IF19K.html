That's because, whenever somebody stumbles over a format that works, everyone else keeps doing it over and over, milking it down to the last cent.<br /><br />The recent swell of bio-pics like Walk The Line and Capote can be traced in part to the immense and deserved popularity of Ray. The version I saw included extended "director's cut" scenes which could be viewed on demand. They are highly recommended. These scenes add depth and texture to personal demons that plagued Charles. Overall the movie is remarkably accurate and fair, and provides great insight into a larger than life genius and musical innovator.<br /><br />Ray's portrayal of the early days is particularly interesting, tiny clubs, being paid in ones, the splendid independence and confidence, so much the product of his mother's insistence he be prepared for blindness when it arrived. That the movie stops before wretched musical excesses of the late career is an all-around blessing. But here is the problem.<br /><br />Foxx did deserve the Oscar, especially for the way he recreated movement, mannerisms, and physical style. He made a newly dead Charles return to life in our minds. But was the Academy rewarding Foxx, or Charles? Ray Charles was a universally loved icon. All Foxx had to do was slip into his suit and immediately he became interesting, sympathetic, and talented - because he was Ray Charles. By achieving his re-creation goal so completely, Foxx drew attention away from the movie's failure, a complete lack of originality.<br /><br />The creative process involves delivering something that wasn't there before you arrived. The triumph of Ray, as good as it is, is that it delivers something that was already there, the personal and musical legacy of Ray Charles, and doesn't injure it too badly in the process. That Hollywood today relies so heavily on breathing life into recently deceased celebrities for its financial grist succinctly demonstrates its creative bankruptcy and cannibalistic tendencies.</p></body></html>

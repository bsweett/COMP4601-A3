While mining for diamonds under force of the Armed Forces, Vandu finds a 10-carat diamond, buries it, and is captured and thrown in prison. In the meantime, rebels attack the village where his family live kidnapping his son Dia in the process and turning him into a child soldier. Archer knows he found the diamond he's been looking for and makes a deal with Vandy that if he helps him find it, he will get his family back and split the amount between the both of them. He also makes a deal with Maddy that if she helps the two men get to their destination, she can write the story she's been longing for.<br /><br />Blood Diamond isn't the best film of the year, but it has good performances of the cast, especially Dicaprio and Hounsou who could end up with Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and an insight into a world of sadistic violence and treachery with an ending result of diamonds on people's fingers, which could turn people away from the traditional marriage proposals!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B-</p></body></html>

Soon after, he realizes he should do it and he signs himself up. After awhile he realizes he doesnt want to lose her so he tries, in his mind to hide her so she cant be erased. A bizarre and mind warping experience that is fun and emotional and everything else. Carrey gives probably so far the best performance of his career and Winslet is beautiful and simply a marvel...the other cast are amazing as well...Mark Ruffalo (Collateral, My Life Without Me, In The Cut) and Elijah Wood (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Ash Wednesday) play the mind eraser guys...Kirsten Dunst (Spider-man 1 and 2, Interview With The Vampire) plays the secretary to the doctor that was the creator of the erasing minds project, played by Tom Wilkinson (Rush Hour, The Patriot, In The Bedroom). It pulls you in from the beginning and then it brings you for a wild and unforgettable ride. Charlie Kaufman proves he is a genius when it comes to writing original and clever stories...he proved it with both Being John Malkovich and Adaptation and now he's done it again here. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a masterwork and will remain one in my mind. Also starring David Cross (Men In Black 1 and 2, Run Ronnie Run) and Jane Adams (Anniversary Party, Lemony Snickets). "Two Thumbs Way Way Up" for me</p></body></html>

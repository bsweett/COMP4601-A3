<meta name="summary" content="Strong performances, surprising twists"></head><body><p>Well worth seeing, more than the usual twists and turns, although I do have to say the ending may be hotly debated by viewers - good or bad? Even so, go see this one to see Tom Cruise departs from his usual &quot;good guy saves the world&quot; persona, playing a hit man who encounters an unwitting cabdriver and makes him part of his game plan.<br /><br /> A solid and riveting movie, with a bit of philosophy thrown in, just enough to keep things from being formulaic, as Cruise and the cabbie debate ethics. Try to see it in a theatre without too many people or distractions so you can give it your full concentrations - and don't buy too much soda. You're not going to want to miss a moment of this one, let alone for a restroom break.<br /><br /> Won't say more, this is one plot that doesn't deserve any spoilers.</p></body></html>

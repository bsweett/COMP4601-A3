<meta name="summary" content="Made-for-TV quality with little focus on 9/11"></head><body><p>I was shocked to see this came from Oliver Stone with such a weak and predictable script and cable-TV quality production values. The plot uses the backdrop of 9/11 to get immediate audience sympathy but if the story had been about buried coal miners instead, it would have been more obvious what a one-dimensional screenplay was being used here.<br /><br />The film suffers from a very long saggy mid-section where not much happens for nearly an hour, apart from cutting between the buried men and their distraught families. Much of the A-list talent is lost on restrictive roles that any character actor could have whistled through. And fundamentally, for such a tragic and monumental event, this film fails to capture any of significance of what happened.<br /><br />For a better "man buried alive" story, try 127 Hours. For a significantly better film about 9/11 that truly captures the emotion, I'd recommend United 93. Otherwise, this is very weak movie that attempts to use 9/11 to pull at the heart strings but wastes the talent and doesn't deliver.</p></body></html>

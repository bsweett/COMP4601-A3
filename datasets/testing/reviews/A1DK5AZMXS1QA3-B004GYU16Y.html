Whether it be Wanted, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Tombraider, or now this 2010 release, her live-action movies seem to blend into each other.  In this one, she is an American, raised as a Russian spy, who joins the CIA, pretends to carry out her mission for Russia, while intending to save America.  Sounds complicated?  Well, the action scenes help to explain everything, and it does it at under 2 hours in length.  For fans of Jolie's physique, you will be disappointed as she shows no skin; in fact she is often wearing various disguises.  For fans of Bond movies, the Bourne trilogy, and the Mission Impossible films, this is right up your alley.  Overall, an average movie whose biggest distinction is that the star is a female; unlike the previously listed male-anchored films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT !"></head><body><p>In most instances the characters on this movie just recite the same lines as in the 1974 original except when Crewe unnecessarily explains his actions to his team mates. Their biggest achievements appear to be a basketball game to convince the black inmates to join them against the guards, vulgarizing the hilarious warden secretary from the original film and adding plenty of distateful jokes. Adam Sandler is his usual annoying and uncharming self and if you believe him as a pro-QB you probably beleived Burt Reynolds as "Boss Hogg".<br /><br />What a waste of celuloid !</p></body></html>

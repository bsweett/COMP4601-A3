<meta name="summary" content="One of Kidman's best works, also a great horror experience."></head><body><p>The story of a mother(Nicole Kidman) and her two sick kids dealing with creepy things and possible ghosts in their new home, a mansion that is dark and mysterious inside, while waiting for her soldier husband to return. They only used candles in the house, and the servants are also eerie folks. This film is not a typical scary  movie, and it excels at creating a spooky atmosphere and psychologically scarry. It is almost entirely set inside the house, except for a few exterior scenes. Fionnula Flanagan is memorable as the servant who knows what's really going on in the house. This is probably Kidman's best work alongside To Die For and Moulin Rouge. She looks great in the '50s makeup and hair, and gets to deliver a wide range of emotions throughout this film. Don't expect this film to have scarry looking faces popping out of the dark, because it's more striking at the mind than the eyes.</p></body></html>

Caruso).  He plays Jerry Shaw, a ne'er do well who works at Copy Cabana.  He's chronically broke and behind on his rent, but he receives a surprise when he uses an ATM - over $700,000 has been deposited into his account.  That's just the beginning, though; when he returns home, he has received numerous deliveries to his small apartment.  As he goes through the boxes, he's shocked that they contain guns and other suspicious items.  That's when he receives the first call from a mysterious female caller; she tells him to flee the scene or else he'll be captured by the FBI.  The rest of the film unfolds with the female caller dictating Jerry's moves and involves a dead twin brother, a sexy mother, and Billy Bob Thornton, among other oddities.<br /><br />"Eagle Eye" is about what you would expect from a mid-level thriller.  There are some very good action scenes, particularly one involving a plane that tails Jerry's car into a tunnel.  LeBeouf is a likeable enough protagonist, and the movie has some nice twists.  There are also some clever scenes involving the female caller seeming to be omniscient and having unbelievable powers to control electronic items.  At the same time, the movie isn't very believable and does require a hefty suspension of disbelief.  It also cribs shamelessly from a number of other movies, including "Enemy of the State" and a dozen Hitchcock flicks.  However, if you want a mindless popcorn thriller, then you'll probably enjoy this movie.</p></body></html>

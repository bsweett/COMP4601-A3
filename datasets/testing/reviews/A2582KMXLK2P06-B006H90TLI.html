The action scenes involving an insane murderer going around killing people in graphic style was interesting to the natural horror fan inside of me, but understanding the point of all this went CLEAR over my head.  I can't blame the movie for that- only blame myself for not getting it, which explains why I'm giving the album a very good rating (a 4 out of 5).</p></body></html>

Along the way he encounters the ruthless leader of a small town, played by the great Gary Oldman, who believes that if he can get his hands on the book, he will be able to expand his influence and consolidate his power. This was an interesting story, with the mystery of where the book is going and why it is heading there always on the viewer's mind. The questions are answered at the end with a surprising plot twist.</p></body></html>

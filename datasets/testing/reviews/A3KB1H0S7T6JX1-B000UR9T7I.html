<meta name="summary" content="Truly AMAZING SPIDER-MAN!"></head><body><p>Spider-Man was GREAT, Spider-Man II was even BETTER, and now Spider-Man III is the CHERRY ON THE CAKE!<br /><br />This time the stakes are raised high with Spidey pitted against Sandman, Venom, New Goblin and possibly his most dangerous rival to date... himself!<br /><br />Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />The plot, the dialogues, the setting, the special effects, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, keep them coming!!!</p></body></html>

You  get a big, wonderful surprise every five minutes; the &quot;Malkovich  Malkovich Malkovich&quot; scene alone is worth the price of a rental! John  Malkovich himself was robbed when he didn't get a Best Actor or Supporting  Actor nomination, but considering the sheer glorious weirdness of this  movie, I must bow to the Academy for breaking its usual bonds and actually  giving this film nominations for Best Director, Screenplay and Supporting  Actress. If you're adventurous at all in your moviegoing tastes, this movie  is for you.</p></body></html>

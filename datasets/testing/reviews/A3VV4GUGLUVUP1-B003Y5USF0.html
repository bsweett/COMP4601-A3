The special effects are top-notch, but the story is so full of little Hollywood tricks, it's hard to take. <p> Why can't Helen Hunt be interested in tornadoes just because, well, tornadoes are interesting?  That's not good enough for this flick, so the screenwriters throw in a flashback to the terrifying twister that killed her dad.  It's as if they don't think the audience would believe and intelligent, attractive young woman would fritter away her life pursuing such an esoteric field of interest otherwise.  Just a touch of Freudian silliness and typical screenplay shorthand that substitutes for real characterization.  I was hoping that very same tornado would come back at the end so she could get revenge, but no such luck. <p> Also, you can tell Bill Paxton's the good guy because he has some sort of mystical connection with the twisters- plus, his crew are a bunch of rock-n-roll tornado cowboys.  They make supercells fun! <p> And Cary Elwes is the bad guy because not only can he not sense tornadoes, but he's in it for money.  It helps, too, that he drives around in all-black high tech vehicles.  Thanks for telegraphing that, people.  But then again, it's pretty easy to predict everything that's going to happen in the movie. <p> On the positive side, you get to see plenty of tornado mayhem and that's worth at least one star.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie only adds up to another.</p></body></html>

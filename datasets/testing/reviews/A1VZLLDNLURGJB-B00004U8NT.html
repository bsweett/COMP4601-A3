<meta name="summary" content="CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (Blu-Ray)"></head><body><p>This is the clearest, sharpest and most colorful transfer to Blu-Ray DVD I have ever watched! This film was made in 1977, prior to the well explored theme of government conspiracies with evil aliens intent on colonizing Earth. Earlier and later sci-fi films (with the exception of E.T.) have generally attributed much less benign motives to space aliens.<br /><br />Spielberg was able to get his audience to believe in well intentioned aliens interested in making first contact with authorities on Earth. A more difficult film to make interesting to audiences brought up on evil space critters, the film still works and many folks appear to enjoy it. While not one of my favorite films I do enjoy watching the very colorful visual effects.</p></body></html>

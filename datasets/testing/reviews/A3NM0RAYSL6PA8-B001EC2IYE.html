<meta name="summary" content="Solid film ... but certainly not great."></head><body><p>I saw Million Dollar Baby without knowing much about it -- other than it involved an aging fight trainer and his young protege.  That ain't the half of it, but I digress.<br /><br />You've heard this before: the story in Million Dollar Baby isn't terribly original. But how many of life's highlights and tragedies are?  Eastwood, who stars and directs, is trying to capture a slice of real life, and chances are that anyone who has lived a little bit will connect to the ordinary and extraordinary elements of this story.  So, it isn't that the story is old and chewed up, it's more about the universality of the human experience -- which is something that certainly could stand a lot more chewing.<br /><br />The weakest part of the movie, I think, is Clint Eastwood's acting.  I may be swimming against the current, but Eastwood's performance was thin and undercut the entire enterprise.  He just didn't sell me as the Gaelic-reading, mild-mannered, crotchety trainer who doesn't like taking risks.  I know the whole movie is Eastwood's "baby," but this casting mistake turns what could have been a glorious film into a decent one.<br /><br />Hillary Swank, in contrast, was perfectly cast, and maybe because the role hit so close to home.  Both she and her character had tough, trailer park beginnings, both overcame great obstacles, and both probably feel a little out of place in what passes for "culture" among the well-to-do.  She hits the quiet determination, optimism, and passion quotients just right.  It's hard not to see her as a life force, an indomitable survivor who has good instincts about right and wrong, and has just the right sprinkling of selflessness.  (Okay, at times she seems too good to be true, but I'll forgive her that given the dramatic final encounter with her hillbilly family.  Haven't we all experienced parts of that "scene" before?)<br /><br />Morgan Freeman does a great job with a weakly scripted character.  Sure, we've met guys like him -- wise, balanced, and skipping through life in a lowly job (he's an ex-fighter who is the janitor at Eastwood's gym).  But we don't see the counterpoint, the internal struggle, that animates him, that shows us he isn't this perfect, angelic figure narrating his way through life.  One can't help but compare Freeman's performance (and narration) in Million Dollar Baby to his similar role in The Shawshank Redemption.  On every level, it falls short -- sometimes by a little, often by a lot.  Eastwood's use of Freeman has, perhaps unfortunately, made such comparisons almost inevitable.<br /><br />The movie centers around a seminal event, and there are real pacing problems before it as well as afterwards.  No matter, it can't help but move you in its rather slow, methodical way.  We don't always need films to move forward at a blistering pace.<br /><br />The movie's ending -- poignant as it is -- was made ineffective in large part because of Eastwood's character and his performance.  There simply wasn't enough uncontrived humanity in it. It came close at times, like in the car ride back from a visit to Swank's family, but ultimately fizzled.</p></body></html>

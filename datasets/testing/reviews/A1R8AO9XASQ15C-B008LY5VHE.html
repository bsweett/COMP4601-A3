<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's best? Yep"></head><body><p>Here is Steven Spielberg's best film, not surprising since it is also one of his earliest, a movie that reflects not only commercial savvy but artistic passion and a true love for the moviemaking process. This is Spielberg displaying as much virtuosity as Quentin Tarantino would later show in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill.&quot;<p>&quot;Jaws&quot; is quite simply one of my favorite films, probably among the top 5. I just picked up a copy of the DVD and watched the movie again for the 40th or 50th time. It is staggering, the quality of this film. Spielberg's direction has done more than withstand the test of time; it shames the work by today's less-talented studio hacks like Stephen Sommers, Michael Bay, et al. Framing, pacing, camera placement, and every other tool in the director's toybox works to tell the story and give us information, not only about the shark's whereabouts, but the characters themselves.<p>The characters, and the actors who play them, are the real magic of &quot;Jaws.&quot; The shark is a wonderful special effect, to be sure, one of the most effective movie villains ever, but Brody, Quint and Hooper are the real stars. Their conflicted interrelationships hold the story together -- after all, there is a lot of screen time given over to the dialogue among these three men, when the shark isn't even a blip on the radar. Spielberg had a lot of faith in the ability of his actors to compete with the special effects, a faith he does not display today (&quot;A.I.,&quot; anyone?). This is just one reason why &quot;Jaws&quot; continues to work so well after 30 years.<p>A masterpiece of blood and guts (Quint's death scene is still hard to watch), &quot;Jaws&quot; is also underrated as a character piece. What a great movie this is.</p></body></html>

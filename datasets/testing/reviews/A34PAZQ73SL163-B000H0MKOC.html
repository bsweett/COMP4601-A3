Eckhart's work is suburb as his character manages to be both a caricature and a very real person. This is a portrait of the last days of Big Tobacco's arrogance before the states came in and nearly broke them. Nailer's speech to his son's class was absolutely hilarious as was the send up of the talk show used for the introduction. This is a truly equal opportunity spoof because it casts aspersions on practically everything and everybody including politics, the press, big business, and even child custody arrangements. Nothing is sacred here which is just how it should be.</p></body></html>

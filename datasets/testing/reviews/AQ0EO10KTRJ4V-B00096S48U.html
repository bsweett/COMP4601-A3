<meta name="summary" content="Some films don't need a remake !"></head><body><p>A remake is a tough thing to consider....<br /><br />Does one stay faithful to the original -or- try to revamp the film with something new to offer ?<br /><br />There is another important thing to consider, SOME FILMS DON'T NEED A REMAKE!<br /><br />The OMEN like PSYCHO is one of those films that can stand on it's own and had no need for a remake (like Led Zepplin's STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN).<br /><br />There is NOTHING a studio could do to win in this situation, although it appears they did make $$$ on this clunker.<br /><br />And of course we all understand film making is a business first and art second.<br /><br />However, all that aside, this remake of OMEN got off to a bad start with poor casting, bland performances and basically came across as FLAT.<br /><br />It almost seems the whole crew from actors to director were almost embarassed and ashamed to be remaking this film.<br /><br />It just gave that feeling when watching it.<br /><br />I was almost tempted to pull out the original and watch them side-by-side at the same time because unless I am mistaken the dialoge and scenes seem IDENTICAL as thought the exact 1970s shooting script was used for this remake.<br /><br />Watching this DVD (before we ejected it about 60 minutes in) was like looking at a polaroid picture of a beautiful woman as compared to having the real thing standing inches in front of you.<br /><br />The remake was just flat and lifeless.<br /><br />It would be more fun to see Hollywood do remakes of movies that had potential the first time, but failed.... to see if they can rework them and make a better film the second time.<br /><br />1975's DOC SAVAGE comes to mind.<br /><br />It was an early version of what Indiana Jones later became and SHOULD have been good since it was based on a popular 1930's pulp here.<br /><br />Instead the film was campy and died at the box office.<br /><br />It would be good for example to see a film like that done properly.</p></body></html>

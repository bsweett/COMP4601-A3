As a bit of a history buff I was aware that many of the ancient Greek men had male lovers.  I had heard some of the reviews mentioning the gay overtones, so I was not shocked or upset seeing them in the film.  I think that it was a sub plot not executed well.  My major problems with the film come from the fact that Stone has made Alexander a whining unlikeable character.  I don't know if it was the writing or the actor, but I really did not feel any charisma from Alexander.  The real Alexander has been reported to have had a temper and a huge ego, but there was a genius mind, a very brave heart, and a charisma that made men follow him to the end of the known world.  I just didn't feel that from this Alexander.  Also I wasn't a big fan of the quick cut battle scenes, and the lack of several key battles from the movie altogether.  The director's cut doesn't do very much to change any of the problems I had with the film.</p></body></html>

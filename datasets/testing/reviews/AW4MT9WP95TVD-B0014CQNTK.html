<meta name="summary" content="Well written; great performances"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this film.  I thought the screeenplay was so witty and well conceived. (no pun intended).  To the reviewer who said nobody talks like this: WRONG.  There really are some smart, witty people out there with quick wits and good vocabularies.<br /><br />Performances are uniformly great.  Page is wonderful and Bateman continues to impress as he ages.  Garner really surprised me with her brittle, edgy performance.<br /><br />A good catch.</p></body></html>

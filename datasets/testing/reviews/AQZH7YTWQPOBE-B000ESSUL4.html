<meta name="summary" content="Really poor editing"></head><body><p>I like historical epics generally, but this was a really poorly edited film. The story is hard to follow and some scenes seem to intrude on the story. There's very little context and the story isn't very clear. At some points, I was confused as to what was actually happening or why something did happen (for example, why was John Smith alone and captured in the first place?). It seems like the editing team had trouble producing a solid movie with the footage given, so tried to make it more abstract in some places - to the detriment of the viewer.<br /><br />At points, the characters narrate their thoughts, but rather than providing useful context this gets annoying. They simply recite their emotions, which are surprisingly bland (with John Smith calling the Native Americans perfect and in complete harmony). Such emotions would have been better explored through acting and interaction between the characters, rather than simply narrating them. And the soundtrack - very disappointing.<br /><br />The only bright spot was the acting - Q'orianka Kilcher played a decent Pocahontas. Colin Farrell wasn't bad as John Smith either, but not too inspiring.<br /><br />Hopefully the next remake of the story of Jamestown will do it right.</p></body></html>

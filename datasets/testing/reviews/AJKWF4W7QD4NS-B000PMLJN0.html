<meta name="summary" content="Dead on arrival"></head><body><p>Dead Silence is from director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannel; the same duo who crafted the first Saw film and oversaw their sequels.  Dead Silence also marks a departure in terms of changing the pace from the torture horror sub-genre to a more typical slasher fare which we get here.  The change isn't necessarily for the better either, even though Dead Silence has more going for it than you may think it does.  For starters, it's pretty safe to say that many people think of ventriloquist dolls as being creepy by themselves, and here the film doesn't disappoint.  Besides the overly creepy atmosphere though, Dead Silence doesn't do much else right in the horror department, and isn't scary or remotely suspenseful one bit.  The gore effects aren't much to write home about either, and the film as a whole just feels lazily put together.  In the end, you've just got to feel sorry for Donnie Wahlberg (Saw II and III, Band of Brothers) who gets no help as a detective here.  All in all, Dead Silence isn't a total turkey, but there's nothing overly redeeming about it either.</p></body></html>

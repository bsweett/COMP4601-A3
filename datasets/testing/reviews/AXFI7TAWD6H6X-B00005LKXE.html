<meta name="summary" content="Sick, disgusting...I loved it!"></head><body><p>I loved &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, the one of the handful of movies that scares the living daylights out of me. I read the book while the film version was still in its early stages. I was totally grossed out by what I read and I don't say that about just any book. The film version gave me the chills, not to mention repulsed me on the same level the novel did. I loved &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Granted that I would have loved to have seen Jodie Foster reprise her classic film role, Julianne Moore gave a stellar performance as Clarice Sterling. I thought she was perfect for Jodie's replacement. &quot;Hannibal&quot; may not be nearly as perfect as &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; in terms of quality, I still found it thoroughly engaging and entertaining. Ray Liotta's performance as that jerk Paul Krendler was just perfect. His character was a jerk in the book and a bigger jerk in the movie. Anthony Hopkins was and is Hannibal Lechter. He was still riveting and compelling to watch as he was in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger was priceless. He really gave me the creeps in the movie as the vengeful victim of Hannibal Lechter. For the most part, the movie stays faithful to the novel however for anyone who read the book before seeing the movie, you see the holes in the movie. Still it is rather difficult to make a film adaptation of a novel and keep it within a 2 hour limit. Despite the critics' desparaging reviews about the movie, I loved it and thought it was a worthy follow-up to a classic thriller.</p></body></html>

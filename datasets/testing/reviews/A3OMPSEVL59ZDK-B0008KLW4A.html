<meta name="summary" content="The first disaster of the summer"></head><body><p>Thought Van Helsing was the worst we would see this summer? Think again. Here comes Halle Berry in, what could be, the first huge failure of the summer, both critically and financially. Avoid this one at all costs folks. From the very start, the very idea of basing a film on a Batman villian was a bad idea. Turning her into a hero with super powers (catwoman has no powers, she's just at skilled theif) was a big mistake. With plenty of Marvel Films out there as great examples of HOW to do comic book films, WB's of course thinks they know better. Creating a film that is a mere shadow of the original character.<p>The supporting cast is also filled with terrible choices. Sharon Stone, Benjamin Bratt. When was the last time they made a good film? Remember Halle Berry and her terrible Storm perforomance in X-MEN? Have you SEEN Gothika? She should have her oscar ravoked for those atrocities. <p>Please be smart. Go watch something else this summer. Show WB that their contempt for the movie going audience has reached a new low. Catwoman deserves to bomb and than some.</p></body></html>

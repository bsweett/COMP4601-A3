To my surprise, I saw it in theaters with a friend and enjoyed it, mainly for the chasing around, but also for the characters and the subtle philosophical conspiracies of privacy, control, and over-reliance on technology (which a lot of these titles usually do).  In particular, I really like Jerry Shaw (played by Shia LaBeouf) and the way he progresses through the movie.  His journey strikes me as a sort of intrinsic desire that everyone has to try their hardest in order to make an honest living, with some of us making it higher on the social chain, while others are.. well, not so fortunate.  Not that there's anything wrong with a social gap, for the pros and cons of every person are unique and useful in their own way (as we see in this movie).  I just think his initial circumstances and the results by the end of the film make for an entertaining, yet heartwarming experience.  The one problem I do have, however, is with the suspension of disbelief.  Now, I'm all for the outrageous and unbelievable (this coming from a guy who watches anime), but the concept of ARIA just feels a tad too out-of-touch with reality.  Everything in the movie before "her" actual appearance feels so realistic, almost gritty.  Then to be presented with what "she" is kinda' takes away that built up realism.  And because of that, I recommend that if you haven't seen this movie yet, that you take it with a grain of salt and consider this more of a popcorn flick, rather than a full-blown conspiracy-thriller with real-world machinations.  Keep your imagination open and you'll probably enjoy it.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />Eagle Eye is presented to us by DreamWorks in MPEG-4 AVC with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  As I mentioned about enjoying most of the grittiness early on in the film, the visual style represents that feeling very well.  About half the of movie takes place in dark areas or at nighttime, so blacks levels are very important and do not disappoint.  Dark clothing, shadows, and pitch black darkness separate pretty well from one another, giving the overall film a great sense of realism and depth.  Accordingly, daytime and well-lit scenes also do an adequate job of displaying colors and contrast, exposing the finer details in flesh tones, backgrounds, objects, etc.  Some inconsistent levels of grain are present through a few shots, making this just short of demo material.  But given that the movie itself isn't even supposed to be that flashy, it's an excellent transfer, nonetheless.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />In addition to a near-flawless video encode, DreamWorks also provides a VERY capable TrueHD 5.1 track.  Dynamic range in combination with LFEs are most present during chase sequences and are accompanied by a bombastic musical score composed by Brian Tyler, who uses quite a bit of percussion, giving the overall sound stage a nice oomph to the sub-woofer.  Directionality goes from subtle to chaotic in the blink of an eye when on-screen action gets hectic, sending all sorts of sound effects from left to right, through the front, and back to the rears.  Dialogue is crisp and clear (yes, even Billy Bob sounds coherent) with zero dropout or discrepancy.  I was pleasantly surprised at how great this sounded, given it's not even an all-out action flick.  The car chase scene is reference quality.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />I always love seeing well-made production segments.  It shows me just how much work and effort goes into creating a film, giving me a greater sense of appreciation for what everyone in this industry seeks to accomplish.  While not as lengthy or in-depth as it could've been, the extras on this BD were enough to win me over.  The large majority of these extras include various interviews with director D.J. Caruso and other cast/crew, some brief commentary about the eerie reality of government privacy invasion, and then a few spots on design/shooting locale.  There's also a 7-minute gag reel, which I found hilarious given what Billy Bob was saying towards the end of it.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />Eagle Eye presents itself very well for a large majority of the movie.  It's an exhilarating conspiracy-thriller with lots of chases, plot twists, and even a little bit of character development.  That being said, the last small chunk at the end is a bit far fetched in comparison to everything prior.  But if you're willing to think outside the box and accept the unconventional here and there, you'll enjoy this.  Top that off with an almost-perfect video transfer and reference quality sound, and you've got a high recommendation on my part.</p></body></html>

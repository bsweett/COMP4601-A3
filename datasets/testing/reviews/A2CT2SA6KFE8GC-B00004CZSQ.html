In the much shunned subgenre of Italian horror, Dario Argento is one director who actually won the critics over a time or two.  You look on any top ten scary movie lists, you can bet Suspiria is on it.  This film isn't really frightening-in fact most people think it's stupid and/or corny- but it's certainly original.  The plot isn't much to brag about, this film is all about style.  I've always thought you could make a movie about anything and make it interesting if you presented it correctly.  Usually it's only the film snobs that pick up on the wild visual style Argento uses, but you certainly don't have to be a film snob to see it.  Alot of the people I suggest this to usually think it's boring and silly.  Granted these people aren't familiar with the genre and get scared to death by films like The House On Haunted Hill remake.  Sure, Suspiria has it's parts that  drag a bit, and the dubbing makes it sound corny(as usual), but all I can tell you is to view it with an open mind.  Go into it understanding that the Italians make horror films different from  American directors. And don't mistake different for dumb.  Argento's movies are pretty whacked out(in fact, he's pretty whacked out, check out his documentaries), and not all of them are masterpieces, but he's really got vision.  He's not a schlockmeister like his fellow countryman in Italian horror, Lucio Fulci(schlockmeister perhaps, but I love him to death), he's the kind of director that's likely to be studied in a film class.  He doesn't go for the all out gore attack like Fulci, but Argento's violence is certainly not for the squeamish.  The first murder scene in Suspiria is probably one of the most intense ever put on film.  I'll guarantee you everyone in the room will stop what they're doing to see it!  It may not have the Fulci gore, but it's got ten times more intensity.  I've rarely seen music used to such a great effect.  So, I'd definitely check this one out if you'd like to see Italian horror with an artsy edge.  In fact, you should see Suspiria just to say you've seen it.</p></body></html>

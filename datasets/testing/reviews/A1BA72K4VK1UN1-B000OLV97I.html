<meta name="summary" content="NOT a book comparison review (2-disc Special Edition), details"></head><body><p>I have not read the books associated with this film so I'm in a good position to evaluate the film on its own merit. Clearly people are all over the place with this film (from one star to five stars and everything in between) and I can detect without difficulty that many folks feel strongly about the movie either one way or another.<br /><br />THE STORY: This film manifests your basic "good versus evil" theme. A malevolent despot king rules the land but he has one fear -- that a "dragonrider" (and a dragon) will reappear to ultimately dethrone and destroy him. This nasty king has a powerful wizard of sorts, ready at his beck and call to deliver on his evil plans. The wizard rules over a really nasty pack of dreadful pseudo-humans who possess magical powers and skills.<br /><br />But the dragonrider, Eragon, and his female dragon, Saphira, also utilize magic to do battle with the bad guys. Various mentors and allies come along to guide and aid Eragon and, of course, there is a culmination of the two factions in a Battle Royal. The film's conclusion clearly leaves the way open for the sequel film.<br /><br />Let me say up front that this is a fine fantasy film, lots of action, a good story, superb cinematography, and great acting. What I detected was a number of "film techniques" (for lack of a better phrase) which mirrored the action in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>.<br /><br />I realize that they are the same sort of story and that "Eragon" may, in fact, soon turn into a series of films like LOTRs; however, at every turn I kept finding myself reliving scenes from LOTRs so I was just a tiny bit distracted by this.<br /><br />The huge bulk of complaints that I see on this film (especially at IMDB) is that the books are purportedly so much better than the film. Well, when was this not true in the case of nearly any film which had its genesis in a book? So I therefore discount much of this facet of criticism, even though it may be true. I felt the same way about LOTRs but this diminution of excellence from book to film was a personal expectation -- as a consequence, I was not disappointed when I viewed the film trilogy.<br /><br />So here are my recommendations: if you have read the books and feel strongly that the film will be a weak second, then don't watch it. But if you've never read the books and you want to see a fine film (even if it borrows a bit in technique from LOTRs), then I think that you'll enjoy this one.<br /><br />The Special Edition version contains a second disc -- here's what you'll find on it:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with Director Stefen Fangmeier.<br />-- extended and deleted scenes with optional director's commentary.<br />-- "Inside the Inheritance Trilogy": "The Magic of Eragon" documentary.<br />-- "Eldest" -- the first two chapters of the second book in the "Inheritance Trilogy".<br />-- "The Inhabitants of Alaga?sia" character featurettes.<br />-- Arya's Ambush original animatic sequence with optional director's commentary.<br />-- Vision of Eragon conceptual art gallery.<br />-- pronunciation guide.<br />-- original and unused storyboard galleries.<br />-- Christopher Paolini interview.<br />-- "The Secrets of Alaga?sia" visual effects featurette.<br />-- Saphira's animation guide CGI featurette with director's commentary.<br />-- original teaser and trailer<br /><br />This 2006 film is in widescreen and runs a total of 103 minutes.</p></body></html>

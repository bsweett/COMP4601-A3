Imagine Michael Moore writing/directing Batman meets Zorro.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is visually impressive.  It has that dark feel of Tim Burton's films.  Hugo Weaving conveys more emotion from behind a mask than most actors can manage with faces fully exposed.  The fighting scenes -- what few there are -- are enjoyable.<br /><br />At the risk of giving too much away, the hero, V, is a modern-day Guy Fawkes, who is still remembered in England every year on November 5th.  Interestingly -- and without knowing beforehand the connection between V and Guy Fawkes -- I rented and watched this movie on November 5th.  If anything good came out of viewing V for Vendetta is that it made me want to learn more about Guy Fawkes. The movie was otherwise a disappointment.</p></body></html>

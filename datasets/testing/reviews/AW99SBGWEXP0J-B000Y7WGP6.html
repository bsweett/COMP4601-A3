<meta name="summary" content="The Kingdom"></head><body><p>In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in a community of foreign oil workers and their families, terrorists shoot and bomb the residents.  More than 100 people die, including some FBI agents.  In the US, Ronald Fleury (Foxx) gets his forensic team ready for an investigation.  They consist of: Janey Mayes (Garner, a pathologist; Adam Leavitt (Bateman), a computer expert; and Grand Sykes (Cooper), an explosives expert.  His team is allowed into Saudi Arabia, but they have to be watched by police-colonel Al-Ghazi (Barhom).  Of course, he is more intent on keeping the peace than getting to the bottom of things, and as Fleury and his team get closer to the answers they are looking for, things begin to spiral out of control.<br /><br />"The Kingdom" is an excellent movie that is both intelligent and suspenseful.  It is well acted all around, and especially by Jason Bateman.  He has the meatiest role, and gives a strong dramatic performance.  He also gets the best one-liners.  The story and direction are top notch.  The movie is tense and urgent, pulling the viewer in with ease.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

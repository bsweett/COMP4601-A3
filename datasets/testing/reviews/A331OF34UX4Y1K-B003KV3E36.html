After Rocky Balboa,a  movie almost mellow, then Sly produces Rambo IV, one of the most violent movies EVER! Heads split open all the time, knives are plunged into bodies all the time... and the plot begin with a humanitarian mission... Pretty blunt irony...<br /><br />Well, at least this was made the old way: almost no blue or over the top CGI...<br /><br />I just wonder what David Morrell thinks about Sly anda Hollywood did to John Rambo (other than being happy for getiting more dollars from his creation).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Yeah, it's a ridiculous idea, but that's the whole point"></head><body><p>In the near-future Detroit becomes so plagued by crime that the police resort to Robocop (Peter Weller), a cyborg police officer, in order to clean up the streets. However, Robocop, who has the mind of a human police officer who was killed in the line of duty, is plagued by nightmares of his death and is compelled to seek out the men who "killed" him and avenge his own death.<br /><br />After watching "Robocop", I mentioned it to a friend of mine, who told me that he had never really wanted to see this film because he always thought it looked kind of ridiculous. To be honest, up until a week ago, that's exactly how I felt about it too. However, after recently watching "Starship Troopers" and falling madly in love with it, I found myself seeking out other films directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Ed Neumeier, no matter how bad they might seem, which inevitably led me to their earlier collaboration "Robocop".<br /><br />Yes, "Robocop" is a ridiculous film, but that's the whole point of it. "Robocop" is a far-fetched and ultra-violent satire of law-enforcement and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Between "Robocop" and "Starship Troopers", Paul Verhoeven is rapidly ascending the list of my favourite directors. He is an A-list director who takes B-grade material and turns it into grade-A final product. What is not to admire about this man? (OK, I have haven't seen "Showgirls", but I suspect that would answer my question).<br /><br />"Robocop" is an incredibly violent film (even more so if you watch the director's cut), which may upset some viewers, but to me the violence just added to the fun. It's not disturbing or disgusting, it's just over-the-top and adds to the satire. If you're the sort of person who considers over-the-top violence to be an acceptable form of entertainment, then you'll love "Robocop".</p></body></html>

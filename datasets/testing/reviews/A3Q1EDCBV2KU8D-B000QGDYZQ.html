<meta name="summary" content="Love Sandra Bullock, but this was hard to watch"></head><body><p>It took awhile just to get down what was going on in this movie, there was a real flow problem and way too much confusion for my tastes.  It took a lot just to finish this movie.  I think the biggest problem was viewer understanding of what days Sandra was in at what part of the movie since there was so much bouncing around.  The ending wasn't all that great feel-good either, left my wife a little stressed about life and not the effect she wanted.  Needless to say, this movie won't be staying in our library.  Watch if you want, just don't suggest that you buy it.</p></body></html>

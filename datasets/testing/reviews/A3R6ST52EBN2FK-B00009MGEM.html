Ok, I had a problem with that annoying and grating on the nerves guy that sold chicken and had the freak show ride.  The ride was really cool though when they finally got to it.  When the kids leave his place and go in search of Dr. Satan and pick up the hichhiker, it picks up a lot.  It seemed like it took forever, but it starts getting better.  This movie was awesomelly filmed at the end too.  The camera angles on faces were some of the finest I've ever seen and totally saved the movie.  Too bad more than half of the beginning was so dull. On the extras on Sherri Moon's comments on stabbing and stuff, I really appreciated what she said.  Her performance was so creepy and real I was beginning to wonder...  Its not real its not real its not real...</p></body></html>

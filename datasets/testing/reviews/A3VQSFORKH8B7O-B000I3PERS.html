Following in the footsteps of Leonard Nimoy (&quot;Star Trek III: The Search For Spock&quot;, &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,&quot; &quot;Three Men And A Baby&quot;), Clint Eastwood (&quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Space Cowboys&quot;), and Kevin Costner (the hit &quot;Dances With Wolves,&quot; and the clunker &quot;The Postman&quot;), Gibson is another actor who can direct a film that wins several Oscars (This film won 5, including Best Picture- 1995). This film deserved them all! Great acting, dramatic music from Oscar winner James Horner, and some of the most accurate, if not the most extremely graphic, battle scenes ever committed to the big screen. Gibson's first time playing a hero, instead on an anti-hero, like in the &quot;Mad Max,&quot; and &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies, makes it his second best performance (&quot;The Patriot&quot; being the best). This film will be remebered as making war films popular again (this movie grossed $77 Million). Bravo, Mel! Grade: A+</p></body></html>

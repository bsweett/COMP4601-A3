<meta name="summary" content="What's that coming out of your chest? Same thing that goes bump in the night-IN SPACE!"></head><body><p>This is a terrific movie! Alien is my second favorite space monster next to Predator, and the scariness and cool fight scenes of this film were terrific, as were the gross parts with blood and acid and  ooze! I thought the Aliens were scary looking and plenty evil and powerful, and it ends in a way you'd never guess! Alien's a very well made and classic movie, and I recommend it to all who enjoy  scary stuff! As I said, it's a terrific movie! See it!</p></body></html>

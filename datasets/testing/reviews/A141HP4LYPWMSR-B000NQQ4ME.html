<meta name="summary" content=""Beware The Blackness Of Day" ~ Culture Conflict, Prophecy And The Endless Cycles of Beginnings And Endings"></head><body><p>Note: Native American with English subtitles.<br /><br />The '06 epic film 'Apocalypto' is a stunning cinematic achievement that is so graphic in its depiction of violence the viewer could easily become overwhelmed by its visceral assault on the senses and miss the more subtle nuances of this well constructed storyline. There are numerous avenues of thought one could pursue in examining this movie such as;<br /><br />1) The exploitation of one culture over another,<br />2) Man's instinct to survive and overcome adversity,<br />3) The power of love,<br />4) The endless cycles of beginnings and endings and<br />5) The prophetic nature of human history that transcends all cultural and religious boundaries.<br /><br />There's much to digest in this film that doesn't immediately present itself on the initial viewing. It's more than a big budget revenge film where the hunted eventually becomes the hunter. Watch it again, you might discover something you missed the first time.</p></body></html>

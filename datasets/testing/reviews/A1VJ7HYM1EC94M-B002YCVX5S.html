In fact, not to jinks him or wish him anything but the best in future endeavors, but it is my opinion the odds of him surpassing what he has achieved in this film are slim indeed.<br /><br />While there have been numerous complaints (even in the most complimentary of reviews) of the many incongruous elements found throughout the film, I have found it is the very disparity of those elements that tie this film into a unifying whole - and precisely what makes it one of the most satisfactory films and satisfying movie experiences of 2009.  It is this genre-busting, "what is it?" quality that makes it unique among the major players of this year's top films.<br /><br />Visually, Tarantino has done nothing to date that quite matches the opulence he achieves here a tailor made look evocative of the "Grand Hollywood Style" of those glorious Technicolor epics of the 50's, 60's and 70's.  Like those, every frame of "Inglorious Basterds" seems worthy of being reproduced as "art" in its own right.  The color spectrum he employs throughout is rich and vivid in that 1950's fashion - simultaneously lurid yet beautiful.<br /><br />He elicits performances from his cast that are among the most memorable seen in years.  The arc of the Shoshana story - Melanie Laurent in a powerfully searing performance that throbs with a ferocious intensity, anchors the various chapters of the film brilliantly.  That performance is matched (and maybe even surpassed) by her chief tormentor, in the guise of Austrian actor Christopher Waltz as Hans Landa of the SS.  Waltz, in fact, makes one of the most amazing film debuts in American film history.  Chilling doesn't begin to describe his performance here.<br /><br />Not to be outdone by her costars, Diane Kruger gets to star in one of Tarantino's most brilliantly conceived scenes from any of his films - the basement bar scene.  As the unlikely (and hilariously) named Bridget Von Hammersmark, Kruger gives her finest performance since Joyeux Noel and proves herself both as comedian and grand tragedienne.<br /><br />The Basterds - headed by Brad Pitt - have found some critics singling theirs out to be the weakest element of the movie, but I disagree.  Strongly.  While the danger of the European war front can be elegantly confusing throughout the entire film (e.g., the almost Andrew Wyeth spareness of the opening chapter; the inviting danger of the basement bar; the opulence of the Cinetheque, etc.) the sheer audacity and brutality of the scenes with the Basterds adds a provocatively American feel to the story's proceedings.<br /><br />The Basterds are almost a comic chorus line -  not quite interchangeable archetypes in a film otherwise populated with specific and memorable characters.  Of course several of them (including Mr. Pitt) get to partake in a finale that is (even by Tarentino standards) so over the top it is nothing if not jaw dropping.  The entire finale offers one of the most hauntingly beautiful and memorable scenes modern cinema has had to offer in a very long time.<br /><br />Mr. Tarantino paints all of this onto the broadest canvas possible using a palette that combines the almost unseemly mixtures of film noir, slapstick, crude comedy, art house film, historical fiction, James Bond-style slickness, buddy pic and action flick seemingly without a fleeting concern as to what anybody else thinks.  It's a "take no prisoners" style of filmmaking that (clearly) does not play to all tastes and demands that it be taken on its own terms.  If one is willing to take that journey with him the rewards are remarkable and immeasurable.  A truly remarkable film achievement.  Bravo, Signor Tarantino!</p></body></html>

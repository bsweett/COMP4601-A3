The movie is completely predictable and the laugh quotient is a low 2.5 chuckles per hour. The "dragon lady," Miranda Priestly, is not just impossible to work for, she's IMPOSSIBLE to work for. She requires her lowly, untrained, inexperienced assistant to perform miracles and menial chores every day, and we never see Miranda do anything extraordinary. Miranda mumbles her cryptic orders too fast even for a court stenographer to understand. We witness Andy, the naive, fashion-challenged new assistant, undergo a fashion and personality makeover, topping it off with an affair not to remember. We see the devastation of everyone's personal life, which isn't even good for dark humor. We hear an oddly earnest speech about the merits of a dysfunctional, destructive, and corrupt work ethic. And in the rarefied and cutthroat atmosphere of high fashion we see Andy regain her sense of humanity, not to save herself, but to protect her abuser's "delicate" feelings. Well, they had to contrive a happy ending somehow.</p></body></html>

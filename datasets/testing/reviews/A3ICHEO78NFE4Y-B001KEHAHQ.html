I actually felt inbarrassed for the actors.  Why put them in this type of situation where it is just not funny.  There was only one Peter Sellers and when he died he took his humor along with him.  As in "King Kong" and so many other films leave these as classics.  The key word for Hollywood is "classic."  It means just fine the way it is.  I won't view this again even if i was paid to watch it.  It's that bad.</p></body></html>

Cunningham's seminal splatter movie. Borne from the success of HALLOWEEN (1978), Cunningham's film reworked the template set down by John Carpenter, placing a group of vulnerable teens in an isolated location (in this instance, a run-down summer camp plagued by a series of unexplained 'accidents') before unleasing a deadly, unstoppable force against them. Cunningham underlined the element of mystery and suspense by hiring makeup wiz Tom Savini - fresh from his groundbreaking work on DAWN OF THE DEAD - to stage a series of elaborately gruesome set-pieces. This potent combination knocked mainstream audiences sideways, and the film was a huge success, spearheading a wave of independent horror films which dominated movie screens in the early 1980s and spawned a slew of sequels and rip-offs which continue to this day, to a point where the original film has become somewhat lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />Viewed objectively, FRIDAY THE 13th is perhaps a little too slow-burning for its own good. Victor Miller's one-dimensional script allows the gory murders to punctuate a labored narrative which takes too long in setting out its meagre stall. Too much time is wasted on petty details - characters make coffee, wander in the woods, hunt for snakes in the cabins, etc. - while a ubiquitous Evil Presence lurks ominously nearby. However, once the stage has been set and the mayhem begins, this deceptively simple premise comes into its own, and Cunningham cranks up the tension for a show-stopping finale which raised terrified audiences from their seats duting the film's initial run. Production values are functional but effective, distinguished by Harry Manfredini's instantly recognizable score ("ch-ch-ch!") - a memorable variation obn PSYCHO's shrieking violins - and Barry Abrams' unobtrusive cinematography, which makes a real virtue of the woodland locations.<br /><br />The cast includes a young Kevin Bacon and Harry Crosby (Bing's grandson), and Walt Gorney parlays the cliched character of 'Crazy Ralph' (a prophet of doom) into something of a cult figure. But the show belongs to veteran Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees, an old friend of the camp's owner, whose arrival late in the film gives the proceedings a much-needed kick up the backside. Oh, and watch out for Ari Lehman, making the kind of splashy entrance that most other movie stars would kill for...<br /><br />Over the years, "Friday" has been a useful tool for critics to bash the horror genre, citing it as an example of all that's bad in modern moviemaking. Even the trailer seems to have its tongue firmly embedded in its cheek ("You may only see it once, but that will be enough!"). But for all its faults, the film has aged gracefully, and the shocks and scares still have the power to take unwary viewers by surprise.<br /><br />Followed by FRIDAY THE 13th PART 2 (1981) and what seems like several thousand other sequels...</p></body></html>

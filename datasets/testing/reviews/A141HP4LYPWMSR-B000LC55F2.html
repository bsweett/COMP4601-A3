<meta name="summary" content=""Cipher, An Enigma, A Search, A Search For Answers" ~ The Quest For Real Magic, Or The Price Of A Good Trick"></head><body><p>Synopsis: Can two rival turn of the century (1800-1900's) magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) discover the ultimate magic trick without killing each other in the process?<br /><br />The '06 release of the film `The Prestige' instantly became the box office rival of another magical oriented film, `The Illusionist' which was also released in '06. Both have a turn of the century storyline and both deal with the trials and tribulations of their profession and the obsessive compulsive personalities that drive its practitioners to greater and greater heights of prestidigitation.<br /><br />While there are other similarities that could be made between the two films, they are also quite different and distinctive in their own right. What fascinated me about `The Prestige' is the inclusion of the real life visionary, scientist Nikola Tesla into the storyline. This clever addition added volumes of credibility and possibility to the tale and injected a much needed dose of depth and texture to the magical musings of the warring magicians.<br /><br /> As for the all important question, which is the superior film? They both receive 5 Stars in my opinion, so I leave you to decide for yourself.</p></body></html>

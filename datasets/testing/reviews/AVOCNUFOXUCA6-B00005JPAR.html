He is a true photographer/cinematographer, and most productions would be lucky to have him in that capacity.<br /><br />The problem, to me, is the story or lack thereof in which that great visual art is in service.  "Requiem for a Dream" was an afterschool special.  And "The Fountain" is simply a muddled, manipulative mess that will have you reaching for the fast-forward button.  "The Fountain" moves so slowly that it makes "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" seem like "Die Hard."  The story and plot are nonexistent, which allow you the viewer to project any plot onto it that you like.  If you're into that sort of thing, that's cool.  Hey, I decided to pretend that the whole movie was the post-death "moving toward the light" experience of that guy who died near that beginning - it's "Carnival of Souls," if you will, but with 10,000 times bigger of a budget and 1% of the entertainment.<br /><br />Many reviewers below contend that if you don't like this movie, you're stupid.  Au contraire - if you don't like this movie, you simply demand some level of coherent plot in your motion pictures.  If you're not a plot person, this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Those viewers who loved "2001: A Space Odyssey" may enjoy "The Fountain."  Others may wish to avoid, or to rent it and watch with one finger over the fast-forward button and one over the eject button.</p></body></html>

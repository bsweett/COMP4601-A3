<meta name="summary" content="Caregivers are scared in this Japanese house."></head><body><p>Everyone saw the television commercial for this movie and it scared the goosebumps on us.  It must be the quickest release to DVD for a film.  We also remember "The Saw" (2004) advertisement too.<br />  Yoko (Yoko Maki) is a health-care provider to an American woman, Emma (Grace Zabrishie) in Japan who is unable to take care of herself.  Yoko hears something and searches around the house for noise.  She opens a door, similar to a closet and looks around as if it's an attic.  Suddenly something pulls her up and she is gone.<br />  Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the substitute caregiver to take care of Emma.  She finds Emma in horrible conditions.  After cleaning her up, she too begins to hear noises.  She finds a black cat with one yewllow eye and one green eye and a Japanese boy.  After discovering the cordless phone gone, she sees out the corner of her eye someone walk by the door in Emma's room.  She opens the sliding door and Emma is frightened.  Emma says, "I just want her to leave me alone".  Suddenly frightened again, Karen turns around and sees the most horrifing thing of all.<br />  This movie centers around Emma and people connected to her.  This thing just isn't in this house, but can go to other places too to haunt you.<br />  Also in the cast: Bill Pullman (The Serpent and the Rainbow), Clea DeVall, Kadee Strickland, jason Behr, William Mapother (ABC LOST tv series), Rosa Blasi and Ted Raimi.  Toshio is played by Yuya Ozeki.<br />  Directed by Takashi Shimizu.<br />  DVD includes behind-the-scenes stuff, how nice and specific Director, Takashi Shimizu is and in "Under The Skin", Joseph LeDoux, Ph.d will explain to you why we like to be scared.

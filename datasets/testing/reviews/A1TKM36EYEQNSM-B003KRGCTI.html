<meta name="summary" content="Washington, Oldman, Kunis - Great Cast, Great Story Line"></head><body><p>Reminiscent to scenes from The Road, Eli is walking on road with the land around parched and devesatated.  You come to understand that decades before, mankind had decided that destroying himself was the thing to do.  Washington/Eli comes across some bad guys who he dispatches quickly.  He is like a super hero.  There is nothing he can do wrong in fighting these guys who are trying to take what he has.  Yet, this is some very intense violence, some of the more gory violence as well.  There are some off scene but mostly quick hitting in your face type violence.  There are yet more of this to come.<br /><br />But the story moves a little slowly as he walks toward his ultimate goal.  Moving West.<br /><br />Washington is very intense in this movie.  Gary Oldman (Carnegie), is an ornery leader of a town where it is like the wild west.  They have water, some food, but not much else.  The decay is endless, and you wonder what town they are in.  Kunis plays a young woman who is basically a subject of Oldman, and she comes into contact with Eli and gets involved in his quest without her complete understanding of what it is.<br /><br />The movie is very good, yet, since there are times where you see the devastation and he seems to walk somewhat onward, it may have been good as a subplot to have Eli's early life shown as well as that of Carnegie's. Actually in the DVD extra there is a bit on Carnegie as a child and that may have been a good way to do this, injecting it into the scenes without losing the flavor or the moment.<br /><br />As you know, the book that Eli is carrying is the Bible.  There is a tug here.  The Bible is blamed for the cause of the disaster that has the world as it is.  Yet, it is a book of hope.  One wants it to control others, the other, wants it because he is destined to.<br /><br />The scenes of the bridges and towns after the destruction are intense and seem even real.  The ending is a surprise, gives you a wow moment for sure.  I like the Book of Eli and hope that it continues to find success.</p></body></html>

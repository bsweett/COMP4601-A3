<meta name="summary" content="An Epic Film"></head><body><p>I saw Kingdom of Heaven when it came out and was immediately taken with Ridley Scott's epic tale.  The story of the film has been well discussed in other reviews so I will mention the 45 additional minutes in this cut.<br /><br />I thought that the beginning of the film could use some additional scenes to give the viewer more of a background to Balian, and the new director's cut does just that.  We learn that Balian has been to war and involved in engineering.  We see Balian's wife alive in a flashback and even Godfrey (Liam Neeson) has a moment when he recalls a meeting with Balian's mother.  We also get a brief glimpse of Godfrey's older brother, the Lord of the area, who seems a bit jealous of his brother and his nephew.  It is this nephew who later attempts to arrest Balian.  The most significant addition to the film is Sibylla's young son who is the heir to the throne of Jerusalem.  There is a good deal of discussion about this sub-plot in the accompanying bonus material and it adds significantly to Eva Green's character, creating a much more complex woman when she realizes that her son is condemned to die the slow death of her brother.  With the additional footage in the film one can better appreciate the performance of Ms. Green.<br /><br />There are small additions to the film that expand scenes.  For example, one of the grave diggers that is burying Balian's wife at the start of the film shows up in Jerusalem and fights in the siege.  We also have a final duel between Balian and Guy de Lusignan.  A minor addition perhaps but it helps connect Balian to his earlier life and we can observe how the people under siege believe in their leader.  The film was carefully researched and all of the major characters are historical, except for Godfrey but there is not much know about them.  The performances are superb: Marton Czokas is, as always, a marvelous villain, Jeremy Irons is outstanding as Tiberias and Edward Norton is an impressive King Bardwin, just to name a few.  This allows Ridley Scott the opportunity to flesh out his characters (however, we can be fairly certain that Sybella did not have a romantic fling with Balian) while remaining true to their personalities.  The casting of Arab roles was restricted to Arab actors and Ghassan Massoud makes an impressive Saladin and Alexander Siding is very good as Nasir.  There has been a lot of speculation that Ridley Scott had a message about Iraq in mind when making this film but I think the director has been clear that his idea behind the film was to show that the age old conflicts of the Middle East have had their share of good and bad people in every camp.<br /><br />This is a visually stunning and beautifully acted film that held my attention from start to finish.  In his Director's cut Ridley Scott has created an epic film worthy of a place among the best.</p></body></html>

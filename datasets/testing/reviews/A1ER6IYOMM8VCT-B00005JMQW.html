<meta name="summary" content="THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER....... ONLY THE SEQUEL COULD BE BETTER"></head><body><p>So few sequels outshine the original. How many can you name? The Godfather 2...maybe?,.....Aliens....eehh..maybe!?, but not in my book. Ok Thats about all that come to mind........Oh yeah Spiderman 2! This film works on many levels and defies it's popcorn movie status  everuy step of the way. Perfectly cast, Great adaption to the comic book and a fantastic perfomances by Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, way better than in the comic! Can't wait for Spider-Man 3.........The 2 disc DVD set is great. If you like it..BUY IT!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not very good"></head><body><p>It's not easy replacing Harrison Ford as a beloved screen hero, but Ben Affleck brings fresh vitality to The Sum of All Fears, reviving Paramount's Tom Clancy franchise in the role Ford made famous. As CIA agent Jack Ryan, Affleck is a rookie in the covert ranks, unraveling a plot that lures Russian and American superpowers into a nuclear standoff, while a neofascist faction turns most of Baltimore into an atomic wasteland and holds the world in the grip of a terrorist nightmare. Unfortuneately this film doesn't succeed at anything besides putting the viewer to sleep. There is very little character developement in this 2 hour long movie, and the A-BOMB sequence only lasts for about 5 seconds! Don't see this, it's not worth the money.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not your typical action film revolving around just war and politics!"></head><body><p>One of the finest films based on marine life, which does not totally emphasize on just wars. 'Jarhead' doesn't showcase marine films as a typical war or action/heroism flick, its much more than that. Let's forget war and politics for sometime and simply just look into the lives of these soldiers, who happen to be a human just like you and me. A brilliant performence from Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamiee Fox quite easily engages your mind and glues you to the edge of your seat, the chemistry between them is outstanding. The musical score is decent and the cinematography is simply breathtaking. Overall, A decently made film, moreover a real film with real characters.</p></body></html>

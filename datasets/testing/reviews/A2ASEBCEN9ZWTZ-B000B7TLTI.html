<meta name="summary" content="INCREDIBLE"></head><body><p>If I could sum up Pixar's latest offering in one word it would be, Incredible.<br /><br />The film is a marriage made in heaven as most people would agree that Pixar animation films rock because of the animation.  Most kids (and kids at heart) also mark out big time for superheroes movies and cartoons SO a Pixar animated Super Hero flick = $$$,$$$.$$<br /><br />THE PLOT:<br /><br />The movie opens up almost like a scene out of the Batman or Spider-Man or Superman cartoons with Mr. Incredible out and about saving the day.<br /><br />From there the film takes a humorous twist with all super-heroes being banned from practicing their trade due to lawsuits (ah yes, only in the 21st Century can you SUE a super-hero for saving lives) and we fast forward to see the super-heroes fat and out of shape and bored.<br /><br />We also see that our two main characters Mr. Incredible and Elasti-Girl are now married with three mutant kids of their own.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible is tricked back into action by two old conniving rivals with a dastardly plot to destroy him and all the former superheroes.  When all looks bleak with Mr. Incredible sidelined it takes the combined power of the Incredibles family to save him.<br /><br />THE COOL THINGS:<br /><br />I TOTALLY dug the vibe throughout the movie.  With the initial Batman vibe as Mr. Incredible makes his way throughout town saving lives and helping people and the later "Fantastic Four" and "Bionic Six" vibe the movie TOTALLY rocked my world.<br /><br />The plot villain is masterfully inserted into the film with a legitimate grudge against our hero and is brilliantly weaved in and out of the film.  Awesome writing, character development and continuity from the Pixar gang.  Plus, he's actually a cool (if geeky/dorky) villain.<br /><br />Seeing the kids come out of their shells and display and use their cool powers was awesome.  Pixar's animation gets better and better and most of all the movie's ending seems to leave open the possibilities for a SEQUEL.<br /><br />THE VERDICT:<br /><br />Hey, if you dig Pixar animation or Super-Hero flicks or toons, you KNOW you'll see this one.<br /><br />Highest Recommendation</p></body></html>

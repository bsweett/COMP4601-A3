"Brave New World" has been the ghost behind "Fahrenheit 451", "THX1138", "Gattika", "1984" and "A Clockwork Orange". Oppressive, sprawling government plows on unchallenged, until one individual decides to rebel/conform/escape. In the case of "V For Vendetta", we're talking a rebellion based on the inimitable botched plot of Guy Fawkes, on the fifth of November, 1605. A character, who we only know as "V", saves a media go-fer, played by Natalie Portman, just as she's about to be raped by two "enforcers" of the fascist government that has come to rule all of Britain and Lord knows where else, as the USA has declined into chaos and lost its position in the world. This character, a very well educated, cultured individual dead set on bringing down the Orwellian nightmare that is all around him, draws the grateful young girl into his world, giving her selective information on himself, judging her own possible inclination toward rebellion.<br /><br />This character wears a stylized Guy Fawkes "mask" 24/7, giving him a bizarre, stage-like appearance, with his permanent "expression" basically a smug grin topped by narrowed eyes. Hugo Weaving gives a terrific performance as the cultured "V", amazing you with his eloquence and style, not to mention his ruthlessness and determination in his mission. Another fine performance is given by John Hurt, as the main villain in the piece, the grand leader of the dystopic government, Chancellor Adam Suttler. Odd that the actor who played the victimized Winston Smith in 1984's "Nineteen-Eighty-Four", should play Big Brother in this piece. Natalie Portman provides a waifish, affecting visual as Evey, "V"'s essential "sidekick" in the film, but her attempt to synthesize a British accent leaves a little to be desired.<br /><br />"Blackadder" and "Wooster and Jeeves"'s Stephen Fry portrays Dietrich, a government approved wag that broadcasts his show to mollify the masses, until he decides to go after Suttler himself in one final episode of his TV show. Other actors involved are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Sinead Cusack as a medical technician that has some history with "V".<br /><br />There is a Mephistophelean quality to "V" that will have you fascinated with him from the very beginning. Weaving's subtle, sometimes graceful performance, (the violent scenes are choreographed like ballet!) ought to at least have him CONSIDERED for an oscar nod! You are constantly amazed at: how well informed he is, how cultured he is, and how intelligent and resourceful and adept he is.<br /><br />But all this still doesn't counter what I think is an ending that sends a bad message. In the end (spoiler alert!) both Parliament and BIG BEN are blown up as "V" is given a viking sendoff by young Evey. This is after, in one of the opening scenes, Old Bailey is blown up as well! Somebody doesn't like Blair's Britain, eh wot?<br /><br />A VERY intriguing movie that gives the whole "1984" storyline a new spin. Purchase if you dare!</p></body></html>

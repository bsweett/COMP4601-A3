For some reason where ever Gump goes so does tragedy! From Jenny, Lieutenant Dan or Bubba to name a few they al seem to have some kind of physical or emotional problem after they meet Gump! I know a story hast to be propelled with drama but to give the central chracter all the best lines and all the best expressions to deal with the ordeals is just plain wrong! Forrest Gump leaves a little murmur in the viewers heart after its all over. But to its credit Gump is a tear jerker at its best. Zemeciks uses digital feathers and faux handicaps to paint a depressing, dark and dank world with only one bright spot and his name is Forrest &quot;Grim Reaper&quot; Gump. The film plays on every emotion from adolescence to childhood that the viewer has no choice but to root for the cinema's ultimate dim-witted hero! A good film in its own Gump-ish ways.</p></body></html>

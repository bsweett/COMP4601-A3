<meta name="summary" content="DAMIEN...ALL GROWN UP"></head><body><p>This 1981 film is the second sequel to the oustanding, 1976 gothic thriller "The Omen". The Antichrist, Damien Thorn (Sam Neill), is now all grown up and, having inherited the entire family maga fortune, is now in the process of fulfilling both his destiny and a biblical prophecy of calamitous proportions. Unfortunately for him, however, his very existence is in jeopardy, as the second coming of Christ appears imminent.<p>Damien is kept busy in this film. As Ambassador to England, as well as spiritual leader to a denizen of devil worshippers, he is the target of an assassination plot by a group of priests led by Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi). Damien keeps busy thwarting his would be assassins, usually by consigning them to a brutal demise. He also carries on a romance that ends badly. Damien is very much aware of who he is and where his destiny lies. He is also hell bent on destroying the Christ child, as it is only by doing so that he can survive and fulfill his destiny.<p>This is a relatively well acted film that suffers from a somewhat weak script. Sam Neill is well cast as the grownup Damien, giving a powerful performance. Rossano Brazzi is excellent as Father DeCarlo, the priest determined to end the stranglehold that the Antichrist has on the world. Composer Jerry Goldsmith contributes to the gothic atmosphere of the film with his chillingly creepy, musical score, just as he did in "The Omen" and in the first sequel. Due to its weak script, however, the film pales in comparison to its predecessors. <p>The DVD offers a commentary by the director, Graham Baker but little else by way of special features. It provides clarity of visuals and audio.</p></body></html>

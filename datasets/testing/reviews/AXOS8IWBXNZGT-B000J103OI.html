<meta name="summary" content="the devil made me watch it..."></head><body><p>I've been to and fro on Northwest so often recently, that I'm running out of movies to watch while in transit. So, I had been avoiding watching this film, until this most recent trip. I was pleasantly surprised...it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. The film centers on two characters, played by Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. MS does a fantasic job of playing the editor of a fashion magazine similar to Vogue, who is very much the dragon lady you might expect. AH does a great job of playing a young graduating journalist who falls into the fashion world as MS's assistant, and suffers accordingly, but then goes through a transformation that she doesn't really understand is going on at first, and then later is very unhappy with. I was expecting vacuous, but this film wasn't that.</p></body></html>

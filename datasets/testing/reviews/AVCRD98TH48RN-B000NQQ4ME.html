While "Apocalypto" doesn't quite reach the level of overall magnificence of Mel Gibson's "Braveheart", it frequently achieves greatness that equals many of that film's finer qualities.  The visual effects are outstanding, as is the glorious cinematography, and having a cast of unknowns portray a long-lost people from an epic, mysterious culture is a stroke of genius.  The cast is excellent.  If any "name" actor had been in this film it would have taken away from the effectiveness of the tribe as a whole, as a family.  The entire film is in subtitles, as the characters relate to one another in an ancient tongue, which is yet another effective dynamic for transporting the viewer to another time.  After seeing this film and "Letters from Iwo Jima", which is predominately subtitled, I jokingly related to friends that the best foreign films these days are coming out of Hollywood.  That was true until I experienced "Pan's Labyrinth", which is amazing!  As far as "Apocalypto" goes, most of the flaws are incredibly minor, the only parts that had me shaking my head were a few predictable plot elements that are eventually forgivable given the overall grandeur of the film as a whole.  As for the complaints about the excessive gore in "Apocalypto", it is used as part of the story not as a fetish of Mel Gibson, as so many critics claimed.  As far as that goes I found it to be completely hilarious when "Apocalypto" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup, thus backhanding every critic across the face who downgraded the film for its excessive gore.  For a large portion of the movie, at least an hour in total, there is a fantastic chase that will leave everyone breathless.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, both as entertainment and as an artistic endeavor from all concerned.  Bravo!</p></body></html>

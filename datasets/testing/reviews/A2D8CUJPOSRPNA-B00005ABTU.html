<meta name="summary" content="CARRIE--Horror and Drama in one classic film"></head><body><p>Though perhaps more of a drama than what passes for horror by today's standards, CARRIE stands out as one of the genre's finest moments, having been made in a decade that also saw other classic thrillers such as JAWS and HALLOWEEN.<p>Based on Stephen King's first novel, the film is in essence a character study revolving around a socially repressed high school student (Sissy Spacek) who is tormented at school by her uncaring peers and at home by a religiously fanatical mother (Piper Laurie).  She soon discovers, however, that she has telekinetic powers; and when a horrible prank is pulled on her during the school's senior prom, those powers are unleashed with horrible and tragic results.<p>Brian De Palma's superb, Hitchcock-inspired direction mostly avoids the blood and gore until the bitter end; even the nightmarish prom scene is never explicit in its violence.  But CARRIE really succeeds as both horror and drama because of Spacek's incredibly devastating performance in the title role.  We sympathize with her situation, even as we shudder at the kind of horror she causes in the finale.  Her performance got her nominated for a Best Actress Oscar in 1976 and it can be argued quite convincingly that she should have won.<p>For those who appreciate horror with a certain amount of drama, not to mention heart, CARRIE is essential, classic viewing.</p></body></html>

Its in the new releases and I have never heard of it." That is usually not good. I must say that the first time I saw it I thought it stunk. I thought the dialogue was just bad and I just couldn't get into it. But for some reason I got it at a good price on DVD and I gave it another shot. As I watched it the second, third, fourth and other times I came to find that I liked it more and more. I began appreciating the strange cadence of the dialogue in that it wasn't like anything else that I had heard. Also things that I thought would happen if it was a typical hollywood movie...didn't. Val Kilmer was very good at this strange kind of clunky, hard to ride style and script. William H. Macy and 'Al Bundy' were also in the cast. Ah, who knows, maybe I just like Val Kilmer cause with dialogue like, "why weren't you prepared?", "Where IS the girl" (repeated for what seemed like 20 times in the exact same way by different characters... "Where IS the girl", and " You don't want to go in the desert" and some pretty stupid immplausible concepts like the roadhouse/convict/deathrow inmate/cop killing scam and some plot holes... I don't know, maybe I just like Val Kilmer or maybe I convinced myself that I liked it. It just had a wierd different strange style.</p></body></html>

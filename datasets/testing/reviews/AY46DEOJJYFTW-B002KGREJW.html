<meta name="summary" content="perfect mix of comedy and angst.."></head><body><p>a road movie unlike the cheap thrills of RV or other junk like that..this movie aims higher then cheap laughs or happy feelings..there's a depth to it that earns every laugh you get and there are quite a few..a brilliant cast, led by Alan Arkin, the codgy old grandfather, Steve Carrel, the suicidal brother of Toni Collete, a mother trying to keep the family running, and frayed from it. The laughs do not start until after the family is on the road and headed to Cali for the lil Miss Sunshine contest, where Olive aspires to be a beauty queen. There's something wonderfully uplifting and heartwarming about this movie but not in your typical Hollywood bloated way, and laughs are real belly jumpers not those little chuckl laughs. Love it! Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

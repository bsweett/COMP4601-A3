<meta name="summary" content="A Really Bizarre Spectacle. Classic Tim Burton."></head><body><p>For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of "Beetlejuice" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, "Beetlejuice" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

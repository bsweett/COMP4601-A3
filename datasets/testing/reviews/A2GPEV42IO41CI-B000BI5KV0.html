Once there, they find mates and each couple produces a single egg.  The males protect the egg and baby chick while the females return to the sea to feed for a month.  The parents take turns babysitting until one day, they just turn and walk away, leaving the young alone.  Driven by instinct and hunger, the chicks march to the sea and  begin their lives as sea creatures.<br /><br />This is a lovely movie.  It doesn't show anything that hasn't been shown before, but the extreme close-ups and leisurely pacing makes it very satisfying, there is a lilting soundtrack, and Morgan Freeman's gentle and soothing narration is exceptional.  "March" is a thoroughly enjoyable family film and the extra features, showing how the filmmakers worked in the Antarctic are fun to watch.  I had avoided seeing this movie  because I expected lots of tragic scenes of predators gobbling up defenseless penguins, but, happily, that is minimalized.  Heartily recommended.</p></body></html>

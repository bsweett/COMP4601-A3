<meta name="summary" content="Something magical happens when Helen Mirren "becomes" Queen Elizabeth"></head><body><p>This 2006 film tells the story of those dark days in 1997 when Princess Diana was tragically killed in a car crash and the world mourned the loss.  Queen Elizabeth, however, did not react immediately.  Because of the scandal surrounding the Princess's divorce from Prince Charles, royal protocol ruled, and there was a conspicuous silence from Buckingham Palace.<br /><br />In the role that won her the Academy Award, Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth seems absolutely real. Something magical happens and she actually "becomes" her royal highness herself.  It's not just that she looks like her; it's much more than that.  She has mastered the accent, the nuances, and the fleeting emotion in a self-controlled countenance.  She is also humbled and confused but this only comes through in fleeting moments of personal soul searching.  Otherwise, she embodies proper behavior as befits the tradition of the monarchy.<br /><br />Michael Sheen is cast in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair and the early scenes depict his awkwardness in the presence of the Queen of England.  As the story progresses, however, he actually helps her to understand that the world has changed in the fifty years since she was crowned. This is all done very subtlety and I couldn't help be moved by the Queen's personal turmoil.<br /><br />There were strengths in the screenplay and but there were also weaknesses.  A lot of the story was told through newsreels that we have all seen over and over again.  Also, we know how it all played out.  And so I found myself a bit impatient at the slow pace.<br /><br />I do recommend this film as I think it shows a particular piece of history and some absolutely superb acting.  But it does drag on a bit so try not to be too sleepy when you see it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting plotline, minimal  special effects, but still a good Giamatti vehicale."></head><body><p>Having seen all the M. Night Shymalan films, I must say that his films are becoming less scary and more interesting at times. Lady in the Water is not really a horror or fantasy film like Sixth Sense and Signs, it's more of a supernatural thriller. There is a lot of good humorous moments delivered by the impeccable Paul Giamatti who finally gets a starring vehicle in a big budget show. The film is not very lavish in terms of sets and special effets, and the duration of the film is set inside and outside of a residential building. Very interesting swimming pool shape. The film has a good story-telling process, but it's not scary. It's funny and suspenseful, more than half of the film is dialogue driven. The creature makes a few brief mements, and didn't have the effect of a scene like the alien appearance in Signs. The supporting cast all turned in pretty good performance. Shymalan has writen quite a bit screentime of for himself. Cindy Cheung who plays the Korean neighbor has some stealing moments, but a few of the scenes of her opposite Giamatti is over her shoulder only without a reverse! Bryce Dallas Howard may appear on the poster exclusively, but her role has limited screentime compare to Giamatti, and it's not even as challenging as her blind girl character in The Village. I wished they had done more underwater scenes or give the viewers images of the "Blue World" where Story(The Lady) came from. Afterall, I don't see how this film costed $75 million to make. On another note, I was also surprised that Wong Kar Wai(2046)'s favorite cinamatographer Christopher Doyle got this gig, because it's not his style at all.</p></body></html>

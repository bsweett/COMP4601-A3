The story concerns a young pregnant girl who dies but the baby survives. A hospital worker discovers a Russian diary on the dead girl and uncovers a sinister Russian prostitution ring and befriends a Russian mobster who may or may not be able to help her. It is very dark material at times but turns out to be a surprisingly excellent film although excessive as Cronenberg's style usually is. If you like good drama and can tolerate the extreme violence then Eastern Promises just might be one of those films that actually tries to compete with what Coppola and Scorsese have put out there and does a remarkably good job of it.</p></body></html>

It took home five Academy Awards after its 1965 release, and continues to thrill audiences today with its superb musical performances, its touching story, and its fabulous location shooting in Austria.  This 40th anniversary two-disk edition offers a sharp, beautiful digitally remastered presentation, and loads of extras.<br /><br />The story is familiar to fans.  Once upon a time (in 1938), in the City of Salzberg deep in the Austrian Alps, a spirited young postulate named Maria is sent from her covent to be governess to the seven unruly children of a widowed and very strict Captain Von Trapp. Through pluck, compassion, and her ability to share her music, she captures the hearts of the children and enables them to re-capture the heart of their father.<br /><br />The movie has two climaxes.  The first comes when Maria and Captain Von Trapp must confront their unexpected feelings for each other.  The second comes when the Nazi take-over of Austria puts the Von Trapp family at risk.  In a thrilling conclusion, the family must dodge a Nazi dragnet and flee for their lives.<br /><br />The extras for this edition are quite remarkable, including the usual "making of" features that detail the lengthy backstory of the movie and the musical stage production that preceded it.  Co-stars Jule Andrews (Maria) and Christopher Plummer (Captain Von Trapp) provide delightful commentary.  Perhaps most interesting to this reviewer was the reunion of the actors who played the seven Von Trapp children.  They have some interesting stories about the long production of the movie in California and Austria.  Rehearsals and filming ran for months, during which the two boys grew several inches, two of the younger girls shed teeth, and all contributed to pranks and gaffs on and off set.<br /><br />"The Sound of Music" is very highly recommended as superb family entertainment that has stood the test of time and is even better in this refurbished edition.</p></body></html>

It's not a pretty sight. The first half of the movie could easily move you to tears, as Moore introduces us to many middle-class, insured citizens for whom the failure of Health Care ended in tragic results. Note that the focus is NOT on the almost 45 million citizens who don't have insurance, but on the citizens who, because they obediently pumped their money into monthly premiums, thought they were protected if things were to turn bad.<br /><br />Moore then finds former workers in the industry who admit their work with regrets, like the caseworker who describes how his job was to turn over as many rocks as possible in your past to make sure your claims could be declined. Or in one case, declined retroactively with a demand that YOU (the patient) make restitution. One of the major differences between "Sicko" and past Moore ventures, like "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DDVV">Bowling for Columbine</a>," is that there are no big name targets here. No CEO is backed into a corner and harangued with a camera. One of the cheif talking heads is little more than an old lion of the British Labour party, Tony Benn, who delivers the quote I used to headline this review (to a loud round of applause in the theater I watched "Sicko"). Benn and Che Guevara's daughter are maybe the most prominent names here, and that says a lot. This isn't about famous people or Charleton Heston. These are just everyday folks forced into impossible situations with little more than a rubber stamp to mortally wound them - as one very telling news-clip reveals. As such, this becomes some of Moore's best work.<br /><br />But then again, this is a Michael Moore movie, so there has to be some sort of grandstand. It comes when Moore loads a boat of seriously ill people on a trip to Cuba to point out that our "9/11 Heroes" are getting stuck with treatment worse than that of Al-Qaeda prisoners held in Guantanamo. Even more humiliating is watching how these people, denied all their government help merely because they weren't officially government employees, are left resorting to ticket raffles in the local corner bars of their neighborhoods. (To quote Bill Maher, "We call them heroes, but we treat them like chumps.")<br /><br />When Reggie, the female 9/11 worker with some sort of inflamed throat/lung issues, discovers that an inhalant that costs her $125 of her disability/SS pay goes for a nickle in Cuba is brought to tears, the obvious propaganda value the Cuban government saw in Moore's presence shakes the honesty of the scene. Which is something of the point...if a country that we despise so deeply and has such internal turmoil can keep a world-class medical system running for all its citizens for free, what then does this say about us? Especially when, in the film's next heartbreaking segment, we are forced to watch a recent silent security camera video of a patient pushed out of a taxi on Los Angeles' Skid Row with little more than a hospital gown because she would not result in a profit?<br /><br />I am one of many people who has medical-care nightmares to relate, none as tragic as those brought to light in Moore's "Sicko," but enough to have destroyed my credit rating for several years. When you contrast this to the Health Care employees who recount that they were given bonus incentives for the number of claims they denied (as opposed to the English Doctors who are given incentives for the number of patients they cure) and the amounts of money shown paid to Health Care CEOs, "Sicko" will make you think twice about that lingering queasiness viewing this movie can cause.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Looks a lot like old Wilson High"></head><body><p>You can have your "Sixteen Candles", "Rebel Without a Cause", and all the rest -- for my money, "Carrie" is the greatest film ever made about American High School.<br /><br />Released in November 1976, this high-octane adaptation of Stephen King's breakout horror novel is one of the mid/late-70s big releases that has aged exceptionally well. De Palma shot each scene with a pop-operatic sweep that he can proudly call his own. The teenagers in Carrie are nightmarish pigs, the environment a hellish American small town full of drunken homemakers and sadistic teachers.<br /><br />The material is absolutely perfect for De Palma's "Sisters"-era fireworks, as it builds up Carrie's sad and pathetic school life, her relationship with a freakish bible-thumping mother, and culminates in a Grand-Guignol bloodbath at the High School prom. Split-screens, overcranked cameras, dolly shots during gym practice...all this and more has been lifted in videos such as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and Hole's first album cover -- but no imitators have come close to making the same statement. "Poltergeist" ripped off the ending as well.<br /><br />I think Carrie is an interesting film to compare with John Carpenter's Halloween and his adaptation of Christine. In the former, everything is played for the slasher elements, and the teenage milieu is much more benign. It has none of the style or subtext of De Palma's film. Christine's best elements come across as an accomplished but somewhat imitative version of Carrie, complete with a John Travolta doppelganger for the villain.<br /><br />This is just one hell of a movie. De Palma did some other interesting work around this period but nothing else seems to have the same unity. And the Blu-Ray looks outstanding with the dream-like cinematography of Mario Tosi.</p></body></html>

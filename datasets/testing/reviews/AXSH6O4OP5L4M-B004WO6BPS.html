Each book speaks to a different age group in terms it can understand and does so in a vocabulary that stretches the growing reader without boring the mature reader to death.  Syntax gradually becomes more complex with each book, and the social issues faced at each age are presented realistically if not in the context of reality.  The plot structure is respected, with a beginning, middle and end that show continuity and respect for the reader.  Up until now, each of the films has also respected the story teller's art and the fictional work itself.  By these criteria, however, this installment of the film series is a dismal failure.<br /><br />The public relations for the film suggest that two parts were "required" to adequately present the book, but I disagree.  Two parts were necessary to adequately squeeze every last possible penny out of the franchise, and it is painfully obvious.  Part of the film maker's job is to translate the words and pages and the narrative episodes of a written work into a visual work that captures the story in a meaningful way, keeping the story on track by editing episodes where appropriate.  That doesn't seem to have happened here.  What we have is a meaningless bridge from the previous story to the d&eacute;nouement, a bridge we really didn't need and one that seems purposeless. The viewer ends up feeling like he took one of the stairways at Hogwarts, and it redirected him to a floor he hadn't intended on going to!<br /><br />The present film is more of a picture piece than a work of fiction.  Those who enjoy glorious filmography and natural settings will be pleased with the work, as it is definitely eye candy in this respect.  CGI buffs will also receive what they have come to expect by way of special effects in this series.  Those who have come to expect the drama of growing up into adulthood will be very disappointed.  The adult responsibilities and relationships, the personal losses, and the expectations of individuals against the grander background of world events that the final book portrays is somewhat lacking here.  There's a big build up, but nothing really happens that needs to have been enlarged on to the extent of a full 2 ? hour film.<br /><br />The young people have started on their search for the parts of Voldamort's soul stashed in various objects, but most of the film has them "camping out" in lovely locations while trying to come to some plan of action.  Quarrels ensue, separations result, true camaraderie wins out and everyone comes together again, but other than that, not very much happens that forwards the story.  We've already seen the tiny tent with the capacious interior, of which Hermione's purse is just another version.  We've already gotten used to the concept of invisibility; we know that magic can be deadly and wicked people do wicked things.  The story has no beginning, middle or end.  The film just seems to mark time.<br /><br />Anyone collecting the films will hardly miss this one if they choose to have only the second part.</p></body></html>

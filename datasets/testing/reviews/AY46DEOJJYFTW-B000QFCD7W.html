Good actors can take a bad script and make something out of it and that's what seems to happen here. There were a few genuine laughs we had from this film but all in all it was a bit disappointing. I was hoping it would be better then the standard Hollywood formulic script. With talent like this William Macy, Travolta, Tim Allen, Ray Liotta, Lawrence Martin and Academy Award Winner Marisa Tomei you expect more but too often the actors instead of working off of each other in a nice ensemble seem to be trying to outdoing each other and the whole thing just falls flat.</p></body></html>

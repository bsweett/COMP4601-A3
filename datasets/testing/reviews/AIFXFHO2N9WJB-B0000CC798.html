<meta name="summary" content="The Mutants Are Back and Better Than Ever..."></head><body><p>After the enormous success of "X-Men", Fox Studios couldn't wait to get director Bryan Singer back behind the camera on another adventure of Marvel's popular team of mutants.  Yet before going off half-cocked and just throwing a sequel together, several key elements must first come together. The first thing that is key to most sequels' success is getting the original film's cast back together, once that is accomplished a great script must be on hand that equals, and hopefully surpasses the original film's story, and third, the budget must always be better, especially for a film of this magnitude.  Luckily, Fox Studios and Bryan Singer accomplished all of this, and so audiences worldwide were presented with an incredible sequel with "X2: X-Men United".<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" basically picks up where "X-Men" left off, Wolverine is still searching for where he comes from, Magneto is still locked inside his plastic prison, Mystique is masquerading as Senator Kelly, and Professor Xavier and the rest of the X-Men are trying to ensure peace between humans and mutants.  This time though, the threat to humanity is not solely evil mutants, this time the threat is humanity, as a renegade general named, Stryker (Brian Cox), is determined to see all mutants dead or dying, and if some normal people get in the way, so be it.  The X-Men must gather together and team-up with Magneto and Mystique to stop this mutant massacre or all hope will be lost.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" gave audiences everything they loved about the original film, and more.  More action, an even bigger, more dramatic story, more special effects, and more mutants.  In "X2: X-Men United" audiences were introduced to the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), also Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro were given more screen time, and several other recognizable mutants made cameos; such as, Colossus, Siren, and Kitty Pryde.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" simply put, was just an incredible film, and built brilliantly on what "X-Men" had started.  Now all we can do is hope that when "X3" comes to theaters in 2006, it will carry on the already impressive legacy, that "X-Men" and "X2: X-Men United" has created.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and minor sensuality.</p></body></html>

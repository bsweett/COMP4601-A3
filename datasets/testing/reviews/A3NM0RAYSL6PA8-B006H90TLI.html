In fact, I didn't detect very much genius in it at all.  I found none of the characters terribly appealing or engaging, save for the sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones, and he was, at most, an attempted surrogate for the audience--bearing witness to the events of the film and emoting a combination of disbelief, chagrin, and shock.  The story was scattershot and barely engaging.  And what held it all together at all was a murderous character who seemed to be a superficial study in ruthlessness--a man who, in the relentless pursuit of money, gets to indulge a grim kick for gratuitous killing. Everyone knows that there are bloodless, heartless, and fiercely stoic maniacs in the world, and that there always have been.  In fact, in the kind of spoon-feeding I truly hate in movies, Tommy Lee Jones's character recounts a newspaper story about a brutal killing to unnecessarily drive home the point. The only question No Country for Old Men left on the table, at least for me, was, "So what?"  It's like Terminator told from the point of view of the machines--a heartless, relentless tale with nary a lesson in it apart from the obvious:  Don't mess with drug dealers because you're likely to find a kind of ruthlessness you've never imagined.  Not exactly rocket science, and not exactly unimaginable, since it's been done before in better movies, including The Professional.<br /><br />Part of the reason No Country for Old Men left me cold is that it seemed remarkably undecided as to its own message.  As a result, the critics have had a field day coming up with all manner of metaphors they believe inhabit the story and the characters.  I could find none.  At best, Javier Bardem's killer represented the kind of conscienceless, amoral persona that has become a rather common trigger point for fear and public panic. Not shaded by any empathy or concern for human life, he may be a representation of the modern, existential killing machine who is beyond reasoning with or avoiding--like the carjacker who kills the young mother after she tries to connect with him and provides details of the young children she will leave behind.  He is a predator unmoved, and perhaps even disgusted, by other human beings.  One monumental problem, however, is that No Country For Old Men provides no counterpoint for this. There is not a single character I cared about who came into the crossfire of Bardem's narcissistic psychopath.  In addition, since he mainly focuses his murderous rage on those who, to one degree or another, are culpable in the theft or attempted recovery of drug money, his persona lacks the cold-blooded arbitrariness of so many real killers that make the news.<br /><br />No Country for Old Men, in the end, is the cinematic equivalent of watching a shark feed.  As the movie wrapped up, I thought, maybe the one person spared by our homicidal shadow of a character might kill him in some unintended accident.  At least that would put a nihilistic smile on our faces at the end of this otherwise humorless dirge.</p></body></html>

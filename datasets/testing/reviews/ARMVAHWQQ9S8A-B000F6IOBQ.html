<meta name="summary" content="Not Very Much Story"></head><body><p>The Underworld franchise is an intriguing one.  The movies are visually beautiful, the concept is interesting, a prequel is about to be made, and most of the actors are exceptional.  The first Underworld movie suffered from a few plot holes, but Underworld Evolution simply doesn't have enough plot to have that many holes.  It does manage a few of them, though.<br /><br />In Underworld, it is established that there are three master vampires, each of whom have their turn to rule: Victor, Marcus, and Amelia.  Marcus and Victor have a rivalry, but if the vampires knew that Marcus would kill anyone who respected Victor when he was risen, why would they even consider raising him? And Marcus's motives are convoluted but never made clear, because he wants to kill Selene even after she says that she killed Victor (in the first movie, thus not a spoiler).  This is nonsensical, but it doesn't take away much from the movie.  The visual cinematography and Beckinsale's acting make sure of that.<br /><br />This movie is a lot shorter, sexier, and abrupt than the first one, and there aren't that many things happening.  In the least, it's easy to follow.<br /><br />7/10</p></body></html>

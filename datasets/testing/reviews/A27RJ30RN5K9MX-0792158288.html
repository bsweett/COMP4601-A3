However, the transfer on the films themselves is amazing! The picture and sound quality is so good, that it is almost unreal. This DVD set is truly a must buy for any fans of Indiana Jones or of action films in general.<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark<p>"Raiders of the Lost Ark" is the best film of the trilogy in my opinion. We get to see the loveable, bullwhip-cracking, archeologist Indiana Jones for the first time. Harrison Ford was the perfect choice for the role of Indiana Jones, and he gave the best performance of his career. Karen Allen is outstanding as Indy's love interest Marion Ravenwood. I love how she can powerdrink any man under the table, and actually gets involved in the story. Allen did not play the typical " damsel in distress" which made the role so good. Only Steven Spielberg could have created a masterpiece like "Raiders of the Lost Ark". The non stop action, special effects, overall story, and acting are all top notch. Indiana Jones is one of the most memorable characters to ever come out of Hollywood. <p>The Temple of Doom<p>"Temple of Doom" is obviously the second film of the trilogy. People often criticize this film very heavily. While it was not as good as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", it is still extremely enjoyable in my opinion. Steven Spielberg, despite the opinions of others, did a good job with this film. It is much darker than Raiders which makes it somewhat original. It is also funnier, and has some very suspenseful scenes! The one that comes to mind, is Indy and company jumping out of the plane on the raft, and sliding down the mountain. The action is non stop and the acting is good all around. Also, I love the visuals for this film. Underneath the palace in the caverns especially. You also get a first hand look at the wilderness of India. Temple of Doom is not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but still very enjoyable and fun to watch. Kate Capshaw was the film's only downfall, because she spends the majority of the film whining about bugs, getting wet, etc. Sometimes you just want Indy to tell her to shut up. Suprisingly, the film's best role behind Harrison Ford, Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round. He is mainly known for his role as Data in "The Goonies". This kid did an amazing job and will have you laughing for the majority of the film.<p>The Last Crusade<p>"The Last Crusade" is almost as good as "Raiders of the Lost Ark". The overall story, non stop action, and father/son relationship between Ford and Connery really make it a treat to watch. Harrison Ford is back for a third time, as the loveable bullwhip-cracking archeologist Indiana Jones, and he does a great job once again. The thing that I really love about this film, we get to see more than one side of the character and look into Indy's past. River Pheonix had a nice cameo as the young Indy. I liked how we got to see how Indiana Jones came to be. Sean Connery is one of Hollywood's true legends. He steps up and really nails the role of Henry Jones. His obsessive nature over the grail is great, and how can you not love the relationship between Indy and his dad. " I told you...don't call me Junior!!!"</p></body></html>

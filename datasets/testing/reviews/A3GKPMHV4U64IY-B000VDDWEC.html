<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant!"></head><body><p>This is one of the most gripping films I have seen in a long time.  No, it is not a mega-special-effects blockbuster like Armageddon, but a much more realistic story.<p>Animal rights activists ultimately destroy England when they release infected chimpanzees.  They are infected with Rage, an illness which drives the infected into a murderous rage when encountering someone not infected.<p>Jim wakes up in a hospital ala Day of the Triffids.  He wanders an empty London trying to figure out if he is hallucinating or not.  The Empty London and contact with a pair of other survivors shows shades of The Quiet Earth.<p>Soon reality sets in for Jim as he and his companions in survival search for others.  They eventually wind up at a country estate fortified in a manner similar to The Omega Man.<p>The story explores some interesting concepts including the key issue of what do you offer people when all hope is lost so that suicide is not a viable answer.  How can hope be resurrected?<p>The changes Jim goes through are very well done.  He starts confused and dazed, moves to mild acceptance, continues to belief and ultimately becomes a resourceful survivor.<p>The DVD contains a number of deleted scenes, the original ending (which I liked), another alternate ending and an extremely alternate ending where the second half of the film follows a completely different path.<p>This is not a teen horror film like Scream or Halloween, but one that relies more on fear and atmosphere like the original The Haunting.  Excellent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good summer fun"></head><body><p>This 2008 rendering of The Incredible Hulk makes for good summer fun. It has a hero you can like, a girlfriend you can like even more, and bad guys you can feel good about disliking. The hero, of course, is Bruce Banner, a basically nice guy, a scientist, living life on the run. He has plenty to run from and that includes himself - but, for once, he's winning that part of the race. Liv Tyler brings girlfriend Betty to life as a strong, loving character with Tyler's unique kind of good looks. The bad guys include a military nutjob who wants to own Banner and another military nutjob who wants to be Banner.<br /><br />This Hulk had a lot to live down, because of unfortunate previous attempts at bringing the green guy to the screen. It does a fair job, too, largely because of up-to-date effects. This does have its own problems, though, like the ridiculous efforts at military action to capture The Hulk - the same efforts, again and again, no matter how often they fail. Well, maybe that is realistic.<br /><br />This time, Marvel has put its creative efforts into a fair piece of summer movie entertainment. I found it pretty forgettable, except for that sequel-bait at the end, so wait for a hot day, then sit back and enjoy the popcorn, the air conditioning, and the movie.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

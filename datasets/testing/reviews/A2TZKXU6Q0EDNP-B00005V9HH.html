The "Usual Suspects" has the definition of a great script. It keeps you guessing until literally the very last minute when it leaves you in awe. Story twists and state-of-the-art mind games are dominant throughout while parts of the story could actually be separate films alltogether.<br />  A big heist involving 5 former convicts, a mysterious underground lord called "Keyser Sose", and the story being told in retrospect by "Verbal" (Kevin Spacey), a cripple who is interrogated by a top cop (Palminteri) is the basic outline.<br />  As you try to make sense out of what "verbal" says (while the "facts" keep constantly changing and "verbal" keeps adjusting his story according to the new clues coming in) the mind game keeps climaxing and the myth about Keyser Sose elevates to incredible manipulations. In fact, the basic theme of the film is "who is Keyser Sose"? And, exactly because "Keyser" could be any of a number of "suspects", he could be dead, or he might not even exist the intrigue remains intact till the end.<br />  And what an end this is. Possibly one of the most ingenius film-endings ever on celluloid, one not to give away if you are a true fan of the "Usual suspects" or a true fan of cinema.<br />  But the positives don't stop there. Kevin Spacey doesn't simply give yet another solid performance, he gives a trademark performance, one that many a character have since been based-on on film and doubtlessly more are to follow as the character of "Verbal" is sharply inspiring.<br />  But then every character in the film has dynamic abilities, every character contributes as a corridor to the endless labyrinth of clues you are trying to collect as you watch. Gabriel Byrne and Del Toro, Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Pollack as well as Palminteri are all in superb form here. The second time I watched this film it became very obvious that all the actors loved being in this stunning flick. No wonder.<br />  The director falls not short either, he lets the characters lead and he does his part in setting up the scenery where the elusive Keyser Sose can "exist". A scenery dark and intimidating like the character in question. The main element is the fear everyone seems to out over "Sose" but at the same time noone knows for sure what he does or what he is. The most clues are given, perhaps, by Keyser's "right hand" the enigmatic "Mr. Kobayashi" who serves also as a guide to Sose's power for the viewers.<br />Mindblowing film. Puts the "C" into classic.</p></body></html>

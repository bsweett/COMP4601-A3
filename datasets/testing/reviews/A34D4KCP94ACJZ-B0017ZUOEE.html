<meta name="summary" content="Compelling Story with Great Suspense"></head><body><p>The Orphanage or El orfanato is a horror film directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and produced by one of the most creative filmmakers around today, Guillermo del Toro (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WSLAUO">Pan's Labyrinth</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OT6V00">Hellboy</a>).  I was just having a conversation with my brother the other day about horror films and how I often, unintentionally perhaps, rate them on a scale.  In other words, a four or five star horror film is probably not the same as a four or five star drama in most cases.  The Orphanage really is a four star movie because it is more than your typical horror fare.  Let's call it a supernatural thriller instead.  It was nominated for 14 Goya Awards and won seven.<br /><br />The film opens at an orphanage and we briefly see young Laura find out that she is leaving.  Years later and Laura decides to return by actually buying and living in the orphanage with her husband Carlos and her son Sim&oacute;n.  Sim&oacute;n makes several imaginary friends and the plot unfolds with a series of effective and believable twists and turns.  It would be a mistake to give anything else away here.<br /><br />It really is impressive how far a film like this can go with good acting, smart writing, and solid suspense.  After the movie was over I realized that the twists were unpredictable to me because I wasn't waiting to find out what they were.  I was preoccupied with an engaging screenplay and atmosphere.  I actually cared about the characters too much to focus on forecasting the secrets.  The Orphanage made me excited to go along for the ride without even realizing.  Bayona had me trust his film at just the right times and for that I was caught off guard, and the film's surprises were far more rewarding.<br /><br />While watching this movie I kept thinking of films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783116926">The Changeling</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CYLJ">The Others</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY">The Sixth Sense</a>, or even del Toro's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000274TLW">The Devil's Backbone</a>.  I probably think of those movies not just because they are like-minded supernatural thrillers but because they are impeccably well crafted films.  I give The Orphanage a very high recommendation and it is probably the best movie of its kind from 2007.</p></body></html>

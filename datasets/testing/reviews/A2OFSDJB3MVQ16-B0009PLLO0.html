<meta name="summary" content="Stone's flawed "Alexander" still worth seeing"></head><body><p>Althought I had seen this film on the big screen and though it received indifferent reviews, it's still worth seeing in High-Definition. I bought this at a premium price in HD DVD and the quality is so astounding that I'm willing to forgive the flaws in Stone's epic.  Among them is the casting of Colin Farrell, who though not terribly bad, tends to overplay his scenes as Alexander yet other roles come out better such as Jolie's manipulative mother and Kilmer as Philip, the lustful father.  Also as inviting as the scenery and battle scenes is the luscious, exotic Rosario Dawson as Roxanne, the Persian beauty that Alexander claims but loses.  The seduction scenes between her and Farrell really kept my blood rolling as I watched it!!  At least this film is a big improvement over the boring, talky 1955 version with Richard Burton and Frederic March!!  As Stone states in his introduction for those who hated the film--you will probably hate it more in this version.  But for those of you who did admire this flawed masterpiece (it did much better in Europe than here!!) in the theater--you'll love the riches Stone has added to this version.  Definitely worth seeing in HD DVD or Blu-ray!!</p></body></html>

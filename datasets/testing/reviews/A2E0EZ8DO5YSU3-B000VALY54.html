But time is not always that kind and in this movie we have a collection of actors who just look awful compared to our memories of 30 years ago.  If we had never seen them when they were young, it probably wouldn't bother us that this or that character looks burnt-out or bloated or bald.  But since we do remember what they used to look like, it is hard to not be distracted from the story by thinking how awful they look now.</p></body></html>

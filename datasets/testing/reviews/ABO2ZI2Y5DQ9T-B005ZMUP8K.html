<meta name="summary" content="Long Entertaining Teaser for the Next Seqeul"></head><body><p>The second `Pirates of the Caribbean' is actually a very long (2 h 31 m) and costly teaser for the next entry that will be released in 2007. I don't mean to say the first sequel has no merits. It is fair to say that this film is entertaining enough with so many adventures, but at the same time I'm afraid that the magic that worked in the original is almost gone ... for now.<br /><br />The weakest point of the `Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' is obvious from the very beginning. It is the script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, who attempt to draw a bigger picture than it should be, trying to contain as many elements as possible. The basic story is about pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, good as ever) and Davy Jones (unrecognizable Bill Nighy), the latter claiming Jack's soul for an old contract.<br /><br />Besides that, there is another plot about the parenthood of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), less memorable character from the first film. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) also comes back, together with Norrington (Jack Davenport) a forgettable character that few people would remember. So many characters are crammed into the 150-minute film, and you will never see the point of the story unless you have seen the original. Or maybe you won't if you have.<br /><br />The good news is Jack Sparrow (for which Johnny Depp was Oscar-nominated) retains his amusing eccentricity. Depp's interpretation of the character as rock-and-roll version of pirate is still the most attractive part of the series, and probably will be. Some delightful characters are back such as the comic duo of Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook), both funny as before.<br /><br />Except for some set-pieces (like Jack's `fruits-throwing' sequences, funny slapstick), the second `Pirates' film has lost the unpredictability and originality of the first one. The film looks great, and entertaining as a whole, but is a letdown when seen beside the original. Let's wait for the next entry and what Chow Yun-Fat can do.</p></body></html>

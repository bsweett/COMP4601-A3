After seeing him on &quot;That 70's Show,&quot; &quot;Punk'D&quot; and the deliciously stupid &quot;Dude Where's My Car?&quot; I was ready to see what the serious side of him could bring to the table. What I got with this film is more than I had bargained for. Sure, the previews promised a lot (and delivered on it), but this film is one of the most intense and gripping movies I have seen in a long time. First time directors  J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress do an outstanding job with the material, and although the initial premise is far-fetched, it's forgiven because of how the story sucks you in and makes you feel involved. Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a college student with a dark past, who can't remember key moments in his life because he simply blacked them out. He is told his dad is crazy, and as a child, sees him die. Evan's doctor told him to start writing journals when he was seven years old and when he reads a passage in the present day about a moment that he blacked out, he finds himself in a dream-like state where he is reliving the moment he couldn't remember. After a few experiences, Evan figures he can control these dreams and try to change things and maybe create a better future for him and his three childhood friends: Tommy (William Lee Scott), Lenny (Elden Henson) and most importantly, the girl he has loved since as long as he can remember (Tommy's twin sister) Kayleigh (Amy Smart). However, everytime Evan goes back in time, things in the present get shifted around severely, and most of the time, end up the worst. Evan finds himself going from frathouse to prison to wheelchair and each time he experiments, his window of hope for saving his friends seems to be waning. The most powerful scenes involve Evan's childhood, where we slowly watch how deranged Tommy can get, how disturbed Lenny can get, and how messed up Kayleigh's life can get. All of the actors in this film turn out exceptional performances. Obviously Kutcher does a great job, and is natural as Evan. But props must go to the underrated Amy Smart, who plays so many different characters in this movie and covers so much area. You can tell she put a lot into the role and it translates onto the screen. The movie (well, the theatrical cut) revolves around the love-story between Evan and Kayleigh, and basically serves as Evan's motivation. This movie is a bit disturbing, if you have certain childhood scars that you would rather not bring up, I wouldn't recommend this movie. But the bottom-line is &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; is a great movie and exceeds all expectations. The Director's Cut found on this DVD, is basically the original movie, with some cut-scenes pasted here and there (and it's easy to see why some of these were cut) and a completely different ending. Personally, I liked the original ending better. It just seems to end perfectly, exactly the way it should. But The Director's Cut, while being risky and bold, just doesn't seem to fit. But, it's all open for interpretation. The extras are somewhat disappointing. The extra deleted scenes are always nice and the commentary from the directors is rather interesting, but there isn't much else going on.</p></body></html>

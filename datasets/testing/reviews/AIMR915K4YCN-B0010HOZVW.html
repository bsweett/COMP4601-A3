<meta name="summary" content="Angel Of Death..."></head><body><p>Jodie Foster (Taxi Driver, Silence Of The Lambs, Panic Room, Flight Plan) has really hit her stride w/ these thrillers. In THE BRAVE ONE, she takes on the role of radio-personality turned vigilante w/ ease and cool lethality. At first, I thought this was going to be some sort of DEATH WISH re-tread. Nope, TBO is a story about the ultimate cost of revenge. The toll that vengeance takes on the avenger in the form of a new inner deadness and freezing of one's own soul. While the scumbags who get their due are certainly deserving of their fate, Erica must go deeper into the abyss w/ each execution. The price of becoming an angel of death is extremely high. Ms. Foster brings authenticity and anguish to the part of Erica Bain. I found myself pitying her, while at the same time hoping she would get the satisfaction that she was willing to kill and die for. As a Jodie fan for some 30+ years (I fell in love w/ her character in The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane back in the 70s), I consider this to be one of her best performances. Terrence Howard is also great as the cop who finds himself torn between his sense of morality / duty, and his growing  understanding of / respect for the motive that drives this street-avenger. I must admit that I did not see the final&eacute; coming! I was surprised by it. I was even more surprised by my own gleeful reaction to it! Watch it and you'll see what I mean...</p></body></html>

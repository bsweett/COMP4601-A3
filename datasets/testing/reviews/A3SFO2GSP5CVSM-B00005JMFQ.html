<meta name="summary" content="Good little film"></head><body><p>The start and end of the film takes place at Heathrow, where a montage of people being greeted by their loved ones is lent poignancy by the opening narration of Hugh Grant stating that all the known messages left by the people who died on the 9/11 airplanes were messages of love and not hate, and the closing song of the Beach Boys' God Only Knows. Also effective is the use of cameos in the film, most notably as dream babes such as Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards, and Shannon Elizabeth make brief appearances in the airport as love interests for some of the diverse characters, who we see now have known each other in casual ways, each with different takes on love.<br />  Is Love Actually a film that will challenge you the way 2001: A Space Odyssey does? No. But it is a film whose well-written and acted characters and charm will stick in your mind long after their counterparts from lesser, schmaltzier films in its genre have faded.</p></body></html>

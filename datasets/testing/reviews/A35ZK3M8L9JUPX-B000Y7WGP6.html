<meta name="summary" content="The Kingdom"></head><body><p>A team of U.S. government agents is sent to investigate the bombing of an American facility in the Middle East. There is much to like in The Kingdom. Nice performances, a slightly-new take on the buddy-cop story. There is a big terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia. Some FBI agents led by Jamie Foxx, fast talk and bamboozle their way into the country to investigate, where they team up with two Saudi cops. There then follows a small amount of detective work, some interesting political manoeuvring and two really rather well-done shoot outs.</p></body></html>

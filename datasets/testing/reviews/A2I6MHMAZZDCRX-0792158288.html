<meta name="summary" content="Action!  Adventure!  Indy!"></head><body><p>This four disc set contains three classic action movies and one disc loaded with bonus material.<br /><br />Up first is "Raiders of the Lost Ark."  In it, we meet our hero, archeology professor Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford).  Indiana isn't just a classroom professor.  When the right opportunity presents itself, he heads out to the field in search of some priceless artifact.  This particular time, he's searching for the Jewish Ark of the Covenant.  But he's not the only one on the trail.  He has to race the Nazi's around the world to uncover its hiding place.<br /><br />Next is "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."  Set a couple years before the first movie, Indiana gets stranded in India when an attempt to sell his latest find goes bad.  The only way the locals will give him directions out of there is if he retrieves their sacred rock from a nearby temple where a cult uses it in some horrid practices.<br /><br />Finally comes "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."  When Indiana's father (Sean Connery) goes missing, it's up to Indiana to find him and the Holy Grail before the Nazis do.<br /><br />All three of these movies are fun.  They are filled with lots of action, yet the story holds together.  "Raiders" is easily the best of the series.  Everything was fresh and new here.  "Temple of Doom" is the weakest of the lot.  It is darker in tone and the story wanders a bit more.  Things definitely improve with "Last Crusade."  Sean Connery is funny as Indy's dad, and that dynamic makes it seem fresh again.<br /><br />For years, this set has been the only way to get the classic trilogy on DVD.  And that's not a bad thing.  Each movie gets its own disc.  The set came in both widescreen and full frame editions.  I have the widescreen, and the picture looks great.  The sound is wonderful as well.  All the extras are on the fourth disc.  And all the features are new.  The highlight is the two hour documentary on the making of the trilogy.  There's plenty of behind the scenes information here.  There are also four featurettes that focus more on the music, special effects, stunts, and sound effects.<br /><br />These movies are pure fun, and that's all they were trying to be.  So if you are looking for a good time at the movies, look up Indiana.  And if you are a fan, you'll be quite satisfied with this set.</p></body></html>

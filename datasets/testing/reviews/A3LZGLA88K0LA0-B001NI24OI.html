<meta name="summary" content="THE PERFECT TEAM"></head><body><p>As Coach Billy Bob Thornton tells his players, being perfect is not about winning, it's about playing for the other players, and doing the best you can.  With that in mind, director Peter Berg's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a perfect sports movie.  If you're not a football fanatic (which I am not), it becomes mystical as to how a sport can be such a religious experience for small towns.  Stores close down for games; everyone tries to tell the coach how to coach; what should be a carefree bunch of 17 year old boys becomes a collection of sour-faced, fatalistic young men who fear that if they don't win the state championship, their lives have no meaning.  One of the most disturbing lines in the film comes from the voice of a radio sportscaster who is chiding the coach for playing an injured player, and he adds, "There's too much learning in schools."  How sad that students are judged not on their academic merits, but how well they catch or throw a pigskin.  While I certainly recognize the need for athletics in school, the fanaticism exhibited in movies like this can only reinforce how overemphasized it can be.  And how violent and mean.  Players intentionally try to hurt other players, and the adults become like children in their overzealous attempts to relive their lives through these spirited boys.<br /><br />As a movie, though, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS works because of the extremely talented cast Berg was fortunate enough to come up with.  Thornton is brilliant as the coach, who feels his whole coaching career rides on winning this big game; all of the boys are superb, but special notice should be given to Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund and Jay Hernandez.  Their heart and soul provides the true foundation of the movie's team.  Derek Luke as Boobie strikes a one note performance until his wonderful scene where he breaks down and says he doesn't know how to do anything but play football.  (Another sign of the academic system's failure to promote education as well as sports).  And of course, the surprisingly effective performance of country singer Tim McGraw as the brutal father whose own upbringing echoes in the sad treatment of his son who just can't seem to hold on to the ball.  It's a brave performance for this superstar:  he struts around shirtless, without the kind of physique one would expect; he doesn't mind playing a sleazeball to contradict his heroic status in the country music market.  He's very good and should try some more roles in the future.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of heart and it's ending only reinforces how unfair life can be sometimes.  If you are a football fanatic, this movie should be right up your alley, but if you're not one, you should still appreciate the immense amount of effort our young boys put into the sport, and how being perfect can make it better.</p></body></html>

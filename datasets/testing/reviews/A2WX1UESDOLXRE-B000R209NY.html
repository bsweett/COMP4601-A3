So much so, that during a particularly thrilling sequence in the middle of the movie, in which all the characters are racing up a very tight air conditioner vent to avoid the rising water, that I almost vomitted. Perhaps it had to do with the massive amount of popcorn I inhaled during the previews. Nonetheless, the movie was extremely thrilling and I had such a blast, a bigger blast than watching The Da Vinci Code (which was less thriller and more mystery). I love to begin the summer movie season with an excellent thriller!!<br /><br />Poseidon boasts an all-star cast, including Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and the heartthrob Josh Lucas, incredible special effects, and decent performances all around. Here's the story, in short, a giant wave crashes into a luxury oceanliner, killing everyone on board, except a precious few who defy captain's orders and manage to wriggle and run their way through the destroyed, and upside down floating, oceanliner. Each character is key in some way, performing a "thank God we have this person on board" action at some point during the movie.<br /><br />When the captain spies that giant wave coming at the cruiseliner, you'll instantly grab your seat in shock and awe. Because it's a giant wave. And it's much more impressive this time around than in the original. In comparison to the new version, the original is, well, dull and slow, with crappy special effects, and sappy perfomances. This Poseidon is a much better effort, and you won't be sorry that you went to see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Upside to This Year's Movies"></head><body><p>Life doesn't come with an instruction manual or a script to follow, it's basically improv on a daily basis, and as it plays out people and things often are not who or what they seem to be on the surface.  It's reality, as opposed to the way you expect, hope or want it all to be; truth, as opposed to an individual perception of truth.  That's life.  And "The Upside of Anger," written and directed by Mike Binder, explores some hard realities that differ drastically from expectations and perceptions.<br /><br />The film opens with a funeral, a somber note which in a sense prepares you for what is to follow, after a flash back of three years, at which point the story begins.  Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) is at loose ends because her husband has run off with his secretary, leaving her and four daughters behind to fend for themselves.  Angry, distraught and a stone's throw from bitter, Terry turns to alcohol to deaden the effects of what has been a life-altering experience.  Luckily-- or maybe not-- Terry has a neighbor, Denny Davies (Kevin Costner), an ex-pro baseball player turned radio talk show host, with whom to share a drink and commiserate.  Her daughters (three teens and one in college) are supportive, as well-- to a point.  But they are each in their own way also struggling to understand why their father deserted them.  By all accounts, this was in no way a dysfunctional, angst-ridden family, so the actions of their father is a mystery to them all.  Naturally, it's a pivotal point in their lives, and before any of them can move on, especially Terry, they have to know why he did what he did.  In the meantime, with or without this needed closure, life is happening to and around them.<br /><br />Binder (who also appears in the film as the producer of Denny's radio show) displays an astute knowledge of human nature with this film, and how random the myriad twists and turns of life can be.  He holds your attention from the opening scene (who's funeral is it, anyway?), and just when you think you know where the story is going it takes an unexpected turn.  And he is in no way attempting to manipulate his audience; rather, he is giving you a reflection of the way life so often simply does not go the way you think it's going to.  It's a succinct look at relationships, and of how fragile-- as well as resilient-- we all can be.<br /><br />As Terry, Joan Allen sets vanity aside to create her character and turns in an Oscar caliber performance in doing so.  When she gets up in the morning she looks like a middle-aged woman with insufferable problems and a hangover, a woman in the throes of coping with a traumatic experience who is desperate to reconnect with a life she no longer has and who will do anything within her power to hang on to what she has left.  She's walking a tightrope over a deep abyss and she's understandably on edge, so when one of her girls tugs the rope and compromises her control and security, she quite naturally lashes out, proving the old adage you always hurt the one you love.  There's a scene in which a grieving Terry draws her hands to her breast and, head lowered, utters a cry, and anyone who has ever known any kind of grief or loss in their life will at that moment know exactly what she is going through.  It's a terrific piece of acting, a performance that is altogether affecting and memorable.<br /><br />And, as performances go, Kevin Costner, too, puts vanity aside to create a character that is entirely convincing.  Denny Davies is paunchy, his hair is thin and most of the time he looks as though he's had one beer too many.  Still, he's engaging, and you get the feeling there's a complex individual hiding behind an external simplicity that perhaps helps to mask his true feelings about a lot of things in his life, including his career on the diamond.  Why, for example, does he refuse to talk about baseball on his sports talk show?  In it's purity, this is arguably Costner's finest performance ever.<br /><br />Top notch performances are turned in, as well, by Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt as Terry's daughters, respectively, Andy, Popeye, Emily and Hadley; and by Binder himself as Shep.  In the end, "The Upside of Anger" is an involving, memorable film that celebrates life and leaves you with a sense of hope, that no matter how bad things get we all have the capacity to get through it and somehow find the light at the end of the tunnel.  And that's the magic of the movies.</p></body></html>

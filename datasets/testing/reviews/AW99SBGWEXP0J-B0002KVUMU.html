<meta name="summary" content="Van Helsing"></head><body><p>With the Success of "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns", it was no surprise that Universal Pictures gave writer/director Stephen Sommers the green light to use the big three: Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster, in a big budget action/horror movie.  And while "Van Helsing" is more action and less horror, it is still an entertaining ride.<p>Van Helsing (Jackman) is a monster hunter that secretly works for a religious organization that polices the supernatural.  He is sent to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula (Roxburgh).  Dracula is searching for Frankenstein's monster, because he holds the key to bringing Dracula's evil spawn to life.  Aided by a local vampire hunter by the name of Anna (Beckinsale), they venture forth to stop the evil blood sucker.<p>"Van Helsing" is a very loud movie that is relentless in its action.  There is very little down time for the viewer to catch his breath.  While that would be good in a shorter movie, at 135 minutes it is a bit tiring.  The special effects are on par with the Mummy movies, that is to say, good but not great, and that suits the tone of the movie just fine.  "Van Helsing" is a great start to the summer blockbuster season.</p></body></html>

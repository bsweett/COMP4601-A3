<meta name="summary" content="exciting sea adventure"></head><body><p>Peter Weir directs this high seas adventure with skill and a great eye; the film received an Academy Award for cinematography, and the action and effects are terrific.  Russell Crowe stars as Lucky Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany is his friend and ship's surgeon as the ship battles a French phantom ship in this adaptation of Patrick O'Brian's series of books.  Some liberties are taken with the books, probably wisely; for instance, the protagonists battle the French during the Napoleonic wars rather than fighting the Americans in 1812.  Max Pirkis is excellent as a young seaman, and Billy Boyd does well in a small part as the crew fights for, and admires, their inspirational captain.  Sometimes the language is difficult to understand, so it helps to watch with the subtitles on.  There is some gore in the battle scenes and aftermath, but there is humor as well.  The film can be heard in English, French or Spanish, with optional English or Spanish subtitles.</p></body></html>

This is truly a beautiful story of sacrifices made for the love of two people as well as the love of a country. The intrigue comes in when the viewers have to figure out which of the tale is the truth. Overall the story unfolds in a flurry of cinematographic magic and martial arts fantasy.</p></body></html>

One of a kind, written well and the actors were all top-notch.  Well, here we are with "Meet The Frockers", and that is all we really need; Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. Of course, a little Robert DeNiro thrown in to contrast with Ben Stiller and you have a win of a movie.<br /><br />Ben Stiller, Gaylord Frocker, yes, that's his name and that is the funniest line he has. Gaylord is engaged to be married to Jack and Dina Byrne's ( Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner)daughter. They are embarking on a trip to Florida to "Meet the Frockers", Roz and Bernie; Bar and Dustin. The Byrnes have a large, very large RV, and they are also bringing their infant grandson who is being brought up the Byrnes way.  There you have it, most of the movie in that little capsule.<br /><br />Dustin and Barbra have such great chemistry and funny lines, that you really only need to follow them. Barbra is a sex therapist, charading as a psychologist for the Byrne's sake, and Dustin is a stay at home dad, and used to be lawyer. They are fun and full of hi-jinks. Dustin Hoffman is a funny man. He is rowdy and raunchy. He could carry the movie alone, and well, quite frankly, he does.  I felt a sense of deja vous with this pair, even though neither has played this kind of part before.<br /><br />Ben Stiller has a comic sense of timing and carries this movie well, but not well enough. His fianc&eacute;e is ok, but looks too old for our Ben. All in all this movie has been done before. Still I laughed a lot, which is a good thing to say when watching a movie now a days. So, I am giving it a higher rank than most.  Laughter is worth a lot these days.<br />Recommended. prisrob</p></body></html>

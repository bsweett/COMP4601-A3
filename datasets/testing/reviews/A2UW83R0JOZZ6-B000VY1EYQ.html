Writer and director Adrienne Shelly wrote the screenplay for the film whilst pregnant with her first child Sophie and began filming in November of `05.  Principal photography wrapped three days before Christmas, a mere twenty days after it began.  With an overall budget of $2 million and Shelly directing and starring in the film while looking after her infant daughter with her husband Andy, she was a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Sadly, Shelly would never see the film to its fruition.  Only a year after "Waitress" began filming, she was murdered by a young Ecuadorian immigrant in her Manhattan home, leaving behind Andy, Sophie and a film career that might've been.  She was forty years old.  "Waitress" is Shelly's swan song, a work that would've opened people's eyes to her talents as a screenwriter and a film director.  It is unfortunate that she will only be appreciated now posthumously.<br /><br />The film begins with Jenna Hunterson (Russell) doing what she does best - making pies.  The kitchen is her oasis, a place where her sweet machinations come to life in the form of pies, quiches and tarts.  Her saccharine creations distract from the awful monotony of her life as a waitress at Joe's Pie Diner, not to mention an unwanted pregnancy for which her jerk of a husband Earl (Sisto) is responsible.  After a pregnancy test comes out positive, she makes an appointment with her family doctor only to discover she has left the practice and been replaced by Dr. Jim Pomatter (Fillion).  Unhappily married and unhappily pregnant more so, she begins having an affair with - of all people - her obstetrician.  Dr. Pomatter (whom she insists on calling by his professional name, even while she is sleeping with him) is a nervous and bumbling sweetheart who also happens to be married and he and Jenna literally stumble into love.  No sooner does she realize she's falling in love, Jenna starts pouring her passions into her pies, much in the same way that Tita did in "Like Water For Chocolate" ("Naughty Pumpkin Pie").  All the while, Jenna grows ever larger and tries to plan her escape from Earl's clutches and take her pie-making to the next level while amusing herself with the romantic hang-ups of her co-workers Dawn (Shelly) and Becky (Hines) and putting up with persnickety Joe (Griffith), the diner's aging proprietor.<br /><br />There isn't even one bad performance here, no matter how small the part.  The standouts, of course, are Russell and the seasoned and celebrated Andy Griffith as Joe.  Russell's Jenna is almost a tragic heroine - poor but not broken, she is kind but willful, a seemingly meek woman with an irrepressible spirit.  Russell embodies her character physically and emotionally - her Jenna is heartbreakingly lovely inside and out, a petite beauty who is sad but resolute ("...though she be but little, she is fierce") and has an admirably acidic sense of humor to boot.  Who else's sense of humor can also be admired is Griffith's curmudgeon Joe, one who cackles as he says that he "loves living vicariously through the pain and suffering of others."<br /><br />Sisto's Earl is a possessive jerk, a low-scale tyrant who underneath is incredibly insecure and needs constant reassurance of Jenna's commitment to him. Fillion's awkward Dr. Pomatter is completely endearing and the surrounding cast rounds out the wonderfully entertaining ensemble.  Dry humor is speckled throughout to keep this somewhat trifling tale from getting too sickly sweet, especially after Jenna's first rendezvous with Dr. Pomatter when Joe (Griffith) points out her smeared lipstick and tells her to "wipe away her indiscretions" before serving him breakfast.<br /><br />For a small film, it has big potential.  If you peruse the shelves of Blockbuster as much as I, don't let this fantastic sleeper get lost among the big-budget bull. Rent it and let it wrap you up like a warm blanket.<br /><br />"Gonna make a pie with a heart in the middle..."</p></body></html>

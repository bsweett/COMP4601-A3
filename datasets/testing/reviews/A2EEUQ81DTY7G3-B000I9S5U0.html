Braddock, star New Jersey boxer with all the bluster and charisma that he can muster. It's an absolutely astounding performance, easily the best of the year and a guaranteed sure bet for the gold statuette for best actor.<br /><br />Director, Ron Howard unashamedly transports us to the great depression, an era of soup lines, of frayed, tattered folks just trying to survive, and makeshift shantytowns, where men were lined with the unassailable grief of living and trying to make do. It's a story of hope and survival as Braddock rises from the ashes of misfortune to become, once again, a championship boxer, reflecting the dreams of not only his family but of all working class America.<br /><br />The film opens in the 1920's when the successful Braddock is living a life of privilege with his loving wife Mae (Renee Zellweger). They have three adorable young kids and a devoted coach/manager Jake Gould (Paul Giamatti), who always looks out for them. But Braddock's descent begins fast.<br /><br />The stock market crash in the late 1920's leaves him broke; then he injures his hand in a match, and gets disqualified from the ring for slacking off. Times are tough, with the family forced to live in a basement tenement and scrounge for odd jobs. Living basically hand-to-mouth, sometimes without electricity and heat, the Braddock family hit rock bottom.<br /><br />Imbued with a kind of spiritual optimism, Braddock tries not to let poverty get to him. His love for Mae and his kids anchor him, and we see him trying to stitch together a life for his wife and children: working injured on the docks, standing in line for government benefits, and trying to scrape his way back as a boxer. Through every challenge Crowe embodies Braddock with the anguished quietude of an obstinately noble man, complete with a pitch-perfect Jersey accent.<br /><br />Suddenly Jake shows up with an opportunity that Braddock can't refuse, an offer for a one-time bout. Finally, he starts to win match after match until he's pitted against the current World Heavyweight Champion, the vicious, brutal, and cocky Max Baer (Craig Bierko). The film's final act is dedicated to this ferocious fight, which galvanized the country, and represented the ultimate triumph of the underdog.<br /><br />Clocking in at over two hours, Cinderella Man rockets along with a wild veracity, engaging and winning at every turn, and never dull. The nimbly staged fight scenes are skillfully filmed, violent but also suspenseful, sharply edited with a raw energy that pulls the viewer in. The whole film is shot beautifully with a darkened monochromatic look, a kind of washed out colour that is appropriate for the depression era story it dramatizes.<br /><br />Without resorting to melodramatic meandering, Howard weaves a tight, taught script that never falters into overt sentimentality but solidly conveys the severity of the desperation of the times. Howard has crafted an intimate, human-interest story, which also manages to encompass the emotional weight of the Great Depression.<br /><br />Braddock is a role that Russell Crowe was born to play. He instills the hero with just the right amount of tenacity and integrity and he will absolutely break your heart, from a shocking scene where it seems his heart has been torn out of his chest when he learns his children are gone; to the fighting sequences that are raw but full of humanity. Russell makes us care for this guy.<br /><br />Zellweger is also terrific as the simple yet stoic Mae, and we really feel for her dilemma when she learns that her husband will be fighting against the monstrous Baer, who has already killed two men. Paul Giamatti is another Oscar contender as Braddock's manager, crackling his lines, always concerned about Braddock, but also self-seeking and somewhat manipulative.<br /><br />There's an uncluttered clarity to these characters that befits the simplicity and courage of the man in the ring and the tough, hard-hitting times that formed him. Cinderella Man is an unflinchingly rough film, but it is also remarkably positive and life affirming, it's an astounding portrait of a man who courageously and intrepidly had the guts, bravery, and moral fiber to eventually fight back. An authentic masterpiece. Mike Leonard June 05.</p></body></html>

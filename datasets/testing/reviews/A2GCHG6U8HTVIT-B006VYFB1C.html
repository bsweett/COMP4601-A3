Moneyball is a movie that deconstructs the myths of America's home-style game and shows how it becomes an exemplar of big business. By the time Moneyball is over, baseball's traditions are as quaint as long underwear, the players have become work units, and computer analysis is still unknown by the fans as they munch their expensive hot dogs, slosh beer on their neighbors and scream joyously for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />This might seem harsh, but the first third of Moneyball, as Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, tears down traditions, rips the barnacles off the tradition-bound scouts and coaches, makes decisions that either are misunderstood or threaten the traditionalists, and gets rid of the players who don't produce just as heartlessly as a surgeon lopping off a useless finger or two, is great fun and great movie construction. The pairing of Brad Pitt (looking his nearly 50 years) as Billy Beane and Jonah Hill, as the young, round Peter Brand who doesn't know much about baseball but does know logic and analysis, is inspired. The two characters make a rich combination. The two actors make a faultless team. As Peter Brand tries to explain to Billy Beane his concept of building a winning team, we begin to understand the movie and Beane.<br /><br />Says Brand, "There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what is really happening. And this leads people who run Major League Baseball teams to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams. People who run ball clubs, they think in terms of buying players. Your goal shouldn't be to buy players, your goal should be to buy wins. And in order to buy wins, you need to buy runs. ...The Boston Red Sox see Johnny Damon and they see a star who's worth seven and half million dollars a year. When I see Johnny Damon, what I see is... is... an imperfect understanding of where runs come from. The guy's got a great glove. He's a decent leadoff hitter. He can steal bases. But is he worth the seven and half million dollars a year that the Boston Red Sox are paying him? No. No. Baseball thinking is medieval. They are asking all the wrong questions."<br /><br />Then there's the middle. We learn about Billy's sadness...his ex-wife, who seems a nice lady; his young daughter, who plays a guitar and sings awful songs of her own, I assume, composing. The brightest spot here is a brief scene with his former wife's new husband, played by Spike Jonz.  All of this is irrelevant, both to the story and to maintaining our interest.<br /><br />Then there's the last third: Final validation. An offer hard to refuse. A grand gesture. The loneliness of Billy Beane. A lot of driving around. Its all piece parts that writer Aaron Sorkin most probably couldn't bear to cut or eliminate.<br /><br />We start out with a superbly constructed and acted feel-good movie. The slow letdown into Hollywood predictability, earnestness and personal angst is disappointing. The movie runs 2 hours and 13 minutes. Slogging through the last half makes it seem longer.<br /><br />Phillip Seymore Hoffman is unnecessarily cast as the Athletics' head coach, an experienced baseball traditionalist who disagrees with Billy Beane. Any competent character actor could have effectively played the role. Casting Hoffman was indulgence on someone's part, I assume, so that Pitt and Hoffman could have a couple of "acting" moments.<br /><br />The first third of Moneyball was so good I wished the rest of the movie had kept up.</p></body></html>

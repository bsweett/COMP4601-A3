<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1"></head><body><p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is the first of two parts of the last two films. The special effects are impressive and the acting is right on the mark. Especially well-played is the part played by Helena Bonham Carter as she plays the demented and crazy wizard Bellatrix Lestrange. As a fantasy movie it is splendid; as an adaptation of the book it is quite good. Clocking in at 140 minutes it feels a bit short and I wish they could release an extended version of the film. Still and all a quite good film that I can gladly recommend. 4/5.</p></body></html>

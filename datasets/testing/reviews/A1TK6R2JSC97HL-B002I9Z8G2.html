<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good "Next Generation" Movie"></head><body><p>I'm not sure of the "even sequel" rule (which stresses even-numbered episodes of Trek films as superior to the odd-numbered), but this flick was more entertaining than I would have expected from a "Next Generation" movie (and that's not even counting the horrible "Star Trek: Generations").  <p>In this episode (I meant movie!! I mean it!!!), the Enterprise again confronts the Borg - the implacable alien race of cyborgs committed to "assimilating" every intelligent race it meets (unlucky races find that their members are turned into drones under the command of a "collective conscience" while their technology and everything else about them is appropriated by the Borg). Despite destroying the Borg's ship, Captain Picard quickly realizes that even victory was futile: a Borg shuttle escapes the carnage and journeys back to Earth's pre-Federation past.  Halfway through the time-slipstream, the crew of the Enterprise catches a glimpse of their Earth having already been assimilated.  Realizing that the Borg have somehow changed history, Captain Picard leads the Enterprise through the rift and discovers that the Borg have journeyed to the moment where mankind achieved "first contact" with intelligent extra-terrestrial life.  Historically, the moment came when inventor Zephram Cochrane (James  Cromwell) first tested his revolutionary spaceship, one powered by the then unknown warp-drive, and attracted the attention of a passing Vulcan survey vessel.  The Enterprise destroys the Borg ship - but the Borg survive somehow manage to invade the ship and begin assimilating it.  With his crew reduced and his ship barely under his control in Earth's orbit, Picard leads the remnants of his crew against the Borg infestation.  On the ground, an away team meets with Cochrane himself and help him repair his experimental ship - damaged earlier by a Borg attack.  <p>I'm no fan of the "Next Generation" but this sequel was a surprise.  Jonathan Frakes's direction is tense and captures the fear the Borg inspire and the claustrophobia of the new Enterprise (this was the debut of Enterprise-E).  On the downside - the film never becomes more than an exceptional episode of a TV show, as opposed to the more cinematic films of "classic" trek.  The crew is inexplicably forthcoming with Dr. Cochrane and other denizens of the "past" - Kirk and company were a lot funnier trying to hide that they were from the future.  Also, Dr. Cochrane's mountain base is so remote, he might as well be set in the future himself - there's no frame of reference linking him to Trek's past aside from what the script just tells us.  The script also makes a critical mistake with the Borg by giving them a queen.  Though Alice Krige vamps sexily as the queen, it undermines the Borg as being a force of nature blind to the destruction they cause - now they're just a bunch of aliens having a technology that can't be stopped, and led by an evil ruler.  Also, the basic plot left me scratching my head, if the Borg had achieved time travel, would they really need to conquer Earth?  And as logical machines, how would they get past paradoxes of time travel?  All in all, still a superior "Next Generation" Effort.</p></body></html>

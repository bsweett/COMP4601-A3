Therefore I will unnecessarily write yet another review that will simply repeat everything that's already been said.<br /><br />Yes, what a slog.  Though a fan of Jack Black, I was both shocked and saddened to see him in this tedious tripe.<br /><br />I suppose the script's premise must have seemed a lot more hilarious on paper than it turned out to be once they hitched Black up in those turquoise tights.<br /><br />There are very few laughs.  I think in large part this is because Black is harnessed:  forced to deliver all his lines through his clenched and rigid Mexican accent.<br /><br />But whatever your theory is, you gotta agree:  there are very few laughs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The New Age of Artless Slasher Films"></head><body><p>Hostel is about three young men; Americans Paxton and Josh and their Icelandic friend Oli, who travel to Amsterdam in search of drugs and hookers.  In the long run they take their party to a quasi-Slovakia.  Oli goes missing and so does some Japanese girl.  No big deal right? So Paxton and Josh decide to party with some Russian girls and get a little bit too hammered.  So much so that Paxton ends up passing out in a storage room.  Josh wakes up in a dungeon and some Dutch guy starts to torture him, using a power drill and cutting his Achilles tendons.  By the time Paxton gets back to the hostel, everyone is missing, well almost everyone.  Josh finds those Russian girls again and starts pressing them for answers.  He ends up finding an abandoned warehouse where people pay to torture prisoners and he gets snatched up and tortured himself.  I'll stop there as things unfold in a fairly fun, albeit predictable manner.<br /><br />If that kind of story interests you and you're the kind of person that likes to watch excruciating torture scenes, then Hostel is the film for you.  But don't worry, it doesn't desensitize because Hostel's director is so amateur in handling his actors you will not see Josh, Paxton, Oli and their international congregation of half-nude nymphs as real people.  They are like dolls and the fake setting is their dollhouse.  You see, the Slovakia we see in Hostel is not real.  That's right Eli Roth has said "Americans do not even know that this country exists. My film is not a geographical work but aims to show Americans' ignorance of the world around them."  You've got to be kidding me?  Isn't he just as ignorant as his audience?  And why isn't his audience offended by these comments anyway?  With comments like that it makes me wonder, is Hostel not supposed to be convincing?  I'm not supposed to take this movie seriously?  What is the point then?  Anyway, Roth has yet to show that he can make a movie with real acting and a convincing screenplay.  So far, that places Hostel squarely in the great tradition of crappy slasher movies.  Roth is not John Carpenter.  He is not even Steve Miner.  He is simply a guy who capitalizes on a young blood thirsty audience that wants to test itself.<br /><br />I feel like I really just ripped into Hostel.  Something about it bothered me deeply.  On the other hand, something about it also impressed me.  I was provoked in two different directions.  The accuracy and compelling elements that I all too often take for granted in films I think are quality, were absent in Hostel, but that doesn't mean that Hostel isn't a unique and terrifying experience.  I cringed more here than in many films.  I thought Takashi Miike's Audition (Miike makes a brief cameo here, kudos to Roth for respecting his influence) was a classic in the horror genre and had Hostel been any bit as compelling as Audition was, it would've gained great praise from this viewer.<br /><br />There is something hopeless about Roth's films.  Like many good horror filmmakers, Roth will not turn away and will dispatch of a traditional hero-type in a gruesome way without even thinking twice.  No one is safe in a Roth film and his unflinching murders scenes are as intense as any, and they work.  Some people critically call his films "torture porn" and I'm not so sure I disagree with that label.  Then again as a deterrent, I'm not so sure that is such disparaging classification in terms of horror films either.  Hostel and Hostel II made $105 million worldwide combined, and together they cost about one tenth that amount. "Torture porn" sounds like a market brand more than a criticism.  But that does not make Hostel a great movie.</p></body></html>

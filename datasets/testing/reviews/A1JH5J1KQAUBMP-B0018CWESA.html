The Rock showed that he had the presence to carry a film, but the story is ridden with cliches and the narrative is strewn with coincidence.  There is always a handy escape route when the Rock needs it, and he always encounters unexpected comrades when they are required.  Brand is miscast as the warlord; he is not physically imposing and never quite seems like a match for Johnson.  The only things that raise this film (barely) to the 3-star level are the Rock's charisma and some decent action scenes.</p></body></html>

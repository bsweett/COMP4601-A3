Wanting to see this because I thought Hostel really touched on some ideas which had rich subplots to them, which could be carried on into other films of this genre perhaps, or wondering if Eli Roth, as self centered and ego driven as he is, was hoping that perhaps he would find a bit of charisma, chemistry, cohesion, character or hmmm, I don't know, perhaps something tangible in all of this, and we are left with nothing but a purposeless redundant look at a really horrific script with dry humor that bordered on revolting and cliched nuances that deeply moved me to actually think about turning it off, which I have never done since walking out of Spaced Invaders. I didn't care one iota about the girls in the movie, in fact I was hoping they would be killed.<br /><br />Eli Roth said this in an interview: "Yeah man, I'm f***ing psyched. I honestly think that no matter what other movie comes out this summer -- no matter what their budget is -- nothing will even come close to the kind of ending we have in Hostel 2. I think it's one of the most shocking endings people have ever seen in a mainstream horror film. I think this is the movie where people are going to come out of it going, 'I can't even believe someone just did that."<br /><br />I can't believe it was so bad. The ending was juvenile, pompous and actually funny. If you are into gore, lots of it, (well at least in one scene which personally I turned from the screen which was a first in my movie loving life), and like movies with no depth and equally no brain, then I can see why this would be right up your alley. Eli has talent and this was no shining example of what his potential is.</p></body></html>

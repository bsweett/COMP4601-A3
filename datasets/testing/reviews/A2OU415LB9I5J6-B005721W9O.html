<meta name="summary" content="Galaxy Quest"></head><body><p>A little disclaimer: I held a little prejudice going into this movie; I do not like Tim Allen as a general rule. When this movie came out, I have to say that I wasn't interested at all. I wasn't into Star Trek, which this movie largely riffs on, and the movie looked cheesy from the initial trailers I saw. Add to that the fact that Tim Allen received top billing, and you might as well count the movie down for the count with me. But after hearing great word of mouth and seeing great reviews, I decided to put aside my prejudices when the blu-ray of the film was released recently.<br /><br />Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) are the crew of a now defunct 80's sci-fi television show called Galaxy Quest. Relegated to appearances at fan conferences and the like, answering inane questions about the show, and repeating lines from the show they wish people would forget ("By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons of Worvan, you shall be avenged...") everyone is dealing with the fact that they are washed up has-beens living in the past and ready to throw in the towel. Just as their life seems meaningless a race of aliens asks for their help, thinking they are a real ship's crew, and the show is their "historical documents."<br /><br /> I definitely made the right choice in finally giving the movie a try. Like recent "spoof" movies like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Galaxy Quest mixes reverance and spoof with great characterizations and an amazing plot to create a hilarious and fun riff of the sci-fi genre. Written by David Howard and directed by Dean Parisot, Galaxy Quest utilizes homages to movies and TV series from Star Trek to Star Wars to get the feeling of real sci-fi films, knowing when, and when not, to take itself seriously. Not only does this help to amp up the comedy, but it also gives us characters we can believe when they're thrown into extraordinary situations.<br /><br />The casting is phenomenal, making for a diverse, funny, and well acted movie. The true stand outs in the film are Alan Rickman as a thespian who used to actually be a respected actor, but is now stuck spewing ridiculous catch phrases for fanboys and being upstaged by the Shatneresque Jason Nesmith; and Sam Rockwell as Guy Fleegman, a throwaway former cast member who died on his only episode of the show that is consistently worried throughout the movie that he's going to die in real life because he died on the show. Naturally, though, the whole cast is stunning, as could be noted by the pedigree of acting included here.<br /><br />If I had one quibble with the movie, though, it would have to be the way the alien race is portrayed. I know they're not even humanoid creatures, but when they take the appearance of being human they could have been a little more natural, and not as stiff, or, dare I say it, annoying. They get better throughout the course of the movie, but they are still more or less caricatures throughout the movie and should have been just a little more fleshed out.<br /><br />All in all I have to say that the film was extremely enjoyable, and I highly recommend it. If you enjoy Star Trek, Star Wars, or well done comedy spoofs, you're almost guaranteed to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></body></html>

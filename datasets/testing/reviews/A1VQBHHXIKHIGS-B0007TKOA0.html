<meta name="summary" content="Who cares?"></head><body><p>Start with two two-dimensional characters, the neurotic angst-filled aspiring author and the lower-tier TV actor.<br /><br />(The latter, by the way, is played by Thomas Hayden Church, so he's certainly familiar with the territory.)<br /><br />Add a simple plot.  Tour California wine country and get laid as much as possible before the wedding.  And drunk.  Throw in cardboard cutout womens and wonder why nobody laughs at the "humor."<br /><br />(I misspelled "womens" because they're that irrelevant here.)<br /><br />The one-liners didn't hit their target, the plot is so familiar, and I don't care at all about the characters.  I needed 45 minutes to turn it off, but that was because I'd just collapsed on a floor mat after a workout.  It really isn't worth 45 minutes of my life.<br /><br />But on the plus side, the scenery is truly gorgeous.</p></body></html>

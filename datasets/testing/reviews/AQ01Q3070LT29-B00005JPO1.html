<meta name="summary" content="Harrison Ford still swings as Indiana Jones"></head><body><p>It all started with the first film,<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F21K66">Raiders of the Lost Ark - Full screen Version (1981)</a> (1981).<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Special Edition)</a> (1984) (actually a prequel)<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)</a> (1989)<br /><br />Followed by the tv series, Young Indiana Jones Chronicles (1992-93, 94-96)  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDDVE">The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Volume One - The Early Years</a> (1992-93).<br />  Harrison Ford returned as "Indiana Jones" (at age 50) in the episode, "Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues" (1993-tv).<br /><br />  It has been 19 years since the Last Crusade and finally a new "Indiana Jones" Adventure is made, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008).<br />  Harrison Ford is in great physical form as "Indiana Jones" and the action and adventure is all here.<br />  Karen Allen returns as "Marion Ravenwood" from her role in the first film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F21K66">Raiders of the Lost Ark - Fullscreen Version (1981)</a> (1981).<br />  There are no appearances of anyone else in previous films, except for a photograph.<br />  The Cemetery Warriors are played by Nito Larioza and Ernie Reyes Jr. You may remember Ernie Reyes Jr. from his brief tv series, Sidekicks (1986-87).<br />  Ke Huy Quan (now Jonathan Ke Quan), "Short Round", is now a martial artist--stunt coordinator, but not in this film.<br />  Originally it was planned for him, Kate Capshaw and John Rhys-Davies to make an appearanc at the wedding, but I guess it didn't happen.<br />  Sean Connery turned down his chance to do a couple scenes in the film favoring retirement instead. They then added two actors, John Hurt and Jim Broadbent.<br />  I really enjoyed seeing Harrison Ford as "Indiana Jones" again. That was fun.<br />  What I did not like was the "Crystal Skull" artifact which looked like a cheap plastic thing with cellophane wrapping inside.  Steven Spielberg's obsession with aliens is prominent in this film and every other film Spielberg makes.<br />  Also in the cast: Ray Winstone, Cate Blanchett, Shia LaBeouf.<br />  The end of the trail and the final act of this film is a real disappointment to many long-time "Indiana Jones" fans.  The younger generation is probably saying, "I don't get it, Daddy-O"<br /><br />  The very last scene is kind of cute, but we are still yearning for more "Indiana Jones" adventure.<br /><br />  DVD Running Time: 2 hours, 02 mins.<br /><br />  Option of language and subtitles: English, French, Spanish.<br /><br />  Thank goodness THX changed their old intro. I absolutly hated that old one with the very annoying organ sound that kept getting louder. Gets in the ears and makes people ill. Now they have a very nice, CGI flowery THX intro. Nice and harmonious to watch.<br /><br /> Featurette: Return of a Legend (17 min).<br /><br />  Yes, I would watch "Indiana Jones 5".<br />  To: Mr. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, please don't wait too long to make "Indiana Jones 5", we are all getting older.<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RERN30">Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings</a> is now available for Playstation 2, Sony PSP, Wii, Ninetendo DS.</p></body></html>

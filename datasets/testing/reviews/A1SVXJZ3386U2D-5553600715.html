Without any fore-knowledge, I was properly surprized at how the film evolved and finished.  Along the way there were a number goosebumps as well as a bit of confusion.  The film starts out a bit too complicated and some of the complications could have been jetisonned from the script.  On the other hand, I'm assuming that a number of people will have watched it at least one more time to see how well everything fits together after they've seen it once.  Personally, once was enough but I'm glad I watched it.</p></body></html>

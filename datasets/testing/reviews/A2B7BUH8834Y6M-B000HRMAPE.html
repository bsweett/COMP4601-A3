<meta name="summary" content="Very entertaining and very impossible..."></head><body><p>If you're like me, you love to see good guys win, bad guys get what they deserve, and have lots of things blow up. This is Mission Impossible III. Lots of explosions. Lots of plot twists. A doomed romance. Friends that die, betray and are betrayed.... and lots of techno gadgets tht never fail... hence the impossible part.<br /><br />It's fun to see the comraderie of the principle characters that have absolutely no fear. They speak every language, they are fit, they have extensive knowledge of various weapons, hand-to-hand fighting techniques, and none of them fears heights, water, knives, guns, fire, poison - you name it - they are invincible.<br /><br />A highly enjoyable movie-going experience to be sure, but this is one I could live without seeing again. There are some movies that intrigue so much, you don't realize until days later the holes in the plot - but this is one of the movies where you see them as they happen. Albeit James Bond-esque, this movie hinges upon everyone fulfilling their role flawlessly and not one of their high-tech gadgets ever failing. I do believe a lot more plot and script development was present in the first two installments than in this feature.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman is (big shock) utterly flawless, and one of the best parts of the film. The whole take-over plot involving the Vatican was very enjoyable, but I believe many integral parts had to end up on the cutting room floor to make the movie an appropriate length. When I see movies like "The Bourne Identity" where they explain everything within the allotted time, it still has amazing explosions, tech and fighting, yet you get emotionally involved w/ the plot and characters and find everything fairly plausible, it's hard to excuse this film from its shortcomings with a straight face.<br /><br />There is enough good acting, gun play and stunt moves to save it from total duldrums, but this is not big on intellectualism. Sound buffs will appreciate the attention to detail regarding the sound. While the plot is questionable, I wouldn't be surprised to see this film get nominated in the Best Sound category at next year's Oscars - every helicopter blade, handcuff link and shell casing can be heard plunking away ala Doppler effect across the theater - I haven't heard Foley sounds that good in a long time.</p></body></html>

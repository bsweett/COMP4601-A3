Thankfully Pierce Brosnan does an excellent job at being the suave, debonair 007.<br />The story begins in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea with a highspeed hovercraft chase and continues via Hong Kong to Cuba and London where Bond meets up with the two women Jinx (Halle Berry) and Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) who play such important and differing roles in his quest to unmask a traitor and to prevent a war of catastrophic consequence.  Hot on the trail of the villains, Bond travels to Iceland where he experiences at first hand the power of an amazing new weapon before a dramatic confrontation with his main adversary back in Korea where it all started.  Although this was an ok Bond flick, I wouldn't rush out to buy it and add it to my collection.  No one will ever compare to Sean Connery.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tony Scott has become a predictable and increasingly manipulative filmmaker"></head><body><p>Unstoppable is indeed very stoppable, and blessedly so; hitting pause while going to get a beer has rarely felt like such a relief. The first hour is so full of modern film cliches that it was just plain annoying:<br /><br />-Shaky Hand-Cam TM that's supposed to make you feel excited but just makes you feel ill<br />-pointlessly sudden close-ups that achieve the same effect as the shaky hand-cam<br />-unbelievably manipulative music that tells you what you're supposed to feel just before you could ever actually feel it from what's on screen...and way louder than the dialogue so you have to lunge for the remote or have your eardrums assaulted<br />-brief and all-too-standard character bios that reveal the same tired character types, especially the young married couple on the rocks (gee, all they need is a good disaster to rekindle their love!)<br />-product placement galore (like we don't get enough Faux News in "reality" these days?)<br />-etc etc<br /><br />Scott and Denzel hit a home run with Man On Fire but have since tried variations on that pattern to ever-less success, and Unstoppable is so formulaic that these two seem to be on auto-pilot. Yes, it's based on a true story, but there are so many hackneyed tropes here that it might as well be entirely fake, I mean fictional.<br /><br />[Spoilers] The train literally turns the magic final curve on half its wheels?! Are you kidding? Why not have Superman come down and set it straight while you're at it? Ridiculous. Either you're going for realism, or you're not. Which is it?<br /><br />We're told the train is going 71 mph and is 10 miles from the next Big Event...and then it takes 20 minutes to get there, with no apparent back-time shots, etc. What, we can't do math?<br /><br />The tv helicopter hovers over the entire ride and almost hits the rescue chopper...and not one person ever mentions the danger or stupidity of that? Come on.<br /><br />Denzel is just getting lazy, or maybe he has no acting chops any more, or something, because every role he takes seems to require less and less thought and feeling, with the script supplying all the dramatic movement while DW just grimaces and looks fully committed to whatever crazy stunt he's about to let his stunt double do. Speaking of which, the hopping across trains at 75 mph at 60 years old with nary a hitch? Pull the other one.<br /><br />Pine is fine but feels like Paul Walker or any other of the new blond pretty boys who think scowling equals acting. Ditto most of the other actors here: bland. It just never felt right or real, but instead like a movie hyping itself at every turn.<br /><br />The final 20 minutes are better than the rest, but not by much. The final screen shot showing that Denzel's character got his full pension back is so funny it's a joke. The guy saves the entire company and gets a pat on the back? Believable, but for the movie to show it as some sort of justice is, like so much of this predictable Hollywood tripe, self-defeating.<br /><br />I love popcorn movies, and this is surely one, but both the director and star can do SO much better. Too bad they're just going for the easy money now.<br /><br />Speaking of which, this blu-ray package is a rip-off at 39, or even 20. Who needs a BD hi-def picture for a movie purposely shot extra-grainy and shaky to get that "real feel"? Nobody. This blu-ray is a waste of money, and the extras are also on the dvd, so get that if you must, but better yet just rent this, or best yet, watch any of a thousand better popcorn action thrillers before you pop this one in the player. It's only Unstoppable if you let it get started...and even then that beer break will be such a relief. You might just want to stay in the kitchen and turn on the radio.</p></body></html>

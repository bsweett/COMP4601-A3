<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Action Movie..."></head><body><p>This is The Rock's real first breakthrough action picture.  There is a great moment early on when the torch is symbolically passed on from a different action hero.  What is astonishing about The Rundown is how visually interesting it is.  This is surprising because it is directed by the actor Peter Berg, who was the male lead in The Last Seduction.  He comes up with a lot of interesting techniques and special effects, which is important in the action genre because we've seen it all before.<p>As an actor, Berg seems to have an intuitive sense of how to get good performances out of people - in this case, The Rock.  He comes off sufficiently charming and heroic in this movie, if somewhat rough around the edges.  He is also allowed to play some of the gags for laughs.  Christopher Walken turns what could be a forgettable villain into an interesting part.  Sean William Scott is as good as always - he is well on his way to becoming a great romantic/comedic leading man.<p>The Rundown may not win any Oscars, but it certainly makes for a fun rental.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Quirky 'Blood Simple-'Type Coen Brothers Crime Show"></head><body><p>This movie reminded me of the Coen Brothers' first film, "Blood Simple" (1984). with its understated but quirky and violent characters, odd dialog and sudden brutality. It's an odd crime film, but that what's the Coen Brothers usually deliver us: odd and entertaining movies. Whether it's the "Best Picture Of The Year," I question, but I did find it fascinating. I liked it even more the second time.<br /><br />Many times the villain is the most interesting character in a movie, and I'd have to say that's the case here, too. Javier Bardem, a Spanish actor, plays "Anton Chigurh" and this guy is one strange dude, with an even-stranger weapon. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are almost as intriguing. Brolin is "Llewelyn Moss," a guy out hunting one day and finds dirty money at a bloody crime scene, takes it, and is on the run from the crooks who own it. Jones is the local sheriff, "Ed Tom Bell," who actually tries to help Moss by grabbing him before the killers do. Ed Tom admits times sure have changed and deranged killers like "Anton" are totally unexplainable. To me, Jones is always a great actor to watch.<br /><br />The supporting actors in here are all good, too, and also quirky....just like the Coens like them (see "Fargo" for a good example).<br /><br />Another star of this film is cinematographer Roger Deakins, one of the best - if not the best - in the business. His work here really looks spectacular when viewed on Blu-Ray. This is one of the best Blu-Ray transfer I've seen.<br /><br />To me, though, the highlight of this film was the dialog. Man, there were some strange sentences uttered in here with some odd grammar and expressions thrown in. Early on, I put on the English subtitles so I wouldn't miss any of it, or misinterpret what everyone said. In other words, this was not only a fun movie to watch, but to hear. It was very suspenseful most of the way as this turns out to be a long cat-and-mouse chase story. That's usually entertaining to watch, and this is no exception.<br /><br />Are there flaws in here? Sure, a couple beauties, too.....but I've rambled on enough.</p></body></html>

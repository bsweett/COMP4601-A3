In the 1940s, headstrong Steve Rogers (Evans) volunteers for a top secret government experiment that transforms him from a scrawny weakling into the Super Soldier known as Captain America. Captain America leads the fight for freedom against the evil HYDRA organization and their leader Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who has discovered an otherworldly power that will ensure him world domination. Captain America: The First Avenger is the latest comic book adaptation to hit the big screen, and is certainly a playful action-packed romp. Though not a comic book masterpiece, it does succeed in capturing the spirit of what a comic book movie should be. Director Joe Johnston has created a stylish old-fashioned adventure picture with some solid elements of drama, humor and action. The cast also includes Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci.<br /><br />If you're a fan of comic book heroes or good old-fashioned adventure, then Captain America: The First Avenger is a highly recommended addition to your Blu-Ray collection. The comic book blockbuster is presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen format. Though not the sharpest transfer of any Paramount releases, the movie still looks fantastic with fine detail and vivid colors. The 7.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack delivers fine clarity, well balanced surround effects and good bass. The Blu-Ray features a nice variety of extras: audio commentary track with director Joe Johnston and production crew, five minutes of deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, the short film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, and six behind-the-scenes and in-depth comic book featurettes. Overall, Captain America: The First Avenger scores a "B+".</p></body></html>

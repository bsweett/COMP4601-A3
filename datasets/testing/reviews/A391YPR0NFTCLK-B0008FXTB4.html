I loved GET SHORTY and I really wanted to see BE COOL but the bad reviews kept me away at first. But it was a boring saturday afternoon and we decided to hit the movies and this is what we picked. I found BE COOL charming and funny. Is not laugh out loud funny but witty and lightweight. This is a great film to watch just to pass the time. Overall BE COOL is relaxing entertainment and if I may... cool.<br /><br />Plus Uma and John are wonderful in a lovely reunion to PULP FICTION.</p></body></html>

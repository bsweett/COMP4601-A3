Not one that anyone should bother with thinking about too deeply.  It is the cinematic equivalent of going on a ride at a carnival.  Lots of show,  but not too much else.  That being said, what is interesting is how many  people have had such strong differing responses to this movie.  I've read  several reviews condemning the film for Racial stereotypes, particularly  Will Smith &amp; Judd Hirsch.  And yet in Israel the movie was praised for  these exact same portrayals -- &quot;Here we have a movie in which a Black  man and a Jewish man save the world.&quot;  In other nations of the  Mid-East the film was condemned for that very same reason -- &quot;Only in  America would they dare to make a movie where a Black man and a Jewish man  save the world.&quot;  Several of those countries cut out as much of the  Judaism elements as possible. Another bit of irony is the pro-smoking  message in the movie.  Cigars are regarded as a &quot;victory dance.&quot;  This is ironic because in Dean Devlin &amp; Roland Emmerich's previous  feature, &quot;Stargate,&quot; cigarettes are equated with death. Other  bits of criticism seem unfair.  In one of the reviews above, for example,  the critic mentions how Will Smith just happened upon his girlfriend in the  ruins of L.A.  He missed the part where Smith told her he would meet her at  the Air Force Base.  The film shows her and a few other survivor going to  the base, which was also destroyed.  But Smith did know to go there &amp;  look. I still would like to know how Hirsch &amp; Jeff Goldblum managed to  drive from New York to D.C. in 5 hours, however. One great extra on the DVD  is the alternate ending footage where Randy Quaid flies his Bi-Plane into  battle against the Alien ship.  The directors cut it because, among other  reasons, they felt the sight of an old, outmoded plane flying among  sophisticated F-18s &amp; the alien fighters would be just too silly.  An  odd thought considering the rest of the film.  I did, however, agree with  the other reasons for changing it.  I just wish they could have come to a  decent compromise to keep that bi-plane in. I would also like to add, as  much as I enjoyed this movie on DVD, the one I am really looking forward to  is JAWS!  Now there is a great Popcorn movie!</p></body></html>

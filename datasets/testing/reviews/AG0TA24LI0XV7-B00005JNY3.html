<meta name="summary" content="A Creepy, Supernatural Treat"></head><body><p>"The Skeleton Key" is one of those pleasant surprises in a movie, where everything works very well and the end result is a pleasure. I will not go into a boring synopsis of the main story as other reviewers always do (after all, these are reviews, not plot outlines).  And I will not spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet. I saw this movie expecting the typical ninety minutes of cheap thrills, and I was very wrong. When it was over I was dying to watch it again. The writing, atmosphere, and acting were dead on. I wish they made more creepy movies like this one. Good, spooky fun.</p></body></html>

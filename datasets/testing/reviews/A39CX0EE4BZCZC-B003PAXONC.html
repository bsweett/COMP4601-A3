<meta name="summary" content="Definitely Entertaining, But Fair Overall"></head><body><p>Well, this certainly was entertaining. It's no award winner, but it's involving. The hour-and-a-half goes by pretty fast, and gets you into the plight of the main character, so I give it four stars for that.<br /><br />I can't say the story is anything special, or particularly intelligent. The theme of few people left on the planet, a kind of "Planet Of The Ape" type tale, is nothing new. This one just has a few different twists to it and, film-wise, is different in that it features computerized special-effects. As one who normally enjoys those visual treats, I would rate this aspect "fair," too, like the story.<br /><br />Early on, the animals racing down New York City streets looked very fake. Later, the effects were a little better with the zombies, but nothing that would make you drop your jaw in amazement.<br /><br />Like the story and FX, Will Smith as the lead character was okay: good, but not Oscar material. Actually, I thought the German Shepherd did the best job of acting in the film!<br /><br />Having said all that, I still enjoyed the film and recommend it iff you are looking for suspense, some scary scenes and a good diversion in your life for 91 minutes.  Just know what you're getting: this is very horror-like in many spots. It's a tense story.</p></body></html>

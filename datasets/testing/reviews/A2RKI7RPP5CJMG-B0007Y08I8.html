It's not quite as funny as Matt Stone and Trey Parker's "South Park," but it definitely takes some wonderful shots at worldwide politics, the French, and the countless, mindless idiots from Hollywood who think that everyone should think their way.<br /><br />The premise is simple, Team America travels the world stopping evil, whether it be Bin Laden or, as in this flick, Kim Jong Il.  They do so by literally blowing up everything in their path.  As the story unfolds, the team is duped by Kim Jong Il into seeking out multiple terrorist threats while he convinces the Film Actors Guild(F.A.G.) that he is actually seeking out world peace.  The F.A.G., headed up by blithering idiot Alec Baldwin, easily fall into his trap, not to mention the bulk of the world's leaders.  Meanwhile, at the Team America Headquarters inside Mount Rushmore, Michael Moore attempts to shut down their operations.<br /><br />As all of this is going on, we are given countless humorous and smart shots at Hollywood and politics.  The comedy is both bitter and cutting.  Also, as with the "South Park" movie, we are given a few nice songs, most notably Kim Jong Il's "Ronery" song and the hilarious Team America theme.<br /><br />Tolerance is always being screeched about by the schmucks in Hollywood, yet when they become the focus of smart humor, they get angry.  Perhaps they are the ones who need to learn a little about tolerance.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of "South Park" and to those who actually get the humor portrayed by this flick.</p></body></html>

But what they didn't know is that the monsters are as scared of us as we are of them! By watching Monsters, Inc. you get the whole story and a new light what goes on behind those closed doors. Monsters, Inc. is a superb movie, filled with all the great characters, comedy, and CGA that the movie-going audience has come to expect from the greatest duo to produce computerized movies, Walt Disney Productions and PIXAR. It gives the audience a lot to enjoy, with very little in the way of detractors.<br /><br />The movie centers around two monsters, James P. Sullivan, AKA, "Sully," and his best friend, roommate, and Scare Assistant, Mike Wazowski and their adventures with a genuine child, who has been set loose in Monstropolis and Monsters, Inc. Together, they protect the child and bring her back home safely, all the time having great adventures and misadventures. Wonderful movie for the kids as well as the adults. My kids warned this DVD out since its first release. For those techno junkies out there, the animation is one of the BEST I've ever seen. The story is very well developed and imaginative; the technical aspects of this movie are superb. You can actually see the fur moving on the monsters and the air move around them especially the fur on Sully. Again, very funny and not to scary for the little ones. Highly recommend.</p></body></html>

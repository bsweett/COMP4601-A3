<meta name="summary" content="A fun romantic comedy that stops short of being a chick flick"></head><body><p>"Hitch" is a romantic comedy that has many enjoyable moments, some good laughs, and stops just short of being a chick flick.  Will Smith has a wonderful screen presence as Hitch (Alex Hitchens) who has a private consulting practice of helping feckless men pull things together enough to get a shot at the woman of their dreams.  Not in a predatory way, but because they are men who like women and have what passes today for honorable intentions.  However, because his practice is so confidential there are certain rumors that surface that ascribe all kinds of malevolent power to the "date doctor".<br /><br />Kevin James is terrific as Albert, one of Hitch's biggest challenges.  Albert is in love with a celebrity far out of his league, Allegra Cole (named after an allergy medicine?) played with humanity and worldly knowing by Amber Valleta.  After Hitch assesses the situation he realizes what a great guy Albert is and decides that getting Allegra to notice Albert would be his Sistine Chapel.<br /><br />Sara, played with energy and charm by Eva Mendes, who is a gossip columnist after stories about Allegra Cole.  She notices this ordinary guy with Allegra and wonders what is up.  Along the way she meets Hitch and they develop half a thing.<br /><br />I will let you discover for yourself the rest of the hijinks that ensue.<br /><br />The ending is weaker than the middle acts, but this is a romantic comedy so who really cares.  Just enjoy the show with someone you care about.</p></body></html>

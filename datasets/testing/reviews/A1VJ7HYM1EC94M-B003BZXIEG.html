<meta name="summary" content="X-Men - The Disappointment of III"></head><body><p>Never before have I waited with so much breathless anticipation for a film to be so utterly disappointed.  The premise of "X-3" held so much promise and yet failed to deliver anything of substance beyond some impressive looking, yet still somehow bland, battle sequences.  Without giving away details, the death of certain important characters pass by producing a lack of emotional response from an audience that should more properly be devastated, not merely thinking "Gee . . . what a bummer."<br /><br />The manner in which the Dark Phoenix was presented was mind numbingly bad.  Astonishingly bad.  Bad, bad, bad.  (Did I mention it was bad?)  Instead of the soul tortured Jean returning and unleashing her demonic powers, we have Famke Jannsen with contact lensed googly eyes while it looks like she's being poked from behind with a cattle prod.  Yeah, there's some intense drama for you.<br /><br />The only real "fun" in the movie (if it can be called that) is watching the increasingly insane behavior of Magneto.  Ian McKellen almost realizes there's no way to play this but waaaaay over the top . . . and thank God, for him.<br /><br />As Beast, Kelsey Grammer makes a brilliant debut to the X-series, however not even he can charm his way through some of the most inane dialogue written - even for a comic book movie.  Still, Grammer's Beast is wicked cool!<br /><br />The dialogue throughout seems to have been written by high school fans and shows remarkably little respect for the intelligence of either the films characters, or the audience cajoled into watching this mess.  One perfect example of this occurs when, as preparing to battle Magneto and his enormous forces, Iceman tells Wolverine something like "But there's only a handful of us against all of them" to which Wolverine responds "I'm not going to lie to you. We are outnumbered."  Oh, really?<br /><br />Jackman is always fun and his Wolverine remains probably the coolest character to make the transition from comic book to screen, but he figures too prominently here - and even he can't save this mess.<br /><br />Its runtime of just over 90 minutes doesn't help either - everything blurs together too quickly with little time for development, which means little empathy from the audience.  See it if you have to, but be forewarned, X-III falls flat like a badly, took-quick cooked souffl&eacute;.</p></body></html>

And I bought this 2-disc special edition at the mall recently, simply because of its reputation. After all, Entertainment Weekly rated this film #18 out of the top 25 scariest movies of all time, and said it had "the most vicious murder scene ever filmed." But just like a lot of the other so called horror "classics", I feel that this film is a bit overrated. Not to say that this is actual "bad" film, but what exactly separates this film from all the others? Its certainly don't think its the story. Though the main plot isn't bad, there's nothing real special about it. The story is about an American dancer who arrives at an European dance school and has odd occurrences begin to happen to her, including disappearances/murders of fellow students. Later she finds out that the school is simply a front for a coven of witches who practice a diabolical black magic. Again, not bad for a story, but nothing amazing about it either. The acting is not terrible; Jessica Parker does a decent job with the lead role as the American dancer, but there are really no stellar performances here. Now, as far as the "most vicious murder scene ever filmed" that happens just minutes into the film, I gotta say I was somewhat disappointed in it. It wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected, and the blood look a bit fake (it was too bright). Nevertheless, the scene was done pretty well, with some good suspense. With this opening scene, the film did fool me a bit. I thought it was going to be more of a slasher film than anything, but turns out, its not. The special effects weren't nothing great, again, my biggest complaint was the blood being way too bright in color. As well as the body count being fairly low, which I suppose really has nothing to do with this type of film since it isn't a slasher film or anything, but thats something that I do look at when rating horror/thriller films. Now as far as the strong point in the film, its got to be the atmosphere, lighting, and overall mood of the movie. This is something that Argento did exceptionally well. The soundtrack to the film is creepy and dark, the unconventional lighting, mostly bright red and blue, are really good as well as some great camera angles. But I feel that in some parts of the film where the story bogs down a bit, the mood and atmosphere try to carry the movie by itself, which really doesn't work. Yes, I think the overall feel of a movie is very important, but there has to be some substance to it as well. And I just feel that the overall story doesn't match intensity with the mood at most times. Again, like I said before, I'm not saying this is a bad movie, believe me. But I'm not sure why this film is so highly praised by some people. Perhaps after a couple of more viewings, I'll see what some of you are talking about. Meanwhile, I do recommend watching this movie to any horror fanatic, however, I would suggest to watch it before you buy, unless you find it fairly cheap to purchase.</p></body></html>

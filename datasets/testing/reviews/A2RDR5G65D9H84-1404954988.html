A lot of people when faced with this question when applying for a college make similar choices, but for Cristina the winning candidate is crystal clear: her mother. Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) was abandoned by her husband and decided to leave Mexico and go to Los Angeles with her little girl to start a new life. At first she stayed within the Mexican community, working two jobs and barely making ends meet. But when her growing daughter required more of her attention and supervision she had to jump into the Anglo world, where she could earn more than double in only one job.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of the movie is the clash of cultures we witness when Flor starts interacting with the Clasky family as their hired help, and with the lady of the house in particular. Deborah (Tea Leoni) is an extroverted and overachieving woman that pushes everyone else in her family to her limits. Her husband John (Adam Sandler) is the complete opposite; he is calm and collected, loves his kids and accepts them the way they are, and even though he is an excellent chef, he is not looking for great success. His goal is "three and a quarter stars".<br /><br />John quickly starts to see that the things that are important for Flor are similar to what he considers relevant in life and that this does not happens when he compare his goals with his wife's. And this is the other attractive aspect of the movie, John's realization of other alternatives and how he navigates through them. Especially after things start to get mixed up when Flor does not want to be just an observer in the life of the Clasky's, but decides to get involved too.<br /><br />Besides the great script, this film has a memorable cast that fit their roles amazingly well. Leoni is so successful in playing the stereotypical striving type A woman that she gets on the viewer's nerves at times (at least she did in mine). Sandler has evolved as an actor, from someone that could make us laugh, to a more complete actor who can arise other emotions from us as well. Sarah Steele is adorable in the role of Bernice, the Clasky's daughter, a girl who is as lovely as one can be, but is continually chastised by her mother because she is overweight. Then we get to Paz Vega, a new face that does not disappoint; probably some people will compare her to Penelope Cruz, and they may be right. In my particular case, I liked her freshness and irreverence even more.<br /><br />Do not be misguided, this is not your typical romantic comedy, with a thought provoking plot and a well-chosen cast, this is a very good movie that shines when compare to any other genre. I recommend it wholeheartedly.</p></body></html>

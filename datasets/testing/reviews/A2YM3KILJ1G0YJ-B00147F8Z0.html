<meta name="summary" content="Needs a Predator night-vision viewing mode"></head><body><p>When a Predator spacecraft carrying Alien prisoners and face-huggers - as well as some crossbred experiments - has an accident and crash lands on Earth, humanity has no chance for survival.  Each wandering human on camera is certainly doomed.  Humanity's only hope is a master hunter from planet Predator, a creature with unequaled hunting prowess and futuristic weapons.<br /><br />The situation in town quickly becomes chaotic, with Aliens spitting out chest-bursters left and right.  A few stereotypical, assembly line characters not worth mentioning by name band together to feebly protect themselves from a town being taken over so quickly and completely that within 12-hours there is an Alien on the city council.  Meanwhile, master Predator follows human viscera, blood spatter, and a slug trail of Alien ejaculate throughout town in his version of CSI.<br /><br />Dumb father of dumb kid: "It sure is dark here."<br />Alien: "Oh hai...I'm gonna eat youuu.  Get back in there little mouth."<br />Human kid: "Don't kill my fodder!"<br />Predator: (Infrared mode) sees face-hugger carcass, follows bread-crumb trail of slime<br /><br />That's pretty much the movie.  There's a cool new Alien method of shoving eggs into pregnant women, and someone repeats the classic, "Get to the choppah" line from Predator, but otherwise it's a forgettable.  And the main reason it's forgettable?  The lighting is atrocious.<br /><br />Half the time you don't even know what's going on.  It is without a doubt, the worst lit movie I have ever seen.  Open, window-filled rooms are dungeons.  Sewers are absolute black holes.  There were several scenes I wish I had seen - and my eyes were open - but there was no way to ascertain what was happening.  None of the actors really stand out - a result of mediocre acting, a bad script, as well as the previously mentioned viewing issues.  The contrast level of my TV could not be calibrated enough to compensate for the "filming eclipse" technique used like camouflage.  Since the DVD release doesn't have a night vision or "through the Predator's eyes" mode, it is almost pointless to watch a movie through an ink-filled lens.<br /><br />Watching this again, recommending it to others...I can't see it.</p></body></html>

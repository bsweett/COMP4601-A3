However, unlike most films that were terrible out of the gate, this movie ultimately does have at least a couple of neat ideas and some cool visuals but it's barely held together by a tiny thread, bad performances, dialogue, CG and a weak story.<br /><br />It's the future and mankind has been partially wiped out by a new virus, turning people into Hemophages. Vampire-teethed with moves out of the Matrix but with a short life-span, they've been looking for the cure for a long time. Their existence is threatened though when a new weapon is revealed and Violet, a kick-butt kind of girl with a weird need to change the color of her hair and clothes frequently, intercepts it. Turns out the weapon is actually a boy with special blood that Violet has to protect while trying to kill those who stand in their way. If it sounds cliche and cheesy to read, it's because it was cheesy and cliche to say.<br /><br />A lot of these movies are obviously geared towards the action junkie type with fast fight choreography which gets hampered by MTV-affected editing like the camera can't sit still for more than 2 seconds. It's a shame though since there's at least some cool ideas here. There's a gravity...thing that doesn't get rid of gravity so much as alter it, allowing Violet to fall through ceilings or walk along them and in one logic-stretching scene, ride a motorcycle across a building before switching gears and riding up it. It's a really cool visual idea(if a bit taken from Episode II and probably some other movie I never saw) where Violet has a sword fight in darkness with the only light coming from their swords that are on fire. Unfortunately the film is just marred by practically everything(except for William Fichtner, seen in films like Armageddon, Perfect Storm or Contact). I can't tell whether this is a double-dip film in the future or they knew the film wasn't going to be a hit so they just put minimal extras. We have a commentary by star Milla Jovovich rather than the director and we have a rather fluffy making-of you've seen everywhere.<br /><br />Should you buy this? I'm going to have to say no. I mean there's enough interesting visuals or scenes to at least warrant a watch but most of the time the movie will just sit there on the shelf and one day you'll go "oh yeah, I forgot I bought this thing...wonder if I can sell it somewhere?"</p></body></html>

This film is partly based on letters written by Japanese who perished there, but many characters and conversations are fictional. Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) determines that a conventional beach defense of Iwo Jima will quickly fail and orders the creation of an extensive tunnel system and a northern defensive line. Kuribayashi's unorthodox strategy breeds dissent among his officers, while he prepares the troops to fight a losing battle against the approaching American armada. The trials and fears of the average soldier are represented by Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a reluctant but resigned Private, who thinks of his family back home and runs afoul of his strict superiors.<br /><br />"Letters from Iwo Jima" imbues Japanese soldiers with American values in order to make them sympathetic, and it posits the two wisest officers, General Kuribayashi and Lt. Colonel Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), as more enlightened for having had contact with American culture. This might be interpreted as American ethnocentrism, but I think that the implication is simply that these men are better-equipped to understand their enemy, because they are more worldly than many of their compatriots. Japan's isolation and ignorance of other cultures led to grave miscalculations during World War II. General Kuribayashi opposed the war with the United States that he died fighting. The familiar values that the soldiers reveal through their letters and interactions seem more like a missed opportunity to present the Japanese mindset than a serious cultural blunder.<br /><br />Once I mulled over the film's obvious manipulations, however, I found that there was little else. "Letters from Iwo Jima" presents a vague, impressionistic view of the Battle of Iwo Jima. We can't make out much of the Japanese strategy, what is going on, or how long it lasts. The battle lasted nearly 40 days, whereas the film gives the impression of about a week. This film ignores the Battle's salient points in favor of sentimentality: The Japanese soldiers are honorable, loyal men who would nevertheless rather be at home with their families than burned alive in a futile attempt to defend a useless little island. I never would have guessed. This doesn't do General Kuribayashi's daring strategy justice or comment on Japan's decision to sacrifice 20,000 men, without air or sea support, in a stalling tactic. The substance and drama are in the strategic decisions, rationale, and implications, which the film relegates to background. "Letters from Iwo Jima" does everything it can to avoid pointed analysis and embrace cliches.<br /><br />The washed-out color palette struck me from the first frame of the first scene. "Letters from Iwo Jima" is in color but desaturated to the point of nearly monochrome, like a faded old photograph. Desaturating the color can be useful in films where a lot of bright red blood would distract the audience from other elements. This palette isn't unattractive, but my eyes never got used to it. My mind involuntarily kept concentrating to make out the color. This was distracting. The other visually notable feature is the scenes of American Marines invading the beaches of Iwo Jima, which are quite beautiful, but alas do not look remotely real. They are obviously CGI. The cinematographic stylization is probably too heavy-handed for its own good, which would not be a first for Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />The superficiality of "Letters from Iwo Jima" might not bother me if this material were not so rich in drama, irony, and insight: An opponent of war with America leads his troops to certain death against Americans. 20,000 men consigned to cannon fodder to buy a little time. Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi did not get along, which is more interesting than the trite friendship in the movie. A smart commander hampered by foolish underlings. A heroic defense of a hopeless cause. A completely different world view. Some Japanese soldiers lived in the tunnels for years afterward, because they didn't dare surrender. That would have made a nice epilogue if anyone really wanted to make a film about the Japanese perspective. And Iwo Jima was of no value to either Japan or the US. What could be better material for a thoughtful war movie? I was entertained by "Letters from Iwo Jima", but Clint Eastwood has managed to transform an incisive, disturbing moment in human history into something vague, mawkish, and utterly without substance. In Japanese with English, French or Spanish subtitles.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A New Christmas Tradition"></head><body><p>This may be the definitive Christmas movie and may become as iconic as Radio City Music Hall's Christmas show. It was filmed in a special process whereby human beings are morphed into cartoon like animatronic beings and the background is partly real, partly imaginary. All of this helps to create the magic and fantasy especially for kids.<br /> Will all children who doubt that Santa Claus exists, but who aren't certain of their certainty, please get on the Polar Express train to test their beliefs? Step aboard with Tom Hanks as the conductor and take a wild ride on Christmas Eve to Santa's hometown. Full of action, very scary sequences, comedy, musical numbers, and a large measure of Christmas sentimentality and bathos, the flick roars along at a fast pace, keeping the kids, and the adults who are still kids at heart, on the edges of their seats. By virtue of computer graphics we see hoards of caribou and countless elves.<br /> The movie is full of magical effects. The train runs off its tracks and goes skidding across a frozen lake with the ice cracking and chasing it. Up in Santa land on the sound track some of the Christmas standbys are sung by the old timers which make it a nostalgic treat for the oldsters watching. This movie brings back a flood of memories and regrets. If only we could go back to the time when we believed. If we could again hear those jingle bells up by the chimney (belief in Santa), how great it would be. Move over, Charles Dickens, you've got a competitor for the Christmas season.</p></body></html>

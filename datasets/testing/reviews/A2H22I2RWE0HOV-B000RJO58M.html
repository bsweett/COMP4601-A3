When you buy the DVD on a whim and check it out, knowing that it has Simon Pegg and Nick Frost from Shaun Of The Dead in it, you are pleasantly surpised that it's not all that tongue-in-cheek, as the title and the previews suggest.  In fact, Hot Fuzz is a very well done movie chockful of English humor and bits and pieces of ultra-violence.  Much like Shaun Of The Dead, minus the zombies of course.  Definitely wasn't the dumb but funny movie I was expecting, Hot Fuzz is well-plotted with intelligent humor and over-the-top situations.<br /><br />Seargeant Nicolas Angel is sent to a sleepy little country village from London because he's literally such a great cop that he's making everyone else look bad.  Trying to fit in, and finding it extremely hard to do so, Angel is face with several grisly accidents that make him suspect the sleepy little village is not all that it seems.<br /><br />Written by Edgar Wright & Simon Pegg, this movie is not quite a classic, but definitely one I would recommend and watch again. If you liked Shaun Of The Dead or are just a fan of dry English humor, this will be a treat for you.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

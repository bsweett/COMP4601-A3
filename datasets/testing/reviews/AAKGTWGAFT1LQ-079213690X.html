<meta name="summary" content="All the ingredients come together beautifully"></head><body><p>This is a film that has been done justice via the DVD format .<br />For those who like to listen to commentaries , be warned that the audio quality is not that good . It sounds as if there was a blanket over the microphone whilst it was being recorded , but Mel comes across as very human and rightly gives a lot of credit to the cinematographer .<br /><br />Many people will find the battle scenes stirring , though if you would like to get an idea of where some of the influences were from , I would refer you to the Orson Welles film called CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT . The DVD is available from Ebay sellers and it is manufactured in Spain .<br /><br />BRAVEHEART is an epic film that doesn't feel like it .<br />Great escapism and period flavour .<br />Highly recommended to lovers of films like BEN HUR .</p></body></html>

It's a movie! If I wanted a<br /><br />complete accurate story I'd read the book or something...<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is very well acted with Val Kilmer having<br /><br />his best and last good role.... But as somebody said, you<br /><br />can't forget Russell's acting in this movie. He is pretty<br /><br />good and believeable. I'm sad that they didn't get more out<br /><br />of Sam Elliot out of this one.... He is a vet of these type<br /><br />of movies... But seems to really fade into the background<br /><br />too much. One person that should have been left out is Bill<br /><br />Paxton... He is too much of a wiesel for a movie like this.</p></body></html>

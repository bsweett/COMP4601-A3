<meta name="summary" content="A really good comic book movie"></head><body><p>There hasn't been a great Superman movie made in my 22 years of living. I'm a huge fan of the man of steel though and this was one of my most antcipated movies of 06. It's Directed by Bryan Singer(X-Men, X-2} who left that franchise to come Superman. All Superman movies are graded upon the first made by Richard Donner and the numerous great tv shows based on the character. Superman Returns jumpstarts the movie franchise and gives us something Superman 3 and 4 lacked being a good movie.<br /><br />Superman(Brandon Routh) has returned to earth from his five year exodus to the planet Krypton. He found the planet in ruins and returns to earth almost in a mid-life crisis. Earth has gone on without him. Lois Lane(Bosworth) has moved on being engaged and having a five year old son. Lex Luthor(Spacey)has gotten out of jail because Superman missed his courtdate. Once again he is launching a sinister plot to make himself alot of money and kill some people in the process. Superman must rebound and stop Lex and get life back to normal.<br /><br />I liked Brandon Routh as Superman. I hate the little curl they had him wearing when he was the man of steel and not Clark Kent. He is a Christopher Reeve clone and that has to be how he got the nod over Tom Welling from Smallville. He fits the part great though. He's a physical presence on the screen and like Reeve he just embodies Superman. You look at him and say, "Yeah, this is Superman." It's a huge role for a non-known actor to take on.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is on the greatest actors of my generation and plays "The Worlds Greatest Criminal Mind" to perfection. Where Hackman was over the top Spacey is funny. He is intense at times and just a touch sarcastic. I wish he had more screen time, but oh well.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is ok as Lois. She stops the movie from being five stars. It's not that she does a bad job, it's the things she can't do. Kate is 23 years old and Lois has to be in her early 30's. She is one of the most established reporters in the world and this movie has a five year old son. She looks to fresh out of college. She has good chemistry with Routh and could have played a younger Lois fine, but just doesn't fit the movie.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic. The flying looks very real and is so smooth. It doesn't look computerized like lets say Neo in the Matrix series. He has all his abilities in the movie and uses them and they look the best they ever have.<br /><br />The specials on the two disc are alright. We have some deleted scenes and we get to hear more from Kevin Spacey. He's such good actor and gives this film some credibility.<br /><br />If you love Superman you got to pick this one up. It's a fun action movie the whole family can enjoy. Get out there and support the galaxies most powerful hero and like me just look forward to the next sequel.</p></body></html>

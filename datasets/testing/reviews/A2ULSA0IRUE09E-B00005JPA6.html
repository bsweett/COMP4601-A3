<meta name="summary" content="Reality Bites : A Young Minds' Escapist Fantasies"></head><body><p>There are 2 films within this movie :<br /><br />1. Reality through a young girls' eyes - Set in war-torn Europe, the young girl from a dysfunctional family is distracted by an alternative universe of magical beings, where she is told she is a princess of an Underworld Kingdom, and has to perform certain tasks to attain the title. These `magical tasks' (which are the centerpiece of the movie) are by far the most visually arresting I've seen in a while - it reminded me a lot of Tarsem's "The Cell" (the underrated masterpiece starring Jennifer Lopez) both visually and metaphorically.<br /><br />2. Reality as it is - The film also parallelly follows the reality of the girls' family and how the world views her - which means there is nothing magical going on, just a lot of violence and sadness, as to be expected from the dreariness of the era. Throw in an abusive father, a spineless mother, and inhospitable living conditions, and you can imagine why the girl is so desperate to block this reality out.<br /><br />The interesting thing is, the viewer is not told which reality is true. In the end, when realities converge, it is left very vague as to whose world is real. On one hand, it is suggested that the girls' elaborate fantasy (and in fact the entire film, thereby) is just an illusion. On the other hand, it is suggested that all the story was is one girls' attempt to escape the harshness of the world by creating an imaginary world that only she could see and understand. I prefer to think it's the former, but either way, this is a beautiful film that makes you think. The cinematography is brilliant, and the special effects are truly exemplary.<br /><br />However, even though I do adore this film, I can see why some people would find it pretentious and meaningless. I mean, those are cruel words for a film of this beauty, but the end of the film can leave you very cold and un-moved, even if you did enjoy everything that came before it. I saw this with someone who felt the same way but was left down by the end, which was more of an anti-climax, in the worst sort of way.<br /><br />The highlight of the film is definitely the young actress. She is not very talented as an `actress' per se, and if you know a little about film-making you can see that the performance she gave is definitely because of the efforts of her director to make her `look better' as an actress.<br /><br />That said, this is a glorious film that you should watch with someone who appreciates foreign film as much as you do. It is by no means a perfect movie, but as films of 2006 go, this was pretty much the cream of the crop.</p></body></html>

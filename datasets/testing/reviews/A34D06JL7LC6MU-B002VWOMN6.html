The movie swept the Academy Award ceremony the year of its release, winning Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, and five others and it holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List (#53). This is odd for a movie about classical music that features a lot of opera singing in it. For me, the most appealing thing about the film is the two lead performances. F. Murray Abraham (as Salieri) and Tom Hulce (as Mozart). Throughout the film, Salieri is a sympathetic character despite the fact that he's a jealous, only quasi-talented man jealous of someone else's gifts. Meanwhile, Mozart is the character we should feel for and yet, throughout the whole movie (until the end), we want to kick him in the face. The movie opens many years after Mozart has died and Salieri, a once great composer, tries to commit suicide claiming he killed Mozart. The rest of the film is a flashback, as Salieri tells a priest the story. A story about how he longed for greatness and then saw the most brilliant musician of all time in the form of Mozart, a young man with an obnoxious personality and an annoying laugh. Salieri is jealous that these great gifts have been bestowed on such an immature person, he begins plotting to kill Mozart...But not until he's acquired some of the man's final writings. Anyway, enough with the synopsis because I'm pretty sure you've already heard it anyway. The movie is, obviously, a period piece and it does have lavish costumes and people writing with feathers. I know a good many people who won't watch a movie for those reasons, but "Amadeus" feels extraordinarily modern. Forman, a Czechoslovakian director who made films there and then came to America to great success, is a great director and this film is one of his greatest triumphs. It's funny, has great dialogue, and the performances are (once again) DYNAMITE! Even though Abraham won the Academy Award, Hulce could have just as easily scooped it up. I think, in the end, it's not that one performance is better than the other...It's just that Hulce is really annoying and Abraham is just incredible. Even people who aren't fans of Mozart (I've never listened to him myself) or aren't fans of these kinds of movies, I promise that you won't regret watching this film.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

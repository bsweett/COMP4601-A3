<meta name="summary" content="Highly original"></head><body><p>Often touted as a horror movie &#65533;The Others&#65533; is actually a gently creeping period piece.  Set in 1945 on the island of Jersey, Grace (Kidman) and her two children live by themselves in a lonely house surrounded by fog and bad weather.  After all the servants suddenly leave in the night Grace hires three new ones, informing them that the windows and doors must always be closed to protect the two children, both of whom are allergic to daylight.  Things begin to unravel as one of the children claims to see a little boy and his family and mysterious things start happening around the house.<p>What makes this movie particularly special is the fact that it sets its audience on edge rather than outright scares them.  A claustrophobic atmosphere is built up as the characters are all literally kept behind closed doors and the dingy photography depicts the monotonous life that the family lead.  However, it is Kidman that really holds it together.  Giving a blistering performance of a woman on the edge of insanity, desperate to retain her decorum whilst the absence of her husband gnaws at her.  Definitely very different to her role as a courtesan in &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533;, this shows what breadth the actress has, which anyone who has watched &#65533;To Die For&#65533; will know.  Thankfully the rest of the cast are very good indeed, especially the two children.<p>The feeling of mystery and locked-away feelings is evoked well as we&#65533;re given pieces of the puzzle gradually throughout the film.  Furthermore, &#65533;The Others&#65533; has created a whole new genre in its reliance of flesh-crawling creepiness rather than gratuitous gore.  It certainly makes a refreshing change and is all the better for having an actress of Kidman&#65533;s calibre on board.</p></body></html>

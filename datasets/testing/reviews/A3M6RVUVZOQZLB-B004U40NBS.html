<meta name="summary" content="A psychological thriller!"></head><body><p>Director Darren Aronofsky brilliantly explores the psychological landscape of one Nina Sayres (a perfect name for a ballet star) in his grand opus, "Swan Lake." I give a standing ovation and five stars (actually four and one half but clicking five out of necessity)!<br /><br />This is a film seemingly about ballet, the ballet world and its backstabbing and jealousies. It's a film about competition, both individual and between individuals. It's about mother-daughter conflicts. It's about the power of a male boss over his female employees.<br /><br />However, "Swan Lake" is, foremost, the setting for a psychological thriller which details the mind of one character, Nina. She is the unfortunate daughter of a former ballet dancer who had to quit the business because of pregnancy. What this mother did was shift her failed dreams upon her hapless and weak daughter. Nina is not normal. It doesn't take the audience long to understand why and how.<br /><br />The star of the ballet "Swan Lake" can be danced by two women or by one with dual roles. The swans are dichotomous: one pure, virginal, innocent; the other evil, passionate, sensual. Nina is the perfect white swam, but the director wants to choose someone to dance both roles. Because of her perfect technique, Nina finally wins the role with a promise to the director and his own determination that she will, indeed, be a great black swan and all it implies.<br /><br />But, alas, Nina is sooooo conflicted, so conflicted, in fact, that she is hallucinating. That old man on the subway is not making lewd gestures toward her.  Because her single focus in life is ballet, she has repressed, unknowingly, her needs and desires. Repression can behave in bizarre ways.<br /><br />Once she earns the role, Nina's repression causes more problems than hallucinations. A rash breaks out. She peels pieces of flesh from her fingers, only to discover that she didn't. A new dancer tries to befriend Nina. Finally, in a confrontation with her mother, she chooses the friend and goes out to party. Influenced by drugs and alcohol and a loosening of her inhibitions, Nina hallucinates a big one: She and the friend have a passionate sex scene.<br /><br />And so it goes. This is Nina, reaching the climax of her life--the epitome. She has already watched what happens to an aging star who previously danced this role. It's an ugly scenario. She lives with a mother who is bitter because she could no longer dance. What's a girl to do?<br /><br />Nina finally pierces her core to find what it takes to dance the Black Swan and wins a standing ovation. At what cost?<br /><br />I would like to leave my review at the previous paragraph, but I cannot. I accepted the director's use of surreal hallucinations as realistic, coming from a very repressed, rigid mindset with one single purpose in life: to dance. What I cannot accept is the act that pulls the passion from Nina's deepest self to win highest accolades from the director and the audience. Aronofsky made me accept Nina's pitiful existence and the deranged visions, but not the final physical act. Nope.<br /><br />Does Natalie Portman deserve her Academy award? It is certainly a performance worthy of the award. To maintain that magnitude of fear and even terror and repression and uncertainty over the weeks of filming is surely a feat of willpower in itself. In today's market of many very talented female actors, I don't know if Portman is THE one. Not having seen the other movies yet, I cannot be definitive, but Portman as Nina is certainly a contender.</p></body></html>

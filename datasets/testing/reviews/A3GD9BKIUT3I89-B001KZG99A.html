Now that Marvel has it's fate in it's own hands, we should see some positive results and nothing as bad as Daredevil, Elektra, the Punisher and the Fantastic Four!  IRON MAN is the first of their own films and their plans are ambitious to say the least.  No film in 2009 but 2010 will have IRON MAN 2 and THOR. 2011 will have CAPTAIN AMERICA and THE AVENGERS.  It will be interesting to see if the latter beats JLA to the big screen.</p></body></html>

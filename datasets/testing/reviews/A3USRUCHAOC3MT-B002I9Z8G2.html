<meta name="summary" content="Possibly The Best Star Trek Movie?"></head><body><p>One editorial review is right:  the even numbers are better.<br /><br />There is a Next Generation episode which shares the name "First Contact", but the only common thread is the contact with a planet and those outside.  Actually, the emphasis is not as much on the first contact but the battle to allow it to be so.<br /><br />SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS!  I found elements of different movies in this story, especially hints to Star Treks III (destroying the Enterprise) and IV (going back in time and telling select earth people something about the future).  Sometimes, it takes away from the originality of the story, but this is an exception.<br /><br />Unlike Generations, this movie developed the teamwork that made this series and all other Star Treks.  However, the movie gets right into the action.<br /><br />I find the Borg the most disturbing of the Star Trek villains, and this fit the bill.  Alice Krige was excellent in her role.<br /><br />There are themes that were great in this movie.  For example, the friendship between Captain Picard and Data and sacrifice.  The issue of revenge and obsession.  The issue of submission to authority and the boldness to take risks when necessary.  The fact that people we look up to as heroes are just ordinary people like you and I who are motivated by the same things we are (or maybe not as high a motivation).  As a Christian, I can see spiritual warfare implications in the movie, as well as illustrations of pitfalls we believers can fall into.</p></body></html>

"American Psycho" is a satirical horror film that had greater potential  than was realized.  Mary Harron's adaptation and direction seems to be the  problem.  Part of the story was a lampoon of the excessive materialism of  the 1980's, focusing particularly on the yuppie lifestyle.  That should  have served as the background for the character study.  However, Harron  pushed it to the foreground and exaggerated the portrayals of yuppie  superficiality and arrogance to the point where it became sophomoric.  She  then pounded on the point until it was threadbare.<p>The film would have  benefited from more development of Bateman's tortured inner self rather  than this obsession with his and his friends' way of life.  The story  presented an opportunity for a fresh approach to the horror genre.  Most  horror films are presented from the perspective of the victims, whereas  this story was from the killer's perspective.  In addition, since it was a  first person narrative, we had an opportunity to look inside the killer's  head.  Though some of that was done, too much of the introspection focused  on his thoughts about his lifestyle and not enough on his feelings about  the people he was killing or the acts themselves.<p>The acting by Bale was  excellent.  Though I didn't agree with Harron's vision of Bateman as the  poster child for yuppie conceit and tawdriness, Christian Bale played the  caricature to the hilt.  He was more pompous, supercilious and decadent  than your typical Roman Emperor.  The scene depicting his emotional  disintegration was terrifically done and very intense.<p>Overall, the way  the story was presented created an air of incredulity about all the  characters and their behavior which took the effectiveness out of the  psychological angle.  That left us with a mindless horror flick with only  mediocre effects.  Despite some excellent acting, I rated this film a 4/10.  A directorial hack job marred a good story concept.  Since it failed  miserably at the box office, the film's best hope is that it becomes a cult  classic in rental.  It is kitsch enough for that to be a distinct  possibility.</p></body></html>

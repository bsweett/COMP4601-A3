<meta name="summary" content="An Enjoyable Sequel With Promise Of Another Film. Great Action/Storyline. Leaves Me Waiting For "Pirates Of The Caribbean 3.""></head><body><p>This action-packed sequel to the 2003 Walt Disney Pictures hit "Pirates Of The Caribbean" is crammed to the brim with a great storyline, spectacular action scenes (especially one terrific swordfight atop a mill wheel), awesome special effects, good performances and, as usual, Disney humor. I won't spoil the storyline, for the sake of those who haven't seen it, but I will say one thing. If you loved the first movie, which grossed $650 million (so far, this film has grossed $361 million, with a budget of $225 million), you will enjoy this one even more. Keira Knightley is as charming as ever and her performance is well-done, exuding greater empathy and fire. Orlando Bloom is good as Ms. Knightley. Jack Davenport, looking more like Pierce Brosnan in the torture scenes from "Die Another Day," is good. However, this movie is entirely Johnny Depp's. Having seen him in the family-friendly J.M. Barrie biopic "Finding Neverland" and the first "Pirates," he has proven his worth to me as an actor. Ms. Knightley proves herself worthy of holding her own in period pieces and against her male co-stars. I love this movie.<br /><br />Word to parents: Despite Walt Disney Pictures producing this wonderful movie, this film is darker than the original and is therefore not suitable for very young children (depending on their tolerance for the heavy material, of course; thanks, in part to Jerry Bruckheimer-"Pearl Harbor," "Remember The Titans"- and the excellent script by Ted Eliott and Terry Rossio-the writers behind the smash box-office hits "Aladdin" and "The Mask Of Zorro"). This film, along with the first movie, should have been rated PG. The violence (period-style swordfights) isn't graphic (you'd expect that from Walt Disney Pictures, a company which prides itself, and made its name on, family-friendly entertainment; the camera cuts away before any graphic execution takes place) and there is absolutely no language or sexual content (the cleavage shown in the films is consistent with the period in which the films are set-England in the 1600's). Walt Disney is still riding high. Watch for "Pirates Of The Caribbean 3: At World's End" due out next summer. Rated PG for action-adventure violence.</p></body></html>

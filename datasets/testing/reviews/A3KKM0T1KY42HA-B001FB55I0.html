<meta name="summary" content="In Need of Salvation"></head><body><p>Regardless of whether you get the Director's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version of Terminator Salvation, you're in for an average movie viewing experience at best. I was certainly entertained. I love the Terminator movies...especially T1 and T2. I know a lot folks hated T3; I for one did not hate T3. T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2, but it wasn't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound. No, I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average...in their own unique ways.<br /><br />And I'll tell ya, it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie? Have you heard that? Oh my God, what a chump. Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale. And you've got to give props to Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese too; Yelchin almost made me think he was really a young Michael Biehn (the guy who played Reese in the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9RB9Y">Terminator</a>.<br /><br />But the story in Salvation didn't come close to living up to what Terminator or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIY4WE">Terminator 2:</a> delivered. Salvation's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations, and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations. How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series? Maybe he didn't teeny-bop Salvation, but it was very weeknight CW networked up.<br /><br />Bottom line: Terminator Salvation is a rental</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Da Vinci Code"></head><body><p>I'm probably one of the few people in America who haven't read Dan Brown's novel "The Da Vinci Code." The novel was a bestseller for, at least, a couple of years and I knew when I saw the book riding high on the bestseller list that a movie was inevitable. I gave up on going to read the book when I heard about the movie. After all, the movie had to be good. It starred two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks and French actress Audrey Tatou ('Amelie'), was directed by Oscar winner Ron Howard, and written by Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman. The movie came out and something strange happened. It got lukewarm reviews from critics and, judging by the reviews on Amazon, people don't like the movie much either. Keeping in mind that I've never read the book, I don't know how it holds up to the movie...But I got to say. I liked this movie, it's not perfect. But it's pretty good. The movie stars Hanks as Professor Robert Langdon, an expert on symbols. While doing what appears to be a book signing in France, he's brought into a gallery to identify symbols that have been carved into a murdered man's body. The man is Jacques Sauniere, a man Langdon was scheduled to have a drink with that very day. The murder scene is a bit strange, since Sauniere was shot and carved the symbols into his body himself. While Langdon is questioned by Captain Fache (Jean Reno), a young woman named Sophie Neveu (Tatou) arrives and warns Langdon that he's the suspect in the murder of Sauniere. The man who happens to be her grandfather. As they scramble for clues, they find a message from Sauniere that fuels the rest of the movie. A lot of the stuff that occurs later in this movie would be considered a "twist" in most films, but due to all the controversy surrounding it's subject, everyone knows what's happening. As you know, Langdon and Sophie are looking for the Holy Grail which is not, as rumored, a cup...It's a person. The spawn of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Standing in their way is a murderous albino rabbi named Silas (an evil-looking Paul Bettany, in one of his best performances) and an Opus Dei bishop (Alfred Molina, 'Spider-Man 2'). Also helping Langdon and Sophie in their search is Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen, who's great here), a cripple who's an expert on all things religious. This movie has caused controversy for everything. The fact that it contradicts religion, the fact that an albino is the villain, the fact that Opus Dei is portrayed incorrectly. What people don't realize is that Dan Brown was not writing a history novel and Ron Howard is not making a non-fiction film. This movie is meant to be pure fiction, existing solely for the purpose of entertaining the masses. As for entertainment value, The Da Vinci Code has its highs and lows. It can be very entertaining one moment and seem never-ending the next. I was impressed by how much research went into the writing of this stuff. Even though it's fiction, it seems thoroughly researched. The performances are strong, the action scenes are well filmed, and the movie has great cinematography and art direction. I don't think we'll see it mentioned come Oscar time, but it's a nice thought-provoking way to pass the time.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></body></html>

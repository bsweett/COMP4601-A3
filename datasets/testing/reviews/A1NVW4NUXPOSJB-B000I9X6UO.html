Filmed in only 10 days, it's for this fact a great performance.Colin Farrell surpasses himself and it's also in itself a performance. The plot is well temperated.Just think what you will do if it happened to you, nothing less or more than what you can see in the film. There is no useless heroism like in most of the Hollywood movies, no smarter guy, no super cop, no super hero, no moral and a very good movie at the end. For once, Hollywood shows no more than the reality and I hope we will be able to see more movies like that !</p></body></html>

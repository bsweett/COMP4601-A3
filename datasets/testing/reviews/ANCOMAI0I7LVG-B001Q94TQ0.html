<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes reality is the toughest pill to swallow..."></head><body><p>I got into a heated debate with a friend the other day about the difference between subtlety and lifelessness.  He got all up in arms when I labeled Ed Harris's nomination for `The Truman Show' a joke.  Now as many of you know, I love the movie, but I felt that Harris really added nothing to the film.  He was less subtle and more hollow.  So, when he said that I wouldn't appreciate subtleness if it hit me in the face I rattled off this little film and told him to bask in the glory that is Catalina Sandino Moreno and her brilliant use of subtle forcefulness.  So, we watched the film together, and my adoration of her performance was deepened and I think I made my point.<br /><br />This performance may be quiet, but it is in no way shape or form `hollow'.<br /><br />`Maria, Llena Eres de Gracia' is a brilliant film, truly, from start to finish one of the most honest and raw films I have seen in recent years.  The film feels so natural, which only adds to the emotional destruction the audience goes through while watching it.  There is nothing that feels Hollywoodized or embellished in that overly dramatic heavy handed way that most films are done today.  It is simply raw and gritty and truth; pure truth.<br /><br />Here we are told the story of young Maria, a seventeen-year-old Columbian who lives with her mother and grandmother, her sister and her young nephew.  She works hard every day dethroning flowers only to pay more than her share at home.  When Maria winds up pregnant she is faced with a decision.  Her boyfriend isn't the marrying type, and her job is less that satisfactory so she decides to leave town and try to find work elsewhere.  That is when she is given the opportunity to make some quick and `easy' money.  She is asked to become a mule, swallowing pellets of heroine and smuggling them into the states.  She accepts, and her harrowing journey is one of danger, fear and ultimately self awakening.<br /><br />The film, much like Moreno, is very subtle.  There is nothing here that is over-the-top or any mere scene that begs for your attention the way that most films produced today do.  The story is told in a very focused yet very earnest way.  We see everything (almost everything) in a very point-blank manor.  Nothing is glamorized, nothing is sugar-coated; nothing is depicted as anything other than reality.  I think I first realized this when Maria has to wash off pellets after she went to the bathroom and then re-swallow them in the airplane bathroom.<br /><br />Fearless.<br /><br />I want to take a minute to applaud the Academy for nominating Moreno back in 2004 for Best Lead Actress.  I often give the Academy a hard time for nominating gimmicky and obvious performances that take no imagination and really require no stretch of talent, but in 2004 they nominated five VERY worthy performances (albeit handing possibly the least worthy the award).  Catalina Sandino Moreno delivers such a spellbindingly pure performance, never reaching too far and coming off as forced but always keeping her characters innocence and naivety a central part of her performance.  Maria is sincere and genuine, yet confused and determined.  This reads beautifully on the screen.  She is gives such a radiant performance, one that is nuanced to perfection and such a dynamic force without being abrupt and outlandish.<br /><br />First time actress Moreno (yes, this is her DEBUT performance) and newcomer writer/director Joshua Marston (he had one credit under his belt before this) are a brilliant team who mesh so well with one another to create a film that reaches the heart and stirs the emotions and will remain utterly unforgettable.  Watching Maria grow as a person throughout this treacherous journey may be hard to take, but in the end the reward is beautiful beyond words.</p></body></html>

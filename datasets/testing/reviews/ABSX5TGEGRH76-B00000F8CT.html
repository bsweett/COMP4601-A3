She saw it on TV, and so it was smaller, quieter, and had many things cut out.  She wasn't too scared.  Anyway, I saw Alien for the first time on TV as well, but it was on a movie channel, so nothing was cut out.  Still, it wasn't the horror film that I had heard it to be.<br /><br />The plot deals with the crew of an interstellar towing ship called the Nostromo.  The seven people work for "the company", and they are returning to Earth with a shipment of ore.  On the way home, the ship receives a sigal, which awakens the crew from hyper-sleep.  Their contracts say that any SOS must be checked out, so they do, for they believe the signal to be an SOS.  Except for one person on the ship, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver).  Three crew members explore the planet's surface, and they find a big cavernous room that houses hundreds of weird egg-like objects.  When one of the eggs hatches, a small creature emerges, and attatches itself to Kane's (John Hurt) face.  This is why it is known to many as the "face-hugger".  The trio defies quarantine procedure and returns to the ship in an attempt to save Kane.  They try to cut the face-hugger off, but its blood is acidic.  It appears to be at least 10 times as acidic as hydrochloric acid, one of the most powerful acids known to man.  Eventually, the face-hugger dies, and Kane is revived.  Soon however, a new creature bursts out of his chest (i.e. the "chest-burster"), and runs away.  It very quickly grows into a man-sized monster with large claws, acidic blood, a mouth full of teeth, and a smaller head filled with teeth inside its mouth.  One by one, it kills of the crew, until only one remains.<br /><br />For 1979, the special effects were pretty good.  The acting was fairly strong, and the story was interesting.  There was only one major plot twist but it was a good one.<br /><br />Finally, I must say that the description of the alien as a "perfect creature" is almost true.  It has an amazing defense mechanism, the acid-blood.  Unless one kills it without piercing its skin, the killer probably won't last too long either.  It can adapt to nearly any environment, even a vacuum.  Finally, even the way it breeds is deadly to its enemies.  First, there is an egg.  The egg hatches and a face-hugger is born.  The face-hugger finds a host and attatches itself to its mouth and nose.  It keeps the host alive and deposits and fertilizes a chest-burster embryo in the host's midsection.  The face-hugger then dies and falls off.  The chest-burster gestates in the host's chest, then kills the host as it emerges.  If the chest-burster turns out to be a queen, it lays eggs, and the cycle begins anew.<br /><br />Finally, I have often heard that this is a very scary movie, but my heart-rate only increased once during the movie.  It was at the end, and it didn't have to do with the alien.  Oh well, it was still a pretty good movie.</p></body></html>

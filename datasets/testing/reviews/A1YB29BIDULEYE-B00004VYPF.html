A previous reviewer put it quite well when he said that while the movie makes fun of the silent film era, it also shows a respectful nostalgia towards it.<br /><br />Gene Kelly seems to have made an art out of covering his coincidental rise to fame with a single word: "Dignity." Gene Kelly works with Lena who is beautiful enough for silent films. But her unrefined voice makes us aware that she will have a problem if movies go to sound.<br /><br />Gene Kelly later runs into Debby Reynolds. Their first meeting ends in a hilarious argument. If we know romances, we can sense that they will end up together. They later meet, and Kelly realizes that Reynolds is 'not so far above him.' But he is moved with compassion. (Perhaps due to his difficult past, he sees a parallel.)<br /><br />Later, we see that movies are going to sound. While this presents difficulties to all, Lena will have the most problems if she wants to keep her job. The only weak link here is that I don't like how Lena is often made the object of scorn. (All she really wants is to keep her job.) She's no saint to be sure, but is she really so bad for wanting to keep her job?<br /><br />Moving on, reynolds and Kelly meet again, and they begin working on a project together. We can see that the transition from silent films to talking films was not so easy. An especially hilarious moment is the miserable failure of the screen test (topped off by the sound going out of timing).<br /><br />But Reynolds and Kelly (former enemies) work together and find a way to save the movie. One thing that makes this movie so great is the harmonious mixture of speaking parts, singing, and dancing.<br /><br />One comical character worth mentioning is R.F. He gets a tad hypocritical: "Trust me, talking pictures will never amount to anything. They'll lose their shirts." Later, he says: "I told you talking pictures were a menace, but no one would listen."<br /><br />In many ways, this film is a great treasure.</p></body></html>

Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for "Chaplin" and for a Golden Globe in 2000 for TV's "Ally McBeal."  As weapons dealer Tony Stark, he moves from the hard-nosed wheeler dealer to a man with a conscience.  I understood why Jeff Bridges' character Obadiah Stane would want to remove him after he has a conscience, but wasn't altogether clear why he wanted to get rid of Tony when he was a money maker.  Perhaps it was jealousy.  The great humor that Downey brings to the role, particularly with his eccentric machine that keeps wanting to spray him to put out fires, makes the action all the better.  There is also a hint of romance with Pepper Potts played by Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow for 1998's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGOH">Shakespeare in Love</a>.  Terrence Howard has been a favorite actor of mine since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a> and his Oscar-nominated role in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BITUWU">Hustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Perhaps one of the best parts is played by Shaun Toub who shined in the Oscar winning "Crash" as the Iranian store clerk.  In captivity, Stark meets Toub's Yinsen who becomes his assistant and sacrifices himself for Tony.  Faran Tahir as the rebel leader Raza is excellent.  John Favreau who is currently acting in "Four Christmases" directs the film and keeps the pace breakneck.  This is a great action/special effects picture.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

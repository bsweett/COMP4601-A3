<meta name="summary" content="4 ?+ Stars: Powerful Performances will Make You "Doubt"..."></head><body><p>Based on the award-winning play and adapted for the screen by John Patrick Shanley, who also directs this film, "DOUBT" is a riveting, powerful film full of raw emotional drama that registers as something truly worthy of praise. It has been made outstanding by the exceptional performances that would give you goose bumps and enough meat to talk about after the first viewing. It is just a film almost impossible to ignore with its superb direction, beautiful but simple cinematography--truly an awesome blend of solid storytelling and powerful performances. I was truly awed.<br /><br />A year after the Kennedy assassination, in a Catholic church with a school in its grounds, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a progressive priest with ideas that defy tradition. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is a traditional nun who is also the school's principal, who believes in protecting and preserving known rules and old-school beliefs. The two are meant for a battle of wills and on the sidelines is na?ve sister James (Amy Adams). When Sister James brings her observations to Sister Aloysius about the things she had seen about a lone African-American student, Donald. The school principal is pushed to believe that Father Flynn may have an undesirable relationship with the young student, without the benefit of solid evidence. Flynn denies the charges that leads the elder nun to pursue an audience with Donald's mother (played by Viola Davis), leaving Sister James confused and the matter eating away at her conscience...<br /><br />I know what you're thinking--who is right and who is wrong? Did Flynn really molest the boy? With the film's very strong Catholic overtone, the direction presents a very suffocating screenplay. Both Father Flynn and Sister Aloysius appear to have the best interests of the boy in mind, both characters are sympathetic and believable; even Sister James have her heart in the right place. I suppose if there are any bad guys in this film, it would be our own PERCEPTION. It sends us to a wild moody set piece that bring us to the uttermost places of uncertainty.<br /><br />Catholic authority is also somewhat called into play as this church is obviously one divided by gender (as illustrated with the separate scenes of social intermingling at dinner). One may think that Aloysius has the motivation to grab power from Flynn, the script effectively represents the psychological dissertation between our two main characters. The film goes into the opposing viewpoints--things that need to be changed within the confines of the rectory and things that need preserving. It was a nice to touch to see Aloysius annoyed when Flynn wanted sugar in his tea. Both sides have a point, but it is difficult to take a side and nor does Shanley point an accusing finger. The dialogue is very strong and the material is well structured; the screenplay is very enthralling as it takes the viewer to behavioral actions that provokes our curiosity. Director Shanley also takes a look at the premise and methodically shows the larger picture, at the same time it kept on generating a strong uneasy feeling that can get under your skin.<br /><br />The lingering suspicion is powerfully played to its fullest and I will be honest, it is driving me crazy. The excellently staged exchanges of dialogue between Streep and Hoffman are truly awe-inspiring. I have always loved both performers and this movie just justifies my reasons as to why. The more they bicker and argue the more the truth becomes cloudy. The two have good reason to protect the details from each other's eyes, and I have to commend the script by Shanley; he obviously chose the words carefully--with the sole purpose of confusing, provoking our senses and engaging the viewer in its sequences.<br /><br />Aside from Hoffman and Streep's exchanges, there is also a very emotionally charged exchange with Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis), Donald's mother. That scene almost made my jaw drop as I was very moved with their conversation. Donald is a child with a huge problem--is Father Davis helping or is he taking advantage? Sister James doesn't think so after she had a conversation with Father Flynn in the garden. Amy James does feel a little too ditzy, and I guess that is just the way her character needed to be portrayed. The film is just a marvelous roller coaster of emotional exchanges and when you have such performers as Hoffman and Streep, you will have to prepare to be absolutely impressed.<br /><br />"Doubt" has marvelous writing that fabulously challenges the viewer to question and well, "doubt" the film's resolution. Shanley made a wise move in not dissecting the truth, and express the insidiousness of rumors and gossip. It also makes a bold statement about faith, tradition and trust that sometimes we need to listen and restrain our potential for damaging perceptions; and Shanley amazingly does so without discrediting religion. "Doubt" is a powerful motion picture since I am certain that I will be pondering its final act long after the end credits stop rolling. Those who like their moral dramas with an absolute resolution may be a little disappointed, but for those who doesn't mind pondering what they've seen are in for a treat. I like films that leave me asking questions, it is a welcome departure from the usual Hollywood fare that spoon-feeds the answers.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!! [4 ?+ Stars]</p></body></html>

However, it's unfortunate that that's all the film really was. Other than Angelina Jolie beating the snot out of men twice her size for an hour and a half, the film offered little else.<br /><br />It makes sense that children who are trained to be Russian spies while they're young would be capable of doing extraordinary things that the average human being wouldn't be able to, but Salt seemed borderline superhuman at times. The ability to handle various firearms and making homemade bombs out of cleaning supplies is one thing, but climbing around skyscrapers and bouncing off the walls like Spider-Man seemed like a bit of a stretch. The way she'd steal things as she was passing by came off as more of an unlikely repeated occurrence of both luck and convenience rather than a skillful attribute.<br /><br />The storyline is also ridiculously outlandish. It includes such gems as Lee Harvey Oswald actually being a Russian spy named Alek and a rather predictable plot twist in the climax. One of the weakest parts of the film is how inconclusive Salt's motifs come off as. The film was probably trying to keep you guessing as to whether or not Salt was actually a spy up until the big reveal, but her actions appear more confusing than anything and are relatively unclear until the end. Then her reasoning behind her actions just seemed so one-dimensional and dull that you wonder why you even bothered to watch this thriller to begin with. Not to mention that the film has a bigger open-ending than Predators did earlier this year.<br /><br />Salt does deliver some fast paced, bone crunching action and features an incredibly strong female lead, but its preposterous and predictable storyline drags it down. Salt is way too similar to everything else Angelina Jolie has done to go out of your way and see. The bottom line is the film treads familiar ground that you've already seen before and has probably been done better. If you're dead set on seeing Salt, I strongly encourage you to wait until it hits DVD and Blu-ray. Otherwise, skip it altogether.</p></body></html>

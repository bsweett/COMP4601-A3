<meta name="summary" content="Hell hath no fury like Cage!"></head><body><p>Ghost Rider is a pretty decent movie. With all the other reviews on here there is no need to go into detail about the plot. Cage does a nice job of playing Blaze. The "killings" were pretty cool, and the bike looked pretty cool. The cgi for the Rider isn't so good. Overall though it is a pretty decent movie and well worth a watch! If you plan on watching Ghost Rider along with Spirit of Vengeance, I can't really recommend that because, the story lines don't really go together. I see Spirit of Vengeance as more of a reboot than a sequel, but both are definitely worth a watch as long as you watch them as two separate movies!</p></body></html>

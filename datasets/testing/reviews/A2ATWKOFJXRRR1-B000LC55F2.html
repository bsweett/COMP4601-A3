<meta name="summary" content="Revenge To The End"></head><body><p>If one had to pare down THE PRESTIGE to two words, they would undoubtedly be "dark" and "twisted." Coming from director Christopher Nolan, who gave us the BATMAN BEGINS gem, this shouldn't surprise anyone. Nolan is also responsible for the successful somewhat underground-ish film, MEMENTO, another flick that fits perfectly within those two pared-down words.<br /><br />Similar in style to THE ILLUSIONIST, but with much more substance, The Prestige has a unique flow and some surprisingly good acting from previously unknown places.<br /><br />Like Memento, the story jumps around time-wise, going from present tense, to past, then even further past before heading back to present tense (excuse the use of literary style rather than film, as this seems to also apply here), director Nolan has given us a study in revenge based on the lives of two fictitious magicians in the late 1800s. They are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman, THE FOUNTAIN), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale, BATMAN BEGINS). Initially friends who's relationship is shattered by the death of Robert's wife after a terrible on-stage accident, the two become mortal enemies in a one-upmanship that leads to bad ends for both men.<br /><br />The two opponents are willing to do whatever it takes in order to be the best magicians in the world. This often entails "getting one's hands dirty." Severing body parts, breaking one another's bones, and using anything and anyone to further their goals is a necessary evil.<br /><br />Double, triple, and quadruple-crosses await the viewer in this stark but beautifully filmed movie. The sets are awe-inspiring (in their own dark way) and each shot given plenty of thought with regards to shadow and contrasts.<br /><br />The big winners for the film, though, are the script and a surprisingly excellent performance by David Bowie as the genius (and real life) inventor Nikola Tesla. Melding fiction with nonfiction was a nice touch and added to the overall concept of the film.<br /><br />Many may be able to figure out "the big secret" long before it's revealed (this reviewer was able to deduce it rather easily), but this won't take away from the enjoyment of the film going experience. The great acting, moody sets, and applaudable screenplay will keep most viewers enthralled regardless.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="simply put, a masterpiece"></head><body><p>easily the best movie of 2006 (well, of those ive seen).  this is a brilliant fairy tale about a young girl verging back and forth between a pair of horror-filled worlds: one of reality (a wicked stepfather in early franco-era spain) and the other of fantasy (a puzzling tempter urging her on to an act of ultimate evil).  the film is replete with visual images you cannot forget: poisonings, casual shootings, freakish nightmares, &c.  i will avoid specifying any of them (dont want to be accused of sppoilers), but this is a movie you MUST see, and that will stay with you.</p></body></html>

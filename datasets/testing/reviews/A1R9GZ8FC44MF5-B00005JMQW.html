<meta name="summary" content="Best Comic book Movie So Far."></head><body><p>It improves on the first in almost every way, except for explosions.  The first had more explosions but this one has much better fight sequences, that are intense and very well choreographed, esspecially the clock tower and train fight.  The finale could have been better though, maybe if the machine exploded instead of just goin underwater, and the last fight was longer, o well, the first has a better finale but the rest of this one is better.  This one also has a better performance from Tobey(who is definetly goin places) who shows he could be the best new actor out there besides Colin Farrel maybe.  This ones also very funny and made me laugh more then any stupid comedy out there(comedies suck).  Its dramatic and well thought out, the action rules, and the story is deep, this is by far the best super hero movie so far in the history of cinema( Batman sucks his not even a superhero, so do the movies) see this movie, if you dont you will miss on a great time, i give it a 8 out of a 10, if only the finale was better, i cant wait for the spiderman 2.5 dvd, hopefully the add more to the end.</p></body></html>

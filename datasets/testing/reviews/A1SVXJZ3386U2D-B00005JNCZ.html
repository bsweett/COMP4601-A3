I was concerned that the movie would try to get me to "accept" the path that Guevera's life took in later years.  This movie stated from the beginning that this was not it's intention by saying it was just the story of two friends on a trip together; nothing else.  Although the concluding remarks referred to his later years, the events portrayed in this movie could have inspired a positive change in the lives of many "mainstream" persons including ourselves.<br /><br />That aside, let me say that this is a GREAT movie.  It's one of those movies that makes you wonder if you've graded too many others with a "5 star" rating: there just aren't all that many out there as good as "Motorcyle Diaries".  The scope of the movie, the message it conveys and the many subtle ways it conveys it, the quality of the acting, the excellence of the directing, the supurb film editing, and, especially, the excellence of its' cinematography; all these come together in nothing short of a masterpiece.  It is the story of two young men who, in 1952, decide to take a motorcycle trip through South America.  They start in their home town of Buenos Aires, Argentina, head south then over to Chile and up eventually to Venezuela.  All of this on a shoe string budget.<br /><br />The beauty of the film is how Ernesto (Che) Guevara gradually becomes enlightened to the many injustices of the world through his own personal experiences.  It begins with a sense of knowing what it is like to be to be perceived as a member of the "lower" class.  We get enough of a background in the beginning to understand that Ernesto and his cousin are from at least the upper middle class.  Yet, in their beat up motorcycle and meager possessions, they are perchieved as less by their economic peers.  This treatment affects Ernesto and starts to open his eyes to other injustices.  In Chile, he and his cousin nearly meet their end at the hands of Chilean men who believe that they have insulted the honor of one ot their women.  The shouts of "Let's get those Argentine @#%$**@#'s" gave Ernesto a perception on the injustice of political borders seperating people of the same race and culture.  In the mining region of Northern Chile he is hit with a sense of the economic injustices of the haves vs the have nots.  This is exacerbated by the knowledge that the larger land owners have muscled out the smaller land owners pushing them into poverty and dependence.  Ultimately they come to their primary destination; a leper colony in Amazonian Peru.  Even there exists a hierarchy based on health and position as well as an unnecessary seperation based on prejudice and arrogance.  At the end of his journey, Ernesto recognizes that he is, indeed, a changed man.  We are changed as well.<br /><br />I let my defenses down midway through the movie when I realized that the screen writer had given us a reasonably accurate picture of life in South America in the 1950's.  Much of South America remains little changed from what was portrayed in "Motorcycle Diaries".  I lived in Chile one summer in 1969 and I can attest that poverty in South America makes poverty in North America appear to be life in the middle class.  I am not trying to demean our own impoverished in this coutry nor ignore their needs.  However, once you have seen the real poverty of Latin America, it touches you in a way that you cannot forget.  What Ernesto Guevara did with this knowledge is another story and the knowledge of those future actions need not interfere with enjoying this outstanding movie.<br /><br />The photography, as I mentioned, is outstanding.  From the Andes to the Amazon, we are treated to a view of a world we seldom see.  I was led to wonder just how great it would have been to see this film on the big screen.<br /><br />If I have any sort of objection to the movie, it is due to my overly practical nature.  These two men ran out of money early in their trip and had to make do finding help for food and lodging.  However, they always had gas in their engine even though they had no money and even though they traveled, by my estimation, many miles between gas stations.  Sorry, but that point seemed to always be in the back of my mind.<br /><br />The DVD I rented gave the English or Spanish option.  I chose the English option and got the sound in Spanish with English subtitles.  That didn't bother me but it may bother some.  It has been my experience that one tends to pay greater attention to a movie with subtitles because you don't let your eyes wander from the screen as much.  With Engligh language films you can go into the kitchen to grab something while listening to the dialogue or background music to cue you if things start to get intense.  With subtitles there is no time to do other things.  I don't think you'd want to be doing anything else while watching "Motorcycle Diaries".  This is a movie that commands all of our attention.</p></body></html>

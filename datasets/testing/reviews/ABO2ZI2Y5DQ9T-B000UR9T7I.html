<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Excellent Cast and Special Effects and ... Too Many Characters"></head><body><p>Much-awaited second sequel of "Spider-man" offers a lot of thrilling action sequences (as you expected), but sadly lacks a coherent story with one (or two, or maybe more) too many characters who should have been kept for another installment of the series. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy watching "Spider-man 3." Yes, I did, but at the same time while watching the film, I was thinking: "Did Sam Raimi really need two villains to make this film?" Actually I don't think "Sandman" is really a villain, but anyway, Spider-man has to fight this formidable enemy before fighting another one, more vicious and powerful Venom.<br /><br />The cast is all excellent, and the action scenes are exciting. The CGI-created Sandman (played by perfect Thomas Haden Church) is simply great, but I still don't know why some characters should re-appear here in this way. It is not a bad idea to show the tragic background story of Sandman and his family, or the estranged relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but the story of vengeful Harry Osborn and short-term memory loss puzzled me, which goes nowhere after all.<br /><br />Add to them, there are Peter's rival photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace, excellent too), Peter's new friend Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her father Captain Stacy (James Cromwell). Not only Aunt Parker re-appears to give kindly advice to Peter, but Uncle Parker is also seen again in the flashback scenes, and Bruce Campbell (always welcome) appears again. You need to be a skillful storyteller to handle all these characters, but even Christopher Nolan would find it hard to wrap up all these threads within 140 minute. And don't forget the Venom character which appears too late in the film and lovely Ursula who is totally wasted.<br /><br />"Spider-man 3" has great special effects and great cast, with which they could have made two "Spider-man" films.</p></body></html>

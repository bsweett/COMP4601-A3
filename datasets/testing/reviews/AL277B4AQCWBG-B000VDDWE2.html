But we can leave that one for the likes of Michael Moore to ponder.  Setting aside, too, the insulting "science" served up in this nonsensical faux-green potboiler, I could almost forgive Roland Emmerich for all of it if he'd made something that was even half-way entertaining.  Instead, he just does what he's best at - the wholesale destruction of American cities is yet again presented in lovingly rendered mind-blowing CGI.  And he does what he's worst at, too - attempts to tell a story.  This time, a fatuous family-values plot is grafted onto the three or four effects-intensive set pieces with all the seamless realism of your average Californian D-cup implant.  The result is a diabolically inept monstrosity of a film which lumbers from jaw-dropping visuals to lame attempts at tear-jerking with metronomic regularity.  Forty minutes in, I wanted everyone to die - including me.  I feel sorry for Gyllenhaal, Quaid and especially Ian Holm - three exceptionally talented actors.  The gravitas Holm brings to the few scenes he's in only demonstrates the banality of the rest of them.  Last year's "28 Days Later" was hardly a masterpiece, but it was vastly better than this.  Why?  Because it actually had something to say about mankind and the types of thinking and behaviour that might cause our destruction.  Emmerich's film says nothing.  That's no crime, but it's the lost opportunity I really resent.</p></body></html>

Look hard, and you can see the smile in Jones' film - especially in the half-daffy lead performance of Sam Rockwell. But you have to squint through the ponderous foreground.<br /><br />Rockwell is, appropriately, Sam, an employee of Lunar Industries, which mines a new helium energy source on the dark side of the moon. He's on the tail end of a three-year contract - accompanied only by an on-ship robot (named Gerty, voiced by Kevin Spacey) - communicating by tape with his wife and mission control, as the live feed seems permanently broken.<br /><br />Sam gets in a rover accident and wakes up in the infirmary...changed. He's younger. More alert. And Gerty - along with mission control - doesn't want him to perform his usual repairs outside. Why? And why did Gerty seem to be having a live conversation with mission control when Sam wandered out of his hospital room?<br /><br />"Moon" is 90 minutes long, but remains larded with filler. Mystery in space isn't the same as menace, and since "Moon" doesn't work as horror, we're left with a lot of stock shots of the lunar station, and Sam traveling from one part of it to another. There is no payoff when Sam talks to plants he's tending, or he whittles away at a wooden model of his hometown, and Jones hasn't yet developed a visual mastery that makes these images compelling (like Steven Soderbergh did in "Solaris"), and Jones lacked the budget and scope of Kubrick's "2001." "Moon" doesn't look cheap, but its fast-forward-through-this-scene quality points to it.<br /><br />The movie's big "reveal" is no stunner to the sci-fi veteran, although it gives Rockwell some elbow room. Already accomplished at depicting duality - "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," "Heist" and "Choke" reflect some of his best work - Rockwell has some fun fleshing out Sam's...many layers. But even these scenes grow tedious - a bit like an one-act play, with gizmos - as the audience squirms for the climax, which includes a rescue ship, a clever switcheroo, and a key sacrifice.<br /><br />Though it snuck its way onto a few end-of-year Top Ten lists, "Moon" is more fashionable than powerful. Kudos to Jones for taking a road less traveled, but here's to a bigger budget and stronger story for his next foray into the genre.</p></body></html>

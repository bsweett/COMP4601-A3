As Evelyn Salt, who is a CIA agent on the run after being accused of being a double agent for the Russians. Superb production values along with some very superb twists, turns, car chases and action make this fare palatable. Philip Noyce, the director has promised a sequel. Four stars. 2/25/11</p></body></html>

The Ghost Rider Comics are famous and just like Spiderman and X-Men; to make an adaptation out of it requires a lot of work. It's not something you can easily slap on the big screen; both longtime fans and newcomers have to find the same power that makes Ghost Rider what it is in the comics, on the big screen. So having seen this I admit that although it had a few sore spots and kinks, I admire the work put into the movie.<br /><br />Nic Cage is pretty good in being Johnny Blaze and Ghost Rider. He adds much needed charisma to the movie and the emotional romance which was fairly traditional. Some of the superhero battles are neither sophisticated nor fantastic, to the point on making a grade. Eva Mendez was simply stunning and has out-standing beauty, but never had much chance to do anything ground breaking in this movie. The villain in the movie let the side down; Wes and Peter were both below par with their efforts similar to Eva. Sam Elliot was great even though he didn't have much to play with. I felt he was the only person who stayed in character and delivered his role gracefully throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />Special effects were very good considering the tight budget constraints; the direction was adequate if nothing stunning. Script was awful along with the plot, but to be expected in a comic book movie that tries to be nothing else other than a comic book movie not like the fantastic Batman Begins and Spider-man. This could have been another film in the vein of the Blade series instead of being a PG-13 safe movie viewing. A real shame here as I like the Ghost Rider character (though I've never read the comics). This could have been a great new series for fans missing their Blade style comic movie. Playing it save with a PG-13 script on subject matter that is truly R all the way really hurt this one!! Beside that it's a good effort and is still worth watching on big screen.</p></body></html>

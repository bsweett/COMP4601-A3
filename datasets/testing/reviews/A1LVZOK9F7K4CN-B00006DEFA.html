<meta name="summary" content="They could have fit it on one disc..."></head><body><p>THE DVD:  If you like this movie at all, it MUST be viewed on DVD (or in the theater of course).  Not only is this one of the best SOUNDING movies of all time - with Neville Mariner's wonderful renditions of Mozart's music - it is also on of the best LOOKING movies ever filmed.  As the documentary shows, it was filmed in Prague -which is the most eighteenth-century-looking city in Europe.  The film would be ruined in pan-and-scan - you need letterbox to be able to take in the breathtaking compositions.  The film looks and sounds great.  <p>That having been said, I don't think that they needed to offer a "two disc" edition.  The ONLY thing on the second disc is the documentary, which could have easily fitted on the first disc.  This is merely another instance of the studio jacking up the price by offering a "two disc special edition."<p>THE DIRECTOR'S CUT:  Amadeus was a long movie to begin with; now, with the extra footage, it clocks in at almost exactly three hours.  This is a LONG movie.  However, having now seen both versions, the Director's Cut does make more sense.  For instance, we get to see what really happens between Salieri and Mozart's wife.  It is never quite clear why they hate each other in the original.  Even better, we get more of the old Salieri talking.<p>THE FILM ITSELF:  Peter Schaffer is one of the best, most underrated playwrights of our time.  Equus is one of the great masterpieces of modern theater.  The title credits get it right with "Peter Schaffer's Amadeus".  As the documentary shows however, the play was altered radically on its way from the stage to the screen (and not always for the better).  I can't help but feel, however, the Milos Forman is overrated as a filmmaker.  With One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, he found a movie formula - that of the plucky iconoclast - and he has been remaking that film OVER AND OVER as The People vs. Larry Flint, Man in the Moon...and Amadeus.  Whenever he deviates from that formula, the films flop.<p>The main complaint people have against this film is the acting - specifically Tom Hulce as Mozart.  Perhaps it is because Milos Forman's first language is not English he misses the subtleties of performance.  In the documentary, he pontificates about how thousands of actors were tested, and how important casting is.  But the question remains - why didn't he do better?  He casts mostly American actors and, for some reason, you just can't buy eighteenth-century dialogue coming from contemporary American accents.  The exception to this, of course, is F. Murray Abraham, who won an Oscar for this performance.  He is an accomplished theater actor who knows how to use his voice.  Even though he does not affect an English accent, he knows how to do elevated dialogue so we believe his Salieri.  The best parts of the movie are of the old Salieri reciting Peter Schaffer's wonderful dialogue over the music of Mozart.</p></body></html>

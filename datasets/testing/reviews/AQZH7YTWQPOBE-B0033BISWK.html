<meta name="summary" content="First contact in hell"></head><body><p>Most sci-fi movies about first contact with aliens are optimistic about humanity, portraying the event either as a chance for peoples of different nations to make common cause against alien enemies (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WQWPKA">Independence Day [Blu-ray</a>]) or a moment that inspires us to reach for the stars (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I9Z8G2">Star Trek VIII: First Contact</a>). While fun, most of these movies feel more like fantasy than a probable reality.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a>, by contrast, takes a different approach. This movies is about a first contact from hell, in which alien refugees are corralled into slums by cynical humans. This is certainly a very, very different portrayal of first contact. The film's approach to humanity, the mix of opportunism and sheer indifference, strike me as jarringly realistic. I know it sounds crazy, but at times I though to myself: yeah, this does seem possible. This could be how it happens.<br /><br />Part of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a>'s success comes from the way it was filmed. Much of the movie is filmed as if it were a documentary. Television crews accompany the hapless bureaucrat Wilkus (Sharlto Copley) as he evicts the aliens from their shacks, giving it the feel of a news report more than sci-fi/fantasy movie. The movie also interviews "experts" in alien biology and sociology, which brings audiences up to speed on the situation. At first, I was skeptical about this cinematographical technique because it sounded a bit corny, but it's actually very effective. It really helps blur the distinction between reality and the movie, allowing viewers to become totally absorbed in the story.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that, midway through the film, it seemed to descend a bit more into a typical action flick. It never quite went too far to spoil the movie. In fact, one of the things I really loved about the movie is how the characters responded. Even during the most intense battles, when other movies would have simply focused on the big fireballs, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a> has compelling moments when the various characters must make important choices.<br /><br />I thought everything else in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a> was superb, from the acting to the soundtrack. The special effects were great. I loved the design of the aliens. These aren't simply giant blue people (a la  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1B6">Avatar</a>). The "prawns" as they're called are alien enough that they look creepy and make you sympathize a bit with the government's decision to quarantine them. However, they also are able to convey emotions and demonstrate their intelligence and humane side.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a> is easily one of the most original films I've seen this past decade. It's got the spunk, soul, and plot that films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1B6">Avatar</a> simply don't possess. Highly recommended. I hope there's a sequel.<br /><br />Note: The DVD has some of the best deleted scenes I've ever seen. There is a lot of material not included in the film, including a lecture about the anatomy of the aliens.</p></body></html>

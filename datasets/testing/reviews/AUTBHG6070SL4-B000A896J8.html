He finds that the village priest not only desecrated but looted her body. This costs Balian much of his Christian faith, and costs the priest his life. Balian joins a myterious traveller on a Crusade to the holy land, one step ahead of the law, whether or not that law stands for justice.<br /><br />The rest of the story builds well. Balian enters Jerusalem, and rises in importance there. His dealings with the other Christians in charge of the city corrode his already rusted faith. Although their voices aren't as loud, he speaks as one of the secular rulers of the city, dealing as fairly as he can with Jew, Muslim, and Christian alike.<br /><br />Balian becomes ruler of Jerusalem, through improbable circumstance, and its defender when the Saracens attack. The battle scenes are dramatic. In-fighting is bloody and vicious, and the night attack on the city will horrify anyone who thinks about it. The night sky light with Greek fire isn't that different from the napalm and phosphorus attacks of our own age, in all the worst ways. In the end, the city wall falls to the catapaults, and the attackers flow in like water through a breached levee.<br /><br />Although the city falls, Balian single-handedly saves the people in it. His personal honor is known and respected among the attackers, so they trade him the brick and stone of the city for the lives of its citizens, and for their safe passage out.<br /><br />It's an exciting movie. The battles are vivid, even if parts them were computer enhanced. The people are larger than life, but not exaggerated beyond belief - perhaps that's what cost it at the box office. Ignore the critics. It's well made, with characters you can care about, and better than a lot of other quasi-historical dramas out there.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tepid tale of childhood friends"></head><body><p>Ten-year old Jess, bullied at school and ignored at home, meets new girl Leslie, who's also looked upon as a weirdo and outsider.  The two become friends and use their imagination to turn a secret spot in the woods into a beautiful kingdom.  In "Terabithia," they rule over the strange but good creatures and battle the Dark Lord.  Everything is great, until one day when Jess doesn't come to play.<br /><br />This movie could have, and should have been wonderful, with flights of fancy that made me say, "WOW!" and touching moments that left me teary.  Unfortunately, it missed the mark.  The fantasy land the children created wasn't that big of a deal; we only saw fleeting glimpses of it and never had time to be awed by its wonder and wish it were real.  The two young leads, Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, were competent, but not special.  Neither of them had the charisma to own the screen and make me care about them.  Of course, the big culprit was the script, which tried to include too much, ending up with not enough.  We get Jess' poverty, artistic talent, and loneliness, Leslie's quirkiness and pluck, the bullies at school, his crush on his teacher, and the often-annoying cute younger sister, complete with precious lisp; with all this, there wasn't time to make Terabithia seem real or as fantastic as it should have been.  The scene that should have elicited tears was abrupt and completely lacking in drama and power.  So, it's an OK movie if you're stuck watching it on a plane, but not a flick to buy, unless your kids are fans of the book.  2.5 stars.</p></body></html>

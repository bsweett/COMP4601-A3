<meta name="summary" content="Time for a good movie series to end"></head><body><p>Although hardcore fans of the Resident Evil video game have complained about this movie series from the beginning, I gave the first two (2) Resident Evil movies very high marks for being a good modernized variation on the whole Zombie genre.<br /><br />With this third installment, I must now say it looks like it is time to end the series.<br />This third movie seemed less like Resident Evil and more like a combined tribute or "homage" to ...<br /><br />Road Warrior<br />The Birds<br />Day of the Dead<br />Matrix<br />and The Sixth Day<br />.... all wrapped into one.<br /><br />This film seemed to have a hard time finding it's center and just seemed like a mish-mash of random elements tossed in to give Alice an excuse to overuse her two curved battle swords.<br /><br />I bought the first two Resident Evil movies on DVD for our collection, but we have no plans to order this 3rd film.<br />We would never care to watch it again.<br />It was pretty flat.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nicely flawed thriller"></head><body><p>The Hughes Brothers bring us this surprisingly good, and maybe all too believeable, thriller based on the graphic novel of the same name.  Johnny Depp stars as an opium smoking Scotland Yard detective assigned to bring Jack the Ripper to justice by using his special "talent": smoking opium with some other drugs to have psychic visions, and naturally, it works.  Eventually Depp uncovers a vast conspiracy that even has links to the throne, and all is not what it seems.  Heather Graham stars as a prostitute who Depp falls for, and Ian Holm absolutely steals the entire movie as a washed up surgeon.  The cinematography is superbly shot, and Depp gives a fine performace as usual, but Graham is just not believeable in her role, not acting wise I mean, but she is just too beautiful to be a prostitute from that time period, the other actresses look their roles (no offense to them).  There are some nice DVD extras as well, and the entire package is well rounded, so if your a fan of Depp or are looking for a different type of thriller, there aren't many better choices than From Hell.</p></body></html>

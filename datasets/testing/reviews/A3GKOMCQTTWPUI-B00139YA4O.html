<meta name="summary" content="WOW, the best series since 24"></head><body><p>"Lost" became an instant hit, and the series has since rewarded its faithful audience with engaging plotlines, intriguing and realistic characters, and convoluted twists which spark endless speculation. The show focuses on 14 of the original 48 survivors, with the rest of the group being made up of extras and a few recurring characters. The format of each episode focuses on the past of one of the 14 characters (in a "flashback" form), whilst simultaneously depicting events in the "present" time of the island. But of course, the island is no mere setting. The island is the omnipresent 15th character, delivering surprises and danger for the survivors at every turn. By all means, it appears to be a rather sizeable South Pacific tropical paradise, but as the survivors quickly find out, this island is far from normal. Though it feeds its inhabitants, sometimes heals or aids those in need, and keeps<br /><br />its stranded victims mysteriously well-groomed and ruggedly handsome at all times, it also contains terrifying danger and befuddling mysteries. I'd be willing to bet that most other South Pacific islands don't have polar bears, anachronistic artifacts, or large obscure beasts that sound like robotic dinosaurs roaming the inland forests and feeding on the deepest fears of their victims. But when the hope of rescue vanishes quickly, the survivors must learn how to sustain themselves within this supernatural atmosphere.<br /><br />Social roles and reputations are established among the core fourteen, and several character staples are present, though somehow given a more believable, less-caricatured spin. The pseudo-leader feigning bravery to compensate for his own inner demons, the amicable one with a criminal past, the seemingly uncaring jerk with a tragic history, the kid with strange powers and his stubborn father, the washed-up musician, or the wise intuitive elder who somehow understands the behavior of the island and goes with the flow of its will. Just a few examples, although Abrams and his creative team are, by and large, successful in making these character templates not seem derivative. Their personable behavior only makes you more curious to witness their outcome on this lost, and increasingly otherworldly, island.<br /><br />Originally, the concept for this series was formed and hammered out in just a scant few months before its premiere. Its production was incredibly fast; for example, only 3 weeks were allowed to cast nearly 2 dozen people for primary, long term, and recurring roles. By the time the series premiered, the season had only a slim order of 13 episodes for its first season. After the first four episodes garnered enormously high ratings, however, approval was given out to produce another 9 episodes, making 22 total. Filmed during the airing of the other 13, "Lost" was given a very padded out schedule in order to make up for the wait time of the latter 9; the show even went on hiatus for nearly a month in December of 2004. Despite its slightly clumsy beginnings, however, the show continued to pull in high ratings from enraptured audiences and received much critical acclaim for its high-quality storytelling, culminating with both Golden Globe and Emmy awards for Best Drama Series, in addition to several other accolades, nominations, and wins.<br /><br />Constantly challenging, always engaging, "Lost" is an addictive puzzle of a series, and richly rewards the astute adult audience it's aimed at. Though its high ratings and continual popularity could possibly subject it to overexposure, scheduling abuse, or creative burnout on the part of the writers (wherein they ask more questions than they can satisfactorily answer), the potential for this series is still incredible, and I for one am hoping for many more labyrinthine years to come!</p></body></html>

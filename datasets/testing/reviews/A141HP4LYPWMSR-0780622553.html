<meta name="summary" content=""It Is Mr. Murdoch, Isn't It?" ~ Challenging The Collective Reality"></head><body><p>What if everything you knew and thought about yourself was false? Even further unnerving, what if a highly evolved alien race from another world lurked in the unseen shadows cleverly manipulating our daily activities to suit their own collective whims? A race so advanced that they can literally alter our reality with their minds through a process called "tuning."<br /><br />One man, Mr. Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakens from a bad dream, or maybe better put awakens into a bad dream and has seen `things' he doesn't understand. If he survives what lies ahead he just might see the world as it truly is.<br /><br />`Dark City' released in '98 was truly the prototype for the reality bending `Matrix Trilogy' that was to follow one year later. As the film title indicates, this is a very dark film dealing with a subject matter that generally would appeal only to a small and specific viewing audience. It is also a movie that elicits a strong emotional response from the audience at both ends of the spectrum. Whether you like it or not its images and storyline will remain with you for a day or two. Leave a light on if you must.</p></body></html>

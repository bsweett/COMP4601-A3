I liked it even more than Pitch Black surprisingly. Riddick is Vin Diesel's best character period. He's super cool and  deadly and Diesel plays him extremely well. The villains are weak with this silly name. They look like a rip-off of something from Stargate.<br /><br />  I don't know why Judi Denches performance gets knocked though. She's a lot better than a lot of the other supporting actors. Colm Feore (Storm of the Century) as the head villain is a lot worse. Thandie Newton (Mission Impossible 2), is bad too as this sneaky 2 faced women who is conspiring against him. Alexa Davalos isn't bad though as the Jack character from the first one all grown-up. Her character wanted to be like Riddick in Pitch Black and now her fighting skills a lot like his and she's pretty deadly herself. Anyway this movie is a lot of fun and always entertaining due to Diesel's performance. Script wise though, the Riddick video game even has a better story.</p></body></html>

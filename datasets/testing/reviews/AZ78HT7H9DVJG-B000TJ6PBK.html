To me, *1408* is just a movie version of *Tales from the Crypt* or *Amazing Stories*, something like that.<br /><br />Cusack plays Enslin, a doubtful author who visits and publishes books on noted places of paranormal phenomena.  One day, Enslin gets an anonymous postcard about the famed room, 1408, of the Dolphin Hotel in NYC.  Unable to resist the temptation to debunk the hype, Enslin registers for the room.<br /><br />Upon arrival, the hotel manager (Jackson) tries to dissuade Enslin from staying in that room.  Enslin is told of the grisly murders and strange occurrences/histories of room 1408.  However, nothing will prevent Enslin from staying in the room.<br /><br />Upon entrance of 1408, Enslin is in a twilight zone.  Things are what they seemed to be.  Gradually, Enslin starts to believe that paranormal activities are real.  The question is...can Enslin come out of the room alive?<br /><br />I thought *1408* was ok.  It wasn't scary or anything like that.  It was more of illusions or perceptions from Enslin, which could have been scary for him.  However, there was nothing scary for the audience.  There's a little too much talk.  More action, please!</p></body></html>

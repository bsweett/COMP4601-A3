<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good action adventure film - but no real WOW factor."></head><body><p>This film cost $130 million to make, but only earned $120 million in worldwide gross plus $10 million for TV rights.  You might think that means it broke even, but in movie math that means it only got half of its money back.  It was released almost two years after it was completed, so the studio knew it had problems.  What are the problems?<br /><br />Well, it isn't a bad movie in the sense that while you are watching it you want to throw something at the screen.  Yes, it has a preposterous underlying idea - that a civil war ironclad from the confederate states, laden with CSA gold, somehow traveled across the ocean and maybe ended up trapped in the Sahara desert.  But so what?  A lot of movies have more preposterous ideas than that and make hundreds of millions of dollars.<br /><br />All the actors do a good job and play the movie straight.  There is some action, danger, fighting, and even some not too gory dying.  You would expect that with Penelope Cruz there would be some real sensuality, but not in this movie.  She is Dr. Eva Rojas from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) risking life and limb to track down the source of a plague before it becomes an epidemic, so she can worry about love later.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) are childhood buddies who have gone through school, the Navy Seals, and life afterwards together.  They work for "The Admiral" Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy) under whom they served in the Navy.  In their current job they bring up sunken historical artifacts for various countries around the world.  This also gives Dirk occasional time to indulge his speculations about what happened to the Civil War Ironclad with all that gold that no one else believes exists.<br /><br />Fate brings Dirk and Eva together and drives them both north of Niger into Mali for different purposes.  They both end up finding something very different than they expected, all the while Giordino provides the sidekick relief (and is often the most fun and energetic character on the screen).  In the end, well ... you have to watch it to find out.<br /><br />I think the problem is simply one of chemistry and lift.  Dirk and Eva are the love story, but Dirk shows more interest in the gold than in Eva, although he knows which is more important and does his duty.  He does fall for her, but always seems more comfortable with Giordino.  It is a movie worth seeing once, but to be a big blockbuster you need a large portion of the audience to say, "Wow!" and come back several times.<br /><br />So, rent it, enjoy it as a good family adventure action film.  It is fun, just don't expect to be knocked off your feet.</p></body></html>

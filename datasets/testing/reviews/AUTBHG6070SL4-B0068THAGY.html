<meta name="summary" content="Just didn't do it for me"></head><body><p>"Super 8" has lots of great parts to it: nerdy kids pursuing their passion, budding young love, government conspiracies, and a pretty cool monster, left just shadowy enough to engage the viewer's imagination. Given the potential of these ingredients, I'm not sure why it didn't do more for me.<br /><br />Maybe part of it was the navel-gazing aspect of a movie made about tweenage movie-makers, as if someone was trying to write an autobiography the way it should have been. Maybe it was the triteness of anthropophagy - as if earthly proteins would do anything for a visitor from elsewhere. Maybe ... well it doesn't matter. I'm not asking for my money back, but I have no reason to see it again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters</p></body></html>

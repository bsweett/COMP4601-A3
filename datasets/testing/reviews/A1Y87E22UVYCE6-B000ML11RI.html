<meta name="summary" content="Great Pulp Movie!"></head><body><p>As a teenager I was very fond of comics, later my passion declined but I still pick up some classics as Harold Foster's "Prince Valiant", Hugo Pratt's "Corto Maltes" or the Argentinean Hector Oesterheld "El Eternauta" and enjoy them. So I'm not immune to this kind of products.<br /><br />One thing must be pointed out straightly: "Sin City" it is a violent and dreadful film only apt to be seen by adult audiences.  I suspend ethical judgment and take it as it is: a dark fantasy full of sadomasochist imagery, with all the id monsters running free.<br /><br />I was truly amazed by this movie: it is a Pulp Comic Book thrown UNCHANGED to the screen. There are perfect details: the glasses of the psycho Kevin always shining, the white blood, the silhouettes all black or white, the nude & gorgeous girls, the unbelievable gore, the amazing prowess of Marv & Hartigan, the one-dimensional ethical code of some characters and the list is goes on and on.<br /><br />IMO this is not an adaptation of a comic it IS the comic expressed with another language!<br /><br />The story is a transcription of three Frank Miller's graphic books: "The Hard Goodbye", "The Big Fat Kill" and "The Yellow Bastard" that are loosely related having The City as a common graphic and moody background.<br /><br />The "heroes" are as brutal, bloodthirsty and revengeful as the "bad guys" with the possible exception of Hartigan (nearer to be a Dirty Harry). Nevertheless deep inside them there is a spark of goodness and nobility that make some distinction possible.<br /><br />The dames are a special condiment: almost all of them (un)dressed in sexy exotic lingerie; showing different styles are not less ruthless and dangerous than men.<br /><br />The whole cast seems to enjoy their own performances giving a "plus" hardly seen lately. It is most notably in Mickey Rourke impersonation of Marv. Bruce Willis, Benicio del Toro and Clive Owen are top. Rutger Hauer gives almost a cameo as the Cardinal. Elijah Wood as the cannibalistic psycho is creepy beyond believe.<br /><br />Jessica Alba is very sensual as the teen-striper; Devon Aoki is a wordless icon with her shining sword, Jaime King is Marv's goddess duplicated and a long list continues.<br /><br />I give this product big thumb up! Remember: only for adult audience.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

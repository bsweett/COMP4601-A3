<meta name="summary" content="A film that puts most every other 2004 film to shame."></head><body><p>I spent the hundred or so minutes of this film's duration in a hypnotized but stressed-out state. Stress because I felt as if I was standing right there next to Maria Alvarez, the titular character.<br /><br />This remarkable film does so many things well, it's hard to catalog them...but I'll try anyways.<br /><br />First, the depiction of life in Colombia, and how simple/necessary it is to become involved in the drug trade, is effortlessly but exquisitely told. Our heroine has no other options...it's obvious.<br /><br />Second, the details on, shall we say, "mule" training, were enough to make my wife and I both nearly gag in empathy.<br /><br />Third, the suspense that builds during the initial travel to the U.S. is nerve-rattling.<br /><br />Fourth, the entry into NY and the harrowing motel scenes, again, are brilliantly but plainly told. I didn't want to blink.<br /><br />That's all fine and dandy, but the single unifying element that raises this film into the category of something "really special" is the performance of Catalina Sandino Moreno.  Miss Moreno presents us with a fully formed, incredibly detailed and nuanced character; there's not a false note in her entire performance. She had me from the moment she appeared until the final fade-out.<br /><br />Now having seen this movie, there is no question why she was nominated for Best Actress. It's that good.<br /><br />In an age where sequels are made from the most embarrassing tripe, here is one of those rare films where I would do anything to see what happens after the credits roll.<br /><br />I need to know that she's OK.<br /><br />I'm from Colombia. I know Colombia. This film gets it right.<br /><br />Bravo, Joshua Marston and bravo Miss Moreno. You've made a simple, eloquent film that puts most everything else from 2004 to shame.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sad sad sad sad"></head><body><p>The viewer has to prepare himself before watching "The hours". This is not a common movie. It's a deep, sad, and very depressive movie.<p>There are three timelines in "The hours", and director Daldry chose to show them simultaneously; all stories are about one day in the lives of three women. I'll list the three timelines:<p>1) England, 1923 - Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway; she receives the visit of her sister; she tries to set her life straight, as she's not living the life she wanted, because of medical and psychological problems. <p>2) California, 1950 - Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife with a little son; this is the day of her husband's (john C. Reilly) birthday; she's reading Mrs. Dalloway; she has doubts about everything, from her sexuality to her will to go on living.<p>3) New York, 2001 - Clarissa Vaughn's (Meryl Streep) day is about organizing a party to her friend and ex-one time-lover, the poet and writer Richard (Ed Harris), who is receiving an important prize of lifetime achievment in poetry.<p>The three stories are connected; the most obvious connection is that Clarissa Vaughn is the modern Mrs. Dalloway. There are recurrent themes in the three stories, all related to Mrs. Dalloway and Virginia Woolf's life: sexual doubts, depressive thoughts, death wishes. Stephen Daldry made a movie more complex than he wanted, without knowing he did it. Uncounsciously, "The hours" is deeper and denser than its director wanted it to be. You have to get a degree in psychology to fully understand all the relationship between the women characters. <p>Although "The hours" is starred by women, a movie about women, with three of today's top actresses, their constant presence and the fact that the three of them are so sad, depressive and unresolved characters, makes the male actors' (Stephen Dillane, John C. Reilly and Ed Harris) acting excellent. The best one in my opinion is Stephen Dillane's Leonard Woolf. <p>Two things I didn't like:<p>A) Meryl Streep lost herself here; her acting seemed a little bit forced and self-conscious, trying to make Clarissa a different character from other characters she's played in other movies: she couldn't do it. I've seen this same Clarissa in other Meryl Streep movies (Meryl Streep is much better in "Adaptation").<p>B) Nicole Kidman, although in good acting shape, played a character (Virginia Woolf) so sad and depressive that I couldn't care one bit what happened to her. I think the writers exagerated Virginia's depression to make the audience understand better what happened to her, but this trick completely backfired. No one can stand Virgina Woolf in the movie. And the scene with the dead bird is the oldest metaphore ever. <p>Without any doubt, the real star of the movie is Julianne Moore. As the sad and unloving Laura, she is the most complex, convincing and believable character of "The hours". <p>There are other aspects of this movie to be discussed, but this review is already too long. <p>So, to wrap it up,<p>Grade 8.7/10</p></body></html>

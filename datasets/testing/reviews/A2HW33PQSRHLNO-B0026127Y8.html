At the beginning we see a lonely man who, to all outward appearances, seems very gentle and attempting to make up for lost time with his gorgeous daughter, Kim.  Having spent his life dealing with dangerous people and preventing "bad things" (where was Brian Mills on before 9/11? Couldn't a guy like this grab Osama Bin Laden in five seconds?)<br /><br />Anyway, against his advice, his daughter goes to Paris with a few of her friends.  Brian is concerned because he is aware that there are people who are into selling young girls into a slave trade for high class criminals.  And, of course, his daughter gets kidnapped.<br /><br />Neeson does a superb job of turning within the course of about fifteen seconds from a concerned father into a walking, barking, unstoppable killing machine.  The reason the film is believable is because of Neeson's blank facial expression, his ability to switch off his emotions in a deadly second, and his ruthlessness.  Whoever trained the actor in whatever martial art/self defense skills did a good job.  And Mills is no angel.  There are scenes in which he way too far.  There is nothing sentimental about it.  He wants his daughter and nothing going to stop him unless it's a very well placed bullet.<br /><br />Though some of this might strike the viewer as a bit far fetched, it is Liam Neeson's performance that makes it worth watching.  A riveting, chilling movie.</p></body></html>

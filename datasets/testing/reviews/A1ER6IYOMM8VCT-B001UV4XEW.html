<meta name="summary" content="LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY! NICE BLU RAY!"></head><body><p>I have wanted to see this film ever since I first saw the trailer many months ago. The film lives up to and beyond my expectations as it is not only funny, but avoids the obvious pitfalls of these buddy comedies with a fresh approach. The story of "the day after" is one that is easily identified with(well at least most guys will) and by having us come along for the ride to find out what the H E L L happened the night before, keeps the viewer completely focused as if we were part of that night. Even though the basic story has been done a million times, I can not remember when it has been done better. I watched the unrated version first and I will compare the two versions soon. The Blu Ray looks great and has a nice assortment of extras, including 100 pictures from the night before that are almost as funny as the film(just make sure you watch the film first). Other extras include a gag reel, making of, map of the night before and lots more. One of the most enjoyable comedies I've seen in the past few years.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Script Needs Work"></head><body><p>The Interpreter is an extremely packaged political thriller that contains only a little punch.  Unfortunately the good acting can't overcome the weak script. I felt like the story was still a 2-3 drafts short of being ready for the screen. The biggest problem was that there are plot holes you could drive a truck through. I also felt the movie dragged through most of the middle as they tried to develop the strained relationship between the principle characters.  If you are a plot-driven movie fan, as I am, the movie is likely to be a disappointment.<br /><br />Even though "The Interpreter" was enjoyable the ending was definitely a disappointment. It wasn't that it was necessarily wrong, just that you knew what was coming.</p></body></html>

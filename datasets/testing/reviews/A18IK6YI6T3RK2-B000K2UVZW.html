<meta name="summary" content="LORD WHAT A MESS"></head><body><p>Actually this movie has some good points..like Hillary Swank..although i honestly, she needs a new agent if this is the best he can do for her.  As for Josh Hartlet, he ought to kiss the ground everyday for his career, because he is bar none the WORST actor in Hollywood, i think he has sold his soul to the devil, which is all fine and good, but i didnt,  so why do i have to endure the torture of watching him..he and Scarlet Johansen have NO chemistry and frankly she is as bad as him in this..what is with all the stareing, what the f is she looking at?...i guess she's just so gobsmacked that she's in this film, she's gone into shock.  I give this film two stars instead of none because of the great Fiona Shaw, she is worth watching this for: she is hilarious.  Frankly, this film in better hands could have been watchable, but as it is, id say, dont walk away from this movie if you see it for rent...RUNNNN Forest, RUNNNNNNNNNNNN.</p></body></html>

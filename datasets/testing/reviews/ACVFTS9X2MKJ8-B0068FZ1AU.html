<meta name="summary" content="Fabulous for some people, disappointing to others (like me, for instance)"></head><body><p>This was a great fun inspirational film.  Innocent and charming (well, with some small sexual innuendos).  But, here's how I see that some people will be divided on its overall appeal:<br /><br />For people who've heard of ABBA and may know a couple of their songs, this film will definitely make you wanna run out and buy some ABBA CD's.  For those of us (like me) who already have all of ABBA's CD's and have cherished ABBA all their life, these actors singing ABBA songs is rather dull and much less energetically expressive than the ever-vivacious vocal outbursts of Annafrid and Agnetha (the original girls of ABBA).<br /><br />The original songs from ABBA have incredibly talented harmonizing and enthusiasm.  None of these actors can hit the notes like Agnetha and Annafrid (also known as Frida) did in their day.  And especially Pierce Brosnan. This was an embarrassing transition from being a former James Bond.<br /><br />However, I'm glad to see a movie made as a musical to many of ABBA's fabulous songs.  Pick up ABBA's greatest hits on CD, or just go ahead and get all eight of their original albums.  You will be in for a treat!<br /><br />Let me give you one good example of the girls of ABBA belting their voices out so strong.  Go to YouTube and listen to ABBA's version of "Chiquitita", and concentrate of the voices and the fabulous background orchestration.  It is one of the greatest songs they've done which is a great example of their enormous talent.  ABBA will never be topped.</p></body></html>

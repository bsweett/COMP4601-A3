So if you can accept the fact of I guess a 'dark angel' with black wings telling Constantine that unless he finds accpetance from God for the good things he's doing ... well then he's 'f..cked'  I really thought was over the top ....<br /><br />For the viewers that are looking for Matrix like overdoses then this is probably a 5 star special .... certainly modern cinematography has done marvels to exorcism scenes ... but anyone looking for a storyline that is coherent as in 'The Exorcist' ... well forget it ....<br /><br />The storyline will make sense to only the most avid of fans .....</p></body></html>

Selene, the vampire death-dealer, and Michael, the vampire-lycan hybrid, are on the run after killing Victor, the head of the vampires who betrayed them.  The plot of Evolution involves the "fathers" of vampires and lycans, twin brothers from the 13th century, one of whom was the first vampire, while the other was the first Lycan.  Markus, the first vampire gets awakened and sets off on a quest to free his brother, William, who has been secretly imprisoned for eight centuries.  Along the way, there is, of course, many action sequences, a lot of gore, and the necessary sex scene.<br /><br />While Underworld: Evolution is a pretty by-the-book vampire movie, it makes itself better by inventing an interesting storyline for the audience to follow.  I mean, at this point in the history of cinema, you are a genius if you can make an "original" vampire movie.  And Underworld is about as close as I've seen in my life to a truly original vampire storyline.  The effects are fairly impressive.  Some moments they look cheesy, while at other moments they are thoroughly impressive on every level: realism and how cool they look.  The movie looks very cool, as did the first one.  Len Wiseman, the director, creates a very dark, brooding atmosphere (of course, everything takes place at night), and the sets that are used are very cool.<br /><br />The acting is solid.  Kate Beckinsale is an OK actress, but she is the main character in this movie for one reason: so we can see her in a tight, leather jumpsuit the whole time, and see her get naked once.  I think that Scott Speedman is a very good actor.  Unfortunately, he hasn't exactly been choosing the best movies to further his career (XXX: State of the Union, anyone?).<br /><br />Underworld: Evolution is a movie worth seeing.  It is faster-paced than the first one, and the action is even a little better.  Don't expect too much, though.  This movie knows what it is, and it doesn't try to do anything more with itself than what is necessary.</p></body></html>

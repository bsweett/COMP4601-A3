<meta name="summary" content="So much better than I expected!"></head><body><p>Chalk up another action thriller success for Bruce Willis. "Hostage" takes an age-old, stale concept...the hostage thriller...and tweaks it enough to make the most jaded viewer sit up and take notice 45 minutes into the film.<br /><br />First of all, the director, Florent Siri, flaunts his creative vision at every turn, telling the story simply, yet inserting sly edits or artful compositions that you only notice when you get a chance to breathe.<br /><br />The performances were all fine (except Willis' estranged wife...she struck me as a little amateurish) with Ben Foster doing a particularly menacing turn. In fact, it bordered on the "disturbing"...seeing evil right there on the surface. He did it well. Really well.<br /><br />The screenplay has enough "randomness" to keep your attention, and honestly it has no more plot contrivances than any other movie of this genre. The good thing is that you are too involved to care, which shows you the movie is doing it's job.<br /><br />Even the opening credits were kinda neat.<br /><br />One little caveat, which will make sense to those who have seen the film. Maybe I missed it, but the identity of an important bad guy is never revealed. It feels like it that should be important, and there are lines that suggest that we are leading up to a big "a-HA!" moment. Oh well.<br /><br />If you need a Friday night, put-the-popcorn-on and put-the-feet-up entertainment, you will likely be very happy you put "Hostage" in your DVD player.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting concept...and that's about all"></head><body><p>First of all, I think the idea of picking up women at weddings and funerals quite clever.  Anyone whoever been to a wedding knows all the single women are in full fairy tale mode and are ripe for the picking.  It's probably the only place a janitor could get some serious play.  So the first part of the film I found very funny.  But then the rest of the story with Owen's character falling in love and the girl's jerk of a fiance all too cliche and predictable.  I was actually bored--except when the brother nearly rapes Vaughn's character.  That's an accomplishement to make a near rape funny...but the rest ho hum.  Is it over yet?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An exemplary remake"></head><body><p>"The Manchurian Candidate" is a sleek, stylish thriller about power, politics and paranoia. It is a remake of a truly classic 1962 thriller, which was directed by John Frankenheimer and starred Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, and Laurence Harvey.  While the new version is both scary and entertaining, the original is powerful enough to blow the viewer away.<br /><br />The film starts in Kuwait in 1991 just before The Gulf War officially started. A US army patrol, led by Capt. Ben Marco [Denzel Washington] is attacked. Allegedly due to the heroism of Sgt. Raymond Shaw [Liev Schreiber], who receives the Medal of Honor, all but two members of the patrol are saved. The mysterious thing is that after the attack, three days elapse before another unit finally locates the `lost' patrol.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2004. Sgt. Shaw, son of powerful US Senator Eleanor Shaw [Meryl Streep] is now a US Senator. Eleanor, the mother of all pushy mothers, sees Raymond as a candidate for Vice-President. Aided by her allies at Manchurian Corp., a huge multi-national company to which she has sold her soul, she can achieve this. Enter Capt. Marco, who has spent the last several years trying to figure out what happened in those `lost' days. Raymond is clueless. Eleanor has all the clues and more. Can Marco thwart a diabolic plot to overthrow our government?<br /><br />The new version has an advantage over the original. It is far more likely that our nation will be taken over by giant corporations rather than by Communists, as the original foresaw.<br /><br />The original triumphs because it is both a monument to great filmmaking and a product if its time. As horrific as 9/11 was, it can not compare to the fear of 1962, which was nuclear holocaust - the end of civilization as we know it. People today can not fathom what paranoia was back then.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DAVID CRONENBERG, OPUS 17"></head><body><p>**** 2007. Directed by David Cronenberg. One nomination for the Oscars (Viggo Mortensen) and three nominations for the Golden Globes. A nurse discovers the world of the Russian mob in London when she starts to read the diary of a dead 14 years old prostitute. The description of the peculiar world of the Russian mobsters and the characters played by Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassel should lead you to see this very violent film of the Canadian master. Recommended.</p></body></html>

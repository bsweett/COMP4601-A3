<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely Incredible"></head><body><p>This movie can be summed up in four words: BEST ANIMATED MOVIE EVER!!!  This is the first animated film (that wasn't a sequel) to actually get me hyped in years, and fortunately, I was not only not let down, I was amazed and happy with the quality of the animation, the story, and the dialogue.<br /><br />The Incredibles takes place in a world where superheroes are common.  Its kind of like X-Men, where some people are born with special powers, and while some use them for good, others use them for evil.  A few of these supers (as they are called) include Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), who is endowed with superstrength, his girlfriend/wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), who can stretch her body and create a variety of shapes, and their friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), who can freeze any water in the area, including moisture in the air.  For a while, things are great for them until a bunch of lawsuits against superheroes begin to be filed by people who either did not want to be saved or who were injured while being saved.  In order to help the supers out, the government created a Superhero Relocation Program.  Lucious Best, Bob Parr, and Helen Parr (the true identities of the three aforementioned heroes) were forced to move to suburbia and live out their lives like normal citizens.<br /><br />15 years later, the Parrs have a daughter, Violet (Sarah Vowell), who can turn invisible and create energy barriers, and two sons.  One of them is Dash (Spencer Fox), who can travel at super speeds, and the other one is baby Jack Jack, who doesn't have any powers (they think).  The Parr family suffers from most of the traditional family problems; Dash is a bit of a troublemaker at school, while Violet is a maladjust who often feels invisible (both physically and mentally).  Bob is stuck in a crappy insurance job, and he constantly incurs the wrath of his boss (voiced by Wallace Shawn) for helping customers too much.  Bob and Helen's marriage is on the rocks because Bob wants to relive his glory days as Mr. Incredible despite the risk of lawsuits, while Helen knows that the past must be put behind them.  Things only get worse when a mysterious fellow super named Mirage (Elizabeth Pena) offers a job to Bob that requires him to become Mr. Incredible again.  Originally, the biggest problem is that Helen thinks that Bob is having an affair, but things get much worse when Mr. Incredible realizes that Mirage tricked him; he was brought out of retirement by Syndrome (Jason Lee), a man that idolized Mr. Incredible as a youth.  The young Syndrome (then calling himself Incredi-boy) always tried to tag along with Mr. Incredible, but due to a lack of powers, Mr. Incredible always dismissed him.  However, Syndrome is a mechanical genius, and he built numerous weapons to sell and use against supers.  The rest of the Parr family is forced to suit up to rescue the missing patriarch.<br /><br />This movie is incredibly funny.  There is no shortage of jokes, whether they are sight gags or spoken.  There were many points were the dialogue was drowned out by all the laughing going on (but I didn't see it in a theater; I saw it in a classroom/auditorium at an advance screening at my university).  A plus for older people is that many of the jokes exist on two levels, however, there were a few that I'm surprised made it into a kids movie, but I'm glad they were included as they were extremely funny (like the line about taking shots).  Also, the character of Edna Mode (the writer/director Brad Bird) just stole the show despite only being in the film for about 10-15 minutes.  Edna is a fashion designer who did a lot of work for supers back in the day, and her mansion and mannerisms are priceless.<br /><br />the visuals of this film are stunning.  I can remember one scene above the ocean, and the water was the most realistic that I've ever seen.<br /><br />This is definitely the darkest/most grown up Pixar film yet (the first to earn a PG instead of a G rating).  One of the first shots (after the hilarious interview opening) involves someone loading a sub-machine gun.  The film deals with affairs, teenage angst (Violet), jealousy, and (in)equality.<br /><br />This is definitely a must-see for, well just about anyone!  If you liked the previous Pixar films (and who hasn't) I guarantee you will like this.  Even if you haven't seen/liked the previous films, you should definitely give this one a try.</p></body></html>

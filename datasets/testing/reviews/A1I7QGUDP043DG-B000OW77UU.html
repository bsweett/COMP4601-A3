<meta name="summary" content="Story from the heart"></head><body><p>This story from the heart shows the triumph of the human spirit. It also added to my distaste for the I.R.S.  This story brings inspiration to anyone who has struggled, or is struggling now, to make a living in a dog eat dog world. A father tries to follow his dream while also caring for his five year old son. They endure events that would make many people give up. I was so happy this story ended on a positive note, for there are so many true stories like this one that do not end happily.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

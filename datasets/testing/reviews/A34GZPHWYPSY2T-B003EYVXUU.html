It is based on the Swedish novel and film "L?t den r&auml;tte komma in", by John Ajvide Lindqvist ("Let the Right One In", 2008, dir. Tomas Alfredson: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAC">Let The Right One In</a>, see my review.)<br /><br />Do not confuse it with the little-known LET ME IN of 2000 - about which I can discover nothing. This, set in Los Alamos, New Mexico in 1983, this story is about poor young Owen (a spectacular Kodi Smit-McPhee). Owen is nearly 13, he's bullied severely and his mother is a religious drunk. The poor boy is turning scary as a result, a bit like seeing Hitler in the making, and it is revolting to see him practicing ... well, I'll leave that for you to discover.<br /><br />Into his life comes 12-year-old vampire Abbey (the equally talented Chloe Grace Moritz), a girl who is at once charming, somewhat naive or dull, yet she writes with something like Mark Twain's handwriting and expressions. She cannot answer Owen when he pointedly asks her if she is a vampire, and there are other things even a regular 12-year-old girl ought to know. Perhaps it's all the hiding in the dark all her undead afterlife. It seems she is nearly 150 or something to that effect. As I understand it, the original character is meant to be 200 years old.<br /><br />LET ME IN has a powerful supporting cast: Elias Koteas as the detective investigating murders, Richard Jenkins as Abbey's boyfriend (c'mon, she's a vampire, they met when he was a kid and he loves her). The boyfriend is committing the murders to get Abbey her blood. Aside from the bone-crunching savagery of Abbey when hungry, there is too much Hammerblood and gore for my taste. That's right, I said Hammerblood!<br /><br />But then, this is a Hammer Films production (via Overture Films for Starz). Odd that I recall my first Hammer film, DRACULA (1958) which catapulted Christopher Lee to international fame. Other Hammer films are the backbone of horror in today's world. What angers me about this film - and the reason I starred it so low - is because I'm tired of all this kidsploitation. These children are too young to be handling roles of such weight and horror.<br /><br />Recently I read an interview with Werner Herzog in "Archeology Review" magazine. He mentioned his old complaint, that we do not have symbols or images worthy of our level of intelligence. He not only means cinema: his grandfather was a prominent though not too well known archeologist. Herzog says that film and advertizing, for example, simply dried up long ago. We are presented no challenges, no context, no feeling and no imagination. The errors in this film came to mind when I read the Herzog interview - it was not a chance occurrence.<br /><br />Screenplay writer/director Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD, THE PALLBEARER) does himself some credit here, neither reveling in nor shrinking from the challenges he places on his young actors' thin shoulders. He captures a silent atmosphere which I like to call "atmosfear" - but the Swedes are better at this in general. (They are also wizards at inserting a prominent cop character in every film they produce, which is the one thing lacking in the original film, ironically enough.)<br /><br />LET ME IN compensates with its eye-popping, slick special effects, which really impressed me. There is an auto accident filmed from inside the car, and how they accomplished this horrific and realistic crash effect is beyond me.<br /><br />In his review, Roger Ebert expressed some confusion about some things, namely why there was snow in New Mexico (it does snow heavily there, Roger) and he stated that this film is a scene-for-scene remake of the Swedish original. I have to DISAGREE, as I disagree with the director's Swedish angle. However, it is almost a scene-for-scene remake. We always ruin Swedish masterpieces by remaking them. We need to stop the remakes - but this made me itchy to see the original. I have now seen it and LOVED it.<br /><br />The half-right, half-wrong era is amusing. The makers clearly did not live through or pay attention to the early 1980s. While some details are spot on, others are pathetic. Why set the film in the early 1980s? - my guess is to make forensics and detection a lot harder. Vampires are like to get dealt with rapidly in the 21st century, I guess.<br /><br />So, is this film about the true nature of evil, the nature of being undead and not really loving it, pure voyeurism as Hitchcock always contended was the goal of film, or is it simply Hammer Films trying to hammer a new stamp on cinematic history? If any of these is true, Hammer had better start doing a lot better than this. I deduct one star.<br /><br />The amazing soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is one of the best I have ever heard and melds Foley art with music in an eerie aural confection. There are a few good 1980s songs here, but I wonder at the dates. If there were a way I could get the Giacchino soundtrack without the 1980s radio chatter, I'd get it for its creepy beauty alone.<br /><br />Now that I have enjoyed the original film, may I recommend you get that, and forget this unless you're hardcore about inadequate, rushed remakes. Also I have to ask: why do we keep remaking these great Swedish films within a year or two? Why remake them at all?</p></body></html>

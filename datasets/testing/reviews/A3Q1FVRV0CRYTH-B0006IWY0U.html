I was expecting something much different...the previews made it appear to be not stop battles and what not, so after the first viewing I was a bit dissapointed.  Yes, Crowe is astonishing as usual and he has every bit of what it takes to COMMAND a role, and that he does here.  It wasn't until seeing it for the second time that I started to appreciate it more, you know, for what it was.  What it is is a great naval movie, not more or less about the battles and the death but about the life people led living on the ships, never seeing home.  The small sub plots which at first I felt took away from what I was waiting for actually served their purpose after watching it again.  The film is beautifully shot, and the authenticity of the set and sounds make you feel as though you are bellow deck with the crew.  In closing I feel that this is a great addition to any DVD collection, and although it may not be what you wanted, if you look at it for what it is you will be not only impressed but quite satisfied.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More then just another re-telling of the quasi-factual Amityville Horror"></head><body><p>Just the name of this film constitutes a long sigh - 'How many times are they going to make this hokey story into yet another film?' And yet the current team of director Andrew Douglas, screenwriter Scott Kosar (based on Jay Anson's novel) and a cast of fresh faces to the genre carry off this much told tale with vigor and a good dollop of tension.<br /><br />For starters the film opens with the re-enactment of the 'actual crime'.  Apparently in 1974 Ronald DeFeo (here Brendan Donaldson) murdered his parents and siblings in a terrific old house in Amityville, NY. One year later the Lutz family discovers their dream house and buys it outright, opening their next 28 days to visions of ghosts, terror, demons, hallucinations and pathological changes among themselves until they finally flee the haunted house.<br /><br />From the start we know that contractor George Lutz - Ryan Reynolds - (the new husband of Kathy) - Melissa George - has problems establishing himself as the 'stepfather' to reluctant children Billy (Jesse James), Michael (Jimmy Bennett) and Chelsea (Chlo? Grace Moretz).  Once the family is ensconced in the house Chelsea begins to play with the ghost of Jodie DeFeo (Isabel Conner) and George's personality changes as a result of the  house's curse.  It all comes down to terror in the requisite thunder, lightning and rain of all horror films until the family hits crisis state and leaves the house behind.<br /><br />The ghost effects are well done and the cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister and the musical score by  Steve Jablonsky  create a dark, ominous atmosphere.  But the real reason to watch this little thriller is the work of Ryan Reynolds as George, released from his usual silly potty mouth roles in teenie films  to show that he indeed can act, and keep his own brand of edgy humor intact - and that is no slight feat. Fortunately he is given the opportunity to display his extraordinarily hunky physique throughout the film, reason enough to see the movie!  Melissa George is likewise excellent as the tortured mother and is a perfect foil for Reynolds.  Not a great film, but certainly one that exceeds expectations set by previous forays into this overused story.  Grady Harp, January 07</p></body></html>

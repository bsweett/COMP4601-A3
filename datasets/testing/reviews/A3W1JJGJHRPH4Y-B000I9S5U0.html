Crowe does an amazing job of portraying the too-good-to-be-true boxer without becoming maudlin. Crowe disappears into the role. He exhibits a quiet dignity throughout the movie. Rene Z. as his wife and Giamatti as his manager are great as well. The movie also focuses on the minor characters and the milieu of the depression era. The movie brings out the despair of the country and how an over-the-hill boxer sparked hope in so many people. One of the best scenes is when the wife goes to the local parish to pray for her husband and finds the church already full of people praying for him. It sounds trite, but it works. I don't know how Ron Howard balanced the emotions so well. I took off a star because it is a story told so many times. My wife did not care for it. She dislikes boxing.</p></body></html>

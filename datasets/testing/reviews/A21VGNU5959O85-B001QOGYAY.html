<meta name="summary" content="The Lovely Bones."></head><body><p>The Lovely Bones, is a book written by Alice Sebold back in 2002. A book which caused much controversy over its subject matter of rape,and murder and its aftermath on a family and community. Its also a book that is much loved by its fans and I have to say that when I read it one of the first things that popped into my head when I finished it was "This will be a hard book to turn into a movie" and I was right. Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings fame, BUT who also did <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065KFV">Heavenly Creatures</a> a film which I absolutely love. I thought that because of the subject matter of Heavenly Creatures, young girls, murder, deep emotional observations and characters...that he would be able to tackle The Lovely Bones on the same level and skill. I was wrong.<br /><br />The movie sets looked good, I really got that "we are in the 70's" vibe from it. Outfits, houses, knick knacks, hairstyles, cars, posters on the walls, it all gave us a good solid place to start from. It was cast pretty good as well, Mark Wahlberg belongs in that era for sure. Susie Salmon played by Saoirse Ronan can carry a drama as we have seen in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013XZ6X4">Atonement (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and the rest of the cast was adequate. Too bad that none of them really needed to have any acting skills, because Peter Jackson didnt write a movie that required them.<br />All the skills needed was a good set designer, hair and makeup and CGI expertise.<br /><br />This movie basically just took the story from the book, barely touched on the good parts or left them out all together, and then expected us to connect some dots that were never on the same page at the same time. Even if you had never read the book, you would leave feeling like something was missing. There was no character development, no crafting of the sense of Susie and her family and what they meant to eachother. There was no descriptions of the community in which this horrible crime took place, or any in depth look at the investigation itself! The scene where her mom and dad are in bed and crying about how she is gone forever...flat and deviod of any real emotions. We arent shown how this affected this family except for the father breaking his ships in a bottle and even that was empty.<br /><br />As for the "heaven" that Susie ends up in, I can only say that I was hoping that my TV had suddenly switched to cable and I watching some horrible Disney Channel tweens daydream while she was in math class. I felt like Lisa Frank <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PLRDR6">Lisa Frank Motivational Stickers - Over 1500!</a>decided to direct this instead of Jackson.<br /><br />The characters of Ray, Ruth, Detective Fenerman, Buckley, Lindsey, Holly, and even Abby and Jack were never explored!! Even the main character of Susie? What do we get from what they showed us? Barely anything for us to sit down for 2 hours and whatever minutes and care about the outcome.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones needed to be made into a movie, but it should have been done ina way where it honored the book and how powerful it was. This version, didnt. I cannot recommend this to any fan of the book, or even someone looking for a dramatic movie to watch.<br /><br />a reviewer from [..] said it best "The Lovely Bones is pretty much what I anticipated from the director of an epic trilogy of plus-sized fantasy flicks and an oversized remake of a classic, lean thriller. Jackson is so in love with the material and the premise that he can't resist expanding upon its themes, conflating them with his own ideas on grief, mortality, and the rich fantasy life of teenage girls. The film veers uneasily between entrancing poetry and wrongheaded melodrama, stopping along the way for left-field slapstick and old school cheap thrills"</p></body></html>

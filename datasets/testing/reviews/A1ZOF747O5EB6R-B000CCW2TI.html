<meta name="summary" content="A Modern Hitchcock"></head><body><p>Although in many respects predictable, "Red Eye" is still quite capable of keeping the viewer on the edge of his or her seat.  Yes, good does triumph over evil at the end of the day - this is, after all, Hollywood - but only after the viewer is taken on a roller coaster ride of emotions.<br /><br />A brief synopsis of the film is that there is a complex plot to assassinate the director of Homeland Security while he is visiting Miami.  A key to achieving this end is that his hotel room must be changed from one that is deemed secure to one that the assassins believe they can breach.  To make the room change, the hotel is manager is threatened while returning from Texas to Miami.  She must arrange the change over the phone otherwise her father will be killed.<br /><br />Director, Wes Carven, whose background is in films of the horror genre, deftly adapts to a more mainstream production.  Indeed, it is Craven's cinematic skill that permits this film to soar above lesser films of the same genre.  Craven shows some skills of a Hitchcock nature particularly, yet subtly, the clever use of music to heighten moments of suspense.<br /><br />I recommend this film as top quality escapist drama.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Epic Proportions"></head><body><p>One of the pleasures of my current job is that I selecting movies for this various  film series I run.  My current series is "100 Years, 100 Movies: Selections From the American Film Institute," and while I don't have the rights to screen EVERY selection, the many that I have gotten to show have initiated a good deal of discussion and debate among my attendees as to what makes a film a classic.<br /><br />Even at a glance at the AFI's roster of classic films, it was pretty clear that a wide variety of subjects, styles and genres would be open to us.  Greatness doesn't come in a one-size-fit-all format.  We began our series with CASABLANCA,  certainly a classic of its era--but one that caught its audience,  the critics and, yes,  even the actors and filmmakers by surprise. Shot in elegant black-and-white,  CASABLANCA is not quite an example of film noir--but it does have its `noirish' aspects.  And by the standards of the day, it was not actually a low-budget venture, but still no one involved in the project realized they were making a classic<br /><br />You could say that lack of pretention proven to be part of the beauty of the film.  It's one of the big screen's little ironies that it is often that very lack of pretention that makes for classic cinema.  And just as frequently, the bigger, more epic productions turn out to be bloated, boring and sometimes ludicrously bad.<br /><br />But not always.  Cinema can do many things, and in the right hands, a screen epic can be a wondrous thing to behold.  British director David Lean (1908-1991) is generally considered one of the masters of mid-20th century epic cinema (with such films to his credit as BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI,  DR. ZHIVAGO, and especially LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, hailed as the best epic film of all time by the American Film Institute,  the magazine Total Film and many others critics, film societies and publications.<br /><br />Aside from the twenty years--and all the attendant technical advancements between 1942 and 1962--that separated CASABLANCA and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA,  the two films do have a number of points in common: both speak to a certain fascination with exotic locales, the machinations and intrigues of war, and both pose questions about the nature of heroism and sacrifice.  And is it just coincidence, that both feature veteran character actor Claude Rains in co-starring roles?  (Who knows?  Maybe David Lean was indulging in a subtle kind of "stunt casting.")<br /><br />LAWRENCE OF ARABIA remains one of the most widely respected and influential films ever made.  While some have questioned its historical accuracy,  others have championed its cinematic beauty (and, yes, this is definitely one to view in letterbox format).Its visual style has influenced directors as diverse as Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah and George Lucas. You can't get more diverse than that, and that very roster gives you an idea of how the notion of "epic cinema" has expanded over the decades.<br /><br />The film is also noted for its literate screenplay (another trait it shares with CASABLANCA and so many other "classic films") and for Peter O'Toole's impressive star turn in the title role.  O'Toole had appeared in smaller roles in three movies prior to making this film.  Interestingly, hewas not the first choice for the part, but Marlon Brando was not available, and Albert Finney turned down the role.  Producer Sam Spiegel had worked with O'Toole previously and wasn't eager to work with the Irish born actor again.  He did, however, yield to director Lean's better judgment--and the rest, as they say, is movie history.<br /><br />It's ironic that the film many consider to be the greatest epic of all time was made in the era (the early `60s) when the genre could be said to be winding down.  (But as suggested by the list of filmmakers who've felt LAWRENCE's influence, MAYBE the genre was just being redefined).  It was clear even then that the days of lengthy, grandiose film with a "cast of thousands," and actual intermissions were on the wane.<br /><br />It probably can be said in more recent years,  "epics" tend to be more in the sci-fi and fantasy realm, with the vert occasional historical film<br />surfacing from time to time.  It's ironic that the film many think of as the cinema's GREATEST epic was--in a technical sense anyway--one of the last true examples of the genre.  It probably had a lot to do with budgets, and with changing public tastes.  But then took, maybe LAWRENCE OF ARABIA just set too high a bar.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unstoppable....a train wreck!!"></head><body><p>"Unstoppable" was directed by Tony Scott and stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson in this story of a half-mile long runaway train that is compared in dialogue to a missile heading towards very populated areas. These characters all dance around the train, but the train itself in all its fire engine red glory is the star. How I wish they had just put more stuff in front of the train for it to destroy...<br /><br />The movie introduces the characters quickly. Chris Pine is Will, a rookie conductor trying to make ends meet while being separated from his wife and kid after a misunderstanding. Denzel Washington plays Frank, part of the old guard in the train yards and resentful of newbies coming in and taking their jobs. There's a bit of tension but eventually they will begrudgingly respect each other through the upcoming crisis.<br /><br />Some dimwits eating fast food and rushing their word accidentally set a large train in motion that has failed air brakes and accidentally put itself into gear. In a different light, the director could've played the possessed train with a taste for vengeance card, but instead it focuses on the fact that the doofusses were being morons. Rosario Dawson plays Connie, the woman communicating between all the trains and attempting to avert disaster while being stuck under management's thumb.<br /><br />Something that really bothers me about Tony Scott films is the shaky, blurry camera work to introduce a movie and make it INTENSE. He did the same thing with another train film, this one underground "Pelham 123". It's almost unwatchable. Very predictable. Dan turned to me before it started and asked, "How much you wanna bet it opens with a sunrise coming over the train yard with a train drifting into view" and BAM! There it was. Our big bad mean train is so cleverly painted RED so you'll never miss it in any shot. The little tiny train that Frank and Will drive is blue, the same color as Thomas the Tank engine and it's old and has everything against it, but darn-it-all, it's going to be the "little engine that could" by the end of this, you can just smell it.<br /><br />The train's speed starts high and just gets higher. Even when it's going 10mph, it looks like it's going 60 in the opening shots so the challenge Tony Scott has to face is how to make an already ridiculously fast looking train, get FASTER! There are tons of close calls and a cheap teases that children are going to be injured. And "Unstoppable"? Spoiler alert, it's false advertising. ;-)  Fine for a random high-speed action movie, but you won't really care about the characters, just the train hitting stuff.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The Bonus Features are all starring THE TRAIN. In "The Fastest Track: Unleashing Unstoppable", Tony Scott discusses his love affair with helicopters, using them, shooting from them and how no one does train movies (except him I guess) and he really loves trains. In "Derailed: Anatomy of a Scene", you get to see the behind-the-scenes look at...a really fast train and the stunts that go along with it. Specifically in "Hanging off the Train: Stunt work", you see Chris Pine getting pelted with Sugar Puffs five inches away from serious injury. "On the Rails with the Director and Cast" is where the cast and Tony Scott stop and talk about how important it was to have such a good story and these "well-developed" characters (two of which work at Hooter's) and how that factored into deciding to do the movie. Yeaaaahh. I'm pretty sure it was for the train. ;-) There's another feature on script development, but we know that part wasn't extremely important and audio commentary with director Tony Scott involves him talking about the characters and story, but he really focuses on trains, cars, and helicopters.</p></body></html>

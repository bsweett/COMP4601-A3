<meta name="summary" content="Surprising"></head><body><p>I like Ashton Kutcher as a comedic character, but I really didn't have much faith in him to carry off this roll.  I was pleasantly surprised he did so well.  Ashton's character is followed from boyhood to young adult.  He has always suffered from blackouts in which he can't remember some of the terrible things that have happened in his life.  He finds a unique power that inables him to go back in time to change a signifigant event.  But the problem with changing just one thing in the past is the ripple effect, and each time he makes a change he comes back to a very differant future for himself.  The movie involves him just trying to make things right for himself and the ones he loves.  Well produced film.  This dvd is loaded with extras.  I would certainly go with the director's cut.  It adds more depth to the film and the ending is terrific.</p></body></html>

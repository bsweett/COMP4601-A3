<meta name="summary" content="A Quick Review & A Look At The Exclusive 3 Disc Version..."></head><body><p>What can I say, this update disapointed me. While the introduction and history of the pre-teen Michael Myers was nice as a prequel of sorts, the almost word-for-word remake of that fateful Halloween night fifteen years when "He" came home lacked the same spark as the first time around. Each new actor seemed to turn in a murder-by-numbers approach with the established characters, and the movie's new ending really paled in comparision to the 1978 original. While to any fan of the Halloween franchise should see this at least once, it will definitely NOT replace your yearly viewings of the original. If only Rob Zombie concentrated on making a prequel only instead of this watered down attempt to lure a new generation of audiences, this could have been a little more satifiying.<br /><br />While I'm here, let me let others in on what exactly is on that Circuit City exclusive bonus third disc. First off, it's in a paper sleeve (not part of the original packaging), that has only one extra feature, a 20 minute discussion with Rob Zombie & three other cast members at Comic-Con 2007. In fact, it doesn't even have a menu, just plop in the disc and it begins. I was wondering why this wasn't just put on the 2 disc as maybe an easter egg or something, it should have fit in the space nicely. Oh, and concerning that regular's second disc....if you missed Malcolm McDowell's personality from "A Clockwork Orange" after he made that film, check out the 10 minutes of Bloopers with him, he's a riot, almost as if this film brought out the lost "Alex De Large" outta him again. It's just too bad it didn't show during the actual movie.<br /><br />Overall, the extra features were more entertaining than the movie. A movie that didn't need to be remade, but worth one look as to see why not.</p></body></html>

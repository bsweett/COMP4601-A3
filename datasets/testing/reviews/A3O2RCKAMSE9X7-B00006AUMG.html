<meta name="summary" content="Blade 2: The World is Full of Vampires"></head><body><p>Do you remember the vampire movies pre 1990?  These vampires preferred to go solo.  Usually, someone was foolish enough to open a long-sealed crypt and let loose the undead, usually Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee.  The released vampire would generally spread havoc until he was staked through the heart.  He did not have to worry about competition from other vampires. Doctor Van Helsing would keep him busy until the climax.  But times have changed and so has Hollywood's vision of the undead. No longer is the vampire the well-dressed stalker who strikes at night.  Now, Hollywood has given the MTV generation a cooler and hipper set of vampires.  Director Guillermo Del Toro in BLADE 2 continues his own tradition as presenting not one but hundreds of vampires dancing in discos and acting like the spike-headed punkheads that Hollywood seems sure represent the bulk of the paying audience.  Wesley Snipes is Blade, a half-human martial-arts vampire who is immune to the sun and to garlic.  In the first BLADE, he rips apart legions of vampires, who promptly dub him Daywalker, since he fears not the sun.  In BLADE 2, Snipes reprises his role that permits him to engage in non-stop action from the opening to the closing credits.  When he reaches a moment that in another film another lead might pause for reflection, Snipes wastes not one moment in idle thought.  He uses his considerable physical presence to dominate each scene with breathtaking special effects that the audience has since come to expect.  And therein lies the problem with this movie and others of its ilk.  Believability and cause and effect were deliberately excluded from the script.  The world of BLADE 2 seems peopled exclusively by vampires of various sorts.  The garden variety vampires look, act, and speak like the middle class wannabe punkheads that they truly are.  If the script did not inform us they were vampires, I might never have guessed.  The only surprising variation was the introduction of a new breed of uber-vampires, who look more like the classical vampires of the past. These uber-vampires feed exclusively on the 'normal' vampires and are immune to the garlic and silver weaponry that used to work in the American International pictures.  These new vampires generally lope after their undead victims as if they were more chimpanzees than vampires.  Snipes battles both types of vampire before he agrees to focus his efforts only on this new breed.  There is absolutely no logic to his actions.  Both breeds of vampires are set up as straw men, only to be knocked down, while all the while the audience is oohing and ahhing over each more spectacular battle.  Kris Kristofferson is wasted as Whistler, Snipes' buddy, as only one of two humans in the movie.  The other human is a sleazy lawyer who allies himself to the undead in a way that critiques the often heartless profession of attorneying.  The plot bounces from one pyrotechnic display of blood and martial arts to the next with nary a thoughtful moment in between.  By the movie's end, I had long since ceased to care which breed of vampire would reign supreme over a world that seemed to lack non-vampire residents. That both Blade movies have proved to be rousing financial successes has filled me with regret that the day of the solo vampire has passed away to be replaced by non-thinking types whom surely Bela Lugosi would not have called kin.</p></body></html>

A devoutly religious man, he was also a heroin addict who suffered with habitual infidelity, and many a bad decision along his road to fame and fortune. Many have noted the connection between his drug addiction and his lyrical talents, but the movie delves deeper into how Music was not only his salvation, but also a shield and an extension of his inner self that helped him try to overcome his blindness. Being a black man in racially segregated 1948 America, and coming from very humble beginnings in Florida would have been hard enough; but carrying the disability of no sight also from aged 7 leaves one hardly being able to imagine the difficulties he overcame. The movie centers on the 50's and 60's predominantly, and the period detail and recreation are excellent, as is the supporting cast. Another review has mentioned how you forget that you are watching an actor, such is the strength of Foxx's portrayal, and that in itself is a mammoth task when dealing with any biopic, let alone a musical icon of Charles stature. Well deserving of the Oscar for best actor, Foxx undoubtedly carries the film. The music is great, and the selections chosen for the movie mirror perfectly the era shown before you. I highly recommend this movie, not only to those who enjoy Ray's music, but to anyone with a love of great drama, and an interest in one of the great entertainers this country has produced. The  DVD  is also packed with extra's that I didn't have time to view (as I had only borrowed the copy I viewed) and the sound and picture quality are excellent, especially when used through a surround or auxiliary speaker set up. Great Movie - Enjoy!</p></body></html>

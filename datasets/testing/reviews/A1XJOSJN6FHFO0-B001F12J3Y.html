Have you lost the faith of your childhood and the simply joy of believing? Life deals us with some rough blows, times are often more hard than easy and sometimes hopelessnss is much easier to give into than faith.<br /><br />  This movie is about believing, it is about faith, love, hope. It isn't so much about believing in Santa Claus but its more about believing in something that you can hold onto. I think it was well done, characters were wonderful, visual great; I loved it all as did my granddaughter.  If you have not seen this movie yet do yourself a favor and watch it with someone you love.</p></body></html>

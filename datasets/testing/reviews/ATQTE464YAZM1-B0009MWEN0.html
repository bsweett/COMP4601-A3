<meta name="summary" content="Bad as an adaptation, bad as a movie..."></head><body><p>I've read the book &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and its one of my favorite novels. I actually brought a copy of it with me when I saw this movie in theaters...and as the ending credits appeared I turned to the book and personally apologized to Robert Heinlein for it.<p>The movie distorts things from the book and is about as faithful as James Mason's &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth.&quot; In the novel you didn't have to join the military to earn citizenship, Dizzy was a guy and died in the first ten pages, and other facts I could go on about.<p>Of course, even if it weren't based off a book, its still a bad movie. The mobile infantry isn't very mobile, the equipment consists of cheap plastic armor and a t-shirt, and the inter-gender shower scene seems thrown in just so the advertisers could say, &quot;Hey! We have nudity!&quot; Not to mention the romance is unnecessary, unromantic, uninteresting, and seems just thrown in there. Hell, if Johnny (who wasn't white in the novel...) likes his girlfriend so much, why does he cheat with Dizzy? Poor character development.<p>The only likeable character is Sgt. Zim. Thats probably because the man who played Sgt. Zim was one of the only cast members who actually read the book. Reading an interview with him, I realized he must have known more about the book than the producers and director combined.<p>Starship Troopers could have been made into a great movie. Sadly, this is not it.</p></body></html>

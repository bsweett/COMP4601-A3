This is the main plot of DOUBT, though as with any film of this nature, there's much more to it: tolerance, sexism, and yes, doubt in many of its forms.  This creates a slow-moving film that may not be for all viewers; it is a film made to make you think--especially the final confrontation between Streep and Hoffman, and viewers with little patience will come away somewhat disappointed.  That cannot be helped.<br /><br />There is a reason why four of DOUBT's principle actors were nominated for awards: This film is driven by its actors, namely Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis.  Hoffman is in strong form as always; Davis, in her too-brief role, is a marvel; Adams proves yet again she is a very reliable actress.  It is, however, Streep who steals the show, diving headlong into the character of a traditional nun who resents the presence of a reform-minded priest.  The actors help the film avoid the many pitfalls--too many dramatic camera angles, a couple of minor subplots that are distracting.  The theme is strong and well-carried out (this film was also nominated for its script, and rightly so), but it is up to the actors to make everything work.  And they do.  If nothing else, DOUBT is proof that there are genuinely talented actors still working in Hollywood, and filmmakers willing to challenge their viewers, even if it means low Box Office receipts and certain audience members getting offended (lets face it, it always happens).</p></body></html>

Yes, it's not supposed to be about Johnny Cash as much as it is about his stormy early relationship with his soul mate June Carter, but even insofar as it is that, Walk the Line is not even a very strong love story. Good performances are here, though, from several actors, but I was disappointed in Walk the Line, mostly because this film wasn't what it could have been or should have been or what I wanted it to be. I know it wasn't my production and others, including Johnny Cash, who gave his approval to the project before his passing, made this the story they wanted to tell, but speaking personally, I think this was both a needless assault on a cherished myth and a bit of a tall tale in itself that sacrificed fact for drama and re-wrote entire timelines. I know we live in the golden age of bringing down heroes and showing that the famous are as fallible as the rest of us, but why on earth concentrate on the aspects of the Cash's relationship that were so overly emphasized in Walk the Line? And then why re-imagine them when the truth made a better story in itself? Johnny Cash was a legend and deserves his own tribute in film. Maybe someday.</p></body></html>

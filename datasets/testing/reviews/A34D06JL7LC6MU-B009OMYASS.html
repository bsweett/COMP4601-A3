<meta name="summary" content="Still Has Room to Grow, But It's a Triumph for Horror Films"></head><body><p>In 2002 or 2003, I forget which, Eli Roth gave us "Cabin Fever" his first film.<br /><br />I liked it, but have yet to meet a single person who also liked it. Critics hated it, the people on Amazon hate it. But, after seeing the preview for this movie during "Saw II" I thought it looked pretty good. Oh, and Quentin Tarantino is the Executive Producer. Basically all Tarantino did was sign on as Executive Producer, so they could put his name on their posters, and he picked up his paycheck. The thing is, Tarantino isn't one of those directors who sells out and does whatever he can for money. Tarantino liked this script or he wouldn't have had anything to do with it. I'm not saying that's a reason to see it, after all he liked "Wolf Creek" which I hated, so...But, horror fans should see this movie. Eli Roth still has a long way to go before making a quote "good movie", but Roth does know how to structure and execute a horror film. He's clearly inspired by early horror films, because this movie has exactly what those did. Lots of gore, lots of violence, lots of language, and LOTS OF NUDITY! In fact, the latter is pretty much what the entire plot of the film revolves around. The movie stars Jay Hernandez (Crazy/Beautiful) and Derek Richardson (Dumb & Dumberer) as two American college students named Paxton and Josh. Traveling with their Icelandic friend Oli (Eythor Godjonsson, who's really funny) the trio travel through Europe with the sole goal of getting laid and smoking pot. In one city, they come close (Paxton & Oli score, but Josh doesn't) and when they're kicked out of their hostel (the european named for hotel) they meet up with a creepy looking guy named Alex who tells them of beautiful women willing to do anything. All they have to do is travel to Slovakia. So, naturally they do and exactly what Alex promises them comes into focus. But, the next morning Oli is missing. So, as Paxton and Josh look for him they end up somewhere they didn't expect to end up...Which, if you've seen the previews is obviously a torture chamber. There's a "twist" at the end of the movie which you're given enough clues to figure out early on, but I didn't.<br /><br />A lot of people write about this, which in my opinion can actually ruin the effect the end product has. But, anyways, Roth has obviously improved over "Cabin Fever". He's been compared to Rob Zombie, who's first film "House of 1000 Corpses" was recieved about as well as "Cabin Fever". And who's second film "The Devil's Rejects" got good reviews and was actually one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite movies of 2005. Well, Roth isn't better than Zombie. But, I do respect Roth for what he tries to do. He tries to entertain us, gross us out, make us flinch, and make us laugh. And he actually succeeds at all of them. Sure, not all the characters are that smart and, like all horror films, their are decisions that could be made early on in the film and save the characters life, but this is a good horror movie. It's better than "Wolf Creek" by quite a margin and while some recent horror films easily surpass it (The "Saw" series, anyone?) it's still a really good for hardcore horror fans.<br /><br />GRADE: B+</p></body></html>

The Bridge on the River Kwai is a 1957 British World War II film directed by David Lean. It stars William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and was shot in Sri Lanka. It is a war classic on every level. The acting, story, dialogue, and philosophy all put forth in this forth are excellent. A unit of British soldiers are captured and marched to a Japanese prison camp in western Thailand. At this camp they are forced to build an extremely important railroad bridge for the Japanese.  Throughout this challenge the unit is led valiantly by their commander, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness). The Colonel is really the centerpiece and most important character in the film. He is always pushing forward, staying positive, professional, and determined no matter how dismal the situation may appear to be. The talent and integrity Alec Guinness displayed in this role won him the well deserved Best Actor Academy Award. Watch this film and contemplate a path of enlightenment that applies to war, peace, and everything in between.<br /><br />Colonel Nicholson: It is quite understandable; it's a very natural reaction. But one day - in a week, a month, a year - on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again, you're going to feel very proud of what you have achieved here in the face of great adversity. What you have done should be, and I think will be, an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike. You have survived with honor - that, and more - here in the wilderness. You have turned defeat into victory. I congratulate you. Well done.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Quirky, twenty-something saga"></head><body><p>You know the story--a young, numb, marginally successful Hollywood actor returns home for his mother's funeral, leaving his anti-depressants--a truly impressive array--behind. In the space of four days he revisits his friends--all losers in their own way--, finds the love of his life, kicks his mind-numbing therapy and forgives his father for severly over-medicating him for some 15 years. I can see how this appealed to younger movie goers, but I couldn't quite swallow it all. Andrew's ability to overcome these obstacles almost instantaneously was unrealistic, and I thought the movie lacked a point of view about the events around him--particularly about the father, whose conduct was grossly unethical, and Andrew's despicable friend Mark. I guess you have to be twenty-something. . . . .</p></body></html>

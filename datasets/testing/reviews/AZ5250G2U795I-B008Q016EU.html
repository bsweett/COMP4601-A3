<meta name="summary" content="I Dare you Not to Love This Movie!"></head><body><p>Shakespeare...uh...NO.  90 minutes of pure fun...You BETCHA!<p>I saw this movie in the theaters and the first thought I had was 'When is the DVD coming out?  I GOTTA HAVE THIS MOVIE!'  Drew, Cameron, and Lucy have perfectly embodied the old angle archetype in a 21st century way.  Hard to describe, but watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.  And whoever snagged Bill Murray as Bosley is a Casting Director's Casting Director!<p>If you want sheer fun, not a serious amount of plot (And don't worry, the movie knows it's not gunning for a best picture story or anything), and GREAT fight scenes, then click right now!</p></body></html>

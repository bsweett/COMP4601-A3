<meta name="summary" content="Robin Williams' worst movie to date...."></head><body><p>Okay so that may be overstating but honestly there was not much to like about this movie. The oddest moment is when he breaks into someone's house essentially to use their toilet.<br /><br />I get it... he wants to be a part of their lives. He lives vicariously though those with whom he is connected via their photographs.<br /><br />What should have been an interesting plot starring an uber-talented actor falls flat in the less than talented hands of either the writer or director. Not sure which one dropped the ball here but somebody did... and Robin Williams's best performance couldn't have saved this film.</p></body></html>

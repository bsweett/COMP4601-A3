<meta name="summary" content="Nice spoof of the Buddy Cop Film"></head><body><p>My only gripe is that it goes on a tad too long; however, the movie is very funny. Some of the gags are subtle. It reminds of a "Fawlty Towers" script. Some of the gags don't really come into fruitition until the end of the movie. The good cops were likeable characters and the villians were funny. The plot made no sense really, but it flowed pretty well and the laughs kept on coming so that I didn't care. Timothy Dalton was very good at being obviously evil and smarmy. Edward Woodward was good to see as well.  Broadbent and Cranham played off each really well in sort of a Laurel and Hardy team. The actors took the movie fairly seriously so that added to the charm as well.<br /><br />The movie is laugh out loud funny in spots.</p></body></html>

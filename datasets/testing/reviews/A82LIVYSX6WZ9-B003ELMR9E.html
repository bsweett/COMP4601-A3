<meta name="summary" content="mind-blowing performances by Pacino and Williams"></head><body><p>Pacino and his partner played by Martin Donovan(Agent Cody Banks) are set to a town where there is not darkness, or where they see no moon but its sunshiny out. their investigating a murder of a young girl and the killer is on the loose. Pacino partners up with Hilary Swank(Boys Dont Cry) and Nicky Katt(Suburbia), and they go to a place by the lake where they might find the killer, surley enough some nicely done suspense is put in there as Pacino shoots his partner on accident and kills him and he covers it up and the real killer saw it, who just happens to be Mr. Robin Williams(who is creepy and mind-blowing). its a great game between them and it ends with Williams shooting Pacino and then Pacino shotgun blasts Williams and then Pacino confesses to Swank about everything as she holds him on that walkway. if your renting movies or buying, rent or buy this one or Williams other creepy movie One Hour Photo</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Quite Good Film!!"></head><body><p>Due to working at a video store, and being interuppted by customers, I had to watch this one twice.  Content was excellent, and it was one of those that you just have to find out what happens!! Robin Williams was great in the movie as well. One of the best dark and sinister characters he has played!!  Al Pacino does a great job with the material!! Fun, edge of your seat entertainment!!!</p></body></html>

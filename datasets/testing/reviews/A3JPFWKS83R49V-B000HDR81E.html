<meta name="summary" content="The Break Up is One Irritating Film"></head><body><p>The Break Up is a an annoying film that presents a couple on the brink of all- out personal warfare over a relationship gone bad. This movie features plenty of yelling, deceitfulness, game playing, and other things that are common when a relationship has reached its final hours.<br /><br />I can remember when this film was first released and it seemed intriguing. Based on the advertisements for the film, it looked like it would be an entertaining romantic comedy. It fact, it is neither romantic nor funny. There are dashes of humor at the beginning of the film but little else. The movie is mostly serious all the way with Vaughn and Aniston arguing almost non- stop until the very end of the film when they become civil once more.<br /><br />Vaughn and Aniston were known to be personally involved with each other during the time this movie was being filmed and this fact gave me the impression that the movie would offer great chemistry and passion. But Vaughn and Aniston do not seem right in this movie. They don't seem like a likely couple and many film critics have correctly pointed out that the two were not very good together in this film.<br /><br />What really bothered me most with this movie is how irritated I felt as I watched! Vaughn and Aniston continuously trade barbs with each other and Vaughn acts impatient and irritating even when he is with friends. Watching the film actually elevated my blood pressure and raised my stress level. I watched it with the hope of viewing a lightened up comedy that would serve as a good after- work stress reliever. Instead, I felt the urge to blow off steam when the movie was finally over. This drama might be the type that some bickering couples can relate to but not only could I not relate, my tolerance for this film continued to decline with each minute. I just wanted it to end to put me out of my misery.<br /><br />There are a few redeeming qualities with this movie, like the individual performances by the various cast members. But the main problem with the acting is that the performers and performances don't seem to gel. The characters are fine on their own, but they don't have the on- screen chemistry so desperately needed to make this film work. It all ads up to a frustrating film that should be avoided.</p></body></html>

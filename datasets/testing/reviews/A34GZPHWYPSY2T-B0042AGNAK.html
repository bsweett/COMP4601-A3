This is one of the the worst films I have ever seen, if it can even be called a film. Nicholas Cage was duped into reprising his role as Johnny Blaze, the Ghost Rider, in a stupidly contrived remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JJCMOO">The Prophecy Collection</a> series. Here he is asked by a pointless character to save the life of a boy who could wind up becoming the antichrist.<br /><br />The trick is to nab the kid and get him to some creepy Orthodox Christian monastery where he will be protected from the dark angel. Of course, the pathetic excuses for cinema on display here are endless, so ....<br /><br />Let me describe what is wrong here. Marvel Comics is clearly at the end of its rope, and this film with its trying stupidity is proof that Marvel and Hollywood need to part ways now. What is supposed to pass for humor here was done a million times better in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICXQOM">Army of Darkness</a>. What's worse, I despise the manipulation of children as cinematic tools, of which this film absolutely reeks. I also deplore the mockery of any religion in film, in this case, of the Catholic Church. This "scary" garbage is nothing more than a mindless music video of violence and gore.</p></body></html>

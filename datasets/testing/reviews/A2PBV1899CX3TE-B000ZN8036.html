<meta name="summary" content="Why are you so 'Into' Into the Wild?"></head><body><p>Into the Wild has been in my friend's DVD player for about a month. She has been watching it constantly. I finally got a chance to see for myself, and found it to be a fascinating and compelling story, based on a real person, who may have been tilting at windmills like Don Quixote in his quest for freedom and survival in the extremes of wild nature, but nevertheless, touched the lives of all he encountered along the way.<br /><br />Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) has just graduated from college, with excellent grades, but instead of either graduate school or a career, he chooses instead to go into the wild. He donates his trust fund to charity, burns his money, and abandons his car. He renames himself Alexander Supertramp, and begins his quest to live up to his new name. His parents, Walt and Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt) are bewildered and hire an investigator to find him, but to no avail. His sister Carine, who also serves as an additional narrator, is hurt that he doesn't call her, either. But she offers insight into what may have driven him off, comparing him to fine crystal that nevertheless is fragile and needs protection.<br /><br />Along the way he meets hippies Rainey & Jan Burres (Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener). Later, he works on a farm for Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn). He also befriends lonely leather engraver Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook). He kayaks all the way to Mexico and back, rides the rails, visits Slab City in the desert, works in a fast food restaurant, always working towards his goal of surviving a harsh winter in the wilds of Alaska. He reaches Alaska and makes his final stand in an abandoned bus...<br /><br />Into the Wild was directed by Sean Penn. Great job, Sean. He waited 10 years to make the film, making sure that he had the approval and support of the McCandless family. Everything was filmed on location, and Sean Penn takes full advantage with excellent cinematography. Some of the cast were the actual people from the real life story, such as Jim Gallien, who gives the wanderer boots as he goes into the wild. Brian Deirker was originally hired as a technical consultant for the river rafting, but at Emile Hirsch's suggestion, cast in the role of hippie motorhomer Rainey.<br /><br />It features music composed and performed by Eddie Vedder. When Sean Penn called and asked him to do it, he agreed on the spot. I am not a fan of Pearl Jam, mainly because of Vedder's voice, which sounds phoney and cartoonish. But he has really matured, and there is just a touch of the cartoonishness in his voice to give it a bit of character and identity. The music is excellent, great acoustic guitar and the singing surprisingly good, it really adds to the film experience. Vedder does the bulk of the music, but there are also a few songs by Kaki King, some others, and of course we get to hear Roger Miller's "King of the Road," which is paraphrased and quoted in the final manifesto.<br /><br />Besides the music, there are also quotes from literature on title cards between scenes, such as:<br /><br />There is a pleasure in the pathless woods<br />(from Childe Harold, Canto iv, Verse 178)<br /><br />There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,<br />There is a rapture on the lonely shore,<br />There is society, where none intrudes,<br />By the deep sea, and music in its roar:<br />I love not man the less, but Nature more,<br /><br />  -- Lord Byron, (George Gordon)<br /><br />The cast was all really good, with the well known actors and unknowns alike seeming totally authentic. I especially liked Vince Vaughn as someone who both mocks and admires the young man's ambitions. "Can't be juggling blood and fire all the time!"<br /><br />Also there is a great encounter with Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook). The lonely old man looks askance at Supertramp's vagabond lifestyle, but considers his challenge to get out of his workshop and see the world. The encounter offers director Sean Penn a great chance for his protagonist to illustrate his saga by carving his story onto a leather belt:<br /><br />Ron Franz: What does the "N" stand for?<br />Christopher McCandless: North.<br />Ron Franz: [sounding surprised and frustrated] Alaska?<br /><br />Once he reaches Alaska, he continues carving out his story on a board he finds in the 'Magic Bus.'<br /><br />Christopher McCandless: Two years he walks the earth. No phone, no pool, no pets, no cigarettes. Ultimate freedom. An extremist. An aesthetic voyager whose home is the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou shalt not return, 'cause "the West is the best." And now after two rambling years comes the final and greatest adventure. The climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual pilgrimage. Ten days and nights of freight trains and hitchhiking bring him to the Great White North. No longer to be poisoned by civilization he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild. - Alexander Supertramp May 1992<br /><br />10 movies that pertain to Into the Wild<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NO39FG">Alpha Dog (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2006) ....

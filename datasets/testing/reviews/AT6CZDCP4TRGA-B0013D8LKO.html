<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick does Freud..."></head><body><p>...who, in his classic work, "Civilization and Its Discontents" asserted that repression of the unconscious is the foundation of what we consider "civilization" and a necessary evil.  Not all that breathtaking or revolutionary of an idea by itself---in fact, it's something that most conservative folk would basically agree with, though instead of "repression of the unconscious" they'd probably say "morality" or some other nonsense.  But it's the same basic idea: the basement is infinitely dark and scary, and you may want to go down and look around once in a while, but it's nowhere you'd like to stay for long.<p>Part of the genius of Stanley Kubrick is his ability to take fairly commonplace things and elevate/magnify them into something much bigger and more interesting things than they normally are.  He does this hear with the two mediocre lead actors (Kidman and Cruise), and also with Freud's little truism above.  <p>Cruise is a handsome man, with lots of charisma, and has made a career of playing the seemingly carefree, cocksure alpha male---and his range is fairly limited to that.  Kidman here plays a woman at once ordinary and very sexual beneath the surface---even though she is a fairly attractive woman (often reminded me of a young Meg Ryan) "sexy" would normally be quite a stretch.  <p>Yet both actors pull it off: Cruise shows flashes of genuine anguish, and Kidman (with the help of lots of tasteful yet sensuous nudity, most notably of her remarkable derriere) does project something other than the prim-and-proper-little-girl persona she usually dons for most of her other films.  And the film itself often does feel like a dreamy descent into the subconscious and much of its contents: fear, lust, jealousym, obsessiveness, sexual confusion, mistrust, etc.<p>As long as you don't focus on "what's going to happen next?" and just soak in the magic of each NOW frame, you learn to appreciate the richness of the present moment.  <p>This movie DOES seem slower than most of Kubrick's films, but if you keep the allegory in mind, you start to enjoy the sheer visual mastery that's in almost every frame of any Kubrick film, the atmospherics, and of course the music, which was superbly integrated into the film.  I'd hesitate to say that this is Kubrick's best, but still pretty darn good by industry standards.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unforgiven - 1992's Best Picture winner!"></head><body><p>Unforgiven is clearly among the top westerns ever made.  This movie is simple, dark and yet highly complex in its superb script and the outstanding performances by all concerned.  Few westerns will draw you into the lead characters as this one does.  Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and the sorely missed Richard Harris all deserved awards for their collective performances.  What is a western without Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman!<p>The premise:<p>Welcome to Big Whiskey Wyoming, where in a small "billiards" saloon, a cowboy gets angry at a whore and, with the help of his buddy, cuts her face up.  The other "women" of the establishment, pool their money and start telling everybody that they're offering a reward to whoever kills these two young cowboys.  This is precipitated by Gene Hackmans character Little Bill, who essentially doesn't punish them for their crime.  <p>Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, who in his earlier days was every bit one of the worst, meanest gunslingers in the west.  Some ten years prior to the events at the beginning of this fine film, William Munny met his wife Claudia, who turned this serious gunslinger into a family man, unfortunately for him and his little children, his wife died three years prior.  He is now a poor pig farmer, with two little children.<p>The son of one of his old riding buddies has heard about this reward and seeks out William Munnys assistance in tracking down these unpunished criminals.  After some hesitation, he seeks out his friend Ned, played by Morgan Freeman, one of the finest actors of our day.  The three of them head north to seek out the reward.<p>What follows is clearly a movie that while, for the better part is melodramatic; it is that melodrama that is gripping.  All those who received accolades for this fine film, richly deserved those accolades.<p>This exceptional film that graced the silver screen so beautifully and then the home theater, deserves a hallowed place on ones DVD rack and is perfectly well suited to repeated viewings.  I highly recommend this masterpiece to any and all, even those who may not find themselves interested in westerns will find this film highly compelling.  {ssintrepid}</p></body></html>

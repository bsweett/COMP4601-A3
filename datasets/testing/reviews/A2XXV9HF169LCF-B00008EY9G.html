(Of course, I knew nothing about the movie going into it.) <p>The twist in the middle threw me, I felt a bit put out by it. I never got completely back into the movie, but by the end I was mostly back in, and liked it well enough. <p>John Cussack is perfect; and a couple of the most violent bits become situationally expremely funny. The rest of the cast are also fairly perfect, but I am a Cussack fan at heart, and I liked his performance. <p>So... all in all? It was ok. I like it.</p></body></html>

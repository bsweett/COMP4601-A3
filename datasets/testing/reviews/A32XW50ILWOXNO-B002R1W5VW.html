<meta name="summary" content="Fishy ending dims Cage and Lohman's fantastic work"></head><body><p>"Matchstick Men" is film noir with a heart of gold, and it is worse off for its generosity. Ostensibly the tale of an obsessive/compulsive con man (Nicolas Cage) and a newly formed, world-shattering (for him) relationship with his 13-year-old daughter (Alison Lohman), Ridley Scott's film works toward something bigger, which, when revealed, is a fairly sharp right turn. <p>Imagine, then, an epilogue that turns just as sharply back to the left - duping the dupe, if you will - and you've approximated how "Matchstick Men" unfurls in its final 20 minutes. A cheat of a cheat is even dirtier than the real thing.<p>Back in a role that best fits his showboat antics, Cage is Roy, a barely functioning LA huckster who scams retirees with a showboat his equal, Frank (Sam Rockwell), who pines to play a large-sum con that Roy, millions in bank, doesn't need. Just how Roy has survived years of panic attacks brought on by loose carpet fibers and hamburger crumbs is left unsaid, but for the time being he pops illegal anti-depressants, until, during a fit, he loses them down the sink drain.<p>See a shrink, Frank helpfully suggests, going so far to "give him a name" of an amiable, soft-bellied practitioner (Bruce Altman) who gently nudges Roy to connect with Angela, a daughter he's never known, played by Lohman with a intelligence beyond, shall we say, her 13 years. Angela is like a serum for Roy's ailments - she so completely obliterates his home upon her first visit he can't help but submit to a cure. <p>It tricks him into accepting two things:  Frank's score and a vortex of trust toxic to a game grifter. <p>A literate, a-bing-bang-boom script from Ted and Nicolas Griffin, based on Eric Garcia's recent novel, is slightly short on originality -every con there is has been played on the big screen, after all - but long on speed and tight dialogue; it doesn't feature a wide cast, but draws clearly the principals.<p>Cage has generally been at his best when uninhibited, and Roy provides him the chance to play the gamecock dandy for all its worth: He struts and stutters and smokes and sweats so effectively, the audience is engaged in a kind of transference. Scott presents early panic scenes with such clarity and urgency that Angela's entrance in Roy's life works on us as much as it does Roy. <p>And Lohman, at 23, is terrific at the cute, smart kid, as good here as she was in "White Oleander;" that the father/daughter dynamic works at all is thanks to her performance, partially by design, when you think about it.  Rockwell is the goofy cowboy sidekick laying his own odds. And I like Altman as the shrink, in a more important role in the film than it seems.<p>The twist of "Matchstick Men" is there to see, but not in plain view; Scott plays to our growing distrust of the grift (and Angela) with a series of red flags that nevertheless don't diminish the stomach-panging moment the switch is flipped. Upon that scene's arrival, the movie has reached a suitable, logistic close, but an epilogue, following the title card "One Year Later," presents a pretty fishy (Who are we kidding? It's unbelievable) resolution to Roy's "journey of discovery." Quentin Tarantino has his own issues with his "Kill Bill," but I suspect he would have known how to put a final, crushing spin on the story without sacrificing the essential nature of a well-acted character.</p></body></html>

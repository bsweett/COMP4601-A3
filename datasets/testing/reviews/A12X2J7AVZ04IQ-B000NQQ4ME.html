His tabloid rap means nothing to me when watching his films, as the films of Roman Polanski, Elia Kazan or Leni Riefenstahl. "Apocalypto" had me from the first frame, and I thought it was another fine film from a fine director. It's known that the Mayans had gruesome sacrificial rites, far worse than what Mr. Gibson portrayed. Still, brutal and abrasive behavior abounds regarding simple human beings who simply live to survive. Vengeance and escape are the centers of this film about a man who simply wants to go back to his family. Once he thinks everything can be happy, the Europeans arrive...and that's a whole different story. I believe Mel Gibson is an impassioned director, making film of unusual interest, and totally in command of his material. Authenticity is of utmost importance, and I commend him for this effort.</p></body></html>

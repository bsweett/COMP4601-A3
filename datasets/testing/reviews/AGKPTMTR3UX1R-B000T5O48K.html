<meta name="summary" content=""Man, dont you bug me . . . I got my own bugs too.""></head><body><p>BUG is a rare film, a psychological thriller/horror film that really works. Ashley Judd plays a lonely waitress living in an SRO in a backwater desert town.<br /><br />Enter Michael Shannon, a wandering Gulf War vet with a dark secret. He claims to have been the subject of a U.S. Army experiment in which insect larvae have been implanted into his body. As the film builds in suspense, Shannon's delusions (?) become increasingly baroque, feeding themselves on Judd's intensifying suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Most of this film consists of Judd and Shannon alone in a room together, living out a folie-a-deux, a shared madness.<br /><br />Although BUG has a significant gross-out factor, it also has a hugely successful psychological fear factor, a rare commodity in present-day filmmaking. The increasingly florid Shannon slowly and inexorably turns Judd into a True Believer, with horrifying consequences.<br /><br />BUG will turn your stomach, but it will also play with your mind.</p></body></html>

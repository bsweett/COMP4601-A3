<meta name="summary" content="See for Kevin Spacey's Bravura Singing and Dancing"></head><body><p>This is no box-office hit, and ignored by Oscar, but 'Beyond the Sea' has lots of good things in it, even if you don't know anything about Bobby Darin.  Kevin Spacey made it publicly known that to make Bobby Darin's bio-pic had been his dream, and the film proves that he really meant it.  Though the film could be better with different approach, 'Beyond the Sea' is still impressive for its songs, dances, and acting.<br /><br />Though many remember him as the singer of pop songs like 'Splish Splash' 'Dream Lover' or various jazz numbers including 'Mack the Knife,' Bobby Darin did much more than that.  Born in 1936, Bobby Darin was Oscar nominated for his supporting role in 'Captain Newman, MD' in 1963; he sang a Tim Hardin folk rock song; and he hosted a TV show in the 70s.  Kevin Spacy as director and star follows the life of Bobby Darin from his childhood in Bronx to his early death.<br /><br />What is most memorable and amazing is the musical parts inserted here and there in the story.  Kevin Spacey is usually associated with the part of A) creepy guy or B) weird guy, but here he shows his side of great entertainer.  Not only he sings Bobby Darin songs himself, but shows amaaing dancing.  In fact, the film looks as if it stops to show his skills, and though some may say it's his vanity, his talent is still undeniable.<br /><br />The supprts include Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee, John Goodman, Bob Hoskins, Brenda Blethyn and Greta Scacchi.  Quite frankly, none of them are as effective as Kevin Sapcey, perhaps with an exception of Brenda Blethyn who disappears too soon from the film.  I really like Kate Bosworth (and I liked her in 'Blue Crush'), but there's hardly any chemistry between Spacey and her that makes us believe Bobby and Sandra are married.  Real Sandra Dee was younger than Bobby Darin by six years while Kate Bosworth, gifted as she is, is younger than Kevin Spacey by 24 years.  That's too much descrepancy.<br /><br />But my real complaint is not this: as some of you know, Bobby Darin knew he was not going to live long (see the film), and was determined to be a professional singer no matter what people say.  This is a great story, and Kevin Spacey must have known it.  However. Kevin somehow decided on using 'frames' or unorthdox storytelling (used also in 'De-Lovely') in which Kevin's Bobby sees his life, guided by a child actor playing Bobby Darin's childhood.  Why not use more orthodox way of telling a story when there is a good story at hand?<br /><br />At one scene (I don't say where), Kevin Spacey indirectly gives his answer to some of the media people who continues to say he is too old to play the role of Bobby Darin.  At another scene (in fact, it's opening), Kevin's Bobby Darin stops singing in the middle of 'Mack the Knife' and shows us that it's part of shooting the bio-pic of Bobby Darin.  Take away these self-conscious moments, which clearly lessen the impact of the story, and 'Beyond the Sea' would be much better.<br /><br />Still, the songs and dances are all great, full of energy and expert skills of first-rate artists.  I don't know you and your reaction, but I like this film as the showcase of Kevin Spacey's talent.</p></body></html>

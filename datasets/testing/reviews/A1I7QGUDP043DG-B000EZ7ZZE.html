You have the zombies, demon dogs, etc. as well as a monster who has 'very familiar eyes', but it seems a little dark and shadowy, which seems to rob it of some intensity. It feels more spooky than action packed. Perhaps because they're still stuck in the city fighting in and out of the buildings it just seems too cramped, and too much like the first. I did like it though and it's good enough to stand on its own without watching the first in the series.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

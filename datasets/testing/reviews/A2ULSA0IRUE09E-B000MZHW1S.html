<meta name="summary" content="Presenting Leonardo DiCaprio's Best Performance in a Film - EVER"></head><body><p>I am going to keep this review relevant to the movie and the reasons why you should buy this on DVD:<br /><br />1. Leonardo DiCaprio's Performance: This film in my opinion features the best ever performance extracted from Leonardo DiCaprio on film. He is flawless here as a South Africa white who needs to discover whether material wealth means more to him than human emotion and sentiment. I have never been a huge fan of Leo (though yes, he was wonderful in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" and "The Beach") but this film alongwith "The Departed" really opened my eyes. Granted he is a physically splendid creation, but his use of language, intonation and emotion were at the forefront of this movie, and the only downside to his performance is that it totally overshadowed the other actors.<br /><br />2. Djimon Hounsou's performance : This was an actor I first noticed in "Amistad" and he just keeps getting better and better. He is one actor who looks about 25 even though hes well past 40, and has an incredible range. His role as a traumatized father looking for his son in the middle of riot torn Africa will be remembered years to come, however, he is not as radiant as Leonardo here, and for that reason alone I think he is thought of as a "supporting actor" here. If you pay attention, you will actually see that he gets MORE screen time than Leo.<br /><br />3. Jennifer Connelly : I think she is one of the most ill-utilized actresses we have today, and the director doesn't do much with her here either, which is a pity. However, her role is quite effective for what it is - the downside being that she has zero chemistry with Leo in every regard.<br /><br />4. Cinematography : The effect here was to present Africa as a beautiful nation though ridden with political problems and woes. To see these violent images portrayed against a backdrop of the most gorgeous sunsets and tropical rainforests was a bit bizarre - which I suppose was the effect. The visuals are lush and evocative, and captures the mood of the era and environment perfectly.<br /><br />5. Direction & Story : The director knew a good thing when he saw it. This is a very character driven story and you have to FEEL for the characters' emotions if you want to get anywhere. On the surface, its a simple tale thats been told a million different ways, but the political statements this movie makes is way ahead of its' time, I thought (much like the Angelina Jolie starrer "Beyond Borders" which was a masterpiece in its' own right).<br /><br />It goes without saying that Leonardo DiCaprio carries this film on his capable shoulders and takes you through almost three gripping hours of it without making you look at your watch. This is what real acting and filmmaking is all about. If you do decide to buy this, let Leo be your number one reason.<br /><br />To wrap it up, this is a must have 2-DVD Edition of the film - and I can state that this is one movie you will be watching over and over. I saw this just after "The Departed", which is the only other movie this year I could possibly watch again. These two films finally signal the true emergence of America's greatest living actor - Leonardo DiCaprio.</p></body></html>

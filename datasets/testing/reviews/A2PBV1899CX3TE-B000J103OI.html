<meta name="summary" content="Dance with the Devil in Prada"></head><body><p>A delightful excursion through the world of Haute Couture<br /><br />and magazine publishing set amid glamorous Paris and New<br /><br />York. The film is an adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's<br /><br />best-seller, which was based on Anna Wintour (Editor-in-<br /><br />Chief of the U.S. edition of Vogue). Andy Sachs (Anne<br /><br />Hathaway) seems a fish out of water when she interviews<br /><br />for a job as the second-assistant to Miranda Priestly<br /><br />(Meryl Streep), editor of high fashion magazine, Runway.<br /><br />Andy wants to be journalist, and is only working there to get survive until she gets a break for her writing.<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: ...You have no sense of fashion...<br /><br />Andy Sachs: I think that depends on...<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: No, no, that wasn't a question.<br /><br />But Andy is smart, though at first naive, and after being<br /><br />hired, she tries hard to please the devil in Prada,<br /><br />Miranda. Pleasing Miranda, however, is quite a challenge.<br /><br />Completely self centered, she makes impossible demands<br /><br />such as a flight out of Florida during a hurricane, or the<br /><br />unpublished manuscript to the latest Harry Potter book for<br /><br />her twins. Streep is the consummate bitch delivering such<br /><br />lines as:<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: Find me that piece of paper I had in my<br /><br />hand yesterday morning.<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: By all means move at a glacial pace. You<br /><br />know how that thrills me.<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: Details of your incompetence do not<br /><br />interest me.<br /><br />Contrast this Ice Queen with the laid back character she<br /><br />played in Prairie Home Companion, and you begin to get a<br /><br />sense of this actresses extensive range. This role earned<br /><br />her an Oscar nomination. Well deserved, I might add.<br /><br />First-assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) would be only too<br /><br />happy to sabotage Andy, but if she were fired just now<br /><br />that would dash her dreams of attending the fashion events<br /><br />in Paris. Lots of catty comments from her. My fav:<br /><br />Emily: Okay, I am hearing this...<br /><br />[She moves her hand in a speech mimiking sign]<br /><br />Emily: And I want to hear this.<br /><br />[She closes her hand]<br /><br />Can't wait to use that one.<br /><br />Art Director Nigel (Stanley Tucci) gives an excellent<br /><br />performance, mentoring the ingenue, without ever losing<br /><br />his satiric edge or giving in to the sacharine. Upon first<br /><br />seeing her he dashes off the following withering remark:<br /><br />Nigel: Who is that *sad* little person? Are we doing a<br /><br />before-and-after piece I don't know about?<br /><br />When she turns to him, after a particularly cruel session<br /><br />of torture from Miranda, instead of sympathy he tells her<br /><br />bluntly that she disrespects the Art of Fashion, the role<br /><br />of the magazine, and the impact of Miranda upon that Art.<br /><br />Nigel: Other girls dream of working here. You merely<br /><br />deign.<br /><br />Later, after seeing that Andy is smart and capable, and<br /><br />trying to meet the challenges of her job, he gives her a<br /><br />pair of Jimmy Chu high heels. She tells him they are not<br /><br />for her, but soon after when Miranda glares at her<br /><br />sensible shoes, she puts them on Tout de Suite. This is a<br /><br />turning point for her character, who finally gets in the<br /><br />game, embracing the world of fashion, and dances with the<br /><br />devil. Andy is now known as Andrea, and she finally gets<br /><br />some good barbs of her own, such as when sexy writer<br /><br />Christian Thompson (Simon Baker) attempts to seduce her in<br /><br />Paris:<br /><br />Christian Thompson: Je suis tr&egrave;s, tr&egrave;s d&eacute;sol&eacute;.<br /><br />Andy Sachs: You're not that d&eacute;sol&eacute; at all.<br /><br />Director David Frankel was also responsible for Sex in the<br /><br />City, and this film exhibits the same witty dialogue, the<br /><br />same heady mixture of comedy and drama, that will keep you<br /><br />entertained right up to the final d&eacute;nouement.</p></body></html>

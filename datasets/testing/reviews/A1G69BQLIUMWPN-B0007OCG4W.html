I loved the distrust and the plot that "what you have you don't want but as soon as you don't have it you want it"; as I think we are all victims of that life.  Granted most are not this distrustful.  But, if it was not happening around us do you think we would have talk shows and all these divorces if this movie was not close to reality.<br /><br />You see Alice/Jane (Portman)  walking in a crowd of people and Dan (Law) walking towards her Alice crosses the street and ends up getting hit by a car.  Dan takes her to the hospital and they fall in love.  Law must leave his girlfriend for Alice because she asks if he has a girlfriend and he says yes.  So then we flash forward and Dan is getting his picture taken by Anna (Roberts) and he is interested in her...They kiss and  this is the start of a romance between the two of them.  Alice sees that Dan has a "look" in his eyes when he comes to meet her downstairs of the apartment he was getting his picture taken in.  She then goes upstairs with her and listens in on the conversation that Dan and Anna have.  Anna tells him no she will not see him.  So Dan goes on websites that promote sex and uses Anna's name and tells people to meet her at the Aquarium.  Larry (Owen) shows up because of this and they end up falling in love and calling Dan "Cupid".  Anna has a picture of Alice at her show so they go and Dan begs Anna to be with him.  We flash again and you find that Larry and Anna are married and come to find out Larry cheats on Anna and Anna is cheating on him WITH DAN and that Dan was leaving Alice to get with Anna and she leaving Larry to be with Dan.  After Dan and Anna are together she goes back to Larry to get him to sign the divorce papers she gets him to only by sleeping with him.  Starting a new spiral now Dan is upset that Anna would cheat on him.  And Dan goes back to Larry who goes to Alice and starts another spiral.  You will have to watch the end to find out who ends up with who and who ends up alone.<br /><br />Over-all all the  waiting I had to do for this movie was worth it!  I also love the Daminen Rice song!</p></body></html>

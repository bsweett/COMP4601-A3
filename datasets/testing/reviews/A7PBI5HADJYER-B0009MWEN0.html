<meta name="summary" content="One of the best in sci-fi action."></head><body><p>Supremely entertaining sci-fi action film takes place in the future, where Earth lives in a basic fascist society, and is at war with giant insects from a distant planet.  It's up to Casper Van Dien and company to blow as many of them away as possible.  A hilarious "character" piece in the first half gives way to non-stop action and big, bloody battle scenes in the last hour, some of the best I've ever seen.  Silly, but also exciting, energetic, and just unbelievably entertaining this is director Paul Verhoeven at his best, with standout performances from Clancy Brown and Dina Meyer. Very enthusiastically recommended.<br />**** 1/2 out of *****</p></body></html>

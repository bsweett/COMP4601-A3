Fires On All Cylinders"></head><body><p>Though it's a bit tough to get to in one sitting (it's 172 minutes), Michael Mann's 1995 crime drama masterpiece "Heat" is ultimately one of the most satisfying film experiences one can enjoy. Starring two of the greatest actors in history (Al Pacino & Robert De Niro) sharing the screen together for the first time ever, backed by a great story and an equally fantastic supporting cast, "Heat" has been one of the last truly great movies to come out in the last 10 or so years, and it's truly a classic.<br /><br />Most reviewers have already gone into plot details, so I'll leave that this two disc special edition is the one to get. It's loaded with special features and has great picture and sound quality. A must-have.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jack Black Will Rock You at School ... with Joy and Laugh."></head><body><p>You may not like Jack Black -- he is always too noisy, and often too annoying.  And in "School of Rock" he never changes -- the same old JB, who hangs around in your room only with underwear, who doesn't pay his share of rent.  But "School of Rock" is a different thing.  He is still loud, OK, but this time that makes the film better than you expect.<p>Because you know this guy Dewey Finn played by Jack Black, after all, turns out a charming fellow among the likable kids.  JB's Dewey, in need of ready cash, disguises himself as a substitute teacher in a posh prep school (run by uptight principle Joan Cusack) and instead of math, he "teaches" the spirit of rock'n'roll to the children.  Of course, it won't take long before they enter the Battle of Bands, leading us to rousing finale.<p>You may not like Jack Black's character at first, but as the film goes on, he starts to show unexpected side to his personality.  The monetary motive turns into genuine passion, and that is no news in Hollywood, but it is rarely done with such an energetic and hilarious performance as that from the leading actor.<p>The kids not only can play the instruments, but also they can act, and many of them are given due moments to impress us.  Also great is Joan Cusack's comic acting, perhaps better than that of the sexually repressed fiancee in "In & Out."  Now her character here has something repressed deep inside -- which is again related to music.  Her turn (supported by a glass of beer in a bar) is simply wonderful.<p>The script by Mike White ("Chuck and Buck") who was JB's next-door neighbor knows how to extrect the better side of Jack Black's super-turbo comic turn. and though the story is not particularly unique, the result is a great success, especially when it shows the relations between the "teacher" and the students.  And director Richard Linklater ("Tape" and many others) does not show his trademark off-beat feelings -- his handling of the material is surprisingly traditional, and that also helps greatly.  <p>And most of all, this film is good-hearted, and is not afraid of showing that on its sleeve.  You can enjoy watching it with the good soundtrack, and when JB tries to teach the kids the riff of "Iron Man" and many 70s classic rock, you can feel his love of music.</p></body></html>

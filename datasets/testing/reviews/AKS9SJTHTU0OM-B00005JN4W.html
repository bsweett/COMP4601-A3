<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful, fun, smart family friendly animation"></head><body><p>While not quite up with the greatest of the Pixar films (Up, Wall-e,<br />Nemo, etc.) This is still smart, inventive and tremendous fun, with<br />some humanity thrown in to boot.<br /><br />For my money, more entertaining than any of the James Bond or superhero<br />films of recent vintage which it spoofs (and with more exciting action<br />besides!).<br /><br />In an alternate universe, Superheroes are told to stop being, well,<br />super, because of the risk of law suits and other problems. But some<br />just can't get the urge to fight crime out of their blood. Like Mr.<br />Incredible. He loves being a family man (a family who also all have<br />super powers) but a 9-5 job in an ugly, greedy corporate world is more<br />than he can take. So he quietly slips back into the super-hero biz, and<br />eventually drags the whole family in as well.<br /><br />All done with terrific animation, clever wordplay, great voice acting,<br />and a nice comment or two about the traps of trying to be 'normal'. It<br />gets all the balances right; humor to action to character to story.<br /><br />The blu-ray looks amazing, the extras are fun, and you don't<br />have to be a kid to love it (my wife and I watched with adult<br />friends - we all had a great time).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Awesome!"></head><body><p>This was a fabulous movie.  If you like the Comic book genre, this is one of the best out there.  Tony Stark was an awesome character.  Robert Downey Junior delivered the character incredibly.  I would definitely see it repeatedly, loved it.<br />But, it really is a shame if you missed the opportunity to see it on the big screen.  It is a great movie theater film.</p></body></html>

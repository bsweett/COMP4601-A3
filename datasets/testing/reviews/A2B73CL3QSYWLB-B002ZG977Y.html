Mythology used to put me to sleep in college with this god begetting this god and the nonesuch.  I was just looking for a good popcorn movie and for the most part this remake fit the bill.  Liam Neeson as Zeus is pretty much in paycheck mode and Ralph Fiennes chews the scenery as Hades.  The effects are pretty good and they service the story to a point.  Final verdict it has a good beat and I could dance to it so on a scale of one to ten I give it a six.</p></body></html>

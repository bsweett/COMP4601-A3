The "beginning of time" montage that starts the film is beautiful; roaming shots of the Icelandic countryside and angry waterfalls wash over you as the score tries to soothe you in a way that feels like it's trying to mislead you. It's as if it's trying to say, "There there, it'll be alright," and pats you softly on the hand like a caring grandmother before turning around in the next scene and growing to its peak as something horrific takes place on screen that wasn't expected mere moments ago.<br /><br />Everything is awe-inspiring to look at. One of the reasons for that is that Scott tried to use as little CGI in the film as possible (although there are over 1300 digital VFX shots) and mostly stuck to computer generated shots being used in space. If you're not blown away by the scenery, their exploration of the planet's surface and what that leads to, or the incredible shots in space, the technology they use in the film is beyond astounding; Reacting with holograms, 3D maps that can be accessed with the swipe of a finger, and an android capable of doing things some people only dream of is only scratching the surface.<br /><br />Where do we come from? Who are our makers? Will we still trust our faith when we find the answers? These are the questions "Prometheus" explores in its story. You also have a pretty great idea of just what the heck a Space Jockey is by the time "Prometheus" ends. The thing is that if you go into this expecting a straight shooting "Alien" prequel, you'll more than likely be disappointed. There are definitely nods to it and parts of the film play out similarly to "Alien," but this is more like taking place in the same universe as "Alien" and more of an indirect prequel. That quote Ridley Scott gave about this "having 'Alien' DNA," is extremely accurate.<br /><br />"Prometheus" isn't perfect. It may be really slow moving for some. It takes its sweet time establishing its atmosphere and you may be left wanting a bit more action. Patient viewers who can sit still and admire dialogue and a solid story will be rewarded while trigger happy viewers will more than likely get antsy. The ending, although somewhat satisfying, is mostly just this huge tease. If a sequel isn't made, we should probably riot; although, with repeat viewings, it's less of a problem.<br /><br />The biggest issue people may have is that technology seems so much more advanced in the past than in the future. "Prometheus" mostly takes place in 2093 while "Alien" takes place in 2122. You also have to keep in mind that the Prometheus is a more advanced ship than the Nostromo, a towing vessel; more of a grunt ship. So the argument could go either way.<br /><br />Repeat viewings also leave you with more questions. The main one being why did the atmosphere have such an altering affect on the ampule room yet didn't affect the cargo hold at all?<br /><br />"Prometheus" is really freaking superb on one hand. Its cast is ridiculous and every one of them delivers, the visuals are fantastic, and the storyline is mostly incredibly enthralling. Imagine being a film critic who's used to taking notes throughout the duration of a film, but during "Prometheus" you were so absorbed in it that you didn't write anything down other than the title. That's kind of a big deal.<br /><br />On the other hand, something more definitive seems like it would have been more gratifying. With stakes so high that define what we, as humans, actually are, an open ending leaving room for a sequel feels like a bit of a cop out. "Prometheus" is still spectacular and mesmerizing. Ridley Scott is back in top form, but "Prometheus" suffers from pulling (and relying on) the strings of anticipation a bit too much.</p></body></html>

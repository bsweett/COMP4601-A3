The first thing that comes to mind is the apartheid that hamstrung the country it takes place in, for so many years. It was disheartening to see it resurrected once more, not for the Blacks, but the aliens (which is in itself curious, because there are blacks in the film treating the aliens as they were once treated).<br />The aliens themselves seemed like animals at times, and being human, we tend to "lessen" them because of this. Of course, their societal norms are very different from ours, and because of this, they tend to be a bit shall we say....Destructive? So they are segregated.<br />You are immediately immersed in the film from the very start, because of the "Live news coverage" nature of the film. The "live roving camera" style isn't as bad as far as motion sickness goes, and the violence is VERY convincing. The aliens (or "Prawns" as they are derisively called) for being CGI, are, as well. So much so, that one would probably not bat an eye if they actually showed up in "person"!<br />The secretive and subversive nature of the MNU (or "MultiNational Union") is also convincing, because so many nations already do these sorts of things, already. It's henchman soldiers hark back to the French Foreign Legion, because they operate in much the same way as the FFL did, in it's heyday.<br />I found the film touching, in some respects, because the Human protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe, Only found his humanity, when it was finally lost, and the alien protagonist, "Christopher Johnson", found that not all humans are evil, but just "misguided".<br />Peter Jackson hit a homer with "District 9". He also left considerable room for sequels, as well, which is good, because I would very much like to see some threads resolved.<br /><br />I recommend "district 9" not for it's SFX, or it's acting, action, or camera work. It is recommended because it leaves you thinking long after the credits (because my assessment here, is not the only conclusion you may be left with). easily 5 stars!</p></body></html>

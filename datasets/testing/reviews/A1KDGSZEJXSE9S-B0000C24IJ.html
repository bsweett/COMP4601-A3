<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Pathetic"></head><body><p>I was hyped for this flick because I like Deliverance.<br />After I seen this movie I realized Wrong Turn wasn't<br />much like it at all. Deliverance was about 4 city boys<br />going to the woods and two of them getting mentally<br />tortured and having to coverup the murders of the two<br />hicks they killed. This movie is a Texas Chainsaw Mass-<br />acre rip-off. It's just a stop and go gore fest with<br />lame looking hick folk. Come on! These guys don't even<br />look human! They look like some monster trolls or some<br />thing like that.<br /><br />It's just boring and uninteresting. There was one scene<br />that I really liked with an axe and a tree. Don't want<br />to give it all away. Other than that, the movie was just<br />a bore. I expected more from a movie that was supposed<br />to be out of the Deliverance mold.</p></body></html>

This, however, is not the case. Or, it is at least half the case, to put it nicely.<br /><br />The film is only one hour and a half long.<br /><br />The first thirty minutes, to me, is wasted in a montage of sex, drugs, booze, and little, if none, rock and roll. It didn't surprise me seeing as how Eli Roth clearly explained that, for some reason, he must use nudity in his films in order to capture the essence of the 80's nostolgia that got lost in the undertow of the movies of the ninties. However, we are now in the millenium which means: New Direction.<br /><br />But, on a more positive note, I did like the way the film slowly crept into the dark depths of fear. There are a lot of serial killer movies, supernatural killers, jason, michael myers, flesh-eating bacteria, fear of the unkown, fear of the water, hieghts, or an alien threat. But very few, almost none, do not focus on the fear of being in a room where some stranger gets to torcher you however he or she wants or pleases. So, becuase this is the first movie that hones in on that fear, I have to give the director credit becuase he did what he wanted to achieve; he made me squirm.<br /><br />Now, after watching it once, I was totally disoriented. But the second time around I began to find myself very sympathetic to the three backpackers who were in this feature. It seems as if they were destined to do dumb stuff right before they witnessed the horror of torture.<br /><br />There is even signature lighting and tone that really reveals that this was done by the same people who did the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake.<br /><br />In essence, it's an original premise but, for me, it just needed to get there quicker. Could have done without the gratuitus sex scenes and drug hoopla.<br /><br />This movie, in a way, shows you how sick and twisted strangers are when they get bored with there hum-drum lives.<br /><br />Also, to the horror-nuts out there; you should know that there is not much gore in this feature. If I could compare it, I'd say that it was a little more than what the movie SAW brought to the screen.<br /><br />But, another thing I've found is that this is way better than CABIN FEVER.<br /><br />But, when you think about it, Hostel really breaks into two different acts. The first act of the movie depicts the Hostel (a modern day soddom and gomorah) that the three backpackers are staying at. The second act shows how Hostel (meaning crazy) the villianous characters can be.<br /><br />I think, if anything, this movie will surprise you but it is not for the faint of heart.</p></body></html>

They were: (1) Dr. No (1962) (2) From Russia with Love (1963) (3) Goldfinger (1964) (4) Thunderball (1965) (5) You Only Live Twice (1967) and (6) Diamonds are Forever (1971).<br /><br />As you can see from the above list, "Goldfinger" is the third spy film of the British Bond series.  As well, it is the third to star Connery as the fictional MI6 agent Commander James Bond (code number 007).<br /><br />This movie is based on the 1959 novel "Goldfinger" by Ian Fleming (1908 to 1964).<br /><br />The story has Bond following gold smuggler Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe whose voice was dubbed) who plans a nuclear detonation inside the Fort Knox gold depository thus making the gold supply radioactive for 58 years.  This would cause economic chaos in the West and increase the value of Goldfinger's non-radioactive gold (that he has stashed away) many times.<br /><br />(Look at Goldfinger's first name "Auric" closely.  The word gold comes from the Latin word "aurum."  "Au" is the chemical symbol for gold.)<br /><br />This was the first Bond movie to use a pop singer (Shirley Bassey) to sing the theme song during the titles.  The lyrics of the title song were co-written by Anthony Newley.  Bassey would go on to sing the theme song in two other Bond movies.<br /><br />Several memorable scenes frequent this movie such as:<br /><br />(1) the dead woman painted in gold<br />(2) Goldfinger's Korean mute manservant named Oddjob (Olympic silver medalist weight lifter Harold Sakata) who uses his Bowler hat as a lethal frizbee<br />(3) Goldfinger attempting to slice Bond in half with a laser<br />(4) the modified Aston Martin DB5 car that has a host of gadgets such as a handy passenger ejector seat<br />(5) the movie's double climatic ending<br /><br />Another thing memorable about this movie is its witty dialogue.  For example, take the scene where Bond is tied spread-eagled to a slab of gold with a laser beam slowly inching up between his legs threatening to cut him in half:<br /><br />Bond: "Do you expect me to talk?"<br />Goldfinger: "No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to die!!"<br /><br />Connery brings his characteristic savoir fare to the role.  Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore (Goldfinger's personal pilot) does a good job as an independent and strong Bond girl.  Gert Frobe gives an excellent performance as Goldfinger.  (I found it odd that in the beginning and end credits that Blackman is given first billing over Frobe who plays the title character.)<br /><br />M, Q, Miss Moneypenny, and Felix all appear in this movie.<br /><br />Filming was primarily in Switzerland, Miami, and London, England.<br /><br />Some trivia: Burt Kwouk has a small part in this movie.  He became famous for playing "Kato" in the Pink Panther series starring Peter Sellers.<br /><br />Total box office for this movie was about one-hundred and twenty-five million dollars.  In today's dollars, that's about eight-hundred and seventy million making this movie the first official Bond blockbuster.<br /><br />The DVD (the one released in Feb., 2007) is flawless in picture and sound quality.  The picture has been digitally restored and I'm sure the picture is just as good (if not better!!) than when it was released almost 45 years ago.  As well, there is one extra in the form of an audio commentary.<br /><br />Finally, here is some information to consider.  This DVD is actually the first disc of the two-disc "Ultimate Edition."  Bond enthusiasts might want to purchase this two-disc Ultimate Edition since the second disc has "the best collection of special features ever assembled for Bond."  (Unfortunately, the Ultimate Edition is no longer available but it can be purchased second-hand.)<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is the first official Bond blockbuster thus making it a must-see!!!<br /><br />(1964;  1 hr, 50 min;  wide screen;  32 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny, trashy comedy, nothing more"></head><body><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XEW">The Hangover</a> is another puerile comedy - nothing more, nothing less. It's certainly better than most comedies out there today. I'd give it 3.5-4 stars overall. It is funny and has some classic moments - tiger in the bathroom, the Holocaust ring, etc. Zach Galifianakis was particularly hilarious ("I didn't know they gave rings out at the Holocaust"). It also has a decent plot, as the trio attempts to find one of their missing wingmen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XEW">The Hangover</a> feels more like a bunch of intermittent funny jokes, rather than one hilarious rout. It's funny, but not bed-wetting or tear-inducing funny. Certainly not another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A02TZ">National Lampoon's Animal House (Widescreen Double Secret Probation Edition)</a>.<br /><br />At the end of the day, if you like movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JM1F">Old School (Widescreen Unrated Edition)</a>, you'll probably love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XEW">The Hangover</a>. If you don't, then you won't like this movie.</p></body></html>

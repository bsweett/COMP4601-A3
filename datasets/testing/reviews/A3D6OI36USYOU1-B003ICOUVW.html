But<br />the Blu Ray, as pretty as it is, reveals way too much CGI for this thing to be enjoyable.<br />Del Toro makes a reasonable showing as the haunted Lawrence Talbot, and the twist supplied<br />by Anthony Hopkins makes this thing watchable. The showdown at the end of the movie makes<br />this worth the time, but in the end it feels like this was just another wasted opportunity.<br /><br />The original had atmosphere too, more suspense, phenomenal effects, and no CGI. If you haven't<br />seen it, the new Special Edition Universal release does justice to the legend.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="From a life of let-downs to a life of Presidency"></head><body><p>Oliver Stone directed-movies are usually on the kooky side, but this one is not filled with so much archive footage this time.<br />  Oliver Stone was able to get an all-star cast for this film.<br />  Josh Brolin portrays "George W. Bush".<br /> Bush soon to have a father who will become the Vice President of the United States and eventually The President of the United States, just got himself into some trouble after a football game. He calls his father, George H. W. Bush (James Cromwell) to help him out of jail. Congressman George Bush already has his hands full with Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Doro. "Poppy" will help him this one last time. George must be one honky-tonk, hell-raiser of a young man.<br />  As the movie jumps around to George W. as President of the United States to flashbacks of his young adult life, we see Bush has had it up to here with an oil rig job. An intense, dirty job I am sure he was all too proud to get fired from.<br />  Destiny would prevail.<br />  In 1977, George W. decides he wants to run for Congress in Texas. Later that year<br />at a barbecue, he meets the lady of his life, Laura Welch (Elizabeth Banks).<br />  He loses the election.<br />  Four years later, he marries Laura.<br />  After turning 40 in 1986, he gave up alcohol and decides to help his father, who has been Vice President since 1981, campaign for Presidency.<br />  He wins the election, but only becomes a one-term President as he loses the re-election in 1992.<br />  It is at this point that George W. decides to change his entire life around with Laura by his side.  He wants to run for Governor of Texas.  His father and mother, Barbara (Ellen Burstyn), disapprove as they want to concentrate on Jeb who is running for Governor of Florida.  George tells his son, "one Bush at a time".<br />  George W. decides to start a campaign anyway.<br />  Both Jeb and George won their office.<br />  This all leads to George W's historical bid for Presidency in 2000.<br /><br />  Josh Brolin in some scenes really nails the mannerisms and voice of George W. Bush. If you were to look away from the screen, you might think you were listening to the real person.<br />  I did not know that was Thandie Newton as "Condoleezza Rice" until I saw the end credits. What a transformation.<br />  Stacy Keach as "Rev. Earle Hudd" blew me away with his performanace. I have never seen him in such a role before.<br />  Richard Dreyfuss is a scene stealer as well as Jeffrey Wright.<br />  Jeffrey Wright was fun to watch as "Powell". I have liked Jeffrey Wright in several films, including his role as "Felix Leiter" in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MRA5NS">Casino Royale [Blu-ray</a>] (2006) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPLIEG">Quantum of Solace</a> (2008).<br />  Ellen Burstyn is always stunning in every performance I have seen her in.<br />  I thought James Cromwell was miscast as "George H.W. Bush", but did capture the emotions in some scenes.<br />  I did not recognize Scott Glenn as "Rumsfeld".<br /><br />Also in the cast: Bruce McGill, Colin Hanks, Jason Ritter, Noah Wyle, Ioan Gruffudd.<br /><br />  Note: Had some problems with the DVD loading. It can start the film automatically, but you might get a black screen. Just press your remote button to get it to play. When you see the Lionsgate tradmark wheels, you are fine.<br /><br />  Special Feature included.<br /><br />  Not the best film I have seen that included the portrayal of George W. Bush. May I suggest the tv-movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6AJI">DC 9/11 - Time of Crisis</a>, with Timothy Bottoms. as "President George W. Bush".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Get Off My Lawn!!" Another Terrific Performance, Both In Front & Behind The Camera, For The Man With No Name."></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood's latest film is one of his best ever, as he directs and stars in an updated "Unforgiven"-style drama. The acting is well-done, from Eastwood himself to the other actors. SPOILER!!! The final confrontation scene, while sad, is intense, and at the same time, the only appropriate way for the story to go. SPOILER OVER!!! See it. It's so worth it. Rated R for language.</p></body></html>

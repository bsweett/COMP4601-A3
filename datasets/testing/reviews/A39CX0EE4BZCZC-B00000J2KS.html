They all think this is a very sick, shocking and just plain revolting movie. Hey, I understand that. When this film was released almost four decades ago, it was highly controversial. Even though nudity is nothing new in films today, I suspect this story still shocks a lot of people. It isn't just the nudity but the carefree-sadistic attitude of the main character that is repulsive to many.<br /><br />The vocabulary and the creepiness of lead actor Malcolm McDowell's character "Alexander de Large" is like nothing I have ever heard and seen on film. I play the DVD now with the subtitles on to understand all the strange words and expressions McDowell uses as he narrates this story. That dialog, too, is still unique and probably always will be.<br /><br />A big attraction for me or the wild visuals. The outrageous colors in here from the clothing McDowell and his gang wore, to the futuristic house interiors and sets, are still something to see! I think this is director Stanley Kubrick's best work, cinematography-wise, which is why - when I saw the first 10 minutes on Blu-Ray at a store, I was disappointed it wasn't that sharp.<br /><br />Yes, the violence is shocking but that sets up the main storyline: dealing with that kind of mentality (a sick thug with no apparent conscience). What ensues in the story is almost as disturbing - and thought-provoking.  After "Alex" is captured, he is a part of new experiment to cure violent and overly sexual tendencies. The scenes of his "rehabililation" aren't always easy to watch. He then returns to the street and is almost killed by his former victims who "accidently" run into him. Things get so bad Alex" tries to kill himself, so the media gives him a big splash and they de-program him back to his normal sick self and the movie ends abruptly with Alex a happy man again. How twisted is that?? A rapist homicidal maniac is set free and the government is made to look stupid? Well, since this comes from Kubrick, that's not surprising. But, this film probably was interpreted in numerous ways and was an interesting discussion-starter.<br /><br />In summary, a perverted story but the one-of-a-kind lead character, famous visuals and sets and interesting message always make this film watchable, but be warned: this is a brutal and often uncomfortable movie to watch.</p></body></html>

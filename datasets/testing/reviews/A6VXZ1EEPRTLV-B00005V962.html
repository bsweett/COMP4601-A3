<meta name="summary" content="Slick and clinical caper..."></head><body><p>When the high cost of top draw actor's salaries limits the number of big stars, any one movie can have, it's nice to see that the "remake" of Ocean's Eleven does succeed in gathering together a cast of some rather highly paid actors.  The "all star cast" includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, and Julia Roberts.  The second tier group of actors includes Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Hollywood veterans, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner.  With such heavyweight talent, and a setting in Las Vegas, one might expect spectacular results, but they never quite materialize.  Director Steven Soderberg's production is a slick, and well-structured, yet superficial and lacking in passion and emotion.  The tale is well told, but never aims for, or touches the heart.  <p>Low key, analytical, and in control, George Clooney, is Danny Ocean, the man with an audacious plan to rob the vault of the Bellagio casino.  Andy Garcia is Terry Benedict, the owner of the Bellagio, who's current love is Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts).  Ocean's team is headed by Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), who does most of the recruiting, and oversees the elaborate operation.  <p>Lack of passion?  Well, we don't really hate Benedict, the intended victim, who just comes off of as ultra competent.  Andy Garcia, plays his character as very straight and reserved.  Clooney, while a good actor, is not the ideal choice as a fiery romantic lead.  Julia Roberts is the lone female, and her performance is also subdued, rather than stunning.  What emotion there is, is mostly present in undertones.<p>The other performances are solid, but there just isn't any special chemistry to be found between any of them.  Pitt is steady, not flashy.  Don Cheadle's character "Basher" an electronics expert, uses unfamiliar English slang, to perhaps impart "authenticity", but it's more of a distraction ("naused?").  Some performances do sneak up on you.  Carl Reiner, is wonderful, and scores big time, playing a rich tycoon to perfection.  And versatile Matt Damon, is the "kid" forced into a primary role, in the biggest job of his life.  Just a tip, no more shots of Elliot Gould with his shirt open,<p>If you are satisfied with just a smoothly-executed, and rewarding heist, then give this a chance.  There's not much suspense or humor however, and character development is minimal.  The focus is on the task at hand.  The music, adds to its slick feeling, keeping things light and flowing.  Oscar winning director Soderberg draws top stars to his projects, and making a lightweight "fun" picture is certainly no crime.</p></body></html>

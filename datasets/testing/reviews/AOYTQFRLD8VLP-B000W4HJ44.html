Despite her run-down surroundings, she is filled with infectious optimism as she expresses her desire to appear  on the "Corny Collins ( James Marsden) Show", a dance program for teens. It is a good morning in her 1962 Baltimore indeed!<br /> She endures strife from her teacher Miss Wimsey (Jayne Eastwood, who appeared with co-star, Queen Latifah in 2002's "Chicago") for everything from the size of her fashionable bouffant ( which isn't that high) to tardiness, and enjoys the company of her lollipop-sucking best friend, Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes), the child of an incarcerated  father and an overly religious mother, Prudy ( Allison Janney); Penny believes<br /> in Tracey and is content to follow her lead. In turn, she gradually develops her own self assertiveness despite her mother's constraints on her life.<br /> Among the so-called "Nicest Kids in Town"--the Council members on Tracy's favorite program, are lead singer, Link Larkin (Zac Efron), and Elvis wanna-be, and his not-so-nice Amber Von Tussle(Brittny Snow), the daughter of WYTZ's station manager, Velma Von Tussle( Michelle Pfeiffer).The latter torments Tracy in school as well, and we see how the expression "Like mother, like daughter" applies as both bully co-workers and Council members into giving Amber, who, at best, is a mediocre dancer, the lion's share of the spotlight, and relegating<br />R&B dic jockey Motormouth Maybelle( Queen Latifah) and the African American dancers only to appearances on the show's "Negro Day", the last Tuesday of every month.<br /> Periodic musical song-and dance man, Christopher Walken plays Tracy's  father, Wilber, who encourages her ambitions, whereas her mother, Edna (John Travolta, continuing the tradition of playing Mrs. Turnblad as a man in drag, but still showing those trademark dance moves), an introverted laundress, takes the opposite stance.<br />  When Council Member Brenda(Casie Silver) gets in the family way,and must take a leave of absence from the show, Tracy skips morning classes (accompanied by Penny)to audition for the opening. Despite her aptitude with the dance moves, Velma rejects her because of her girth and support of desegregation, despite Corny's approval of her views. Tardiness results in her being placed in detention, where she is exposed to new dance moves by Maybelle' son,Seaweed (Elijah Kelly), who, along with other Negro Day dancers, practice their moves in detention hall because those in power have no interest in educating them. A subsequent encounter with Link makes Tracy envision a future with him. In the meantime, her newly-acquired dance moves win her a cherished place on the show when she displays them at a record hop hosted by Corny.<br /> Conflict between Velma and Maybelle aries when Negro Day performers, the Dynamites perform the same song as the white Council members, despite the fact the the Dynamites wrote it. Velma decides to cancel Negro Day.<br /> A plus-sized women's clothing saleman, Mr. Pinky ( Jerry Stiller) offers Tracy a job as his spokesgirl, and Tracy urges her reluctant mother to come out of her shell and be her agent.<br /> The Von Tusselle's become more malicious as Tracy's poularity increases and she provs to be a contender for the title of Miss Teenage Hairspray, and for Link's heart. Amber anonymously reports Tracy's trip to Maybelle's recordshop platter party. When Edna goes to collect her dsughter, the equally hefty Maybelle  inspires Edna to adopt a more positive self-image.<br /> In the meantime, Velma tries to seduce Wilbur as he works in his joke shop, attempting to make Edna angry enough to withdraw Tracy from the show. Edna catches them together and is devastated, but it is soon established that Wilbur did not submit to Velma's advances, and the couple gradually make up. In their song, "You're Timeless to Me", an attentive listener can her starins of "La Vie en Rose" near the end.<br /> In an attempt to reinstate Negro Day, Maybelle, Seaweed, and the other black dancers, decide to march of the station, and at great risk, Tracy joins them. The high solemnity of this scene is encapsulated in Maybelle's soulful ballad, "I Know Where I've Been" , whose lyrics, "There's a road we've been traveling . Lost so many on the way. But the riches will be plenty--worth the price we had to pay.." have a certain power and profundity deeply felt in 2009.<br />  A confrontation with a police blockade results in the arrests of the demonstrators, and Tracy's flight to Penny's house. Prudy punishes Penny for hiding Tracy in their fall-out shelter. But Seaweed and his friends, bailed out by Wilbur, help the girl's escape  and Seaweed and Penny reveal their mutual feelings for each other.<br /> Link acknowledges his feelings for Tracy at the Turnblad's house.<br /> Once safe, Tracy calls home to establish a plan of action, resulting in a spectacular finale at the Miss Teenage Hairspray Pageant, during which Maybelle's daughter, Inez (Taylor Parks), steals the show.<br /> Paul Dooley plays Mr. Spritzer, the owner of the Ultra Clutch Hairspray company, who initially denounces Tracy's desegregationist views as Communistic, but find her to be great for capitalism when she boosts his sales.Ricki Lake, the orginal Tracy Turnblad, cameos as a talent agent, Marissa Jaret Winokur, who orginated the role on Broad way sings at the end, proving this film to be fraught with nostaligia in more ways than one.<br /> Viewers will be treated to a musical as brave and triumpahnt as its plump heroine, and a good time should be had by all!</p></body></html>

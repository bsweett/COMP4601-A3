It stars Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo & Julie Benz as Sarah the story is short & sweet Rambo takes these relief workers over to Burma but they were captured by the Burmaneese army. Stallone of course directed this & all as I have to say is that he really knows his audience & knows how to get the audience to hate the villain. So this precher or something tells Rambo that these people have been captured so Rambo teams up with some Merc's & they kind of remind me of the guys from the 1st Predator movie they were entertaining. I thought that Julie Benz was a decent lead girl & this was by far my favorite perfomance of Sylvester Stallone as the Rambo chracter. He kills a bunch of mother f*****s there's a video on youtube that has Stallone's kill count. Brian Tyler did a good job with the score. It used very little CGI as well it had a decent story that really drove the action. Of course Stallone did a good job with the directing which he has directed a lot of his own movies in the past I really think he understands his audience more than Jean Claude Van Dammme. So I'am looking forward to the Expendables this summer also directed by Stalllone if you love old school 80's action movies then you'll more than likely like Rambo IV. Now I'm going to talk about The Extended Edition It has all the deleted scenes added back in with some alternate takes. There are more scenes with Rambo & Sarah. The opening is John Rambo. During the opening 2 guys on the boat are playing with the cobra. Also added back in while Rambo is working in the hut Sarah asks him to take them to Burma again. Added dialog at the night scene where it's raining Sarah asks him to take them again. When Rambo is taking the Rrlief Workers up river there is a longer conversation with Rambo & Sarah we learn Sarah is a 6th grade school teacher & her & Michael are engaged. Also after Rambo kills the pirates different dialog is spoken Michael tells Sarah will come back next year. More lines are added when Sarah begs him not too. The part where Rambo sets the boat on fire there are flashbacks to what happend earlier. Added scene where Rambo is thinking about what Sarah said about going back to The States. Added scene where the guy from The Church prays for the captured Relief Workers. The scene where Rambo bandages Sarah's foot that was wounded added back in. It's a good cut of the film but both versions are the same for me. But you should get definitely for the documentary which is very good. Rambo IV  I really think it beats a lot of so called action movies in the past 5 or 6 years.</p></body></html>

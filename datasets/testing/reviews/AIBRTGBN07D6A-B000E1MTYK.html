<meta name="summary" content="Above average for the Harry Potter series"></head><body><p>ON THE FILM:<br />As a fan of all the previous Harry Potter films, and having read all of the books, I was really looking forward to "Goblet of Fire," especially since it was my favorite book as well. That may be why I was so disappointed after actually seeing it. The main problem with "Goblet of Fire," is that Director Mike Newell tried to condense way too much into a two hour movie. I know this has been a criticism of the previous films, but I have never agreed with it until now. There is no way to include everything from the books into the films, and in most cases the cuts in previous films have been just. However in this case, the book was way too long for a two hour movie.<br /><br />Noticeably absent are the relationships between Hermione and Ron, Harry and Cho, and Harry and Draco. Harry and Draco are enemies, and their rivalry has always played a very large role in the books, especially given Draco's actions in future books. His character had roughly 60 seconds of screen time in this film and a handful of lines. His scenes could have been cut out completely and it wouldn't have changed the movie much from the way it turned out. Professor Snape was given a similar treatment. Newell tried to display jealousy between Ron and Hermione, but it failed miserably as they did not have development for the audience to believe in it. The character of Rita Skeeter was introduced as a nosy reporter, however she added absolutely nothing to the movie and is another character that is very prominent in the book, but could have been completely cut out of this film and it would not have made a difference.<br /><br />The majority of the movie focused on the Tri-Wizard tournament, which was very well done, but was not the focus of the book and made for a film that kids would probably love, but does not do justice for the adult viewer who wants to see more character development. The final task of the tournament, the maze, was not adequately explained at all. In the book, the maze brings out the worst fears in someone and turns them against themseves. In the movie, it was condensed to just being a creepy maze that attacked you with roots.<br /><br />My other biggest problem was with the casting, specifically Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Stanislav Ianevski as Viktor Krum. I've heard the complaints of Gambon not living up to the precedent set in previous films by Richard Harris, and never believed it until now. He comes off completely out of character from the Dumbledore in the book. He is gruff and abrasive in this film, at one point grabbing Harry and shaking him violently. Where is the wise and compassionate, yet still powerful, Dumbledore from the books? Ianevski looks good on the posters, but his acting seems too unseasoned for a role this big. Cedric Diggory and Fleur Delacour are very well casted however.<br /><br />Edit 5 January 2012 - Having seen all of the films in the franchise now, I actually appreciate this movie a lot more and think it is one of the better ones in the series. I still think it should have been cut into two films and feels condensed, but the tri-wizard tournament is one of the more climatic events during all of the movies and is very well done.</p></body></html>

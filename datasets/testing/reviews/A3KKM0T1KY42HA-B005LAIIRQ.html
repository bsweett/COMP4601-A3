<meta name="summary" content="Dances With Wolves"></head><body><p>When did Liam Neeson become such a bad-aze? Was it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CRM6QE">Darkman</a> perhaps? Maybe he always was, but he's such an under the radar bad-aze, no?<br /><br />The Grey is an action/drama about a pack of roughnecks versus a pack of wolves in the frozen tundra. If you can believe that about 7 or 8 oil riggers survive a pretty violent plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness, and if you can believe that a pack of wolves immediately locates and starts hunting the oil riggers with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAT">Jurassic Park</a> velociraptor cunningness...AND if you can believe that the pack of oil riggers never consider using any of the club-like shrapnel and debris from the crash as weapons against the wolves...then you'll thoroughly enjoy The Grey.<br /><br />Not that I didn't enjoy The Grey as it was rolling across my screen. It's just that in hindsight, it was a little unbelievable that this group of people--complete with the clich&eacute; alpha-male (Neeson), the jerk who won't cooperate with anyone, the nice guy, the father figure, the rational guy, the annoying dummy and a couple of other dudes who right from the start you say, "Oh you know he dead"--could survive an explosive plane crash and subzero temperatures with blowing wind and snow for even 5 minutes.<br /><br />But all in all, The Grey is worth a rent or cable view and should keep you entertained for the approximate 2 hour run time.</p></body></html>

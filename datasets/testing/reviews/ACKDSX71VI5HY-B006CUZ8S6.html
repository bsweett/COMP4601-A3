<meta name="summary" content=""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"  is a superior sequel"></head><body><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", the 2002 follow-up to "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone" works better in every way than its predecessor.  A deeper story which introduces extremely compelling characters and storylines, this movie really begins the push toward maturity that defines the series' overall trajectory.<br /><br />Here, Harry begins to see the cracks in Hogwarts' supposed status as a safe haven, and learns even more about his nemesis Lord Voldemort.  The character is given a brilliant human backstory through the discovery of a magical diary which mysteriously leads Harry on a quest to do battle with(SPOILER)the malevolent memory of Voldemort's human self.<br /><br />Returning actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint must carry an even meatier story on this second film, and their performances grow as surely as themselves.  Each actor is able to convey a wide range of emotions, but it's Radcliffe who truly owns Harry Potter with his performance here.  He brings a self-assurance and talent to the role worthy of actors two and three times his age.  In the final performance of his life, Richard Harris is subdued yet gently authoritative as Albus Dumbledore.  Dame Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are standouts as Professors McGonagall and Snape, respectively.  Series newcomers Kenneth Branagh, Toby Jones, and Jason Isaacs all give terrific performances.  These three actors especially add the creative flavor the first movie misses.  Their characters Gilderoy Lockhart, Dobby, and Lucious Malfoy, Draco's hateful father, give the series more themes to address.  Mr. Issacs in particular is superbly cold.<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is a promising second chapter in arguably the most creative fantasy movie series of all time.</p></body></html>

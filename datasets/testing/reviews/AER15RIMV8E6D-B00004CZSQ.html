<meta name="summary" content="Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA!!!"></head><body><p>It started off pretty good and creepy, but there were some parts that were kinda boring. There were some awesome beautiful scenes of bright beautiful red, green, and blue colors! I love the dark and rainy night and showing all the colors! Suzy goes to a fancy ballet school and some strange things start happening like people disappearing, dogs eating their owners, maggots in all the rooms, and the supernatural witches hanging around!!!! If you like Dario Argento and Italian horror, you might like SUSPIRIA!!!</p></body></html>

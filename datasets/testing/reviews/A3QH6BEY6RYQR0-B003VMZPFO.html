<meta name="summary" content="Exciting, scary stuff"></head><body><p>A small town in Iowa sees some of its residents acting strange and committing violent acts. The local sheriff discovers a downed plane in a nearby river, and suspects that the town's water supply may have been contaminated, but by what? The terror spreads, and the remaining sane inhabitants are left to fend for themselves against not only the sickened residents, but the military personnel who are in town to "clean things up." The film has a lot of good scares, and is violent, but not unnecessarily so. The tension throughout keeps the viewer engrossed, and at times, unsure of whom is "sick", and who is not. The Crazies contains some good scares and is a lot of fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ROB TAKES US AGAIN INTO HELL!!!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>I just got done renting The Devil's Rejects and let me say that Rob likes taking us viewers into hell!!!!!! I liked that it was more real then putting in digial effects and the story was awesome too!!!!!!!! Baby, Captain Saudling, and Otis are back again and this time they are on the run from the police!!!!!! Needless to say the police officer that is after them had his brother killed from them and he is determined to catch and kill each one of them!!!!!!!!! If you have not seen the first one which is House of 1000 Corpses then watch that one and then go watch this and all the cast did a great job and it is sad to see the talented Matthew McGory pass away and this is his final performance,but i thought that it was touching that on the bonus stuff they pay tribute to him!!!!!!! GO OUT AND RENT THIS HORROR/THRILLER YOU WILL LIKE IT TOO!!!!!</p></body></html>

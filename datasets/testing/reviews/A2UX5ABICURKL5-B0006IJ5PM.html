<meta name="summary" content="I Remember Those Nights!!"></head><body><p>This is a great movie, cause it deals with a football team I never got to play.<br />But they were our ticket to state, we were not good enough to get to them<br />in the playoffs or it maybe we were good enough, but we just didn't try hard enough.<br />Out where these people live these people live for football.<br />I remember back in the 90's these 2 teams were in the news alot.<br />A must see, I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></body></html>

While it is by far the most disturbing film of 2000, this movie is thought provoking, intelligent, true-to-life and utterly convincing. I can promise you right now this is a movie you&#65533;re not going to forget in a while and a movie that is unlike any other drug movie ever put to the silver screen. Requiem for a Dream is so graphic with its violence, adult themes, drug taking and sex it may become a little too much for some people. I was frankly almost sick. So if you&#65533;re a faint-hearted person I recommend skipping this movie and maybe seeing the equally good The Basketball Diaries. Okay, back to the film. It is one of the best movies of 2000 and has a unique power. As soon as this movie was over I just wanted to go back and see it again. It&#65533;s official &#65533; this is the first movie in history than really properly portrays how heroin and speed and every other drug can dislocate us from ourselves. This movie has been classified as drama but it is really a horror film. It is so realistic, true-to-life and graphic about drugs and how they effect our lives that I was utterly terrified. I will never ever take drugs after seeing Requiem for a Dream and if I ever feel the need to I&#65533;ll watch the movie and forget all about it. The performances in this movie are absolutely breathtaking. Marlon Wayans is a star and Jennifer Connelly is shocking and great as a girl who will do anything to get something to smoke. Jared Leto is unequally fantastic and by far the best young actor in this gripping movie. However, it is not a surprise that Ellen Burstyn gives the best performance. She is truly terrifying, believable and masterful as Sarah, who is using a dangerous diet and just wants to be on television. This movie has many memorable and terrifying scenes but I will not ruin it for you. All in all, Requiem for a Dream is a master-work of absolute terror, drama and drugs, a haunting film that will make you think twice about ever looking at another dangerous substance. <p>NOTE: Requiem for a Dream: Drector's Cut that is even more disturbing and graphic than the cut version. Director's Cut is even better than the movie itself and has alot of good features and new scenes. I highly recommend people who enjoyed the movie to buy the Director's Cut version.</p></body></html>

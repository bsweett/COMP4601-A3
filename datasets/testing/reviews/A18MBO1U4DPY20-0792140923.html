<meta name="summary" content="BRILLIANT"></head><body><p>I've written over two hundred reviews, I never wrote one for this film. I thought I wouldn't do it justice. I gave it my fourth watch and well, to say I'm gutted would be an understatement. Have I ever loved a movie character as much as that of Forrest Gump? No.<br /><br />Silence has been used well, the silence in the eyes of Forrest Gump. There's something rather powerful about his expressionless face. It can emote comedy, unconventional charisma but above all, a deep sense of sadness. I know this a rather bold statement that would raise a lot of argument but just for the sake of Forrest Gump and my love for this film, I can safely be abrasive and say Tom Hanks gave the best performance for a male ever in a lead role.<br /><br />I do not know whether I should commend the direction, or the screenplay, or the background music and screenplay because all I remember of when I think of this film, is Tom Hanks and that look on his face.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is special. In a wierd way,I would like to think every movie watcher relates to this story. It also manages to nail all emotions. When I watched this film for the first time, I thought about it for a week. With every new person, I meet in my daily life, or date, there always is a conversation about forrest gump. And I like mentioning to them how I lock my doors while watching this film because I wouldnt want anybody rushing to see me.<br /><br />The awkwardness in his actions, is similar to that of the character Edward (played by Depp) in a film called Edward Scissorhands. The humor is compareable to the great Stan Laurel. The way he cries,speaks,runs,gestures a hello, gestures a goodbye is HIS own. People of my age often talk about characters in films like Godfather(Pacino,Brando), Fight Club (pitt), XXX (Diesel), Rocky (Stallone) ,etc. They forget the quiet man with an odd face and the kindest of the simplest of expressions in Forrest Gump. I'm not sorry if you disagree with me, but the character of Forrest Gump owns all.<br /><br />My favourite scenes from this film - Forrest says to Jenny "Cause you're my girl" , Forrest turns around to people running behind him and says "I'm pretty tired, I think I'll go home now", Forrest playing ping pong, Lieutenant Dan v/s God (storm), Bubba talking about shrimps, Forrest asking little Forrest what he's watching and sitting beside him, all scenes involving him running.<br /><br />I criticisize the Americans a lot but this is one of the most American films I have seen and it stands as the most perfect,too. This, and American Beauty are the two best films I have ever seen. I pray I watch a film I like almost 60% as much.</p></body></html>

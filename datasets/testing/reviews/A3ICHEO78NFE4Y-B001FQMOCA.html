<meta name="summary" content="Totally excellent film"></head><body><p>I was never really a fan of Johnny Cash but growing up in the 60's i heard his songs like everyone else.  His life had no influence on me at all.  I actually didn't care if i saw this picture but my partner heard that it was good.  So with no expectations we went to see it.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY.  Everything from story line, costumes, music, set design, acting it was Hollywood first class all the way.  I have never been a fan of Reese Witherspoon either but today i can't speak more highly of her acting.  Joaquin Phoenix sorry to say i never heard of but again this "was" Johnny Cash.  The talents of Reese and Joaquin own singing voice on this film was that of a Broadway show.<br /><br />Not that i'm a Broadway snob but i've worked most of my life on the stage, from Radio City to Broadway to having my own live theatre.  I can be extremely ciritical but this film i give "Thumbs Up."  It just doesn't get any better than this and will be looking forward to the DVD when it comes out.  Great job done by everyone.</p></body></html>

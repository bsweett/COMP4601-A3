<meta name="summary" content="Great film, but emotionally draining"></head><body><p>I won't go into the plot since other reviews already describe it accurately, but this movie is emotionally draining in the same tone as Saving Private Ryan.  Eric Bana's best work.  Despite it not winning any of the Oscars it was nominated for, it was definitely a worthy contender for Best Picture.<br /><br />This film gives a very insightful look into the Palestinian/Israeli conflict from the level of the people involved, without the news angle.<br /><br />Not to be missed.</p></body></html>

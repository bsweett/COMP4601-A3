<meta name="summary" content="Relationship zero!"></head><body><p>Mix match and swing into this confusion of relationship choices. "Closer (2005)" does nothing to answer any relationship questions, buy looks at dysfunctional people trying to and wasting other dysfunctional people's time.<br /><br />  "Closer (2005)" follows the relationship between four individuals: Natalie Portman (Alice), Jude Law (Dan), Julia Roberts (Anna) and Clive Owen (Larry).<br /><br />  Deceit is the main premise for this film.  Mike Nichols (Director) takes this all-star cast and turns them into faux characters. The film is time choppy and leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks. Once or twice works in a film, but not the whole film. It was like playing a crossword puzzle without rationale.<br /><br />  Half way through the film I asked myself, why am I still watching?  One reason; the well-known actors!  This film puts the Hollywood good girls Julia and Natalie into exasperated "dirty" talk that is uncomfortable to listen to.  At times it made me cringe. But acting puts them into "must see" situations.<br /><br />  Some people call it cutting-edge film making, artsy to others, but entertaining? It depends on the personality of the viewer.</p></body></html>

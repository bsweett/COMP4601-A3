<meta name="summary" content="Loved It - Don't Get Sacred Off By Talk of Gross-Out Scenes, Not Many"></head><body><p>I completely loved this movie. I had heard so much about the gross-out humor, and 'women behaving badly' themes, that I was expecting this to almost be a female Hangover. But it's not at all - the core story is much more soulful, and it's really a kind of romantic comedy, but the focus is on Kristin Wiig's character, as opposed to a man. It's a nice counterbalance to all the male-centric movies out there. There is one gross-out scene, and I did wince and cover my eyes at that, but some people like that humor, and so why not have women doing it for a change (we have bodily functions too after all!!) All of the female leads were outstanding, and the 'real-life' friendship between Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig shines through as the centerpiece of the plot in this one. And for what it's worth, my husband liked it too - it's not just a chick flick.</p></body></html>

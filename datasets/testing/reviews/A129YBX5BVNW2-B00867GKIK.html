<meta name="summary" content=""...You Are Awarded The Highest Honour...The Ellie Badge...""></head><body><p>I bought this 4-disc BLU RAY version of "Up" yesterday - Monday 15 Feb 2010 (its UK release date) and watched it last night with the kids.<br /><br />I'll not bore you with its genius, its beautifully scripted storyline, its staggeringly real themes - but I will bore you with the PICTURE QUALITY - because it's simply off-the-charts astonishing.<br /><br />We've got "Monsters Inc.", "Cars" and "Wall-E" on Pixar BLU RAYs - but this takes the gong. To say it's beautiful to look at - is a wild understatement. If ever a film showed how good HI DEF can be, then "Up" is it. The man-hours that must have been put into this - the detail is gob-smacking.<br /><br />The faint stubble increasing on Mr. Fredricksen's chin as the days go by (he wouldn't have shaved), the scuffing on the caps of his shoes, the fingerprint smears on his goggles as he watches the Munz footage as a child in a cinema, the dust particles in the beams of light as the young Carl wanders into an abandoned house on hearing a girl's voice (the love of his life, a young Ellie), the grown-up Ellie, her hair blowing gently in the wind (viewed from the back) as she sits in her chair having been given the awful news about...<br /><br />I don't why it's all so touching, so funny or so charming - it just is.<br /><br />Other brill things include Ed Azner's perfectly cast voice as the grumpy old man Carl, the constantly chattering and whining Russell, the 8-year old Wilderness Explorer boy scout who latches onto to him, his house and his dreams, Dug the soppy talking dog, Kevin the tall South American bird who mimics everything and races across the screen like a demented gangly Road Runner, Christopher Plumber's fantastically sinister voice as the elderly Munz the Explorer - it's all magical stuff. "Up" could even win an Oscar as best film?<br /><br />Disc 1 also contains the wonderful short that preceded the movie "Partly Cloudy", trailers to "Toy Story 3" and "The Princess & The Frog", a making of "Up", alternate Munz endings, while Disc 2 contains loads of exclusive bonus material. Disc 3 is the DVD and Disc 4 is a CD (complete with code) that you load into your Mac or PC to get a digital download copy of the film (portable). It's all fabulous stuff and a genuine joy to look at.<br /><br />Pixar has set ludicrous standards before, but "Up" is just 'so' good - major-league kudos to all involved.<br /><br />Treat yourself to this absolute winner people because you need "Up" on BLU RAY in your home.<br /><br />Breathtaking stuff boys.</p></body></html>

While running away from the police he meets a women played by Franka Potente who he offers to pay for a ride. She becomes in danger as well when she's seen with Bourne and now Bourne has to protect her as well as himself.<br /><br />  Matt Damon and Franka Potente's chemestry is excellent. I love the fact that eventhough her life is in danger because of him  she refuses to leave his side even when she can. Franka Potente has an admireable sweetness to her, haven't seen her before but think she's going places as she can act plus the camera loves her.  I liked the Bourne Identity, it's the Fugitive with spys pretty much. It's much better than XXX, I'd rush to see another Jason Bourne movie before I would to see XXX 2.  I really like this movie and I never really get tired of watching it on cable. I love the car chase even if it doesn't last that long. Damon is great as Jason Bourne and I can't wait for sequels.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Hang up the Phone, and You're Dead.&quot;  Good, Except Ending"></head><body><p>Joel Shumacher/Colin Farrell, team of &quot;Tigerland&quot; comes back with totally different premise.  This time they are given a script from prolific (and perhaps underrated) B movie-king Larry Cohen.<p>Colin Farrell is Stu, New Work publicist who thinks the world goes around just for him.  Then he gets an anomymous call at a phone booth; now he gets it, and the guy on the other side of the phone says: &quot;If you hang up the phone, you are dead.&quot;  <p>And this strange guy with malicious voice really means it, pointing a rifle at Stu's head from somewhere in the high building in New York City (actually, the film was shot mostly in LA).  His wife and would-be mistress arrive at the scene, only to complicate the situation, but the criminal seems enjoying it, and continues to order Stu to do things he never dreamed of.<p>The film is short, which means a good thing.  You cannot keep on forever, holding the attention of the audience in this way, and in fact, the little moralistic conclusion is diappointment.  Thankfully, Colin Farrell (no matter what some people say) is a talented actor, and gives a credible performance as a guy trapped in this incredibly thankless situation.  <p>The supports are Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell (&quot;High Art&quot;&quot;Pitch Black&quot;) and Katie Holmes, but their roles are smaller ones compared to his.  Of more interest is the sniper's role, whose voice must have convincing sound.  &quot;24&quot;'s Kiefer Sutherland is cast in that part, and it works in a terrific way.  <p>Remember, &quot;Phone Booth&quot; is basically a B-movie.  That doesn't mean it is bad; it means, the film has a terrific idea at the core of it, but extends it beyond its limit.  At least, it is better than similar (and more complicated) &quot;Liberty Stands Still&quot; (featuring Wesley Snipes) as far as the tension goes.  You get intense acting from Colin Farrell, intense camerawork (Matthew Libatique, &quot;Pai&quot;) , and ... not so intense ending.  And there, at the end, you remember it's a B movie.<p>Because of several incidents (like the real-life sniper), the release of &quot;Phone Booth&quot; had been delayed in USA.  I don't know the film needed such treatment after all.  It is just an entertainment.  And a good one too.</p></body></html>

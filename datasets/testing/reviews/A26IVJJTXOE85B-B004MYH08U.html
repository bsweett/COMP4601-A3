<meta name="summary" content="Horrible movie, disgrace to original"></head><body><p>I cannot think of a word that truly describes exactly how BAD this film is. Seth Rogan adds absolutely NOTHING to this film. The story line is weak. It was like watching a Roger Moore era James Bond film with all the cheesy parts spliced in together.<br /><br />Jay Chou hopefully got his money up front. I wonder if he took this job thinking, "This will get me good exposure to Hollywood." He played a decent side kick in Cato.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz, let's face it, was an attempt to have some eye candy to distract you from how bad this film really is. Note to producers, she could have been butt naked and I don't think it would have made a difference.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, unless you have 2 hours to kill and there is absolutely nothing else to do. Do NOT watch this film.</p></body></html>

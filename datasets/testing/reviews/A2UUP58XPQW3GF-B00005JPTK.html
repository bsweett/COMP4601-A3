Stars: Not quite Legendary but overall a Fun Ride..."></head><body><p>I AM LEGEND is a sci-fi disaster film that is another attempt at adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel back in the early `50's. The first adaptation being "The Last Man on Earth" (1964) with Vincent Price and the cheesy but entertaining "Omega Men" (1971) with Charlton Heston. Being a remake, "I am Legend" leaves a lot to be desired with the unpredictability factor. However, with the current evolution in CGI effects, expectations would be high. "Legend" is the one version bestowed with a huge budget.<br /><br />A cure for cancer based on the Measles virus of old has achieved partial success. While it does cure the lethal disease, it was one side effect; it mutates human beings into vampire-like creatures that feed on human flesh. Military scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith) is left alone in New York with only a German Shepherd for company, for 3 years he has been looking for a cure but to no avail. Slowly, he is starting to give in to the pressure of being alone and hopelessness begins to sink in. Now, as new survivors surface, Neville is caught by surprise and finds a struggle within himself to remain optimistic in finding a cure or wonder if the human race has been snuffed out for good.<br /><br />The direction by Francis Lawrence (Constantine) is competent enough to handle this kind of project. The first half of the film shows Neville and his dog, Sam in their daily routine. They try to battle boredom and mental collapse by hunting deers, driving around the "ghost city" looking for supplies and even renting videos, hitting golf balls off the East River. It was smart for the director to establish a rendezvous point for potential survivors alongside the river at noon everyday. Neville's loneliness is also emphasized that he has set up a certain spot where he had arranged mannequins as an attempt to simulate a crowd. It was very considerate of the director to consider certain emotions that can creep in when one is isolated in large Empty City with certain creatures lurking in the night. Along with the very delicate link of sanity Neville has to his dog, one can wonder how long a man left alone can last. Certain situation studies have been explored before in films such as "Castaway". Luckily, Neville has more company with a dog than just a volleyball, the dog certainly had more charisma than "Wilson the volleyball". The past is also shown in flashbacks as to what happened to Neville and New York.<br /><br />The film's success also depends on how good the performance is of the lead actor. Will Smith has definitely matured as an actor since his days in "Fresh Prince". Smith's performance is pretty solid as the lead; while he mostly plays a reactionary role, he manages to express the needed emotions in the sequences that I felt his fears, thoughts and loneliness. Sure, there is still the usual snappy charisma that has become his trademark but he manages to sidestep that image and pulls off a very good performance.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect. There is a HUGE plot hole in the beginning of the last act, Neville's meeting with a survivor seemed so convenient that it's almost far-fetched. The "Dark Seekers" have that charcoaled-grayish-dehydrated look that seemed a little fake. (I thought I was watching a Pang Bros. Horror flick for a moment). Thankfully, the characteristics of the creatures are more interesting; they are stronger and faster than the zombies in 28 DAYS LATER, and to make things worst for Neville, they are a lot smarter. This intelligence was displayed with their observance of a "pack leader" and the ability to learn and imitate what they have seen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film didn't have the guts to follow through with its dark premise of pure despair of a lonely man in large city. It opted to settle for the usual heroics and while the film did have some emotional and intense sequences that redeemed it, it went on the direction of faith and Catholicism. While there may be nothing wrong in trying to emphasize human optimism and belief in a higher power, the conclusion was a little less satisfying and quite frankly, it collapsed in its predictability. "I Am Legend" carried a lot of potential but ultimately, it stumbles halfway through and lacked a very powerful climax. I am sad to say it fell just a little short of its truly majestic vision.<br /><br />Recommended! For Sci-fi fans  [3 ? Stars]</p></body></html>

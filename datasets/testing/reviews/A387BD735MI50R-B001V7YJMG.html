<meta name="summary" content="At Last! Children with Gravitas!"></head><body><p>This is an engrossing, eerie pas de deux between two young people who warm to each other in the silvery cold landscapes of Sweden. My DVD automatically started to roll with English dubbing and no subtitles. The dubbing seemed fairly good, so I just left the DVD at this automatic setting. However I perhaps did get a hint of how any translating subtitles might have been very inadequate, because the title itself, rendered in English as "Let the Right One In," doesn't seem quite right. It has a misleading Spike Lee declarative tone to it. Although it plays off a line ritually used by one of the character, it doesn't fit the sense or mood of the film.<br /><br />However translation failings wouldn't seem to make a lot of difference here, because so much of the film's emotion is carried in the silences between the children. These two leads in the film, supposedly both pre-teens, present an astoundingly different view of youth than the one that most current movies and sitcoms typically present. At last, we have examples of young people who are not sexually precocious, wisecracking, and preoccupied with trivial consumptions. We are presented with a more Victorian view of children - quietly observant, unobtrusively intense, capable of profound attachments.<br /><br />It's true that the capacity for such gravitas might arise from the fact that one or both of these children is perhaps actually decades, or even centuries older than appearances suggest. Through some brilliant photography and make-up work, the viewer can at certain moments peer at these children and find the ancient aspect in them. There's an exquisitely subtle shift from pre-teen to old soul that's simultaneously frightening, thrilling, and yet somehow strangely hopeful - or should I say "sanguine?"<br /><br />This film is at heart a unique love story. The children make a rare connection based on fond fascination and need. Looking down the road at what will become of them though, the viewer is left in a frisson of wonder. Which will prevail in the long run - the love - or the need?</p></body></html>

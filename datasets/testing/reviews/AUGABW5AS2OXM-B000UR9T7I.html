This<br /><br />has been a series of outstanding comic book hero movies. The characters<br /><br />are just like they appeared in the original comic books. This movie also has some of the most dazzling and outstanding special effects that you will see in a movie.<br /><br />  Spiderman is riding a wave of popularity. He is beloved by everyone and<br /><br />everywhere. His romance with Mary Jane is still simmering. His friend Harry Osborne is still wanting revenge because of his father's death.He<br /><br />becomes the New Goblin. A new villain comes in the person of the Sandman.<br /><br />He escapes prison and stumbles into a physics testing center. He is changed by one of the experiments being conducted there. He now has the ability to change forms by turning into sand. A meteor crashes near Peter<br /><br />Parker and Mary Jane. A parasite escapes from the meteor. It takes Peter Parker over. He turns into a different person. He turns into an ugly person. He even has eyes for another woman. The parasite leaves Parker and takes over Eddie Brock a rival reporter. Brock turns into Venom an evil villain.It falls upon Spiderman to defeat all of these forces of evil. This makes for an action packed movie.<br /><br />  This is definitely one of the biggest movies to come out this year. If<br /><br />you miss it shame on you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="She's an excellent actress Meryl Streep!"></head><body><p>I love movies with great acting and this movie has great acting.  I hadn't read the book but i heard that the ending is different.  The ending that was picked for this film has a great moral lesson.  I'm sure when your at the top of any back-stabbing company, you must be extremely lonely but the character of Meryl Streep puts awhole new meaning to the works "lonely" and "mean."  The film is funny, whitty, fast moving with increadible costumes.  It would be like watching a Dois Day movie today.  Just beautifully filmed and executed.  I look forward to this on DVD.  Enjoy, you will get your money's worth.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Almost Laugh-A-Minute"></head><body><p>"Wedding Crashers" is a very funny film.  It's got more laughs and potty humor in it than you can shake a stick at.  It's almost perfect, but there's one flaw.  It tries too hard to appeal to both men and women at the same time.  It takes raunchy fun and tries to couple it with a romantic comedy.  The two genres rarely mix well.  Considering this, though, the film is worth multiple views.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are two buddies out for a little tail.  In order to achieve said goal, they crash weddings and go after just about every lady in the joint that isn't a bride.  They charm old folks and amuse the youngsters in an attempt to grab the eyes(and hopefully the panties) of some young woman in the crowd.  They do all of this by a set of rules set by the original wedding crasher, who we run into at the end of the film.<br /><br />Christopher Walken plays the father of Rachel McAdams in this film.  Owen Wilson's character falls for her when he grows tired of chasing women all of the time.  His buddy, played superbly by Vince Vaughn, has to take on McAdams' sister, played by Isla Fisher.  Fisher almost single-handedly steals the show as the psychotic, sex-crazed nympho who literally takes down Vaughn.  The ever lovely Jane Seymour plays Walken's wife, and the rest of the offbeat family is wonderfully acted out.  I won't give away the identity of the actor playing the original wedding crasher, but I will say that his performance was a bit too much at times.  He's funny at first, but much like Stiffler in the "American Pie" films, he begins to be annoying after awhile.<br /><br />If you enjoy gut-laughter, this film is for you.  It runs a tad bit long, especially with the romance between Wilson and McAdams.  However, when the laughs start, they hang around for quite some time.<br /><br />I've noticed how some reviewers find this film to be offensive and degrading to women.  Grow up!  If you can't handle flicks like this that want to have FUN, then you should know better than to watch this type of film.  If you think this flick is degrading to women, I suggest "The Sweetest Thing," with Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate.  In it, the boys get the shaft instead of the stereotypical chicks in "Wedding Crashers."<br /><br />Had "Crashers" stuck with the buddy concept and made this a "guy movie," I'd have given it five stars.  However, with the romance taking up a little too much time, I'm forced to give it a four.  We need more "guy movies" these days.  People are so hung up on being politically correct that we're risking the ruin of the adult comedy.  Thanks to Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson for taking a chance with this comedy.  It's well worth purchasing.</p></body></html>

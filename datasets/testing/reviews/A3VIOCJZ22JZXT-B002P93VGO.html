The viewer never tires of watching him overcome one conflict after another. He commands empathy from the viewer and is in virtual control of the entire film from start to finish. Playing his brother, Liev Schreiber, also demonstrates his considerable skills playing a highly threatening, violent man-beast. We do learn the origin of Wolverine as young Jimmie Logan and his brother discover the gift of an animal nature within both of them and they exercise this violent side in the US Civil War, World War I and II, and the Vietnam conflict. The special effects were outstanding. The other members of the cast were totally superior, including wise cracking Ryan Reynolds and darkly beautiful Lynn Collins. The script was a bit too predictable. However, underneath all the millions of dollars of production and talent, there is a fascinating theme embodied in Wolverine, which is the struggle between the human and savage animal nature of mankind. Wolverine struggles with this duality but part of the fascination in watching Jackman is that at some level every viewer recognizes that we are all like Wolverine, constantly struggling to maintain our higher nature and control our most violent impulses. In this story, we see Jimmie Logan maintain control and seek serenity while his brother allows every violent animalistic impulse to rise to the surface and control his actions. But it is not just his brother who demonstrates a homicidal ruthless nature. Danny Huston plays a project director who will stop at nothing to control the gifts that have been given to the mutants. This is an entertaining film. It is not full of subtle nuance and is rather straight forward story-telling. Jackman and the rest of the cast make it special.</p></body></html>

It's ironic, then, that this is the very thing that M Night Shyamalan - hitherto one of the most innovative and imaginative of modern day storytellers - seems to have forgotten in his latest film, "Lady in the Water," the first truly disappointing movie the young writer/director has made to date (and, no, I'm not forgetting "The Village," which I liked much more than most people did).  Unlike, say, the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy or the "Star Wars" films, in which the filmmakers allow us to see and enter into the fantastical and mythological worlds they've created, in "Lady in the Water" the characters spend most of their time DESCRIBING rather than showing us the imaginary world of their story, resulting in a static, talky film that fails to engage the viewer in any truly meaningful way.<br /><br />The wonderful Paul Giamatti stars as Cleveland, the sweet-natured, milquetoast-y manager of a multi-storied apartment building on the outskirts of Philadelphia.  One night Cleveland discovers a strange woman swimming in the pool after dark, an intruder he soon discovers to be a sea nymph (called a "narf") who has come from the mysterious "blue world" to bring a message of hope to mankind.  Unfortunately, this creature, who calls herself Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, who played a similar emissary-to-a-strange-world role in "The Village"), has also inadvertently brought with her a menacing wolf-like monster which threatens to destroy her before she can make it successfully back to her own world.  With the help of a number of other, amazingly credulous residents of the complex, Cleveland is able to piece together elements of the mystery in the hope of helping Story to do what she came to do and then return safely home.<br /><br />As with his earlier films, Shyamalan is far more interested in mood and imagery than in easy melodrama and cheap thrills.  However, in this case, the film gets so bogged down in explanations and exposition that it winds up talking itself and us to a standstill.  The screenplay cheats right off the bat by relying on an outsider's knowledge of the tale to relate the key elements rather than letting those elements reveal themselves naturally and organically.  As a consequence, the film is never able to convince us of its authenticity, while the plot points begin to feel increasingly arbitrary and silly the longer the movie drones on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film's visual style is every bit as incoherent as the storyline.  For some reason, as a director, Shyamalan proves unable to establish or maintain spatial unity in his misc-en-scene.  He never gives us a clear view of the entire courtyard, so that we are unable to tell where the woods are in relation to the building or even if the woods are real at all (that would certainly be an intriguing concept, though I honestly don't think that was Shyamalan's intention).  For long stretches of the film, we expend our energies trying to orient ourselves in the film's geography, something even the least competent director should be able to do for his audience.  At times we seem to be trapped in some type of concrete fortress, while, at other times and from other angles, the setting seems positively bucolic, overrun with thick vegetation and with Cleveland living in what appears to be a quaint little cottage nestled cozily in some nearby woods (but which is somehow supposed to be only a stone`s-throw from the apartment`s pool).  The film looks as if it were shot at two entirely different locales, and that Shyamalan was unable to meld them into anything even remotely approximating a seamless whole.<br /><br />And that seems to be the biggest problem with "Lady in the Water."  It always feels incompletely formed and half-baked, a thing of bits and pieces rather than a wholly rounded and fully developed work of art.  Shyamalan has struck out in his own ballpark.</p></body></html>

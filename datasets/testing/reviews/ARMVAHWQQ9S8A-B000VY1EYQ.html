<meta name="summary" content="As Good As A Nice Warm Slice of "I Can't Have No Affair Because It's Wrong And I Don't Want Earl To Kill Me" Pie"></head><body><p>Nathan Fillion (of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AQS0F">Firefly</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVN2">Buffy</a> fame) is what drew me to this movie, but it was the creative storytelling and the overall great performance from the cast that made me stay.  From the grumpy old man with a sweet spot in his heart for waitress Jenna, to Jenna's quirky pie-making, to Adrienne Shelley's character Dawn, everything just worked together so well.  While it's not a complex movie (the theme of it is fairly straightforward), the way all the little plots come together makes an aspiring writer like me a little jealous!<br /><br />While "Waitress" is definitely a "feel good movie," it also avoids some of those cliches.  Darker themes are touched on in Jenna's relationship with her husband, but at the same time we never get any of those forced "Lifetime movie" moments.  Instead, we see these characters develop and grow throughout this little movie, giving us a little surprise at every turn.  Nathan Fillion, Keri Russell, and Adrienne Shelley (both as an actor and director) were the best things this movie had going for it, and it overall left me visually and emotionally satisfied.<br /><br />8/10</p></body></html>

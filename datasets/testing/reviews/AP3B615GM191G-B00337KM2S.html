Well, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) gets to do exactly that...for his job.<br /><br />Bingham, while "up in the air" 322 days out of the year, makes a living by firing people at the request of major corporations who would rather not do the dirty deed themselves.  He seems to live a blissfully happy life, unburdened by the responsibilities of home & family, and enjoys his routine immensely.  Until, that is, he meets someone just like him...Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga).  Throw in spunky new sidekick Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), who sets out to change the way he does business, and Bingham is forced to re-evaluate all of life's priorities.<br /><br />What really makes this film work is, much like Gran Torino, the unbiased nature of the storytelling (making it the exact opposite of a film like Avatar).  Viewers are treated to two completely different sorts of life (both on the road and settling down at home) with all the pros and cons included, and must (through Bingham) come to their own conclusion about which life is more satisfactory.<br /><br />The acting is also terrific, with Clooney doing what he's done for years and finding a good thespian match in Farmiga.  However, it truly is young Kendrick who nearly steals the show with her energetic performance.  Her character superbly represents the thoughts and feelings going through the heads/hearts of the viewers, questioning Bingham on nearly ever decision he makes.  I don't say this too often about young people in the film business, but the sky is the limit for this woman based on this incredible performance.<br /><br />Finally, a little anecdote about why this movie may touch you as it did me:<br /><br />When I was five years old, my father played a little trick on me.  He said he had a "magic pill" (a common vitamin, of course!) that would make me stay "five forever", allowing me to go to school and play with my toys ad infinitum.  I took the bait hook, line, and sinker, but only after swallowing the pill were the consequences brought to my attention, such as seeing all my little friends grow up, always having to take naps, etc.  After a bit of contemplation, I then chose the "antidote" to set things right again.<br /><br />Filmmaker Jason Reitman operates under the same concept with "Up in the Air".  We are first given a glance into the seemingly wonderful life of the man on the road, but only upon deeper introspection do we discover the true nature of his often lonely existence.  What makes things interesting, of course, is the fact that his decision is much more meaningful than from some five year old.<br /><br />Thus, I strongly recommend this to film fans of any and all kinds for its deep story and incredible acting.  If, say, Avatar turned you off by its overly black-and-white themes, this is the antithesis.</p></body></html>

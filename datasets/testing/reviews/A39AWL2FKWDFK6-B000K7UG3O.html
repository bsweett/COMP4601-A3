<meta name="summary" content="Overly cutesy predictable comedy"></head><body><p>"Failure to Launch" a mindless comedy featuring Matthew McConaughey as Tripp a 35 year old bachelor that still lives at home with his parents, suffers from a failure to entertain.  His parents hire Sarah Jessica Parker playing professional interventionist Paula to seduce McConaughey into a relationship to get him out of the house.  Terry Bradshaw is surprisingly funny as the father Al.  Kathy Bates' superior acting talent is wasted in her role as enabling mom, Sue.<br /><br />As expected Parker falls in love with McConaughey and problems ensue.  Yeeeesh!  Had I not been a captive on a trans Atlantic flight, there is no chance that I would have chosen to see this moronic flick.</p></body></html>

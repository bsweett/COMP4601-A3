The Russians were pounding Berlin from the land and air, as the once strong German Army scrambled to avoid annihilation. Adolph Hitler retreats into the confines of a bunker to spend his last few days with his mistress, generals, soldiers, fellow cabinent members and their families, and one Traudl Junge, his personal secretary. What follows is a fascinating, and what I consider to be a true horror story, about insanity, desparation, and the end result of hatred.<br /><br />This movie is based on the works of two books, one of them authored by Traudl Junge, which gives this film an air of authenticity and realism that is haunting. Junge spoke as a witness to these events, and in fact, the real Junge bookends the film. Chosen out of five women to be Hitler's personal secretary, she was thrilled to be employed by the Furher, and worked very closely with him, even going so far as to enter the bunker with him and refusing to leave. Junge is never in conflict during the film about her role in the Nazi regime, nor ever questions anyone about the possible horrors that would surface; she claimed innocence. With the Russians pounding Berlin with artilery, and Hitler descending into insanity (ordering armies around that don't exist and talking about a great comeback), Junge realizes all is lost, and her decision is when to save herself.<br /><br />The tour de force performance in this film is Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler with such realism that you cannot believe this is an actor. He captures Hitler when he is screaming at his generals is that is lifted right out of old films of Hitler speaking at large Nazi rallies, and captures a different man when dealing with people close to him.  It's his realism that is eerie; definitely a complex man so successful portrayed.<br /><br />The other horrifying element in this film occurs later on, with Josef Goebbel's wife Magda's poisoning of her five children in the bunker after Hitler's suicide. After making her children drink a sleeping substance, she methodically and ruthlessly kills all of her children by making them bite glass capsules of poison. The scene was so amazingly powerful that I wanted to weep yet no tears came. It became an incredible image for the heartlessness of a regime so bent on perfection and courage, in a final act of desparation and weakness.<br /><br />And don't worry: there is nothing in this film that attempts to glorify Hitler, or make him out to be anything that he wasn't. Even in moments that he treats Junge with compassion, the six million people he murdered are never far out of your mind. In fact, when his beloved dog Blondi is killed in the bunker, and Hitler tears up, you wonder how a man could feel so badly for a pet when he ordered the deaths of so many others. His wedding to Eva Braun is not touching or romantic, but a mere formality. It's amazing, to say the least, to watch someone unfold to frightening effects.<br /><br />Junge went on to escape the bunker, and into a life of hiding, until coming out publicly about her role before her death in 2002. A documentary film was made about her life, in which she was interviewed about what she witnessed. I found Downfall to be the better movie, more thrilling, and ultimately more terrifying, than the documentary. I highly recommend Downfall.</p></body></html>

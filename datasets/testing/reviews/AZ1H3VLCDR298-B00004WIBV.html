<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton's masterpiece"></head><body><p>Tim Burton is the master of moody storytelling, and here he proves his worth as he retells the classic tale of Washingtion Irving's The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow. Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane, a detective from New York sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate an apparent murder. Christina Ricci is fantastic as Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of the most powerful man in town, co-conspirator of something sinister that may be related to the headless horseman, the one behind the killings. What follows is a suspensful mystery, with excellent picture and sound. This DVD has a cast interview on it, as well as the trailer and cast bios. And the sets are fantastic, with lots of grays and dark-toned colors adding to the dark mood. this is one film that totally flat out rocks. Tim Burton does a great job here with a great cast and plenty of action.</p></body></html>

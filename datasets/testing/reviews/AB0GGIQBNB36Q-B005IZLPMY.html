<meta name="summary" content="the arrival of Captain america"></head><body><p>This movie tells the origins of Cap, and does it extremely well. Chris Evans is very believeable as Steve Rogers, both before the transformation of the expirment. And after, And Hugo Weaving as Red Skull. Wooooooooooow, people have complained that this movie was empty. And lacked substance and style, for a movie set during WWII. Question for you, would it really be appropiate to have modern day explosions, which there were plenty of. The director handled Cap with class and dignity, surprisingly following the comics. After he becomes a supersoldier, because the doctor is killed by a Nazi spy. The formula is lost, leaving Rogers to be the only Super Soldier. So the army uses him as a propaganda tool, a nod to what both D.C. Comics, and Marvel comics did during WWII. Using their characters to sell war bonds, Rogers gets tired of this. And goes off on his own, to rescue a squadron. Including his friend, my only problem with this movie. Is that they kill Bucky, but the movie actually makes up for it. For those who didn't like this movie, must have liked the 1990 movie, where Captain America is portrayed as a buffoon. AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TO RESCUE HIM FROM RED SKULL, but I digress. A dignified presentation of a classic comic book character, which is more than I can say for the recent Sherlock Holmes movies. Or the Dark Knight, this is how you handle a Comic book character. Not philisophically, or trying to be afraid to be a comic book movie. It is what it is, I loved this movie. And I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

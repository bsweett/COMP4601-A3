<meta name="summary" content="Nothing that made "Doom" great is here"></head><body><p>In the opening scenes of "Doom", one of the soon-to-be-dismembered Marines in Dwayne Johnson's crew is lying on a bunk playing "Galaxian2", a hand-held game from 1981. The actor was probably born after "Galaxian2" ceased production, which might explain why he's holding it the wrong way around: "Galaxian2" had controls at the top and at the bottom of the game panel so it could be played by two players, one at either end. However our game-loving Marine is holding it like a Gameboy, horizontally, using both sets of controls at the same time. It's possible to read this failure of orientation as a metaphor for the entire film: the filmmakers just didn't understand what they had their hands on here. Having bought the rights to a game with an incredible array of ghastly creatures, wonderful weapons, and some truly terrifying close-quarters combat situations, they decided to ignore it all in favour of dark, overlong stalking sequences with very little payoff. The creatures are rarely seen, and the action is utterly conventional - with the exception of a first-person sequence late in the film, which sounds cool but is actually about as entertaining as watching somebody else play while you wait your turn. Much is made of the legendary BFG, but it's fired twice in the entire movie (and not for lack of SFX budget - the film cost $70 million). I just don't know what they were thinking. "Doom" the game had some truly terrifying moments. "Doom" the movie is a bore. Is the whole idea of game-to-movie flawed? The notion really only appeals to nervous production VPs short on ideas. The bet is that enough curious fans will come out (or rent the DVD), even if it suffers a predictable mauling from the critics. The problem is that the pleasure of gaming is in first-person action, not narrative. While most games do have an over-arching story, it's really just an excuse for sequencing a number of action set-pieces full of the gun-toting mayhem in which the pleasure of gaming lies. But a film needs a story. It needs characters, especially if it is to engage an audience to the extent that a game can. Film's can compel, but they just use different means: a story we become absorbed in, characters we really care about. The game-to-movie still needs to give us that, and yet retain the elements that make the game great. "Doom" does neither. There's a lazy attempt at story (the obligatory corporate greed) and an abandoned attempt at character development (Reaper and his sister). They seem to have forgotten everything else. The result is not only a failed adaptation, but a failed film in its own right.</p></body></html>

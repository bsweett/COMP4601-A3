She is a drug-addicted alcoholic w/ absolutely nothing on the horizon to interupt her slow self-annihilation. Agnes lost her 6yo son in a grocery store 10 years ago, and most of her soul appears to have disappeared with him. Now, she drifts through her half-life, waking just long enough to drain another bottle of oblivion-inducer, or fire up another bowl of extreme pain-reliever. Enter Peter Evans (Michael Shannon), a nice, quiet young man who captures Agnes' devastated heart almost immediately. It's love at first sight, or something like that. Meanwhile, Agnes' total loser of an ex-con / ex-husband, Goss (Harry Connick, jr.) begins creeping around, threatening to move in on Agnes to help her to re-live the bad old days of his violence and control. Peter represents paradise by contrast. All seems fine until soon after Agnes and Peter consumate their relationship. Peter finds a small insect in the bed. Agnes can't see it, but Peter is very convincing! This leads to a downwardly spiralling binge of paranoid conspiracy theories, delusions, self-mutilation, and murder. These are two sick people. Two disturbed minds that have found their match. Two empty souls that have gravitated toward each other's deadness in a hopeless attempt at fulfillment. This is insanity squared, as the two become one shrill voice of un-reason. This can only end one way, and... it does... BUG is a tale of terror with the most hideous psychological monsters unleashed. William Friedkin has captured schizophrenia on film. He's shown what true "demonic" possession is all about, and it ain't pretty...</p></body></html>

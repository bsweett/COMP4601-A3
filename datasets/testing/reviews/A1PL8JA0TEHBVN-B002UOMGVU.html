<meta name="summary" content="Another great film in HD-DVD.  Go, HD-DVD,Go!!!!"></head><body><p>Is this what we were all waiting for??<br /><br />YES!!!<br /><br />Incredible image. Crisp. Rich. Full of detail. Incredible contrast. Amazing colors. This is exactly what HDTV is all about.<br /><br />Arguably Martin Scorsese's best film.<br /><br />I love this film. In fact it is one of my favorites. I just hope they will keep releasing more of them. I also hope other studios will begin to see the light... as Paul Simon would have said: there must be 50 ways to leave Blu-ray.<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />HD-DVD really got me. I was once a Blu-ray supporter, but now I've got to admit. HD-DVD is simply doing what it was suposed to do: DELIVER!<br /><br />This HD-DVD has no extras because the the focus of this format is (for now) to show the public what it can do. I don't quite agree with that. I'd love the extras. But I also must say that an image this incredible is worth anything. I'm sure future releases will have all the goodies regular DVDs have.<br /><br />Just give me more HD-DVD movies! I can't get enough of it.</p></body></html>

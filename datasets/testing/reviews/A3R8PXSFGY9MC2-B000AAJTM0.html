<meta name="summary" content="Pulp Fiction"></head><body><p>After `Reservoir Dogs', `Pulp Fiction' is the film that cemented Tarantino's place in the film world as a director/writer of distinction.  On repeated viewings you can see why and I still marvel at the style of this film.<br /><br />This is made up of a series of vignettes around LA and with a core of the same characters, until everything comes full circle and ties up at the end.  This delivers a fast paced, gritty storyline and whilst the humour is certainly dark, it can't help but make you laugh.  The cast is outstanding and Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis all turn out stellar performances.<br /><br />It goes some way to show how enduring a film is if lines or scenes from it are still quoted many years after it was made and this is definitely one of those film.  The amount of times I have seen a pastiche of this or heard lines from it on TV or from friends is incredible.  The direction is amazing, with a few scenes standing out (like Willis leaning against a wall in close up, with Ving Rhames character chasing him down an alley in the distance),simple perfection.  The plot is excellent too with the non-chronological vignettes unweaving the story as it goes.  The soundtrack, as in most Tarantino film, is a key element and each song matches the scene perfectly and the interaction between the music and actors is a sight to behold (again I`m thinking of the now iconic scene where Uma Thurman dances the twist with Travolta).<br /><br />This is highly lauded and beloved by many fans for good reason and if you haven't seen this yet then snap it up and if you have seen it, then add this to your discerning film collection.</p></body></html>

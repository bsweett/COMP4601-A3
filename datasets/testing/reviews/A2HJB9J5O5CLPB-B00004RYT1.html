<meta name="summary" content="Poor Tony"></head><body><p>Made with a paltry 1960 budget of 1 million and his TV show crew, Hitchcock shows independent filmgoers how to scare people and get great performances. Again, as in all his work, Hitchcock brings together wonderful set designers and locates the perfect locales.  He shoots most of it on a sound stage, but you'd never know it. The Bates Motel is really the first slasher movie set and Janet Leigh, a good-girl-bad-girl, is carved by wild-eyed Tony Perkins.<br /><br />We feel sorry for poor Ms. Leigh, but weirdly, Perkins's character is actually well spoken and sympathetic, a fellow that cares deeply about his poor old mum. The shrink explains the whole thing at the end with lots of 1950's psycho-babble.</p></body></html>

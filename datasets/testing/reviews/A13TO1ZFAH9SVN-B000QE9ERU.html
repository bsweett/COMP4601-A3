<meta name="summary" content="A very sadistic movie"></head><body><p>This is suppose to be a comic book movie. It's very far from it.<p>The Punisher has a pretty simple story. Frank Castle(Thomas Jane) is a retired FBI agent. In his last case a ganglords son is gunned down. Howard Saint(John Trovolta) gets revenge by murdering all of saints family members at a family reunion. They kill him or so they think so, and now Castle is back and looking for his revenge.<p>I read The Punisher comic books when I was younger and I must say I was disappointed with the movie. This is suppose to be a comic book movie where the target audience should be between 10 and 20 in ages. They didn't even attempt to make this a PG-13 movie and it bugs me. I know Frank Castle is a very dark character. He's a very mad character and he's a very violent character.<p>The Violence in the movie is incredible. I couldn't believe how far they took things. I was expecting violence and the comic books were violent, but never to this extent. You never saw people get shot up like this. You never saw anybody get tourted like they do in this. When they rip the guys piercing out of his face I cringed. I never cringe in movies, but this was like watching Scarface. Everybody is sadistic. There's boiling water flying on people and it's a very violent film and in the top five that I've ever scene. The movie didn't need to be that violent though.<p>In the comics Frank Castle never did the things he did in this movie. He didn't do the sadistic planning like he does in the movie. In this film he's planning his revenge like Dumas has Dantes do in The Count of Monte Cristo. Castle was never that sadistic in the comic.<p>The language was also pretty bad and there is some brief nudity. They made no attempt to make it a PG-13 movie. This is the biggest problem I had with the film, because like I said this is a film geared towards teenagers.<p>Thomas Jane was good as Frank Castle. It was a grea piece of casting and he played the part perfect. He looked exactly like the man from the comic and he played it to perfection. The script could have been better but I liked him a lot.<p>This is a very violent film that didn't hold true to its roots. At times it was a very comic book movie. Most of the movie was like watching Scarface though. This is a very violent film and it's definetly not for kids. It's really a four star movie, but because of all the violence I have to give it 2. A lot of it wasn't neccesary and I'm really quite disappointed in Marvel and Lions Gate. At least we have Spiderman 2 to look forward to.</p></body></html>

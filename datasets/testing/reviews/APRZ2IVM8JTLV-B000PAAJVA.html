Score by John Williams.<br /><br /> Starring Mel Gibson, Jason Isaacs, Heath Ledger, Chris Cooper, Rene Auberjonois, Peter Woodward and Tom Wilkinson as General Lord Charles Cornwallis.<br /><br /> This..the story of the American Revolution in South Carolina told through various fictional amalgams of real personages along with real persons and events was a masterpiece when it was first released and time........and the extended cut available on DVD has only confirmed its status.<br /><br /> Rather like GETTYSBURG inspired its own cast and behind the camera creative teams, so did this film...since except for Isaac, Woodward, Auberjonois and Gibson, no one before or since this film have impressed me tremendously............and the film IS endlessly brilliant and inspired. From Gibson's sublime performance as Benjamin Martin...a man tortured by his bloody past in the French and Indian War and, except when fighting, is incredibly unsure of himself to the beautiful cinematography(the film is simply beautiful to look at at times), there is not a single false moment nor a concession to modern degraded sensibilities. The film goes effortlessly from tremendous battle sequences to a tearjerking moment of a father having to leave his daughter to go off to war. Jason Isaacs as the fictionalized version of Banestre Tarleton knocked my socks off in 2000 with his Classic Hollywood style Basil Rathbone/George Sanders villainy and that impression has not diminished. Isaacs well deserved his later roles in everything from BLACK HAWK DOWN to his definitive Captain Hook in PETER PAN.<br /><br /> The history---though condensed in sections(the battles of Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse are combined) is generally excellent with casual references to everything from Kips Bay to Horatio Gates. John Williams....for a change..produced a fine score that can be listened on its own merits without visuals. The dialogue is actual dialogue, rather than mindless catch phrases, with true meaning and emotional import. Historical issues and military tactics are actually discussed. Characters actualy live and breath rather than just exist to provide body count money shots. When someone dies here, the viewer feels it.  The viewer understands what is at stake in this war and feels sadness at the defeats and pride for his/her country as she rises to greatest and victory.<br /><br /> Simply put. I love this film to death. Somehow it snuck out of Hollywood when no one was looking and is one of the greatest films of the 21 st century as well as being that incredibly rare bird....a film about the American Revolution......a rarer good film about the American Revolution and of the handfull of truly great films about the American Revolution.<br /><br /> One of the very few films made after 1980 that is as good as something made before 1965. One of the very few films made after 1980 that I do not automatically have to treat like a special child since it is, after all, a modern film and it can't help itself.<br /><br /> A masterpiece of epic filmmaking. A practical throwback to the 50s/60s era of the genre.<br /><br /> Sit down and show this to the kids.......now.<br /><br /> Enlightening. Ennobling. Entertaining. The reason film is called an Art form.</p></body></html>

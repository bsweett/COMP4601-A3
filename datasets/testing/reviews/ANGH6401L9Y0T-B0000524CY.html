<meta name="summary" content="Caused Quite a Stir When It Was in Theaters"></head><body><p>Remember when you could not bear to eat green pea soup? And dolls were getting their heads turned around all over town? Such was the impact of this truly horrifying movie.<br /><br />But the demonic possession was not the worst part of the movie. For me, the worst was the torture the doctors put the poor kid through, knowing that this sort of thing actually does happen, while the extreme parts of the possession were clearly fiction.<br /><br />The DVD has an opening comment (you don't have to click on it, it just comes on spontaneously) by the director of the movie. He refers to "25 years ago," so the comment itself is pretty old. He says that the reason he wanted to make a film of Peter Benchley's novel was that it was "based on" a true story. That's one of those terms of contact which is just one above "suggested by." In order to believe it is realistically based upon a true story, one would have to believe that demonic possession is not psychosomatic, but literally real. That is, when supernatural things happen that are not being faked, the explanation is that there really is a devil doing it. I don't. So to me, it is entertaining fiction and no more.<br /><br />Having said that, it is entertaining. As I'm sure you know a very young, very pretty Linda Blair plays the possessed child and Ellen Burstyn plays her actress mother. They are both believable and lovable in their rolls before the demon takes over. Oddly enough, one thing that is never really explained is how the demon took possession of the child. She found a Ouija board in the basement of the house they rented in Georgetown while her mother was working on a movie there. This could function as the explanation, but no connection is really made.<br /><br />In one incident, the mother leaves the child in the care of her assistant, who in turn leaves the director of the movie on which the mother is working to look after the child while she runs out to get the child's prescription filled. When she returns, the director is at the bottom of the steep stairway leading from the house to the street, with his head turned completely around. This gets a cop (Lee J. Cobb) interested, and he wanders through the rest of the movie, apparently trying to solve that mystery and a couple of others that crop up later.<br /><br />So most of the story involves two phases: her mother's searching for a doctor to cure her really sick, sick daughter. They do all sorts of tests, find nothing organic, and suggest that it's a comparatively rare psychiatric disorder where a person behaves bizarrely because they believe they are possessed.<br /><br />The mother is not herself religious, but she goes to the local Catholic church and requests an exorcism, either because it my be a placebo cure or because it may actually be possesion: she doesn't frankly care which, so long as she gets her beautiful daughter back. When the young priest who is a psychiatrist for the Jesuits agrees to go see the child, she gives what the audience understands to be convincing proof of her possession, including the famous head turning all the way around. One interesting aspect is that he sprinkles the child with tap water from a holy water bottle, and the "demon" screams about how it burns.<br /><br />So he goes to the bishop and asks for permission to perform an exorcism. At this point we finally find out what all that rigamarole in the prologue about an archeologist priest in Iran was all about. It seems he has some experience with demons and demonic possession, and it is implied that the one possessing the child is the same one whose statue he uncovered in Iran.<br /><br />The exorcism is successful, the child is fine and remembers nothing of the possession, and she and her mother are returning to California, available for the sequel.</p></body></html>

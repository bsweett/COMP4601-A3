The movie itself has some shining moments that really feel like you are back 27 years ago in Raiders.  But sadly a lot of the movie doesn't shine as brightly.  Shia is okay in his role, though he doesn't seem to give much to the overall movie.  He is mostly overshadowed by the other actors in the movie.  Cate is decent as the Russian villain.  Some of the action scenes were very over the top tot he point of being unbelievable.  The story is good, but not a great one.  I thought the last two National Treasure movies had better plots.  The reviews aren't going to stop anyone who grew up watching Raiders from going to see this movie opening weekend, most likely dragging a kid or two with them.  But aside from them, I am not sure if this movie will make a young person a fan of the series.</p></body></html>

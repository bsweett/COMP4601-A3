<meta name="summary" content="Very enjoyable story, but a little touch of deja vu."></head><body><p>Meet Captain Nathan Algren (played by Tom Cruise), bona fide Civil War hero, celebrity endorser of Winchester rifles, and drunkard.  During the early years of the American political and cultural incursion into Japan, Algren is hired essentially as a mercenary to train the Imperial Japanese Army in the ways of modern warfare.  Before he has had a chance to do his job properly, he is called upon to lead a well-equipped but poorly trained force against a "rebel" army led by the samurai lord Katsumoto (played by Ken Watanabe).  During the initial engagement, Algren's force is routed by the samurai and Algren himself is taken prisoner by Katsumoto for the purpose of "understanding my enemy."<br /><br />Thus begins the gradual transformation of Algren from a highly stereotyped American chauvinist to a member of Katsumoto's community.  The early reception is cold and unaccepting, both by Katsumoto's family and his fellow samurai, but over time a grudging tolerance gives way to cautious familiarity and ultimately to full acceptance and respect.  As I observed this process, I could not help being reminded of "Dances With Wolves", in which Kevin Costner's character undergoes a similar rebirth.  This notion was fueled even more by the romantic energy between Algren and the widow of a samurai whom he had killed during his capture.<br /><br />Algren eventually rises to enjoy great respect and admiration among Katsumoto's people, becoming in effect the samurai lord's right-hand man and deputy commander.  He helps lead Katsumoto's forces in several battles against the Japanese army, including the climactic final engagement where his honor is put to the ultimate test (but I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it yet).<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable and moving tale of the clash of cultures, somewhat loose in its historicity, with a strong emphasis on concepts like valor, honor and independence.  The story line was slightly cliche and more than a little romanticized, but hey, that's Hollywood.  Watch it and decide for yourself, but I certainly wouldn't mind seeing it again.</p></body></html>

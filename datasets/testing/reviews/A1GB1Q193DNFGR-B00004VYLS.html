What surprised the entire civilized world was how intense, dark, and mystically provocative the film  turned out to be. The casting of Jack Nicholson as the Joker proved to be  the production's masterstroke, though the choice of Micheal Keaton as Bruce  Wayne/Batman turned out to a lucky break as well. Tim Burton's usage of  updated German Expressinism and Film Noir morphed what could have been a  standard superhero movie into an elaboarate exploration into the dark  interior of modern metropolitan societies and trumatizied adults. There is  a searing honesty to Bruce Wayne's saddness and underlying alienation over  the brutal loss of his parents by street thugs so long ago. Keaton's  emotionally stiffled face shows all the loss and pain in every scene he  appears. The hyestrical dementia of Jack Napier's tansformation into the  Joker is so colorfully recreated for Batman with such comical flourish and  enthusiasm that Nicholson creates another one of his unforgettable screen  personas. Nicholson's Joker maybe a sterotype but he is a lavishely  entertaining character that obviously propelled the movie more than any  other element. Watch Batman for its unapprecaited gothic atmoshere, zany  performances, and genuinely magnificent atmosphere. This was Tim Burton's  entrance into mainstream cineama as a considerable talent, and even eleven  years later the film is still an enchanting walk into the macabre mind of a  master filmmaker.</p></body></html>

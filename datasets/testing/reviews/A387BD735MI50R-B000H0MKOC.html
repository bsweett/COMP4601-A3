But I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Its idea of making a lobbyist for a tobacco consortium the "hero" of the film held promise. This could have been an opportunity to satirize a lot of the political correctness that has been surrounding the whole subject of smoking and health and big business. But I don't think that promise was even remotely fulfilled in this film.<br /><br />What I saw was essentially (and no doubt inadvertently) just another dreary public service ad like the ones that lamely try to convince people not to smoke. The ads on TV pander to teens with slogans like "Smoking stinks" or "Smoking isn't cool."  In this movie the clich&eacute;d message is conveyed by having anyone who ever smoked die. The Marlboro Man, played here by Sam Elliott painted in embittered wasting purple hues - dies. When our lobbyist hero needs to talk to Mr. Big of the tobacco consortium, played by Robert Duvall, our hero can't because, of course, the Duvall character has - died.  I expected a lot more of this movie than such obvious lecturing.<br /><br />In addition to its overall failure though, I found this movie to be made up of many little failures. It's a series of non-sequiturs, loosely cobbled together.  The disconnect starts early with the lobbyist's opening monologue when he says, "Manson kills; I talk."<br /><br />Later, he gets kidnapped by some unidentified group, and is plastered over with nicotine patches. He survives this assault, but his system is left so compromised, he can never again take even one puff of a cigarette without risking death. I'm not aware of any medical consequence like that. Nevertheless, when he later defies Doctors' advice and takes a puff, he does pass out with near-fatal anoxia. This and a dozen other scenes are not funny exaggeration - they are simply ridiculous, random insertions.<br /><br />The writer's/director's lack of any coherent vision for this film becomes plainer yet if you watch the DVD extras, such as the deleted scenes. One of these shows the lobbyist coming down the steps of the Capitol after having delivered a rousing speech on freedom of choice before a Congressional Hearing Committee. As he pauses on the Capitol Building steps, his son (about 12-years-old?) takes a cigarette out of his pocket and starts to light up. His father, glancing over in alarm, slaps the cigarette out of the boy's hand. What was supposed to be the point of this scene - that the father is a hypocrite and is willing to override any "freedom of choice" argument when it comes to HIS son who is smoking? But why would such a young boy even be carrying cigarettes to such a formal occasion in the first place and why would he choose that most public moment to flaunt his smoking habit? It doesn't make sense! But the writer/director didn't axe this scene on the basis of logic. They say in their commentary that they loved the scene, but were forced to cut it simply for reasons of pacing.<br /><br />The DVD commentary overall reveals how flimsy and illogical this whole project was. That commentary degenerates into what is essentially just a round of good old boy jocularity and mutual admiration. The men involved in this project congratulate each other on every point. They praise the tricky brilliance of making the blinds in one scene into the shape of enlarged cigarettes. This touch is absolutely undetectable to the viewers, and would be meaningless even if evident.<br /><br />Then the actors and director repeatedly laud Christopher Buckley, who wrote the book on which this script is based. I can't help but think his father William's reputation for verbal cleverness got transferred to Christopher, unjustifiably at least in the case of this film. Because really, this movie is just blowing smoke.</p></body></html>

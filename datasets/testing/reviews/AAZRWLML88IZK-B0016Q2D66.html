<meta name="summary" content="Revolutionary Road"></head><body><p>A decade after Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet again find themselves playing characters on a sinking ship; however, in Revolutionary Road the vessel is their marriage. The movie is handsomely crafted by Sam Mendes, but the result is an exquisite downer. DiCaprio and Winslet star as Frank and April, a young couple with dreams of ditching their humdrum suburban existence for the freedom and excitement of Paris; however, circumstance stymies them, and resentment follows. Revolutionary Road looks immaculate, and the performances are outstanding, but I feel the movie is more tasteful than emotionally resonant.</p></body></html>

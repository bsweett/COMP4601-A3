<meta name="summary" content="WOW! A DECENT HORROR FLICK! FINALLY!"></head><body><p>The last couple of years have been the crappiest years for horror films I have ever seen. People flocking to witness PG-13 horror films like The Ring 1 & 2, The Grudge, Darkness, White Noise ect ect. It's crap.<br /><br />But this year looks a bit more promising with movies like The Amityville Horror, House of Wax (both remakes, but hey, nobody obviously has any new GOOD ideas) and The Devil's Rejects.<br /><br />Now on to the actual movie itself. Even though I wasn't overly impressed with the original Amityville film, I respect it and it was decent for it's time. But the 2005 remake proves to be a bit better than the original, and shows that people still know how to make scary movies.<br /><br />What I liked about The Amityville Horror was that it not only scared with you sudden, frightening images and shock value, but the house itself was psychologically scary. The house itself was the scariest character in the film, because of its strong sense malevolence and its underlying presence that just is foreboding terror and horror. And I've always had a stong fear of houses that may be haunted so I was easily scared by this movie, and I'm not one that is easily scared by most movies.<br /><br />Plus I liked all the performances in the film and the film had a great pace that never slowed down.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who likes scary movies, and I especially recommend this movie to anyone who thought The Grudge was scary, because if you thought The Ring or The Grudge was scary (which it wasn't at all), this should scare you into a mumbling idiot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Be Cool" Review!"></head><body><p>F. Gary Gray's pointless sequel to 1995's "Get Shorty" has John Travolta reprising his role as lone shark turned movie producer, Chili Palmer. This time around, Chili wants out of movies and into the music industry. His first prospect is the gorgeous and talented Linda Moon (played by R&B singer Christina Millian) who is being mishandled by her current managers. In attempting to acquire her services, he goes up against a serious of outrageous bad guys including a gangsta rap honcho and his misfiring associate, a goofy Caucasion pimp, a gay bodyguard, and some Russian assassins. "Be Cool" has some amusing moments but it is way too watered down to be useful. Gray opts to play the film more like a big-budget Hollywood sequel with tons of big stars and goofy cliches than to give Elmore Leonard's style the attention it deserved. Previous attempts to adapt Leonard's work (Out Of Sight, Jackie Brown) were home runs because they played their humor more smooth and subtle where "Be Cool" tries too hard to be a comedy. Travolta doesn't bring anything new to the table in his portrayal of Chili and the script has the usual rehashed material that comes with sequels. If "Be Cool" had half of the character and style as "Get Shorty", they might have had something but unfortunately, it offers nothing more than a few assorted laughs.</p></body></html>

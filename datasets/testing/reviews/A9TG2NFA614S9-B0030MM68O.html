<meta name="summary" content="A Complex Character in a World of Hurt"></head><body><p>"The Hurt Locker," this year's Oscar winner, is a very intense Iraq combat film in which Staff Sergeant James (played by Jeremy Renner) is extremely fearless and very adept at defusing planted bombs, but very inept at protecting from harm the men he works closest with. He's a risk-taker, a reckless soldier, who is baffled by civilian life but thrives on the danger of his mission. As a civilian, a fish out of water, an endless line of cereal products in a supermarket flummoxes him, and is a mine field, but yet in a real mine field, he thrives on danger and facing death every day.<br /> He's a complex person who walks fearlessly into an area planted with bombs, but he's not a person to be envied, admired or emulated.<br /> Ironically he has probably saved hundreds of lives by his bomb defusing skills, but saving lives isn't really what motivates him. It is his own personal adrenaline rush, his egotism, and self-absorption which keeps him going. He's not a war lover per se who goes out and slaughters the enemy indiscriminately, but he has the perfect job for his personality because it gives him a chance to play a kind of Russian roulette with his life.<br />The movie shows him in off-duty situations. He's a heavy drinker, heavy-smoker, and a person who enjoys violent interplay with his mates. They don't like him; they hate him and fear him even though at times he briefly shows compassion towards them. He's a man's man in his own mind, a cowboy, but basically a loner.<br />Though filmed in Jordan, you get the feeling that you really are in the mean streets of Iraq. The movie won't bore you; it's violent and bloody, but it's the character of Sergeant James that will stay with you. Is he the kind of man who is going to save the world, or is he part of the problem?</p></body></html>

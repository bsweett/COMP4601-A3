<meta name="summary" content=""All Work And No Play Makes Jack A Dull Boy""></head><body><p>Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances of his career as a caretaker during the winter months at an elite isolated hotel in Colorado that is closed down for the season. At this hotel (way up in the mountains) only he and his wife and son live, and what follows are weeks of hell as Jack (the name of the Nicholson character) becomes almost possessed by outside forces. He becomes arrogant, verbally assaulting, and violent, as he attempts to kill his family. Shelley Duvall is heartbreaking as the desperate wife who tries to escape this hellish hotel with her son. The film (based on the Stephen King novel) was directed by genius Stanley Kubrick who also co-wrote the script. The movie was not without its problems during production: Nicholson was not pleased with the many times in which the script was rewritten, sometimes minutes before the scenes were shot. He eventually quit memorizing pages the night before, instead memorizing the lines given to him before the camera rolled. Shelley Duvall suffered exhaustion from the emotional aspects of her character. For the baseball bat scene Kubrick demanded Shelley do it over and over for a total of 127 takes!. Duvall eventually suffered severe hair loss. When "The Shining" was originally released to theatres in 1980 the movie was pretty much forgotten, only becoming a modest success. Most critics even panned the film. However, over the last 30 years the movie has become a true classic thanks to the home video market and huge DVD sales. Truely a scary film with excellent performances, especially by Nicholson, I watched this one three times in one weekend. Very rarely do you get horror films with this kind of acting. In one word: excellent. This two disc set also contains the trailer, behind the scenes footage, commentary, and more.</p></body></html>

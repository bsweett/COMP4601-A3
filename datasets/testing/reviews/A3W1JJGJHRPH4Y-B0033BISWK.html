<meta name="summary" content="A very incarnational film"></head><body><p>A friend of mine and I were sharing opinions about District 9. I liked it better than I thought I would. He thought it was brilliant. He wrote that it was a very incarnational film. This was a definite theme. The main character was contaminated by a liquid and he was slowly being turned into an alien. The man had insights into the human condition and the alien condition that he never had before. He was selfish and became sacrificial at the end. Another example, the gangster wanted to eat alien flesh so that he could become an alien. The bad military officer was eaten at the end. Some of the aliens were more humane than any of the humans.<br /><br />The movie's newsreel style was a slight turn off at the beginning, but it grew on me. The foreshadowing was a key part of the picture. Hinting at regular intervals at what was coming, kept my interest in the movie. The special effects were very good. The character development, except for the main character, was very limited. The mother ship just hanging over the city was a cool special effect. The parallels of the treatment of aliens in the movie and apartheid were strange.<br /><br />The movie is deeper than one thinks at an initial viewing. The movie stays with me and I keep coming back to the themes it presents. The movie is very subtle in some ways. I strongly recommend the movie.</p></body></html>

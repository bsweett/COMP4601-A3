<meta name="summary" content="Totally  Excellent Ride"></head><body><p>This DVD  is brilliant; its a pity that the special edition had to be packaged separately at almost double the price and released a day later.<br /><br />Great action, great actors, ... sensual to the max, and a totally brilliant piece.<br /><br />The twist in this film is probably ( it seems ) a little too subtle for some, but its good enough for me ... adds a different aura to the Van Helsing mythos, and a good possibility of a sequel</p></body></html>

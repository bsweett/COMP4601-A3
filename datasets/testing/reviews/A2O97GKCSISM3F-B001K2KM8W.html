<meta name="summary" content="I was wrong about my initial review"></head><body><p>I must be in the minority of not caring much for this film. Don't get me wrong:I like horror films, and fairy tale adaptations-Snow White:Tale of<br />Terror, included. But this film just did not sit well w/me, it wasn't the director or the actors, it was the story itself. The ending was a major letdown for me, because it wasn't very good. The best aspect were the effects.I'm not sure what else to say.<br /><br />Jan. 24, 2011)Well, now I realize I was wrong to criticize this movie the way I did, I just watched it for a second time and overall liked it. This time around, the story made alot more sense. I've always liked Good vs. Evil stories, I'm not sure how the director came up with this, but he's got one hell of an imagination. When I can afford it, I will own it.</p></body></html>

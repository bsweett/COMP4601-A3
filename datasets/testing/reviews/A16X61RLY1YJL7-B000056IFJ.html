<meta name="summary" content="The Terminator - A Sci-Fi classic!"></head><body><p>Before there was The Matrix and a dark vision of the future with machines dominating humanity there was The Terminator!  With its dark vision, extraordinarily well laid out plot and "Arny" starring as the bad guy, this film was destined to succeed.  Not only was there an outstanding script, written and directed by James Cameron, but those starring in the film made it the success that it is and only to be matched by its sequel.<p>The Terminator is James Cameron's first film and arguably the best film of his career.  While "Conan the Barbarian" put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map, The Terminator put him in the dead center of the map and launched him on a streak of highly successful action movies.  It was extremely interesting to watch a couple of the Special Features and find out that James Cameron and crew were basically putting this outstanding sci-fi classic together on a shoestring budget!<p>The great thing about Arny in this movie is that he didn't even have to say much, he just had to be cool and it worked perfectly for him.  Linda Hamilton performs admirably as we see her character go through the change from the shy and sheltered young woman to the somewhat hardened heroine by the end of the film.  Michael Biehn's performance as the sacrificial hero of the film is perfect!  Along with the outstanding leading cast, look at the secondary characters, to name just a couple, Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield.  Even one of James Cameron's favorites, Bill Paxton has a small role in this extraordinary film.<p>The more interesting aspect of this film when put in the light of the first two films and the third one that's in the theaters now is from a story standpoint where this first film is just the first paradox of the many that come about throughout the films, raising several "what ifs" about the "whole" story!<p>The premise:<p>We're brought into the film brilliantly as we see The Terminator make his trip through time, showing up and not taking any "no" answers to his request for the clothes of a young punk!  We're then taken to Sergeant Kyle Reese's time jump and a consequent search for clothes as well, but he's not so lucky and is immediately set upon by the police.  Jumping forward a bit, the Terminator has made his move and Reese has stepped in to try and save Sara.  While they're running from the Terminator and the police at the same time, some of the most imaginative filming in the history of film is going on as the scenes cut to the dark future of the early twenty first century and the machines are attempting to eradicate humanity.<p>I highly recommend this outstanding science fiction classic to all who haven't seen it yet, for it is truly one of the best films in the history of the genre and well worth repeated viewings.  I've watched this film many more times than I can remember but it was certainly great to see it in the widescreen DVD format, something I haven't seen since this film was in the theaters.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>Other Voices - A documentary that includes a new James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger Interview.<p>The Terminator:  A Retrospective documentary<p>Several deleted scenes with commentary<p>Theatrical trailers<p>And several other interesting special features</p></body></html>

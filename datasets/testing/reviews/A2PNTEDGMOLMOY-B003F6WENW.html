All the elements were there, from a great comic premise to a stellar cast (even down to its supporting roles) and the guts to go for an 'R' rating in a PG-13 age (PG-13 being more box-office friendly).  But at the end, despite a couple of good laughs and inspired scenes, "Wedding Crashers" is a good comedy that could have been great.<br /><br />The plot is simple.  John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) crash weddings to meet horny girls.  This premise leads to a great (if very long) opening montage as the daring duo crashes wedding after wedding, invariably ending up as the life of the party and in bed with beauties.  Their cover stories of how they are tangentially connected to the family are clever, and there are several references to "the Rules."<br /><br />But as the wedding season winds down, there is "One Last Score."  The eldest daughter of the Cleary family (the Maryland version of the Kennedys) is getting hitched in the biggest wedding of the year.  John and Jeremy crash, and John violates the biggest crasher rule of them all - he falls in love with the delectable Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams, of "Red Eye" fame).<br /><br />John and Jeremy are invited back to the Cleary estate, where Dad (Christopher Walken) and Mom (Jane Seymour) hold court over the typical upper crust version of the Family from Hell.  While John must try to win the heart of Claire away from the dastardly WASP-on-Steroids, her fiance Sack, Jeremy must deal with the clinging, hyper-in-love younger Cleary daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher, who would steal the movie if given the chance).<br /><br />This astounding premise is mildly funny, but not up to expectations.  Walken, one of my absolute favorite actors and a comic genius, is given surprisingly little to do.  It's a waste of Christopher Walken if you see him in a comedy and he doesn't inspire any laugh-out-loud moments.  But there are no Walken Moments to be found in this film.  Similarly, Jane Seymour could have been hilarious as the oversexed Mrs. Robinson character, but she virtually disappears from the film after a big scene.  And Claire is given surprisingly little to do other than to play the object of desire.<br /><br />The movie devolves into a long, "will John get the girl" story that is completely drawn out, and the flick's few moments of Third Act comic inspiration just don't quite make it.<br /><br />This is not to say that you won't enjoy "Wedding Crashers."  However, we must regret the fact that "Wedding Crashers" won't become one of those hallowed all-time comedies, and it could have been.</p></body></html>

When considering the expository nature of the source material, it's amazing that "The Da Vinci Code" came off as well as it did. Though overlong and rather talky in spots, Howard has crafted a diverting mystery-thriller that benefits immeasurably from Sir Ian McKellan's bravura performance. Audrey Tautou is the ideal Sophie, but Tom Hanks cannot overcome his miscasting as Professor Robert Langdon. Still, it's a brave attempt.</p></body></html>

Peter Sarsgard's perfomance is particularly good, and Portman also does well in her hopeful effort to break away from wooden Star Wars roles.  But overall, what writer/director/actor Zach Braff delivers is more of what has become Indie formula.  If you `ve seen (starting with) "The Graduate," "Donnie Darko," "Napoleon Dynamite," "The Royal Tennenbaums," "Rushmore," "Ghost World" and any number of other "indie" efforts, you've seen better versions of the same.  Actually, "The Graduate" isn't really an indie, but it nailed for all time the whole detached/alienated youth thing that has been a well for indie directors to go back to again and again. (But it also had terrific soundtrack to help it along.)  And you know the story: quirky boy or girl in quirky unexpected plots filled with quirky friends, with lots of dead stares (usually one or two from a couch) suggesting some kind of existential void that will be filled by movie's end (inadequately of course, since that is Life, but recognizing that fact is itself a victory - of sorts).  It's enough to make you want to sit down and watch Kill Bill, volumes 1 & 2, just to see something happen.</p></body></html>

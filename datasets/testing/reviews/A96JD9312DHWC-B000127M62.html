They no longer remember "The SpringWood Slasher" and what the dozens of kids he killed, nor do they recall that their parents brutally enacted revenge upon him by burning him alive. They've also forgotten what he did about that and how he came for them all, tasting the fears buried in their dreams as he knifed his way through them one fingerblade at a time, and they've stopped recalling the bodycount that meant. For all the terror he managed to make while rocking Springwood's youth, he has now become something that nobody can recall. Knowing what that means and how that denies him the pleasure of being the beast he's always wanted to be, he comes up with a plan that will let him make the children fear again and make them believe in Freddy. By disguising himself as the mother of another legend lost in time, he calls out and awakens something that has the potential to make people believe. Still, the menace known as Jason isn't the easiest monster to control...<p>When the rumors first began surfacing in the 1980s abut this movie coming to pass, all my friends and I used to sit around and talk about how great it would be and who we thought would win. I, always partial to Jason after he became something more than a man, argued day in and day again about it, thinking that the superstalker had more in his bag-of-tricks than he got credit for. Regardless of which sid eof the fence you feel on, however, we all knew that this was a match-up we'd wanted ages to see, and one that we thought would never be made because years upon years passed. When I finally found out that this time was "go time" and that I could actually see the end result of decades of pondering, I went and did something I rarely do - going as far as to brave the bipedal disease to see the legends that haunted so many of my childhood dreams. And it was truly worth it. <p>Seeing Robert Englund dawn the glove one more time and do a little backstory with it was nice, and nicer still when you looked at the amount of money that had to have been pumped into the set-up. There were the little things that had been touched up from the last time we saw Freddy hit the big screen, with his face made to look more menacing with subtle refinements, and there were many of the same things we remembered about him from the "good old days." The twisted pieces of humor floating around in the movie, the one liners we have all grow to love; they were all there and they were all thriving. It was like picking up with Freddy, jokes and darkness and all, and having that ball to run with again. Couple that with Jason, the walking campground massacre machine that he was, and add in the fact that they get together and have a lot of fun before having it out, and you have yourself something interesting.<p>Combined with this was something I had seen in that many horror movies in a while - and especially not in a Jason movie for quite some time - and that was a body count with some horribly violent deaths.  Instead of an MPAA piece of bent on the destruction of a franchise, it was an out-an-out horror movie that didn't kid around with what we were about to see. From the beginning, with Jason heaping helping of his machete onto the unwanting and the unwilling, to the end and the fight between Freddy and Jason, there was blood and blood aplenty. Jason did what he is probably best know for, creating an atmosphere and then walking in like a plague that nothing can stop, and Freddy did what he does - playing with the fish he wants to fry. Yeah, it's all good stuff.<p>Couple into that equation the fact that there are a drove of deleted scenes that complete many parts (the beginning, for one making it better) , that an extra ending is also on the DVD that allows you to have the beast you might want to win, and that there's a lot of other extras and you have yourself a showdown that is worth picking up on DVD.  You can listen to R.E. as he talks about the movie, skip to deaths, watch a video, and play around with quite a few other trinkets on your way to the torso hatchery. Its really nice to see another chapter of the nightmare unfold after as long.</p></body></html>

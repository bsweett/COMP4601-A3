<meta name="summary" content="Thora Birch shines as an outsider in the world..."></head><body><p>Outsiders Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) have clung to each other for years, counting the days until their high school graduation when they can finally get an apartment together and begin their "real" lives - or so they think. But life for these two alienated young women is far from easy, even after high school. Finding a place for themselves is going to be a longer, stranger trip than they can imagine.<br />  Birch and Johannson have a weird but fascinating symmetry, with their masks of cynicism and hardness and sharp humor to keep the rest of the world at bay. Enid ( Thora Birch) is the real center of this picture, especially as her veneer cracks and her insecurities begin to show. She turns out to be far more alienated and lonely than she seems at first and I was awed by Birch's performance here.<br />  When they decide to play a prank on an equally alienated adult, played by Steve Buscemi, Enid and Rebecca begin to spin off from each other. Enid is fascinated by the guy but Rebecca is not. Enid forms a strange relationship with him, one that affects her profoundly and threatens her friendship with Rebecca.<br /> Not just another teen flick (in fact, I'd guess the average teen might find it depressing) but more of a coming of age story made for the outsiders in the world. Loved it!</p></body></html>

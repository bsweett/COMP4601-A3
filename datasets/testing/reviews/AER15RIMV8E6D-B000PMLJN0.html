<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Actually Scared Me!!!"></head><body><p>I saw this movie at a theatre the night it was being closed down. (I miss that theatre, I had a lot of good memories there!) The funny thing is; I was the only person in the room watching Dead Silence. It got really scary for me. I got scared enough that I literally moved to the back so no one would sneak up behind me and scare me. That part in the hotel room with that red light blinking on and off Billy's face was very creepy. Another part that creeped me out was when the Clown doll is in the rocking chair in the darkness and whispers "Come closer." Being a horror fan, I was surprised about this movie. If you love horror, suspense and creepy dolls, you'll love DEAD SILENCE!!!</p></body></html>

That's all there is to it.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars, but then what do I give someone like Akira Kurosawa, or Bloody Sam, or the late, great John Huston?<br /><br />The actors are amazing across the board. The score by Tyler Bates is one of the best ever! Mind-blowing. Here's a guy who knows how to score  this type of motion picture--at last.<br /><br />The thing I didn't care for, however, no disrespect meant, Mr. Zombie, were all those terrible 70s songs. Oh man, that was painful to listen to, especially towards the end, during the grand finale. Damn near ruined the ending, but not quite, because the film itself is so powerful it overcame the lame<br /><br />tunes. But, as I said, the Tyler Bates score is incredible. The DP Phil Parmet also did an amazing job.<br /><br />I just can't say enough about this powerful horror flick.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I had no idea Pricilla Barnes had any acting ability until I saw her here. She should have been nominated for an academy award; she is that good in this.<br /><br />The scene she is in will knock the wind out of you; she is so believable, and so convincing at what she does, it will be nearly difficult to keep watching.<br /><br />The Texas Ranger played by William Forsythe is just plain<br /><br />topnotch all the way.<br /><br />I just wanted to say something to the talented Rob Zombie, should you be reading this, the character wearing the potato sack over his head at the beginning of the film, and also later on during the last third, etc., should never have taken the sack off his head--because that was one menacing get-up, bro. You see, once he took the sack off, the burn makeup they had on his face reminded us of Freddie Krueger and it did look kind of lame.<br /><br />In fact, both Freddie Krueger and Michael Myers are old hat and ought to be retired. Man, we've had enough flicks about them.<br /><br />Anyway, Devil's Rejects rocks big time! Can't wait to see what else Rob Zombie comes up with.</p></body></html>

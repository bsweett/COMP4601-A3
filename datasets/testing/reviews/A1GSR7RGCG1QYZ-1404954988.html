Not being too excited about his work after seeing the devastatingly poor film As Good As It Gets, I thought that he may be able to redeem himself with some Sandler magic, while showcasing the point (like P.T. Anderson did) that Sandler has this very rich emotional side to him as well as the hysterical moments.  Sadly, this never did happen.  With an extremely choppy story, some overzealous acting by everyone involved, and one of the poorest production values this side of the Hollywood Mississippi, Spanglish proves that you can have a powerful cast, an interesting idea, and an Oscar winning director, but unless you compile them correctly, all you have is a jumbled mess of garbage.<br /><br />My largest issue with this film has to be the unconnected story.  There were so many creative ideas in this film, that from the outside it looked like it could have been an Oscar contender, but as you view it from the inside, it is nothing but unfinished roads and dead ends.  Brooks knows how to tell a story, in fact, he has won an Oscar for telling his stories, but in Spanglish, he took in more than he could handle.  There were so many different elements in this film, from Leoni's secret, to Sandler's cooking, to Vega's mothering skills, to a child's dream, that Brooks could not keep up with them all and successfully bring conclusions to each of them.  Spanglish jumped from one moment to the next without giving the viewer an opportunity to say, "Well, at least that was resolved".  It was so choppy that I hoped that Brooks would have provided seatbelts to anyone watching.  With all these themes and elements converging into a very unclimactic ending, you leave this story with a sense of "wha..." You have no real grasp on this story, the characters, or the ending as the final credits begin to roll.  Who was the true protagonist to the story?  Who was the central focus?  What were the major themes that I should have been watching?  There were so many negative "who" and "what" questions at the end of this movie that I immediately threw the case to the corner of the room as if it were possessed.  Brooks crafted a pitiful story that he could not control, and the final product was this hastily made story, which began in the middle of nowhere and thankfully ended there as well.<br /><br />With the story giving us nothing but questions instead of answers, it is then left up to the actors to carry the weight of the entertainment on their shoulders.  Again, with Sandler, Leoni, and Vega, you think that you would have an amazing dynamic set in place that a story could be poor without anyone noticing.  Well, let me tell you ... it was noticeable.  Sandler was not the lead that Brooks needed for this film.  While it is obvious that he can play an "every man" quite well, it is the emotional pressures that he has trouble with.  The scene in which he is asked to cry is ... well ... hysterically pathetic.  There is just no excitement around his character, and at one time I referred to his character in this film as "bland".  I think it is because Tea Leoni, who puts too much emotion into her character, poorly balances him out.  Here you have Sandler doing a low-key performance, and Leoni is well over the top.  There was no development in either of their characters, just screaming and crying.  This does not help progress the story well either.  Vega added nothing more than a "cute" element that honestly wasn't needed at all.  The only character that I thought did an exceptional job was Cloris Leachman who took these horrible performances and created her moment to shine.  She stole the film from everyone else, and I was proud of her.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that if your films have won Oscars in the past, and you are living well off The Simpsons money, than you have the budget to film actors actually driving a car to their destination instead of just using a green screen and fake driving.  Maybe it was just me, but I felt as if the production value of this film was not Hollywood standards.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind a low-budget film at all, but I felt that Brooks was being super-cheap in Spanglish.  This hurt this film tremendously.  Maybe it was the DVD transfer, but it felt as if Brooks was cutting numbers in the film and it began with the production value.  It started out strong, but somehow felt less and less like itself by the end.  This did not make for good cinematic viewing.<br /><br />Overall, I was very unimpressed with this picture.  Brooks had a decent idea that somewhere along the creation of it went horribly wrong.  One could say that he had too many ideas and could not carry the weight of them all successfully on his camera.  There were ideas piled upon ideas that literally went nowhere, nor didn't really have any conclusion.  The elements were there, Brooks couldn't do anything with them.  Coupled with the fact that there was not any decent acting in the entire film.  This emotional step was too big for Sandler (and too fast), while Leoni was too over-the-top.  Vega felt like a stand in, while I just couldn't grasp the kiddy elements.  Finally, what hurt this film the most, I believe was the poor production value (especially in the car scenes) that brought this film into the realm of bad news bears.  While I think I am in the minority, I believe that this was not the greatest outing for Brooks, nor anyone else involved.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****</p></body></html>

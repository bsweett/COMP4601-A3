<meta name="summary" content="A Picture of Grace Under Fire"></head><body><p>This movie puts us in Queen Elizabeth's shoes. It shows us the burdens of royal office from her point of view. So it provides an unusual perspective - an alternative to simply gawking at royalty from outside their gates.<br /><br />Helen Mirren brings wonderful gravitas to her role, mixing it with the homely English capacity to push through. She's someone who reigns on the one hand, and who serves her family picnic salad and investigates how to jack her car out of the mud on the other hand. (I didn't even know that the Monarch drives her own car a lot of the time.)<br /><br />There are several commentaries on the DVD. I found the director/writer commentary a little dry, with a sort of unpleasant testiness in the exchange between the two. Robert Lacey's commentary is a bit livelier, so if you only have time to listen to one commentary, I suggest you make it Lacey's account of the history behind some of the royal protocol.<br /><br />Then if you would like to consider the role of monarchy a little further, I suggest you check out the "The Swan," a film starring Alec Guinness and Grace Kelly. This is perhaps Grace Kelly's most overlooked film, but possibly her best. The movie is based on Hungarian writer Ferenc Molnar's famous work. It features a brilliant closing speech by Guinness, arguing that a Queen's duty is to glide alone and serene away from all popular pastime and indulgence.<br /><br />Since Princess Di came on the scene, everyone automatically cast her as - the rose - the swan. However, this Helen Mirren movie makes a good case that Elizabeth II, purse and pumps and all, has nevertheless these last 50 years, kept faith as the swan.</p></body></html>

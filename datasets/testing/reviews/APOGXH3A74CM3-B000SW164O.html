It moved along at a decent pace with supernatural undertones, but took a sudden turn that I should have expected but didn't,  which caught me by surprise.<br /><br />Dakota Fanning gave a sublime performance and De Niro had a couple of really creepy moments that were 180 degrees from the understated performance he started out with.  Enjoyable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Vindictive Vendetta"></head><body><p>Another graphic novel comes to life in captivating motion picture treatment. V for Vendetta is an exciting look at the post apocalyptic world created by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.<br /><br />There's suspense, intense drama, a great story...everything that you want from of good movie in the genre. Critics that say V for Vendetta glorifies terrorism should get out of the movie reviewing business and get into politics.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is chock full of good acting by good actors that is a jolt of fresh air from the stale performances that overrun Hollywood.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is great, as are the main supporting cast. Unfortunately, it might be easy to forget that this is Hugo Weaving with another awesome performance (it sure is easy to remember the awesome performances by Hugo Weaving of the feared Agent Smith in the Matrix series or of the menacing Elrond in the Lord of the Rings series, no?). Weaving's Guy Fawkes mask never comes off to reveal his portrayal of V.<br /><br />V has a vendetta. He will attempt to bring down the Fascist government created by the apocalypse. He will deal with the leaders of the fascist regime and with those that made him what he has become. The story of his endeavors is very well put together and fun to watch.<br /><br />Highly recommended for adventurists that like their action with a cool, believable story.<br /><br />Add it to your collection.</p></body></html>

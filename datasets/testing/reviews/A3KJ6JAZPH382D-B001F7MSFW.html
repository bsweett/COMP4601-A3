<meta name="summary" content="Princes, Demons and Barry Manilow"></head><body><p>The frenetic and kinetic sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AK3S4Y">Hellboy</a> is a madly imaginative romp that has even more zip than the first. Benicio Del Torro increases the depths to each character, given them emotional play around the story and keeps the ideas running. Del Torro brings his gift for visual flair into the movie ala his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a>.<br /><br />The other point in "Hellboy 2's" favor is that Hellboy begins to feel the conflict between the world of humans and of his own kind. The conflict with the elvin world presents Liz with a piece of knowledge that she must keep secret. And Abe falls in love.<br /><br />It's the love factors that make this most interesting and provide the balance of humor. The scene with a beer-lubed Red and Blue singing along to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005USBH">Barry Manilow</a> "Can't Smile Without You" is a classic. Moments like that are what helps keep "Hellboy 2" flying high, and make it a better film than the original.</p></body></html>

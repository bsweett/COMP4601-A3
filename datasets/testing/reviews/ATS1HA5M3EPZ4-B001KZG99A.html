I know some people think there are a lot of them out there and might be getting sick of them...but you have to face it, they are a great source of material.  And they are getting better as a whole.<br /><br />With the release of three superhero movies this summer (Iron Man, Hulk, The Dark Knight), you would think one of them really stunk.  Not so.  And with the release of Watchmen next year, I gaurentee many people will see a much different side of comic book heroes then they have before.  But I digress.  Let's talk Iron Man.<br /><br />Iron Man is an iconic character in the Marvel universe.  Everyone knows his name, partially thanks to Black Sabbath.  But bringing him to the screen could have been really tricky.  Especially when you announce Robert Downey Jr. is going to play Tony Stark, the ambitious, brilliant and self centered billionaire industrialist who becomes the title character.  Downey might seem, to fans, too smarmy for the role.  But thankfully he is a great fan of the character himself and choose not to make any great changes.  For the most part, he plays Stark brilliantly, but adds his own touch as well.  In the comics, Stark is a brilliant playboy, with very little sense of humor.  As for Downey's version, he brings wit and a sense of being aloof.  It's just what the character needed.<br /><br />Plot wise, it's simple.  Stark is captured and forced to build a missile for a terrorist group.  He rebels in his own way; he builds a suit of armor from the pieces in order to escape.  Since he realizes the weapons his company makes are being stolen by or sold to the enemies, he announces a halt on all weapon producing industry.  He starts working on his own project of creating a suit of armor based around his heart supporting energy source.  At first, he just wants to fly.  But then incorporates weapons to take out the terrorist group.<br /><br />Director Jon Favareau deserves a lot of credit for balancing the serious with the brilliant with the humorist on this one.  Iron Man is one of the best Superhero movies ever to be made and Downey makes Stark his most entertaining character to date.</p></body></html>

Surely this film, "based on a true story," would be just the ticket.  Just kidding, we all knew this was going to be silly hokum from the get-go.  I didn't believe this "true story" as a book, I didn't believe it as a film almost 30 years ago, and I haven't lost any brain cells since then.<br /><br />So the best I can say about the remake of "The Amityville Horror" is that it's less than 90 minutes.  OK, maybe that's harsh--I didn't hate this movie as some people did.  It just barely registered at all.  I suppose there is some suspense in the final moments, that's more than some movies.  But since none of the characters are developed very well, it's hard to work up much interest.  I suppose it's nice to see Ryan Reynolds in something other than an idiotic comedy.  Of course, that would be more interesting if he actually had the talent or presence to do anything more serious.<br /><br />Here is the insurmountable problem.  The movie plays much like "The Shining," and yes, I'm being generous with the comparison.  But in "The Shining," the family couldn't leave when things started spiraling out of control.  They were trapped and isolated, they had to play it out.  In "The Amityville Horror," that is not the case.  The house is so inherently evil--everyone knows it.  The real estate agent sees spirits, the priest is chased away, the little girl almost gets killed, a baby-sitter is driven insane--and yet it never occurs to someone that maybe they should leave.  My favorite moment comes at the end (possible spoiler) as the family looks back at the house from the boat.  The husband has seemingly snapped out of his homicidal rage and is free from the house's influence!!!  Yea!!!  But I couldn't help thinking--Man, maybe they should have gone out to eat more often, shopping, whatever--if that's all it took to break free.  "Honey, I'm going to pick up some groceries.  I'm starting to feel like I want to murder the kids.  See you in a few."  KGHarris, 10/06.</p></body></html>

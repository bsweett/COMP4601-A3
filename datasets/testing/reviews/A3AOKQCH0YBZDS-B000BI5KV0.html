I'm still wondering how the cinematographers were able to capture all the footage they did of the Emperor Penguins, especially the underwater scenes with the Emperor Penguins searching for food!<br /><br />If you love both documentaries and animals, then this is a must see film! This is a great family film and can be watched by all age groups! Morgan Freeman narrates and does a fine job of it. The script for the documentary is really informative about how thousands of Emperor Penguins make their annual journey to their breeding grounds in Antarctica. Each winter the single file, 70 mile journey begins, where by the Emperor Penguins travel through  extreme climate and frigid temperatures just to find a mate, lay and care for one precious egg and raise the young penguin to fend for itself. It is an unbelieveable journey not to be missed!</p></body></html>

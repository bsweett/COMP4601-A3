<meta name="summary" content="I WANT YOU...to watch out for Team America"></head><body><p>Wow!  It looks amazing!  I'm certain this is gonna be one the best puppetry films I ever seen since...since...hmm...does anyone know any puppet films that were done here within 10 years?<br /><br />~REVIEW~<br /><br />Originally, this was intended to be a "That's My Bush!" movie (You never heard of "That`s My Bush?"  Only devoted fans have heard of this short-lived sitcom...all 20 of them), but then South Park-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone decided to change its premise entirely and follow the path of Jim Henson.  Thus the two creators produce this off-beat, political action knock-off that is "Team America: World Police."  Whether it was paper animation or live-action, oh hell, Matt and Trey could even make claymation exercise session using a man's unmentionables,  I support and watch whatever wild idea that come out of their demented, creators' flawed minds 100 percent, because I knew it would work to entertain me.  However, in the case of this marionette movie-making experience, this might've change my mind.  This movie didn't entertain me, because it doesn't work.<br /><br />What IS Team America?  It's a "Thunderbirds" rip-off group of young American normies with distinct abilities that goes off against terrorists around the world, while "accidentally" wrecking havoc from the countries by their own actions.  There's Joe, the arrogant action dude with a distaste for actors; Sarah, the  second-only-to-hottest chick with whimsical psychic powers; Chris, the quarterback gun'n jackass; and Lisa, the blonde beauty  on gathering information.  After losing a fellow member in the last battle, the boss of TM recruited an up-and-coming Broadway actor, Gary, to join for the cause.  After much hesitation (and glaring at Lisa more than once), the main character finally agrees to join, and goes on a team mission to find out what the terrorists are planning, and stop them for doing the Big Bang.  Add some hidden love-interests, potty mouths, and a North Korean Dictator as the main villain, this is made for big action storyline goodness...sort of.<br /><br />The story is linear, but I believe that's was intentional by the creators, only the bring in more hysterical chuckles of cruelty (like Matt and Trey has always delivered with their work).  Believe me, this puppet film is more f'd up than that Chinese puppet cinema of gorefest about some warriors finding a sacred stone (Sorry, fanatics, I have not seen "Meet the Feebles").  The writing in "Team America" is so obscene and mature that it has its moment of irksome laughter and upsetting parents.  It's also quite clever, like in the one scene where some celebrities team up to form as an association to stop Team America by the name of "Film Actors' Guild" which can be an acronym as...well, I can't say it here, but it's quirky.<br /><br />This is, by far, one of the best technical-looking puppet films I've seen.  From the well-made human designs to the scenery the movie's lo-cals are, I was impressive by how it looks and how it interacts with things with special effects (explosions, decapitations, etc.)  The beauty of its design, however, comes with a severe flaw to the work in which the creators produced.  Despite its sardonic "no-strings-attached" comedy, the puppets leave A LOT to be desired in the physical humor department.  The best they can do is wobbling around when a battling against enemies like a spastic dancer for CATS, puppet sex (yes, there is a puppet sex scene, and a long one, I say), and vomiting, which was the funniest part in one scene in the film when Gary was drunk and then he threw up...again...again...and AGAIN (Toilet humor, yes, but still effective funny stuff).  Other than those, it wasn't physically over-the-top or breaking new ground compare to Trey and Matt's best work.  And I liked some physical humor.<br /><br />Like South Park: BL&U, "Team America" includes many musical numbers; the pinnacle would be the movie's theme, "America!  **** yea'!"  But unlike that mentioned movie, the songs here aren't completely memorable and they are not going to make me go out and buy the soundtrack.  What bothers me more, comparing to the mentioned movie again, is that "Team America" is so weak to watch.  It's crazy and overkilling on the profanities, and I expected that (maybe too well).  Come on, Trey and Matt, give me something new to laugh at.  Even with the morals and hidden messages the movie subjects, it didn't affect me too much since I wasn't interested.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD: Boring.  I wanted to give it a good grade, I really do; this is from the creators of my favorite show, darn it!  But watching "Team America", to me, is like watching a wooden copy of Matt and Trey's greatest cinema.  I like the production value, but that's all I can say for positives.  Fans of dark puppetry, or a South park fan with curiosity, should try to catch it and enjoy it by its novel idea.  But for fans looking a different taste of gag from what they already saw, watching this dummy movie can make you look like the dummy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An emotionally gripping, intensely human look at the reality of war."></head><body><p>Mel Gibson does it again, moving well above and beyond the "typical" expectations of the war movie genre.  There is not much I can add that hasn't already been said about the story itself.  I would just say that the great strength of this film lies in its focus on the soldiers as real people, with real lives, real families, real personalities, etc.  Gibson did an excellent job of emphasizing the emotional and psychological trauma of war, both for those in the battle and those waiting at home for news.<br /><br />This production was gritty, realistic and hard-hitting, similar to the Private Ryan/Band of Brothers standard for graphic portrayal of war violence.  Actors like Gibson, Kinnear, and Moore gave extemely believable performances, with Harris Pepper's character only marginally less convincing.  Finally, I enjoyed the absence of political commentary or moralizing about the war overall.  The only criticism that came across was directed toward the military leaders who put the 7th Cav. in that position in the first place.  Beyond that, Gibson just told it like it was.  Very well done indeed.</p></body></html>

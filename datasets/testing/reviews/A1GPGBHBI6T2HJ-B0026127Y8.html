<meta name="summary" content="Liam is the next Jason Bourne...? Very possible..."></head><body><p>I simply did not think this would be as good as it was--and I have NO idea why I thought it would be that way, but I was wrong--BIG TIME. I like Liam Neeson, but putting him in the same category as Jason Bourne, James Bond or Jack Bauer? I don't think so...well guess what? Liam was awesome as a father bent on undeniable, raging vengeance after his one and only daughter is abducted shortly after arriving in France.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes of the movie sets the stage for what follows, and when the rubber hits the pavement, man oh MAN hold ON! We see all the behind the scenes set-up you'll need to accept Liam as a divorced father who spent way too much time away from family, ultimately paying the price as he finds himself divorced, complete with a relationship with his daughter on life-support. He clearly regrets missing out on quality time with his little girl, and attempts to forge a closer bond with her when she deceives him into granting her permission to fly to Europe to tour museum's when its nothing more than a ruse to cover her desire to hop from one country to another seeing one concert after another.<br /><br />When his daughter fails to call him at the appointed time, he desperately tries to get in touch with her, and when he finally does, he discovers that she is moments away from being abducted. He fights back the urge to fall apart and gives her some valuable advice and sets out to find and then punish those responsible.<br /><br />What an adrenaline RUSH. The film quite literally flies by so fast that before I realized it, the movie was over. At first it felt like I had been there barely an hour, but it was longer than that--it just flew by quite rapidly. I seriously doubt that Liam will receive any acting awards for this roll, but I honestly don't care. His acting was superb (as usual) but this type of film is usually ignored at award shows anyway, so no big loss there, right?<br /><br />In short: if you enjoyed or really loved any or all three Bourne films with Matt Damon, give 'Taken' a shot, I believe you will be pleasantly surprised at how honestly GOOD it is. Personally, I loved it, and can hardly wait to see it again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="pointless desecration of the original series"></head><body><p>Let's face it: certain roles are so inextricably entwined with the actors who made them famous that it becomes almost blasphemous to envision any other performer ever taking over the part.  Judy Garland as Dorothy, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie, Lucille Ball as Lucy Ricardo - these are just a few of the many characters one would find unimaginable in the hands of any other performer (just look what happened when Vince Vaughn tried to usurp the role of Norman Bates from Tony Perkins a few years back!).  High on that list would certainly be Inspector Clouseau, the bumbling, befuddled, utterly endearing character embodied by the divine Peter Sellars in no fewer than five films beginning with the first "Pink Panther" in 1963 (a film in which Clouseau actually played a relatively minor role).  But Hollywood is nothing if not consistent when it comes to seizing an opportunity to feed off its own legends to make a quick buck, and so we have this new "Pink Panther" film with poor Steve Martin as the one being called on to fill Sellars' enormously oversized shoes.  The results are not impressive.<br /><br />Actually, as an actor Martin can not really be held responsible for failing to live up to Sellars' standard  - who could? - but he can certainly be blamed for the witless, unamusing script he has concocted along with co-author Len Blum.  The set-ups and sight gags are tired and obvious, and there is far too much reliance on stale double entendres when benign innocence is what is really called for.  The corny reaction shots showing the stupefied responses of various characters to Clouseau's series of epic missteps and societal faux pas deaden the comic timing, robbing the jokes of what little potential they might otherwise have had.  Martin's slurry accent ultimately becomes so annoying and grating that his Clouseau quickly wears out his welcome so that all we are left with in the end is 90 minutes of lame jokes and lowbrow slapstick to somehow try and get through.<br /><br />The "case" - involving the murder of a soccer coach and the theft of the famed Pink Panther diamond in a stadium packed with crazed sports fans - hardly merits reiteration.  Kevin Kline has some fun as a vain police chief determined to rid himself once and for all of his most incompetent detective, but Jean Reno is wasted playing the role of sappy straight man to the buffoonish Clouseau and singer Beyonce Knowles reveals little talent for acting in the two-dimensional role of the dead coach's girlfriend.<br /><br />It's hard to know who to be more embarrassed for - Steve Martin or Peter Sellars - while watching this desecration.  But since he isn't around to defend himself, I'll stand by Sellars all the way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What a mess."></head><body><p>I'm a big Terry Gilliam fan, so the sense of disappointment (nay, betrayal) that I felt watching The Brothers Grimm put me into a deep funk.  There really is nothing to recommend this movie.  The story is a mish-mash, the characters are tinny and weak, the acting is, at best, passable. The whole thing feels like a weak drink, watered-down Brazil with a dash of Tim Burton shallowness.<br /><br />If I had to pick the weakest part of the thing, it has to be the script. It's unevolved, never fully realized, like a amateur's third draft: lacking the life of the first and chock full of bad items that someone thought might make it ideosyncratic.  And it never finds its footing, its tone. It drifts from slightly funny to to mildly strange to loud and conventional.  What makes this all the more disheartening is that the story concept has great potential -- charlatan ghostbusters coming face to face with the real thing.  And this movie, sadly, even borrows from Ghostbusters, with a silly scene involving a character who looks like a chocolate-dipped Stay-Puft? Marshmallow Man.<br /><br />I'll wait for Terry's next film before carving my disappointment in anything permanent.  This movie looks and feels like Terry was asleep at the switch, like he was going through the motions. Like some numb Hollywood committee was at the controls.<br /><br />Here's hoping.</p></body></html>

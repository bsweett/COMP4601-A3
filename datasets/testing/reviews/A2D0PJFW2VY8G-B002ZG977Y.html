There are so many aspiring scriptwriters out there that you'd think Hollywood would have no need to remake classic films or indeed Americanise popular hits from world cinema, I mean where's the originality? That rant aside I approached Clash of the Titans with the hope that it would improve on the original, which has its moments but was by no means a masterpiece.<br /><br />Both Clash of the Titans films are very loosely based on the Greek myth of Perseus, slayer of the gorgon Medusa who also saved Princess Andromeda from being sacrificed to a sea monster. The film actually opens with some background to the myths that told of the Titans that were overthrown by their sons, three brothers Zeus (Liam Neeson), Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston). While Zeus became ruler of the heavens and created mankind, Poseidon took charge of the oceans leaving a Hades (tricked by Zeus) as reluctant ruler of the Underworld. The film switches to the tale of Perseus (Sam Worthington) who is found by a fisherman, Spyros (Pete Postlethwaite) in a floating coffin at sea when he is just a baby. Spyros raises the child as his own and when Perseus is grown up he faces a fight for his own survival and that of the kingdom of Argos that foolishly renounces the gods. Zeus turns to Hades for help and the god of the Underworld insists he will release the feared Kraken to destroy Argos in ten days unless they sacrifice Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). Perseus becomes the leader of a quest to find the means to destroy the Kraken and save Argos from the retribution of the gods.<br /><br />Having appeared in Terminator Salvation (2009) and Avatar (2009) recently it seems Sam Worthington is drawn to the potential box office hits and in Clash of the Titans he gets to traverse the ancient historical path of Russell Crowe in Gladiator (2000). After the background to the rise of the gods to power the film quickly moves onto the mysterious origins of Perseus found in a coffin at sea with his dead mother alongside him. Though the kindly fisherman, Spyros, may have suspicions about the child's origins he raises him as his own regardless and the family continue a seemingly carefree existence. When Perseus is grown up the family are at sea and witness a statue of Zeus being felled along the coast. The culprits are immediately made to suffer when Hades appears and kills the bulk of the soldiers as well as Perseus' family. Perseus is taken to the kingdom of Argos where the ruling monarch King Kepheus (Vincent Regan) and Queen Cassiopeia (Polly Walker) believe Cassiopeia and their daughter Andromeda are superior in beauty to Aphrodite. Having been granted permission by Zeus to bring havoc to Argos, Hades soon appears and begins killing soldiers and ageing the boastful Queen. He realises that Perseus is a demi god and we soon learn of his background as the son of Zeus. Andromeda is then put forward as a sacrifice in ten days otherwise Hades will unleash the Kraken to destroy the kingdom. Argos turns to Perseus for help and a band of soldiers join him on a quest that forms the high point of the film.<br /><br />Aware of his origin, Perseus refuses to welcome his heritage as a demi god, refusing aid that the gods send him though welcoming the advice and support of Io (Gemma Arterton), a woman who cannot age having been punished by the gods after refusing their advances. It is Io that tells Perseus of his origins and helps train him for the difficult encounters on his quest, most notably the fight with the Gorgon Medusa whose stare turns anything to stone but her severed head is considered the best way to defeat and kill the Kraken. Though far from faithful to the myth of Perseus, Clash of the Titans still has nods to many of the Greek tales. In one scene Perseus leads the warriors into the Underworld where they buy passage from the ferryman Charron who takes them across the murky waters to the home of Medusa. The Gorgon herself isn't as fearsome as I recalled in the original, she is portrayed as a beautiful woman here though one that has been cursed by the gods and that serpent tail with matching hissing hair does little to make her appealing. That said, in the 1981 version I vaguely recall that she wasn't as easy on the eye, a more apt punishment for gods jealous of her beauty when she was still human. The battle with Medusa is probably the best bit of the film; the soldiers gathered not heeding the warnings of facing the Gorgon by staring down and not meeting her gaze. The death toll in the exchange is horrific but as per the myth Perseus does triumph in the end.<br /><br />Watching Clash of the Titans I found some moments very appealing, mostly the combat scenes but by the end I was left feeling disappointed. The film isn't particularly faithful to the myth of Perseus. The wonderful winged horse, Pegasus, is encountered by Perseus as a herd of such fine horses rather than emerging from the beheaded body of Medusa while the concluding segment with Perseus' battle with the Kraken doesn't ring true either. It was a sea monster in the myth that Perseus defeated and in the aftermath he married Andromeda. Clash of the Titans has two endings, one appears faithful to the myth but the one I watched was very different. Perseus became a king in the myths but despite his lineage in the film our hero has no desire to be a king or a god in Olympus. There is just enough time at the end for a spot of romance, one that overcomes death, which is always handy but even as the end credits roll you'll be feeling that's a very abrupt way to conclude a film.<br /><br />Clash of the Titans has some good moments but as a whole it's a pretty weak affair. Greek and Roman history is a popular theme for Hollywood at the moment but since Gladiator the standard has been pretty poor and this latest version of Clash of the Titans, sadly, has done nothing to redress that balance.</p></body></html>

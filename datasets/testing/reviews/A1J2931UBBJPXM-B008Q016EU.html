<meta name="summary" content="The &quot;Angels&quot; Take Flight"></head><body><p>In the history of the cinema, most feature films that are the progeny of a successful television series have been less than satisfying or able to capture the essence of the original.  There are exceptions, of course, and "Charlie's Angels," directed by McG (Joseph McGinty Mitchell), and starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, is one of them.  A great movie it is not, but it is fun, the trio of Angels are engaging, and it is non-stop action from beginning to end.  It starts with a dynamic skydiving stunt and never slows down.  Along the way a lot of things blow up, there's music,dancing, plenty of stunts, some clever lines and a bit of comedy relief from Bill Murray (Bosley).  There's just enough plot to keep things interesting, but it really doesn't make much difference; this is like a party to which everyone's been invited, and Angels Natalie (Diaz), Dylan (Barrymore) and Alex (Liu) are everything their T.V. counterparts ever hoped to be and more.  This is the way Charlie's team was meant to be.  What really puts this movie over, though, is the Angels themselves; there's a natural camaraderie between them that seems sincere and never forced, and they all seem to be having a great time, especially the charismatic Diaz, who could easily win an Oscar for Best Supporting Smile.  Barrymore looks good and exhibits plenty of spunk, as does Liu, who has a captivating screen presence as well.  It's all played pretty much straightforward, there's no attempt at parody or heavy drama, and nothing is taken too seriously, which enables the story to move along without getting bogged down with any unnecessary business.  Murray is used just enough to make his presence welcome and effective, and he makes his Bosley fit nicely alongside this latest incarnation of Angels.  The action sequences are well done and the choreography (by Cheung-Yan Yuen) is exciting; the influences of John Woo and "The Matrix" are obvious, and the less experienced McG was wise to draw from the best, for it adds to the success of his film.  There's something of the James Bond films in here, and "Mission Impossible 2" (of course), but to McG's credit, it mainly plays like an extended, more detailed version of the original series.  The supporting cast includes Tim Curry (Roger Corwin), the versatile Sam Rockwell (Knox), Kelly Lynch (Vivian Wood), Tom Green (Chad) and, in smaller but effective roles, Matt LeBlanc, Luke Wilson, and Crispin Glover.  The familiar voice of Charlie is once again supplied by the man who created the original, John Forsythe.  There's so much energy in this movie you get the feeling that the Angels must have always started their day's work with a triple from Starbucks; it's a high voltage romp that's upbeat and filled with fun and positive vibes.  In the end, "Charlie's Angels" is an entertaining, feel-good  movie that should satisfy a new, younger audience, as well as those with fond memories of the show that started it all a generation ago.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray version of the Criterion presentation of "The Third Man" (1949)"></head><body><p>This is one of those films that everyone thought he/she saw. This is of course because of all the popular actors and directors.  Of those viewers that have seen this film they will never forget.<br /><br />The default version is the U.K. version. However, you can see the different versions compared on the DVD extras. Speaking about extras, one of the best extra  is that of the abbreviated play being read voice-over the film.  I defiantly ordered the book.<br /><br />This film is presented in black and white.  You can see how tight the presentation is without a wasted word or glance. The Music is also one of the main characters of the film.  I only remember the Blu-ray version so I cannot tell the quality of the other versions.<br /><br />Even though the book looks from the view of Major Calloway (Trevor Howard in the film) and the film from the view of Holly Martins, it is the character of Sergeant Paine (Bernard Lee) that we find endearing.<br /><br />Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) an out of work novelist (Westerns) is offered a job in post war Vienna by his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). When Holly arrives he finds he is late for Harry's funeral. The authorities are besmirching Harry's memory. Harry's girl (Alida Valli) after hearing of a mysterious third man at Harry's car accident suggested that Harry's death may not have been an accident.<br /><br />Now it is up to Holly to clear Harry's name. We may be in for a few surprises.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HT3QBE">The Fallen Idol - Criterion Collection</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ambitious to an extent that most fail to realize"></head><body><p>Now I am by no means a Star Trek Devotee, but I have seen many episodes of the original series and the movies as well. The first film I recently saw again and my attention was drawn to several things.<p>First, I often hear this film trashed in sci-fi circles. This movie is like a combination of the original series and 2001: A Space Oddysey. That was the intention. After the success of Kubrick's film, Star Trek wanted to recapture some of the wonder and magic that Kubrick's film stole from it. It does, at least in the special effects department, rival Kubrick's film, and there is a scene that sports space suits similar to the ones seen in Kubrick's film. Also, the similar plot device of humans put in danger from a mechanical device helps to prove this. But 2001 was a story of humanity, an epic drama that transcended sci-fi and became a purely philosophical exercise. It helped that the film left ambiguity so that viewers could find a bit of themselves in it. That is the wonder. <p>What we have here is a film about exploration. Star Trek: TMP primarily occupies its time with beautiful and elaborate special effects shots intertwined with segments onboard the Enterprise. There is much underrealized content, such as Spock's being rejected by his people, Deckard's bitterness at losing what was rightfully his command, Kirk's struggle to regain his feeling of unity with ship and crew, Bones having to leave the life he enjoyed because of his devotion to an old friend. But much is explored as well, such as loyalty, honor, devotion, friendship, and the unknown. Although it's not at all a classic film, like its sequel, it is an interesting transitionary film that kept enough to remember why we liked these people on the original series and still lays the groundwork for the epic sequel that is universally renowned as the best.<p>In spite of its underachievement, it is a watchable movie that carries a message on dehumanization and the evolution of technology, just as 2001 does. Eye-candy and witty observations on society make this a recommended pick for sci-fi fans.</p></body></html>

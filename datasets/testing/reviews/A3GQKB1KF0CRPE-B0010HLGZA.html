<meta name="summary" content="Only the Grinch would not love this movie!!"></head><body><p>The best Christmas tale ever - evident by Ted Turner running it for 24 hours straight the last two Christmases.<p>But don't let that stop you.  To see the real story of the Christmas story you need to see this on DVD and all its Red Rider Beebee gun glory.<p>The cast is superb, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood.  It is fond remembrances, without the overly cutsie pie touches.  The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.<p>I love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book.  To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other.  Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.<p>Every family should have this.</p></body></html>

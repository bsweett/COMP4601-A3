<meta name="summary" content="A Great Cold War Thriller"></head><body><p>Based on the Richard Condon novel, written by George Axelrod, directed by John Frankenheimer and starring a terrific cast: Frank Sinatra as Maj Marco,tortured by nightmares of an incident he can't remember except as a strange ladies garden party, Lawrence Harvey as a supposed war hero who has been brainwashed to be an assasin when the trigger is used (a little game of solitare) and Angela Lansbury as the most evil mother in the history of movies.  One of the first martial arts fights in American cinema takes place between Sinatra and Henry Silva.  James Gregory plays a McCarthy-like senator who is being manipulated behind the scenes.  A film from another time but still a real tense thriller.  Highly recommended to one and all.</p></body></html>

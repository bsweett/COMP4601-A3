I believe he's one of the main reasons why people watched this movie.<br /><br />- As for character developments, there was a little bit but not enough to make it a meaningful movie. For example the love between Wolverine and his wife (Lynn Collins) is only briefly depicted. The relationship between Wolverine and his brother (played by Live Schreiber) shows good contrast and conflict. It gives me something to think about. It makes the movie a little deeper than it looks. Live Schreiber is convincing and looks scary as the main villain.<br /><br />- In short, this film is absolutely worth watching</p></body></html>

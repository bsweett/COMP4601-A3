<meta name="summary" content="Choppy story flow of an otherwise great man"></head><body><p>There is a myth and legend that when Julius Caeser saw a status of Alexander the Great, he broke down and cried because Alexander had conquered the world and Caeser had accomplished nothing in his lifetime.  That was Caeser's turning point, and another great man was born.  Alexander would emerge from Macedonia, never to return to his homeland, to conquer 90% of the known world, crush and kill all his enemies, and die at the ripe old age of 33.<br /><br />This movie, however, fails to deliver the most pleasing portrail of this war hero.  We see those who were supposed to be the great influences in his life, namely his mother and father.  Angelina Jolie, who is usually the lovable vamp, comes across in some odd Russian accent.  Her love for her son is obvious, but her marriage to Val Kilmer is anything but happy.  She is adament that her son will become a great man and a military leader.  His father is a drunken slob who doesn't seem to care much for him, as he is a reminder of his marriage to Angelina.  As he grows, his love of miltary grows, and he eventually leaves home to conquer the world.<br /><br />So why is this movie bad?  It's bad because of the jumpy, choppy editing.  We are flashing back and forth too much from his childhood to adulthood.  Many were bent out of shape about the obvious love between him and Jared Leto, but guess what?  Homosexuality was celebrated among ancient Greek culture, and is today!  It was all told in flashback, and it became just plain annoying.<br /><br />If you're looking for a history lesson, it's annoying because the story does not run smoothly.  And Colin Farrell?  It's a little ironic that the woman he married has a resemblence to the woman in his illicit sex tape.  He's an alright actor, but he's a rude, drunken slob and I can't get past it.  Alexander would be flipping over in his grave.</p></body></html>

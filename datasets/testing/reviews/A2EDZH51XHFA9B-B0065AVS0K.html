A lot of people already do, actually, judging by the reactions of the crowd coming out of the theater where I saw it Friday. Yet only three days after its release, it sits (as of this writing) at #112 on IMDB's Top 250, and at least a smattering of critics have praised it. So there are at least a few people getting it.<br /><br />Sin City is old-school film noir. If you're not a big fan of sitting in arthouses watching revivals of old Joseph Cotten films that were just discovered in vaults after being undisturbed for sixty years, you're probably not going to get terribly much out of it. Much of what the critics have criticized in the film, especially the shallowness of the characters, is very much in the style of traditional noir, and as such seemed to me to be strengths, and not weaknesses, of the film. Think of Sin City as an homage to Billy Wilder as much as graphic novel adaptations, and it'll make more sense.<br /><br />All that aside, the one thing the critics have agreed on is the style. And what style it has. Sin City is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen in the past decade-- certainly since Begotten, back in 1991. Unlike Begotten, which struck the viewer with its continuing unwillingness to give you a complete picture of what was going on, Sin City revels in clarity. While much of the film's violence is rendered in cut-away drawn shots, as opposed to the live-action carnage one expects from Rodriguez, the sketched-out scenes paradoxically heighten, rather than mask, the brutality. (Don't worry, boys, the nudity is all real, even if it doesn't include Jessica Alba.)<br /><br />From the standpoint of the plot, your best bet is probably to think of Sin City as Pulp Fiction on steroids. Rodriguez juggles the plots in roughly the same way Tarantino did in Pulp Fiction, but without as much parallelism. There's really not much to say about the plots; this is noir. Plot is secondary to style. There are plots, however, rest assured.<br /><br />To try and cover all the actors in this film worth mentioning would take a thousand words in itself. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Nick Stahl head the list for the macho component, and Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, James King, Carla Gugino, Brittany Murphy, and Alexis Bledel get the top billing for the ladies. And I've just scratched the surface. There is a huge amount of starpower in this movie. (When Josh Hartnett and Nicky Katt are that far down in the credits, you know most of the film's budget was spent on the actors, right?) For the most part, the actors do their thing with liveliness, though there are a few stumbling blocks in the road. The biggest of these is Michael Madsen, which came as quite a shock given that only a few months ago I was praising him to the heavens for making Kill Bill vol. II such a pleasurable experience. A number of parts are overacted, but once again, it's expected in noir. Mickey Rourke, especially, chews scenery in a way that hasn't been seen much since Charlton Heston stopped being a rugged male lead.<br /><br />Simply put, you'll either love it or hate it. How did you feel about the original version of The Desperate Hours? If, like me, you thought it was both William Wyler and Humphrey Bogart's best work, you're probably going to get a real kick out of Sin City. If you thought it was boring and overacted, well, you get the idea. Me, I'd sit through it again right now, if I weren't sitting here writing reviews. ****</p></body></html>

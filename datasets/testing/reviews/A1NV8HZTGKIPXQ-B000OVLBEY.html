Now that I have and I have seen the movie, I am not eagerly anticipating more of it. That being said, the movie is pretty watchable and it looks good. It certainly isn't a benchmark for film or for comic book superhero movies. Marvel movies really aren't either. Spider-Man 1 and 2 are about it. Ghost Rider is the kind of cotton candy/popcorn movie that is easy to swallow, but is instantly forgettable once it's over. Nicolas Cage stars as Johnny Blaze, an Evel Knevel type motorcycle daredevil. Years ago, when Johnny was little, he made a deal with the devil after a close personal tragedy. The devil is Peter Fonda. Pretty fun casting really. Jump forward a number of years and grown up Johnny(Cage) is a much loved daredevil star. He knows what is keeping him alive and what has saved him from his jumps over the years that would of killed anyone else. One day, the devil comes to call. It appears Mr. Satan needs Johnny to pay his debt and become the Ghost Rider, a leather clad, fire lit skeleton with his nasty bike and chains. He needs the GR to track down and destroy an evil power that is loose on earth. Pretty standard stuff really. The movie has a fun cast, but they are not all up to the challenge. Nicolas Cage is Nicolas Cage, and even if the movie is awful, he is usually still watchable and interesting. He seems to kind of be sleepwalking thru the role, but he loves this stuff, so he was probably having fun. Fonda was interesting casting, and even tho he doesn't really have much to do, it's fun seeing him. His introduction and "far out" line was pretty good. Sam Elliot is always good. He has that voice, and you pay attention when he is on screen. Too bad he wasn't in a better movie. The worst of the lot was Eva Mendes. She is a raving beauty, but she seemed a little stilted in places, and some of her acting and delivery were a bit odd. Wes Bentley has nothing to do but be predictable, cliched evil. The writing is not very sharp, and some scenes and bits of dialogue tend to veer into total cheese territory, especially at the end with Cage having his final words with Fonda. Elsewhere, the movie looks great. The make-up and special effects are all fine and lots of fun. It is far from a perfect movie(did anybody think it would be anything else?), but Ghost Rider has it's simple minded entertainment to it and it's easy to watch. Hey, you might even enjoy it, but it will leave your memory, probably never to return, once the credits start to roll.</p></body></html>

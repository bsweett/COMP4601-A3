Forrest Gump is a simply Alabama mamma's boy, with a 75 IQ. He befriends Jenny, who he soon sees as the love of his life, becomes a football star, and so on and so frth through history. In fact, it turns out that Gump has been involved in just about everything from American history from 1950-1980. Its a fun movie, with help from a great performance by Sally Field as Gump's mother, and another one from Gary Sinise as the disabled Lt. Dan. There's some great visual effects, and its a fun movie with a little bit for everybody.</p></body></html>

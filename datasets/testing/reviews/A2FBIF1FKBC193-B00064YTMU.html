<meta name="summary" content="Foxx and Cruise ..... what a great action movie ...."></head><body><p>Both actors certainly outdo themselves in portraiting ... I wonder how that word is spelled anyway .... two completely disparate charcters that have depth and sympathy to the audience .....<br /><br />Tom Cruise as the contract killer manages to get the viewer to feel some level of empathy because of the way in which he treats Max (Jaime Fxx) the taxi driver who is hijacked into driving him around the city while he carefully, and very violently, kills all the witnesses in a drug/gang trial..<br /><br />The story is interesting enough to keep your interest and the charaters a multi dimentional ... Great movie .. I loved it ...</p></body></html>

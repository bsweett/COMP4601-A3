Portions of the film are truly outstanding and well worth note, while possibly a  greater number just do not live up to expectations.<br /><br />The tale begins in 1935, with a creative young Briony Tallis writing a play to be performed that evening on the return of her brother, Liam.  The sheltered young girl misinterprets a series of events and through her youth and arrogance gives false testimony against a young man, sending him to prison for 4 years for rape, and later to Dunkirk with the British Army as was commonly done as an early parole.<br /><br />The story focuses primarily on Briony's grief as she realizes that she's given false witness and what the real cost of this testimony brought to her family.<br /><br />The tale is told in a mix of flashbacks, flash forwards and a scene which literally moves backwards.  While the time shifts are interesting artistically, the sussurus of whispers from the audience of the show I attended indicated I wasn't the only one asking my seatmate, "Where the heck are we?"<br /><br />Much of the filming was stunning, but the music was far too heavy-handed and didn't at times enhance the scenes it played a role in.<br /><br />"Atonement" got bogged down in WWII in the telling of the tale.  While many of the battle scenes were very well done--were all of them necessary?  Much of that material made the film seem more like a war story than a character exposition.<br /><br />Briony Tallis failed to capture my sympathy or interest at 13, (Saoirse Ronan), 18 (Romola Garai), or 60-ish (Vanessa Redgrave).<br /><br />Cecelia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie (James McAvoy) were the standout performance through the whole show.  Every action seemed to speak their passion for each other. Their sex scene in the library was not the most showy, but the subtlety of the actors' words, movements all bespoke a far deeper passion than they even showed.  And they never gave up hope--even while Robbie was at Dunkirk in one of the bloodiest battles in history and Cecelia was in blitz torn London, it seemed they still believed every day they would return to each other.<br /><br />The film was not quite worth matinee fare or coming out to get wet on a cold, rainy day.  What I probably will remember most from this production is the snafu when three women lost their umbrellas in the theatre.</p></body></html>

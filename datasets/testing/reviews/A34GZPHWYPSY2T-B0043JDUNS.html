Sadly, this film is a disappointing Ny-quel, and barely ranks up there with the TRANSFORMERS. In this oddly paced and virtually uninteresting oeuvre, Tony Stark is hogging the screen in an annoying way, but even worse is the I'm-totally-stupid-live-on-CNN kind of air.<br /><br />That tends to stink up a film really quickly for me, anyway. I presume there was supposed to be a storyline about Stark "privatizing world peace" and the decay in his body from the heart-plug. Jeez, call me a purist, but I can't see this happening to good old Iron Man at this insane level. And having a character 'rate' Tony Stark as a narcissist doesn't help. Downey is barely earning his paycheck here, simply by showing up--not a good sign.<br /><br />I hope he doesn't do that in SHERLOCK HOLMES 2....<br /><br />This film had ZERO humor in it--did anyone else notice that? The first film was 100 times better.  Scarlett Johansson was literally a YAWN, which, to me, she usually is. Her squeaky little girlie appeals have no effect on me whatsoever, though I thought the action scenes were well executed. (I'm sure that isn't her in those scenes.) Samuel L. Jackson and the usually impressive Mickey Rourke were sad afterthoughts the way they were presented here, and...Sam Rockwell??...what the hell??<br /><br />Don Cheadle always cheers me up, and here he is a class act as well. So, uh, someone tell me again why does he act like a complete blow-hole to his friend Tony Stark?--anyway, good to see him and Mickey Rourke (who does a brilliant Russian, by the way).<br /><br />Most interesting to me, ignored for the most part of course, was the appearance and significance of Tony Stark's father, Howard (a guy I always liked, John Slattery). He's half Howard Hughes, half Walt Disney (amazing how these three resemble one another). So of course he gets a few seconds onscreen and...what was I even saying?<br /><br />And that is how you'll feel after you've seen this: like you're either getting Alzheimer's, or else you just don't get it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Big Question?"></head><body><p>Any sci-fi buff well knows the exalted place "Forbidden Planet" holds in the history of film.  Ground-breaking effects work.  Costumes.  Matte paintings.  The legendary scenes of the Krel (sp?) power generating machines.  The Krel brain booster, apparently set up for a being with multiple appendages.  The one appearance of the lion-like "Monster From the Id" in the electrical fence while being bombarded by neutron-beam weapons.<br /><br />The one question that anyone who has seen this masterpiece has over the 50 years since the film's release is:  What did the Krel really look like?  The film provides only inferences:  The aforementioned brain booster.  The triangular doors.  The mystery of the appearance of the Krel is a primary aspect that separates this film from all others in the 1950s-and the modern age for that matter.  How many SF films can you name where a character as significant as the Krel makes no visual appearance whatsoever?  The only one I can think of in a similar vein is Universal's "The Invisible Man", but Claude Rains is visible at points in the film.<br /><br />"Forbidden Planet" is really about the mysterious Krel, who were so advanced technologically they were able to gain control over the very essence of their material bodies.  The mystery of why they left no record of their physical appearance only makes the irony of their destruction by the evil of "The Mindless Primitive" within even more interesting.<br /><br />The advent of CGI seems to have all but erased this type of mystery from today's films-to moviegoers detriment.</p></body></html>

First, you have the film noir.  This is a genre that is VERY hard to get right, especially in this generation.  All too often directors want to be super literal when attempting this fare and it becomes a technically proficient but emotionally stunted work.  The era thing is a deterrent because the 30's and 40's were so rich with this coolness that aided in fleshing out rather stagnant approaches to filmmaking.  That is hard to come by today because the approach to acting is so different.  When you take actors used to heavy emoting and make them scale backwards they lose the cool and come across dull and empty.  But, there have been successful takes on the genre, even in recent years.  Second, you have James Ellroy, who has written some of the best crime novels ever and when you factor in the adaptation of `L.A. Confidential' (a beautiful harmony of modern flare and nostalgic noir techniques over a canvas of brilliant performances) I was really excited to see this unfold.  Then you have Brian de Palma.  I'm not the biggest fan, but fear is an ally of his and he has worked some magic in creating tense situations that simmer just right; and this premise was in dire need of a hand adept at creating the right mood.  Fourth, and not least, is the Scarlett Johansson effect.  I'm drawn to her, not just because she is gorgeous but because her actorly antics are alluring in themselves.<br /><br />So I had four very promising reasons to see this film.  Sadly, none of them worked; like, at all.<br /><br />First, I'll start with the obvious.  Like many a critic has noted, Scarlett Johansson probably puts in her worst performance to date here.  She is atrociously out of her comfort zone and while she tries really, really hard, it is embarrassing to note how poorly she attempts to emote so quietly.  UGH, this is coming from the same girl who should have won an Oscar for subtle emoting in `Lost in Translation' and yet she was so caught up in trying to find the style in this genre that she fell on her face; hard.  That leads me to the rest of the cast, who were uniformly terrible (aside from Mia Kirshner and Fiona Shaw).  Hartnett is an actor I often defend because I like him, but by god was he boring as all get out here.  Eckhart had some nice moments but he flew so far over the top in scenes it was hard to take him seriously. And don't even get me started on Hilary Swank.  The idea that she looks like Kirshner was hard enough to swallow (let alone the fact that she was trying so hard to skew young and yet she has old man hands that are mugging up the whole screen) but she just couldn't get the seductive angle right to save her life.  Why didn't they get Jennifer Connelly for this part?  The whole movie I was thinking "that dead actress looks just like Jennifer Connelly".  I never once said "wow, she and Swank could be sisters".  That brings me to the script.  As some have already mentioned, this veers to far from the initial murder storyline and becomes a soap opera of sorts (and uninteresting one at that, since the actors are so disgustingly inept at being remotely convincing), which takes away from the feel of a James Ellroy novel.<br /><br />True, there is some mood here, but it is ultimately sacrificed by the poor handling of the script and the terrible work with these actors, which I do blame de Palma for.  I mean, a director needs to work with his cast to find a niche, and de Palma basically left these fish out of water to muddle through this nightmare all on their own.  When I said earlier about this genre being taken too literally, yeah, that happened here and to devastating effect.<br /><br />I wanted to love this Beany, I really did, but the best I can say is that the film was pretty, the costumes were authentic and the makeup department went all out with that corpse (truly terrifying).  I can't even praise the score, which was so clich&eacute;d and uninspired I was rolling my eyes during the predictable rise and fall.<br /><br />Oh, but Kirshner was sincerely na?ve and Shaw was deliciously demented; so there is that.</p></body></html>

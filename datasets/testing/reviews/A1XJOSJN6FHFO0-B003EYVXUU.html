Watch out with this film, because that is not what is going to happen.  I noticed in reading other reviews that the word, "Haunting." was used often and I have to say that word does sum up this movie.<br /><br />We meet two young people, Owen  is the first.  He is a young boy whose parents are getting divorced and of course that is causing trauma to him.  He is also having a terrible time in school. He has no friends and has been singled out by a bully whose cruelity has not limits.<br />Abby moved into his apartment complex and Owen soon makes friends with her.  However, Abby is not the normal 12 year old, no she has a terrible secret.  Soon the two become close and Abby shares her secret with Owen and his life changes forever.<br /><br />I am not going to go into the storyline but I am going to tell you that it definitely twists around in ways you cannot imagine. You are taken into the world of a Vampire and than thrust back into the world of a sad young boy and girl. You are never told Abby's past so you wonder how her trip into Hell began.<br /><br />The movie is both dark and mysterious, tender and frightening and left me feeling unsettled as it had no conclusion - only what you presume will be a dark future. Again, not the normal Vampire movie of the past we have grown accustumed to,  but one that  delivers not what you would expect, and perhaps that is what will make this movie a success.</p></body></html>

Martin Scorsese, 127 minutes, based on the novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439813786">The Invention of Hugo Cabret</a> by Brain Selznick) is one of those films that makes me envy the very young, who are just old enough to have been taken to see it by their parents, and appreciate it. They will grow, and in middle age and beyond, will think back on it with nostalgia. And they will watch it repeatedly.<br /><br />It also reminded me of my childhood in a way that made me catch at my breath.<br /><br />Hugo Cabret (an enchanting, old-souled Asa Butterfield) is a lonely boy living inside the walls and the attic of the Paris train station. Having been taught by his watchmaker father (Jude Law) about all things mechanical, and by his uncle (Ray Winstone) to maintain all the clocks perfectly, he lives a lonely, spooked life. He steals his daily food, tends the clocks, and tries to bring an automaton back to life.<br /><br />This clockwork 'android' - discovered by his father in a museum shortly before his untimely death in a freak fire - holds a magical mystery that the boy must unravel. (It is based on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FDGU0E">The Jaquet-Droz automatons</a>, built between 1768 and 1774 and still in working order today.)<br /><br />Set in a shop inside the station is a bitter old man (Ben Kingsley), who sells toys, magic tricks and repairs clockworks. Hugo steals from him regularly, because this man has the parts Hugo needs to finish fixing the automaton. This old man happens to be the legendary magician and filmmaker Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s.<br /><br />I will spoil a little and tell you: the train station is the Gare Montparnasse. Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s did in fact work as a toymaker at that station after World War I. The spectacular derailment scene (in Hugo's dream) is a reference to the famous 1895 derailment at the station - and a reference to the great train crash from one of M&eacute;li&egrave;s' films.<br /><br />This rich, kinematic-cinematic joy will teach you first of all that there is life beyond HARRY POTTER. It will show you colors you thought you'd forgotten and make you feel what you thought you could no longer feel. It will make you laugh and cry. It will become a part of you. Set in the late 1920s, it is rich in visual flashes of our true history: the films of M&eacute;li&egrave;s, movie posters of everything from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Y4MJA">Judex (Deluxe Edition)</a> (see my review) to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNOLGE">FANTOMAS</a> to Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd (famous scenes from their films are featured), the streets of Paris as you've never seen them.<br /><br />You will see Sir Ben Kingsley give his greatest performance since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00190N4E4">Gandhi</a> - and it will make you feel as warm as a mug of hot chocolate to see him in full, glorious action again. Things will puzzle you: who exactly was Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s? (He was very real and you'll see plenty of scenes from his movies.) Did they really make ladies' heels out of repurposed old film? What's the deal with Christopher Lee and Sacha Baron Cohen? - all reminiscent of questions kids ask after seeing a magic show.<br /><br />Trust me, you'll not have seen magic like this too often, and it is a darned shame we don't see it often enough. If only all films were like this - it even gives you the lineage of great magic: Robert Houdin, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s (which leads to the unmentioned Harry Houdini). The ending cannot be spoilt, yet I have a feeling you might know what it is already.<br /><br />Get this. Please, get it and immerse yourself, treat yourself to it. History - and magic, and the history of magic and film - never so easy, so fun or so deep. Even the pointless 3D can be ignored if you fancy.<br /><br />With the delightful talents of Chlo? Grace Moretz, Emily Mortimer, Helen McRory, Frances de la Tour, and Richard Griffiths.</p></body></html>

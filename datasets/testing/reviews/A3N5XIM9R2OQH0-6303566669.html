In the few years since I last watched this movie, I had forgotten how dark and disconcerting it managed to be without any uber-expensive special effects.  Since it didn't have anywhere near the budget of its sequels, the original "Terminator" had to rely on some old-fashioned devices like detail, atmosphere, and characterization.  The second and third installments were certainly solid efforts, but they seem almost sterile in comparison.  This is easily the rawest "Terminator" movie, and all the better for it.  <p>While the screenplay is a model of tightness and efficiency, it's James Cameron's grim vision and stark direction that steal the show.  Nuclear-age paranoia has been a staple of filmmaking at least since "Dr. Strangelove," but the image of the future depicted here is even more unflinching than most.  The L.A. of the 1980's is made to look pretty dark and desolate, but the post-apocalyptic dystopia of 2029 is much worse.  It's a cold, mechanized world, with laser-firing machines roaming around and human skulls littering the landscape in a very nice touch.  And in 1984, man and machine do battle with nothing less than the fate of humanity hanging in the balance.  <p>"The Terminator" is probably most notable for introducing a new entry into the pantheon of legendary movie supervillains with the role that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger into mega-star status.  As the fearless, guiltless, pitiless twenty-first century killing machine known simply as the Terminator, Schwarzenegger cuts a largely silent swath of destruction through 1984 Los Angeles, killing almost everyone unlucky enough to get in his way.  With the square-jawed Schwarzenegger striking a very imposing figure, the Terminator has become an enduring film villain precisely because it's so mechanical and unfeeling.  In one especially chilling scene, a heavily armed Arnold nonchanlantly strolls through a police station, wordlessly shooting up defenseless cops who have no idea what they're up against.  I can't help thinking that the Terminator would've made a great Nazi.  And when its skin gets burned off and it's reduced to a metal skeleton with fiery red eyes and an evil grin, the Terminator is even scarier.  <p>The movie's human characters don't fare too badly either.  If there's one area in which "The Terminator" clearly outdoes its successors, it's emotional depth.  Arnold may be the picture of cool detachment, but the unfairly neglected Michael Biehn (who managed to carve out a decent career himself) turns the future soldier Reese into a tortured soul worthy of Shakespeare.  Everything this guy says and does is intense, fuelled by the horrors that he's experienced and that he knows are coming.  And over the course of the movie Linda Hamilton turns the hapless Sarah Connor into a genuine tough chick, a role that would be taken to its logical conclusion in "Terminator 2."<p>Since this movie the "Terminator" franchise has taken on a life of its own, with Arnold playing no less than three different cyborgs in increasingly expensive epics.  The original still hits the hardest though, precisely because it relies more on writing and direction than the special-effects blockbusters of today (this certainly doesn't just apply to the "Terminator" movies either).  Not to mention, this movie introduced the line "I'll be back" to the national dialogue, for which we should all be eternally grateful.  In this writer's humble opinion, the "Terminator" series decks it out with "Lord Of The Rings" for the title of THE movie trilogy.</p></body></html>

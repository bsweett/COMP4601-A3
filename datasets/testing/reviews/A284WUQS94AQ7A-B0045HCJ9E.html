<meta name="summary" content="Is this Roger Thornhill or Bond, James Bond?"></head><body><p>This 1959 Alfred Hitchcock film was the fourth and last "spy" film that he did with Cary Grant.  The others are Suspicion (1941), Notorious (1946), and To Catch a Thief (1955).<br /><br />I realize that Hitchcock was a close friend of Albert Broccoli (James Bond films)and Cary Grant was the original pick by Albert Broccoli to play James Bond, but the character in this film, Roger Thornhill, reminded so much of James Bond, that I had a hard time trying to convince myself that this isn't a "Bond" film.  I realize that Dr. No (the first Bond film) came out in 1962.  BUT, was Bond's film character patterned on this wonderful movie?  The resemblance is so great, Thornhill even had a martini!<br /><br />Briefly, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a U.S. undercover agent, abducted, framed for murder, nobody believes his story so he's on the run.  He meets a counter spy (Eva Marie Saint) and has one of the longest on-screen kisses with her.<br /><br />This movie has so many great scenes.  Among them are the stabbing at the United Nations (where Thornhill was framed for murder), A crop dusting plane that attacked our running hero (which incidently was the influence for the helicopter scene in From Russia With Love---again, Bond) and the great chase around the presidents' faces at Mt. Rushmore.<br /><br />This film also starred James Mason and Martin Landau.<br /><br />This is one cinema masterpiece!  Watch and enjoy, especially if you like James Bond films, but remember it's not...</p></body></html>

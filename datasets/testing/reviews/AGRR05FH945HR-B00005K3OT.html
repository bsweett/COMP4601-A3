<meta name="summary" content="Mary Poppins re-visited..."></head><body><p>Like Mary Poppins, Chocolat is a classic tale of the transforming power of the Feminine in the face of patriarchal oppression.<p>The absurdly talented Binoche, Depp, Dench and Molina lead a cast made in heaven in this most magical of movies. Even on a simplistic level, this is a gorgeous love story which unfolds intelligently and concludes satisfyingly.<p>Chocolat is also a visual delight and remains one of the most beautiful and well crafted films I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

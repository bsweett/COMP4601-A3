<meta name="summary" content="I want to play a game.  Jigsaw is back, using a bigger trap and extracting more blood than ever!"></head><body><p>As true to the horror genre as the first 'SAW', 'SAW II' brings us back to the bloody depths of Jigsaw's intriguing games and puzzles, where blood is the price you pay for not playing by the rules.  I am as pleased with this sequel as I was with the original, bringing blood and horror back to horror where it belongs.  Hopefully, 'SAW III' will rise from the ashes of this grisly phoenix to entertain horror aficionados again.<br /><br />Detective Eric Matthews has cornered and caught John (Tobin Bell) the jigsaw killer.  Or has he?  When John tells Matthews another game is in progress, and shows Matthews footage that his son has been recruited for the game, Matthews is forced into Jigsaw's nightmare of trying to unravel the clues.<br /><br />The trap?  Several people are locked inside a dilapidated old house.  (The atmosphere of the house is sinister and disturbing, but not as filthy as the bathroom in the original.)  The doors to the house will open in three hours, but the players are already breathing in a poison gas that will kill them within two hours.  The players include Matthews' son Daniel (Erik Knudson) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who previously escaped one of Jigsaw's traps and is forced to play again.  John's tape informs them that there are antidotes hidden throughout the house, one of which is in the safe in the middle of the room they are in.  He tells them they all possess the combination to the safe; that the numbers are in the back of their mind.  Once they figure out what they all have in common, they will know why they are there.  X marks the spot (again).  Let the game begin.<br /><br />Amanda tries to warn her fellow players that she has dealt with Jigsaw's traps before, and that they must follow the rules, but the fear of death and the clash of personalities have the players all running for their own lives.  Needless to say, the house has many lovely traps awaiting our game-players.  We get to observe not only the players desperate struggle to survive, but witness Detective Matthews degeneration into his own madness as he struggles with John's mental games in order to save his son's life.<br /><br />Without the 'whodunit' value of the original 'SAW', the surprise in 'SAW II' comes strictly from the clues of the game, not a 'whodunit' but 'what was the most important clue'?  It is still a puzzle for the viewer to solve, and I will go no further on revealing any hints.  Suffice to say, pay attention, and get ready to be shocked, stunned, grossed out, and gagging with exquisite horror and delight as the blood begins to flow.  Watch for the peek at the original bathroom.<br /><br />I must add, I have never felt so drawn to a psychopathic killer in my life as I am to John.  I would kiss Jigsaw's cancer-withered lips and toes if I could find him.  I just hope he doesn't find me first.<br /><br />One more quick note.  When I saw Donnie Wahlberg in 'The Sixth Sense', I wondered how an awful ex-pop singer (the word singer used loosely) could turn into such a great actor.  While his performance in 'The Sixth Sense' was superior, he plays his role as Detective Matthews quite skillfully.  Kudos also to Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith.<br /><br />If you loved 'SAW', you are going to love 'SAW II'.  If you love blood, guts, building terror, violent deaths, desperately selfish personalities, and cunning killers, this movie is for you.  Definitely a 'buy', 10 stars.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

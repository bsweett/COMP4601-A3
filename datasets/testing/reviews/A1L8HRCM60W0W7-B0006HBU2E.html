I'd say it in fact trumps the first Bourne cameo with a tighter plot, a lower body count, and just as many edge-of-the-seat jolts.<br /><br />The pivotal car chase in the movie tops most in memory, reminiscent of Ronin but set all over the world, from the unfeeling fields of Goa to the narrow streets of Berlin.<br /><br />The villain is unmasked quickly this time round, but this isn't a whodunit; it's a howdunit, keeping us riveted as we watch Bourne stay one step behind a solution and one step ahead of authorities.<br /><br />The action sequences are fascinating, including a very creative deployment of a toaster as a deadly weapon in one particularly thrilling sequence.<br /><br />Top notch stuff!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Sultan of Spin"></head><body><p>Thank You for Smoking sheds light (as it should do) on several important matters, including: how powerful the Tobacco giants and their associate companies have become, the health hazards associated with cigarette smoking, the power of the media, and the hypocrisy of so many who oppose tobacco.<br />The film brings to the screen the story of Nick Naylor, a spin-doctor, as he travels with his 12-year-old son across the country showing him what he does for a living.<br />Aaron Eckhart, Robert Duvall, J.K. Simmons, William Macy, Katie Holmes, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.<br />The setting, the plot, and the dialogues are all good and it does get the message across loud and clear.<br />In short, balanced and fair, Thank You for Smoking, is a movie definitely worth watching, as it is surely an eye opener.</p></body></html>

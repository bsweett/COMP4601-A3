<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected"></head><body><p>In the era of CGI as a substitute for story-telling - an era ironically given birth by this film's predecessor - Terminator 3 is a refreshing departure.  Certainly there are enough explosions, chases, gunfire, and jaw-dropping CGI effects to satisfy the visceral desire for excitement, but T3 also features memorable dialog, a well-constructed plot, and a philosophically satisfying answer to the question of determinism vs. free will posed by the first two films.  <p>James Cameron's lack of involvement with this production is actually a plus: like Steven Spielberg, he can't resist the urge to pull heartstrings by sometimes force-fitting contrived "touching" situations.  Termitator 2 is a terrific movie, but I still wince when Schwartzenegger's T-101 says "I understand now why you cry.  But it's something I can never do."  Some people found that moving.  I just thought it was corny.<p>Director Jonathan Mostow is, by contrast, more even-handed, if less technically astute (Cameron has a degree in physics).  Even the humorous bits ("Talk to the hand", the running sunglasses gags) come off as organic.  He is a skilled action director who doesn't ignore the human aspects of his story, and takes great pains to integrate them seamlessly with the genre tropes we have all come to expect. <p>The performances by Nick Stahl as John Connor (taking over for the troubled Edward Furlong), Claire Danes (radiant as his love interest), Kristanna Loken as the ultimate dominatrix-model terminator, and the ageless Arnold Schwartzenegger are top-notch.  Danes' performance is especially impressive when you consider that she was cast in the film and started shooting with literally no time to prepare.<p>Mostow's take on the story is less about the evil of big corporations like Cyberdyne, than about the destructive qualities of human nature amplified to apocalyptic proportions by our own machines.  For me, that is really the heart of the Terminator mythology, and he hits his target dead-on with an ending that is as poignant as it is surprising for a summer action flick.<p>The DVD is well produced. The extras are mixed, with a so-so making-of documentary, a fairly funny gag reel, and a sleep-inducing attempt at an interactive special-effects lab.  It could have done without most of them.  <p>The reason to buy the film is not the extras; it's the film itself, which, for the completist, belongs without apology next to the first two films on your DVD shelf.</p></body></html>

Where Warner Brothers had no idea how to market Bird's first film, Disney had no problem with promoting his new movie and it was a huge hit. The Incredibles is also the first Pixar film with human beings as the central characters, instead of relegated to the margins. Perhaps they were waiting for computer animation to progress enough to render them convincingly or maybe they were waiting for someone with the right vision to realize them. They found it with Bird who uses his cartoonish style of caricature to exaggerate a character's physical features and body gestures to make them more identifiable to the audience.<br /><br />As is typical with previous Pixar DVDs, The Incredibles is jam-packed with a wealth of extra material. All of the animated menus keep in flavour and tone with the look and feel of the movie, which is a really nice touch.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Brad Bird and producer John Walker. The two men constantly praise their hard-working crew for achieving the look and feel that they strove to achieve. Bird touches upon some of the film's themes and plot points in this engaging and informative track.<br /><br />There is a second commentary track by several of the film's animators. They talk about some of the techniques used in the movie. The strengths of caricature vs. realistic art are discussed and it is pointed out that caricature brings out the essence of a character.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with "Jack-Jack Attack," an animated short film created specifically for the DVD that stars the Parr's baby. It shows us what happened between Jack-Jack and the babysitter while the Incredibles were off saving the world.<br /><br />There are six deleted scenes in various unfinished forms (often animated storyboards) that are individually introduced by Bird who puts each one into context and explains why it was cut. He does an excellent job talking about each scene.<br /><br />The "Behind the Scenes" section includes a detailed Making of Featurette (and a collection of additional footage) that shows how much time, energy and hard work went into making The Incredibles. This featurette covers all aspects, from story to character design to music and even the customary blooper reel.<br /><br />"Top Secret" features a "vintage" Mr. Incredible cartoon that is a spot-on parody of crudely animated cartoons from the `60s. Craig T. Nelson and Samuel L. Jackson even reprise their roles in a mock audio commentary trashing the cartoon! There are also beautifully designed profiles of all the costumed characters from the movie, even minor ones that are only briefly mentioned.<br /><br />"Boundin'" is the animated short film that appeared in front of The Incredibles when it debuted in theatres.<br /><br />The Incredibles continues Pixar's unprecedented streak of box office and critical successes. With each film they have further advanced the art of computer animation and this film is no different. However, Bird brings his own unique vision that separates his movie from the rest of Pixar's canon. It is a refreshing new perspective that features Bird's obsession with the `50s and superheroes. The Incredibles is a near perfect blend of populist sensibilities with an engaging and entertaining story that never condescends to children or alienates adults. Like other Pixar films it will endure because it appeals to people of all ages.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's the chemistry..."></head><body><p>When I first heard there was going to be a sequel to Meet the Parents, I was horrified.  I hated the first one, and had some serious doubts about any sequel being able to redeem.<br /><br />However, with some excellent casting choices and just a better story I'd say this one did it.  If you thought that Stiller's and DeNiro's characters were clashes then wait till you see Hoffman, ex-hippie, and DeNiro, CIA of course, clash.<br /><br />That's where most of the humor lies, although even the stuff that goes wrong this time is more interesting then the last film.  Somehow, they even managed to throw in a few twists.<br /><br />Like I said, I don't know how they came up with an idea that would save the Meet the Parent's idea, but once again all I have to say is good casting creates good chemistry.  And they found the formula.<br /><br />(Sidenote: still inappropriate for younger kids.)</p></body></html>

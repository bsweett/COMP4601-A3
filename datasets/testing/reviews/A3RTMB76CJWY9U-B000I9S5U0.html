<meta name="summary" content="A Great Boxing Movie ( & Period Piece) You Might've Missed"></head><body><p>Cinderella Man is a stylish little biopic about a down-on-his-luck boxer trying to get his family through the Great Depression. He happens on a string of luck which winds up pitting him against the World Heavyweight champion--a boxer known for killing people in the ring.<br /><br />This is a feel good family affair with heart. Crowe is great in his role as is Paul Giamatti. It's also "educational" as it shows a convincing portrait of what living during the Great Depression might really have been like. It helps us to appreciate the simple abundance that we enjoy today. My one complaint might be that some of the boxing sequences were a little overlong/repetitive and that there were one or two slow parts, but otherwise the movie delivered on its promise.<br /><br />Largely ignored in the theater, but this is a good movie and well worth watching.</p></body></html>

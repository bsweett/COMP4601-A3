<meta name="summary" content="Rip Roaring Laughs!!"></head><body><p>I didn't expect this movie to be this funny!  It is hillarious!  Ben Stiller is a hoot as White, the ego maniac.  Rip Torn is classic as the coach of the improbable team.  But what I enjoyed were the cameos by Chuck Norris, David Hasseloff and William Shatner, who seems to have finally shedded his Capt. Kirk persona.  This movie will have you in stitches.  Get ready to laugh you butt off and try not to drink anything while you're watching!</p></body></html>

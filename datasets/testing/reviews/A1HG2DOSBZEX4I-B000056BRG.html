I will attempt to limite my review to the Four Disc Collector's Edition released by Warner Brothers Video.<br /><br />The first two discs present the epic film. The transfer is excellent and the letterboxed widescreen do justice to the Camera 65 original negative. The print quality on this edition is flawless and the Dolby 5.1 mix is very responsive on a good home theatre system.<br /><br />The film discs also contain a commentary by film historian and author T. Gene Hatcher with additional pre recorded comments by Charlton Heston. The commentary is well worth listening to with Hatcher going over the production process and Heston filling in anecdotes on the filming and on his relationship with Wyler and the cast. There is also a music only track which showcases Miklos Rozsa's Academy Award winning score.<br /><br />The third disc contains the 1925 silent version of Ben-Hur directed by Fred Niblo. This version was one of the most seen films of its time. Far from being difficult to watch the film is excellently restored and features a new score by Carl Davis. This film is the equal to the 1959 version and in some ways I think that I may perfer it.<br /><br />The fourth disc contains more standard bonus type features. There are two hour long featurettes on the production of the film: Ben-Hur: The Making of an Epic from 1994 and Ben-Hur: The Epic That Changed Cinema from 2005. Both are excellent features and give some useful information on both the making of the film and its lasting influences on a new generation of filmmakers. There are also stills galleries, screen tests, news reels and trailers.<br /><br />This is the definitive presentation of this classic film and is well worth the purchase price.</p></body></html>

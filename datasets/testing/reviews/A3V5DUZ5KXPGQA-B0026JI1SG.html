<meta name="summary" content="Surprising Film"></head><body><p>I am always suspicious of movies that get Oscar buzz and awards because they are usually the ones that PUT ME TO SLEEP! This one was pleasantly an exception!<br /><br />I don't think any one performance stood out here really. It was all a blend of strong performances put together that made this film work. Clint Eastwood's character is almost a rip-off of the late Burgess Merideith's "Mickey" from the Rocky films only he wasn't ever a boxer, just a corner man and trainer. But, unlike Mickey, there are a lot of underlining issues in his past that he wrestles with throughout the film.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman's character is the "Ying" to Eastwood's "Yang." An ex-fighter who is the reasoning side of this duo who eventually influences Eastwood to train Hilary Swank's character Maggie.<br /><br />Swank's performance as the simple but full of heart fighter Maggie is very good. She carries herself well in most of her scenes and her character's fate takes an interesting and shocking turn! I won't give it away but it'll take you by surprise.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this film. I didn't think I would like it but I did. This is one that's worth the money at full price but if you can find it at a reduced price, take it! Its worth it either way!</p></body></html>

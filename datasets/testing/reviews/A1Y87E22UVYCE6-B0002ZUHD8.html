<meta name="summary" content="Fleshing a Legend."></head><body><p>"King Arthur" (2004) is basing its promotion on the slogan "the true story behind the legend". I don't know if it is the "true" story, but it certainly tries to ground it to reality.<br />It gives Arthur a historical backdrop: when the Roman Empire was collapsing and its Legions were called back, leaving his most distant provinces undefended.<br />In this case Romanic Britain was left without protection from the invading Saxons and from the rebellious Woads.<br />With this structure the movie tell the story of Artorius Castus and his knights trapped in a difficult spot: their service time has ended and they long to return home, but they are forced to accomplish one last mission.<br />Arthur and his friends are depicted as real flesh and bone persons, not perfect heroes. Merlin appears as a Druid not as a wizard full of magic tricks. Guinevere is the daughter of the Woad's Chief. Saxons are starting the endless harassment of the British coast that will continue for more than 500 years.<br /><br />"King Arthur" is a classical action film without very deep or psychological plot. That is not a drawback, the spectator know this and expect only good actions scenes.<br />Well the movie is full of them and some as the battle over ice are great.<br />Actors' performance is correct. Keira Knightley flesh a glamorous warrior woman, Clive Owen is a stern Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd a handsome Lancelot and Stellan Skarsgard a menacing ruthless Cerdic.<br />A good movie for action fans.<br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

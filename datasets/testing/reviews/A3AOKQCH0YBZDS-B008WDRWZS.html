<meta name="summary" content="Treadwell is a Village Idiot!!"></head><body><p>I gave this documentary 5 stars due to director Werner Herzog's outstanding efforts and the pure challenge of putting an accurate and complete perspective on who the grizzly man, Timothy Treadwell, really was. See Amazon.com's editorial review for complete plot synopsis as I don't want to repeat the entire plot line in detail here.<br /><br />Herzog had complete access to over 100 hours of amateur video taken by Timothy Treadwell during his times spent at the Katmai National Park in the Alaska wilderness. Herzog not only uses some of the video footage shot by Treadwell himself for "Grizzly Man", but also intermixes interviews taken of Treadwell's parents, Treadwell's friends and former girlfriend, the coroner who autopsied Treadwell, and the airplane pilot that would drop/pick up Treadwell each year, etc. to give the viewers of "Grizzly Man" a more complete picture of who Treadwell really was.<br /><br />Based on what I saw in this documentary, I think Treadwell is a Village Idiot! Yes, I think it is admirable that Treadwell loved nature and wanted to save the grizzly bears..... BUT Treadwell was an amateur, wildlife activist wannabe with no concrete knowledge about wildlife ecology let along any advanced degrees in biology, zoology, animal behavior etc. before heading off into the woods to live with wild grizzly bears. Let's face the facts here. Treadwell was a college drop, self admitted recovering alcoholic, unsuccessful actor in Hollywood, didn't have much luck with the ladies as he claims, and seemed very angry at society at large, and preferred living in the company of grizzly bears more than with people! Honestly, I don't know how Treadwell managed not to be eaten, mauled, or seriously injured by a grizzly bear sooner than he did. It is very sad that his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, had to die the same gruesome death Treadwell did. What a tragedy.<br /><br />I think the moral of the story here is to leave the interacting and observing of dangerous wildlife to the experts! I don't think it is wise for anyone to go around attempting to pet will animals (especially predators) roaming freely in nature, nor invading there space by approaching them to closely like Treadwell did.</p></body></html>

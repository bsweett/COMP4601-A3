The strange thing for me is that I remembered this as being an older film, like 2000 or so.  Made last year, David Fincher directed this and was nominated for Best Director from Film Critics in Chicago and Toronto.  Fincher's other films include "Panic Room," "Fight Club" & "Seven."  One might expect a bloody thriller, but instead "Zodiac" is an intense drama centered on Robert Graysmith's compulsion to find the killer.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhall who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JOFQ">Brokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)</a> and actually won @ the British Academy Awards plays the role with subtle but growing indications of Graysmith's strength of conviction.  Since Graysmith is a cartoonist at the San Francisco paper, his mission about this case seems to come from left field.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo won a Best Actor Award from the Montreal World Film Festival for "You Can Count On Me" and shined in one of my favorite films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQM4Y2">Just Like Heaven (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  As Inspector David Toschi, he does a good job of bird-dogging the case, but then even he reaches a point where he wants to throw in the towel.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays San Francisco reporter Paul Avery whose arrogance leads him into pursuit.  Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for "Chaplin" and won a Golden Globe for "Ally McBeal" in 2000.  He shows the deterioration of the character into an alcoholic haze.<br /><br />Brian Cox does an excellent job as Melvin Belli.  Anthony Edwards from TV's "ER" plays Inspector William Armstrong who comes to prefer a desk job.  The film is a good psychological study of the main characters tracking the killer.  The final scene where Graysmith goes into the hardware store and stares at the guy he knows did it, but is unable to prove is intense.  The film got Best Picture nominations from Film critics in the Southeast, Las Vegas & Oklahoma.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

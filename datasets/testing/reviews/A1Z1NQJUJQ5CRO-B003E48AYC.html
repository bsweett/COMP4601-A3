<meta name="summary" content="An average entry for Burton"></head><body><p>Alice in Wonderland(released Feb/10)stars Johnny Depp(as the Mad Hatter),Helena Bonham Carter(as the Queen of Hearts),Anne Hathaway as the White Queen,Crispin Glover as the Knave of Hearts and Mia Wasakowska in the title role as Alice.Depp of course has collaborated with Burton on more than a few of his projects and,as usual,Depp steals every scene he is in.I must say off the top that I am no Tim Burton fan at all.He has had some real stinkers like Cabin Boy and Mars Attacks,his animated films do absolutely nothing for me and he usually directs with a very heavy hand,Pee Wees Big Adventure being a prime example;a movie that should have been much better if it had been lighter in tone and faster paced.So to get me to see a Burton film,let alone review one,has got to take some doing.A friend of mine got after me repeatedly to watch this,so I finally caved.I found Burtons heavy hand again and a totally miscast and uninteresting Alice in Mia Wasakowska.The movie only really starts to come to life once she is down the rabbit hole under the tree,before and after is sheer boredom.But I found it interesting enough to give it at least an average mark.<br />The story involves Carroll`s beloved character of Alice here betrothed to a rather obnoxious society Lord.As he proposes in a gazebo under the scrutiny of all at the huge garden soiree,she spies a rabbit and excuses herself to run after it.She finds a large hole underneath of a tree and tumbles into it.After attempts at growing and shrinking she finally enters Wonderland.She apparently has been there before but it takes almost the entire film for her to realize her strange dreams over the years were based on real events.She runs into a plethora of Wonderland characters including Tweedledum and Tweedledee,the White Rabbit,the blue Caterpillar,the Dormouse,The Cheshire cat,the March Hare,among many,many others.What she discovers is this land is ruled by the psychotic Queen of Hearts,she of the bulbous head and deadly swift temper.<br />At one point Alice comes upon a long table at which sits the dormouse,the March Hare and the Mad Hatter.Depp is a master of the exotic and strange in his characters and this is no exception,as he embues the Hatter with the right mix of madness,a marvelous vulnerability and pathos,all wrapped up in a kind heart.Over time Alice becomes mixed up in the ruling Queens court and finds the Vorpal sword which is the only thing capable of killing the Jaberwocky(a dragon like creature),a venture she is destined to perform.She escapes with it to the White Queen,the Queen of Hearts nice sister,who previously ruled wonderland.In the meantime the Hatter has been arrested but he escapes and provokes an uprising against the Queen of Hearts.The resistance,for the moment,is quashed but the `rebels`escape to the White Queen.There they amass,regroup and return in a final epic battle with the Queen of Hearts troops.<br />It is now Frabjous Day,the day of the final battle and the day Alice,with Vorpal sword in hand,and dressed in battle armour,confronts the Jabberwocky.In the end all is returned to normal as the Queen of Hearts and her consort,the Knave of Hearts,are banished from the kingdom.Alice says a farewell to her friends and returns to the ``real`` world above.Little time has passed since she left and she returns to the gazebo,refuses the request for marriage and enters into a mutually beneficial business partnership with her uncle.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and is in its original a/r of 1:78:1.Extras include three featurettes on the making of the film.<br />All in all just an average Burton entry.It would have gotten higher marks if the film had been more interesting in the pre and post Wonderland sequences.Also Mia Wasakowska is totally miscast and a bore as Alice,with little or no life in her portrayal.Depp is the entire show here,along with Carroll`s wonderful Wonderland characters and with Helena Bonham Carter coming in in third place.For Depp fans this is a must.For the rest of us...the usual.</p></body></html>

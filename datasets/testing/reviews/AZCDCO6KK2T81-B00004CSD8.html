<meta name="summary" content="A Must Have Collection for Horror Fans!"></head><body><p>It's great when they package a series of films and this is no exception and that's why I gave it four stars even though each film itself is of different quality; therefore, I gave my ratings below for each individual film.  These were all mostly chilling films and they do what sequels are supposed to do and that is continue a storyline and not keep repeating the original.  Here is my take on each film:<br /><br />Omen (1976) ***** - Still one of my all time favorite films horror or not.  The Academy Award-winning score by Jerry Goldsmith is still very haunting as is the rest of this film.  Time has not altered the effectiveness of this great chiller which is enhance by great acting, notably by Greg Peck and Lee Remick, direction and cinematography.  Nothing shows age with this film.<br /><br />Omen (2006) *** - An unnecessary remake, but a decent one all the same with a good cast.  It does lack the haunting images and feel of the original and probably a good example of leave well enough alone.<br /><br />Omen II (1978) ***1/2 - A well-crafted sequel that cleverly continues the story which is what a sequel should do.  Damien is growing up and learning of his heritage, power, and potential future and unexpectedly struggles with this much like any teen-ager growing up.  The storyline is very convincingly continued here.  It's not nearly as haunting and chilling as the original, but it does stand well up against it.  Superior acting and an intelligent script save this film from being a typical sequel.  While it is predicatable most of the time, the director keeps things moving swiftly.  Good popcorn fun, but with a little more substance than most of its genre.<br /><br />Omen III (1981) **** - The world is introduced to Damien, now an adult and seeking world domination through his company and followers, and we as an audience are introduced to a great actor, Sam Neil (Jurassic Park), in his first starring role.  I was greatly impressed with this sequel and Neil's powerful performance filled with chilling charm and menacing arrogance.  This film got under my skin more the Omen II, but still less so than the original film.  My major criticism with this film is the ending which has several VERY long passages to read at the end in a font and size that is difficult to read.  Thank God for the freeze frame function.  Live audiences must have went nuts trying to read this in the theater and if they missed it, they'd have to stay to see it again to read faster.  Overall, it was a very effective conclusion to the Omen series.<br /><br />Omen IV (1991) **1/2 - Hey, didn't I just say conclusion in the last review?  Well, sort of.  This "sequel" is entertaining to a degree, but it does what all too many sequels tend to do and that is rehash the original and contradict it as well (much like "The Grudge 2").  This film is one of those it's so bad it's kind of good (but not that good).  This is an example of Hollywood trying to save a money-making franchise, but they are fresh out of good ideas to continue the storyline.  Heck, after killing Satan's son in Omen III, that kind of closed the door on things --duh!  It's an oddball film that is mildly entertaining, but very pale in comparison to the series' prior efforts.<br /><br />This whole collection is well worth owning.  I can't imagine any horror fans letting this series slip by them.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rare Sequel That is Better Than the Original"></head><body><p>Bryan Singer's X2 is the rarest of sequels. It manages to be better than the original. This is the movie that comic fans were waiting for. It has action, a message, and a story line that does its best not to insult movie goer's intellegence.<br /><br />The film starts shortly after the battle between the X-Men and the Brotherhood that ended the first film. There has been an attempt on the life of the President of the United States by a strange mutant who teleports. The mutant is the Amazing Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) and he is seemingly under someone's control. The person in control is William Stryker (Brian Cox) who adds another layer to the already complex mix of characters. Stryker is a human who wants to eliminate the mutants and is not above kidnapping Xavier to do it.<br /><br />This film has elements of action, revenge, comedy and even an unresolved love triange. It's impossible to go into much detail without destroying the fun. This is one of the few big budget blockbusters that should be seen. It's a great second feature in a developing franchise that promises much more in the future.<br /><br />The disc that I viewed included two commentary tracks: one with Singer and cinematographer Tom Sigel; the second with the producers and writers. Both tracks were informative and aid greatly in ones understanding both of the comic universe created and the production in particular. A second disc provides hours of extra features on just about all aspects of the production and should serve as a standard on features of this type.<br /><br />See this one it is worth it.</p></body></html>

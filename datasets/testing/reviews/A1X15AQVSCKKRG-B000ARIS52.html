<meta name="summary" content="Pretty awesome movie,see Sin City!!!!"></head><body><p>This was a wham bam thank you mam action film, you knew  with Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Dusk Till Dawn, El Mariachi)  it was going to be pretty good and it was and then some!!!<br /><br />Using the latest in cgi technology and mixiing with black  and white noir layering to emulate that of a classy crime  film, Sin City operates on all cylinders like a fine oiled  machine.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good on all from Mickey Rourke,to Jessica  Alba to Clive Olin.<br /><br />I never even read any of Frank Miller's book but the beauty  of the movie is that you dont have to, though it would help.  I was never really lost with the story and I was able  to connect with all the characters. Overall a great movie!!!</p></body></html>

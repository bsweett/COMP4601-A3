<meta name="summary" content="[Three-and-a-half stars] Even when he's serious, he's still funny!"></head><body><p>Of course here, he can't be 'Carl<br /><br />Spackler funny', but you get the point!<br /><br />Comptuer man (no-no, stop laughing)<br /><br />Don Johnson (no, not the one from<br /><br />Miami Vice) is a self made millionaire,<br /><br />bored out of skull and sitting around the<br /><br />home watching classic movies and waiting<br /><br />for the mail to arrive every day. One day<br /><br />he gets an anonimous letter from one of<br /><br />his former ladies in the past and tells<br /><br />him he has a child, boy, 19, who has<br /><br />run away from her and may be on the way<br /><br />to look up Don. He shows the letter to a<br /><br />neighbor, an eithiopian man named Winston<br /><br />who tells him (Don) that HE MUST find out<br /><br />wether he has a son and by whom. Winston<br /><br />uses Don's credit card and rents cars,<br /><br />hotels, et, al and plans at trip to<br /><br />the cities of the four women who MAY<br /><br />be the mother of Don's child. Murray's<br /><br />character gets more than he bargains for<br /><br />when he goes a-lookin'! And despite some<br /><br />good drama from Murray (the first we've<br /><br />seen since 'The Razor's Edge' remake back<br /><br />in '84 (***), and some laughs, the ending<br /><br />really sucks! I won't give it away but<br /><br />it really disappointed me greatly. A good<br /><br />movie nonetheless. See it with a girlfriend.<br /><br />It beats the horrid 'Broke Back Mountain'!</p></body></html>

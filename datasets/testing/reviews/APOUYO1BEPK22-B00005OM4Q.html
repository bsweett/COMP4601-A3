He's writing a piece on the new up and coming rock band Stillwater for the magazine Rolling Stones. He's going to get to go on tour with them and write about anything he wants about them for the next month or so. First though he has to get permission from him mom (Frances McDormand)... because he's only 15.<br /><br />Before he gets this little gig, he's trying to get an interview with Black Sabbath when he meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), who's not just a groupie, but a Band-Aid. The difference being, she's in it for the music and not the sex with someone popular. Penny is definitely one of those `out of this world' types of girls. Not just in looks, but in her actions as well. She's a legend to the rock bands because she's just so much fun to have around, and she can always light up a room when she steps into it. She tugs on the tendrils of every heart of every man who comes into contact with her. But the only man she truly wants is Russell Hammond.<br /><br />Will is accepted as a friend and not just `the enemy' as usual by the band members of Stillwater. Most notably by Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). Jeff is the lead singer and Russell is the lead guitarist and also heart throb of the group. While Jeff is sort of an open book for Will, it's Russell he's a bit more interested in, mainly because Russ never really gives that interview he's looking for, but more than not just some one liner quotes. As time goes on, we see how the band has some inner turmoil due to Russell's looks. He's becoming the front man of the band when it was supposed to be Jeff, like the plan was. Just like a lot of bands, this one started off great, but slowly, it could be coming to an end.<br /><br />I absolutely love this movie. Every time I watch it I have a big smile on my face almost the whole the time. From the atmosphere to the music to the settings to the parties, everything just makes me happy. Maybe it's because somewhere deep down in me I'm a rock star myself. Sure I can't sing, nor play an instrument (recorders don't count!), but by god I'm a rock star! The whole story is so much fun to watch unfold. Getting to witness the first time William gets to go back stage to the first time he gets to hang out at a hotel party, all the while making sure he calls his mom in the morning to check in, is just so much fun.<br /><br />I actually watched `The Bootleg Cut' of this movie to do this review, and I'm pretty sure it was the first time I ever watched it. It's mostly the same, but more Penny Lane. Those parts were good but there were some parts that I still thought that should've been left out. For instance one scene has Will writing some paper, and his sisters ex comes in his window and starts talking to him about nonsense. It felt very weird and definitely should've been left out. Some scenes I could see why they were left out but were ok I guess. Like a scene that involves Stillwater going to a radio station and doing and interview with a drugged out DJ. It was kind of funny and also a little informative of the situation between Russ and Jeff. But they also left out some scenes. I don't remember them all, but I do remember one. It was the scene where Will is in the hotel room and has some of the girls jumping around him and basically it's left to us, but he has sex with them, which is his first time having sex. They left that out. That was a great scene, so I don't know why it was taken out. Oh well.<br /><br />Also all the actors were great. Kate Hudson was very good, and I love the scene where Will tells her someone sold her for 50 bucks and a case of beer. She starts to cry just a tad, and then asks, "What kind of beer?" and smiles with a tear still rolling down her face. That was awesome. Patrick Fugit was good also, being the nice, sweet, and innocent kid and getting introduced to the life of the rock star.  Jason Lee rocked his part perfectly. He just had that 70's rock band swagger with the long hair flowing and not a care in the world except for his band being awesome. I also liked Billy Crudup and really everyone that was in Stillwater. They just seemed like a real band. So real I'd love to get a faux poster of the actual actors in their get up with a big STILLWATER above them. And Frances McDormand was just phenomenal as the mom of William. You honestly couldn't help love her. She was a great mom, even though a little crazy. You could tell she loved her kids, but was just a little too protective (so the movie makes you think). I actually thought she wasn't that protective though like the movie makes her out to be. Seriously she let her 15 year old kid go on tour with Stillwater to write for the Rolling Stones. At 15 I had to be home by 8pm and 9pm on weekends.<br /><br />It was also fun to see a lot of cameos. Jimmy Fallon (a little more than a cameo), Nick Swardson, Peter Frampton, Zack Ward, Martin Starr, and a lot more.<br /><br />In the end, man I would definitely say own this movie and make it the bootleg edition. That way you can watch both movies versions. I would DEFINITELY watch the award winning Theatrical Version first though.<br /><br />P.S. - The bootleg edition comes with a 6 song EP of Stillwater. I love this CD. `Fever Dog' sounds so good as well as the other songs. I just wish I knew who really sang these songs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not even close to the original"></head><body><p>See my review under, Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, 2pc....................for the younger group, take time, and check out Romeros original,(1978) maybe it will sink in, skip laughing at the clothes or dialogue, just indulge yourself. Now you know why 27 years later people try to redo classics, a quick buck, not even close. Romero is laughing to the bank, he has rights to this gory shootfest remake. He knows who the diehard fans are. Pittsburgh, you rock!!!!!</p></body></html>

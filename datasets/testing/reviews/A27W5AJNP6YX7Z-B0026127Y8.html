Taken was much more serious. Unfortunately, despite the good message it could have had, it was full of too many impossible situations. But in any case, I am glad I didn't see any of these three movies before going to Europe on my own at the age of 22.<br /><br />The father (the former spy) is concerned about his daughter going to Paris. Understandable. He seemed a little over-protective. But he was totally balanced out by the mother who was completely unconcerned about anything and went so far as to help the daughter lie about her plans! "She just couldn't tell him the truth," the poor girl. So museums aren't for everybody. Personally I find sculptures and ancient relics much more interesting than paintings. But I must ask: why would ANYONE travel to a foreign country just to pick up the first hot guy they see and follow a rock band around and go to parties and do other things they could just do at home? Oh yeah, ditzy teenagers.<br /><br />Well, lo and behold, the daughter gets kidnapped, just like the father feared. And she happened to be on the phone with her father at the time. How lucky that he could record the incident! The movie wasn't bad up until this point but shortly afterward all the unbelievable things started to happen. Suspension of disbelief is one thing. But the guy was a former spy, not Superman.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />The father goes to two different places where they are holding girls to turn into sex slaves. Naturally his daughter is not in either. He kills everyone he comes across and never gets one little scratch. Then he starts attacking everyone in his path just to get by them. He shoots this one guy's innocent wife just to get him to talk. He goes on this crazy car chase down the wrong side of the highway. Yeah, risk the lives of another innocent 50 people just to save one. Sorry, that's just wrong. Finally he finds his daughter. She wasn't at the other places because she was one of the special ones who was being sold to an individual buyer. Not just that, but they were "saving the best for last." Gee, what are the odds? Why, exactly? Well, she's American, and speaks English and French. Come on, she wasn't even that pretty. I think he didn't find her until the third place he looked because they needed to make the movie longer. Anyway, they capture the father. But even with his hands tied up, he manages to kill another ten bad guys. Yep, a Superman. So a little more drama, and then they come home, and all of a sudden he has his arm in a cast, even though he killed like 60 people without ever getting a scratch. This could have been a much more interesting story, if only it had been better executed. Or if it had been a superhero movie.</p></body></html>

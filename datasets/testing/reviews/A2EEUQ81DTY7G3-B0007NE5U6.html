<meta name="summary" content="A ridiculous exercise in strained and forced humour"></head><body><p>The first thing that crossed my mind at the end of Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is that I hope that they don't make another one. This is an absolute disaster of a movie - it makes the first one look like an absolute masterpiece. What were Renee, Colin, and Hugh thinking? The first movie was quite delightful - fresh and new, with an energy that exemplified a wholly British sense of humour.<br /><br />But this movie - obviously made to cash in on the first one and on Renee's A list star power - suffers from strained and forced characterizations, a story that goes absolutely nowhere, a rehash of old jokes, and plot twists that strain credibility so much that they become downright ridiculous.  Bridget has unfortunately morphed from plump, kindly, and neurotic sweetheart, to a fat, gross and downright insufferable pain in the neck.<br /><br />This installment picks up a few weeks after the first movie left off. Bridget is still going out with the dashing, adoring, and a tad bit stiff barrister boyfriend Mark Darcy (an embarrassed looking Colin Firth), and she's absolutely wrapped that they're still having "great shags" in the bedroom. But lately Mark has been seeing a lot of Celia (Una Alconbury), an attractive fellow lawyer.<br /><br />The relationship is obviously just professional, but Bridget, with her low self-esteem, and her annoyingly vacillating self confidence, begins to think that she's not good enough for Mark and that Celia is having an affair with him. After all, she's just a tacky television journalist who gets her kicks by skydiving into pig manure, while Mark is a high-flying enormously ambitious lawyer who is out to impress his peers. To make matters worse, the cheeky, rakish, horny, ex-fling Daniel Cleaver (played by a tired looking Hugh Grant), is sniffing around Bridget again, and just itching to get into her knickers.<br /><br />The problem this time around is that Renee plays it so forced and unattractive, that by the end of the film her character just is reeling off a bunch of infuriating stock insecurities. To make it worse the plot is stretched so tight and the story development so desperate; that you know there's a problem when Bridget, accidentally convicted of drug smuggling, ends up in a Tai prison where she teaches her fellow inmates how to sing Madonna songs. It's pretty much the low point of the film, and the scene, rather than funny, is just plain embarrassing.<br /><br />The real hero is probably Mark, who has the stamina and audacity to put up with Bridget's endless round of sitcom antics - from speaking out of place at a lawyers dinner, to falling from rooftops while spying on him, or accidentally bursting into rooms full of foreign dignitaries to make declarations of love. Bridget is just a series of gimmick-driven sequences of musical montages and cheap sight gags. Mike Leonard November 04.</p></body></html>

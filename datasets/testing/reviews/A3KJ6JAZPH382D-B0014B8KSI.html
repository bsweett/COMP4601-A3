<meta name="summary" content="Claytonmation"></head><body><p>Continuing to up his personal ante as a dramatic actor since winning the Oscar for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CMRM">Syriana</a>, George Clooney delivers his latest excellent performance in "Michael Clayton." Clooney plays a bagman in a prestigious law firm, where his duty is to be 'the janitor.' His job is to head for whatever client is in the worst mess and to clean it up with the least amount of residual damage. It's sleazy and he knows it, but he knows he's good at it.<br /><br />But he starts to feel the tug of his moral compass when his best friend (Oscar nominated Tom Wilkinson) has a nervous breakdown while defending a chemical company. Seems he's discovered that U-North is guilty as they get and wants to save the family of the young lady he is supposed to be thwarting. The firm sends in Clayton to rescue the case from impending disaster...but soon he finds himself in the middle of more than he bargained for. Think of it as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXFV">Erin Brockovich</a> with intrigue.<br /><br />U-North is ready to get ruthless, and Oscar winner Tilda Swinton plays the boss of the company with a thin veneer of sweating fear around her tightly controlled executive prowess. The final scene, where Clooney confronts her, is a marvel. The movie avoids pandering and - even at two hours - is tightly edited for the story. If you're looking for a sophisticated legal drama, this is Sydney Pollack at his finest.</p></body></html>

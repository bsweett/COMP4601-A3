<meta name="summary" content="The Edge of Sequels"></head><body><p>Oh how we love to cry "not as good as the first movie", but in truth very few movie sequels capture the freshness, or spirit of an often inventive and new idea like an original. Sadly, that is also the case here when comparing the first and infinitely better Bridget Jones Diary, but there are a few saving graces to make this at least mildy entertaining. The story picks up 4 weeks after the end of the first movie (although 3 years have elapsed in real time) and we find ALL the main characters reprising their roles. Bridget is still oozing the giddy romance and, likeably bumbling naivety of a 30 something schoolgirl, alongside Colin Firth's stoic, but gentlemanly romantic lawyer Darcy, and all seems well despite some nagging incompatibility issues between the two. The clash of class cultures between them continues (albeit in some very contrived scenarios) until doubt, envy and the adjustment of two single lifers suddenly sharing, looks set to send things off the rails. Enter at this point dashing bad boy Hugh Grant as Daniel, stirring up old memories, and mixed emotions, and conveniently now working for the same TV company as Bridget and we are set hopefully for some light entertainment. Problem however, is that none of the engaging aspects of Bridgets character from the first movie, or the concern or sympathy that were previously generated is here, and most of the original cast (nice to see as they are) are just minimally sprinkled in the plot for the purpose of continuity without any real inclusion. I kept asking myself why a sequel was necessary (as I often do, despite the obvious money spinning aspect) when the first picture was so complete, making this a reheating of old material to a large extent. There is enough charm to keep the picture moving, and the characters are all played excellently, but the script is limp overall, some parts being often less than funny completely (especially the Thai prison scenes). The occasional nice dialogue and one-liners try but fail to lift this picture out of the doldrums, and the cringe aspect of most of the embarassing situations Bridget falls into is painful at times. If you liked the first movie, chances are this will amuse you, but it's not in the same league unfortunately. There are some nice extras on the DVD including some funny interviews with the leading characters, deleted scenes, and the usual director comments etc. My best advice? rent before you buy. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

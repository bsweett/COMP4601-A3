But the multi-themed, multilayered movie of the same name, based on a Murray Burnett play originally titled "Everybody Comes To Rick's," well, is the story of people searching for hope in a hopeless world, with mixes of intrigue, danger, the eternal triangle, the rebirth of one's soul emerging out of the chasm of cynicism, and fighting for a broader cause rather than looking out for number one.<p>Amid the teeming masses of those who wait and wait and wait and wait to get their exit visa signed by French police prefect Louis Renault, a corrupt official with a charming air, many of them will go to Rick's Cafe Americain, where there's gambling, dodgy deals, and even an arrest that makes for an exciting evening.  The owner, Rick (Richard Blaine), is an American expatriot who is completely neutral about everything, which is an asset for both the Vichy French and the Nazis.  "I stick my neck out for nobody" he tells Renault, who replies "A wise foreign policy."  However, it's Ferrari, the rotund owner of the Blue Parrot who tells Rick that "isolation is no longer a practical policy."  Renault too shares Rick's isolationist view by telling Major Strasser, a visiting German officer, that he blows with the wind, and "the prevailing wind is from Vichy."  He's just a bureaucrat doing his job, with lots of perks.<p>Enter, or in Rick's case, reenter, Ilsa Lund, with whom he had a whirlwind romance in Paris and with whom he was set to flee before the Gestapo got to him.  Alas, there came "the wild finish-a guy on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides have been kicked out."  Ilsa is here with her husband Victor Laszlo, a Czech resistance leader and key figure trying to unify opposition to the Third Reich.  Ilsa wants to explain about that last day, but seeing what Rick has become has left her disheartened with him.  And Renault is interested in keeping Laszlo in Casablanca, but also in getting some transit papers the black marketeer Ugatti passed on to Rick before his arrest.  Despite Rick's neutrality, he suspects "that under that cynical shell, you're at heart a sentimentalist."  that becomes true when Rick's old wounds are opened, seen all too poignantly when he places his hands in his head.<p>Casablanca is also a place where "human life is a commodity," where the worst elements of humanity cluster, trying to exploit those less fortunate. This is underscored by Ferrari, who swats flies at his place, demonstrating the value of human life in Casablanca.  Casablanca is also a place where the Nazis have outlawed miracles.  However, as things turn out, miracles do not come in the divine sense of the word.  Rather, it is people who become miracles by their actions and convictions of their heart.<p>There are many other characters here apart from Ferrari.  There's the pickpocket, Carl, Rick's waiter and accountant, Sasha, the Russian barkeep, and a Bulgarian couple hoping for their chance at freedom.<p>Although Ilsa's the one that's reawakened Rick's humanity, I'd argue that it's the young Bulgarian girl hoping to get out of Casablanca with her husband and approaches Rick who actually sets him on the road to losing his cynicism.  She asks him "If someone loved you very much that your happiness was the only thing she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her?...and he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart.  That would be all right, wouldn't it?"  That brings into mind the flashback seen, with Rick and Ilsa the epitomy of a couple in the throes of romance, and it's quite a shock to see why he's the cynic that he is.  <p>Parts of this movie have been used in other films.  Bogie's speech to Bergman at the ending of Casablanca has been cannibalized by Woody Allen in Play It Again Sam and in the Red Dwarf story Camille, in a very bizarre way.  But the most effective tribute has been the hit BBC series As Time Goes By, taken from the immortal song from Casablanca, with that as the theme song.<p>All the characters and actors are wonderful, with Bogie at his best, Ingrid Bergman at her loveliest, Claude Rains at his most dapper as Renault, and Sydney Greenstreet pulling in another hammy role as Ferrari.  And this was one of Conrad Veidt's (Strasser) last roles, as he died of a heart attack a year later.  This would have been a totally different movie had Ronald Reagan, Dennis Morgan, and Anne Sheridan played Rick, Victor, and Ilsa.<p>I've seen this many times and enjoyed it more everytime.  What do I do when I'm in the mood for this?  Yes, you guessed it...play it again.</p></body></html>

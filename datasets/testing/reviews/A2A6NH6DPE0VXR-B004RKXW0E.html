<meta name="summary" content="Pixar has done it again!"></head><body><p>Toy Story 3 has Andy's toys trying to find a new place where they belong after Andy gets ready to go away to college. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), however hasn't given up on Andy and plans on going away with him. But Woody's toy friends need his help because their stay at a daycare center isn't the paradise they thought it would be. Can Woody help them escape and make it home in time to go with Andy ?<br /><br />  The movie is a very satisfying end, for the movies that is, there's going to be a short before Cars 2 I heard. So we'll still get to see the characters that we love. But Toy Story 3 still feels like farewell and it has a very emotional ending that's bound to make you cry happy tears. Pixar has done it again because so far Toy Story 3 is the best movie that I've seen this year. Just see it, but bring tissues!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A cute story for food lovers."></head><body><p>A young rat named Remy is shunned by his family and other rats for his mature palate. While they, like all rats, eat garbage, he tries to blend flavors to enhance his food. When he, then, becomes unfortunately separated from the other rats he must learn to fend for himself for the first time and winds up in the most unlikely of situations. He teams up with Linguini, an awkward young man who is an aspiring chef. Together they are able to bring Remy's culinary visions to the (human) public. The unconventional duo must fight through adversity that is more than just what would happen if people found out that not only is there a rat in the kitchen, but that rat just prepared their dinner.<br /><br />I liked this movie. It wasn't my favorite Pixar movie, but I certainly enjoyed the creativity. And it looked great, as the Pixar movies all do. The story was a little weak on its own, and I feel that I enjoyed it a little more on a personal level than others might. If you don't enjoy being in the kitchen, you might miss some of the charm, I feel, was present in this movie.</p></body></html>

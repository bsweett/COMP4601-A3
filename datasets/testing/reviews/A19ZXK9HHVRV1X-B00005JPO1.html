<meta name="summary" content="Keeping Up With the Joneses"></head><body><p>***1/2<br /><br />*spoilers*<br /><br />Looking remarkably hale and fit for a man in his 60's, Harrison Ford returns as everyone's favorite archaeologist/adventurer in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," the fourth installment in the series that started with "Raiders of the Lost Ark" way back in 1981 (before Dr. Jones had sufficient notoriety to get his name placed in the title).<br /><br />It's 1957 and Indy's off on his latest adventure, hacking his way through the jungles of Peru in search of a mysterious crystal skull that may be a relic from a race of extraterrestrials who visited the area several millenia ago.  He is joined in his quest by Shia Labeouf as a cocky, motorcycle-riding teenager who may have more in common with the old codger than either of them can imagine; Karen Allen in a fun return as Jones' old flame from "Raiders" who's been kidnapped by some Russian agents; John Hurt as a fellow archaeologist who may already have fallen under the spell of the mysterious ancient artifact; and Cate Blanchett as an evil Soviet scientist intent on getting her hands on the object as a means of giving her country a strategic advantage in the escalating Cold War.<br /><br />"Crystal Skull" is not a great action flick by any means but, like its predecessors, it has a comfy old-fashioned quality that has us rooting for the good guys and against the bad guys in the best Saturday-afternoon-matinee tradition.  Director Steven Spielberg manages to get the adrenalin pumping with his exciting, if frankly preposterous, action sequences (ably enhanced by John Williams' made-to-order score) and the funny bone twitching with a series of smart-alecky one-liners, many of them aimed at Indiana's obviously advanced age, which the writer, David Koepp, in his wisdom, has chosen not to ignore but rather to make the object of some entirely good-natured joshing.<br /><br />These factors alone compensate for the over length, the occasional bog down in the action, and a finale that feels more appropriate to "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" than to the Indiana Jones franchise.<br /><br />More than anything else, perhaps, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" proves that you don't have to be in your 20's or 30's to be a robust, whip-cracking, action movie hero.  That's encouraging news for all of us regardless of age.</p></body></html>

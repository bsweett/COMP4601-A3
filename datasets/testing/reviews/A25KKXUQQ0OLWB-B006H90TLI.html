<meta name="summary" content="A Coen Brothers Masterpiece"></head><body><p>The Coen Brothers create another film that passes the threshold for greatness once again.  This time with an undisputed Oscar.  Tommy Lee Jones gives one of his greatest performances ever as a quiet West Texas sheriff feeling out gunned and in a more violent world than he ever imagined possible.  A man played by Javier Bardem travels the area as a unrepentant murderer while others try to win money and drugs in a Texas/Mexican horror.  The movie is similar to Blood Simple in that few characters beyond Tommy Lee and his wife have any moral feeling or backbone. The good doesn't win and the bad seems endless, no one does the right thing.  An upsetting movie but a great one.</p></body></html>

Sort of a strange mixture of DESPERADO, PULP FICTION, and a really good under-siege-by monsters flick; this movie starts w/ a bang and just keeps exploding! Tarantino and Clooney are as humorous as they are menacing as the notorious Gecko brothers. Their crime spree takes them to a biker / trucker bar in Mexico, where they find themselves under attack by an army of voracious, blood-sucking dancers (of the exotic variety), led by the unbelievably hot Salma Hayek! Her snake dance is seered in my memory forever! Watch as the Geckos, aided by their hostages (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis), along w/ a biker (Tom Savini) and a Viet Nam vet (Fred Williamson) do battle w/ the hordes of hell! Taking FDTD seriously is not an option. Just go with it and enjoy the fun...</p></body></html>

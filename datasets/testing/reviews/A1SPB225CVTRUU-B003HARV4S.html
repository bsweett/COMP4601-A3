<meta name="summary" content="There is some kind of magic in Norton's performance!"></head><body><p>I must admit that Edward Norton is the main reason I went to see the Illustionist immediately, because he's by far the most sophisticated actor of his generation, with credits in films like American History X and The 25th Hour to prove such reputation. The Illustration also features a scene-stealing Paul Giamati, and it's obvious that he can play a wide range of characters. I didn't think Jessica Biel was right for her part, because not only does she not look convincing in period wardrobe, she was floundering with a fake accent, and her performance is effortlessly upstaged by Norton and Rufus Sewell. This film does have impressive original score and visual efforts. There is good deal of character development for Norton's childhood character(Eisenheim), but nis travelling experince as a magican in his adulthood was not shown. Norton managed to deliver a performance that is fearless, mysterious and sexy. His romantic plot with Biel's character is under-developed, and it didn't really prepare the audience for the eventual surprise Ending. Giamati has a good amount of screentime to work with and his best moments are the solo scenes later in the film. It's a pretty entertaining for the most part, but it did have some slow-paceness for the first half of the film.</p></body></html>

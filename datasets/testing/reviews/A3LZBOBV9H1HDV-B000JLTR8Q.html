Paul Giamatti (who worked Howard's father on "Cinderella Man" (2005) & Bryce Dallas Howard (who worked with Shyamalan on "The Village" (2004) are excellent! The music by James Newton Howard (who has done the music on Shyamalan's films since "The Sixth Sense" (1999) is excellent! The cinematography by Christopher Doyle is excellent! The film editing by Barbara Tulliver (who also film edited Shyamalan's "Signs" (2002) is excellent! The casting by Douglas Aibel (who has done the casting on Shyamalan's films since "Unbreakable" (2000) is excellent! The production design by Martin Childs is excellent! The art direction by Stefan Dechant & Christina Ann Wilson is excellent! The set decoration by Larry Dias (who also did the set decoration to Shyamalan's "The Village" (2004) is excellent! The costume design by Betsy Heimann is excellent! This is another great effort from Shyamalan, who is more original than any filmmaker in Hollywood.</p></body></html>

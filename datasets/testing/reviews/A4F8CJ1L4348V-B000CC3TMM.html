<meta name="summary" content="This sequal is an ok one."></head><body><p>I really liked the first movie in this series. The second one I liked, but didn't like as much as the first one. This sequel just kept to one story about a little boy that was kidnapped. This movie still holds the action of the first, but I don't think is quiet as strong as the first one. I am a person that does like sequels and likes most, but this one isn't as strong. If you are a Jason Statham fan and you like the action in movies, then I recommend this one. Remember that this sequel doesn't have the "complexity" of the first one.</p></body></html>

Somehow this series manages to avoid all of the pitfalls that usually lead to the downfall of a television series.  The acting is first-rate and the storylines are engrossing and vibrant.  This is an imaginative show that constitutes first-rate entertainment.<br /><br />The theme is simple yet subtle.  A plane headed from Sydney Australia to Los Angeles USA goes off-course and crashes on an uninhabited island in the Pacific.  There are 41 survivors.  There are many strange things about the island, to put it mildly, and these anomalies become increasingly apparent as the story unfolds. (The most obvious anomaly is that it becomes apparent very shortly that there is little prospect of rescue.)  Further, there are connections between the passengers that most of them were unaware of.  The use of flashbacks concerning each of the principal characters is brilliantly done, and this often misused device is devastatingly effective here and serves to weave the story together.  The overall effect is a series that is incredibly absorbing and addictive.  The basic theme of the story, subtly recurring is "Don't tell me what I can't do...!"<br /><br />The acting is first rate.  Matthew Fox as Dr. Jack Sheppard is particularly good, but many of the others are also superb.  Naveen Andrews as Sayid is an especial favorite of mine, as are Harold Perrineau as Michael and Evangeline Lilly as Kate.  Every viewer will have his or her own favorites. As the series progressed I found myself liking Jorge Garcia as "Hurley" more and more.<br /><br />Rarely has television succeeded in producing a series of such quality.  Highly recommended.

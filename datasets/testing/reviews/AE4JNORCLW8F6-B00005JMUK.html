Charlize Theron's amazing physical and character transformation creates a mesmerizing realism. The entire presentation of the Aileen Wuornos story is an eye-opener, narrarated by her character and seen through her eyes. Though the real-life woman's story changed quite often, this portrayal was neither sympathetic nor harsh, leaving judgement to the viewer. Truly an unforgettable film.</p></body></html>

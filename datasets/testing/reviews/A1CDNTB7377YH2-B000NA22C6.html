<meta name="summary" content="A good thriller!"></head><body><p>Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) a writer in a remote house in upstate New York, encounters an "apparent" fan, a character named Shooter (John Turturro). Shooter has accused Mort of stealing his story and threatens to kill Mort and everyone he may have ever known if he doesn't fix the situation.<br /><br />Mort hires a special investigator (Charles Dutton to locate Mr. Shooter and try to stop him.<br /><br />Shooter begins affecting Mort and his life almost immediately, Mort's dog is killed, a man who saw Shooter talk to Mort is found dead, and crucial evidence that Mort could use to clear his name is destroyed. It is at this point that we start questioning what is real and what is not.  As a matter of fact the movie may have been inspired by a recent Russell Crowe movie.<br /><br />The movie motors on to a climax that is different from the normal genre and that is why I rate it so high.  Both Depp and Turturro give excellent performances and look for Timothy Hutton in a lesser role as the boyfriend of Depp's estranged-wife.</p></body></html>

It achieves success in both areas, and is actually a good film that is not nearly as graphic as the trailers and the adverts might lead you to believe. While hardly a great movie, it is good for it's genre, and should appeal to it's fans.<br /><br />The movie opens with two characters, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and nondescript young Joe-everyman Adam (Leigh Whannell), waking up in some dingy forgotten bathroom, chained to the walls with a dead body lying between them. We soon learn, well ahead of the main protagonists, that they are the victims of a serial killer known as "Jigsaw", known for his unusual MO of having his victims kill themselves somehow. To elaborate on that would be giving too much away. Both men discover that they are in danger, and they must work together to find their way out, otherwise Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter will die, and they will rot in their "prison". Added to the mix is the disgruntled cop (Danny Glover) who has personal reasons for finding the serial killer, who basically adds filler to the story that would otherwise be too short for a feature length movie. While Saw borrows from more prominent serial killer movies, especially Seven, it does have some unique twists and clever fright scenes. Where this movie really succeeds is in the visual atmosphere. The dank bathroom and the spooky interior settings make this movie very unsettling, while the more visceral horror works on a more psychological level.<br /><br />Saw works on the whole, but it is not without flaws. For starters, a good plot doesn't necessarily mean a good script. The dialogue, written by star Leigh Whannell, it totally banal and stilted, and it makes the screenplay seem very much like the work of an amateur. Next, the acting is less than first rate. Whannell is not bad, but Elwes is definitely out of his element in this movie. While he is not known as great actor, he has done much better than this before. However, my biggest problem is with the Danny Glover character, the clich&eacute;d "bitter cop out for revenge" subplot that has been done to death, and it adds nothing of value to this movie.<br /><br />Despite it's shortcomings, Saw is an effective and compelling thriller that should satisfy most of it's audience. The premise of the story, coupled with the notable plot twists, save this movie from being just another serial killer rehash, and I would recommend it based on that alone.</p></body></html>

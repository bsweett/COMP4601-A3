An excellent date movie. I think even kids will probably find parts of this amusing. His co-star Eva Mendes is not only beautiful, but does a wonderful performance as his romantic interest that very much has a mind of her own. Support roles by Kevin James and others are outstanding and make this an above par look at the rigors of dating. It covers all the bases of how to pick someone up without pickup lines to dancing without looking like a fool. If you enjoy the romantic movies without the fluff like "50 First Dates", you should like this one. This movie will make you laugh and cry. It genuinely touches the heart and funny bone. Great acting, script, locations, camera work, and music make this a keeper. Get it!</p></body></html>

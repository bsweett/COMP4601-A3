<meta name="summary" content="Fairly Entertaining, But ... Is This Script What We Waited for 19 Years?"></head><body><p>OK, I admit "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is a pretty entertaining film. Harrison Ford is impressive as likeable hero Indy Jones and the film certainly offers a fair amount of action and lots of stunts in the course of the hero's adventures to seek treasures and fight Russian baddies led by Cate Blanchett's "Col. Irina Spalko."<br /><br />But quite honestly I cannot believe that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have really chosen this awfully contrived script for the new Indy film. We have waited so long for the "comeback" of Dr. Jones, especially after reading so many publicized reports of failed attempts to find the right screenplay, but surely we didn't expect to see this one given the green light.<br /><br />From the opening sequence where we are told something about a government's secret and Roswell, this fourth Indy film will not be the same as good, old 80s-style action adventure the franchise was once. Spielberg tries to keep the spirit of old-fashioned action adventure, and Karen Allen reprises the role of Marion of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," but the overuse of special effects, unbelievable actions (apparently Indy can survive anything, even a nuclear blast) and the lack of coherent storyline (who is Ray Winstone"s character anyway?) are too much to be ignored.<br /><br />But what is most disappointing to me is that there is nothing new in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." There is no formidable villain or villainess; no thrills of watching a falling bridge; no charisma of Sean Connery. After the third Indy film made back in 1989, we have seen such films as "The Mummy," "The National Treasure," "Sahara" and so on. The new Indiana Jones film needs something that these films don't have, but except the heroic figure of Indiana Jones I couldn't find one in "Crystal Skull."</p></body></html>

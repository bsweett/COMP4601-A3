<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic heroes trapped in ordinary movie"></head><body><p>The Fantastic Four are the latest addition from Marvel heroes to hit the screen. Starring Ioan Gruduff, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Julian McMahon and Michael Chikis, this is just another big, loud, special effects-packed movie with a bland story. Even admitting it is a fun movie to watch, I have to say is just as forgettable as a bad hair day. When compared to Pixar's The Incredibles, a truly magnificent movie, I can't help but realize the Fantastic Four turned their characters into a silly cartoon, while The Incredibles did just the opposite.<br /><br />The Four gain their powers during an accident in space. Mr Fantastic, alias Dr Reed Richards, possesses the properties of an infinitely stretchy rubber band. Sue Storm, his ex girlfriend (not for long) is the Invisible Woman, capable of creating field forces. Her brother, Johnny, is the Human Torch, who has with the ability to combust and turn his body into a heat missile without doing himself the slightest bit of damage and Ben Grimm becomes the Thing, a moving rock pile with a gravel voice, a heart of gold and the strength of Hercules, who is also the group's tragic figure, because unlike the others, he cannot turn his powers on and off.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is pure fun scenes, with the Four learning about their powers, Chris Evans tormenting the Thing, and their whiny complaints about their new changes.<br /><br />The director works very well the moments when the fantastic collides with the everyday. But character is incidental. The film's real business lies in bigness. Blowing things up, driving them off roads and bridges, watching them crumble, freeze and burn.<br /><br />The acting is standard, only because the script doesn't give these actors much to do. The only exception is Michael Chiklis as The Thing, who although covered in that afwful rubber suit is the character best exploited, physically and emotionally. And Julian Mc Mahon, who gets to be the evil Dr Doom, very well casted but they could have get much more from him.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a fun movie but a very shallow one. If you want true superheroes, see the Incredibles.</p></body></html>

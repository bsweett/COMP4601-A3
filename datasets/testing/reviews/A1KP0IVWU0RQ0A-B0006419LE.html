<meta name="summary" content=""tonight we witness the birth of the planet of the apes""></head><body><p>any kid worth his salt growing up in the 70's watched as on friday nights cbs ran the planet of the apes movies, i know because i was one of them, and because they were rated high on the t.v. charts.<br /><br />"planet of the apes" (1968) began the whole saga as taylor(charlton heston) crashes his spaceship on a desert planet some 2 to 3000 years into the future. after a sureal trek through a desert they find plant life and water,and human life . the humans are caveman in type and don't talk. taylor and his friends are just thinking about what to do next when an unearthly hunt call sends the humans running and the bigest suprise of all,<br /><br /> apes on horse back and with guns are hunting the humans. once seen the hunt will never be forgotten. as his friends are killed taylor is hurt and we learn that the apes rule this world. this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made , as taylor fights for his life and a reason for a planet ruled by apes. in the end he finds his reason in one of the greatest endings ever put on film , and if you haven't seen it i'm sure you have heard of it.<br /><br />  "beneath the planet of the apes " takes place just after the first films ends and adds another spaceman brent to the mix as he is sent to find out what happened to taylor, not as good as the first but still fun and action packed. and it looks like the end of the series.<br /><br />  "escape from the planet of the apes" shifted the time line to modren day(read 1973) and put the apes in the forground as the ones we care about. a fun almost remake in reverse of the first it ends very downbeat but paves the way for the next in the series.<br /><br />" conquest of the planet of the apes" takes place in the future(the 1980's) as a plague has killed all dogs and cats on earth and people have taken apes as pets,buthave found they make better slaves than pets.enter the son of the apes in "escape" as he leads a revolt and takes over the earth. this one is pg instead of g because of the dark nature of this one shot trip into a dark event. maybe the best of the whole series.<br /><br />  "battle for the planet of the apes" the last in the series and the least of the films follows the apes after the revolt and sees their last fight against the humans that want to control them.<br /><br />" behind the planet of the apes " tells the story of the making of all the movies and anything else you could want to know about the movies and is hosted by the late roddy mcdowell and is just great.<br /><br />this is the best collection of any movie serise i have seen. if you love this series you need this set. you'll go ape for it. (haha)</p></body></html>

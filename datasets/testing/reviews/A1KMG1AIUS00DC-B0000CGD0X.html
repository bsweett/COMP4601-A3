<meta name="summary" content="We'll Always Have "Casablanca""></head><body><p>"Casablanca" is a motion picture classic beloved by millions.  Warner Home Video has honored this wartime romantic drama with an elaborate box set to commemorate the 70th anniversary of its theatrical release.<br /><br />World War II is raging and the Nazis are occupying North Africa, but Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is sitting out the war in Casablanca as proprietor of the most popular nightclub in town.  The cynical Rick comes into possession of two letters of transit permitting their carriers to leave the country.  To placate Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), local police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) detains Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is accompanied by Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), Rick's former love.  Old flames are rekindled and Rick plans use the letters of transit to leave Casablanca with Ilsa.<br /><br />The film could have turned out to be a standard wartime drama, but everything clicked:  Michael Curtiz's direction; a fresh and clever script; colorful characters; the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman; a first-class supporting cast (Rains, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Dooley Wilson); a haunting song, "As Time Goes By," that runs through the film as Rick and Ilsa's love theme; and the immediacy of a war whose outcome was still undetermined.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart, who had previously played gangsters, took on his first romantic lead in "Casablanca."  George Raft had unsuccessfully angled for the role of Rick.  Ingrid Bergman, under contract at the time to David O. Selznick, was borrowed by Jack Warner to co-star with Bogart.  Composer Max Steiner was against using "As Time Goes By" and Warner finally agreed to let him write an original song for the movie, but by then Bergman had cut her hair for another movie and couldn't re-shoot the scenes in which the song was heard.  Sam, Rick's singer-pianist, who performs the song, was nearly made a female, with Hazel Scott, Lena Horne, and Ella Fitzgerald considered for the role.  Dooley Wilson, the eventual Sam, was a drummer and faked playing the piano.<br /><br />No movie has more memorable dialogue.  "Here's looking at you, kid" was voted as the Number 5 most famous movie quote by the American Film Institute.  Other lines that live in memory include "We'll always have Paris," "Round up the usual suspects," "The problems of two people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world," and "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."  But Bogie never spoke the line "Play it again Sam."  That was the title of Woody Allen's 1972 homage to "Casablanca."  Rather, Rick says to Sam, who had performed the song at Ilsa's request, "You played it for her.  You can play it for me."<br /><br />The 3-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition box set contains Blu-ray and DVD versions, reproduction of the original 1942 French film poster, 60-page production art book, and collectible drink coaster set.  Among the 14 hours of bonus material are two new documentaries: "Casablanca: An Unlikely Classic" and a look at the career of director Michael Curtiz; full-length documentaries on the history of Warner Brothers Studio and its founders; outtakes; a vintage cartoon; two radio broadcasts; several short subjects; audio commentary by Roger Ebert; and an introduction by Lauren Bacall.</p></body></html>

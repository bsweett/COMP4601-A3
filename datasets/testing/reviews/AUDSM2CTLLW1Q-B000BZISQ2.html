Debates rage back and forth over which film was better.  Is it "T2" with its non-stop juggernaut of action?  Or, is the original "Terminator" with its suspense, human drama, and fresh story?  The argument will like never be settled.  One question that can be answered, though, is 'Is "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"' as good as its predecessors.  The answer to that question is definitely 'no'.  "Terminator 3" is nowhere near as good as the movies that spawned, but, at the same time, it is not a bad movie either.<br /><br />The problems that plague "T3" may stem from the fact that James Cameron is not directing this time ("U-571" director Jonathan Mostow helms it this time).  They may also simply stem from the fact that there has been such a long layoff between movies.  "Judgment Day" came out in 1991, which "Rise of the Machines" was released this year, 2003.  The novelty has worn off by now.  It also maybe just the simple fact that movie is not much more than a series of protracted actions scenes that seem like they could have been cut from the earlier films.  The movie still manages to garner a positive review because, in its climax, it takes a bold and unexpected turn that shows real audacity and leaves the door open for additional sequels.<br /><br />"Rise of the Machines" focuses of the life of John Connor (Nick Stahl) in decade or so since the events of "Judgment Day".  While the destruction of Skynet labs seemed to have put an end to the technology that would have brought about holocaust of Judgment Day, Connor is unable to feel comfortable.  He lives an existence that make him near impossible to trace, fearing the monsters of the future may one day come back for him.  And, like in the previous film, they do.  This time, it's a female Terminator, the T-X (played icily by model Kristanna Loken) who has been sent back to kill Connor and thereby end the threat of the human who can defeat the machines.  In a carbon copy move of the previous film, Arnold Schwarzenneger's Terminator (or a copy of him) is sent back in time to defend Connor from this new threat.  From the point of their arrival, "Rise of the Machines" becomes nothing more than one long chase scene.  Along the way, Connor and the Terminator pick up an acquaintance from Connor's past, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) and they rush to get away from the T-X.  It's important for them to stay alive because it seems that Judgment day was NOT averted, and Connor must live so that the resistance can be led against the Machines.  Connor still believes Judgment Day can be avoided and its a race against time to prevent it.<br /><br />Nick Stahl may not seem like a great choice to play John Connor.  He still seems childish and unimpressive (how are we to believe this man is supposed to lead the resistance?), but then Edward Furlong wasn't exactly an inspired choice to play him in "T2".  It's nice to see Arnold back in his familiar role.  Though, at times, he seems like a parody of his famous character.  Danes is really just window dressing in her role as Kate Brewster.  She doesn't really contribute much beyond a vast catalog of screams and pained expressions.  Loken's quite a looker as the T-X and is quite menacing, but the role doesn't exactly give her much to act with, so it's hard to evaluate her performance.<br /><br />Overall, "Rise of the Machines" is a respectable film.  It's not a great one, but it doesn't fail the way other sequels have after long layoffs ("Alien: Resurrection" to name one).  It's a classic summertime popcorn action movie.  It's also not a bad way to spend 2 hours.</p></body></html>

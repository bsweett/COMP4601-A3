<meta name="summary" content="The Lake House"></head><body><p>Alex (Reeves) and Kate (Bullock) are two lonely people.  They each live in a fancy glass house on the shore of Lake Michigan.  The same house, in fact.  He lives there in 2004, she lives there in 2006.  The house's mailbox begins delivering letters through time, and the two are able to communicate, and eventually fall in love.  They just have to figure out how to meet.<br /><br />If you can get over the time traveling mailbox, "The Lake House" is an enjoyable movie.  Reeves and Bullock are together again for the first time since "Speed", and one wonders why they have not teamed up again sooner.  They have a chemistry that is believable, and you root for the characters to get together in the end.  I recommend this film.</p></body></html>

And it just happens that PF is his best movie. It has an all star cast, and plus, some great action.<br /><br />STORY: This movie is actually 3 stories: The first one is about a man named Vincent Vega returning home from Amsterdam to a girl he meets named Mia Farrows. The second one is about a boxer, who forgets his watch at Vincent's apartment, then finds the therapist and tries to kill him. After the attempt to kill the therapist fails, he ends up running from the therapist. The third and final story is what happened before Vincent  and the other guy (I forget his name) left back home for America.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: What a work of art! Totally one of the greatest films ever made. TOtally what a QT fan needs!<br /><br />So if you love Quentin Tarantino, them buy this movie!</p></body></html>

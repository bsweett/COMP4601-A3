"The Descendants" is exactly that kind of movie.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Descendants" begins with Elizabeth King (Patricia Hastie) in a coma after a severe boating accident.  When husband Matt (George Clooney) learns that she will not be waking up from her coma, he must take his two daughters Alex (Shailene Woodley) & Scottie (Amara Miller) on a trip to inform the relatives.  Along the way, Matt discovers that Elizabeth was cheating on him, and alternatively confronts the man who she had the affair with.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is that it utterly fails to tug at the emotions whatsoever.  We are supposed to become deeply involved with the King family, but instead the character development just falls flat.  It takes a great director to weave everything together, but in this case Alexander Payne just fails to get it done.  All the elements are present...but it just doesn't jell together as it should.<br /><br />It is also strange that, despite the very Hawaiian soundtrack & locale, Hawaii doesn't add anything to this movie.  If a movie is made that heavily features such a locale, it needs to be an integral part of the storyline.  Instead, the Hawaiian flavor doesn't add a thing to this film...only muddying the waters further.<br /><br />Overall, "The Descendants" was a big letdown for me considering its Oscar buzz earlier in 2012.  It is miles behind films like "War House", "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close", and "The Help".  It doesn't even touch Clooney's earlier "Up in the Air" effort, which was one of the better films I saw that year.  Unfortunately, this one just falls flat.</p></body></html>

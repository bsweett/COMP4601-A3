Since "Spider", "A history of violence" and now with his "Eastern promises"  have become him a true referential director, with a very personal style and absolute domain of the cinematographic language. His films are featured by a distinctive expression without necessarily falling into a "commercial label". He just leaves besides unanswered questions, like this terrible fact around the presence of the Russian mob in London.<br /><br />Cronenberg makes of the violence not a goal but a device to justify it as a mere surviving mechanism. Two well opposite extremes of an ethic chain like a nurse and a driver of the son of a well known "Russian Godfather" will involve themselves around a painful circumstance.<br /><br />The entire cast was splendid, but it's worthy to remark the impressive performance of Vigo Mortensen as the cold driver and the absorbing acting of Armin M?ller Stahl (Symeon) one of the ten best living actors in the world , make of this original proposal a must see.<br /><br />Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

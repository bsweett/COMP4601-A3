<meta name="summary" content="Glad To 'Meet' This Movie"></head><body><p>I have been listening to interviews that Ben Stiller has been giving for the last couple of years.  Being a big fan of "Meet The Parents," I wanted to hear what was happening with the long awaited sequel.  He kept saying "We are delaying the making of the movie, because we want to get a script that we really like and is really good."  At first I thought that was code for "We can't seem to think of a good script and the sequel in not going to be any good."  I'm glad that I was wrong with that assumption.<br /><br />The movie has a really simple storyline:  Greg (Stiller) and Pam (Polo) are going to get married after a two year delay and its time for Pam's parents to meet Greg's parents.  Pam's dad Jack (DeNiro) is worried that Greg's family is going to ruin his families legacy.  That they will put a "chink" in the family chain.  And his worries are soon confirmed when he actually meets Greg's parents.  Greg's dad Bernard (Hoffman) is a very honest, a little too honest person, that likes to tell embarressing stories and is a stay-at-home dad.  Greg's mother, Roz (Streisand) is a senior sex consultant, who wants to know everything about Greg and the Byrnes' sex life.  So Greg has to try to make his family seem acceptable to Jack.  Obviously, that doesn't work too well and many funny sequences occur thereafter.<br /><br />All of the characters that return in this movie are basically the same characters.  The only major difference is that Pam's sister, Deborah, had a baby and Jack is watching it.  Stiller and DeNiro do another great job at their characters.  This is the kind of role that Stiller was born to play and also his funniest character that he plays.  Jay Roach also returned for this movie.  He optioned to make this movie instead of making Austin Powers 4, which looks like will never see the light of day.  Thank God!<br /><br />I would definately recommend seeing this movie.  It was really funny, the funniest movie that I have seen this year since "Dodgeball".  Hollywood should also take this movie as a hint.  Take time to make a really good movie, rather than shoveling out a crappy sequel the following year.  The audiences will be patient for quality.</p></body></html>

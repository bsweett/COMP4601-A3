You can look at it as a prequel to Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, or you can look at it as a remake of Manhunter.  Either way though, the potential for disaster was huge going into making Red Dragon after the dreadful Hannibal was released in 2001, but all's well that ends well here.  Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lecter, though he is in more of a supporting role here.  Ed Norton stars as Will Graham, an FBI profiler brought back to use his unique talents to track down a brutal serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy (a tattooed and frequently naked Ralph Fiennes).  Being a fan of Manhunter, I was leary when hearing that it would be re-made as Red Dragon (but not surprised considering all the money Hannibal banked), and was even more leary when I had heard that Brett Ratner was directing, but now I'm pretty much eating my words here because Red Dragon turned out to be much much better than I had expected.  The only real flaw with Red Dragon are the scenes between Hopkins and Norton.  In Silence of the Lambs, the interplay between Hopkins and Jodie Foster was what made that film as good as it was, but it doesn't work between Hopkins and Norton for one simple reason: Hannibal isn't scary anymore.  In Silence of the Lambs, Lecter was a truly scary character that could make your skin crawl just by hearing him talk, but after Hannibal was released, he's just become a Hollywood circus side-show attraction that makes creepy sounding pronounciations.  But besides all that, Red Dragon is an above average thriller that delivers the goods, and Ralph Fiennes' performance as the Tooth Fairy is reason enough to see the film.</p></body></html>

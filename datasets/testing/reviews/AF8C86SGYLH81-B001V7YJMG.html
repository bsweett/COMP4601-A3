<meta name="summary" content="A classic vampire breakthrough"></head><body><p>This film lives up to all of the accolades including Horror Film of the Year by Fangoria Magazine.  It is definitely "A vampire tale like no other.  Mesmerizing," as stated on the DVD box.  The relationship between Oscar and Eli is profound.  The editing is perfect.  The casting is perfect.  The setting is perfect.  And the English dubbing is first class.  Five stars...hands down.  One of the most romantic horror films I have ever seen.  I, too, fell in love with Eli.  Oscar's first love is definitely his last.  He watches her back...she watches his.  A gem!</p></body></html>

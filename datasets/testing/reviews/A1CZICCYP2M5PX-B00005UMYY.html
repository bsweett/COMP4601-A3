<meta name="summary" content="An strong thriller, one of the most unusual films of 2001."></head><body><p>Leonard `Lenny` Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man who has a short memory spam, the only thing, he could remember seeing his wife being murderer and ever since, he can`t remember the next day and even the next few minutes before. He tattoos his body for clues or things, he doesn`t remember. The closer, he`s finding the murderer, who killed his wife, the more it`s gets worse.<p>Directed by Christopher Nolan (Insonmia-Remake) shows as one of the most promising new directors out there. The film receives Two Oscar Nominations from Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay-Written by Christopher Nolan from a Story by Jonathan Nolan. Memento did win Four Independent Spirit Awards including:Best Director, Best Feature, Best Screenplay and Best Suppporting Actress:Carrie Anne-Moss. It was nominated for the Independent Spirit Awards for Best Cinematpgraphy. This is a well written mystery suspense thriller. DVD`s has a sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and Clear Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Some might find this film to be uneven, because the film is told in backwards (Expect for the Black and White Flashbacks) and it`s not for all tastes but Still, this is a one of a kind movie. Alternate Verison of the Film tells the story foward, not backwards (as a Hidden Feature on Disc 2). Panavision. Grade:A.</p></body></html>

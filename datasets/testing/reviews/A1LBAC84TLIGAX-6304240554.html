<meta name="summary" content="ZOMBIE HORROR CLASSIC 9.25 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Ah, Dawn of the Dead, so much to thank for when it comes to my favorite horror flicks Resident Evil: Extinction and 28 Weeks Later. This horror film most certainly revered as one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and why would anyone challenge this? The zombies look really cheesy, but the gore is what makes this movie so good in its zombie themes. The storyline is basically about four people who go to stay at a mall during the zombie invasion to stay alive. The storyline is vague unfortunately(there's no more room in hell so zombies walk the earth). The action is still solid to this day, the gore is still awesome, the characters are still awesome, and the creepy vibe is still there.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dramatic action classic and one of Stallone's best movies"></head><body><p>First Blood is action classic that makes you think. Stallone created a new franchise for himself in the form of John Rambo. Brain Denhey makes great bad guy and Richard Crenna as the father figure type is always good. The action sequences in the film are intense but below all that is a film with heart that makes you think.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Clint Eastwood movie that will make you cry!"></head><body><p>I never thought I would say that.  When you think of Clint Eastwood, you think of action packed westerns, macho police dramas and adventure films that bring you to the edge of your seat.  But this movie throws his mystique out the window.  He has come full circle, giving us a drama about common people, dreams and heartbreak.  It's purpose is filled with self realization, hard choices and consequences.  Eastwood continues his incredible 15 year ride of outstanding filmmaking with an Oscar worthy perfomance.  If Jamie Foxx didn't win or wasn't nominated, Eastwood would have completed the triple crown winning Director, Producer and Actor awards.  Hillary Swank proves her Oscar winning peformance for "Boys Don't Cry" wasn't a fluke.  And Morgan "Easy Reader" Freeman gives his best perfomance of his career.  Though it's ending is controversial, it is a conversation piece.  You will laugh, you will cry, but in the end, you won't soon forget Eastwood's finest film.</p></body></html>

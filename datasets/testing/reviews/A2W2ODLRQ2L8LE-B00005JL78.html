<meta name="summary" content="Mission Impossible on Steroids"></head><body><p>This film puts you on the edge from the opening scenes. This storyline is fully tricked out, and takes you on a roller-coaster ride in your mind. Tom Cruise plays the part of a captain of a PreCrime Team that stop murders before they can take place.<br /><br />But all is not well for him, as he is haunted by the guilt of losing his son, and this was followed by a divorce.<br /><br />The film is set about 50 years into the future and the transport systems are way cool, and include: complex auto tranport systems, jet back packs and hover craft type military transporters.<br /><br />Observation is the key to following this film. All is not what is seems to be, the plot is as thick as plots can get. Figuring out the bad guy in this film is almost impossible, because he lies in wait quietly for his victim and is as smooth as a snake in the grass.<br /><br />This is a top notch sci-fi thriller and it's loaded with high-end special effects, but the stroyline also packs a great punch.</p></body></html>

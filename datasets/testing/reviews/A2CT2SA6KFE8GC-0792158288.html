The price is right and the films are tight(you like that? I just made that up).  I won't go into the plot details, coz you'd have to be a schmuck if you haven't seen these films about 800 times throughout your life.  But I will say that this trilogy is the very definition of Action-Adventure, and Indiana Jones is the definition of Action hero-tied only with James Bond.  I don't think any action film since has surpassed these.  These were made in the glorious days of action-the 80s.  Back when a PG rated film could show people's faces melting, or have a bald nazi hacked up into hamburger helper by an airplane propeller.  In fact, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is probably the most violent PG rated film ever.  Temple Of Doom says PG on the dvd case now, as opposed to it's original PG-13 rating, but that was probably a mistake.  It's still the same film-heart ripping, bug eating, child whipping and all!  The dvds are featureless, but that's what the fourth disc is for.  Basically, it's the features from all films put on one disc.  Not a bad idea.  So, I'd suggest slapping yourself a few times if you haven't got it already, then run out and get it, pronto!</p></body></html>

I have the Collectors Edition and know nothing about Bluray, though it seems there are many reviews that talk more about Bluray and techy stuff than about the story. I don't have bluray, and my DVD is just fine!  I very much enjoyed the 2nd disc Collectors Edition, and the discussions with Spielberg, the editors, artists, musicians, actors and others who made this such an enjoyable film.  Mainly because it was just so much FUN to watch!<br /><br />I give it more than 5 stars, as all the fantasy (fantastic) scenes were made without today's help from computers.  Everything they did was done without computers and it still looked real.  As much as I love Harry Potter, and I do,  I doubt it could have been made or even attempted without computers.<br /><br />I"m glad I bought the 2 disk version because the 2nd disk explained so much about the making of the film and the selection of the characters.  The little boy in the film, now all grown up explains how such a little child was able to attain the expressions, the wide eyed looks and his adorable smile that a kitchen gone crazy might have frightened a child of his age (I think he was about 4).  (He was my favorite character.)<br /><br />Terry Garr was perfect in her role as the bewildered wife and Richard Dreyfus, perfect as the man whose mind had gone far off kilter so that he could follow a strange obsession placed there by the UFO, uh, characters.  Great music by John Williams (per usual) and Francois Truffaut, an excellent French actor and director brought a kind of scientific reality to the whole fantasy. Can there be UFOS? I doubt it, but who knows?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the best movie about the last days of the third reich ever."></head><body><p>This is very similiar to past movies, "the bunker' and 'hitler the last ten days" and this is the same story too. It's a terrible and true one. The merciless Hitler awaits his downfall  and so does the 3rd reich.  The last few months of the war in europe were among the most bloody too. But this one really takes what we know and makes it the clearest picture yet.  The direction and acting is first class. I can't imagine that anyone who has seen this movie can complain about any of it. It's a german movie and this blu ray is a all region one so you can watch it on your blu ray in the u.s. too.  This is truly a great movie though. It's like watching the end of a long tragedy and the key players are coming to grips with their fates. It has english subtitles too.</p></body></html>

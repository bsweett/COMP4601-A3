Jodei Foster is one my all time Favorite Actresses,but they are both wasted on this overblown film. back in the day Spike Lee was happening,but it's been so long since he has made a film that has truly held my full attention. I dig the aingle where he is coming from with this picture,but something is missing in this film that keeps it from reaching it's peak. you get a Post 9/11 flavor with a few other past films of this style thrown in.  it should have been more tighter.</p></body></html>

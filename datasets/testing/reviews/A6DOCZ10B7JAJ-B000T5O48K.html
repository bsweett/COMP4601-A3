<meta name="summary" content="A shattering of the soul"></head><body><p>First off, totally exterminate any preconceived notions of the extreme horror you might be accustomed to.  Bug is more of an alarming psychological journey into the human mind, an intense exploration of a broken soul.  It's closer to the films Beautiful Mind and Conspiracy Theory than something like Aliens or The Fly.  Director William Freidkin opens the crazy door and dares you to step inside.<br /><br />The acting and character development in this movie is outstanding.  Ashley Judd gives the performance of her lifetime as Agnes, an emotionally battered waitress who is hanging on by a thread.  She has a trainwreck of a past, from her abusive ex-husband to her missing child.<br /><br />She meets a mysterious loner named Peter, and he might offer a hand toward gaining some mental stability.  Or he might push them both over the edge.  We quickly realize it's most likely the latter, as this romance doesn't take long to unravel.  Peter is a war veteran, and claims to be the victim of some extreme government experimentations.  His military leaders apparently planted "bugs" under his skin.  This may or may not be true, but one thing is for sure--his inner demons are about to come crawling out.<br /><br />Freidkin unleashes a totally original and riveting psychological drama.  The symptoms of this story frantically spread and feed off your mind in frightening fashion.  A psychotically sick tale that plagues you with themes of loneliness, desperation, and mental instability.  Plus it lightly touches on notions of government control and the devastating effects of war.  Such a great film, one that might come off as ridiculous to some as it blazes an unfamiliar path.  But for open-minded movie watchers ready to be challenged, this is must-see stuff.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A slick potboiler, but pretty tame in retrospect"></head><body><p>In 1979 Sean S. Cunningham was looking to produce a mere potboiler to tide him over until his next serious project. His idea of a Summer Camp Killer movie seemed like a decent, low-budget, one-shot deal and he went with it. There was nothing particularly memorable or unique about it but it was bought by Paramount and released as a mainstream film, rather than a independent struggler. The response was huge and it soon became clear that Friday the 13th was not a mere paycheck but a serious cash-cow. Sequels followed. And the rest is history.<br /><br />Many, many people claim that Friday the 13th rips off Halloween. Which is not a very fair or kind statement. Sure, it's no work of art and has many similarities, but Halloween was NOT the first slasher movie as Black Christmas and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre came before it. I was actually draw more parallels between this and The Last House on the Left, which was also produced by Cunningham. Friday the 13th is a slicker, tamer film in comparison but if TLHOTL never existed then we would have the Friday the 13th franchise that we have today.<br /><br />The characters and deaths are not so imaginative. All we really get is throat slashings and impalings. But at least the fodder are not as obnoxious and annoying as they would later become in the sequels, when they truly deserved more grotesque deaths.<br /><br />At the time, the ending was surprising only because it came out of nowhere. The sudden unveiling of the killer and motives was random and unexpected. It's weird watching it now, knowing that Jason and parts 2-infinity were never planned. Jason was just a dead boy and nothing more.<br /><br />It's hard to review Friday the 13th on it's own merits rather than the movie that launched a major franchise. A low-brow slasher script made into a potboiler movie that ended up making zillions in sequels, spin-offs, TV series', toys, games and accessories seems so far-fetched.<br /><br />Paramount bungled the aspect ratio and framing on this Blu Ray btw.</p></body></html>

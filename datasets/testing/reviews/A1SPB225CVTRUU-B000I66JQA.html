<meta name="summary" content="" You Are Laura Brown.""></head><body><p>I must say that I loved this movie a great deal, and I saw it at the theater 2 times, but I saw Frida 5 times. I am very pleased with the cast, art direction, director, and oringinal score. What I was trully disappointed and even upset by was that Salma Hayek lost the Oscar to Nicole Kidman who had just one third of the movie here, and Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep not only had more screen time, but were more mesmerizing. Kidman was better in her other films including The Others, Moulin Rouge, and her breakthrough To Die For. This beautiful and artsy "heavy-duty" drama is not going to be appreciated by anyone who has sexual phobia or unsympathetic towards depressed and tramatized characters vividly portrayed here by Ed Harris, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep. If you embrace this film, you will be profoundly moved. Otherwise, you'll probably end up resenting it.<br /><br />Everyone in The Hours has something to do with the book Mrs. Dalloway written by Virginia Wolfe(Nicole Kidman) in the '30s of Richmond, England, and Julianne Moore  played a depressed housewife named Laura Brown living in Los Angeles in the '50s. Wolfe's book not only made an impact on Laura Brown, it also affected the lives of a the readers of modern day include Laura Brown's son Richard, a writer played by the scene-stealing Ed Harris, and his caretaker/ex-lover Clarissa Vaughan(Meryl Streep). Mrs. Dalloway is a character of good hostess, and she likes to throw parties for her friends, but ultimately neglects herself and becomes depressed. Clarissa gets nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by Richard, because she loves to throw parties.<br /><br />The three time periods and stories are not directly connected, by it serves the same purpose for the film, and it's edited meticulously along with appropriate scores that makes the film consistent. The film takes place in just one day in three different eras. It the beginning, Wolfe narratted a suicide note as she walked into a river after completing the writing of Mrs. Dalloway. Then it goes backward to early on in the day before when she was still working on the book. The three eras are inserted between each other back and forth as the day in the lives of three women progresses.<br /><br />In the day of Virginia, she gets a visit from her sister(played by the mesmerizing Miranda Richardson), and her children. While she was lounging with them, her mind was in the world of Mrs. Dalloway, and her sister was overwhelmed that she's still so eccentric and unstable. Later, she attempted to ran away from her husband, because she didn't want to live in Richmond anymore, and wanted to move back to London. Her husband acused of her mental sickness.....<br /><br />In the day of Laura Brown, she's heavily pregnant, and she spends the day at home with her son Richard. She reads Mrs. Dalloway, and was moved by it a great deal. She bakes a cake for her husband's(John C. Reiley) birthday with the help of Richard. Her neighbor Kitty comes over to ask her to take care of her dog when she goes to the hospital. Toni Collette is just in this one scene(about 5 mins.), and she's quite striking, especially when she engages a "lesbian kiss" with Julianne Moore. This moment she realized that she's so unhappy being a housewife, and wanted to end it. Later, Brown impulsively abandons Richard and proceeded a suicide attempt like the end of the book in a hotel room.......<br /><br />In the day of Mrs. Dalloway/Clarissa Vaughan buys the flowers herself like Mrs. Dalloway in the book. She goes to visit Richard who's dying of AIDS, and has no desire to live any longer. The party is being put together for him to celebrate his award-winning novel based on his life, with a "monster" character based on his mother, but he's reluctant to go, because he didn't want anyone to see him so sick. One of Richard's ex-boyfriend(Jeff Daniel) also came to her apartment when she was preparing the food. She breaks down into massive tears when they talked about the old memories of their relationship with Richard.......<br /><br />Other supporting roles are well played by Allison Janney(Clarissa's lover), Stephen Dillane(Wolfe's unconditional-loving husband), and Claire Danes(Clarissa's daughter).<br /><br />I was very moved by Ed Harris role and performance. He really portrayed all the pain and sadness of someone who is dying and had been abandoned by his mother when he was a boy. The scene when he committed suicide in front of Clarissa was so powerful. Meryl Streep was mesmerizing! Julianne Moore's depressed and suicidal housewife who chose to abandon her family instead killing herself may be unlikeable, but she's more outstanding, especially her scene opposite Meryl Streep when her character aged to be an old woman. The remorse and sadness on her face was flawless. As for Nicole Kidman, the scene at the train station was her best in this movie. It was a very heavy agruement with her husband. She's very meticulous with the mannerism, even though she doesn't totally looked like Virginia Wolfe. She's captivately when her mind is doing multiple thinking. Overall, Julianne Moore's crying scenes are more compelling to watch, because she's more vulnerable of the three.</p></body></html>

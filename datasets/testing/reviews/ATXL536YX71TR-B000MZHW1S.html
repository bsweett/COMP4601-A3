<meta name="summary" content="First it was slaves,then ivory,then gold.....now it's diamonds!"></head><body><p>BLOOD DIAMOND is an extremely important film from the informational standpoint.Going as far back as the early 1800's white Europeans and native blacks from various tribes have been complicit in the raping and pillaging of the  land and it's people in Sierra Leone.Not only has there been the Belgian Colonial Rule in the past,but also there has been a savage Civil War that has existed among the numerous indigenous people.Innocent people have been caught in the crossfire over the years.(NOTE: this is the land from which the AMISTAD slaves were sold!)Flash forward and it is 1999, and Sierra Leone is still in the midst of chaos,but this time it is for the mining of illegal diamonds that are smuggled into Liberia and make their way to an important diamond merchant,Van de Kamp.Danny Archer( the always "give-it-your-all Di Caprio) is the mercenary diamond smuggler;Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is the journalist who wants to blow the smuggling  story wide open!;and Solomon Vendy (always amazing Djimon Hounsou)who is the innocent native who is captured by warring rebels.It is Vendy who has found the illusive 100-karat "pink diamond".All of these characters converge in a superb action-filled,swiftly paced race to "exploit" each other in some way;Archer wants the diamond;Bowen wants the story and Vendy wants his family back.The Thomas Newton Howard soundtrack is absolutely riveting as well as the excellent cinematography and smart editing.<br /><br />Where this film fails is in the inane dialogue.This is particularly true of the drek that is given to DiCaprio and Connelly.Two actors of such calibre deseved better than this.They do their best with it,but bad dialogue is bad dialogue! The story is terribly formulaic and a bit trite,and when everyone in Sierra Leone is getting killed,these characters always escape harm (of course they have to or the movie would have ended at the opening credits!).The film is just shy of three hours and much could have hit the cutting room floor.(I couldn't help noting that people in the audience began to fidget at the two-hour mark-I and my friends included!!!)<br /><br />Where this film succeeds is in the information that the viewer gains about the continuing exploitation of the Africas and the civil unrest that exists among it's own people.<br /><br />There is an excellent warning at the conclusion of the film for anyone who might be considering purchasing diamonds.<br /><br />All-in-all,not a bad flick,but not a great one either.</p></body></html>

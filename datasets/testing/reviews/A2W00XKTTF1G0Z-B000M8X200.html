<meta name="summary" content="Super DVD - Really!"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this DVD release from start to finsih. There are two version of the movie. Behind the scenes info and background information and the best part for me....<p>The original auditions for the casting of Lois Lane. Many now famous performers auditioned and didn't get the job that Margot Kidder did.<p>Watching the original uncut version with Christopher Reeve at his best was a gem. This DVD is definately worth it for the fans of the man in blue. Learning the insides from the commentary on costumes, sets and props. It was fun. ALso the intractive menus are very cool too. There's even an isolated soundtrack for the musical score by the ever popular John Williams.<p>I watched it several times on the first day!</p></body></html>

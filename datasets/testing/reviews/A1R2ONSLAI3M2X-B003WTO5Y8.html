There is not much more I can say that hasn't already been said about this movie!I think it will always stand out as an excellent thriller. I will say that Anthony Hopkins is simply Brilliant as Hannibal Lecter. There is no one else who could have played the role like he did, much less carry on 2 more movies..... Hannibal and Red Dragon. It is no wonder why he and Jodie Foster are both Oscar winners, for she gives an outstanding performance as Clarice Starling. Winner of 5 Academy Awards, this movie will always remain a true classic in every way. Hopkins is mezmorizing in his role. A non stop thriller with twists and turns that keep you glued to this movie. Hats off to Jonathan Demme for giving us a masterpiece than no one will ever forget!!</p></body></html>

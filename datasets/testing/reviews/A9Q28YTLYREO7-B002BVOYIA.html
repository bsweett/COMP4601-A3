<meta name="summary" content="Very Intense Film"></head><body><p>I got to watch this film recently&it truly just got at me very early on.it was said seeing what Power&force can do to a whole place.the Brutality&Loss of Lives was so Emotional.Don Cheadle was Great. he is One of the Most slept on Actors in the Business&after this Performance He won't be denied any longer.the whole Cast was truly in tune with the task at hand.when you watch a film as this you see the world differently&for whatever is happening in your world you just know that whatever you are dealing with isn't half of what is truly going on in the world.the saddest part after viewing this film is that this Genocide of a People all happened within the past 10-12 years which truly is Scary. a Must see film&this film should be taught at all schools.very intense film.</p></body></html>

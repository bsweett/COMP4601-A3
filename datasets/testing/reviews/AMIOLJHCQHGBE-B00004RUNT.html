Not every movie has social impact or is made to solve the world's problems. This is a Bruce sci-fi film. And I am a Sci-fi fan as well as a Bruce fan (Don't miss 6th Sense or Unbreakable as well as my all time favorite Armageddon). From the spectacular color (rivals Braveheart), the perfectly entwined soundtrack (if you've read my other reviews you know I'm huge on audio/visual), and the interpretation of the future (right there with Bladerunner), this DVD will enthrall you. While Americans are used to stark, hard edged angles in a sci-fi flick, the French director Luc Besson uses smoothed angles and brilliant colors to depict his futuristic vision. The depth of the city scenes equals Bladerunner. Best of all, he cast small bit part but recognizable actors in most roles which had me saying, &quot;I know those guys! Who are they?&quot; Mucho kudos to Gary Oldman who plays the greatest villian of the future! His performance ranks with  Alan Rickman (Die Hard, Quigly Down Under). Mila Jovovitch is fantastic as the unknowing savior of the human race (too bad she did Joan de Arc). There is plenty of tongue and cheek. My favorite is the druggy trying to rob Bruce (&quot;Give me the casssssssssshhhhh&quot; you have to see this). Chris Tucker plays Ruby Rod, a radio show host that is blantantly a spoof of Prince. Dresses better though. He is the perfectly flamboyant counterpart to Bruce's hero. Scatter in some strange humans, some violent aliens, Evil approaching the earth in the form of a planetoid, Oldman as the unwitting villian, and Bruce as the hero, and you would have a nice film. Add in exceptional color and a clashingly synchronistic soundtract that puncuates odd moments, and you have a DVD you must see. If you love Bruce like I do, own this. Trust me. I am never wrong.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Trish and the Creeper, will be back in Jeepers Creepers 3 . . ."></head><body><p>Writer/director Victor Salva's did intend to launch a monster franchise, but that's how things worked out, as his scary thriller Jeepers Creepers (2001), was successful enough to spawn the high action sequel Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003), and the third entry in the series Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral, is reportedly in production at this time.<br /><br />The strange being known as "The Creeper" (Jonathan Breck), is tremendously powerful, and has the ability to fly.  He surfaces every twenty three years, and for a period of twenty three days, driven his sense of smell, he consumes humans for their body parts.  Siblings Trish (Gina Philips) and Darry Jenner (Justin Long) are travelling in Florida, when they cross the path of the Creeper's vehicle.  Later, passing an abandoned church, they again spot the Creepermobile, and observe a huge figure, grabbing body shaped bundles from the back, and tossing them down a corrugated pipe in the ground.  The Creepermobile suddenly appears behind them, and runs them off the road.  Going back to the church to investigate, Darry makes a horrific discovery in an underground cavern.<br /><br />Daylight turns to darkness, while the pair awaits for police assistance.  Darry gets a phone call from a mysterious woman who warns him that something bad will happen, when he hears the song Jeepers Creepers.  The action ramps up when the Creeper gets Darry's scent, and will stop at nothing to satisfy his needs.<br /><br />With lots of intimate dialog, Salva does a wonderful job of making the relationship between Trish and Darry, seem very real and natural.  It is the central thread that holds the film together, and both Justin Long (Live Free, Die Hard) and Gina Philips (Ally McBeal) turn in strong performances.  Long goes overboard at times, but that is kind of what he does.  Philips was 31 at the time, but easily passes for much younger.<br /><br />The suspense is sustained, by keeping the Creeper obscured for most of the film.  Psychic Jezelle Gay Hartman (Patricia Belcher) provides key information about the creature, and a deadly prediction.  The ending is a bit unexpected, but remains true to Salva's vision.  Jeepers Creepers has its faults, but is still a well-crafted, and very effective monster movie.<br /><br />The double sided DVD release, is a comprehensive package, including both widescreen and full screen versions of the film, and lots of cool bonus materials.  Victor Salva, a longtime horror aficionado, provides a fun and informative commentary track, and there are also an excellent series of featurettes covering the making of the film.  Unfortunately, nothing is heard from executive producer Francis Ford Coppola.  If you like creepy monsters, check out this series, as Jeepers Creepers 2, picks up where the first film left off, delivering big time action.  Gina Philips will reprise her role as Trish, in the upcoming third entry in the series, Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral.</p></body></html>

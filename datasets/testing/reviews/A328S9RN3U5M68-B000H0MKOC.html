<meta name="summary" content="'In the end you have to pay the mortgage'"></head><body><p>The fact that everyone (well, almost) will do anything for money - the mortgage must be paid - is only one of the subversive elements placed on the table of this bitingly satirical film.  Based on the very edgy novel by Christopher Buckley, director Jason Reitman has adapted the story for the screen, populated his diatribe with a fine cast of actors, and directs the whole concept with deft precision. While many not familiar with the book's bite will be put off by the title, rest assured that no one escapes this exploration of the tobacco industry, the health industry, and the political industry unscathed.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart is spot on as the tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor, a man of style and spin who can talk his way through any confrontational encounter and come out the winner.  He is supported by the tobacco kings  Budd 'BR' Rohrbacher (J.K. Simmons) and 'The Captain' (Robert Duvall), the movie mogul Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), by his buddies in crime Maria Bello and David Koechner with similar lobbyist roles in alcohol and firearms, and confronted by Senator Finistirre (William H. Macy in another jewel of a role), ex-Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott), and journalist Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes). How he manages to make all of these folk satisfied with his message comprises the bulk of this flimflam man story, a tale that butchers the tobacco industry with the same vehemence as the anti-smoking brigade.<br /><br />The lines are fast and furious and Eckhart is superb in his role. Somehow the emphasis of the relationship and frothy philosophy sessions between Eckhart and his son (Cameron Bright - as monochromatic a child actor as there is in the industry today)  make the movie fairly boring just when is should be picking up momentum, but that is Hollywood covering its tracks.  Not a great movie, but a movie that is much better than you would expect!  Grady Harp, October 06</p></body></html>

So unnecessary, so irritating and soooo over dramatic and kill switch, volume off. Sure the dance numbers spectacular if not over done. I am a lover of musicals, old perfection: 'Till the Clouds Roll by, American in Paris, White Christmas, Jazz Singer,' Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, Scrooge (Albert Finney), Cabaret, Victor/Victoria, all amazing! Sound of Music, well not only best musical ever, unarguably, but one of the finest films ever made, Oliver! LOVED IT, Fiddler on the Roof (Topol I mean come on, EPIC!), the King and I (EPIC), even Sweeney Todd, awesome, Newsies FUN!, just fun.<br /><br />This was just f'in boring. JUST drill a hole in my skull boring. I consider myself a film fanatic. I loathe critics like AO Scott and the neanderthal moron Roger Ebert, so my opinion in the grand scheme of things is just words, but this was just garbage. (with all due respect to Gene Kelly of course).<br /><br />The last thirty minutes was so great, so well done, the singing and dancing were wonderful. I wish they had just shut their mouths when they weren't singing and dancing, because I know 11 year olds that could act better.<br /><br />Laughable, ostentatiously 'vanilla' Broadway robot acting, pretentious film.</p></body></html>

If you like the other two movies then you will love this one.  Watch it with some other people and watch it more than once.  After a couple of times you will pick up on jokes.  Many people hated this movie because they never caught the jokes.  Mike Myers comedy is a mixture of Mel Brooks, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray.  His movies won't even make any top 100 AFI lists but they make you laugh. Now the DVD is great.  The picture is bright and clear.  The sound is also very good.  I am not fond of the Infinifilm DVD's but they are ok.</p></body></html>

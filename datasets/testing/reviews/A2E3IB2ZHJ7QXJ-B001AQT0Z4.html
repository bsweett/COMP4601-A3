That's entirely true.  I really have never felt this passionate about a movie before, as well as Quentin Tarantino himself.  I will, and have, go to some lengths to defend.  Whether or not  Tarantino does or does not care about his fans, well, maybe he should tone down his quality in his movies if he doesn't want my exuberant praise (but I'll bet you anything he'll enjoy that notion).  It's your own fault, Tarantino!  While his other masterpiece, Reservoir Dogs is a bit more concise (and features monologues that are possibly better), Pulp Fiction is wild, never lets up, a bit more original (even though I don't like City on Fire, you got to give it credit for being a plot line).  And I love it! Not bad for a movie I thought would just be something I watch once then forget about it.<br /><br />Sure, Pulp Fiction sadly sometimes becomes the whipping boy of self-righetous, _________ film ________ who think they know everything (stupid ________), but those who love this movie know the other people are just too unfortunate to realize what an incredible movie this is.  Pulp Fiction, while not heavily stylized artistically (as in art direction), is first off, set in an arguably wonderland of crime-ridden LA.  That's all it needs to do, because Pulp Fiction takes no time in immersing you in the crime ridden world of Pulp Fiction.  As one critic noted (hey, I don't like critics but have no problem with the praise it gets), it's like entering a rabbit hole into LA, even moreso.  Your there in Jack Rabbit Slim's, chilling with Mia and Vincent, feeling the 50's "wax museum with a pulse". When Butch and Marsellus are being held captive by two really perverted dudes, your feeling (which is pretty wrong, props to Butch in the end) it with them (not exactly a good feeling, unless it's your fantasy or something.  Yeck).  You fall in love with your surroundings and the characters, not something that comes naturally for some movies.<br /><br />Some film buffs say that Tarantino's directing skills are a smorgasbord of "copied" camera techniques (like  even though this or this may not be true (but I really don't give a ______), I don't think the movie would be the same without them.  Besides, I've said before that Tarantino isn't the style master (David Fincher, Darren Afronsky, Tim Burton, and David Lynch for starters outwit him), but I still don't think there's single ordinary use of camera (well, maybe not).  His wide array of close up shots, tracking shots, and his knack for making facial expressions add to the characters believabiltiy really show that Tarantino knows how to direct.  Besides, True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawn show (Natural Born Killers was his, but Oliver Stone did a lot to it, it probably did not even look like a Tarantino movie anymore) that Tarantino's scripts ebenfit when he directs them himself.  His vision comes to full force when he's behind the camera.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is one of my favorite and most memorable.  Admittaley, I'm not surprised that each Thurman, Jackson, and Travolta were just nominated.  I didn't like Forest Gump but I feel that Tom Hanks was more accomplished, Uma Thurman wasn't quite the best, and Jackson faced tough competition from Martin Laundua from Ed Wood (another great performance from a great movie from that year).  However, although Travolta and Jackson did not win giving the competition, the all star cast is still one for the ages.  John Travolta's sagging career got a great revival with his best role to date, and Thurman's classiness makes for a believable Mia Wallace.  Samuel L Jackson's performance as Jules is also his most memorable ever, his sheer bad@$$ery, along with some of eh most quotable lines, makes him one of the most imitated and well-loved characters in the Tarantino canon.  As a matter of fact, there's no dull moment with Jackson.  But that's not all, either!  Christopher Walken's spot on portrayal as a veteran is significant despite his low screen time, and Bruce Willis's cementation as a bad @$$ mother_______ (no doubt from movies like Die Hard) rocks as well.  The rest of the cast rule, from Tim Roth (finally dropping the annoying fake American accent),  Amanda Plummer, Harvey Kietel, Rosanna Arquette, and the paranoid stoner portrayed by Eric Stoltz.  Lance is particulary well portrayed.  He's so paranoid and his exaggerated actions (watching him freak out after Vince crahses into his house is hilarious) Heck, even Tarantino's character, Jimmy, is funny.  Tarantino's isnt' the greatest actor (he was really annoying in Death Proof), but he's not half as bad as some people make him out to be.<br /><br />The crowning jewel of Pulp Fiction is, of course, the dialogue.  _________ Coen Brothers (the single most overrated film-makers on the planet) wish they could write dialogue as good as this (Fargo?  Oh please), or dialogue that's even remotely entertaining.  While his other movies are worthy of mention, none of them is jam packed with this much dialogue.  While admittaley, some of the lines are not exactly super-cool one lienrs in the vein of such lines as "Rosebud", "I'm gonna Make Him An Offer He Can't Refuse" or "You Talkin' To Me?", it transcends the one-liner notion.  Pulp FIction is the kind of movie where you quote whole bits of dialogue, with hardly any filler, and paying much attention to detail.  The characters themselves each talk in their own distinctive way, something that Roger Ebert himself noted.  Oh, and I've never as much fun swearing in my life in a Tarantino movie (because, I of course, talk along with the dialogue).<br /><br />Oh, and it probably has one of the best compilation soundtracks I've ever heard, but you probably already know that.  The soundtrack is used in the best way possible, and the movie itself doesn't benefit for a score, silence falls when needed, and the right music captures the right mood of the movie perfectly, whatever mood it's in.  Some of the dances are iconic, as well as the instant classic twist scene, as you all know of.  But many moments are highlighted and burned into your mind with the music tracks. From the theme of Misirlou and Jungle Boogie, Son of A Preacher Man, and the extensive use of Surf Rider at the end of the movie, these songs gain meaning when used in the movie (as well as any Tarantino movie), and add a hell of a lot to it.  The soundtrack proves that music beyond traditional film scores can, and do, highlight and create the exact same thing that traditinal film scores do so well.  It's not just meaning to be witty, it's just Tarantino's way of using music and what he chooses.  No wonder Paul Thomas Anderson creates so many scenes with popular music (I think they have a healthy rivarly, regarding the two).<br /><br />There are some petty criticisms for me, as the movie does fall a bit in the Gold Watch Segment,(especially during the pointless sex scene between Butch and Fabianne), but come on, the criticism were in one ________ sentence!  The two disc set is amazingly good, with a bevy of features and interesting articles (Roger Ebert especially).  It's all you wanted to know about such a well-made, fun movie.But anyway, Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece, and what I mean by masterpiece is it's done by a master, in a masterful way, and I _________ mean that _______________!  Needless to say, Pulp Fiction deserves to be much higher than in the 90's on AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, among the other established "classics" on that list.  That, and even higher in the IMDB list (Only 5?  Come On!).<br /><br />A</p></body></html>

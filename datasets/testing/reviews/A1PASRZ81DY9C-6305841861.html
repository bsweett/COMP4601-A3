Not only that the special effects get a lot of attention, it's the horror type found in Evil Dead 2 to be very appealing. The acting, again, is improved over also in Evil Dead 2. I consider Evil Dead 2 to be a remake and part of a sequel, in a very mild way, of The Evil Dead. Moreover, the story found in Evil Dead 2 is very good and much more campy than the first picture. Sam Raimi has allowed himself to shoot a very genuine horror picture with great amount of special effects. At first time I saw this picture, I thought it was a bore, but seeing it again, my opinion have changed. I've come to respect Evil Dead 2 and its prequel to be finest in horror genre. I couldn't think of a better independent horror picture in the same kind as Evil Dead 2. It's also amazing what I was seeing in Evil Dead 2 was done in absence of computer graphics commonly found in today pictures. All in all, Evil Dead 2 is a well done picture that deserves a lot of credit. By the way, notice that Bruce Campbell bears an eerily resemblance to Jim Carrey.</p></body></html>

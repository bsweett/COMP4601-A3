Really?"></head><body><p>"There Will Be Blood" tells the story of an early 20th Century oil tycoon, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his interactions with those around him, in particular, his son and a young preacher, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano).<br />"There Will Be Blood" has received much critical acclaim and is currently ranked at #107 in the IMdB Top 250, and yet, I just can't see why. Paul Thomas Anderson is a very good writer and director, as has been demonstrated by his earlier works "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia", but the sprawling character structure format Anderson used in his previous works, just doesn't work in this case. Instead, I just found "There Will Be Blood" to be overly long, depressing and unfocussed.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems with "There Will Be Blood" is that there just aren't enough major characters to sustain 2 ? hours of film. Whereas "Magnolia" must have had around a dozen major characters in it, "There Will Be Blood" only really has one, Daniel Plainview, and he isn't all that interesting. Daniel Plainview's character doesn't seem to change or develop at all for the duration of the movie. I think that one of the main purposes of this film is to show the interaction between Plainview and Eli Sunday (the interaction between capitalism and religion), but there aren't all that many scenes in which these characters interact and they are too spaced out to really have much of an impact (and in my opinion, don't adequately justify the ending of the film). I think that this film could have been greatly improved by trimming it down to around 100 minutes, so as to intensify the focus on these scenes.<br /><br />As with all of Anderson's movies, "There Will Be Blood" is beautifully filmed, but in a way, that makes it all the more frustrating. It's like a big, beautifully wrapped Christmas box that only contains a pair of socks. It definitely does not deserve all of the awards and nominations that it received. In my opinion, "Breach", which was released in the same year as "There Will Be Blood" and received virtually no nominations, is a much better written and acted movie (Chris Cooper was brilliant in "Breach", while Daniel Day-Lewis seemed to be almost overacting in this film) and whereas I doubt I will ever watch "There Will Be Blood" again, I suspect that my copy of "Breach" will be viewed many more times.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Strange movie but a good adventure"></head><body><p>Coraline has trouble getting used to her new home, one that she shares with a Mom and Dad who don't seem to have a lot time for her. The neighbors are weird and there isn't much around. So when she finds a doorway to another world, one that's like hers but better, she begins to get lured over to the other side...<br /><br />The animation is done really well and the storyline is for the most part consistent. I liked this film, even though it won't make my top tier in films. Some of the visuals are VERY strange, especially the show put on by the two ladies downstairs, but you should check this out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The real life story of zombies"></head><body><p>Finally, I ran across a film that is a true account of everyday life that shows zombies wandering the Earth.  Some Zombies are screaming about global warming, while others listen to junk bands like modest mouse.  Others even think that movies like crackback fountain are true.  George Clooney should be in this film because he is perhaps on of the best zombies to ever walk the earth in the last 20th century.  This film has Dennis Hopper in it, and we know he is not a zombie, so it is nice to see a human playing the role of a human.<br /><br />The movie is a wonderful showing of how the zombies that wander this planet continue to rule it.</p></body></html>

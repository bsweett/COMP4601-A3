<meta name="summary" content="A &quot;TRUE&quot; WESTERN EPIC!"></head><body><p>&quot;Open Range&quot; proves that there is still an audience to be found for the western. The film is a beautifully-shot, character driven film that puts less emphasis on visual effects and loads of action and focuses on a great story: that of two men forced to defend their property and their lives in a small western town! Robert Duvall is one of America's greatest actors, and proves it again in this film. Costner is highly underrated as an actor, and his performance here is of his finest. Annette Benning gives a great performance as well. The gunfight at the end of the film is one of the grittiest and most exciting sequences ever filmed! If you're ready to experience a &quot;true&quot; western epic, then saddle up for &quot;Open Range!&quot; Grade: A+</p></body></html>

It was good, but I'm not sure if it merits 4 whole stars, but it does deserve more than 3.<br /><br />So, Jamie Foxx is Max, an L.A. "part-time" (if 12 years can be considered part-time) cabbie who dreams of starting a limo service.  Tom Cruise is Vincent, a creepy contract killer who recruits Max to be his chauffeur for the night.  Vincent gives Max $600 and tells him that he has five stops to make, and then LAX.  If Max is a good driver, he'll give him an extra $100 in tips.  Vincent tells Max that he is in real estate and needs to get some signatures and visit some friends.  However, after the body of the first target falls onto Max's cab, Vincent kidnaps him and forces him to help him out or die defying him.<br /><br />The actors were both very good at portraying their characters, but it was the movie's score and camerawork that made it truly effective.  The music playing in the background was very good at either complimenting a certain scene, or providing a good contrary to the situation.  For example, while we are waiting for Vincent to kill his first victim, Max is listening to classical music, and it continues all the way until the body lands on the cab.  Also, the movie was shot in a "home movie" style, meaning that it was very unsteady and moved with the action.<br /><br />Sadly, the only major twist is easily guessed five minutes into the film, but the movie is still enjoyable.  While not the greatest movie I've ever seen, this is definitely the best I've seen in a while.</p></body></html>

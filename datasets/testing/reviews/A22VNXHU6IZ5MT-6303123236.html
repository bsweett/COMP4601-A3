<meta name="summary" content="The original Disney classic coming to Blu Ray!!!"></head><body><p>Mirror mirror on the wall,this is the Disney classic that started it all!,coming in a great Blu Ray + DVD package,so you can play in it on your Blu ray Player or a standard dvd player,always good to have choices,since I have BOTH Blu and dvd players in my home/van. This is sure to look and sound awesome on Blu!!! Heck the original 2 DVD set from years ago was no sloutch in the quality dept,this one should even be better! I Can't wait!!! FYI,there are also expensive deluxe Blu Ray versions being released as well for die hard fans,for me the thus version will do the job!!!</p></body></html>

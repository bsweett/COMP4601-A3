As a collection completist, I'm relieved to receive all of them at once and at a reasonable price.  The extras are superb.<p>I haven't noticed the framing problems others have mentioned, but I'll watch for them.<p>Muhammed Ali's appearance in the extras for Micheal Fox's Parkinsons fund-raiser was cute, too.  Good to see Ali again. (And fun to watch him punch out Fox.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Patriot Extended Edition on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>This has long been one of my favorite films and one that is often forgotten about when Mr. Gibson's resume comes up.  Never mind the bad press he has gotten over the years, he has still produced a credible body of work and The Patriot is certainly up there with his best.  This movie has been around for quite some time so no 'spoiler alerts' need be necessary.  The quality of audio is excellent and the use of surrounds gets a well deserved workout which I always appreciate.  Using uncompressed PCM I audio,  the shifts between the surrounds when appropriate were well blended and very distinct.  Really well done on that score.  The audio also was nicely balanced between the center channel dialogue and foley fx going to the sides or rears. Once you set your audio volume levels, you could just leave them alone.<br />The video quality was also excellent shifting between cool color grading in evening and early morning scenes and either deeply saturated or, in a couple of cases, desaturated for daytime and battle sequences.  The extended portions included were seamlessly done, that is all except one short time lapse scene at the end of Gibson's attack on the troops leading his son, Heath Ledger, away to be hanged.  I suppose this one small scene would lend itself to the 'ghost' name that was applied to his character but it was the one scene I felt could have been left out.<br />Deep blacks and strong details in the shadows support my contention for this high quality video rating as well as the lack of any grain or video noise or artificating.<br />Bottom line,  glad I have it.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thanks.</p></body></html>

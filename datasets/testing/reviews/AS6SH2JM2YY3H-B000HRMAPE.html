Mission Impossible III makes you wish you would own stock in the company that makes pyrotechnics for Hollywood!<br /><br />Although loyalty to friends and family is a reoccurring theme throughout, the focus is on action... action to capture the bad guys and rescue the good guys.  The movie begins with the penultimate chapter... a scene just before the end.  What a technique... you see this ending coming at you and you can't envision a way out!<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />*  Tom Cruise running his 1000 meters through a crowded sidewalk.  Just how fast WAS he running?<br /><br />*  The escape of the bad guy from the convoy.  Remember True Lies?<br /><br />*  Fiance getting mad.  "Point and shoot... It's that simple."<br /><br />*  Helicopter chase through the wind farm.<br /><br />*  Synergy of MI force team members.<br /><br />Rated LOE for Lots Of Explosions.  Not your typical "weak women are exploited while strong males come to the rescue."  The women are tough.<br /><br />All in all, great action entertainment.</p></body></html>

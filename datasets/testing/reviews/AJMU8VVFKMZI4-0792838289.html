Like what the heck was Janet Leigh doing in the film?  Her first scene with Ben had absolutely NO chemistry.  In fact, I think Ben only looked at her twice.  He really looked like he wished she would go away.  And what was the whole bit about her name?  Just wasted screen time.  What was the point of the Korean guy coming to work for Shaw?  And if they (The Communist Party) had the whole platoon there why didn't they train all of them to be killers?  10 controlled killers beats the hell out of one.  I kept waiting for someone to *access* Ben as well.  Why did his nightmares stop?<br /><br />How Robert and Joselyn met had me rolling my eyes.  He was bitten by a snake and she just happened to bycling by with ointment???<br /><br />Shaw was just a weak-minded momma's boy and Ben...well, I don't know what to make of him.  He was removed from post and then he wasn't.  There are only two good scenes in the whole film and one great performance by Angela Lansbury.</p></body></html>

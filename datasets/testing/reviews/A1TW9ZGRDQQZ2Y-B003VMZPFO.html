Romero's original film, but from the reviews I've read, this remake is even better in the eyes of many.<br /><br />Basically, half the inhabitants of a small town, with a population of 1,260, start killing off family members and neighbors. It's hard to describe what happens next without giving anything away, so I'll just comment on the other aspects. It reminded me a little of 28 Days Later, mainly in the fact that the people are not zombies. They are infected by a kind of virus and have turned murderous because of it. There are quite a few scenes that are genuinely creepy and more than a few of those cheesy jump scares, but thankfully The Crazies stays grounded in reality, making the impact of what's going on that much more intense. There are a couple of instances where I was thinking that some of the people were idiots for doing things I wouldn't dream of in such a situation, but hey, it's a horror movie. The pacing drags slightly at times, but they were sure to put just enough surprises around the corner to keep your interest. The acting is what you would expect. Not grand, but not weak by any means. Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell carry most of the burden and do enough to make you care what happens to them by the end. The gore level is strong, just not the splatterfest level that you might expect.<br /><br />The Crazies is not one you have to rush out and see, but it's well worth your time when it hits DVD. I happen to agree with most critics in this case, because it's definitely one of the smarter horror remakes I've seen.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

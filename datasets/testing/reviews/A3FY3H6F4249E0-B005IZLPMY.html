It was no award winner--just good entertainment and on an incredibly humid 105 degree day in Baltimore (yuk).  I don't remember any foul language either.  It was a war movie, so people got shot and killed everywhere, but they did not focus on blood and guts, thank God!  I saw it in 3D, but I don't believe the 3D really added much.<br /><br />Steve Rogers, from Brooklyn NY, is a guy who wants to join the military and serve his country so bad he can taste it.  It is March, 1942, so WWII is going strong.  Steve is pretty small and "puny," and gets rejected 4F every time he applies.  He is in the right place at the right time when a scientist overhears him about to apply again and decides Steve is perfect for a secret government experiment.  Steve is classified 1A by Dr Abraham, given a special serum injection, and he becomes a lean-mean (muscular) fighting machine.  His metabolism is about 4 times faster than other guys, his muscles are expanded at the cellular level, and he can run fast as heck, jump on top of taxis, and stuff like that.  We are told early on that the puny guy was selected because he had a good heart and the serum amplifies the inner characteristics a person already has.  Initially, Steve becomes part of a War Bond show for the army, but as you would have guessed anyway, soon finds a way to get in the war.<br /><br />The evil force is Nazi Johann Schmidt (aka Red Skull), who is looking for a way to win the war for Germany and Herr Hitler.  Tommy Lee Jones is a military commander, also involved in the secret project, and as always, is exceptionally good in his role.  Federal Agent Peggy provides an Army Girl presence, quite capable of kicking butt. There is also a pleasing innocence about Steve's character.<br /><br />Lots of action--It is probably more of a "guy" movie (generally) because it is primarily a war movie.</p></body></html>

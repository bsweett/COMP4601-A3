It has a fast pace, lots of action, many funny one liners and a great cast. It's a long movie but doesn't seem long because there is so much going on. I was not bored once. Depp was HOT, Knightly was hot and the ending left me hoping that part 3 will come out soon! True, it's not a realistic movie and the fight scenes are really far fetched but it's a fun movie and I was entertained. There are some gross scenes and it's slightly scary but for kids who can handle it, it's a really a great family movie and also a great date movie with something for guys and gals alike. Some might find this movie childish but if you are looking for something light-hearted and funny that will be good for all ages, this is the movie for you!</p></body></html>

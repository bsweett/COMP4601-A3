<meta name="summary" content="The Year the Earth Stood Still"></head><body><p>In 1992 a new kid moved into my high school.  He and his family had been missionaries in Africa, specifically Kenya and Rwanda.  We became friends.  Two years later as the rest of the world ignored the genocide that was occurring in Rwanda, I watched some of the suffering my friend had to go through.  People he had known, went to school with, worked with, and played were now dead and there was nothing he could do about it.<br /><br />HOTEL RWANDA is a movie that tells the story of Paul Rusesabagina, a sort of modern day Oskar Schindler, who used his influence, contacts, and limited funds to save the lives of thousands of Tutsis refugees by housing them in the Milles Collines Hotel that he managed in Rwanda.<br /><br />For historical reasons that really were insignificant, the Hutus in Rwanda came to power and using the military available to them began an extermination of Tutsis.  In a period of just three months over one-million Tutsis were executed by the Hutus.  Many of Tutsis women were raped before being killed and family homes that had stood for generations were completely destroyed.  The Tutsis appealed to the world at large, specifically the United Nations.  However, for the most part, the world sat silent as a massive genocide not seen since the days of Hitler took place.  The Tutsis people were left to defend for themselves and the HOTEL RWANDA became their only refuge.<br /><br />HOTEL RWANDA captures a glimpse of the despair, frustration, and isolation that many people in Rwanda felt in those bleak days of 1994.  Don Cheadle gives an Oscar-worthy performance portraying Paul Rusesabagina.  It is rumored that the film's producers tried to get everyone from Denzel Washington to Wesley Snipes to portray Rusesabagina, but director Terry George insisted from the beginning that Cheadle was the man for the part and in the end his choice was correct.<br /><br />HOTEL RWANDA is a moving film portraying how the courage, compassion, and conviction of one person can make a difference in the world.  At the same time, the movie is somewhat somber because it reminds us that though the events that happened in Rwanda in 1994 were unusual because of the massive scale of murder that happened in such a short time, the events themselves really aren't that unusual and are a reality that many people in Africa have to face everyday.  Events similar to what happened in Rwanda are happening right now in Uganda, Nigeria, and other African nations.  Except for in Nigeria, because of their relatively large oil reserves, the rest of the world ignores the horrors that happen in these nations.  HOTEL RWANDA is a film that works incredibly well because it forces viewers to taste their guilt for idly sitting by and doing nothing as a continent rips itself apart.  There aren't very many films that can do that and do it so well.</p></body></html>

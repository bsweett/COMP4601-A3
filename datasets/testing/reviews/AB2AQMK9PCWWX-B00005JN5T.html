<meta name="summary" content="La Barb, Rain Man, DeNiro and Moses have the most fun...."></head><body><p>....I could use an entire film with father and mother Focker--Hoffman and Barb--because they definitely seem to enjoy their work here and it shows. La Barb is a bit zaftig here but that's okay, she still comes off as The Owl and the Pussycat kinda sexy.<br /><br />Hoffman's throwaway lines ('Can you believe I concieved him with one testicle?) are terrific. And the dog which 'humps everything that moves' who is flushed down the RV's terlit...funny, funny. Alas though. Stiller and Polo didn't seem to want to join the party as they kinda telegraphed in their acting. Oh, well...see it for the synergy of Striesand, DeNiro and Hoffman. You'll enjoy them.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Let Me Tell You of William Wallace...""></head><body><p>Hopefully, the furor over THE PASSION will not obscure this, Gibson's masterful account of the life and death of Scottish patriot William Wallace. Short on facts but long on legend, BRAVEHEART is an epic in the grand style of David Lean, possibly the best character biodrama since LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.<br /><br />This Academy-Award winning film, Gibson's directorial debut, is lavish, colorful, and long. Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is mythic, but threaded with a fine appreciation of the human frailties of Wallace, who led his countrymen in a protracted War of Independence against English rule in the early 1300s.<br /><br />Gibson's Wallace is balanced, a leader amongst men who accepts his role and the attendant lionizing that accompanies it, with bemusement and wit. The character of Wallace is nearly the perfect man, being forceful, ruthless, civilized, passionate, crafty, educated, and sensitive as the occasion demands. His slow downfall in the second half of the film (and his horrible death) are envisioned not as failures in the man but as born of a need to believe, even in the face of the treachery and self-interest of others.<br /><br />The Scottish nobles are drawn as amoral and torn between alliance with England and a fractious independence (as they historically were). Although they fail Wallace miserably, he is so convinced of the rightness of his cause that he returns time and again to them to bolster his military and political clout. The vicious betrayal of Robert The Bruce (and his ultimate redemption) is a plot within a plot, and is played beautifully by Angus McFadyen.<br /><br />Gibson's vision of the battle scenes, drawn as they are with hundreds of extras, screaming horses, and gore enough for a teenage "slaughter" movie, are singularly exciting and propel the film forward at a literal gallop. The bloody-handed Wallace is a vision in violence and determination, and ultimate passion.<br /><br />Fine performances are supplied by Patrick MacGoohan as King Edward "Longshanks" Plantagenet, Sophie Marceau as the Princess of Wales/French King's daughter, and by Catherine McCormack, who plays Wallace's wife Murron. Murron, and her memory, animate Wallace, and therefore, animate the film. McCormack is angelic and sensual by turns as need demands and carries this brief but crucial role with grace.<br /><br />BRAVEHEART is creatively fictionalized history and fine inspiration. It is a story in which, as Wallace says: "Every man dies...not every man really lives."</p></body></html>

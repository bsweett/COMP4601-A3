<meta name="summary" content="I want you to make a choice..."></head><body><p>I had been told by a few people who had seen the movie that it was laughable and in no way frightening, yet other reviews here on Amazon seemed to speak from a different standpoint.  So, as a true fan of terror on film, I had to judge for myself.<br /><br />I found the plot to be quite creative and intriguing.  The scenarios Jigsaw stages are intricate, alarming and bizarre- leaving his victims to make terrifying choices in order to survive his "game".<br /><br />At the opening to this movie, you are thrown straight into the thick of things.  The movie begins with two men chained to pipes in a dilapidated room, with a dead man lying in the middle of the floor.  The story then slowly and deliberately begins to unravel, with each man ultimately learning why he is there.  Danny Glover is introduced soon after as an investigator on the Jigsaw case.  Cary Elwes surprised me in this role, showing a far darker side than he's ever before revealed on-screen.<br /><br />The movie is suspenseful and interesting, with a good and somewhat startling ending.  It turned out to be far better than I was told it would be.  I'm glad I decided to see for myself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An interesting voyage."></head><body><p>The Next Generation cast has had one really good movie so far, and this is it. Captain Picard squares off against his old enemies the Borg as they try to assimilate Earth of the past.<p>The concept is well though out, and there are some great ideas going through the story as well. Misplaced hero worship. The ironic twist of Picard as Captain Queeg (since that was to be his next role following this). <p>But as usual, the movie falls apart when they try to do comic bits. Star Trek excels when the humor comes from the character interaction, not from jokes about &quot;taking a leak.&quot;<p>Patrick Stewart leads the familiar cast, adding Alice Krige to the mix as the heretofore unknown Borg Queen.<p>Great concepts.... adequate execution.</p></body></html>

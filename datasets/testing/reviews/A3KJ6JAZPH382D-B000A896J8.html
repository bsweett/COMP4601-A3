First off, he seems to be taking the least liberties with the history of events here. (Even if you want to refer to legends as history.) Orlando Bloom, who seemed to do little more in "Troy" than look like a chick magnet for Helen, has a lot more to do here and carries himself well as the unwilling action hero. The battle scenes are terrific (as you would expect from Scott's exceptional "Gladiator").<br /><br />What really carries "Kingdom Of Heaven" is the supporting cast. Liam Neeson gives his role as Balian's father gravitas, Kings Baldwin (Edward Norton, who does receive recognition in the DVD's credits) and Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) offer the moral center with Tibereus (Jeremy Irons) as the pivot between the good of these men versus the blood-hungry Knights Templar as well as the more eager generals among Saladin's forces.<br /><br />Detriments? Well - there are a couple. The sole two female characters here serve no real purpose other than to give the men something to move the plot along with. Saladin has a sister who appears long enough to get captured and (since you never see anymore of her other than Reynaldo {Brendan Gleeson} tearing away her veil) have something awful done to her. Eva Green seems to exist as the Queen of Jerusalem merely to add a love triangle. "Kingdom Of Heaven" is a guy movie, and the fight scenes outweigh the need for female character development. But Scott is too good a director for that, so all the warriors, good and bad, operate at a level other than spouting lines before battle.<br /><br />The moral compass of this movie is also solid. While some reviews here are argumentative about Saladin being "such a good guy for a Muslim," a movie like this (or "Troy" and "Alexander") can't work without the leaders being noble, even as the underlings plot around them. If we weren't at war, would the movie still look the same? My guess would be yes. The idiots that are too full of themselves to look at reality would still march off and get slaughtered, Jerusalem would have still fallen (even if historically the surrender was bloodier and more costly - Saladin reputedly took the wealthier of Jerusalem's citizens for ransom before allowing them 'safe passage' out), and the good guy would still get the girl. If the movie's end proves anything, we are still gullible to our own fanaticism; Richard The Lionhearted rides off to attempt to reclaim Jerusalem for the crown and the cross.<br /><br />One of 2005's best, and I have a feeling "Kingdom Of Heaven" will gain in stature as the years pass.</p></body></html>

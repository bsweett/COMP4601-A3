That's the feeling I got after it was over.<br /><br />I actually watched this movie about four years ago, and tonight decided to watch it again after realizing I never bothered to submit a review.<br /><br />The plot felt really incomplete.  That's obviously the main problem.  You have six young adults in their early to mid 20's running through the woods and climbing trees and watch towers trying to avoid these... really ugly and disgusting looking murderous critters.  Actually they're half people and half trolls or whatever.  They navigate through the woods during the day and night holding torches in the air and killing innocent people using shotguns and bows.<br /><br />Of course you know what to expect as far as a plotline is concerned- everybody is going to die, eventually... except for one or two of the lucky ones.  And that's exactly what happens.<br /><br />I just felt the film didn't provide enough suspense and was totally predictable, however some of the kills were gruesome enough to justify a watchable movie.  A good example of lacking suspense is in the beginning when everybody was walking around on back roads.  Nothing memorable happened here because the entire segment rushed forward too quickly.  In real life, walking down back roads definitely provides an uncomfortable feeling, but the writers apparently felt it wasn't necessary to include such a creepy feeling in the movie.<br /><br />Another problem is suspense included when it's not needed, such as the log cabin where the creatures were living.  The young adults decided to hide inside the cabin when it was discovered they wouldn't be able to escape the moment they looked outside and noticed that the troll creatures were pulling up in the driveway.  This scene felt WAY overlong.  Let's not forget the entire "make our way across the top of a huge, maze-like tree" segment that appears later on.  It was incredibly too long as well.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad film, but it was certainly in desperate need of having more time devoted to it to increase the suspense factor.</p></body></html>

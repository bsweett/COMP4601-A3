<meta name="summary" content="A Flawed Masterpiece From the Coens"></head><body><p>"No Country for Old Men" is the best Coen Brothers film since "Fargo." Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, this existential modern-day western features knockout performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem (a classic villain despite the Beatle haircut). Though excessively violent, the movie provides a disturbing meditation on uncompromised evil within its cat-and-mouse framework. When the Coens go full throttle, the results are exhilarating. However, Joel and Ethan occasionally stumble in their over-faithfulness to McCarthy's source material. Another misstep is the needless subplot involving Woody Harrelson's sharp-dressed bounty hunter. Kelly Macdonald, on the other hand, makes the most of her limited screen time as Brolin's devoted wife. Admittedly not for all tastes, "No Country for Old Men" is a flawed masterpiece that defies convention.</p></body></html>

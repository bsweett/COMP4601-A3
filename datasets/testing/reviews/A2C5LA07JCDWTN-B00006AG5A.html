<meta name="summary" content="Run of the Mill Action Flick but The Rock Oozes Potential"></head><body><p>There are no more action heros. Really. Arnold is washed-up. Stallone is making straight to video movies. The Rock oozes with potential to be the next great action hero. The Scorpion King is nothing more than a showcase for The Rock's vast talents. He is not just muscle-bound but witty and even downright funny in many scenes. This guy has got charisma and style, now he just needs the substance. The Scorpion King is filled with almost every tired action film cliche yet The Rock still carries this film on his back to respectibility. Just think, this is his 1st starring role...the potential is unlimited. As for The Scorpion King, the action scenes are good except for the last battle scene and the sandstorm scene which are great. Overall, this is entertaining mindless fun for action buffs or wrestling fans. Recommended.</p></body></html>

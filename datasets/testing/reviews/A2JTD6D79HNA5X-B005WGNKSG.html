The only other swedish film i seen many times was "Let the right on it". maybe i seen other swedish films, whatever.<br /><br />I like this movie a lot. I didn't expect some of what I saw and i didn't start reading the book until after i saw the movie. I really like the character Lisbeth Salander. She's cool and got some wicked style going on.<br /><br />I'll watch this movie again in due time though it is a little long i have to admit.</p></body></html>

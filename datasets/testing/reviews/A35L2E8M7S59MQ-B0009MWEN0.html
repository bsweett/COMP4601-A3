<meta name="summary" content="Has its moments, but doesn't really deserve the title"></head><body><p>Starship Troopers is a big budget action film set in a science-fiction based future where most of society is military based, and to be considered a citizen you must serve in the Terran Mobile Infantry.  This is of course based on the classic sci-fi/military novel written by Robert A. Heinlein nearly fifty years ago, which was under the same name.  The name is pretty much where the similarities between the movie and the book end.<br /><br />The plot to this film adaptation of this sci-fi classic is not handled very respectfully, Director Paul Verhoeven's sense of satire coming across as being very out of place when I first saw the film.  I was wondering if whoever owned the rights to the book knew what they were doing to the material, because I'm sure Heinlein would NOT have approved of the end result.<br /><br />I've come to accept the satirical aspects of this film, but I don't understand why they'd mock the book, as opposed to making it into an actual movie.  I get laughs out of this movie, the action is fun, though simplistic, but as an adaptation of the novel it fails on multiple levels.  I put the novel down feeling it was one of the best books I'd ever read.  When I left this film it felt like I did after every B-action film you see on an average basis; just nothing that left an impact on me like the book did.<br /><br />Total Recall and RoboCop were both handled better in regards to mixing action, sci-fi, and satire.  Starship Troopers tries hard to be those films, but ultimately fails.  Even if it wasn't supposed to be an adaptation of that novel, it still doesn't have the charm of those previous Verhoeven films.  They made us laugh at the depictions of society, as well as draw us in with engaging characters.  You don't care about any of the characters here, because they're all cardboard cut-outs and clich&eacute;s, not worth anyone's time.  Out of all the movies disappointed me, this one is up there as one of my biggest let-downs.<br /><br />I really have nothing much left to say, other than I was incredibly disappointed by Verhoeven, and the production team for not providing a better film.<br /><br />6/10 stars</p></body></html>

And this is, precisely the main default: there were too unfinished many details and the cast direction was really terrible.<br /><br />Let's start with the FBI female agent: simply unbearable; I really couldn't believe it: this role was a fundamental piece in this puzzle script and facing her with Denzel Washington the difference increased exponentially: inexpressive and extremely flat acting without hues.<br /><br />What happened with Meryl Streep? This character wasn't understood; the perversity, cruelty level and moral depravation shown by Langsbury can not be reduced to a cynical smile and some frenetic raptures. The audience does not know anything about her past; there wasn't a simple flash back about her relationship with her husband; Streep was extremely monochromatic, vapid if you want if you consider her actress status, she seemed to be absolutely absent. I just think in three actresses who perhaps could match with this extremely complex role: Jessica Lange would have been my first choice, Glenn Close (Dangerous liaisons and Fatal Attraction are enough evidences she likes and even handles those border edge roles), or Helen Mirren.<br /><br />What's up with the implant as dramatic support?, insipid and imprecise.<br /><br />What about with the wasted talent of Mr. Voight?  his lines seem be written by a personal enemy. The dramatis personae about a crisis of such magnitude were not polished at all.The dialogues do not reflect the real magnitude of what's goin' on.<br /><br />In the other hand, Denzel saves the game with his undeniable talent but it wasn't enough. Roland Shaw character was OK but Demme doesn't feel comfortable with this political thriller. I just can think in three directors that know this land and domain the multiple involved implications: Phillip Noyce , Wolfang Petersen and Oliver Stone.<br /><br />Finally the pretentious twist of fate of the original script at the end of the film, was a true anticlimax.<br /><br />It would not be fair to compare this remake with Frankheimer's original. It would be a sin and besides an insult!</p></body></html>

When he discovers the Dolphin Hotel has a room responsible for numerous fatalities he can't resist the challenge of spending the night.  The hotel manager, Mr. Olin (Samuel Jackson) tries to talk him out of it, literally begs him to forego the night's stay but Enslin won't hear of it.  Enslin may write about the paranormal, but he doesn't actually believe in it.  Needless to say, room 1408 will change all of that.  Things start slow and then get progressively nasty as the room torments him relentlessly.<br /><br />John Cusack gives an excellent performance as burned out Mike Enslin.  As we learn more about his past involving the death of his child and his failed marriage, Cusack does a great job of conveying the emotions of his shattered character.  Samuel Jackson is also strong as Olin.  He's strong, poised, and believable as an upscale hotel manager.  The two actors also work well onscreen together.  In some ways, the highlight of the movie is early on when they go head-to-head in Olin's office.<br /><br />Like any good horror movie, things start off slow and then the tension starts to build.  There are plenty of creepy happenings, some "gotcha" jump moments, and the underlying story is more than interesting.  The ending is fairly inventive and satisfying.<br /><br />Those interested in the original short story by Stephen King that inspired this movie can find it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743457358">Everything's Eventual : 14 Dark Tales</a>.  The movie is similar up to a point but goes in its own direction for most of the second half.<br /><br />My criteria for a horror film are simple.  If I feel plenty of tension from the suspense of what will happen next and it doesn't completely gross me out with gore, then it's a winner.  In this case, the tension is definitely there, the gore is almost nonexistent, and the characters are far more compelling than we normally see in horror movies.</p></body></html>

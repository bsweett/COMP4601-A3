They've also done this for The Day After Tomorrow and I, Robot in order to promote Fantastic Four in theaters. Fox is also re-releasing Dodgeball on DVD with one minute of extra footage, but no new features. There are also rumors that Fox will be re-releasing Die Hard Collector's Edition sometime this year or next to tie in to the release of Die Hard 4.0 (whenever it finally gets made, that is). It seems Fox has reversed -- they used to release Special Editions first (Fight Club, Big Trouble in Little China), then stop making those and release one-disc versions. Now, they do the opposite. They release one-disc versions and then months later release two-discs. Europe does not. Here in the UK, I Robot and Man on Fire were given two-disc treatments from the very beginning.<br /><br />Also, Miramax is releasing a barebones, no special features edition of SIN CITY in August, but they've already confirmed that a Special Edition is planned for Christmas '05. That's four months after the initial release. Why can't they just get it right the first time instead of suckering us all out of our hard-earned cash?<br /><br />I do like this DVD and it's not the cash-in I thought it would be (hey, it comes with an insert, how rare is THAT these days?!). But it's still not right and I refuse to buy I Robot and the others, just to make a point. I hope we'll soon learn and stop this ridiculous marketing ploy.<br /><br />It was bad enough when old releases were given Special Editions right after we bought the old DVDs, but to release Special Editions of brand new films mere months after they've been released for the very first time is a real shame.<br /><br />My advice is this: Do not buy any single-disc new release Fox DVDs, because chances are later down the road there'll be a Special Edition.</p></body></html>

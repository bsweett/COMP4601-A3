<meta name="summary" content="You will lose yourself in this film"></head><body><p>No Country for Old Men is a great movie. While I liked Fargo, this is the Coen's best movie. The acting and directing is flawless. First off, Javier Bardem is one of the most fearsome villians to grace the movie screens. He can just look at the camera and it will freak you out. He should be getting a best supporting actor Oscar next year for sure. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones were fantastic as well. Heck, even all the little side character seemed very natural, like they weren't even acting. I did have a few problems with the abrupt ending, but the movie as a whole fit together just right.<br /><br />I see why the critics are raving, and if you haven't already, you should see too.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

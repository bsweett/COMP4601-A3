The third installment of this trilogy had a few surprises up its sleeve: notably, the incredible cast, secondly that it's a very worthy continuation of the other two (a lot of people were expecting it to fail dramatically).<br />This time around it's Lecter back to his coaching methods again as he directs an FBI agent (Edward Norton) to find the &quot;tooth fairy&quot; killer (Ralph Fiennes).<br />The new elements in this film compared to its predecessors are that it contains more fear, more intimidation, and less dosages of dark humor. All these work in a positive way: they are not overblown out of proportion, in fact the film is superbly balanced throughout.<br />And, speaking of balance, the biggest trick is balancing big time actors like Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes and of course Hopkins himself. Indeed, it's not Hopkins that dominates the proceedings here (even though it's impossible to even think of ignoring his presence) but Fiennes portraying the psychoting serial killer that the &quot;doctor&quot; is helping to track down. Fiennes gives a memorable (and tone setting) performance in one of his very best roles of his career.<br />Fiennes's performance helps shift the focus point from Lecter in an overwhemling way. Aided by Norton's subtle but ultra-convincing acting the whole film becomes a classic not only for fans of the Hannibal trilogy but for fans of the genre in general. Keitel is great in his rather small role and it goes without saying that Hopkins maintains his reputation as one of the all-time classic cinematic psychos.<br />The script is very well-crafted and maintains the suspense and the &quot;edginess&quot; from beginning to end, but what really does the trick are the dark optics that accompany it particularly the sequences involving Fiennes and his horrifying deeds.<br />As it has been mentioned already &quot;Red Dragon&quot; can be viewed either as a sequel to &quot;Hannibal&quot; or a prequel to the previous two parts. But even if viewed as a sequel it's actually incredible when you think that it could've been a disaster especially because of the hype prevailing the other two films before it. It's far from that, it's simply a great film.</p></body></html>

Corpse Bride, his latest release, is a worthy, if minor, addition to his catalog.<br /><br />Victor van Dort (Johnny Depp) is the son of a nouveau riche family, who plan to marry him to destitute nobility in order to increase their status in the world. While he's not terribly fond of the idea, that changes when he meets Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), his prospective bride. His in-laws aren't much to write home about, but it doesn't matter; he's smitten. During the rehearsal, he is nervous, clumsy, consistently flubbing his lines and movements, and he flees into the forest to contemplate his cold feet. While practicing, he uses a convenient branch to practice slipping the ring onto Victoria's finger. The problem is, it's actually the skeletal and of the nameless titular character (Helena Bonham-Carter), who rises from the grave and claims that, since he said the vows, the two of them are now married. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Victor's prospective in-laws are fuming over his disappearance, while the mysterious wedding guest Lord Bittern (Gosford Park's Richard E. Grant) has his designs on marrying the lovely Victoria for himself.<br /><br />Despite the above, this is actually a simple, straightforward film. The voice acting is quite nicely done, the songs are enjoyable, the pace moves right along. Remind you any of The Nightmare Before Christmas? It should. Burton isn't trying anything new here; he's taken a new story and stuck it into the proven structure. It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's good. Not great, but good. *** &#65533;</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""You Think You Were The Only Team?" ~ Caught In A Web Of Intrigue"></head><body><p>`Munich' (2006) is a powerful, intense, sobering and complex examination into the unseen world of international espionage and political revenge. If you enter into viewing this film with a pre-conceived worldview or mindset that is wired to accept only clearly defined categories such as black and white, right and wrong, good and evil and them and us, fasten your seatbelt and prepare for a paradigm shift.<br /><br />The film begins with the massacre of the Israeli athletic squad at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany by the PLO and moves on from that heart wrenching historical event to weave a fictional tale of Israel's response through a convert scheme to hunt down and assassinate those responsible. At first it seems self evident as to which side is justified in their endeavor and which side deserve no reprieve from their impending punishment.<br /><br />However as the web of intrigue deepens, ethics tested and unavoidable compromises made the line between the righteous and the unrighteous slowly begins to blur and ultimately disappear. Matters are further complicated by the discovery of other covert groups, political and non political, with agendas that may hamper the Israeli game plan.<br /><br />The viewer will have much to consider by the end of the film. All the traditional questions such as "those who live by the sword, die by the sword', or "violence begets violence" come to mind as well as new ones that maybe you haven't considered. Emotionally and mentally drained by the time the credits roll by one is ultimately one is left to wonder if there is any answer to the eternal cycle of hatred and violence at all.</p></body></html>

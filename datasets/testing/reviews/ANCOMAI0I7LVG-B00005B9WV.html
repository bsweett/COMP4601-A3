<meta name="summary" content="Breathtaking beauty meets poignant material in this spellbinding masterpiece..."></head><body><p>This is one of the first `foreign language films' I'd ever seen, and while it didn't strike me immediately, it wore on me to the point where I now an enamored by it.  It's a truly universal and commercial film.  Everyone that I know likes it, even if they refuse to watch films with subtitles as a rule.  This seems to be everyone's exception.  I haven't seen this much universal appeal for a foreign film since, the only one coming close would have to be `Pan's Labyrinth'.<br /><br />Personally, `Wo Hu Cang Long' is a film that gets better with time and certainly lives up to its rich reputation.<br /><br />The film is really a richly detailed amalgam of cinematic influences, each strand of the films fibers coming together effortlessly to weave an unforgettable experience.  Part epic love story, part mystery, part Asian kung-fu movie, part dramatic social commentary; Ang Lee marvelously shifts the film `ever so slightly' so as to capture everything needed to convey every thought and emotion without coming across awkward, choppy or forced.  The film has a needed `breezy' appeal that carries you from scene to scene, but it never makes light of the films weighty subject matter.<br /><br />While catering towards the emotional resonance of the film (the film may be about the pursuit of a legendary sword, but the focus is not on the sword at all) Ang never forgets the films he is paying homage to, and so he beautifully renders each scene with an edge and intensity that establishes this film as one of the best martial arts pictures ever made.<br /><br />Certainly the best of this past decade.<br /><br />With a powerfully effective cast (both Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi are Oscar worthy here), these fight sequences are elevated from brainless fun to startling emotion driven works of art.  You can understand why these battles are taking place and you can see the personalities of these characters taking shape throughout.  Ziyi is marvelous here, and her character development some of the best of the year (that character was a goldmine).  Her arrogant tonal shifts are just mesmerizing and unbelievably focused.<br /><br />And let's just take a moment of silence to bask in our awe of that brilliantly choreographed bamboo tree battle (one of many breathtaking fight sequences in this film).<br /><br />Yes, `Wo Hu Cang Long' is a stunning film that totally lives up to the hype and delivers more and more with every viewing.  It is one of those films that I grow more and more in love with every time I watch it.  For all the edge and attitude it possesses, this film is one of the most graceful and elegant films I've ever seen.</p></body></html>

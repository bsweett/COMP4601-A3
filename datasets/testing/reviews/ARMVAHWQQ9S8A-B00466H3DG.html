I've come to expect excellence from Charlie Kaufman, who always makes seemingly unfilmable plots into a brilliant screenplay.  Michel Gondry, who directed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000714E6">Human Nature</a>, directs with sensitivity and ambition, making the visual effects of memories being lost look realistic.  The casting choices were unusual but perfect, allowing a group of talented actors to step out of their comfort zones and show how good they truly are.  The leads, Jim Carey and Kate Winslet, are perfectly chosen.  Carey plays the quiet, intelligent, Kaufman-like guy who doesn't know how to interact with others with Winslet playing the arty, rough, daring girl who opens up his world and shatters it down the road with an impulsive decision.  The supporting cast, Kirsten Dunst speficially, also give wonderful performances.  Such great work was put into this from all ends, and the result was a truly wonderful film.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that "Eternal Sunshine" is as brilliant as Kaufman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRE">Adaptation</a>, but it is more universal.  I'm partial to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRE">Adaptation</a> because, as a screenwriter myself, the way Kaufman delves into that pain and longing and frustration a writer experiences rang so true to me, whereas "Eternal Sunshine" is a film that is not really specific to anyone.  It's about love, what people mean to each other, how deeply the memories we have effect us, and even destiny.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be intrigued, and you'll certainly leave the film with the intention to see it again.  A great movie.<br /><br />9/10</p></body></html>

Indeed, as imagined by director Michael Bay in The Island, it's downright ghoulish.  Fans of sci-fi thrillers will notice many influences - The Matrix and Bladerunner are just two.  It has their visual style, brilliant art direction, and dazzling special effects.  Where it differs is the level of commitment to concept.  In Matrix and Bladerunner you have interesting philosophical puzzles examined with precision, in the Island an interesting moral puzzle is introduced and then dropped the way a child with ADD might drop a video game to spend a little while grinding marbles in the garbage disposal.<br /><br />If you've ever wondered about the ethical consequences of using stem cells, and speculated about the inevitable impact of this practice on society, this movie was supposed to be for you, but isn't.  For that matter, if you've ever thought about the difference between "important people" and "disposable people" - i.e., rich Americans vs. third world teenage kids working in slave labor conditions, meticulously crafting day-glow costumes for "Hip-Hop Barbie" - this movie could have been for you had it been written and directed by someone else.  As it stands, if you like snazzy visuals, bodacious chase scenes, and plot holes large enough for an armored car flipping end over end to pass through, sloppily wrapped in a pseudo-futuristic snack pack, this movie IS for you.<br /><br />All films are written in 3 acts; usually viewers don't notice the transitions.  Here it looks like the three acts were shot on different sets in different countries, written by different people, and directed by different people.  Act 1 is classic high sci-fi, visually convincing and intriguing.  Something is rotten in Denmark, we don't know what it is but it's cool, and we want to find out.  Act 2 is a chase scene on steroids.  Oddly, in the future some things are very different while some things haven't changed at all.  (Sadly, the Cadillac logo is the same, puzzling, since it looked old fashioned 50 years ago.)  In Act 3 many things blow up, the film even attempts a brief reconciliation with its basic premise.  Bay's chutzpah is such that he briefly reminds us of WWII death camps.  Had the film addressed its theme seriously, this might have been forgivable.<br /><br />If The Island has any enduring message at all it is this - whether we live underground in a controlled environment out of time, or above ground in a semi-futuristic kluge - one thing will always be constant - Steve Buscemi.  His brief appearance, (one assumes he was making a cameo in another mediocre movie nearby when this was being shot), is like everything else you've ever seen him do.  Even the bar he haunts and the bikers he drinks with are present day.  But, can we be sure it's him?  Is it even possible for Buscemi to be in so many movies at once?  Perhaps he was a prototype in the Echo series.  Now that is scary.</p></body></html>

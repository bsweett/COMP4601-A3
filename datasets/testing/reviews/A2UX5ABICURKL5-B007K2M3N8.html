<meta name="summary" content="Beyond what you see..."></head><body><p>At least there's someone with the guts to do a movie that's out of the norm these days.<br />The older generations ought to be happy there's people that are still taking the time to<br />make movies from that time and era in music history.<br />We don't have alot movie directors jumpin in line to make these kind of movies anymore,<br />and life is to short to worry if everything in the movie was exactly what it was like back then.<br />Just try to enjoy the movie and know Kevin Spacey did this movie cause he grew up listening to<br />Bobby Darin and he liked his style and music.<br />Me personally I thought it was a great movie, I am 39 years old didn't grow up with this kinda music,<br />but I've grown to love it.<br />I was about a year old when Bobby Darin died, but I think I would have loved his music if I had grown up<br />listening to his music as I do at age 39.<br />My rating of this movie is 5 of 5 stars, If for nothing else than effort!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Grand but grotesque, ambitious but grotesque"></head><body><p>It is not a subtle story Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone are telling in &quot;Scarface,&quot; nor is it a subtle metaphor; the saga of exiled Cuban criminal Tony Montana (Al Pacino) zooming to the top of the American capitalist structure with his drug empire, then plunging, seemingly belly flop first, into death is a beat-you-with-a-hammer version of &quot;The Godfather.&quot; <p>The ruthlessness of the film makes it particularly popular in our more ruthless times - the hip-hop nation, led by mogul P. Diddy's claim that he wishes he could watch it 24 hours a day, seems especially plugged in to whatever moral Stone and DePalma are trying to pitch, so much so, a documentary on its effect is included in the DVD package. To be fair to Stone, his scripts remained defiant and ambitious. He just directed them better.<p>Looking at it again, 20 years later, the movie has painfully dated in some ways, not in others. Pacino's performance is still foolishly over-the-top - sadly, his portrayal of the cartoonish, slurring Montana seemed to inform just about every job he's done since by getting THIS LOUD every time a minutely important moment occurs on screen, the restrained examples being &quot;Sea of Love&quot; and &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; - while the rise/fall plotline follows too direct, simplistic a line. The shades played out in the &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; and the Pacino/DePalma reteam in &quot;Carlito's Way&quot; are not there in Montana. He's straight crazy, a surviving virus finally met with himself by movie's end, only with more guns. <p>More memorable now is the performance by Mary Stuart Mastrantonio, as Tony's sister, a sweet girl pulled further into Tony's world until she is of it and able to play just a dangerous game as Tony after her lover (and Tony's partner) Manolo (Steven Bauer) is killed by Tony, ostensibly because Tony would in secret prefer his sister for himself.<br /><br />The enduring legacy of &quot;Scarface,&quot; as shown clearly in the hip-hop documentary, is that it's big, bold, violent, filled with ugly mantras (&quot;the power, the money, the women&quot;) material items, gorgeous women and hidden passions, such as incest, that only within the reach of a true showstopper psycho like Tony. Though Montana dies, Pacino packs so much bravado in his death that even that moment is glorified as a fitting end - that to have it all, lose it all, die and do it with a strut is the key to a short, happy life. The more recent &quot;Blow&quot; isn't nearly as exciting, but its lines aren't blurred; &quot;Scarface,&quot; intentionally, I think, cheerfully endorsed Tony in 1983, and still does. It's entertainment, extremely well-filmed entertainment, but ugly, and at its core, rotten. It's admirable and loathsome in equal portions.</p></body></html>

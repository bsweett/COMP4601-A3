Yeah, it's rude, vulgar, uses the F word as both a noun and a verb and it has a sex scene that made me cringe and change the channel for a few mintues but it's also funny. The  songs, especially Montage, America .. Yeah, and I'm So Ronery were brilliant. The mockery of our smug, self important little celebrites  and political correctness was great and the scene where the team destroys half of Egypt, with the best of intentions was a gut buster.<br /><br />So it's not up there with "On the Waterfront" but neither is anything else in the theaters today. Team America may be mindless but it sure is fun. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go sing America... Yeah for the 50th time.</p></body></html>

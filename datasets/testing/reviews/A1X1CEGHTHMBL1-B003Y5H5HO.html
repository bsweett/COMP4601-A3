They suddenly find themselves involved in the search for a serial killer whose murders span more than 40 years...<br /><br />I had real reservations watching an American made version of this movie.  My wife and I had watched the original movie and we both liked it a lot.  I thought this would just be a remake and I would not enjoy it a second time.  I was wrong! There are some changes to the movie but it substantially follows the original closely. The acting is superb and Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig are just marvelous in this movie.  If you like the original then you will love this one also.<br /><br />Just be aware that there is graphic violence and gruesome murder photos in the movie as well as sex and rape. If this is not your type of movie then be warned.<br /><br />This movie is every bit as good as the original and they are both 5 Star movies!</p></body></html>

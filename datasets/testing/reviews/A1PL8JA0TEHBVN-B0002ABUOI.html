<meta name="summary" content="THEY REMADE A CLASSIC.... AND MADE ANOTHER CLASSIC!!!!!"></head><body><p>First... you should know there are four versions of this film available. They are:<br /><br /> Widescreen<br /><br /> Fullscreen<br /><br /> Director's Cut Widescreen<br /><br /> Director's Cut Fullscreen<br /><br /> Well... as a longtime zombie fan, I must say that I felt worried when I heard they were going to ramake one of the best horror films ever made. But after reading about it and watching it, I understood this film was NOT a basic, simple remake... it was a &quot;reenvisionment&quot;.<br /><br /> They took the original premisse and worked a new movie into it. ...Simple as that. In this way, I think no &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; fan should feel angry about &quot;new guys touching the classic film&quot;.<br /><br /> This NEW &quot;DOTD&quot; is a completely new film with all the budget, effects and ideas the 21st century can afford (today, this film can do many things it was not allowed 25 years ago!). Like me, the real fans will still feel confortable enough with some references the screenwriter threw in just for our amusement (can you spot them all??).<br /><br /> The premisse is known... It appears that America is turned overnight by a plague os zombies... we see it happens (in one of the best horror film opennings ever made!!!) almost step by step until a group of people barricade themselves inside a shopping mall.<br /><br /> Having said this, I have to admit I cannot choose between the two films (as many people will try to do) because they are so different in so many ways........ anyway... I do believe the simple existence of this &quot;remake&quot; is a great homage to the original film which stays at the cathedral it belongs. Thus, this new version will surelly attract a whole new legion of fans who did not see the original. In fact, it will bring a new (comercial) life to the original - as the Anchor Bay new dvd proves it.<br /><br /> Now, about the film....<br /><br /> I like it very much. To me, it is better than RESIDENT EVIL (which I liked very much) and better than 28 DAYS LATER (whose 30 last minutes I hated). Mr. Snyder seems to have a strong eye and a great sense of composition. His directing seems firm and sure. Many people may not know, but hes comes from advertising films and I sure noticed his strong sense of pacing.<br /><br /> I was also afraid this film would have an &quot;all-too-beautiful&quot; advertising look. Well, it doesn't. It looks real and well situated.<br /><br /> The casting seemed also like a good choice. While there are so much more characters than the original film, the chemistry between them, the plots and their backstories are nicely interlaced. I really liked these characters.<br /><br /> The major plot news is the fact that this film gives a lot of attention to the sense of confusion the characters go into as they witness the &quot;dawn of the dead&quot;... and its massive impact on society - in this sense, the first 20 minutes of this film are some of the best horror-film setups I have ever seen. Yes, it has lots of scarry moments and you should enjoy every one of them!!<br /><br /> Need I say the makeup is over-the-top studio quality?<br /><br /> Anyway, I think this film is a terrific horror film. It is fun, scarry, fast, loud... all in the right portions. It should be seen without prejudice. Obviously, the film has a few details I did not like (which I don't think I should discuss here... ok, I will... I thought the baby zombie was dull!!!), but I still think this to be a winning project. I hope it film is a huge success and I hope finally Mr.Romero is given the green light to his project.<br /><br /> The director's cut does not add too much to the film. The changes I noticed are very discreet... a few more short scenes. I recomend it simply bacause in the case of a good film such as this, why not stay with it 10 more minutes?<br /><br /> More extras?<br /><br /> I loved the news covering the zombie outbreak. They DO look real enough to make you wonder. The documentaries on makeup and f/x are also fine. In short, this is an exemple of good extras and the right way to make a DVD.<br /><br /> Al last, zombies are fully into mainstream Cinema!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thank God for the Federal Government!..."></head><body><p>...that is the message from this rather illogical but fast-moving film. Poor old (wrongly convicted) Dr. Richard Kimble escapes from State Prison, and through some inexplicable legal quirk, the Federal Government takes jurisdiction for capturing him. Good thing too, since (according to this film) all state cops and other State and Local authorities are venal idiots, and the Feds, by contrast, are hyper-competent and masterful Law Enforcement Professionals (capital letters). I love the scene where Tommy Lee Jones (a Federal Marshal, no less) almost captures Kimble (Harrison Ford)... Get Down On Your Knees Richard, if you don't want to get shot!... (you can almost hear him think: "this is the proper position for ANYONE when in the presence of the all-mighty Federal Government..." By the way, fugitive Richard Kimble has not committed the ultimate crime of criticizing an incumbent politician within 30 days of an election in violation of McCain-Feingold. No, he is (wrongly) convicted of murdering his wife.<br /><br />When referring to a large drug company, Tommy Lee Jones (embodying the Federal Government) remarks "that company does nine billion dollars in sales a year... it is a monster" ... you can almost hear him say "...the kind of monster that Bill and Hillary have been fighting all their lives."<br /><br />Despite the heavy-handed portrayal as the Federal Government as the rightful Master of Us All, this is a fast-paced action film that holds the viewer's interest. Harrison Ford is as appealing as always, and Tommy Lee Jones shows us that we don't really need laws or judges to restrain the Federal Government, because it has contempt for these things anyway. After all, as Jones points out, he wants wiretaps on everyone, including Kimball's lawyer, and he will justify this later, "if I'm in a good mood." Hey, who needs the Constitution?<br /><br />Yes, I admit it, I've got an attitude about this film. I still enjoyed it though. Go figure.</p></body></html>

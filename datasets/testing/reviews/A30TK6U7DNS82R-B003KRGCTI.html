It's worth seeing if only for that good post-mortem that sends you to the diner arguing over french fries about the real meaning of the scene between Denzel Washington and Jennifer Beals.<br /><br />Otherwise, the film is ridiculously bleak and heavyhanded.  Tumbleweeds, check.  Sepia tones throughout, check.  Cannibals, check.  It is a patchwork of familiar elements that you have seen done better in a hundred other movies.  In one scene, Denzel is held captive in a cell-like room decorated only by a tattered poster from a long-ago 70s apocalypse film, Don Johnson in A Boy and His Dog--itself so much better than The Book of Eli it seemed almost as if the movie was taunting itself!  But instead it was probably intended as a homage...  Much of the movie was one homage stitched onto another...  When Mila Kunis made the sign of the cross to a leering Gary Oldman, it was so much like Bram Stoker's Dracula it was crazy!  And what about the old, decrepit desert house occupied by the two seniors, who call themselves George and Martha?  Their names recall the central couple in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but why?<br /><br />Denzel, Gary Oldman, most of the actors were good, but against all odds.  The things they had to say and act out were ludicrous.  Defeated, perhaps by her character arc, perhaps by her own limitations, was poor Mila Kunis.  I thought Kylie Minogue, much as I love her, a bad actress, but Mila Kunis makes Kylie seem like Dame Judi Dench in comparison.  And yet, I wound up liking her just the same, especially when I read the interview with her that said in preparation for playing "Solara" opposite Denzel Washington, she had tried to read the Bible.  "Which part?"  "The first part.  Genesis.  But I just couldn't finish it.  It was good but it was boring."  Now, that's what my dad used to call "stick to it-ive-ness."</p></body></html>

Time and time again, I have looked at the overall ratings of movies, and 99% percent of the time, the overall ratings are right on with what I consider great movies!!<br /><br />The Jacket is no exception...for a while I was afraid to watch this movie, thinking it was going to be all blood and guts and gore...wrong!! This movie is very interesting, and the actors do a wonderful job with the material. It is said that in order to prepare for the straight jacket and enclosed box scenes, Brody actually had the director put him in box, to feel the mood, and did he ever!! Those freak out scenes that you see...are real!!<br /><br />Great direction, great story...Great everything!!! Do not miss this movie!! Thriller City!!</p></body></html>

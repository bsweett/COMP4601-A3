<meta name="summary" content="Incredible film and amazingly timely as well"></head><body><p>V for Vendetta will not be a film that everyone will see. It is, however, a film that everyone SHOULD see.<br /><br />If this film didn't have source material that it is fairly faithful to, I'd say that the filmmakers wrote the script based on events of the last five years. That's how timely it is.<br /><br />Known to the public as a terrorist, V, is a man who dons a Guy Fawkes mask and costume and attempts to bring about a revolution in a near-future England. Along the way he befriends a young woman - Evey (Natalie Portman) - who inadvertantly becomes his friend.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is a very British film and that is a good thing. The cast is very British and very well schooled in their craft as character actors. As a result, the film is exciting, clean, crisp, and invigorating when it should be and dramatic and engaging when it should be.<br /><br />The script is tight and well written. The content....well, it's amazing how timely it truly is.<br /><br />V is the ultimate anti-hero. Sure, he is acting outside the law and performing acts that would constitute terrorism, but we must remember that the U.S. was founded on similar acts: the Boston Tea Party, the Revolutionary War, etc.<br /><br />This film is about change and how it is necessary for people to take their blinders off and see what is wrong in the world and actively participate in making the change come about.<br /><br />Amazing film!</p></body></html>

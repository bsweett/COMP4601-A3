<meta name="summary" content="Liam Neeson elevates what could have been pedestrian revenge flick"></head><body><p>Liam Neeson shares a trait that all great actors possess - they can do something completely ridiculous and remain entirely believable.  If you're watching Patrick Stewart play Jean-Luc Picard on "Star Trek - Next Generation," you're watching an actual Star Fleet captain rather than a ham actor over-acting on a cheesy set.  If you're watching Sigourney Weaver in "Alien," you're watching Ripley take on the universe's most dangerous monster rather than an actress dancing with a rubber suit.  If you're watching Meryl Streep in "The Devil Wears Prada," you're watching an egotistical editor of a fashion magazine, not a drama queen emoting for effect.<br /><br />From "Darkman" to "Star Wars" to "Taken," Neeson has always remained believable and compelling no matter how ridiculous his surroundings or god-awful the dialogue.<br /><br />In "Taken," we have to believe that Bryan Mills (Neeson) is a lethal espionage/security guy, one of the best in the world, whose dedication to the job cost him his family.  Too late, he realized his error and quit so he can live in unemployed drudgery and snatch a few moments here and there with his cherished daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace).  Bryan's ex, Lenore (Famke Jannsen, in a thankless role), has custody of Kim and has remarried a sugar daddy who is actually a better person than Lenore.  Kim desperately pleads with Bryan to let her go to Paris with her friend Amanda to tour museums.  Bryan reluctantly consents, going against his better instincts that his 17-year old baby is going to a dangerous place and is not ready for it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Bryan is right - within minutes of landing in Paris, things go horribly, horribly wrong.  If you saw the trailer for "Taken," you know that the movie is about Bryan's hunt for Kim across the Parisian underworld.<br /><br />This is where "Taken" takes flight in a "Bourne Ultimatum" kind of way.  There is virtually no character development - the question is whose arm Bryan will break (or worse) as he hunts for his daughter, and how efficiently he'll do it.  Like Jason Bourne, Bryan Mills is not an acrobatic martial artist who will jump, twirl, and kick for dramatic effect - he'll rip your ears off and snap your legs with economic fury.  He's not doing it to be cool.  He's doing what he needs to do to get his daughter back.<br /><br />Woe betide any man or woman who gets in his way.  "Taken" strings together a preposterous chain of events that could never happen in a gazillion years, but you won't have time to figure that out until after the movie is over.  For 90-odd minutes, you'll be taken on a compelling thrill ride, courtesy of Neeson and team.<br /><br />Full disclosure - while this movie owes an obvious debt to the "Bourne" franchise as far as the feel and look of the film is concerned, it is considerably darker in both subject matter and tone.  This is far from a feel-good movie - you get the sense there are no winners here.</p></body></html>

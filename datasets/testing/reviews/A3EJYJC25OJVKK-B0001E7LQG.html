<meta name="summary" content="I was skeptical but I actually loved this movie."></head><body><p>I for one am very biased against romantic comedies. A vast majority of them are extremely predictable and go nowhere for me. While some of that does apply to &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot;, however the main characters however though give this film a more original twist. <p> Harry Sanborn is a 60 year old bachelor who never dates women over 30 years old and has fallen in love with another one...again except by this point he realizes he has been finding himself being attracted to someone who is in his age group (50+ years of ago) and this has started to make him think about his polygamous ways plus heart problems have plagued him. <p> He starts to realize that the older woman, a Playwright worker and he share a lot in common and Harry realizes that he has a choice to make. <p> This movie while stymied by some predictable elements, is a really smartly done movie in a lot of ways. No pun indended at all but many movies of this genre are focused on younger couples and this extremely formulaic pattern really ruins many movies in this category but SGG however steers clear of that by focusing on older characters. <p> In some ways this film was bothersome but it was because it reminded me of someone one of my relatives dated years ago before things went sour. <p> This is a great movie worth checking out.</p></body></html>

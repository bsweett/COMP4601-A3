The film just looks different from other films with its dark geometric interiors and camera shots that actually accentuate all the interior settings. It also is a unique story for it famously follows the life of William Randolph Hearst and is a commentary on that oversized powerhouse ego-maniac. The two female leads in the film, Ruth Warrick, playing first wife Emily Monroe Norton Kane, and Dorothy Comingore, playing second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, were extremely strong performances that were as different from each other as night and day. For Kane is one of those people who do not think the normal consequences of life apply to him. When he runs for public office while attacking his political opponent, he never seems to realize that the fact that he has a mistress will come to light and destroy his marriage and his political career. Kane relentlessly attacks career politician James Gettys, played by Ray Collins. But Gettys is a seasoned street fighter. He gets the goods on Kane and then carefully confronts him in a set up situation where both women are involved. Emily Kane shows tremendous grace in the face of defeat and humiliation. But then a life of hell starts for Susan Alexander Kane for she becomes the project of her husband who pushes her to sing and become an opera star. Susan Kane's speaking voice can peel paint off walls, a penetrating and grating high volume whine. When she and Charles Kane escape to his castle, the film becomes surreal, something out of Camus or Sartre, where people become each other's hell. Susan Kane's fall into alcoholism is tragic and yet totally expected. Joseph Cotton plays Jebediah Leland, Kane's best friend who sinks into alcoholism and obscurity in the shadow of his overpowering friend. Agnes Moorehead plays Mary Kane, the poor puritanical mother who gives up her son so that he might develop the sophistication to enjoy his wealth. I found the film to be very unique, highly entertaining and visually interesting.</p></body></html>

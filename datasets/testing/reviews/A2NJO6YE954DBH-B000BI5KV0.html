<meta name="summary" content=""In the harshest place on Earth, love finds a way""></head><body><p>First of all, nobody needs Opus, the current Coca-Cola commercials or the trailer for next year's "Happy Feet" to know that penguins are cute.  We learned that lesson in the movies when Dick Van Dyke danced with animated penguin waiters in "Mary Poppins," and everybody who has seen penguins in person knows they are about as cute as animals get.  So a documentary that shows us hundreds of penguins for eighty-minutes is going to be captivating because that is a lot of cinematic cuteness.  But there is more.<br /><br />Second, "March of the Penguins" ("La Marche de l'empereur," literally "The Emperor's Journey") is about the mating habits of the Emperor Penguins, the biggest penguins of them all.  Now, what you need to know is that when this film is over you are going to be able to pass a quiz on that particular subject.  The combination of director Luc Jacquet's footage from the Antarctic and the narration by Morgan Freeman is such that when this is over you will know how far the male penguins march, how long they go without food, how they receive the eggs from the females, how much weight they lose, and just about anything else that a teacher might want to put on a quiz.  I know documentaries are supposed to be informative but rarely have I felt like I had really learned something.  I mean, just because we are supposed to learn something does not mean that we will, but in this case I think most viewers will clearly learn a lesson.<br /><br />Third, although Jacquet is dealing with the harsh realities of these penguins, who are trying to breed on what is literally the harshest place on Earth, he focuses much more on the miracle of life.  There is a point where you think the camera is about to show us things we really do not want to see, much as they are part of the circle of life and all that, but things never get that far.  I was worried about what young children would think when some of the natural predators of the Emperors show up, but I do not think there is anything here that would be traumatic even though there are certainly some heartbreaking scenes, which is to be expected when cute things die.<br /><br />Fourth, Freeman is the only narrator for this film, which is obvious when you watch "March of the Penguins."  But it seems that in places like France and Japan the film was shown with a trio of narrators representing the father penguin (Manchot p&egrave;re/Haha-Penguin), the mother penguin (Manchot m&egrave;re/Ko-Penguiin), and baby penguin (Manchot b&eacute;b&eacute;/Chichi-Penguin).  Learning this makes me wonder if just having Morgan provide the solemn narration strengthens the film's educational value.  Having the voices for the three members of the family might be adding cute on top of cute, which does not always work.<br /><br />Fifth, any doubts about the rating for this DVD are erased by the extras.  "Of Penguins and Men" is a documentary about the making of the documentary, which actually provides a few additional insights into the Emperors.  The National Geographic's "Crittercam: Emperor Penguins" provides a fascinating look at how penguins feed on fish when they dive beneath the ice, which proves to be essentially the same strategy as used by eagles and hawks.  Then for good measure there is "8 Ball Bunny," a classic WB cartoon where Bugs Bunny makes the mistake of promising to take a little lost penguin home (this is the one has a running gag regarding Humphrey Bogart's character in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre"), and the theatrical trailer for "March of the Penguins."  In short, the extras are about as long as the documentary itself, which makes for a nice balance without putting kids and parents on information overload.</p></body></html>

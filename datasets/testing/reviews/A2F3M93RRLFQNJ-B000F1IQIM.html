<meta name="summary" content="Once upon a sequel"></head><body><p>Once Upon a Time in Mexico - the sequel to Desperado - is a tale of Antonio Banderas as a superheroic gunman battling outlaws in the modern west.  As indicated by the title, this is a bit of an homage to Sergio Leone's films, and this story does have a good, a bad and an ugly.  The good is Banderas's gunman, a vengeance-driven guitar player who is called on to forsake his vows of non-violence.  The bad is Willem Defoe's drug lord, who has financed a coup d'etat which will be led by a general who had also killed Banderas's wife and daughter.  The ugly - and easily the most entertaining character - is Johnny Depp's amusingly sociopathic CIA agent who will kill with little cause but also has his human side.<p>Although lightly entertaining, this is not a great movie.  There are far too many characters and the plot is needlessly complex.  Banderas is supposed to be the hero, but he isn't very interesting; he's just a shooting machine.  Since the deaths of his family have occurred before the start of the movie, they don't really have much emotional impact and therefore it is hard to empathize with his vengeance motive.  Depp, on the other hand, is interesting; with his strange craving for balance in the universe, he evens the odds in many situations, but his intricate manipulations eventually get too much even for him to handle.  Selma Hayek - despite her prominence in the ads - is actually only in the movie only briefly.<p>I can't exactly give this movie a rave review, but it is passably fun and won't be a waste of your time.  On the other hand, if you never see it, your life will not be incomplete.</p></body></html>

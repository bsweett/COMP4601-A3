<meta name="summary" content="The remake to John Carpenter's 1980 The Fog, is a epic of foggyed up porportions"></head><body><p>Like all remakes I am very skeptical of what they do, be it Texas Chainsaw Massarce, the first one was alright but the remake...well the two remakes were total awful. This year, there were a bunch of remakes like War Of The Worlds, The Longest Yard, Bad News Bears, and The Amityville Horror and so on....I dont know, I like to complain some times a lot on remakes because sometimes they do horrible jobs and sometimes they do a decent job and some surprise me. The remake of John Carpenter's 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis flick, The Fog is not that successful. I like the fog effect when the fog rolls into the town, they did a good job at that. The story consists of a town called Antonio Bay and a curse from a ship wreck which involving the towns Four Fathers. The crew from the ship are ghosts and they bring the fog along with them. A failed attempt, too bad John Carpenter didnt remake it, that would of been interesting but Rupert Wainwright's directing only goes so far and the ghosts are only effective when we cant see them up close, only when we see them from afar and walking. Starring Tom Welling (Cheaper By The Dozen movies, Tv's Smallville), Maggie Grace (Tv's LOST), Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions, Hellboy), Rade Sherbedgia (Eyes Wide Shut, Snatch) in a wasted role, Kenneth Walsh and DeRay Davis. Some pretty interesting moments direction wise, Grace and Welling cant save it, neither can Selma Blair who gets nothing out of this.</p></body></html>

Some, like Nolan's Batman movies are deadly serious epics about ethics, corruption, organized crime, etc...  Others, like the Spider-Man franchise with Tobey Maguire, and the Batman movies of Tim Burton, incorporate some humor via dialog and action.  Then there those like Iron Man where the main character itself provides the comedy by trying to be funny in the movie.  But never has there been an absolutely outrageous and hilarious comic-book movie like Kick-Ass.  From start to finish this movie is loaded with laughs of all sorts.  From slapstick action scenes to sarcastic dialog to ludicrous outfits, all accompanied by fast-paced music, this is the funniest comic book movie I have ever seen, and one of the funniest movies released in 2010.  But don't take your children to watch it.  This movie earned its "R" rating on many counts.  With bad language, some nudity, and a lot of bloody violence, this movie, which features more children than most movies, is certainly adults only.<br /><br />For those wanting to know what this movie resembles, I would answer "Kill Bill".  Both Kill Bill and Kick-Ass are titled after a male character in the movie, even though the principle character in both movies is female.  In the latter case, it is a pre-teenage girl.  In both Kill Bill and Kick-Ass, it is the female character that has the most action scenes, and the most kills.  And in both movies, most of the main characters have nicknames.  Other common threads are the excessive violence, large body count, gritty action, iconic musical score comprised of pop hits, and the theme of revenge flowing throughout.  Kick-Ass came in the same general time frame as other comedy movies about average people trying to become superheroes, movies such as Super and Defendor.  A sequel is in the works, so it looks like we have a new genre of not-so-superhero movies coming to Hollywood.  Overall, a great movie; and my vote for best comic-book movie of 2010.</p></body></html>

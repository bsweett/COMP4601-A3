<meta name="summary" content="Still holds up"></head><body><p>Please note that this is on the movie which I saw on HBO a few days ago, not on the DVD transfer, so I can't speak to the quality of that.<br /><br />I would like to make a few comments on the video and animation, though. I just saw the movie again for the first time since it came out, and I have to say it still holds up very well from the standpoint of the special effects and animation. Certainly, the CGI effects are better today, but for the time this was state of the art.<br /><br />The dinosaurs are realistically rendered, and movement is very fluid and realistic also. One difference between then and now is that high level optical effects still weren't very highly developed, such as the ability to render certain kinds of reflections, such as those involving chromatic aberration and specular highlights, and the ray-tracing programs were not as technically capable. But overall this is still an impressive movie from the standpoint of the special effects.<br /><br />The dinosaurs were seamlessly inserted into the Jurassic backgrounds with the humans, and the movie benefited from the revolution in dinosaur theory that began back in the 70s with the new ideas about dinosaurs being much more agile and faster and possibly even warm blooded. The paleontologist, played by Sam Neill, even suggests that they had the ability to communicate through calls like birds and mammals. Today, it is thought that mammals like foxes, not just primates, have as many as 50 distinct calls.<br /><br />As to the other things like the acting, it was fine but let's face it, the dinosaurs were the real stars here and I think they upstaged the more advanced mammals in the flick, and my vote goes to them for their performance. :-)  But I have always liked actor Sam Neill and this might be his most famous role as the enthusiastic and intrepid dinosaur expert. And Mr. Attenborough is always good in whatever he does.<br /><br />Overall still a great adventure classic that still holds up well today.<br /><br />By the way, if you like animated flicks, I have to put in a plug here for the movie, "The Battle for Terra." It's an independently produced fully animated movie that didn't receive wide distribution, since it was done by Hollywood outsiders. But it's a beautiful and visually appealing movie about a war between a peaceful race and warlike humans who attack their planet. If you compare it with say, "Titan A.E." from almost ten years ago, you can see how much the animation technology has changed in that time. "Titan A.E.," although great for its time, looked more like an animated cartoon. This movie looks like they're shooting actual 3D models, the figures and sets are so realistic and lifelike. It's a totally different world, literally.<br /><br />Even technically difficult lighting effects such as simple and complex reflection and refraction such as specular highlights are rendered realistically, which many world-class painters have trouble rendering (Vermeer and van Eyck are two of the greats who could do this well). As if this wasn't enough, at the very end of the movie, amazingly, some erudite visual jokester inserted chromatic distortions that look like the internal reflections typical of compound optical lenses, which various high-tech optical coatings are designed to minimize, as if the movie was shot with a real film camera. Too funny.<br /><br />So if you're into CGI stuff I can recommend this movie also.</p></body></html>

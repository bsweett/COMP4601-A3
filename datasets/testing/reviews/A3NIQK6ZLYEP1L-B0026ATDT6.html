<meta name="summary" content="It is a family movie..."></head><body><p>No, really, this is a drama about a family coming back together.  The monster, who is the title of the film, is the mover of the plot only in that it kidnaps the girl.  The father, and the rest of the family, spend the rest of the film trying to find her and save her.  Even the governments involved focus more on the virus the monster has than the monster itself.  In the end it seems like they're not even worried about killing it.  The cast is great and I plan to try to find more movies based on the stars and the directors.  In fact, I only do have a few.  The extras are fun, very interesting and go on forever!  Love the humor and the behind the scenes features.</p></body></html>

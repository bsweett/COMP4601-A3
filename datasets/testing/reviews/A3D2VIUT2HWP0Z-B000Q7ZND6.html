<meta name="summary" content="Awesome Adventure"></head><body><p>SINGLE DISC DVD:(19 july 2005) The Film is awesome.Sound is great, and the film is a superb watch. Extras are at a minimum on the single disc version. I plan to get the double disc version ASAP. But being able to watch again the superb sequences in this horror film is great. Some people define horror as "Slash/gore/hack" etc, but a series of great supernatural elements are worked out in this film. The layers in the film are manifold, and they repay additional watching.<br />I still find the book that came out to be the best explanation of the background in the film.<br />The criticism of the film as a "Bad  Adaptation" of the comic is just silly ... this is a film, the comic is the comic.<br />The characters are defined very well. Both "John" and the detective are world weary characters who are trying to resolve issues in their lives.<br />The best element on the supernatural side is the detail... its damn near perfect. Hopefully the two disc  version will have some extra  cool stuff as well.<br /><br />*************************************<br /><br />I have been waiting for this film ever since I saw the first trailers in 2004. And I was definitely NOT  disappointed.<br />It is an absolutely great rollercoaster ride, and all the edgy bits just flow together superbly, and Keanu proves once again he can deliver the goods.<br />The film works  brilliantly script wise, and brings in many supernatural ideas, that are articulated well thanks to great FX. Rachel Weisz is definitely a great choice for the role she fulfills.<br />As a literally  World weary specialist in the occult, Keanu takes us through a journey to hell and back.<br />For myself, I found this  film to be more visceral than cerebral, in a very positive way. If you really need some explanation of what has happened, I can highly recommend the book tie-in, but read AFTER you see the movie. You will not be disappointed.</p></body></html>

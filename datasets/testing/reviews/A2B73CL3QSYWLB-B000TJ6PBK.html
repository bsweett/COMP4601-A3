<meta name="summary" content="Tasty Offering From Stephen King"></head><body><p>"1408" aspires to be a latter day "The Shining".  It doesn't reach the level that Stanley Kubrick did but it offers enough chills for the buck.  Where Kubrick utilized a snowbound resort hotel to ratchet dread and claustrophobia, here a mundane hotel room serves the same purpose.  There is a certain supernatural element to the room's objects but the biggest boogeyman in the room is the human psyche.  It was a stroke of genius to cast John Cusack as the room's intended victim.  Cusack is an understated actor who rarely gives in to histrionics.  If Cusack can go bonkers than something truly evil is afoot.  Not classic King but more than passable Halloween fare.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Independence Day  (1996)"></head><body><p>Director:  Roland Emmerich<br />Cast:  Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, Harvey Fierstein.<br />Running Time:  145 minutes.<br />Rated PG-13 for some violence, a particularly scary alien scene, and brief language.<p>A quintessential example of the "summer blockbuster", "Independence Day" is a full-filled science-fiction epic with a likable cast, astonishing special effects, and a unique style of direction from Roland Emmerich.  It is a film that emphasizes the American dream, patriotism, and perhaps is a stab at communism, in which the war against the all-mighty alien terror is actually symbolizing the decades of struggle that the United States dealt with against socialist countries such as Nazi Germany and the U.S.S.R.<p>Will Smith is excellent as a rogue fighter pilot who finds himself preparing for an unusual enemy--a species of extra-terrestrials that first hovered over the planet Earth, but then struck mightily with beams of destructive fire that ripped apart all of the world's major cities.  Bill Pullman gives an adequate role as the gung ho president who must trust his heart and not let political issues determine the fate of the world as he knows it.  Jeff Goldblum play his usual scientist role, but is wittier than usual and is a grand compliment to the Fresh Prince.  The three main stars engage in an all-out battle against the aliens, eventually coming face to face with the mothership and its inhabitants.<p>"ID4" is certainly not an emotional film, but more of a visual effects spectacle that show-boats the arriving technology at the time.  Director Roland Emmerich basically states "screw your cool-looking dinosaurs Spielberg, check this out!" and lets loose with a barrage of intense explosions and catastrophe, making the first half of the film similar to that of an old 1970's national disaster flick.  The second half of "Independence Day" is truly enjoyable as the audience gets to konw the characters better and they are intertwined in a battle for mankind.  Cheesy, outlandish, and sometimes down-right stupid; however, it not taken too seroiusly, "ID4" is a rock-em, sock-em adventure that will delight the whole family.  Still probably has the coolest looking spaceship ever created on film--it is amazing!</p></body></html>

Now I'm not saying this isn't good or unwatchable, but I am saying the director threw way too many ideas at it, and couldn't edit it good enough.<br /><br />My main problem always has been with the Spiderman movies Tobey Maguire. He's got the face of a little boy sometimes, and the hands of an old man. In my mind, he just doesn't fit as Spiderman/Peter Parker. Yes, he's a geek, but at some points, he's too geeky to BE Spiderman. Clark Kent was a hot geek. Tobey Maguire not so much.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 has a lot of special effects, some of the best being the effects creating Sandman, played by Thomas Hayden Church, who is connected to the first movie in some way (whatever could that be?), and throughout the film he is a bad guy. But watch out for the ending he actually turns out good. I wasn't too keen on the bad-guy-with-no-name, who later turns out to be called Venom. It seemed a little too contrived that the black goo just happened to fall on him and create another bad guy. I'm sure this worked out better in the comics but a bit more explanation on screen would be better.<br /><br />However, the movie does have its hilarious moments. The scenes with Bruce Campbell as the Ma?tre d', who fails miserably to do his part in the proposal, with a hilarious moustache. Then there's J.K. Simmons, who plays Peter's boss. He was funny in the first two films, but he comes into his own in this, and practically steals the show in every scene. Especially with the long running joke about his high blood pressure, his temper, and how many tablets he has to take. Definitely a scene I will be re-watching over & over when I get the DVD. "Not that one!"<br /><br />I honestly did not see the point in Bryce Dallas Howard though. OK, bring a new love interest in, but some dumb blonde against Mary Jane? Not gonna work. Apart from evoking the green eyed monster in Mary Jane, there's not really much point in her being in the film. And she's underused to boot.<br /><br />I was forewarned that I would be cringing at one point during the film, and I thought "What could possibly make me cringe in a Spiderman movie?" How wrong was I?! I had my head in my hands, and not only was it a pointless scene, it felt like a very bad parody of Saturday Night Fever. Very bad parody. Accompanied by corny music, Peter Parker thinking he's turned into God's gift to women, complete with groin thrusting, must have been embarrassing for Tobey to film, but I hope it doesn't go to his head. Honestly. It's not an image I will ever get out of my head. I have to admit though, I did think he looked hot with the black suit/black shirt outfit. If his head suddenly disappeared inside the shirt of course.<br /><br />I did think James Franco deserved a bigger role in this film, especially with what happens. The whole goblin grenade to the face was just an insult, and then conveniently getting amnesia. Not good. He is turning into one of my favourite actors, and he is a bit of a good looking guy. But who's gonna be Peter's buddy now? Believe me, if you've got a heart of stone, you will shed a tear.<br /><br />I'm still not sure this was a good sequel to the Spiderman movies, and I have this baaaaddddd feeling they're going to continue the series, but Kirsten and Tobey have all said they really want to move on now. Hey maybe they'd bring in Jake Gyllenhaal instead! That would make it good. But they seemed to focus a lot of Mary Jane's jealousy and the cool special effects. Can't they just let them be happy?</p></body></html>

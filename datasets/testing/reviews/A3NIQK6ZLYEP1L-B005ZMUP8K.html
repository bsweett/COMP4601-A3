Even his outfit is realistic when compared to other pirate movies.  After having said that I have to point out that all the special effects and pirate humor in the world can't save a weak plot.  It WAS written on the spot, the many special features dealing with how the movie was made tells us that!<br />They took from everybody.  The black spot is from Treasure Island, the cannibals from the Muppet's version of Treasure Island, the hanging cages from Time Bandits and, YES, even the title for the film comes from the SEQUEL to the book Treasure Island.  Also, I have a few nitpicks.  First off, Davy Jones was never captain of the Flying Dutchmen.  Also, why was the East India Company in the Caribbean?<br />I know this is the first movie of a two part movie deal but that is no defense.  The Empire Strikes Back and The Two Towers were, alone, great movies and they were part of a larger series.  Why were they so good?  The great stories they started out with.<br />But, as I have already pointed out, Dead Men's Chest is nothing but scenes and gags glued together, made to hold us in our seats till the third movie came out.  And I haven't seen the third movie so I am NOT impressed by this one.</p></body></html>

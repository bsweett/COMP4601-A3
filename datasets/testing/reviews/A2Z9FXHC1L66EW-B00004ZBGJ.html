All 5 films plus a bonus documentary hosted by the late great Roddy McDowall, Behind The Planet Of The Apes is a 126 minute  making of which shows the origins and the ideas that lead to the filming of  the saga which began in 1967, thru the rest of the films 'til 1973 as well  as the two television series (live action and animated) and the rereleasing  of the films and marketing.  But you have to buy this set soon because  after the first 100,000 are sold, the next sets will not, I repeat, will  not include the Behind The Planet Of The Apes documentary, which, to me, is  the best special feature you get with these movies.  The lowdown on the  films is this:  Planet Of The Apes is a classic.  Trust me, if you don't  like this one you won't like the rest.  The ending is historic.  Beneath  The Planet Of The Apes is a good second effort.  I just wish Charlton  Heston would've starred in the entire picture instead of the beginning and  ending. (note: the trailer for this film is different from the one given on  the VHS version (you can still see parts of that one on the documentary)).  Escape From The Planet Of The Apes is a very original installment which  takes place in the past circa 1973.  This one is lighter and more fun up  until the end.  Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes is the most underated of  all the Apes films.  This is the only ape film that recieved a PG rating  for violence and deservedly so, but what makes this one unique is Roddy  McDowell's understated performance as Ceaser, the ape who would lead his  brothers and sisters to victory over the humans who have enslaved them.  This is the darkest of the set and, to me, deserves better recognition.  Battle For The Planet Of The Apes is a decent 5th installment.  This film  was made primarily for the kiddies, so, bearing that in mind you should  know what to expect and even so, this film is still quite entertaining.  None of these films were a boxoffice failure.  They all made money. So go  ape and grab this set, which includes the trailers for all 5 films, a photo  gallery for the first 2 films and of course, the documentary, Behind The  Planet Of The Apes.  Don't dawdle, grab this set soon.  You don't want to  give up the documentary.  It's a perfect companion to the rest of the films  that gives you some great insight and will be highly collectable in the  near future.</p></body></html>

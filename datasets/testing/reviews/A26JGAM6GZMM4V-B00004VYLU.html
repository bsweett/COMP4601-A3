<meta name="summary" content="Fabric, Texture, and Nuance of Cinematic Genius"></head><body><p>This film is based on a book written by Nicholas Pileggi (Wiseguy) as was Casino based on another of his books (Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas). Both were directed by Scorcese and two of the major characters in both films are portrayed by DeNiro ("Ace" Rothstein and Jimmy Conway) and Joe Pesci (Nicky Santoro and Tommy DeVito). For me, these are the only significant similarities between the two film classics. True, Scorcese effectively employs a number of documentary techniques in both (especially during the first half of Casino) but the setting of GoodFellas is essentially a neighborhood whereas Casino examines the gambling culture of Las Vegas, represented by the Tangiers which is owned by syndicate bosses headquartered elsewhere. Moreover, the character Henry Hill (portrayed as an adult by Ray Liotta) is used as a device by which to explain rites of passage into the local crime world whereas the focal point of Casino is Rothstein as he becomes (in effect) the COO of a major casino and quickly establishes total local control of its operations, then (for various reasons) makes personal decisions which eventually place him and his absentee bosses in harm's way. One of the several reasons I admire Scorcese so much is his talent (indeed genius) for creating so-called "minor" but nonetheless memorable, indeed unforgettable characters. For example, Paul Cicero (portrayed by Paul Sorvino) in this film, a character which may have had some influence on the creation of another character, Tony Soprano. Cicero embodies menace precisely because his personality is so understated. His selective use of a paternalistic posture (reminiscent of Johnny Friendly's, a less-subtle character played by Lee J. Cobb in On the Waterfront) belies his absolute determination to sustain absolute control over his crime operations. Comparisons and contrasts of this film with Casino are probably inevitable. I think both are classics but for different reasons. The former is anchored in local experience, somewhat "small-time" crime if you will, whereas the latter examines the culture of an entire industry in which the scale and impact of crime are far greater. (The same point could be made about Godfather I and Godfather II, although I much prefer to view them in a chronological sequence.) Even in Casino, however, Scorcese constantly locks in on two or three characters in a specific situation. He is at his best when dramatizing the dynamics of verbal and physical violence in small scale (e.g. Raging Bull and The Gangs of New York). In my opinion, like Tolstoy, Scorcese's vision may be "epic" in certain films but the impact of his art is best measured in quite human terms...scene by scene, juxtaposing statement and response, action and reaction.</p></body></html>

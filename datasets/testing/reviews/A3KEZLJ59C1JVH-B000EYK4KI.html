<meta name="summary" content="Not good"></head><body><p>There has been so much hype surrounding this movie and I really expected it to be better than it was. The premise of "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" is pretty interesting: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play John and Jane Smith, a couple that has been married for five (or six) years and finds themselves stuck in a bit of a rut. John and Jane are both assassins, but neither of them are aware of their spouse's real profession. The truth comes out in a big way when their careers suddenly cross paths and their respective agencies order them to take each other out. Half of the movie revolves around the couple shooting at each other, but then they're both ultimately turned on by all the violence, which rekindles the passion in their marriage. Then their respective agencies decide that both assassins pose a conflict of interest because they're married, and the second half of the movie revolves around the Smiths working together to stay alive.<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed with this movie. It has a lot of potential because the premise is so interesting, and also because Pitt and Jolie have an undeniable onscreen chemistry. However, the script SUCKS! All these characters do is run around and shoot at people. Some people might enjoy that kind of thing, but I think the dialogue could have been much better and the relationship between John and Jane could have been scrutinized in much more detail.</p></body></html>

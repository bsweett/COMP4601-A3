<meta name="summary" content="With Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, it should be a lot better"></head><body><p>Rags to riches, it's the American dream. All too often in the movies, however, this dream is accomplished through crime. That's the story for Harlem gangster Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), who has no problem selling drugs and/or murdering people to get to the top.<br /><br />Lucas is mentored by Harlem crime boss Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson in the late 60s. He learns everything from Bumpy, the ins and outs of the business. When Bumpy dies of a heart attack, the city is wide open and waiting for the next person to take over. As Johnson's heir of sorts, Lucas feels it's his duty to collect on past debts and keep the neighborhood status quo. To do this, Lucas turns to selling heroin.<br /><br />With the assistance of his brother in Vietnam, Lucas manages to import 100% pure product, something with which even the slightest dosage a person becomes addicted. In no time at all he has the market cornered with his product, "Blue Magic", and he is a millionaire with street-cred, and some serious clout.<br /><br />His rise to fortune comes with unwanted fame and trouble, however. He has trouble from other local drug dealers, from corrupt cops looking for a bribe, and from legit cops looking for a bust. Lucas realizes the eventual burden and responsibility; so, he calls on his family members to work for him and do the majority of the actual crime. When this becomes too profitable, and when a death occurs at the hands of "Blue Magic", he attracts the attention of Det. Richie Roberts (Crowe), a gum-chomping, do-gooder, workaholic whose only mission in life is to catch criminals.<br /><br />Just as in "Training Day", Denzel Washington is mesmerizing, commanding attention as a person who seems to have no limits and no conscience. His evil side, or at least a character capable of evil as in "Man on Fire", is fascinating, a truly marks Washington as one of Hollywood's elite. In this movie, he does not disappoint. Likewise, Russell Crowe nails his role as Richie Roberts. The mannerisms, the speech, the ragged nature, all exude the exact feel and look of the character he's portraying. What's disappointing, however, is that there is no epic meeting of the stars like when DeNiro and Pacino met in the diner in "Heat". They barely share the screen, and the viewer is left wondering what could have happened if they locked horns in a truly important and powerful scene.<br /><br />Another knock on the movie is its length: a whopping 2 hrs 37 min. It wouldn't have been bad if there were more action, but that just isn't the case. Aside from three or four real action scenes, the movie is boringly slow at times, and drags in others. It's wonderful story telling, but j u s t a l I t t l e s l o w. As a connoisseur of gangster movies, I expected much more in the actual "committing crimes"-department, even if slightly insignificant, in only to keep blood pumping.<br /><br />Nevertheless, American Gangster is a worthwhile movie. The drama and storyline alone are worth the price of admission. To see two heavyweights like Washington and Crowe square off makes it all that much more enjoyable.</p></body></html>

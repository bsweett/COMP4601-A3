If that's the case then they are doing themselves, and the movie a major disservice, because this film is simply one of the best studio released movies of the year. Million Dollar Baby isn't really about boxing - it's about the value of friendship, the importance of loyalty, the betrayals of family, and the terrible price that one can sometimes pay for achieving one's dream.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby is a quiet, intimate, three-person drama, directed with Eastwood's trademark, easygoing style that is both humanistic and down to earth.  There's a visual simplicity to this film and an emotional directness that doesn't pull any punches with the viewer. Much of the film is set in a run down, shabby but tidy looking gym situated in the industrial heart of Los Angeles. Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the grizzled owner, and Morgan Freeman plays his best friend Eddie Dupris a former fighter (nicknamed Scrap) whom Frankie managed long ago and who now lives at the gym and also works there as a cleaner.<br /><br />Eddie and Frankie have a good relationship - a relationship that was formed through suffering and regret. Frankie has lost a daughter, his letters to her are returned unopened, and Scrap has lost an eye from a hard fight - but they never let this regret and sense of lament get to them. They are graceful and gentlemanly, and bare advancing age with a sense of humorless sentimentality. Scrap spars with the young would-be tough guys who hang out in the gym, while Frankie reads Yeats, studies Gaelic, and goes to Mass every day, mainly to annoy the prickly young priest with inane theological challenges.<br /><br />Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a waitress who shows up at his gym and won't take no for an answer. Frankie insists that he doesn't train girls, and since Maggie is already in her thirties she's too old to have much chance for glory in any case. But her combination of eagerness, enthusiasm, and discipline wear down Frankie's resistance, and he soon trains Maggie to fight with the best of them. But things don't go exactly as planned and it's downhill when a misguided trip to see Maggie's selfish and self-serving hillbilly family in Missouri ends in frustration and disappointment. The trip is a distressing and painful portent of the larger murkiness to come.<br /><br />Halfway through, the film takes a startling turn that most viewers will not see coming - it becomes dark and foreboding, and the focus of the story totally changes. Full of understated feeling, emotion and heart, the film gives astounding and absolutely heartfelt performances from its three leads, and Swank will probably be picking up the gold statuette for Best Actress, yet again, on Oscar night.<br /><br />Some of the fight scenes are indeed bloody - there's one particular scene where Maggie gets her nose broken, but the violence is never gratuitous and these scenes are quite riveting in the way they are staged. The highlight of the film, however, is the quiet, respectful relationship that develops between Maggie and Frankie. Maggie rediscovers her father in Frankie, and Frankie reconnects with his daughter in Maggie. The final part of the film is an emotional powerhouse of acting, and the decision that both Frankie and Maggie make will leave even the steeliest hearted viewer reeling. Million Dollar Baby is a fantastic ode to the underdog, and with its unobtrusive music score, its subtle cinematography, and its spot-on editing; it is quite simply one of the best films of 2004.

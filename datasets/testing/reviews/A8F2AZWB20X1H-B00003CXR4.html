<meta name="summary" content="Words cannot adequately describe this movie..."></head><body><p>...to really appreciate it, you have to feel it.  I cannot believe the shallow-minded reviewers who thought this movie was all about martial arts.  The martial arts were great to watch but they were secondary to the story.  CTHD is a tour de force which combines a terrific plot, two love stories, mind-blowing special effects, cinematography so exquisite it is almost off the planet, great directing by Ang Lee, and wonderful acting by everyone, even the minor characters.  Zhang ZiYi as Jen is awesome to watch, but as great as she is, it is Michelle Yeoh as Shu Lien who really carries the film.  Chow Yun Fat is excellent as the lead actor, Chang Chen is a delight as Jen's exuberant young lover who, in the end, can't hold onto her, and Cheng Pei Pei is total perfection as the evil Jade Fox.  I saw this film in VHS, which, thank God, is in Mandarin Chinese with English subtitles (it's a crime to mess up the purity of this film by dubbing it into English), and unlike the DVD version, the VHS edition has kept all the scenes of the original.  The hatchet job Sony did on the DVD edition just goes to show that some things are worth waiting for.  The VHS edition is the version to get.  It's the only one that does justice to the magnificent masterpiece that is this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Utterly disgusting"></head><body><p>I saw this movie after numerous friends saw it and recommended it to me.  By looking at its ratings on IMDB.com and other websites, it was supposed to be one of the funniest movies of 2006.  I was wholly disappointed.  As a minority, and someone who appreciates good racial and ethnic jokes, I found this movie's comedy to be a haphazard mix of derogatory, old-hat or just plain disgusting.  Much of the humor featured in this film has been included in older movies.  For example, the notion of Borat going from his backwards, ignorant, rural village in Kazakhstan to the wonders and cosmopolitanism of New York City is a storyline with too much play already.  The Beverly Hillbillies mastered this situational backdrop decades ago without the overt illusions to incest and personal violence made in this movie.  As another example, when Borat first enters his hotel room in NYC, he unknowingly refreshes himself with water from the toilet bowl.  A similar scene was used 20 years ago in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures in regards to the Mongol warrior.  The underwear scenes were also quite old as similar tricks have been used in old SNL skits and the movie Zoolander.  Even the bungled singing of the National Anthem by Borat seems to reminisce Roseanna Barr's blasphemy in front of a MLB game in the early 1990s.<br /><br />There were occasional, original funny scenes, such as the bear Borat adopts to defend themselves.  But these few scenes were drowned out by the quantity of jokes in poor humor.  This DVD does not feature much beyond the movie, and the labels of the different special features were hard to comprehend.  All in all, a waste of time and money.</p></body></html>

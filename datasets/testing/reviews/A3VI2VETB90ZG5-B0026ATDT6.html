<meta name="summary" content="Four-star Film...Two-star Disc Mastering"></head><body><p>They sure don't waste any time getting to it in this one! The recipe for a monster is presented right away followed by immediate mayhem. The rollercoaster ride basically is peak-dip-peak, yet the dip has a few jolting bumps in it as well. Overall the film is enjoyable.<br /><br />So many funny moments, from the family reunion to the cross-eyed doctor! The bronze medalist daughter is cool, too. A great varietal mix overall.<br /><br />The monster is flat-out awesome...very acrobatic, too.<br /><br />As for the disc, the menu screen is a bit cheesy, but nothing that should influence a purchase either way. However, during the feature you'll probably notice a lockup [on the copy I rented as well as those of many whose reviews I've read] both as the authorities place a sack over Park Gang-du's head, as well as after the screen fades out from the final action sequence (there's still alittle bit of movie left after that point). I was able to fiddle around with rewinding it and fast forwarding it to just after the lockup and got things moving again, but how lame it is to have to do that.<br /><br />I don't really recommend "buying" this disc to own, but I do feel it is a must see - either rent it or if you can handle the quirks go ahead and buy it...it is a cool movie. In the stores, I've discovered two HD DVD versions: product number 10100 (this one has a blu-ray logo in the misprinted label on back) and number 10101 (with proper HD DVD labeling). I do not know if the mastering errors have been removed on 10101, but if you're going to buy this disc I would recommend making sure it's the later print.</p></body></html>

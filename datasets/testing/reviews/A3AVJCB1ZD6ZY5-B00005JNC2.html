<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating character based comedy"></head><body><p>When we first see, Andrew Largemen (Zack Braff), he's a burnt out LA actor with what looks like a serious drug program. A call from his father (Ian Holm) and Andrew is on a plane headed back to New Jersey for his Mom's funeral.<br /><br />Turns out, his wheelchair-bound Mom drowned in a newly remodeled bathroom. His Dad wants to talk, but Andrew's clearly avoiding the family scene--and has been for the past nine years.<br /><br />While exploring his old home, Andrew gets caught back up in the party scene with his old friends. Some have succeeded.  Some have grown up and moved on to other careers. Yet others are pretty much the same.<br /><br />While seeing a neurologist on what at first appears to be a quest for more medication, Andrew meets Sam (Natalie Portman) a young girl who at first seems completely normal, but suffers from epilepsy and compulsive lying.<br /><br />As the layers of character are peeled back, you start to see both Andrew and Sam as far deeper people than the initial partying slackers.<br /><br />The star, Zack Braff of "Scrubs" also wrote and directed this film. It's a far deeper comedy than I would have expected and also has some excellent numbers for the soundtrack.<br /><br />Don't forget to check the out-takes on DVD.  They will have you laughing until you've got tears in your eyes.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, March 2009</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bizarre Thacther Biopic"></head><body><p>Meryl Streep recently won her third Academy Award for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  While Ms. Streep is her typical fantastic self, the film itself is a bizarre let down.  It starts in around 2008 and shows Ms. Thatcher in a semi-state of dementia.  She has visions of and converses with her dead husband Denis (Jim Broadbent).  Her past life is shown through a series of flashbacks.  The film spends too much time in the present showing her as a frail old woman fighting the demons in her mind then focusing on the potential powerful situations of her being the first woman to lead a country in the Western world. Mr. Broadbent plays his character like a complete loon and you can't understand why someone like that would haunt her mind. That being said, Ms. Streep inhabits the character and transforms herself into Margaret Thatcher completely.  While you can never argue when Ms. Streep wins an award, I thought she was much better in her three most recent nominated roles for Julie & Julia, Doubt and The Devil Wears Prada.  The film is worth watching strictly to see maybe the all-time greatest actresses in an Academy Award winning turn, but not much else.</p></body></html>

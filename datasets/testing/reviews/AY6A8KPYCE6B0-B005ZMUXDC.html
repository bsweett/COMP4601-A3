<meta name="summary" content="FIRST DISNEY CLASSIC SINCE THE '90s!"></head><body><p>Pixar aside, Disney hasn't made a movie this good since the renaissance 90's when we got classics like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, and Tarzan.<br /><br />Tangled is the story of Rapunzel and her long, lustrous, climbable hair, but like any iconic Disney adaptation there's plenty of twists and turns along the way.  The characters are all endlessly interesting, especially the two animal side-kicks who absolutely steal the show (despite being mute.)  The music is good, perhaps not '90s good, but still very enjoyable.  Mother Gothel is among Disney's best villains and her deliciously wicked song "Mother Knows Best" deserves to be among the greatest hits of all Disney musical numbers.<br /><br />The animation is, of course, breathtaking to behold--especially on Blu Ray.  The attention to detail and setting is what sets Disney apart from other computer animations.  Like the Beast's library or Belle walking through town, there are an endless number of images that will remain frozen in your mind for weeks, months, and probably years at a time.  I collect a lot of Disney movies but I still consider myself somewhat of a snob, if it's not during the Walt era (or one of the better '90s releases) I have a hard time justifying it for my collection.  With Tangled however, it is a no brainer.  This is the stuff of an instant classic, it'll be around for a long time.  You might as well take advantage of it now.</p></body></html>

It's about family and about discovering the individuality within that family while keeping both intact.<br /><br />The film centers on a rather tumultuous relationship between sisters Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and Rose (Toni Collette). Each sister is a complete opposite of the other yet bound by ties that run far deeper than surface appearances. Rose is the mousey responsible sister who tries to rescue Maggie, the flakey beautiful one, from self-destruction. As with all relationships complications arise, feelings get hurt and an inevitable split occurs. Into the picture arrives a long lost grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine) and everything is up for grabs. But it's the way the storytellers reveal each character's nuances that make this movie so special. It covers the ages with insecurities and doubts but heals the wounds with subtle intention.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz is truly wonderful in her role as Maggie and she brings to the role a depth she has rarely been able to delve into in her prior films. Toni Collette steals the show with her tremendous acting ability and Shirley MacLaine is given the chance to be the films stabilizing force. So there may be a closet full of beautiful shoes in this movie but they really aren't what it's all about. Beneath all the expensive heels and fancy slides lurks the truth of this family's hidden treasures. Trust me this movie will leave you skipping home barefoot in delight!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FX aside, this is pretty much poor filmmaking.  2.5 Stars"></head><body><p>Look, I love INDEPENDENCE DAY.  I mean, I loooooooove that movie!  It is one of my absolute favorite films of all time.  So when I heard that there was a new disaster epic from the man who brought us ID4, Roland Emmerich, I was naturally excited.  But THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is, in reality, a poorly-done message movie.<br /><br />For starters, ID4 had an actual adversary with which the humans had to battle.  In TDAT, the only enemy is the planet Earth.  Not a whole lot of room for conflict there, people.  Well, I suppose we the people who caused global warming are the real enemies, but by the time the movie begins there's nothing we can do, so there is still no room whatsoever for conflict.<br /><br />And that brings us to the film's real purpose: propaganda disguised as a summer blockbuster.  The filmmakers have themselves admitted that the president and vice president in this movie were intentionally molded after George Bush and Dick Cheney.  (Please note that I pretty much have no political views whatsoever and am not making this point based on them.)  Let's just say that subtlety is not one of this film's strong points.  The vice president is reduced to a less-than-one dimensional character raving about "ECONOMY! ECONOMY! ECONOMY!" and being unbelievably idiotic when it comes to anything but that.  And all the president does is ask the vice president what he thinks they should do.  Again, subtle, no?  The film's blatant political statements really drag the film down, and approach eye-rolling proportions.<br /><br />Speaking of eye-rolling, howabout the stacking-up of unecessary characters?  ID4 had a lot of characters, but all played important (or at least functionary) roles in the plot.  Not so in TDAT.  The filmmakers introduce numerou8s characters whose only purpose is to make the audience feel sad for them.  The best example: the sick little boy and the nurse saying "Where's Timmy's ambulance?"  Puh-leeze.  I felt sort of bad, but I was laughing in this scene, it was so frikkin shmaltzy.<br /><br />Okay, now for the pros.  Well, perhaps the biggest pro is that it ain't nearly as bad as GODZILLA was. However, the central characters are overall likeable and the acting is more than decent.  And let me tell you, the special effects are some of the absolute best you will ever see!  I mean, the stuff in this movie is remarkable!  Unlike the tidal wave in DEEP IMPACT, the gigantic wave in TDAT truly scared me (and I don't get scared at modern movies very easily), because it just looked so damn real!  For that scene alone it's worth picking up the movie for a rental.<br /><br />However, special-effects aside, it just all comes back down to the script.  Story-wise it's actually pretty good, even if it scientifically ludicrous.  If you go to these movies for scientific plausibility, you need to rethink some things.  The filmmakers do succeed in making the audience not care that this whole thing takes place in a manner of days (as they did in ID4).  And I really liked the aspect of the father journeying across subzero temperatures just to save his sone.  That was pretty well-done.  However, it's all just waaaay to corny.  The dialogue, the action scenes, pretty much everything is cliched and predictable.<br /><br />In conclusion, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a fun disaster flick that, to quote another reviewer, would make Irwin Allen proud.  Put your brain on zero and ignore the propaganda and the not-so-subtle moral to stop global warming and such, and just enjoy the sensational special effects, which in my opinion should have won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.</p></body></html>

Remind me to leave a note to my great grandchildren telling them not to sign up for military service!<br /><br />The film is VERY loosely based on R. Heinlein's classic novel and borrows only the barest elements of its plot. P. Verhoeven's soldiers are kids right out of highschool: niave, petulant and easily swayed by lofty speeches about honor and duty. That, and they are full of blood and internal organs that are just begging to be splattered all over the place.<br /><br />The movie's fun is in the preposterously gruesome battle scenes between hordes of alien 'Bugs' and the tiny, poorly trained pin-cushions otherwise known as Humans. The troopers move from planet to planet, hand delivering nukes to the bugs while dying horribly and in large numbers themselves. All of this is not to be taken seriously, neither is the mostly superfluous love triangle between the main characters.<br /><br />Just sit back and enjoy the slaughter, boobies (if that's your cup 'o tea), and sly social commentary. Higher level brain functions are not required, but will reveal some added depth. Dolby 5.1 audio is available, but extra features are limited to director commentary.</p></body></html>

"Coraline" continues this trend though to me is fairly darker than "Nightmare". A young girl named Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) moves to a small town with her parents and she's not happy about it, she finds her life here boring and she doesn't care for her parents inability to pay attention to her.<br /><br />One night she finds a blocked door which leads to a familiar world, but her parents are nicer, everything is happier and brighter and Coraline of course likes this world and would like to stay but her other "mother" (Teri Hatcher) wants her to sew buttons onto her eyes. This alarms Coraline and the rest of the film involves her trying to figure out the mystery of this other world.<br /><br />The visuals are top notch, the voice acting fits very well, the story is pretty detailed and there's some good elements of creepiness that make this film not really for younger kids. I personally enjoyed this film as everything just came together and made for a well rounded film. ***1/2 out of 4 stars.</p></body></html>

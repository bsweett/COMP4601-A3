<meta name="summary" content="The movie that barley dodged a 1 star rating from me"></head><body><p>Dodge ball is the kind of movie you have seen a thousand times about a guy trying to save something for him and hid friends and they happen to figure out a way how to do it that would never really happen in real life, but you know it will in the end of the film, because it's a movie.<br /><br />What's-his-face plays this guy who owns a gymnasium that needs $50,000 to keep his gym, other wise it will be repossessed (or something like that) by the bank. So they try to think up a way to get the fifty grand with a few weeks by any means necessary (legally). They decide they will enter the Dodge Ball competition where the grand final prize money is (wait for it, you'll never guess) fifty thousand dollars!!! Their rival team is Ben Stiller's annoying character who owns a much more stable and wealthier gym who has bought off the first mortgage of Joes gym and plans to turn Joes gym into a car park for his gym that happens to be right across the street. Will Joe get to the final and win the 50k? Or will Global Gym beat them and take over? I wonder???<br /><br />Ben Stiller is not an actor I hate, I did like him in "Something about Mary" so don't get me wrong when I say he is the downfall of this film. He plays an extra stupid fitness buff who owns a major gym. But his character is not funny, and his acting is extremely annoying. To set up a character for the audience to hate is ok, but to make them annoyed and wish he would just get off the screen is another. There is a difference between a villain and bad acting.<br /><br />This movie didn't seem to know which direction it wanted to go in with its approach to comedy in my opinion. Some of it seemed like it was trying to go for average family comedy or kids movie, other parts it would go for the smutty comedy approach, and then in-between here and there where bits of attempted wacky and goofy comedy like a slap stick kind of think. Those elements can work well together, but this new 1st time producer, whoever he is, needs to work out how to blend them properly or never get it right. It's kind of like a kid's first time out drinking booze, instead of sipping something light; he's grabbed everything from the top shelf and mixed a regretting combination. But one day he might learn to not mix his drinks. That's because this movie had potential to be absolutely hilarious, but it failed with the wrong ideas and jokes and didn't come out the way it could have been.<br /><br />The extra features are nothing to look forward to. The out-takes aren't funny, (except David Hasslehoff's, that made me laugh) the deleted scenes are pretty boring, the featurettes are slightly amusing in some parts. The alternate ending is ...eh. The commentary was buggered up because it actualy had JOKE COMMANTARY written on the back of the case. (2 thing's, don't write that it's a joke, it reuins it, and don't tell people there are eggs on the DVD, it's reuins the fact that there supposed to be hidden extras.. oh and 3, make the eggs worth looking at)but knowing it was a joke rueined the thing that I knew was an attempted false audio commantary to make you laugh,well it failed anyway, not much is funny about them arguing and pretending to hate each other and rustling chip packets and drinking beer, might have worked if they didnt write it was a joke on the case already before you've seen it. but then halfway through they decide to play the audio commantary from 'something about mary' which is stupid to do from the 40 minute mark to the very end of the credits, it did become quite boring after the 1st 10 minutes of listning to that half of it. There is a hidden audio commentary in the commentary selection screen if you press right on one of the options and you get to listen to the REAL commantary (WHY HIDE A COMMENTARY TRACK?). Still, there boring. The hidden eggs aren't worth looking at either.<br /><br />Dodge Ball failed to find it's mark because I had a hard time trying to figure out what kind of comedy it was supposed to be? Slapstick? Family? Smutty? or a Kids Comedy? But I could not just sit back and enjoy the film either, too much of it just didn't hit the right mark and was pretty cheap attempts at humour. Surprisingly tho it didn't contain a fart joke anywhere in the movie!!! The movie really needed to finish what it began with certain character elements and little things here and there. I'd recommend you watch BASEketball instead, yeah, watch the movie that this one tried to be in some ways.<br /><br />The movie has no lasting quality. I laughed at a few things the 1st time around. But on the second time around it was pretty stale. Ben Stiller's performance is very hard for me to watch. The humour doesn't last. It could have been such a better movie then it is. The bonus features are a snore fest. Cameos do not save the film, the movie might be a clich&eacute; of sports and to itself, but it's a "seen it before" movie. You have seen the basic element of this movies story line 1000 times. There is probably 2 lines in the whole movie I liked `cause I though they where funny and original, but not lasting or classic comedy.<br /><br />Thumbs down, but to say something good about the film, least it was better then a lot of the other junk released last year.<br /><br />And pretty much everyone I know whose seen this has the same reveiw as me... "I did not like the movie, but I loved the line Rip Torn said" so on that note let me say that this DVD is a iseless as a C*** flavoured lollypop.</p></body></html>

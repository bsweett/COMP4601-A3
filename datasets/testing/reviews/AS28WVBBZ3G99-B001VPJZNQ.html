<meta name="summary" content="Just Great Fun!"></head><body><p>The Rock lives up to his billing in this action adventure flick that is just plain fun!<p>The story is fast-paced, filled with action and smart. Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) has all the moves, muscles, and mouth to make this a rocking good story. Classic good vs evil plot makes this reminiscent of the Raiders of the Lost Ark trilogy. While the Rock gets top billing, Christopher Walken is the perfect bad-guy-you-love-to-hate.<p>The dialogue is crisp and surprisingly witty. This is a sit-back and enjoy your popcorn and cold beverage type of movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funniest movie in ages"></head><body><p>There's a lot to like in this movie. It has Amanda Seyfried looking like a younger and cuter Cameron Diaz. Then there's the chick-lit comedy that she leads (or tries to), about strange family secrets emerging on the eve of her wedding. Throw in Abba's bouncy music, likeable again now that the disco era is fading from memory. Then add Meryl Streep in a physically comedic role, with Pierce Brosnan and lots of others pulling their weight. You already know that it's going to end up OK - not just in the romantic plot, but as a movie, too.<br /><br />Lots more makes it work, as well. The ongoing visual gag of the "Greek chorus" never palls. A few points really stood out, like the bachelor party descending on the bachelorette party, merging them both into some neo-primitive fertility rite (clothes on, if it matters). But Streep and her co-stars really made this movie. She comes across as a strong and active, but decidedly mature character - as befits a woman whose age startled me when I looked it up on IMDB. Two other I-know-that-face actresses form a trio with her, and come from the same age group. I found it absolutely delightful to see these ladies being honest about their ages in these roles, but still as playful as schoolgirls, even to bouncing on the bed and to resurrecting their years-ago girl band to entertain Sophie's wedding eve. Maybe you have to be of the graying age to appreciate it properly, but it was great to see women of my age (and up) with exciting histories and plenty of goofy excitement in their present days, too.<br /><br />But, amid all these enjoyable parts, a few stand out. One was that massive dance routine to "Dancing Queen" - I laughed so hard that my eyes watered continuously the whole length of it. If you thought that the day of the musical comedy movie ended with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BKHU5G">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</a>, well, you had good reason to think that. New facts just came onto the scene, though, and the musical comedy is back again, at least this once. It's howling funny.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

No subject matter is, of course, off limits when it comes to filmmaking - and that includes nuclear annihilation - but one can at least demand that the context and the treatment it receives be commensurate with the gravity of that subject.  (One need only look back to 1983's "Testament" to see how this can indeed be done successfully).<p>Even putting aside the questionable nature of the material, "The Sum of All Fears" turns out to be a pretty weak action film overall, surprisingly lacking in tension and suspense despite the high stakes nature of its premise.  It's November 2002, and some higher-ups in the American government have discovered that a rogue nuclear missile is out there somewhere, most likely developed and planted by the quickly de-stabilizing Russian government.  Or was it?  Jack Ryan, that erstwhile hero of many of John Clancy's most popular novels, is the lone holdout who firmly believes that the bomb is NOT the work of the Russians but rather of some splinter terrorist group bent on setting off the device for their own nefarious purposes.<p>Ask not how Jack Ryan, in his current incarnation in the form of young Ben Affleck, has managed to shave a few decades off his age (we should all learn that secret).  What is amazing is that he seems to have regressed in stature as well.  In fact, for most of the film, Ryan seems like a wide-eyed schoolboy, completely incapable of holding his own with all the heavyweights in which he comes into contact.  Affleck, who managed to do some actual acting in the recent "Changing Lanes," is here reduced to a mere cipher, registering little more than openmouthed insipidity and rendering dull, emotionless line readings in the face of some pretty bland dialogue.  Despite the fact that he somehow manages to save the world (I thought Chris Rock did that just a few weeks ago in "Bad Company"), Ryan never establishes a core of gravitas that might make his character even slightly believable.  He is, in short, a mere bantamweight hero.<p>The first half of the film suffers greatly from the plodding direction of Phil Alden Robinson, whose style consists in having characters sit around in dark rooms talking to one another.  This is a particularly deadly technique when done in a wide screen format, since the effect of all those overblown close-ups coming one after another is to render the film strangely lumbering and static.  Things pick up a bit in the second half, but the filmmakers are forced to level an entire American city to accomplish it.  And even here, the pivotal scene in the film feels oddly truncated and aborted (one suspects that this depiction of urban destruction might have originally been longer and more elaborate but that sensitivity to the fears and emotions generated by the real life events of the past year may have encouraged the filmmakers to downplay it.  I know the trailer appeared more graphic).<p>When all is said and done, there just doesn't seem to be all that much urgency to anything that happens in "The Sum of All Fears," which is ludicrous considering the subject matter with which it is dealing.  This tone is particularly egregious in the final scene, a devil-may-care, happy-go-lucky conclusion that reminds us that Hollywood is never at a loss to find ways of demeaning even the most grave and sensitive of material.  In "The Sum of All Fears," even the possibility of the end of the world through mutually assured self-destruction turns out to be a yawner.</p></body></html>

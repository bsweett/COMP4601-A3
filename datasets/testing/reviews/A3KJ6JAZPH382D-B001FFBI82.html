<meta name="summary" content="War is a bore"></head><body><p>Anthony "Swoff" Swofford served in Gulf War One, and then came home to write about it. His gripping book, "Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles," was quickly optioned to be a movie. Where the book captures the fleeting explosions of adrenaline that briefly hits you between countless days of tedium, the film version really loads up the tedium.<br /><br />Really, this uninspiring true-life take on being a soldier may be the most honest take on war ever filmed. There are no heroics. No moments of raging brilliance to stop an enemy. Just hot sweaty men in a desert, scared as hell and maybe bored beyond it. What that translates to is tedious viewing. War is the long stretches of nothing between battles, and these long stretches form the majority of "Jarhead." If you're looking for "Saving Private Ryan," "Platoon" or even "The Boys of Company C," you're not getting any of that here. "Swoff" spends his entire stay in Desert Shield to Desert Storm wondering when he will finally get the chance to use his elite sniper training to make his first kill. The kill that never comes.<br /><br />"Jarhead" comes closest to mimicking the superior "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQF">Full Metal Jacket</a>" in that the drollness of Swofford matches Private Joker in Kubrick's film. But "Jarhead" has no payoff. Theirs is a place where no point of view ever happens...what politics there are in the movie will come strictly from your own point of view. The film itself is visually stunning, I doubt if the scene where oil rains down on Swoff's unit in the night, the desert lit only from flaming oil wells will easily be forgotten, or the horrific "highways of death" recreation. (Google that reference for the background.) Jake Gyllenhaal gives an eerie performance, the emotions bubbling under his facade. (Almost as good as his turn in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JOFQ">Brokeback Mountain</a>.")<br /><br />But again, I return to the movie's pace and subject matter. It really is too slow and random to be truly entertaining, and yet its lack of any real point of view makes it hard to really dig into the charachters here. Just like Swofford, you spend the duration of "Jarhead" waiting for the time when you finally see some action. The "I am always going to be a Jarhead" ending makes you wish for a deeper explanation as to why.</p></body></html>

Hellboy has some amusing quips as he battles the bad guys, but this is a superficial movie unlike the previously mentioned movies.  Although Hellboy gets knocked around, there is never any doubt he will prevail.  Also, not much original here as the title suggests this is just a mix of the X-Men and Men in Black.  Worth a rent, but not a buy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pan's Portals"></head><body><p>`Pan's Labyrinth' is a powerful movie voyage that juxtaposes the horrors of war with an enchanting world of the imagination.  Set in Francisco Franco's Spain as his infant Fascist government comes to power,  the film takes place in 1944, while the Allies are defeating the Axis, and Franco is fighting guerrillas in exile.  Ofelia has felt the grip of both worlds.  A near adolescent, she is torn between the reality of war that has taken her father, and the portals of imagination that help her flee from harm. She has a brutal step-father, Captain Vidal, who has impregnated her mother, Mercedes, and displaced them from her familiar surroundings to a military stronghold in the country.  As complications come upon Mercedes' pregnancy, Ofelia is horrified to see her mother hemorrhaging.  An avid reader, her books start to come to life as the details of her new arrangement become more menacing.  Characters from an underground world, such as a faun, offer her adventure and  solutions to key problems above.  They are often linked to the world of reality with tangible portals, such as chalk, a book, and keys.  Walking sticks become fairies, and so forth.  In the meantime, the audience is given the full force of truth from which Ofelia is partly spared.  There's the business of war:  espionage, fighting, and torture.  'Pan's Labyrinth' effectively blends together a tale of innocence and cruelty where both worlds meet and have meaning.<br /><br /> I couldn't help but think that this movie is an artful leap from the old `Calvin and Hobbes' comic strip with, obviously, more weighty subject matter.  I also am reminded of  PC adventure games like 'Myst' that propel players to different realms.  (Any of these comparisons are merely meant to be hints or suggestions.  The genius of this movie comes to fruition on its own terms.)  Pan's Labyrinth' has fine special effects, but don't expect to have a myriad of creatures jumping out at you on the screen like blockbuster films. This movie, rather, tells its story well and explores the worlds of reality and imagination in a special way that reflects upon both.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="[3.5]-Books adapted to films are the hardest to please."></head><body><p>After finally viewing this film last night I thought it was alright. Movies such as this seem to be a great challenge for directors. This story been read by so many and I know the film is almost 2.5 hours long, but this could, and should have been a bit longer or expanded in the correct places. The first 200 pages of Dan Brown's book are adapted into about 20 minutes. All of the anagrams, the Fache (Jean Reno) stuff, investigating the crime scene. ALL of that goes by in an incredibly rushed 20 minutes. You have to give those 20 minutes your full, undivided attention or you'll miss important details. Langdon being Fache's number 1 suspect isn't the least bit surprising. You had just been introduced to both characters 2 minutes beforehand. The film finally decides to slow down and take it's time once we meet Ian Mckellen's character, Leigh Teabing. They should have added at least 30 minutes to the first 20 minutes, and probably put some of those extra minutes into the irksome flashy flashback sequences.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good. Tom Hanks has his weak points in the film, but he's given such little time to react to things, I don't blame him. He gets better as the film goes along. The same can be said about Audrey Tautou. If the film wasn't so swift, I'm sure they'd give great performances. Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Ian Mckellen and Alfred Molina all gave good performance. I'm not surprised that Dan Brown had Jean Reno in mind for Fache when he was writing the book. Ian Mckellen is great as the lovable and humble old man, Teabing. In my opinion, he has the best lines in the film. And Paul Bettany stands out as the albino monk, Silas. I think he gave the best performance in the film.<br /><br />Ron Howard does a good job in the directing chair but if he hadn't rushed and gave more respect to the first 200 pages of Dan Brown's novel I'd probably give this film a higher rating. I do recommend this film but it's better to read it before you see it.</p></body></html>

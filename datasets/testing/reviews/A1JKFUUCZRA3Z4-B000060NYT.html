<meta name="summary" content="Started out scary, then got silly"></head><body><p>This movie started out scary enough that when my phone rang 10 minutes into it, I jumped.  It successfully captured the spookiness one feels while driving down a deserted highway.  It also successfully spooked me out when the siblings are chased down by a car, when they see a hooded man dump human-size wrapped sacks down a pipe and also by what Justin Long sees when he goes down that pipe.  I thought Long did a credible job acting terrified.<br /><br />However, this is also one of those movies where the victims make really stupid decisions.  For example, after getting chased down by the vehicle, the brother yells out the window to insult the guy.  But who would be foolish enough to provoke a psychopath?<br /><br />Even more foolish than that was him going down the pipe at all.  Who would be foolish enough to go down a pipe after just witnessing dead bodies getting dumped into it?  He gives a reason, but most sane people would go straight to the police instead.  I think the writer must've suspected viewers would have this reaction because the sister tells her brother not to act like one of those stupid people in horror films...and yet, they still act like them anyway.<br /><br />Shorlty after that scene, after seeing the monster attack someone in their car, the sister walks up to the car to investigate.  And when they see the creature, they don't immediately run, but instead just stand there as he eats someone.  Again, what?<br /><br />These foolish decisions pulled me out of my initial scared reaction, but so, too, did the scenes with the psychic as well as having the song "Jeepers Creepers" accompany a kill.  I understand the intent of the cheerful music was to make a kill seem more disturbing, but the intent was so obvious it didn't work for me.  The ending didn't work for me either because it was more silly than scary.</p></body></html>

Mr. Van Sant does a superb job of showing the persecution and struggle for equal rights the gay community faced without getting overly preachy and self-righteous.  He superbly weaves archival footage into the film and his use of footage showing Anita Bryant spouting her anti-gay rhetoric shows her icy malice with far greater impact than any actress could convey (George Clooney used the same technique with Joseph McCarthy in his film Good Night & Good Luck).  Mr. Penn, as he is apt to do, dives completely into the role and transforms himself into Milk while James Franco, Josh Brolin and the rest of the cast provide him with strong support.  Milk succeeds in being both informative and entertaining.</p></body></html>

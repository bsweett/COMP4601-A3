<meta name="summary" content="blu ray done right."></head><body><p>There's alot more detailed reviews of this classic film on blu ray on amazon. Still I had to express how great this blu ray version is. So many movies like the 'horsesoldiers' or 'kelly's heroes'are just thrown out on blu ray; unrestored with dirt on the prints even! it's so bad that you would only pray that each new blu release is going to be done better. NO worries here , this is remastered and looks fantastic! the sound is fantastic, the movie is one of the beloved musicals ever! Julie andrews is perfection in this movie and the songs are beyond classic mostly. Even christopher plummer is awesome and he is not known for musicals! He's still at it in movies too, making great roles as usual.  But this blu ray has set a high standard for what older movies SHOULD look like on blu ray. Buy this one and watch it with someone you love, it's restored and hassongs that will appeal to any age group.</p></body></html>

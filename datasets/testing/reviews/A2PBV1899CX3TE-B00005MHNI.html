<meta name="summary" content="Masterpiece in Orange, and Malcolm McDowell in the Middle"></head><body><p>I saw that there were 699 reviews of this film, and much as I like that number, I had to weigh in and make it an even 700. Stanley Kubrick directed this, and if he ever goes to Film Hell for Eyes Wide Shut, this will more than make up for it, at least it will get him into purgatory.<br /><br />Anthony Burgess wrote this in response to hearing about some controversial techniques that were proposed as a solution to the problem of teen violence, specifically the Mod vs. Rocker battles that were also the subject of The Who's Quadraphenia.<br /><br />The book is written entirely in Nadsat, which is a slanguage invented by Burgess that contains Russian words, Gypsy argot, Cockney rhyming slang (where a word is substituted for another that rhymes with it, or is connected somehow to the rhyming word, so the original connection is lost and only another Cockney would understand the reference) and other teen age slang words all mixed together. A glossary is included, but soon you'll have no need for it.<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell does a great performance, though he is much older than 15, the supposed age of the Beethoven lovin' hooligan, Alex. He has a certain boyish charm, and the panache to carry it off.<br /><br />This film is a lot like V for Vendetta, in that it could work as an action film, or be enjoyed on a deeper level as a thought provoking essay on society, violence, and classical music. In both movies the cinematic violence is exhilarating, really good use of the music to enhance the excitement, and just an artistic stylized look that draws you in to the strange dystopia of the future.<br /><br />Some people will be put off by the violence, but it is not merely gratuitous, but essential to the story, and in fact, the subject at hand. You could say Oliver Stone fell into that trap in Natural Born Killers, trying to make a statement about how the media glorifies and exploits violence, and in so doing just glorifying and exploiting it even more, but Stanley Kubrick has dodged that bullet--at least he dodged it until Eyes Wide Shut.</p></body></html>

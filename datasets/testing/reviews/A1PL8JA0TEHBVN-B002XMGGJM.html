<meta name="summary" content="STUNNING PERFORMANCES WITH NICE DRAMA!"></head><body><p>Well, I was expecting this to be an okay movie with everything on its place and nothing else. But actually this is one very good film with two MAJOR quality elements here:<br /><br />FIRST<br />The performances are amazing. Both Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx are STUNNING. Their characters are complex and all motivational elements were beautifully written. Foxx is no surprise, but Butler did surprise me. I wasn't expecting him to be such a great actor... but he is.<br /><br />SECOND<br />The premise is brilliant: a man has to deal with the fact that the man who murdered his family gets a deal. This is amazing material,<br /><br />Not so great things: unfortunately, as the second half unfolds, the film tries to become a heavy thriller (and gets a little contrived) and somehow tends to forget the amazing premise and drama it started with.<br /><br />Still... this is a very good film to watch.</p></body></html>

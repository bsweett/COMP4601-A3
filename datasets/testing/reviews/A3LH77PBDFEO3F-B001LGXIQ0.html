Granted, I have never been a big fan of the TV show, so maybe I am not the target audience, but after some pretty good reviews from reviewers that I often agree with, I thought I'd give it a shot, and as I said, it wasn't a bad movie, but I'm glad that I only rented the video on demand from Amazon, because I doubt that I would want to re-watch this movie again.<br /><br />So here's the deal, if you LOVE 'Get Smart' you will probably like this movie very much; however, if you just like Steve Correl, Ann Hathaway and the Rock, then I would just rent this like I did.</p></body></html>

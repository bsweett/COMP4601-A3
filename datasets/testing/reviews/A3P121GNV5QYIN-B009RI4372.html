<meta name="summary" content="Sam Rami became a legend after this"></head><body><p>I saw the Evil Dead movies backwards,from 3,2,1.I don't know which one is my total favourite because all of them are great,but I can tell you this one is the sickest of them all.It starts off slow,but builds up as it goes along.I thought is had a claustrophoic look to it,it feels like you're with those five people in the cabin.I really loved the look of the movie,dark,gory,funny and the deadits look really cool,well I was 11 when I saw it.It's one hell of a ride.There's neat bits of Texas Chiansaw Massacre and Night Of The Living Dead in this classic horror picture.Why can't they make horror movies like this anymore.The DVD as alot of cool special features.I recommond this film to anykind a movie fan,you'll love it</p></body></html>

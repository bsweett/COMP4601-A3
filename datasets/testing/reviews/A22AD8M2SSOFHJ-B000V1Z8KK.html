<meta name="summary" content="Good action but the same old story"></head><body><p>I hope you are not looking for a movie that is a totally new storyline.  This movie doesn't really dwelve deep into a story.  It is actually quite political and for those paying attention their are some jabs at the current administration.  I wont get into that part but it is there.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed was the almost constant action.  It was intense from the get go without being overly violent.  Mark Wahlberg is an excellent actor and that is evident here.  The movie starts with soldiers on a top secret mission.  Wahlberg is a sniper and his spotter gets killed in the first part of action.  This causes Wahlberg to retire until he is called back into action by the US government.<br /><br />The movie doesn't get stale at any points and is constantly moving.  You don't need to put much thought into anything that happens since it is explained well.  The movie goes from location to location all over the United States and has a climatic almost predictable finish.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun action movie where you can get into the intensity this is it.  I would say this is a must have for any action afficianodo.  Also it's almost a must have for anyone with a home theatre set up.</p></body></html>

The effects are pretty-well done -- bridges coming off their moorings, guys shooting lasers from their eyeballs, people disintegrating or running through walls, etc.<br /><br />The basic story is this: a "cure" has been found for the mutations that gave rise to the X-Men. Evil villain Magneto (Ian McKellen) is trying to destroy the cure and raise a mutant army to do goodness knows what. Good guy Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) doesn't want the cure destroyed, for equally unclear reasons. The ensuing face-off is completely confusing and pointless, although very fun to watch. Lots of people, cars and houses getting levitated with mind control; lots of flaming, flying cars and lots of general mayhem. In the midst of this, characters are still trying to come to terms with their "talents" and wondering whether to take the cure and become normal. Scattered love interests add fiery arcs to this celestial fireball of a movie.<br /><br />"X Men III" is great if you just want to have a good time and not think too much about plot consistency and plausibility -- like why superheros need to walk "en masse" to the their targets (rather than fly teleport or whatever) or why the government doesn't just "cure" all the bad guys rather than transport them overland in vulnerable trucks, etc.<br /><br />But the mutants are fun -- one guy has porcupine quills, another shoots darts from his hands -- and Juggernaut (my fave) -- rolls through just about anything. Though I still can't get my mind around Kelsey Grammer's "Beast" who looks more like a big blue Furby than anything dangerous. Check your inner critic at the door and have a good time.</p></body></html>

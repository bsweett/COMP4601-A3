<meta name="summary" content="0 STARS: Another remake that stinks."></head><body><p>One really has to wonder where Hollywood will end in its relentless determination to remake every single horror movie that was ever made.  Admittedly, the original "The Wicker Man" really is not a good horror movie to begin with.  In short, the original is an interesting portrayal of a paganistic society, but it is not scary, nor is it very interesting or entertaining.<br /><br />As undynamic as original "The Wicker Man" is, the remake relishes in its own futility beyond belief.  Nicholas Cage was just awful in his role as the police officer, and the rest of the cast turned in forgettable performances at best.  The liberties with the original script that the makers of the remake took are of negligible effect except to perhaps bring an already boring movie down to an even lower level of insipidity.  Aside from the poor acting, my first thought after seeing the remake was, "what is the point?"  It simply did not make any sense to remake this movie at all.  It seems Hollywood's reasoning to remake old horror films (other than to just make money of course) is to give the film a present-day feel to it.  I don't really see the point though because what inevitably happens is that the atmosphere and mood of the original is forever lost in the remake's new age flavor.  Hence, an exercise in futility is the end result.  Such is the case with the remake of "The Wicker Man".<br /><br />In all fairness, everyone should see the original "The Wicker Man" at least once.  Christopher Lee's hairdo in the movie is simply fabulous--in a humorous kind of way of course. :)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rip! Tear! Blood! Guts!"></head><body><p>Okay all of you comic book lovers out there, let's look at this film for a minute. And I don't mean check out the nice hooters on this gal or that, or watch neon-yellow blood spurt from a man's ...uh ...private area as they're ripped off. I mean LOOK at the film.<br /><br />I love to watch action in films as much as the next gruesome guy. I enjoyed the new release of SERENITY in theaters. And I thought PULP FICTION and KILL BILL were pretty darn good films, too. But they had a POINT!<br /><br />What was the plot of SIN CITY? Can anyone tell me? What was the purpose behind all this bloodshed?<br /><br />For me, there has to be action and reactions to bloodletting, not just violence for the sake of violence.<br /><br />I will say that it was engaging to watch the black and white sceenshots mix with bright colors, but that's just visuals. There HAS to be more.<br /><br />Now I'm not a tree-huggin', peace-marching, free-lover, but if you want to see part of what's wrong with our culture of violence, check out this film. It has sex, violence during sex, disembowling procedures, disembowling during sexy scenes, and ...oh yeah, more violence.<br /><br />Holy bashed-in brains, Batman!</p></body></html>

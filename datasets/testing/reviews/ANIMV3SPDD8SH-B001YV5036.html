His relentless grim picture of hungry children with bronchrial coughs in cold city tenements is like finding a razor blade in an apple off The Walton's family tree. Times are tough all over, but you gotta do what you gotta do, even if you tearfully promised your son, on word of honor, that you'd never split up the family. I think Howard wrung an emotionally soaking wet rag dry, just to set us bleeding heart saps up for the exhilerating ride to the rewarding, climactic world title boxing match. Starting off like a morality play, typical of the era, with ragged parents on snowy city streets looking for food for their family, the movie then uses the violent, blood-spitting sport of boxing as the only cultural alternative to both the hopelessness of the depression, and the cynical and maudlin voice of the media of the day. A happy ending to a dumb drama might help depression audiences cheer up a bit, but seeing a guy punch the living daylights out of an established, cocky world boxing champ, will send them out into the streets roaring with approval. Ron Howard's extravagant, artsy camera work only enhances the film; the stop action camera flashes during boxing bouts nail home the graceful strategies of boxing, Russell Crowe walking down a city street while all around him becomes a blurred image, conveys well the character's deepening isolation. The leads and supporting cast are excellent, the historic details are meticulous, blah, blah, blah, but it's the horrific edge of World Boxing Champ Max Baer, he killed some guys in the ring, played by Craig Bierko, that gives the film reason to rally around the hero and strike up a round of 'For He's A Jolly Good Fellow'.</p></body></html>

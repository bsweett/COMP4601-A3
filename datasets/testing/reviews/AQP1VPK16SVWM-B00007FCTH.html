<meta name="summary" content="2011-Revised for Blu-ray review-A well put together tribute to classic film"></head><body><p>Is this Welles' greatest film? That's open to debate but it is a stunning debut that set a standard difficult to follow. At the ripe old age of 26 after a steady diet of theater, literature and performance Welles decided to turn his gaze on the one art form he really hadn't mastered. After watching John Ford's Stagecoach (and one can assume a number of Hitchcock films as well), Welles and his collaborators Herman J. Mankiewicz, cinematographer Gregg Toland and film editor Robert Wise created one of the enduring classics of American cinema.<br /><br />Edit: The Blu-ray edition of this film is exceptional and an improvement over the previously over processed DVD released a decade ago. Warner has done an exceptional job of restoring the film to Blu-ray providing fans with a sharp looking presentation with previously unnoticed detail (at least on home video) and a far more film-like presentation.<br /><br />Keep in mind that while Welles was in charge, Mank, Toland and Wise all played a substanial part in helping to create this classic film. All of this helps explain why Welles had a difficult time following up on Kane; he only worked with Toland and Wise once again and never with Mank. The Magnicient Ambersons is a near classic that fails primarily because of the botched version eventually released.<br /><br />This deluxe set has all the extras you could possibly ask for: the commentary tracks by Ebert and Bogdonovich are complimentary and quite different; the documentary is quite good at illuminating the infighting that went on in creating this film. This edition on Blu-ray includes "RKO 281" the docudrama about the making of the film from HBO.<br /><br />For those who appreciate Welles' film this is the ultimate edition.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

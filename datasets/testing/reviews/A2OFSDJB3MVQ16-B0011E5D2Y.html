<meta name="summary" content="Vince & Owen score a touchdown"></head><body><p>After looking at some of the negative reviews this hilarious comedy received--I've come to the conclusion that some people don't have a sense of humor or are stiff as board. Besides they were forewarned that this is an R-rated comedy!!  Not since Carl Reiner's classic R-rated comedy, "Where's Poppa", never have I laughed so much in a theatre--and I've seen this flick 3 times-twice in a theatre, once on video.  Vince Vaughn really scored big in this film even more than Owen Wilson and he's probably the only reason one would consider seeing his next film, "The Break-Up".  If there were any awards for comedy, one should go to Vaughn for this hilarious film. I guess the only complaint I had about this film were--where were the beautiful Africain American sisters since the duo did score with the Indians, Hispanics and the Jews in their scam.  Anyway if you're ever depressed, go check this out--it'll cure you of the blues!!</p></body></html>

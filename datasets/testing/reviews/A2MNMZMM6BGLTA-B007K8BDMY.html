Herzog takes the beautiful footage that Timothy Treadwell took himself and mixes it with his own fantastic voice overs and narration and also interviews with friends and people close to the story. Treadwells footage in itself would be compelling enough for anybody to watch, nature lover or not. But Herzog delves deeper into the story and deeper into who Timothy Treadwell was and what made him tick.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and I encourage anybody to watch it. Even if you are not one to watch documentaries I think this story has the chops and is so wonderfully done and Treadwell and the Bears are so fascinating that you can't take your eyes off of it. Hollywood could not have written a story so compelling and if they did nobody would have believed it.</p></body></html>

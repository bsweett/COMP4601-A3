It also was marketed in an exploitive way, with the cover art to the DVD reflecting that. There's no easy way to sum up the doomed Tim Treadwell and his brave, foolish, desperate, crazed, idealistic visits to the fatally-attractive "Grizzly Maze" in the Alaskan wilds, so I'll leave further analysis to others. What I will simply say here is that this documentary, assembled as I'm sure everyone knows, from the footage Treadwell left behind after his 2003 mauling death, makes for the sort of film you watch closely despite somehow not wanting to. The scenes captured are stunning and unlike anything one would expect to see, as Tim Treadwell lived among grizzly bears in their native habitat. We observe Tim sitting calmly within a few yards of bears as they eat, fight, rest, and at times investigate Tim right back.  I was struck at Treadwell's demented courage, even as I shook my head at his naivet&eacute;, for he somehow seemed to believe the love he felt for these beasts would shield him against them. He spoke openly of the possible consequences of what he was doing but then again he so anthropomorphized the bears with sweet pet names that it was as if he never truly thought a violent end would ever come. Finally two concluding observations. One is I think more time should have been allotted to Amie Huguenard, who also died in the bear attack on that awful day, and secondly, German filmmaker Werner Herzog was probably the best possible individual to have combed through Treadwell's confessional-like footage in order to create this morbidly voyeur-esque tribute to a unique man who could rightly be described in many contradictory ways.</p></body></html>

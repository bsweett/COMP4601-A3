<meta name="summary" content="Noir Mess"></head><body><p>Brian DePalma has crafted a film that is all style with very little substance. The Black Dahlia murder was one of the great unsolved mysteries and this film does little to shed any light on those events of 1947. Based on James Ellroy's novel of the same name the film follws the exploits of two Los Angeles policeman who are drawn into the investigation of the murder.<br /><br />This sounds like an interesting premise but what the viewer gets is an overly complicated (unintelligible) story line that involves corrupt cops an bizarre love triangle and a murky bisexual look a like of the dead girl from one of the strangest Hollywood families you will ever witness.<br /><br />The film as mentioned above looks great the Oscar nod for its photography was on the mark. The set design is also fantastic but the praise stops there. The acting by both Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart is wooden. Scarlett Johansson who seems to be near perfect in everything she does is horrible here as the love interest of both leads. And Hilary Swank gives a wierd performance as the bisexual look a like of the murder victim.<br /><br />If you were looking for greatness from DePalma look elsewhere.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Russell Crowe carries this film"></head><body><p>Interesting film, and a good expose of a modern crime boss. Denzel is very good as Frank Lucas, and his motivations are well explored. However, Russell Crowe has an amazingly complex role, and handles his material like a super-pro. This took place during the same time frame as Frank Serpico, and good cops had a really tough time. Ridley Scott did a fine job in bringing out the complexities of the narrative and the characters. Period detail, even though it was only in the 60's, was right-on, and it's always nice to see Ruby Dee, if even so briefly. Fine as she always is, I'm sure she won her awards because of who she is; she certainly wasn't challenged in this role (I liked her a lot in the TV version of "The Stand"). As a history lesson, this is worth a look. Production values are high, and the second DVD disc fills in a lot. Worth seeing...</p></body></html>

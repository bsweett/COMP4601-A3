<meta name="summary" content="The Director's version butchers the movie"></head><body><p>The Theatrical version is actually better than the director's version. The story is told in a much better manner.<br /><br />Even the director's version is missing some material. Like at the very end of the movie, the Theatrical version has a slightly longer ending because you'll hear a narrator's voice explaining the conclusion of the movie. In the director's version, the narrator's voice is cut from the ending.<br /><br />The Theatrical version has a few other pieces that are not shown in the director's version.<br /><br />You're better off with the Full-Screen Theatrical version.</p></body></html>

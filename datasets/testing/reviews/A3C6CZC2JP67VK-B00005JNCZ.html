<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful film that makes you want to travel."></head><body><p>I was able to watch "The Motorcycle Diaries" today and Walter Salles is no ordinary director. I am pleased to see that he convincingly managed to overcome geographical barriers, to accomplish a high standard of film making. The cinematography is truly gorgeous, and reminded me how little of the South American landscape we ever see on film in the U.S. The cinematographer has pulled off a major feat in shooting a period film in slightly grainy, sometimes shaky hand-held. No crane shots or sepia tinting here-the film quality immerses you in Guevara and Granado's experiences and makes them feel very immediate, without sacrificing any sense of history. A film like this is long overdue, and it deserves wide distribution.<br /><br />"Diaries" runs smoothly and effortlessly, without a trace of boredom. It is frequently funny and it makes the audience aware of deep emotions inside the minds of two young adventurers, who were bound to change their lives forever. I am glad that "Diaries" did not try to make a political speech or to explain to us why Guevara was a revolutionary man. It simply shows two friends traveling together, with completely different personalities but profound affection and respect for each others idealism.<br /><br />Upon reading the credits, one can clearly see that this is joint project, done by people who are deeply involved with good, non-commercial film making. Also, Gael Garcia and Jaime Az&oacute;car are artists in their own right. Their performance is truly first-class, yielding a special significant to the development of the characters and the credibility of the film. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

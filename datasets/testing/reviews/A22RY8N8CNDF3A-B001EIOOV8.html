<meta name="summary" content="Too Much Gore and Foul Language"></head><body><p>Martin Scorsese directs this movie about Las Vegas set in the 1970's and 80's.  The mob is in control and then goes out of control.  The whole story makes you want to take a shower and find a safe place.<br /><br />"Casino" is a story of Las Vegas glamorous past and fairy tale exterior.  The mob runs rampant beneath the glitz and glitter as we see the stark contrast of blood money and the beautiful people who own beautiful things.  "Casino" shows the rise of a casino owner with mob connections (Robert De Niro), his friend and Mafia underboss (Joe Pesci) and in ex-prostitute with a strong will and expensive taste (Sharon Stone).<br /><br />Based on a true story, overall it is just too much of everything, blood, gore, gangsters and drugs.</p></body></html>

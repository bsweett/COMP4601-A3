<meta name="summary" content="Hannibal Unmasked is almost a page for page adaptation"></head><body><p>In `Silence of the lambs' both Clarence Starling and Dr. Frederick Chilton desperately try to unravel the monster that is Hannibal Lector. While Chilton fretted over figuring out what made Hannibal tick to broker a book deal, Starling was all too busy trying to solve a crime while becoming emotionally attached to a psychopath. The enigma of Hannibal Lector is what drove that detective story. The sequel `Hannibal' is a pure tale of horror with Hannibal on the loose in society. Within the framework of that story one tempting revelation came to pass... that Hannibal had been through a traumatic World War II experience involving his family and starvation. Nothing could have been more deliciously tempting. Let's face it by the end of `Hannibal' it was the single most mouth-watering eye-opener into the Hannibal diagnosis since we learned that his pulse did not go above 72 while chewing on a nurse.<br /><br />`Hannibal Rising' serves up the best dish yet. The whole movie is one big boiling frothing pot that feeds a Harris fan's ravenous need. For those who are interested, you will be licking the spoon and asking for more. Not only that but this movie is a whole new type of thriller. Who can accuse Harris of being uninspired and clich&eacute;d? The risk of `Hannibal' is worth the experience of `Rising' and then some more. Harris should be commended for rattling our brains and stomach with suggestive images of a boiling child's bath tub while relating it to the horrific incident that is slowly revealed throughout the frames.<br /><br />We get one most realistic depictions of a post-WWII France. Hannibal (a tremendously impressive Gaspard Ulliel), a young holocaust survivor of an all different type, has gaps in his memory and tries to remember the horrible thing that happened to him. Brought up and educated to higher than high standards, his only relation his Japanese aunt (Li Gong, a wonderful addition with Samaria swords and masks included!), the damaged child ferments between the cuts, encountering incidents that illuminate the darkness to reveal an evil so unsettling that drives him on to a type of shocking avenge operation for a motive that exposes you to a awfulness that you have never experienced before. This is a whole lot more than just flirting with the insane. This is exactly what intelligent horror should be. It might be Hannibal 4, but that does not mean it is not good. I thought it was one of the best sequels in recent memory. Not "S.O.L.T", but it can stand alone as a damn fine serial killer movie with plenty of brains to boot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Little Miss Sunshine shines best in the indy light"></head><body><p>Little Miss Sunshine is best viewed as the surprise sleeper independent film that made it big. The problem is, I don't know that that's true. From the first trailer, I felt that this film was branding itself as such, before anything like that had happened. If this film had come out a few years ago, before we had Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State, and even Wes Anderson films like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, it might be more groundbreaking. Also, is a film really independent when it stars Alan Alda, Greg Kinnear, and Steve Carrell (the fastest rising name in comedy besides Sacha Baron Cohen)?<br /><br />The truth is, this film is an interesting, sometimes funny, almost poignant look at a dysfunctional family. However, most of the circumstances that take place in the film are at best slightly unbelievable, at worst entirely silly. Often a huge argument will erupt, only to be settled seconds later. The entire premise of the film is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />On the other hand, all of the acting is superb. Steve Carrell is surprisingly successful as a depressed Proust scholar... I could go on about the rest of the cast, but they all nail their characters. The standout is little Abigail Breslin as young Olive, who has a Dakota Fanning-esque acting talent which really makes the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is an enjoyable film, but really that's all it is. It doesn't live up to its great hype, and it never transcends its "I'm a quirky independent film, love me" style. It's nice to see an original film in a time when our theatres are packed full of remakes, but Little Miss Sunshine isn't the hallmark of quality that it's made out to be.</p></body></html>

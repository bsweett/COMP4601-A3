<meta name="summary" content="Very good but not up to Pixar's other greats!"></head><body><p>In a world where cars rule, celebrity race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) had a swanky lifestyle of fortune and glory until one uneven night when he's on his way to the major race coming soon in California, Lightning gets left behind accidently. He's left stranded in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs on Route 66 where he accidently damages the town's road as he's forced by the locals to fix it, during his stay he befriend Sally (Bonnie Hunt), former race car champion Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), redneck truck Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), and  Ramone (Cheech Marin) as he really wants to get to the race until he realizes that he has to help the poor unfortunite town back to it's original glory.<br /><br />Very entertaining and sometimes funny yet witty Pixar Cgi animated comedy is well done but no where on the quality as Pixar's other movies like "Toy Story 1 & 2", "Monsters Inc.", "Incredibles", "Finding Nemo" and the highly underrated "A Bug's Life". Sure it's got a great cast especially Michael Keaton as Lightning's rival Chick Hick with George Carlin and splendid CGI animation, but it's not quite original like the other works of Pixar cause this movie will remind viewers of the Michael J. Fox movie "Doc Hollywood" with it's similar plot. But luckily this year's "Rataoullie" was a vast improvement on this movie, but i believe "Happy Feet" with the highly underrated "Monster House" did much better then this movie back in 2006 when it comes to unique CGI animated movies.<br /><br />This DVD contains a load of cool extras like two short films, a featurette on how they made the movie and deleted scenes, it is very good but thankfully "Ratatoulie" was better.</p></body></html>

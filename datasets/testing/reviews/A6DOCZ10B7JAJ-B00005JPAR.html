<meta name="summary" content=""Death is a disease.  There is a cure, and I will find it.""></head><body><p>I read the graphic novel extracted from the brilliant mind of Darren Aronofsky, who previously directed Pi, Requiem for a Dream.  He mentioned how The Fountain almost never made it to the big screen because it was a big budget project that lacked mass public appeal.  I know I was flabbergasted when this artistic masterpiece was pulled from my local theater after one week.  Alas, I had to wait for the DVD, but was glad it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />This is a romantic sci-fi journey that explores the existential constraints of the human spirit.  The story orbits around the present day, stretching ostensibly into the past and the future.  It floats around through time and space, spreading throughout the millenium that engulfs us.<br /><br />It involves three seperate stories from three different eras.  Each adventure is connected by the same character, Hugh Jackman, in which his bodily form apparently is reincarnated.<br /><br />In each tale the protagonist is obssessd with the pursuit of immortality.  Each quest is geared toward the "Tree of Life" from the Garden of Eden.  Jackman plays a 16th century conquistador, a present day cancer researcher, and a 26th century astronaut.<br /><br />This movie is imbued with all sorts of dazzling, imaginative special effects that give it quite a surreal feel.  It's both intellectual and emotional.  It raises a glaring question about our humanity, which seems to be defined both by our life and especially our death.  If death is taken out of the equation, would we lose our humanity?<br /><br />Parts of this movie can be confusing and hard to follow.  But I have an interpretation that makes sense to me, although it might not be what is intended.  I view the entire movie as if it takes place in the present day, and the leaps backward and foward in time are merely the imaginary story that the ailing wife(Rachel Weisz)is writing as she is dying from cancer.  I really like that idea, but I might be way off.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a beautiful movie, strongly reccommended if you're looking for something different.</p></body></html>

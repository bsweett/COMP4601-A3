Same thing over and over again, such as, numerous headshots and feasting scenes. I respect George A. Romero and his films, but enough already with zombie flicks. Now as far as these "Dead" flicks go I would rank this one right at the top with Dawn of the Dead. I enjoyed the excess gore, the solid acting, and the great zombie makeup. I didn't really have much to complain about other than the fact that all these zombie films seem alike. Worth seeing if your a fan of the genre or want to see how the only person qualified to make a zombie picture still has the stuff when it comes to the genre he created with Night of the Living Dead.</p></body></html>

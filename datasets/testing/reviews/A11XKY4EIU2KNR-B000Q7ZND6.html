I just find him annoying.<br /><br />Well this flick is about angels and devils and how neither can enter our world but can only 'whisper in our ears'. Well Keanu attempted suicide as a boy, went to hell for two minutes and then came back to life. Now supposedly he's doomed to hell because suicide is a cardinal sin in the Catholic Church. So no matter what he does in his life he's going to hell. You will hear this no less than 20 times in the movie. So he's trying to buy his way into heaven by sending demons back to hell through exorcisms.<br /><br />Well we get a lot of explanations like how the Bible in hell tells a different story in Revelations. You got Satan's son being born, Gabriel trying to kill it, demons made of flies and snakes, and a voodoo witch doctor bar owner who stays neutral.<br /><br />If I may put forth a little bit of opinion. The dude who played Satan was the worst movie Satan I've ever seen. An old bald man is bad enough, but why was he dressed in a white? Like a heavenly white? I wasn't expecting horns, a pitchfork, and a red suit, but this is supposed to be Satan for crying out loud. With the money they spent on special effects, they could have at least delivered a frightening Satan. His demons were fifty times scarier than the Prince of Darkness himself.<br /><br />Well in a nutshell, Keanu still can't act and special effects carried the movie.</p></body></html>

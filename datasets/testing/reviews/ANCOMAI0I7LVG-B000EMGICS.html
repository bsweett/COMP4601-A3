<meta name="summary" content="Lukewarm sentiments about a movie void of all charm..."></head><body><p>Aside from the black smudge that is Kevin Costner (who actually doesn't turn in an awful performance in this dud of a film), I expected a lot from the cast here.  I mean, we're talking about screen goddess Shirley MacLaine (I worship her), underrated supporting player Mark Ruffalo and America's Sweetheart Jennifer Aniston (you know, before we knew that Rachel Greene was the only character she knew how to play).  Anyways, this embellished fable that rests on the cuffs of a GREAT movie (`The Graduate') serves up an interesting concept with absolutely no real effort made to flesh out something remotely interesting.  `The Graduate' was sharp and witty and poignant and, believe it or not, charming.  This film NEEDED charm to sell its prose, and you would think that Aniston especially would bring huge heaps of it.  Instead, she delivers a dull and uninspired variation of her television persona.  MacLaine is a scene stealer (we all knew that) but there isn't much to steal here.  There are few films that meander on stagnancy quite like `Rumor Has It...' but this is one of those rare films that elicits almost no emotional response from me.  I can't say that I hate it, that I love it, that I like it, that I dislike it.  It barely even registers with me because it simply offers nothing.</p></body></html>

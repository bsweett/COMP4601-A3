<meta name="summary" content="When Denny Met Terry..."></head><body><p>Terry (Allen) is in a bit of a pickle...you see her husband has left her without a word for his Swedish secretary and now she has to raise her four daughters on her own.  They all hate her at various stages of the film and she can't seem to forgive herself for driving her husband away nor forgive him for leaving.  And then Denny (Costner), the former baseball player, current discjockey, always drunk next door neighbor trys to help by forcebly becoming Terry's drinking buddy.  Their relationship grows, there bond and his bond with her daughters strengthens as they learn together the truth of her husbands sudden departure.  The acting is wonderful here on the part of Allen and Costner and thats really what carries this simple plot from being slightly entertaining to wonderfully made and a very rewatchable film.  Sometimes we don't give ourselves the opertunity to greive like we should...we bottle up out anger instead of properly displacing it and we end up hurting the ones we love because we have to let it out somehow and it usually comes out wrong.  Allen, who should be up for an oscar here, may not make it to the final race but she will always remain to me the dark horse that should have made it.  Costner is a comedic turn I never knew he could pull resinates with laughter and lightheartedness that gives him a cute, playfull puppy essence about him here and just makes you want to pinch his cheaks.  Supporting actor maybe...not gonna happen, but it should.</p></body></html>

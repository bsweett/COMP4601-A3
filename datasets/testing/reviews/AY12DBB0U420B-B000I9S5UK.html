<meta name="summary" content="A Lousy Movie With Little To Offer."></head><body><p>Well, tonight's bargain rack movie was "Assault on Precinct 13." The movie was difficult for me to understand. The dialogue was in the F-bomb dialect of the English language (that's where the F-word is used as a noun, verb, adjective and adverb, sometimes all in the same sentence, plus F-bombs were liberally dropped just as all-purpose expletives and ersatz punctuation marks) such that those of us not so well versed in that particular dialect should have been offered subtitles to help us comprehend the movie. I've often noticed that when this particular language problem occurs, the movie itself doesn't seem to have much to offer and I've thought that perhaps the language barrier might be interfering with my understanding.<br /><br />In any case,  the cast and the plot were also a bit confusing. There were a lot of good guys (cops) and some bad guys (criminals), at least in the beginning. Well, some of the good guys had to take the bad guys to a prison on a bleak snowy night and they couldn't make it because of the storm so they holed up in an old police station known as Precinct 13 to spend the night and wait for the end of the storm. One of the bad guys being transported was really, really bad and was referred to as Bishop. Well, then the precinct suddenly came under assault by a platoon of good guys (cops) who were really actually bad guys (yes, cops) and the bad good guys were trying to get the really bad guy away from the good good guys because he had the goods on them, or something like that. Anyway, it was the good cops (plus the original bad guys who were converted to good guys to help withstand the assault ) against the bad cops (originally good guys) in a fight to the finish and the casualty rate on both sides was very high, not to mention the property damage. Well, I've probably got this all screwed up, but it really doesn't matter. Let's just say it was a lousy movie with little to offer except a lot of bad language and violence..<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

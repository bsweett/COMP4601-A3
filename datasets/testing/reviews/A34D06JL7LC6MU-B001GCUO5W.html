<meta name="summary" content="The First Great Film of 2010"></head><body><p>Shutter Island marks the fourth collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film is Scorsese's follow-up to his Best Picture-winning The Departed and is adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, whose novel Mystic River was the basis for the terrific Clint Eastwood film. Shutter Island is a different breed of film from both that film and previous Scorsese films. As a director who has been working since the 1960s, you wouldn't expect him to have anything new to offer as a filmmaker, and you would be wrong. Shutter Island is a psychological horror film with shades of similarities to films like Secret Window and The Game (story-wise; specifically in the conclusion), but it's the way Scorsese handles the material rather than the material itself that makes it as good as it is. Shutter Island has beautiful cinematography, lovely art direction, and a haunting score...It's not the story that stays with you as much as the atmosphere.<br /><br />DiCaprio (who is in every scene) plays Edward "Teddy" Daniels, a U.S. Marshal from Boston circa 1954, who is sent to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a patient at Shutter Island's asylum for the criminally insane. With his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) in tow, Teddy is immediately baffled by the woman's disappearance and suspicious of the ominous doctors (Ben Kingsley & Max Von Sydow) who run the asylum. Haunted by dreams of his dead wife (Michelle Williams) and his time in the war; Teddy slowly unravels the mystery housed at Shutter Island with shocking, albeit semi-predictable results.<br /><br />I've compared the film to Secret Window and The Game, but this comparison is a reflection of various parts of the plot. As a film, it's much more reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and Lars von Trier's Antichrist sans the sexual mutilation. The cinematography led me to specifically recall Antichrist as both films share a similar artful quality and creativity in the area. There are scenes in Shutter Island that are breathtakingly beautiful, some even capturing that beauty in the grotesque and horrifying. As for the comparison to The Shining, Scorsese has made a film that is so atmospheric, it draws you into both the setting and the mystery of the film in the way The Shining did. To say this film evokes Kubrick is an understatement; it's the closest thing I've seen to a Kubrick film since Kubrick died and I doubt Scorsese would deny that influence.<br /><br />As you could expect from a Scorsese film, it's filled with terrific actors giving terrific performances but it's DiCaprio who carries the film. DiCaprio is a misunderstood actor, equally loved and hated by moviegoers/critics. Some think he's wooden, incapable of evoking any real emotion while some see him as one of the greatest working actors. This performance should sway some of his naysayers, as DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Teddy. This is a complicated character, with many dimensions to him and DiCaprio embodies those dimensions perfectly with plenty of nuance. The supporting players are all perfectly cast as well, sometimes making quite an impression with only a single scene, such as the terrific Jackie Earle Haley.<br /><br />Certainly some will find it slow-moving (although at 138 minutes, it never feels long) and even more will see the long-winded ending as a bit of a cop out. I wasn't disappointed by the ending due to the inclusion of the haunting scene at the Lake House and Scorsese leaving his audience with just a little bit of ambiguity. This is a terrific film Scorsese has made here. It's a horror film of the sort that isn't made anymore; an intelligent horror film for intelligent people. It's the first great film of 2010, proof that DiCaprio and Scorsese bring out something special and powerful in each other. Its imagery and memorable musical score only get richer with a second viewing. Don't miss this film.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

He only came alive briefly when he sneaked behind enemy lines to cut the gas lines of the Del Fuego's motorcycles, causing their hang out to go up in flames. Sorry if I spoiled the suspense.<br /><br />I never saw it, but I heard that he made a movie based on the science fiction writing of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, that could be worse than The Wild Hogs, but it is hard to imagine how. Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000. I gave The Wild Hogs 2 stars, just in case this other Travolta vehicle is actually worse. A 1 star film has to be like, Plan 9 From Outer Space.<br /><br />Travolta was great in Pulp Fiction. Saturday Night Fever, even. Urban Cowboy? All right, I suppose. He was good as Vinnie Barbarino on Welcome Back, Kotter--though constantly overshadowed by the scene stealing Horshak. He might have even been good in the film version of the musical version of the film Hairspray. Though I doubt he topped the divine performance of Divine, even with the help of co-star Christopher (More Cowbell!!!!) Walken. But in a lame movie like The Wild Hogs, Travolta really stuck out as the lamest of the lame.<br /><br />I would say that Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence were at a slightly higher level of acting then they displayed in their sit coms, Home Improvement and Martin. That is appropriate for this kind of movie, so they did their jobs adequately. William H. Macy is, according to several women who offered their opinons unsolicited, one of the least attractive men to ever trod planet Earth. I guess when he gets the girl, we should all be cheering him on. The woman he falls for was really the best actor, ever, just to make you believe that she liked him. Ray Liotta makes for a scary villain. Cameo by Peter Fonda--good to see him. He hasn't done much since Easy Rider. Jack Nicholson has eclipsed him ten fold, and even Dennis Hopper has done more since Easy Rider. The woman who plays Chris Rock's mom on Everybody Hates Chris played Martin Lawrence's wife. I like her, but this stupid film wasted her talent.<br /><br />I was just reading about the Oscars, and how the films that get the awards usually aren't the ones that do well at the Box Office. With few exceptions, like Titanic, they rarely overlap. Of this year's nominees for best picture, Juno actually did the best at the box office. It's pro life theme played well in the Midwest, and it built an audience by good word-of-mouth. It was maybe 23rd or 27th. But The Wild Hogs ranked 13th or 15th at the box office. Still, I don't care. It was extremely lame. It won't win any Oscars and the critics will pan it. I am sad that a movie as lame as this would actually earn any money whatsoever.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSY">Easy Rider</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767818172">The Wild One</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558908242">Pulp Fiction</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSP6K">Welcome Back, Kotter</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXCH">Saturday Night Fever</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXIV">Battlefield Earth</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001EFV7C">The Cooler</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJZ6">Boogie Nights</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792846427">Fargo</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RZ9Y">Hairspray</a></p></body></html>

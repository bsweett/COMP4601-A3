<meta name="summary" content="A Feel-Good Musical"></head><body><p>This is a 2-disc special edition starring Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, extremely talented veteran actors who have starred in many many movies.  I grew up watching musicals, so it was refreshing to see one today.  Although the plot is a tad weak, and many of the songs are not exactly Rogers and Hammerstein, there are good musical numbers throughout the movie with lots of singing and dancing.  Much (or maybe all?) of the music is Abba. I guess I would say that some of the music is great and some is just ok.  Pierce Brosnan (bless his little heart) sings 3 songs.  Now, he is not exactly Mario Lanza but his numbers add to the overall production (and I'll leave it at that.) EVERYBODY sings in this musical, which is great.<br /><br />The movie opens (and continues) with beautiful scenery.  A wee bit of the film (in the beginning) was filmed in London, but most of the production was filmed in Greece, on 2 small islands and on the mainland (Skopelos, Skiathos, and Mouresi-Magnesia).  Raised on the Greek island of Kalokairi by her unmarried mom Donna (Meryl), beautiful and delicate 20-year old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) explains to her girlfriends, Lisa and Ali, how she has always felt "empty" not knowing who her father is. She got her little paws on Donna's diary, and in reading the exciting parts (the "dot, dot, dot" parts), she determines that one of Donna's 3 past boyfriends just HAS to be Daddy.  Let's see--Is it Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Harry (Colin Firth), or Sam (Pierce Brosnan)?<br /><br />Sophie is about to marry Sky (Dominic Cooper), so while Donna is sending out invitations to her best friends, Rosie, the stuff-your-vegetables cookbook writer (Julie Walters) and Tanya, the vixen whose 3rd husband paid for her plastic surgery (Christine Baranski), Sophie sends out some invitations too. Sophie invites Bill, Harry, and Sam!  When Sophie signs Donna's name to the invitations, the guys leave their digs and come to Kalokairi for the wedding.  All the time, the guys are wondering why Donna invited them to her daughter's wedding when they haven't heard from Donna in 20 years. Sophie wants her Daddy to give the bride away at the wedding, so she hides the guys in Donna's villa-hotel, but Donna finds them.  Of course, the plot takes off from here but it is pretty simplistic.  There is not a whole lot more that happens.  As i said before, the attention is more on the music. Chick-flick?  Yeah.  I guess it is.<br /><br />Bonus features include a sing-along with on-screen lyrics for 22 musical numbers; a deleted musical number, and a commentary with the director.  Special Edition exclusives are:<br />1) The making of Mamma Mia! the movie;<br />2) Anatomy of a musical number "Lay All Your Love On Me";<br />3) Becoming a Singer;<br />4) Behind the Scenes with Amanda;<br />5) On Location in Greece;<br />6) A Look Inside the Movie;<br />7) "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme" Music Video;<br />8) Bjorn Ulvaues Cameo;<br />9) Deleted Scenes and Outtakes; and<br />10) Digital Copy of the movie (that you can download to your ipod, but you need an internet connection and the password that they give you on the insert).<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars because i kinda averaged it out, which I don't normally do in my reviews.  I gave the storyline a 3, because I thought the plot was much too simplistic, realizing though that the director likely put more attention on the musical part of the production.  I gave the music and dancing a 4, because some of the songs were great and some were just ok,  I gave the gorgeous scenery a 5.  The acting while singing deserved a 4 or 5.  I especially liked the feeling that Meryl put into "The Winner Takes It All" scene during her discussion with Pierce right before the wedding, on a cliff in Greece.<br /><br />I would have liked to hear a little Greek music here and there, since they were in Greece (Duh!).  I think I only heard one Greek word in the whole movie (Duh--again). A little unrealistic. But, there was a lot n of singing and dancing, some great numbers, great choreography, many great songs, and sometimes large numbers of townspeople joining in the productions.  I found myself laughing out loud a few times and it was a real feel-good movie--very entertaining. I did enjoy it and would watch it again.  The bonus features were also entertaining.<br /><br />Just DON'T make the same mistake I did!  I watched this movie right before bedtime, so I heard "Dancing Queen" in my head ALL NIGHT LONG!!!</p></body></html>

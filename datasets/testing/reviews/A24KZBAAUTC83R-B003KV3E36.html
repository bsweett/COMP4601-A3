<meta name="summary" content="Rock'em Sock'em Rambo!"></head><body><p>For those who probably laughed at the idea of a new Rambo movie coming out, thinking Stallone is either too old or would return old school-like Rambo - think again!!<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone took triple jobs of Writing, acting, and directing the up-to-date all-out action extravaganza action movie of the year.<br /><br />We only gave it 4 stars because it was too short.<br /><br />The action sequences were some of the most realistic since Saving Private Ryan. Stallone actually uses his brainpan to have Rambo actually age gracefully, but still does the smart thing and aligns his Rambo with a group of mercenaries to help him out, instead of doing the past 'do everything yourself' action flick. Intelligent move.<br /><br />This is most definately the best Stallone acted and directed movie -ever! And his last Rocky movie was well done and well acted, but lacked somewhat of the explosive stuff that the first 4 had. But it still managed to grip your heart.<br /><br />Rambo rocks, and we really hope that Stallone keeps showcasing his still intact acting and directing acumen. Now that Stallone has finally returned in full force, with both a Rocky and Rambo one-two success, the word is that some smart producers gave Stallone the greenlight to create more Rambo action/adventure films.<br /><br />Can't wait to see this. Rocky ended with a solid movie. Stallone will hopefully end it on a good note, but continue John Rambo's adventures. Hopefully, Rambo will finally find someone to love, and a home to rest in.<br />(Of course this is after a bloody full-out action/adventure romp through Hell!)<br /><br />That would be the ultimate ending to the Rambo franchise.<br /><br />We will definately buy this upcoming HD DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A solid telling of an intruiging true story"></head><body><p>This truly is a story about going into the wild.  First of all, cast off all of the things you don't need, then work along here and there, pick up what you need to survive in the wild, and then go there...and live.<br /><br />This isn't a "My Side of the Mountain" type of sanitized storyline. It's about an inexperienced young man that knows how to work and knows how to learn, going into the wild alone, finding food, and surviving (or not- you have to see the movie to find out).<br /><br />This is not a show for the younger crowd.  Don't expect high dollar special effects, just a thoughtful, intelligent telling of a true story.<br /><br />4 solid stars</p></body></html>

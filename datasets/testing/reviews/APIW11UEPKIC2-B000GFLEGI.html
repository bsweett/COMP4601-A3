<meta name="summary" content="I haven't seen the director's cut, but the movie I saw left me no reason to ever watch it again"></head><body><p>Don't get me wrong, I really wanted to like this, but it didn't even seem like a movie.  It just seemed like a couple of good actors came together with a bunch of what seemed to be brand new actors and had someone role a camera while they were practicing their lines.<br /><br />So the movie starts out with these cops driving around in an armored bus with guns and stuff on it.  They go around killing zombies.  I really don't know what else to say.  Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and I wish I could say he was the best part of the movie, but everyone was too horible to say that they helped the movie at all.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a movie that makes no sense, has no character development, but does have some really good gore, then you should check this out.<br /><br />And at the end of this, am I supposed to believe that the head zombie guy just became smart all of a sudden and figured out how to blow stuff up?</p></body></html>

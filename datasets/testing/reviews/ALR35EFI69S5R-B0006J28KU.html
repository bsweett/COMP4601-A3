<meta name="summary" content="Great Cops And Robbers Spectacular!"></head><body><p>Few movies from the 1990s have the energy, action sequences, or provocative depictions of men who are bigger than life than does this gorgeously photographed and brilliantly choreographed cops and robbers tale starring Robert DeNiro as a supremely competent heist-meister and Al Pacino as his indefatigable pursuer. The film, which opens with a robbery sequence involving an armored truck and a precision team that takes it down so professionally it makes one's head spin, has so much action and so much going on it sometimes skips into overdrive. Yet it is all done with such an entertaining verve that one stays with all that is happening as it floats from one situation to another. <p>There are a number of subplots, each involving one of the principles in elements of his personal life. But whether it be DeNiro trying to come to terms with a woman who offers him a chance at a more meaningful and satisfying life, or Val Kilmer trying to figure out how to deal with his high-maintenance life style and a wife with a roving eye (played wonderfully by Ashley Judd), or Pacino trying to essay his way through the wilderness of his own conflictions and how they affect his relationship with his wife, we see these as entertaining sidebars and not the main show, which is the inevitable showdown between DeNiro and Pacino.  <p>This is several movies in one; a wonderfully entertaining shoot-em-up action film, with more than enough pyrotechnics to satisfying the most demanding of fans; an absorbing character study of both DeNiro's and Pacino's contrasting characters and the ways in which they are very similar and at the same time very much different; and a morality play, in which we watch as DeNiro's figure has to make the choice between a life affirming and a life-extinguishing decision, one that then profoundly affects his own fate. This is a great movie, and one that confirms the fact that neither DeNiro nor Pacino have lost the magic touch; both are terrific here. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

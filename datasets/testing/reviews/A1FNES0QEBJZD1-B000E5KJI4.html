<meta name="summary" content="Troy: The Directors Cut on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>The over 30 minutes of additional footage greatly enhance the theatrical release of this thoroughly interesting and exciting film.  One of Brad Pitts best films, and highly underrated, the video transfer is very good, sharp and detailed though out with no grain or video noise that I could detect.  The audio however, really could have used a more detailed mix into discreet channels as there is certainly enough action both in front and behind the viewer that a more thorough use of the rear channels would have been beneficial.  The additional footage is not just gratuitous cut scenes but actually do go further to enhance the story lines and create depth to the characters.  That the director himself states that this longer version is what he had initially envisioned adds to its validity.<br /><br />Though the story is not completely historically accurate according to the works of Homer, it never the less, is great watching.  You do get absorbed by the film and that is what entertainment is about.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

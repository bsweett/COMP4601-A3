<meta name="summary" content="A Megadose of Jack Black"></head><body><p>If you love Jack Black, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, probably not so much, as it relies heavily on large doses of Black in the starring role as a grimacing, hyperkinetic ruffian bent on turning a bunch of fifth graders into punkish rockers.  Joan Cusack lends just the right amount of support as the uptight principal of the stuffy private school where Black's subversive activities take place. It's all great fun in a PG sort of way, but you really have to work hard at suspending disbelief most of the time. Thumbs up, but not WAY up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="part of the gang of epics"></head><body><p>Like Gladiator and Braveheart, this one's to be loved for its sweeping epic scenes, stunning landscapes, solid cinematography and a few stand out performances - namely Lewis.'<p>A dark mood is effectively captured as is a real sense of the adventure and danger of settling this country. Suspending some critical judgment is always good with pictures like this. Simply go with it and get swept up in its grandeur.<p>For me that is the real magic of film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Frank Darabont May Very Well be the next Spielberg"></head><body><p>Even though his two most successful movies have been adaptions of Stephen King prison novels.  However, Darabonts' storytelling has raised those two movies, including "The Green Mile," above the usual mediocre King adapted movies and into the realm of greatness.  His touch behind the camera is impeccable, and he moves the story at an unforced pace to illustrate its themes and deftly paints its characters.  He also has an uncanny ability to choose brilliant casts, as he does here.  He brings in Tom Hanks, the most reliable actor in Hollywood to play the lead as Paul Edgecombe, and Michael Clark-Duncan as the walking miracle John Coffey. He also brings in David Morse as Brutus, James Cromwell as the Warden, Michael Jeter as Eduard Delacroix, Sam Rockwell as Wild Bill and Doug Hutchinson at his best as Percy.<p>Paul Edgecombe is a prison guard during the Depression, and into his midst comes a mammoth inmate named John Coffey, who was wrongly convicted of the rape and murder of two little girls.  But he is a gentle soul, and Paul and his fellow guards have a hard time comprehending that this man could have killed two little girls at all.  Over time, Coffey reveals his extraordinary gift:  He is a healer, some sort of a miracle worker, able to cure any ailment or disease.  He does so at first, by curing Paul's urinary infection.  But one fact keeps bothering the guards, Paul most of all:  should this miracle be executed or, more importantly, is he possibly innocent.  Darabont's script and direction keeps everything tight as it moves towards the emotionally wrenching and draining ending, one that leaves you tearless because you have spent them all.<p>Everything in the "Green Mile" is laudable, right down to the gritty set decoration and perfectly crafted period-set costumes and locales.  Frank Darabont crafted a masterpiece with the "Green Mile" one that can stand up to his other work of brilliance, "The Shawshank Redemption."  The story is so well told and the acting so unforced and natural, it's disappointing that they don't make that many movies like it anymore.</p></body></html>

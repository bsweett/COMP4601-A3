Abrams, 113 minutes, 2011) - Every now and then comes a film that is so much fun, so compelling, suspenseful, moving and well acted that you do not care how dumb and derivative it may be. SUPER 8 is not just your ordinary alien-monster-devours-a-town film. This has nostalgia, heart, Oscar-caliber acting and a director who has inherited the Flame from Spielberg.<br /><br />Charming, sweet young Joe Lamb (15-year-old Joel Courtney in his first major role) has lost his mother in an accident. It is circa 1979, in the hamlet of Lillian, Ohio (West Virginia served as the location). To alleviate the pain, he and his pals assist their pushy fellow junior high student in the making of a Super 8 zombie film. Witnessing a train accident at their prime location, the kids barely escape with their lives - not knowing what the wreck has unleashed. The train wreck has to be one of the most spectacular sequences ever filmed.<br /><br />Joe and his friends will discover much about extraterrestrial life before their week is finished - and it is here the film is at its most powerful. The kids are dead set on finishing their Super 8 film in time to submit it to an Ohio film contest. Having shot similar stuff in the mid-1970s, I can tell you: nothing stops a filmmaking obsession. Not even a giant, slimy alien.<br /><br />Although the attempts to get the kids talking right was a bit of a failure (kids did not say "totally, dude" in the 1970s, and this is just the tip of the anachronisms iceberg) - and the story certainly could have ended a bit better - it was all worth it. Abrams, while not slapping or shimmying the camera so much, is in full force with his trademark deliberate camera flare. It adds to the atmosphere, as does the rich cinematography and the location of a little old town.<br /><br />This is the first film I know of attempting to show us the elite cadre of budding filmmaking kids in the 1970s, and the Super 8 film festival culture. Spielberg, though he's approximately a fellow of my generation, filmed the same kinds of zombie flicks as a kid. Abrams pays deep homage to Spielberg; the pity about Spielberg not directing is that this might have been seen as a major comeback for him as a director. Oh well.<br /><br />Don't miss the kids' finished, hilarious Super 8 film, "The Case", which is shown in all its glory during the final credit roll. This goofy, 1950s-style monster flick is just the tonic we need in this frazzled era. My only wish is Abrams and Spielberg will keep up the good work.<br /><br />Featuring the talents of Noah Emmerich, Kyle Chandler, Ron Eldard, the sweet soon-to-be-a-superstar Elle Fanning (her sister Dakota had a split-second cameo as did Abrams) and Glynn Turman as Dr. Woodward.</p></body></html>

First panned upon its 1983 release, like it's predecessor and namesake SCARFACE has become a part of the American cultural consciousness far beyond itself.<br /><br />Pacino plays Marielito Tony Montana, a small-time stickup artist in Castro's Cuba who becomes a major drug kingpin in 1980s Miami. Pacino's Montana is reminiscent both of Muni's character and of his own portrayal of Michael Corleone. In Montana, Pacino shows us the twisted inner workings of the criminal personality he presented so convincingly as THE GODFATHER.<br /><br />Pacino gives us an intentionally over-the-top performance, using a theatrically "theek" Cuban accent and unremitting obscenities (estimated as one every thirty eight seconds on average) as the foundation stones for Tony Montana. Much of Pacino's characterization depends on black comedy (Tony's beloved bright yellow Cadillac with the tiger stripe interior is ridiculous to the point of screaming laughter, as is his bloodthirsty earnest buffoonery---after killing two men in cold blood he casually offers his third intended victim a job: "Okay! You call me tomorrow!") Pacino's humor hits its high point when he mutters miserably, "I don't trust Mob guys," while lighting a Corona in unconscious flattery of Vito Corleone. Scarface is very intentionally the id of the more calculating Don Michael.<br /><br />DePalma, through scriptwriter Oliver Stone, manages to penetrate to the heart of darkness of the cocaine subculture. Surrounded by metric tons of cocaine, warehouses full of money, and all the trash it can buy, Montana values only three people in the world, his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and his friends Angel and Manolo (Steven Bauer), one of whom he kills himself and two of whom die through his indirect machinations.<br /><br />When Angel dies in a gruesome chainsaw scene as brilliantly conceived and executed as Janet Leigh's shower scene in PSYCHO, a classic of directorial misdirection, Tony's humanity all but dies, and he rampages through Miami's drug underworld, butchering his rival, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), stealing Lopez's vicious, sexy llello-emaciated wife, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), and burying himself alive in a lust of grotesque materialism. For just a moment the world is his.<br /><br />Pacino captures Montana's colorful rise and his robotic downfall perfectly, showing us that Tony Montana is a spiritually dead character.  Although he fights to protect Gina and idolizes her throughout the film, his lifestyle of excess eventually claims her, as unable to grasp the thought of love as opposed to sheer possession, Tony kills Manolo when he discovers them together. (The two had secretly married and planned to surprise Tony).<br /><br />DePalma also uses the tropical motifs of Miami in a subtle way to mark Tony Montana's rise and fall. Starting out as a wisecracking second-story man addicted to Hawaiian shirts and jeans he later graduates to neon technopop polyester leisure suits in pastel colors and then finally to dark black pinstripes. The further he descends into evil the more conservative and less bright he appears.<br /><br />Pacino's Montana ends his depraved existence with his face buried in a mound of cocaine, and firing a grenade rifle at men come to kill him for botching an assassination---ironically, Tony is to die for not killing the children of an important politician. In the end, this flicker of compassion can't redeem him.<br /><br />The Special Edition second disc has some fascinating material comparing and contrasting the two SCARFACEs, and exploring much of the underpinning of this gangster classic. One of the more interesting segments is a hip-hop exploration of the film, which has become a kind of bible for 'gangsta' rappers. To see Tony Montana lauded as "a man of principle," "loyal to his friends" and a man who "has it all" is an incredible expose of the mindset of the rap contributors to the segment, since Tony Montana is none of the above, except in the most meaningless of ways.<br /><br />Although SCARFACE has its uneven moments and Tony's rise is far more fascinating than his inevitable fall, this movie is far better than its initial weak press reviews indicated. SCARFACE is a true classic and time-capsule piece of the Miami drug scene. Once again, Al Pacino is being, not acting onscreen, and the results are nothing short of amazing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Violence without blood; nudity without sex; what kind of movie is this?"></head><body><p>Of all the movies about deranged killers, this is probably the most intriguing one yet produced.  Set in post-Napoleanic France, the story follows the tragic life of a man, Jean, from birth to death, and how his scent of smell leads him to do ghoulish deeds.  You see, Jean has the world's most acute sense of smell, both in terms of sensitiveness, and ability to distinguish two smells that are almost identical.  Growing up in an orphanage, his ability sets him apart from the others.  He finally escapes and discovers the smell of women; specifically attractive virgin women.  This sets him on his goal of creating the perfect perfume, one made out of the scent of virgin women.<br /><br />How does one classify this movie?  It has scenes of suspense, but these are few and far between.  There is comedy, but it is black comedy that is grim.  There is murder, but no blood or gore of any sort.  And there are numerous scenes of attractive, naked women; but our protagonist only rubs their smells from their bodies without ever taking advantage of them.  It is best classified as a drama; one meant for adults only.  The story is very original, probably the most original story of any film released in 2006, even though it is based on a book.  The two main supporting actors are the only famous names in the cast; Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman.  Everyone else, including the numerous beautiful women are Hollywood unknowns.  All in all, a good movie to watch.</p></body></html>

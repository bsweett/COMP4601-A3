<meta name="summary" content="One of the years best the acting is excellent from everyone"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this film from start to finish. The story is a drama so there is no action or nothing but that's good. It's a haunting love story that will get you hooked and will not let you go. The acting is excellent and every actor gives oscar worthy performances the acting is the best I ahve seen in a long time. The score is great for the filma nd the scienry is great especially for some on who ahs seen where they film (in jasper/banff albert). Overall I would dnot say it's the best film of 2005 but it's up there as being one of the best films of the year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Off-color, Irreverent  Hilarity"></head><body><p>I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></body></html>

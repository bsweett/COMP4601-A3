He is one of the great American directors, and on top of that, the man really loves film as an art form.  As a result, it's particularly disappointing when a Scorsese film misses the mark.<br /><br />This movie tried so hard to be an epic that it failed in the most basic departments of story and characterization.  The enormous sets, the costuming, the size of the crowds--all of it screams "hey, I'm an epic!"  But ultimately this movie is a collection of trappings of an epic film badly stitched together into something much less than the sum of its parts.  For the three solid hours that we spend with the characters, we never know any of them (other than Bill Cutting) very well, nor does a coherent plot ever coalesce.  And although the performances are generally quite good, neither DeCaprio nor Bill the Butcher ever quite figure out what accent they want to use and stick with it.  Indeed, about every third line of Bill's sounds like Fat Tony from the Simpsons, and the others sound like standard American English.  And what was up with the ending?  Both anticlimactic and somewhat baffling, it makes the viewer wonder why he just sat through three hours of film.<br /><br />If this movie had been about an hour shorter and focused more on substance than style, it would have been a real winner.  As is, this is best rented, and only if you have 3 hours of time on your hands for something that you probably won't like very much.</p></body></html>

Long, convoluted action scenes, a jumbled mythology weighing everything down.  Heavy helpings of CGI and stock plots.  Excess ruined THE MATRIX trilogy and it also nearly sunk the Pirates.<br /><br />There was a decent balance of the thin characters in the first movie but more of these people are definitely less.  Does anyone really care about Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's lovers?  In the sequels, they both appear to be doing nothing but posing and defiantly jutting their jaws at the never-ending battles.<br /><br />Yes, there's action and special effects and fighting and swordplay and cannons...but eventually it's just noise.</p></body></html>

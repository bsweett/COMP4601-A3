<meta name="summary" content="A vampire movie that's more emotional than scary"></head><body><p>Wow.  Someone's actually managed to make an original vampire movie.  I'm not a big fan of vampire stories, I've just seen it too many times.  But this as good as it gets.  Beautifully shot (and great looking on blu-ray), moody, mysterious, emotional.  This is as much a pre-adolescent love story, as anything.<br /><br />An outsider boy, fragile, picked on, and harboring violent fantasies of revenge is befriended by a strange, pale young girl who doesn't<br />seem to feel the Swedish cold.<br /><br />It's a strange and fascinating mix of tones; bloody, gory killings, very sweet, well acted pre-teen romance, and occasional black comedy.  There's also an interesting, complex morality here.  Both our young heroes have deeply violent, sadistic streaks within them.  Yet we root for them, even though some off her victims are truly innocent, and he collects stories about murder like a nascent serial killer.  It grew even deeper emotionally on 2nd viewing.</p></body></html>

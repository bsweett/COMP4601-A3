<meta name="summary" content="Biel and Norton cannot save this"></head><body><p>Just stop what you are doing<br />Just stop considering this movie<br />Go watch The Prestige instead<br />It is so much better<br />but if you like Biel because she is hot<br />then by all means salivate away<br />the same goes for Norton<br />although I do not know why he was in this film, it is below his acting standards<br />Then again he was talking to himself and Brad Pitt in the horrible movie Fight club.  What a bar of soap that was.  Yeah nothing to see here move along now people!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bloated (and unnecessary) Director's Cut fails to dim JFK's brilliance"></head><body><p>There are other, more full-featured releases to choose from, but don't bother. After almost three and a half hours of viewing, the only thing you'll want is time to savor and digest. In any case, the subject disc includes a commentary track from Director Oliver Stone. (Excellent and engaging, by the way.) Please note that like so many studio re-releases, the original theatrical release is *not* included here. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNOX94">The Natural</a> was another offensive example of studio double-dippage.) The extra 17 minutes included in the JFK Director's Cut is mainly comprised of two scenes which in my opinion only slow the narrative. Your mileage may vary. The original film made such an impact (some of the scenes entered the public consciousness almost immediately: "Back and to the left") and was so meticulously assembled (JFK won the Oscar for Film Editing) that a Director's Cut is unnecessary. Unfortunately and as far as I know, the theatrical release was never available here in the USA in DVD format. The more expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000542DJ">2-disc set</a> includes several featurettes and is commensurately more expensive.<br /><br />The film speaks for itself, or at least it will, after you've watched it a few times. Well-paced John Williams score and an all-star cast, many actors willing to make small roles memorable. Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, Sissy Spacek, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, Martin Sheen, John Candy, Brian Doyle-Murray, Michael Rooker, Jay O. Sanders, Vincent D'Onofrio.<br /><br />Those interested in political assassination thrillers should also see 1973's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226853">The Day of the Jackal</a>.</p></body></html>

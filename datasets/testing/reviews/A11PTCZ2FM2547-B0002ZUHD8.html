<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating Look at the Origins of a Legend"></head><body><p>We as a culture tend to become so enamored with The Legend of King Arthur that we lose sight of one crucial word:  Legend.  First penned a thousand years after the real King Arthur supposedly lived, the legend--with its sweeping depictions of Camelot, wizards, the Lady of the Lake, a forbidden love--has transcended reality.  So, when a new interpretation of Arthur is presented that has none of the above, it's a bit jarring, and forces the viewer into somewhat of a discomfort zone.  Which, to me, is the beauty of Jerry Bruckheimer's new epic, KING ARTHUR, a handsome film that usurps the legend to tell the story of a man who was able to unite an island under siege.<p>The producers of this film make the case that the original Arthur was a Sarmatian warrior with an allegiance for Rome, a man by the name of Lucius Artorius Castus.  In the sixth century, as Rome was preparing to abandon the Isle of Briton and leave its native tribes defenseless against the invading Saxons, Artorius--also known as Arthur--is given one more task to perform before Rome will grant him and his knights freedom from military service:  rescue a Roman noble family trapped behind Saxon lines.  The quest is daunting--almost suicidal--yet the prospect of freedom is alluring to a group of seven knights weary of battle, even though they are uncertain what to do once freedom is obtained (go back to their ancestral homeland, or remain in Briton?).  The subsequent story is riveting, as Arthur and his dwindling band of knights forge an uneasy alliance with the native Woads (led by Merlin and Guinevere) to take on the ruthless and bloodthirsty Saxons.  <p>Clive Owen is believable and sincere in the title role; the supporting cast, including Ray Winstone, Stellan Skarsgard, and Ioan Gruffudd, gives stellar performances.  The four-star rating, unfortunately, has to do with the film's one glaring weakness:  the character Guinevere (Keira Knightly).  Depicting this character as a scantily-clad, green-painted, fierce Xena clone is absolutely laughable, and seriously undermined the credibility of the rest of the story.  Yet this irritant is easily forgiven, based on the overall scope and feel of this epic--an epic that explores the origins of a legend.<br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's not the masterpiece many proclaim it to be, but it is fun and entertaining..."></head><body><p>I know that we are all supposed to love this movie because the critics say it's great but I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed as the credits began to run.  There are some funny sequences and there are some fun moments, and I must admit that when the film opened to young Tracy Turnblad singing good morning to Baltimore I was in movie musical heaven but as the film continued to drag on I felt like they were trying to hard to be the `anti-Dreamgirls'.  Now I love `Dreamgirls', but my main complaint for `Dreamgirls' was that once you take away the singing you have what I like to call `barely a film' left.<br /><br />`Hairspray' tries to remedy that by teaching us the pain and sufferings caused by segregation and trying to show the power one voice can have in making a difference.  I wouldn't say that it failed in this attempt, but it just seemed to get lost at times within its own cause.  I slowed down the fun and brought on the sap in moments that just didn't mesh right with me and what I wanted to see.  In the end it in a way accomplished what it was after but along the way it made me feel kind of awkward, and unexplainable `I should be having fun, right?' kind of awkward.<br /><br />The story, as most of you probably know, is about young Tracy Turnblad, an overweight unpopular girl who dreams of dancing on the Corny Collins show.  She gets her chance when one of the girls drops out for `just nine months' and so she auditions.  The producer Velma von Tussle and her daughter Amber are not impresses with Tracy.  They insult her and send her home.  After one of the stars of the show sees her dancing at school though she is prompted to dance in front of Corny Collins himself and is given a spot on the show.  Tracy becomes an overnight sensation and she inspires many people to invest in their own dreams.<br /><br />Right off the bat my wife and I noticed something I found slightly humorous and I wonder if it was intentional.  Nikki Blonsky (our young star) sounds like a cartoon heroine when she sings, like Ariel in the flesh, while Michelle Pfeiffer (arguably the best thing about this film) sings like a cartoon villain.  It's just a little tidbit I found entertaining.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky performs beautifully.  She's energetic and endearing, just like she needed to be.  In fact I'm impressed with just about everyone onscreen except for the one everyone keeps talking about.  I honestly felt that John Travolta blew this one.  He sounded like a drag queen and just went way over the top.  The best thing that can be said about his performance is that it's fearless.  Sometimes it's good to have a little fear.  Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as Velma von Tussle.  She's sly and dastardly, I just love it.  Christopher Walken is wasted here for he rarely does anything on screen really, which is a shame because he's amazing, and Queen Latifah pretty much reprises her role from `Chicago' just without the `vavavoom' that got her an Oscar nomination the first time around.  Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Elijah Kelley...Taylor Parks...they all do what they need to do and they do it well.  I can see why the girls love little Zac Efron, he is a, oh what do they say, `cutey' and Brittany Snow was just spot on as the devilish Amber von Tussle.  Pfeiffer and Snow made a great team.<br /><br />`Hairspray' sure has its moments of musical bliss, and it has its catastrophes of full fledged corniness so it's up to you to decide how you feel about the film.  Many a critic has lauded this as one of the best films of the year.  I say "no" to that, but it was entertaining to say the least.  It tries really hard to be a great film and succeeds in being a good film so I guess that counts for something.</p></body></html>

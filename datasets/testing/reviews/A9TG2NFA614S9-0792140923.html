<meta name="summary" content="An American Icon"></head><body><p>"Forrest Gump" (1994) is a classic, iconic American movie I think will live on. It's about a generation (about 30 years) from John F. Kennedy through the L.B.J. and Nixon administrations and beyond. Much of the early movie is comic. At the beginning and end of the movie we see Forest waiting and a feather floating through the air: life goes on, the circle of life persists and endures. Forrest, mentally challenged, learns to run like a house afire to get away from his enemies and his demons.<br /> Through a groundbreaking process we see Forrest's image merged with the real images on newsreel footage of the American presidents he meets. He isn't greatly impressed by famous people, fame for himself or money. He's loving, extremely loyal, kind, gentle, na?ve, trusting, courageous, and a lot smarter about life than most of the people around him.<br />Tom Hanks, the quintessential American movie star of the last thirty years, does a fantastic job as Forrest. The movie is full of adages and sayings (like "stupid is as stupid does") that Forrest repeats and lives by. He and his mother (Sally Fields) have a deep connection, and he has one love in his life, his childhood sweetheart, Jennie. She's a sixties love child who deeply disappoints Forrest by becoming part of the 60's and 70's drug culture, but their love triumphs.<br />Because of his ability to outrun everybody, Forest Gump becomes a football star and an accidental hero in the Vietnam War saving Bubba Blue, the shrimp fisherman he's befriended. He also saves Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who eventually becomes his business partner and life-long friend. He goes into Bubba's shrimp business after the Vietnam War, and he becomes successful along with Lieutenant Dan.<br />The movie reaches into pathos, but it can be excused for those excesses. It's a classic. Life just happens to Forrest, everything is accidental, not due to his planning, but he endures as an American icon.</p></body></html>

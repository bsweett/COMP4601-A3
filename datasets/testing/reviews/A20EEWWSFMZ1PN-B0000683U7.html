<meta name="summary" content="Who is George Kaplan?"></head><body><p>This has become a classic Alfred Hitchcock film, with film score by Bernard Herrmann. If the story is not remembered or commented on, everyone is familiar with the scene where Grant is getting attacked by a crop duster while standing in the middle of nowhere "North by Northwest".<br /><br />Roger O. Thornhill &lt;R.O.T> (Cary Grant), mild mannered advertising executive, raises his hand at the wrong time to send a telegram. The page boy is paging George Kaplan so Roger is mistaken for Kaplan (a shorter man with dandruff) and the fun begins. Turns out that Townsend/ Vandamm (James Mason) the bad guy  is being dogged by Kaplan so Vandamm must do away with Kaplan.<br /><br />Meanwhile back at the train Roger meats a cutie Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) that is apparently set on helping him.<br /><br />I will not go into details as surprise and plot twisting is part of the suspense.<br /><br />Will Roger get the girl?<br />Will Vandamm get Roger?<br />What is this all about?<br />Who is George Kaplan?</p></body></html>

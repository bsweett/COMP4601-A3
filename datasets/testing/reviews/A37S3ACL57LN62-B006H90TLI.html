He kills without mercy for seemingly no reason at all other than he enjoys this pastime. An innocent man named Lynn (Josh Brolin) gets mixed up in his twisted pleasures when he accidentally comes across a large murder scene. There are dead men and bullet holes everywhere all in the name of a drug deal gone bad. Lynn knows the money has to be close, and with rising greed discovers the man who absconded with the suitcase. He takes it home, knowing he is now doomed, and begins a fateful attempt to run away from Javier's bloodlust and search for redemption.<br /><br />You might notice that I didn't mention Tommy Lee Jones at all, and for good reason. His scenes are utterly forgettable and serve as a lame attempt to make the violent events in the movie somehow poetic and bigger than the dealings of crime. A scene near the end with a former cop is the culmination of this big-headedness.<br /><br />This film is terribly overrated. Sure, it is entertaining and sure the actors worked hard. Sure, the lighting was used well, but this film leaves you with nothing after you see it except the question of why it won best picture. Perhaps it won simply because the other nominees weren't stellar either. Either way, this film will hardly be talked about for years to come.</p></body></html>

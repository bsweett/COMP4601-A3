Good production design all around.<br />*The Predators get to use most all of the great weapons introduced in previous films.  The Aliens exhibit the same unnatural intelligence (or instinct) as in the previous films.  This film also introduces some interesting, logical ideas (like how the Alien skeleton is acid-proof, or how the Aliens willingly kill themselves to free their queen...).<br />*Even though it seems a little silly, I thought it was cool to see the Predator bonding with the main character.<br />*Very fascinating story line that ties the two franchises together brilliantly (and still corresponds well to the original films).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not much blood or guts, which is truly unsual for an Alien or Predator film.  The unrated version has a little more, but is stil not much.<br />*Kind of boring for the first hour.<br />*Despite the interesting backstory, the movie itself reminds me of the other films made by this director (like "Event Horizon" or "Resident Evil," all of which showed the same spiel about a bunch of people who explore a dark place and encounter something scary).<br />*Most of the characters are dull.  They tried to develop them to an extent, but they are ultimately unmemorable.<br /><br />It took me a few viewings to truly appreciate this.  I really don't care much for the characters (even the main character), and most wind up dying anyway.  And when the film spends the first hour developing these boring characters, the film as a whole seems very tedious.  But, the second half is very cool; there are lots of great fight scenes and slick special effects.  I was largely impressed by the backstory that tied the Alien and Predator together.  While this hardly compares to the other Alien or Predator films, this is pretty fun.  Fans of either franchise should probably see this at least once.</p></body></html>

Normally, I wouldn't have minded the length of the movies.  I sat through Kingdom of Heaven and King Kong.  Time passed quickly but towards the third quarter of Alexander, my concentration started to give way.  I couldn't help but noticing Irish, English, Russian accents spoken as Macedonians.  The battles meant to be the highlight for movies of such proportions but it wasn't executed as successfully as in Kingdom of Heavens and even Troy!  Utlimately, it came to the direction of the movie.  I guess that the planning and execution of it wasn't tackled until the movie started.  Throughout the movie, Alexander tended to fight against his inner demons (with much manipulation by his mother, Olympia versus his father).  I tried to feel for Alexander, the flawed conqueror and yet, I couldn't.  The battles were many and emphasis was never made to let us relate between Alexander and his generals.  Oliver Stone the director painted them as racists and ignorant mercenaries who would fight one another the moment Alexander died.  The only bit that touched my heart would be that insignificant moment between Alexander and his favourite horse which was actually registered in history, the very horse that fought with him all the way to history.  The last quarter was the hardest bit to swallow with arty farty red against white background and pscyhedellic images to the point that it felt out of character with the rest of the movie.  There was much said about emphasis on Alexander's love for his male lover (Jared Leto) here that it 'killed' the movie.  However, the latest offering of Brokeback Mountain doesn't seem to have that problem.  The reality of the matter is Alexander is a commendable and valiant effort but pitching that against superior offering by Ridley Scott, it's simply a good but forgettable movie whilst Kingdom of Heaven seemed to be a well planned and executed balanced movie which would be seen as a standard for the Crusades theme in the forseeable future.  Alexander is very much an Oliver Stone movie as he suggested a conspiracy theory about the nature of Alexander's death, as narrated by Anthony Hopkin's character.  Alas......it would have been great.  Commendable but don't expect too much out of it.</p></body></html>

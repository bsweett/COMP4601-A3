Going into the film, I had some expectation (not a lot...but some) that it would be a fun creature-feature type flick. I mean it had an Academy Award winner as its star, it had to be somewhat better than a SyFy Channel original movie...right?<br /><br />Wrong!<br /><br />"Splice" tells the story of two genetic scientists (Adrian Brody & Sarah Polley)who've created a new life form by combining certain elements from a bunch of animals. These two "animals" which look like leather bags filled with bad cheese are producing an protien that helps fight diseases in animals. The scientists want to take the next step of adding human DNA into the mix. They are told no, and of course do it anyway. Soon a little hamster-chicken thing is running around the lab eating Tic Tac's. For some reason the hamster-chicken grows super-fast and the scientist begin raising it like a little girl, and before you know it blamm-o she's a young woman...with a poison filled stinger at the tip of her tail.<br /><br />There were just so many mis-steps in "Splice" it's difficult to just pinpoint where the movie veers off-course, but my guess would be when you first meet the two scientists in the opening scenes with their meat-sack creations, and by the time you see the little chicken-hamster thing, you can't help but start chuckling. What kind of scientists are these guys, the certainly aren't very good evil scientists, and they are not likable, and to top it off the they drive around in a 1970's era AMC Gremlin! Just poor judgement all aound.<br /><br />Also, on a side note. If you are making a horror film, at least try to make it somewhat scary. There is no tension, no suspense and no horror in "Splice"...well except for Adrian Brody's love-makin' face which we get to see twice unfortunately. Just a horrible film, that at times is laughable, but not in a good way. I recommend "Sharktopus" or "Dinocroc" instead. Sure they're bad, but they at least accomplish what they set out to do.</p></body></html>

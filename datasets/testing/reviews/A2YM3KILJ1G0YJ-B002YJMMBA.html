The mysterious and clandestine Illuminati plan on killing all four Cardinals at altars along the "Path of Illumination," and then destroying the Vatican with stolen antimatter from CERN.  Paired with CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), noted symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to neutralize the Illuminati's threat by saving the Cardinals and recovering the antimatter.<br /><br />What is apparent upon first viewing is a heavy dosage of Dan Brown's influence, that Tom Hanks is Robert Langdon personified, and themes of technology versus faith flow seamlessly into all facets of the film.  The visual aspects of A&D are absolutely stunning.  Considering Roman Catholic officials wouldn't allow filming inside any of their churches, the visual smorgasbord is even more impressive.  A&D has everything from St. Peter's Square to the Vatican and Sistine Chapel, it's what amounts to history and landmark pornography.  To look for some of the intricacies from this film while wandering throughout Rome might be ridiculous, but the special effects are done so well the viewer may get the feeling of a Frommer's tour guide.<br /><br />If Brown's meticulously researched style is your thing, then this wonderfully translated movie - despite its differences with the book - is sure to excite.  Fast paced and full of enough thrills to distract from the esotericism inherent in all of Brown's work, the action and acting are balanced predictably well for a big budget film featuring Hanks and Ewan McGregor.<br /><br />Bow down to the religious conspiracy in this adult version of National Treasure.  Honestly, taking Nicolas Cage out of any movie is a good move, amirite?<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

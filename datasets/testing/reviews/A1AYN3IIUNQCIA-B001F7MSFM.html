Now flash forward to '08 amd Guillermo Del Toro has now become a hot ticket following the success of Pan's Labryinth and much to my surprise, he decides to make a sequel to Hellboy, entiled the Golden Army. Most of the main cast return, Ron Perlman as Hellboy aka 'Red', Selma Blair as firestarter Liz Shermen, and Doug Jones as Abe, with the notable absence of Meyers but other then that one character, they are all back.<br /><br />The film begins with the story of the uneasy truce between mankind and the mystical creatures of the world, who hundreds of years ago fought a war between each other, which resulted in the construction of an unstoppable fighting force called the Golden Army. Hundreds of years later and the exiled prince of the elves has returned to claim the throne and launch war upon the human race, where it is up to Red and the gang to stop him before he unleashes the Golden Army once again and destroy the human race once and for all.<br /><br />With the recent success of his last film, Del Toro has been given full control over the film, injecting not only his deep sense of mythology but also keeping true to the comics roots, each scene popping with color and wonderous images that only Del Toro could do. Balancing well executed action sequences, crips humor, and visual effects, the film manages to be smooth rather then bogged down by so much material.<br /><br />In fact, 2008 has been a very good year for comic books, with the success of Iron Man in May, and the juggernaut that is The Dark Knight, Hellboy 2 completes the trifecta.</p></body></html>

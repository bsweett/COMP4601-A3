<meta name="summary" content="HAPPY FRIDAY THE 13TH!!!"></head><body><p>I thought it would be sweet to write a review on this particular horror film on this particular day! Friday the 13th is a really creepy movie! Some people may not know that Jason Voorhees is NOT the killer on this one. The setting of Camp Crystal Lake is awesome! The death scenes are kinda gory for an 80's slasher! If you love slashers, then hopefully you'll love FRIDAY THE 13TH<br /><br />p.s. I can't wait for the remake!!</p></body></html>

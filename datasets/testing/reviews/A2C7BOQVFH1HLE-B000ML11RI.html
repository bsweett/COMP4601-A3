<meta name="summary" content="Pulp Fiction Influenced Excellent Frank Miller Adaptation Makes For the Best Film I've Seen In Years!"></head><body><p>I've always been a big fan of Frank Miller ever since I first read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIKZEG">Batman the Dark Knight Returns #1 First Print</a> which I thought then and I still think now is the best comic book about The Batman ever written.  I never read "Sin City" and so I watched this without knowing anything about it prior and after having been jaded with really mediocre film offerings over recent years I really wasn't expecting much and so I was blown away with just how good this film is.  It was like watching a comic book come alive and just like my favourite comic book mentioned earlier I really enjoyed this great piece of writing by Frank Miller.  The film reminded me a lot of another great film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006BSBW">Pulp Fiction</a> and I guess with the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino as "guest director" this shouldn't surprise me but using the same tactic of merging apparently different storylines really works here unlike elsewhere like in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V38">Chungking Express</a> where it really didn't work as well.  Although some have tried and doubtless many more will try in the future this almost new genre of graphic novel films has a new standard upon which others will be measured and this film is it.  Great storytelling, great acting and as far as this dvd goes excellent picture and DTS 5.1 surround sound quality makes this just a great film to watch over and over again like any classic film should be.<br /><br />My great wish now is for the same directors to do an even better job if possible on a similar film version of my favourite graphic novel "The Dark Knight Returns".  "Sin City" for now though is one of the best films that I've watched in many many years and this dvd is also among the best both picture and sound quality-wise that I've seen on a non-Blu-ray format.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

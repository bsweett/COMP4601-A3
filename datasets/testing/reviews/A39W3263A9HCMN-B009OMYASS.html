Now, he's back with a total crap fest called HOSTEL, which is 95 minutes of my life I'll NEVER get back!<br /><br />STORY: 3 teenagers on a European trip get locked outside the hostel they are staying in. They go to their friends as a source of help and are told about a Slovakian hostel with total chicks. They take a trip to Slovakia and stay at the hostel, with total chicks for roomates. But that's not all, one by one each teenager dissapears, and it'a all up to Paxton to find out...then Paxton is next.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: What a waste of film! I kept wanting to turn the movie off. It has no gore, and if you want gore, watch SAW, SAW 2 or DEAD ALIVE. That's what I call gore.</p></body></html>

It is less funny than it is melancholy, and somehow the players - from the always-fantastically real Toni Colette to the surprisingly layered Greg Kinnear, put heart into a screenplay that likes to go out of its way to be wacky and offkilter.  And to top it off, Steve Carell's turn as the suicidal Proust scholar should get him an Academy Award nomination -seriously.  It is one of those wildly great performances that pop out of nowhere - his innate humor informs the soul of a man who is brilliant, haunted and observant. The movie's slapdash ending has a generic, been-there-before silliness, but this is often a very entertaining and moving slice of life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superman Returns"></head><body><p>Superman (Routh) is back, five years after where "Superman II" left off.  He returned to Krypton, hoping to find some life still there, but when he found nothing, he returned to Earth.  As Clark Kent, he gets his job back at the Daily Planet, and is reunited with Lois Lane (Bosworth).  But, people have moved on.  Lois has a five year old son, and a boyfriend (Marsden).  She has also won a Pulitzer for an article about how the world does not need Superman.  Elsewhere, Lex Luthor (Spacey) is free from prison, and up to no good.  It seems that he has found Superman's Fortress of Solitude, and has devised a plan with what he found there that will wipe out most of the United States.  Once again, Superman must try to stop Luthor's evil scheme, and try to win the girl in the process.  But things will be a little more difficult this time.<br /><br />After almost two decades, Superman is finally back.  Bryan Singer takes the helm as director after bowing out of the X-Men franchise.  Not the wisest move, but it is the opportunity of a lifetime to bring back the Man of Steel.  He does a few things right.  First, he uses the backstory established in "Superman" and "Superman II", wisely ignoring "III" and "IV", and not having to do a complete reboot.  He attempts to have a look of continuity and even uses John Williams' famous themes from those films.  This IS the Superman we grew up with, he has just been away for a while.  Kevin Spacey is great as Luthor, bring menace and some humor to the role.  He even manages to inflict some pain on the hero.  On the weak side, Lex's plan is dumb.  For as smart as he is supposed to be, he has not really thought things through.  Kate Bosworth is weak as Lois, and James Marsden has the unenviable role of being the other man.  Brandon Routh does not bring much to the table as Superman/Clark Kent except a resemblance to Christopher Reeve.  Finally, the running time is way too long to support the story.  Some trimming could have improved the story's flow.<br /><br />Yet, for the most part, it works.  It is good to see Superman back after all these years.  The effects are top notch, and the movie is mostly fun.  I do recommend this movie, but I hope that the filmmakers are able to tighten things up the next time around.  A sequel is planned (duh), and could be better than this restart.  For now, we can enjoy what we have.</p></body></html>

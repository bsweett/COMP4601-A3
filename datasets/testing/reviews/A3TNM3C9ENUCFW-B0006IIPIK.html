I think people will either love or hate this movie, with little chance for middle ground, but whichever way you fall, you have to admire Writer/Director Kerry Conrans, vision and resolve in getting this (his first movie) onto the big screen. This is a loving homage to a bygone era of Biggles, Saturday morning heroes, 50's Sci Fi movies, and the Wizard of Oz. It is fantastical, tongue in cheek, inventive yet predictable but somehow it's just TOO much of a mixed bag for my taste. The complete blue screen CGI production gave Conran unlimited artistic licence, and the effects are impressive, even if they are almost a pastiche on old Sci Fi flicks, and serial cliffhangers. The trouble is that he has deliberately shown them as special effects, the sepia drenched resolution throughout, and not exactly seemless matching of live action with CGI is obviously on purpose in trying to emulate the back cloths, rockets on string, and dodgy effects of the aforementioned films, on which this is loosely based. If (and it's a sizeable IF) you can embrace this idea, you will love the movie, but the average viewer will probably be completely misled by the trailers, DVD sleeve, and advertising, and think EH?. It helps to understand that Conran spent 4 years at home on his own computer making 6 minutes of screen time of this mythical "World of Tomorrow" and that was enough to sell the production team and actors. That said, most of the talent is wasted with the exception of Jude Law as the sprightly gentleman "hero" of the title. Of course, the script was not exactly taxing, and the supporting cast have adapted the role well, but Gwyneth Paltrow trying to be a female Indiana Jones style intrepid reporter was simply a job of bad casting, or was it? - perhaps this too was designed to mirror the often wooden performances in old B movies?<br /><br />This is not a bad movie, but it's really not one thing or another, and came across as a bit of a mess I felt - It'll probably hold your attention until the last reel, but my advice would be rent before you buy. I often watch movies many times, but one viewing was about all I could take here.</p></body></html>

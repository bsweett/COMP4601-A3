In it, Laura Linney plays Erin Bruner, an aggressive (and agnostic) junior partner at her law firm who jumps at the chance to defend a Catholic priest in a negligent homicide case.  She has a track record of "getting off" guilty parties and she also wants to make senior partner.  With a high profile case like this, she'd be a fool to pass it up.  Unfortunately for her, the case isn't as easy to digest.  It involves a young lady's death after a failed exorcism.  The girl, Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), had been diagnosed by medical professionals to be both epileptic and psychotic.  However, under the guidance of their parish priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), the family takes Emily off of her medication and seeks to have her undergo an exorcism in an attempt to remove her demons.<br /><br />The case is very interesting to watch as it plays out on the screen.  Campbell Scott is perfect as the prosecutor attempting to find Father Moore guilty as charged.  He attacks the medical angle of the case while Linney's character, getting hammered in the courthouse, attempts to prove that Emily actually was possessed by some sort of demonic forces.  The deeper that she and Father Moore get involved in the case, the stranger things get.<br /><br />With time split between flashbacks of Emily's agonizing experience and the battle in the courtroom, this tale is woven in such a way that the viewer has little relief from the tension that builds.  The story moves at a pace that builds on fear and faith, making for a brilliant ride.<br /><br />The acting is superb in this film.  Carpenter literally changes from a sweet and innocent young girl into a ravaged carcass under the grip of no less than six demons.  One demon in particular will be quite familiar to all of us.  Wilkinson is believable as the parish priest intent on telling Emily's story with no regard for his own life.  As stated before, Scott handles his role in superior fashion.  Perhaps the character who changes more than any other (excepting Emily) is Laura Linney's.  Though she begins this film as an agnostic, her soul is chipped at by the dark forces she is fighting in the courtroom.<br /><br />With equal parts drama and religious struggle, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is one of the best films to come out this year.  It will make you question your faith, fear the unknown, and, perhaps, even strengthen your own beliefs.  Highly recommended for its wonderful and horrid tale, though this unrated version is nothing for young children to see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Powerful, but perhaps takes a too-easy approach to Rwanda"></head><body><p>After seeing HOTEL RWANDA in a local theater a few months ago, I knew I had seen something powerful and memorable. But there is one little germ of doubt that persists in my mind about director and co-writer Terry George's approach to dealing with the tragic events that occurred in Rwanda in 1994. In telling the heroic story of hotel owner Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle)---an ordinary Hutu man who eventually ended up saving the lives of many Tutsis---I wonder if George perhaps took the easy way out. Let me explain.<br /><br />George clearly has something to say with this film. Not only is he, like Rusesabagina, horrified by the genocide that was allowed to Tutsis in Rwanda; he is also disturbed by what he sees as American reluctance to seriously intervene in a situation that simply screams of human rights violations. It is an anger that infuses much of HOTEL RWANDA; it is what gives the movie much of its emotional punch. I wonder, though, if George fundamentally miscalculated by telling Rusesabagina's story and trying to make an uplifting movie, rather than telling another, more tragic story. It seems a bit too easy to tell yet another crowd-pleasing "triumph of the human spirit" story when such a massive tragedy perhaps cries out for a rawer approach. Perhaps the anguish at the heart of George's film might have been much more powerful, both emotionally and intellectually, if he had told a sadder, more humbling story that---for lack of more eloquent terms---really rubbed your face in the madness that overtook Rwanda in 1994, and the agonizing indifference of foreign troops to this massive human tragedy (an indifference that, some might argue, we are witnessing once again with many foreign nations' reluctance to directly intervene in the Darfur situation today). In short, I think HOTEL RWANDA suffers just a little bit from what I can only attribute to Terry George's divided intentions: he wants to tell an uplifting, "triumph of the human spirit" story---one that echoes Oskar Schindler's heroism in Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST---but also wants to ask serious questions about whether we did enough to prevent the Rwandan genocide from getting out of control. And, by doing the former, he perhaps stunts the latter, to some extent.<br /><br />Still, George does tell a powerful story in HOTEL RWANDA, and the film, as a whole, is undeniably compelling and moving. The fact that the film raises such relevant issues at all is to be admired.<br /><br />And Don Cheadle is to be admired, too. The character of Paul Rusesabagina is, almost unbelievably, Cheadle's first lead role, and he comes through with an amazing performance. The desperation Rusesabagina feels as he tries to negotiate for the lives of the Tutsi refugees (including his Tutsi wife, played by Sophie Okenedo), the horror he feels when he sees a street littered with corpses---all this comes through authentically in Cheadle's performance. In fact, I think Cheadle may have come up with the most viscerally powerful scene from the movies last year. It comes right after he sees that corpse-strewn street. Paul is back at his hotel, in his room. He tries to tie his tie, but he is so unnerved by what he has just seen that he never seems able to get it right. Finally, emotion so overtakes him that he throws down his tie in anger and breaks down right next to his bedroom door. The sheer raw emotion of Cheadle's wordless action in that scene is something that I certainly have not forgotten since seeing it; if Jamie Foxx had not so awed people with his interpretation of Ray Charles in RAY, Cheadle might have copped a well-deserved Oscar on that scene alone. (As impressive as Foxx undoubtedly was in RAY, not even he, in one of the final scenes set at a drug rehab center, came up with something as powerful---and as real---as Cheadle's quiet explosion in HOTEL RWANDA.)<br /><br />Despite my reservation about Terry George's rather timid (and occasionally heavy-handed) approach to dealing with the Rwandan genocide, HOTEL RWANDA is worth seeing not only for the troubling issues it raises, but also for Cheadle's great lead performance.

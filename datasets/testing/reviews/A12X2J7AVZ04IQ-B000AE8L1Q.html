Joan Allen and Kevin Costner were so in touch with the material that the 4 young starlets as her daughters were a little left out of the picture. Still, Ms. Allen was amazing in a complex characterization that left me exhausted. The hurt, confusion and anger were well displayed. Costner won a few awards for his performance, a presence that was at once cute and clever, as well as deeply concerned. Writer/director Mike Binder also filled the role of Costner's sleazy producer with vigor. Many have said that the four young ladies (daughters) were superficial, which may be a bit true, but this film was about Joan. Her daughters weren't very nice to her when she needed them most. The last film I can remember where 4 ingenues were thrown at you at once was "Mona Lisa Smile", but it was a different type of story, giving each a definite agenda. Binder created moments that almost looked like they were in fast-forward, showing Ms Allen's perception. That was clever. Once again, this is Ms Allen's film. My attention didn't stray much from her issues at hand. Though her daughters created some added angst, I was more concerned with how Ms Allen dealt with that angst. It's a really tough role, and she has no end of my admiration.  The clever, rapid-fire dialogue was reminiscent of the best of Billy Wilder or Preston Sturges. I'm sorry I found more to enjoy than many others, but am glad I got to experience this unusual and enjoyable romp.</p></body></html>

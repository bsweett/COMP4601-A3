<meta name="summary" content="A future murder mystery"></head><body><p>The movie starts by showing the Three Laws of Robotics. They appear within what are the workings of a robots positronic brain. Though taken from a number of short stories by Isaac Asimov, do not expect it to be faithful. It is a fast paced detective story. Filled with action and many great special effects.<br /><br />Will Smith plays our detective, Del Spooner, and suspects a robot of murder. He believes a robot, called Sonny is the murderer. Though no one else can even conceive of such a concept. He follows a trail of clues that leads him toward solving the case. Will is his usual self in this movie...just in better shape.<br /><br />In contrast, we have Dr. Susan Calvin played by Bridget Moynahan. She believes that Sonny did not commit murder. For it would violate the main law of the Three Laws of Robotics, that is hardwired into each robot. She starts off true to the Asimov character, but evolves, as all good characters should in a good movie.<br /><br />Though a Sci-Fi/Action Adventure movie. Its plot is that of a murder mystery. And in that aspect, I think this movie was well done. And you will be thrown a twist during the course of the movie. If that is not enough for you. You may just want to watch a movie for great action and fun.</p></body></html>

It could be possible that I didn't expect much from this movie that sounded so much like a cheap retread of old glory. In fact, like many, I had no intention of seeing it until I was coax into the theater. When I saw it, I was very surprised how good the movie turned out to be and how well Stallone presented this movie. The movie proves to be surprisingly deep, entertaining and well told story. As one previous reviewers stated, it proves to be a worthy "bookend". This is the best Rocky film since the first one came out 30 years ago. Stallone tell this story with certain amount of flair and good taste. It shouldn't surprised anyone by the time that familiar tune come blaring out that movie's format create a situation we all been waiting for. The fight scenes, exciting as it was, provided an end result of well put together movie. Since the story of this movie have been rehashed many times, I won't bother rehashing it again.<br /><br />The DVD of this movie turned out to be pretty good. The images proves to be pristine, the sound was aggressive and clear and extras proves to be entertaining and educational.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone gambled greatly in making this movie. If it fail, he would have probably been heelhaul out of Hollywood. But fully understanding his own limitation as well as his character, Stallone put together a movie that will definitely surprise many who may see this movie for the first time on DVD.</p></body></html>

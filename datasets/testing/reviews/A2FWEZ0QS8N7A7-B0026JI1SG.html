<meta name="summary" content="The Master Returns"></head><body><p>Let's make it clear up front -- there is no working director/actor more in command of his art than Clint Eastwood.  He proves it again with Million Dollar Baby, whose plot line is well-known enough to not need repeating here.<br /><br />With each scene, Eastwood moves his story forward.  Nothing feels forced or faked up for greater emotional intensity.  Even the controversial twist, a melodramatic moment if there ever was one, is not overdone, although in its use of slow-mo it recalls a key scene in In the Line of Fire where, of course, Eastwood acted but did not direct.<br /><br />The boxing action is tough and authentic; every character, with the slight exception of Maggie's obnoxious family, lives as an individual, not a cliche.  Eastwood has this old-fashioned idea that if you have a story, characters with ideas, and, yes, values, you don't need glitz, noise or other attention-grabbing filler.  As with Mystic River, check out the color that Eastwood uses to set each scene and the overall mood of the film.  Also as with Mystic River, the characters grapple with everyman's eternal issues, loyalty, love, friendship, loss, guilt, and a search for meaning against the terrifying suspicion that it may not exist.<br /><br />On that controversial twist: the criticism being rained on Eastwood from various quarters is completely unwarranted.  As he himself has said in interviews, he is not making a generalized statement of a position; he is showing how one person struggles with and resolves a terrible situation.  It's an individual's choice in a story; it's not a paradigm or meant to advocate.<br /><br />Haven't mentioned the acting, but we're talking Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint himself.  As they used to say in Marvel Comics, 'nuff said.<br /><br />I do have two nitpicks -- Maggie won her fight since her opponent would certainly have been DQ'ed for her action and Morgan Freeman's voiceover narration is used too frequently, especially early on.  Actually, I have a third too, but that would give away a key plot element more than I already have.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby, though I slightly prefer the somber power of Mystic River, is simply superb.  If it loses the Academy Award for Best Picture to a bio pic -- however, well done -- about a boring billionaire, there is no justice.  But then that's one of Clint's eternal themes, isn't it?</p></body></html>

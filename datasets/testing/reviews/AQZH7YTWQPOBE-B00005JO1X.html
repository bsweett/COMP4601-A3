<meta name="summary" content="Good film adaptation, but could have been great"></head><body><p>After a horrid BBC adaptation of C.S. Lewis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00146LW0G">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>, Disney's  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> does a decent job of bringing the first book to life. The Pevensie kids were generally well cast, and Georgie Henley as young Lucy steals the show. James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus is also very good. The film provides a visual feast, from snowy mountains to fauns and minotaurs.  Harry Gregson-Williams' moving soundtrack provides an epic backdrop for the action.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as much as I like it, I just felt like I couldn't give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> five stars. Coming so soon after the Lord of the Rings trilogy, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> obviously invites comparisons. However, Disney just doesn't meet the high standards those films set. For one thing, some of the roles are miscast. William Moseley as Peter never shows much passion. Tilda Swinton as the evil queen never really worked for me, although she has some moments (such as riding in a sleigh pulled by polar bears). Some of the animal computer-generated characters look cartoonish, especially the wolves, although Aslan the lion himself looks great. Overall, these are a few details that, with a bit more work, could have been improved.<br /><br />I think it's fair to say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> will be remembered as a well-done, entertaining movie adaptation, but not an outstanding work of art along the lines of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. The film is fun, entertaining, and likely to please fans of Lewis' novels, but, with a bit more time and effort, could have been even better. Ultimately, I don't think Disney and director Andrew Adamson were a right fit for the series, which makes it good news that the next films (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) will be in good hands.</p></body></html>

Another person, Marshall,  talks to Earl. "What's wrong?" [Talking to an imaginary man!] We slowly learn about Earl's secret life. Brooks changes to dark clothes then enters an apartment. Two shots [that no one hears?]. Then he drives away with his pictures. The imaginary man talks to him. The police investigate the crime scene and recognize the modus operandi. "Nobody saw a thing." We see Earl at a meeting, he admits to being an addict. We see his large factory. His daughter visits him with news about leaving school. "College is a waste of time." A visitor brings a packet of surprising photos! We see how spoiled his daughter is. "Mr. Smith" tells Earl what he wants! "Do we have a deal?" They talk and make an appointment.<br /><br />Detective Atwood and her lawyers discuss a divorce settlement. "Get over it!" A dangerous convict escaped and could threaten Tracy! Brooks visits "Smith" at night. [How did he get in?] The daughter tells the truth to her parents. They accept this news. The detective examines the scene of the double murder, and across the street. The pair will drive around and look for a victim in the rainy night! "Never kill someone you know." A pickup truck presents a victim. They will research the victim to avoid loose ends. [Can they get all that information from the Internet?] There is a shocking surprise on the street when a man grabs a woman. [Were you lulled by the preceding conversation?] This exciting action should wake you up! The two wait for their selected victim when they see a couple.<br /><br />The police continue to search for the "Thumbprint Killer". Brooks explains his reasons to Mr. Smith. Two detectives from Palo Alto want to question Jane. Emma calls a criminal lawyer for Jane. What will the detectives do? [The apple falls near the tree?] Brooks makes new plans. Detective Atwood follows "Mr. Smith", she has a hunch. A newspaper has a coded message for "Mr. Smith". Atwood questions "Mr. Smith" again! They search for Meigs and find a shocking surprise! Brooks returns from Palo Alto. He is unhappy with his existence. There was another murder with a hatchet last night, Jane had an alibi. What will Brooks do now? [Is the talk confusing?] We see the selected victims. "Hello!" Mr. Smith is excited afterwards. Bafferd is gone! Detective Atwood gets shocking news!<br /><br />There is a surprise in the car. Brooks explains how he will disappear. Atwood searches for Bafferd and gets a lucky break to solve a case! Brooks visits a cemetery. There is another surprise! [Didn't you suspect this would happen?] Brooks resolves to end his addiction. He makes a call using Bafferd's cell phone and explains what he did! Atwood asks his location; no reply. Later there is a final shocking surprise! [I didn't expect this.] What a nightmare ending!<br /><br />I think this would be better as a short story than a full-length movie (where you can question some of the assumptions). I don't think its probable that a successful businessman could be serial killer (as shown here). His time would be taken up by normal activities so wouldn't have time to spare for his addiction. I would not recommend this movie, but is has some interesting plot features that make up for the time spent watching it. There are better movies to watch. I's sure this was a deserved flop at the box office.</p></body></html>

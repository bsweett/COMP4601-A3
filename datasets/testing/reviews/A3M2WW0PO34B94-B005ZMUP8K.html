Thar be a rip roaring adventure out there for all to enjoy. The sequel to the enormously popular film based on a ride at the Disney theme parks. "Dead Man's Chest" be one of those rare things, more precious than a Black Pearl, it be a sequel that works well. So far, "Dead Men's Chest" is the most enjoyable big studio release of the summer.<br /><br />We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot...<br /><br />Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) watches as rain pours down, destroying the area where her wedding was to take place. Soon, Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander), a leader of the East India Trading Company, arrives to arrest Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth, forcing the wedding to be cancelled indefinitely. But he doesn't really want either of them, he wants Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) compass, which can lead people to the location of what they most desire. But Sparrow has problems of his own. Regaining control of the Black Pearl, he soon realizes he has the Black Mark and must repay his debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the Captain of the Flying Dutchman, a creepy ship with a crew of Pirates who have died and pledged their allegiance to the half-man, half crustacean leader of the deep. If Sparrow is unable to repay the debt, Jones will release a terrible beast called the Kracken to reclaim the Black Pearl to the sea. But Sparrow is on a quest of his own, he wants to find a key; the key will open a buried chest containing the most prized possession of Davy Jones. Soon, all three are back together, fighting against one another and for the same cause.<br /><br />Drink up, me `earties, yo ho...<br /><br />One of the great pleasures of "Pirates of the Carribean" is Johnny Depps very eccentric performance. As Captain Jack Sparrow, he flounces around, channeling the spirit of Keith Richards into a boozy, effeminate ne'er do well who always manages to keep one step ahead of the authorities, enemies and death.<br /><br />We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot...<br /><br />Depp always provides an interesting performance, even when the film is less than spectacular. "Pirates" Sparrow seems to be the perfect combination for this esoteric actor's charms. Let's face it. Sparrow is an over the top character; a pirate who walks in a vapor of rum fumes, his dirty dreadlocks and bad teeth shining like beacons as he slurs his words. This pirate provides the actor with the perfect avenue for his abilities. In lesser hands, the character would be a disaster. But Depp embraces the role, kidnapping our better judgment, ravaging us with the persona. And he doesn't give a hoot.<br /><br />I have no doubt the character will be remembered for a long time.<br /><br />Drink up me `earties, yo ho...<br /><br />A key part of Depp's performance is Sparrow's constant influx of booze. In "Dead Man's Chest", he spends a significant amount of time worrying about his store of rum.<br /><br />Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me...<br /><br />Part of the reason for the success of this sequel is the return of the entire cast and key members of the crew. Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport (British TV's "Coupling"), MacKenzie Crook (British TV's "The Office") and more. All of the actors from the first have returned, which is a bit of a spoiler. Think about it. Think about it. This means the sequel has a higher chance of being consistent with the first. In fact, they filmed both "Dead Man's Chest" and "Pirates 3" at the same time, ensuring even more consistency.<br /><br />But consistency can be bad. In some cases, this works. In others, it doesn't. Because the first film was so enjoyable, chances are the sequel would follow in the correct footsteps. Naturally, there are no guarantees. Look at "The Matrix" trilogy for how wrong this can go. First film, brilliant. Second film, good. Third film, a disaster. "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy was made as one large movie, with the cast and crew working consistently for years, and director Peter Jackson created a trilogy that will be remembered for ever.<br /><br />So far, we have a great first entry and a very enjoyable, amusing second.<br /><br />We extort, we pilfer, we filch and we sack...<br /><br />The biggest drawback to "Dead Man's Chest" is the lack of surprise in the performances. Much of the fun of the first film was watching Depp's great performance as he revealed more and more nuances. The performance is amusing and fun, but it doesn't surprise us.<br /><br />Unfortunately, bringing all of the characters back means Orlando Bloom returns as well. Bloom is good looking, I get it. But he is also one of the most boring actors to ever grace the silver screen. His stock and trade seems to be one facial expression, determined, his mouth, his eyes, nothing ever changes, no matter what the situation. His only concession to creating a character seems to be responding to others when they call his character's name. "Will?" "Yes."<br /><br />Drink up, me `earties, yo ho.<br /><br />The main addition to the cast is Bill Nighy who plays Davy Jones. You may not recognize the name, but I can guarantee you have probably seen him in some British film or other. He generally plays eccentric, older men, like the aging rocker in "Love, Actually". In "Dead Man's Chest", he has so much make up on, you would never recognize his face.<br /><br />As Davy Jones, he plays the Pirate of folklore who lives at the bottom of the sea. The filmmakers have created a very unique visual look for Jones and his crew; because the pirates are living in the sea, they have begun to assimilate various fish and other sea creatures into their bodies. Jones is part octopus, barnacles, crab and lobster with a whole host of other creepy crawlies crawling out of every orifice. It is a great look and helps to make the legend believable.<br /><br />Jones's ship, the Flying Dutchman is equally impressive. Covered with barnacles and living creatures, the sails are covered with eels, it has the ability to submerge and reappear above water at will.<br /><br />Maraud and embezzle, and even high-jack...<br /><br />I always find it a little easier to lose myself in a fantasy if there is at least a little basis in reality. In "Dead Man's Chest", the new `villain' in the film appears in the form of Beckett (Tom Hollander), the officer of the East India Trading Company. This company is so powerful and sponsored by the British Government, they are quickly taking over every port in the Carribean, extending their reach and their influence, running the pirates out of business. Actually, they are simply legalizing piracy, making it their own, and taking control of it.<br /><br />Beckett wants a compass in the possession of Sparrow and he needs Will to get it for him. This is the start of the adventure and ultimately will bring the three main characters back together.<br /><br />Drink up me `earties, yo ho...<br /><br />The other major addition to the cast is Stellan Skarsgard who plays Bootstrap Bill, Will's (Bloom) father. A pirate, he has made a deal with Jones and now serves as one of his crew. Throughout the film, we see his transformation, as barnacles and other sea creatures slowly attach to him, making him one of Jone's crew for the rest of eternity.<br /><br />Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me...<br /><br />The film is simply beautiful to look at. Using some spectacularly beautiful locations in the Carribean, the film seems to shimmer with color. As the action moves to a port, or to a shack in a swamp, the crew is clearly modeling the look after the popular ride, and fans of the ride will love the references, but the attention to detail is superb.<br /><br />We kindle and char, inflame and ignite...<br /><br />There are a couple of spectacular action sequences. The first is a lengthy bit involving circular cages made of bones. All of Sparrow's men and Turner are captured by a band of natives and imprisoned in two balls hanging over a gorge. Their method of escape is truly interesting, unusual and fun.<br /><br />But the real standout is a lengthy duel between Sparrow, Turner and Norrington. I know you have probably seen duels before, but this is a standout sequence. During a chase through the countryside, they end up in a broken down mill. Soon, the action shifts to the old water wheel on the outside. The three men end up on the wheel and it breaks off the structure, rolling down the hillside, with all three inside. As it moves, the three men end up in various fighting positions; imagine three hamsters in an exercise wheel, but fighting one another.<br /><br />Drink up, me `earties, yo ho.<br /><br />"Dead Man's Chest" isn't a perfect film. In addition to Orlando Bloom, the film is about 15 minutes too long and it simply stops, not really ending, providing a starting point for the third installment. This give "Dead Man's Chest" an incomplete feeling.<br /><br />These minor quibbles aside, "Dead Man's Chest" is a rousing adventure which will provide a lot of fun for everyone. Drink up, me `earties, yo ho.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Say Bah Humbug To Those Who Disliked This Charming Little Animated Film"></head><body><p>Without question, the current success enjoyed by "Happy Feet" owes much to the great French documentary "March Of The Penguins", though I strongly suspect that this fine animated film was well in the works prior to news of the documentary film's release. Australian film director George Miller, best known for his "Mad Max" films and "Babe", has created a delightful, charming film about what it means to be different - and celebrating that difference - featuring some of the best animation I have seen lately not done by Pixar Studios. And I might add too that Miller has done a decent job in choosing pop songs for the film's music, sung well by the likes of Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman and Brittany Murphy (Without a doubt, Miller is paying homage to fellow Australian Baz Luhrman's "Moulin Rouge", and nearly suceeds in pulling off his own musical highwire act in this film.). Elijah Wood's loveable young Emperor Penguin, Mumbles, nearly steals every scene he is in, except when he interacts with Jackass Penguins Ramon and Lovelace (Both voiced to dazzling hilarious effect by Robin Williams.). I say "Bah Humbug" to those who've dislked this charming little animated film; it's dual uplifting messages of celebrating those who are different from the rest of the pack and helping to preserve Antarctica from overfishing are those which are not only timely, but more importantly, worthy of attention to entire families. Moreover, the "adult" pop songs are used to such great comedic effect, that only those familiar with Prince's music, for example, might find their usage in this film a bit too risque for the entire family to enjoy. Truly, without question, "Happy Feet" deserves all the honors it has earned so far, and definitely ranks among my best films of 2006.</p></body></html>

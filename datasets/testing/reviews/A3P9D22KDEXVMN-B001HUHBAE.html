<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Movie and Performances"></head><body><p>I have just finished viewing the 2007 film Zodiac - directed by David Fincher - about the infamous serial killer.  What an excellent movie.  The acting in this movie was exceptional, especially Jake Gyllenhaal as cartoonist Robert Graysmith, Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi, and Robert Downey Jr. as crime reporter Paul Avery.  The movie also features a solid turn for Anthony [of ER fame] Edwards as Toschi's partner Inspector William Armstrong.  John Carroll Lynch [from the Drew Carey show, among many other films and shows] also does a fine job as one of the suspect's; the creepy Arthur Leigh Allen.<br /><br />The cinematography truly captures a late 60's through 70's San Francisco.  The visuals were very pleasing in this film.  There were several very chilling moments in the movie as well.  Admittedly, I had not read either of Graysmith's books.  I did; however, thumb through both at the bookstore, so I had some idea who the author ultimately believed was the killer.  The movie kept you guessing the entire time.  The music perfectly captured the uncomfortable sense of foreboding that went with several of the scenes.<br /><br />The theme of the movie is obviously obsession and how it overcomes people.  I don't think that is always bad, especially in a case like this where the end result will - hopefully - net the arrest of a dangerous criminal.  Gyllenhaal really was outstanding in the way his performance sold the obsession that Graysmith developed with the case.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in crime movies, true stories, and true mysteries.  First and foremost, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys great films, great directing, and great acting.  I found Zodiac to be a thoroughly engrossing 5 star movie experience.  I was disappointed that there were not special features included with the DVD, as I would have enjoyed seeing/hearing from the real Graysmith.</p></body></html>

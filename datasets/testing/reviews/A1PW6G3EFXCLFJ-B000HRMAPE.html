<meta name="summary" content="SOULLESS MISSION IMPROBABLE"></head><body><p>This is another slick, high-tech action film in the Mission Impossible series. It might just as easily be called Mission Improbable III due to the improbably poor shooting and judo ability of the villians and the improbably super human athletic ability of the good guy, played by Tom Cruise. We have Tom rescuing his fiancee from the psychotic chief bad guy, played by Oscar-winning Philip Seymour Hoffman, but then IMPROBABLY going completely out of character for a highly trained agent by sappily kissing his lover after untying her and, by doing so, drops his guard for the bad guys to jump him again. (Geez, Louise!) Mix in an improbable plot and stir. But, no worries, mate. Forget all that. Sit back and enjoy the well-choreographed action sequences with a 44-year Tom Cruise doing many of his own stunts. Also enjoy the beautiful cinematography and high production values. A comparison of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III to the less high-tech opening scenes of TRUE LIES is illuminating. In the latter, Arnold Schwarzenegger, with the help of buddy and partner Tom Arnold, crashes a party at a mansion, peels down to a tux and does a cool tango, then escapes on a high-speed ski mobile in a forest at night, all the while gunning down chasing bad guys. For all its high-tech gadgetry and jaw-dropping scenes, MI III lacks the wit, charm and romance of those wonderful opening moments of TRUE LIES. What that comparison shows, I posit, is that you don't need so much high-tech wizardry to make a great action flick and that humor, style and a good script can give a high-tech film a soul. (Where are you, Arnie baby?) Nice shots of Shanghai, China.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Disney/Pixar Triumph!!!"></head><body><p>With a genius that only a Disney/Pixar partnership can create, Cars comes off as one of the most entertaining movies of the last several years. With characters like Lightning McQueen, Tow Mater, Doc Hudson and the voice talents of Owen Wilson, Larry The Cable Guy and Paul Newman just to name a few, this movie delivers time and again! There are lessons/morals that can teach kids about priorities and what not, but there are enough laughs for both little kids and big kids alike!<br /><br />Radiator Springs is brilliantly-colored and the inhabitants come to life in this cinematic event. I loved it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Adore Johnny Depp, But Not This Film"></head><body><p>Yes, it is possible to get too much of a good thing. Unrelenting action, confusing twists and turns of plots and sub-plots, creative special effects -- yes, this movie is just too full. And, to be blunt, too long.<br /><br />OK, I love Johnny Depp about as much as it's possible to love any actor. One who hasn't actually showed up at my doorstep in the flesh, that is. (That's the only thing wrong with Johnny; he apparently does not even know I exist.) But the last hour of this movie could have been edited down to half an hour without losing anything all that great. We can only have so many clashes of one faction against another, only so many people slamming against the deck as the Kraken's tentacles sway menacingly and curl around everything they touch, only so many scenes of using the little undead monkey for comedy relief . . . I think I actually nodded off there for awhile.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie on the whole. But frankly, the members of the Davy Jones crew are indistinguishably horrible, and I never did get up any perceptible sympathy for Bootstrap Turner. And they might have slowed the pace just a tiny bit once in awhile, so I could breathe.</p></body></html>

I had never seen the film but had embraced the novel head on and respect it in its entirety.  My best friend told me that I had to see the film if I loved the novel so much.  He had seen it numerous times and just knew that it would interest me.  So I finally buckled down and rented this film and dare I say that it is one of the best motion pictures to ever be released.  For a film of the 70's it barely seems dated for the acting is top notch and the direction by Kubrick may very well be his finest.  Kubrick faithfully adapted Anthony Burgess' classic novel with fervor and fearlessness, not shying away from the darkness that clouded the pages.<br /><br />Let it be known that `A Clockwork Orange' is not a film for everyone, but it is a film that everyone should see.  I don't know if that makes perfect sense so let me see if I can explain.  In my humble opinion `A Clockwork Orange' delves into some of the most intricate workings of mankind.  It fleshes out the demons, the innate desire to have total control and it asks the questions that we do well to ask ourselves with regard to crime and punishment, vengeance and mercy.  In this respect it is an important film that begs to be lauded and respected.  In do this though is breaches dark territory and at times is both vulgar and explicit.  It is shocking, even with its age, and can at times even repel the audience.  Nothing is glorified, in fact it is extremely detestable and looked down upon, but it is visually included and very much a large part of the film.  In that respect not everyone can handle a film of this nature.<br /><br />The film (as does the novel) centers around a young man by the name of Alex.  Alex is, for lack of a better word, a gang member.  He walks the streets at night with his friends making trouble, stealing, pillaging, assaulting...killing.  Alex though has a bit of a power issue and this incessant need to be the ringleader puts him at odds with his fellow `droogs', Pete, Georgie and Dim.  When Alex is arrested and incarcerated he begins to see the folly of his ways.  Whether or not this `transformation' is real or merely an attempt at freedom is left up to the viewer in this instance (I'll get back to this point in a minute) but the `transformation', real or fake, is there and this prompts Alex to volunteer for a new government procedure supposedly able to cure him of his sick and twisted tendencies.<br /><br />My one disappointment with the film is one I saw coming.  The film was adapted from the originally released version of the novel.  So, the film, much like that novel, is unfinished, incomplete...wrong.  Anthony Burgess had written one final chapter, a controversial chapter that was omitted in order to boost sales by the publishing house.  This final chapter takes the novel to a whole new level and would have taken the film there too.  It would help make things clearer to the audience and help him or her become more in tune with Alex himself.  The ambiguity of Alex's `transformation' is one area that would have been crystal clear had the final chapter been part of the adaptation.  I won't say any more in this regard (read the novel, now released with the final chapter).<br /><br />Regardless though, the film is brilliant.  Aided by the powerhouse (and Oscar snubbed) performance by Malcolm McDowell, who masterfully captures Alex from his outward swagger to his emotional impotence, `A Clockwork Orange' delivers on each and every front.  Stanley Kubrick was a master of film and this is no exception.  This may very well be his finest film, but that is up to each and every one of us to decide for ourselves.</p></body></html>

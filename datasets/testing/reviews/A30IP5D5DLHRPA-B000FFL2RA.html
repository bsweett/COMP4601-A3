Historical nitpicking aside, KOH had it's ups and downs.<br /><br />First off, the movie was slightly long-winded and tended to drag quite a bit so at certain points it was hard to stay focused, however, the dialogue pertaining to religion and extremism was very interesting and very prevelant in our day and age; something that is often overlooked in our mainstream society today.<br /><br />The action sequences were nice; a true testiment to how sword-fighting and medieval warfare was at the time.  The scenes were not overly-grotesue but just right for the occassion so the viewer is not distracted.  The code of honor was not overdone in a hookey over-the-top style like many movies do these days.<br /><br />The acting wasn't bad either; I love Jeremy Irons and Orlanda Bloom and both played characters well suited for their styles of acting.  Some of the other actors and actresses needed a little work here and there, but that's nitpicking.<br /><br />The only real drawbacks I can find is the dragging dialogue in some scenes and not enough action.  For how long the movie is, I was hoping for more battles and less dialogue; for that, I am disapointed but will still be proud to purchase this DVD.<br /><br />All in all, an 89%.</p></body></html>

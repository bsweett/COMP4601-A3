<meta name="summary" content="Borat.  What a Great Laugh!"></head><body><p>Yes, Borat is not politically correct, but who cares?  Borat is funny, in your face and most politically incorrect.<br /><br />Borat Sagdiyev is a television talking head from Kazakhstan played by the very clever Sacha Baron Cohen.  But, what the heck, everyone knows this!  You would have to have been living in a cave not to have at least heard of Borat.<br /><br />The basis of the film is a travelogue of the anarchic Borat travelling across America from east to west ostensibly to film a documentary but also to marry Pamela Anderson.  Along the way, Borat has a series of misadventures.  It is probably the more subtle of these that gave me the biggest laugh.  His thinking that a New York elevator was his hotel room was beautiful.  His shock that a woman could write a book while speaking with a group of feminists was absolutely priceless.  How so many people can be taken in by Borat is simply amazing.  Some people seem to take themselves just a little bit too seriously.<br /><br />If you're going to be offended by nudity or racist humour, steer clear of this film.  If you're willing to roll with the punches, you're in for a great 90 minutes!</p></body></html>

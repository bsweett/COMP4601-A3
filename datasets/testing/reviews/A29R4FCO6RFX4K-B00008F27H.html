The plot was made even worse by the 1983 re-edit, which added 11 minutes to it's already interminable running time. Now director Robert Wise has re-edited the film, tightening the pace, re-inserted key scenes, enhancing effects and supervising a Dolby 5.1 sound mix. And the result? Well, it's still ponderous, plodding and only slightly less protracted. But there are good points though; the principal actors, (Especially William Shatner) are good in their roles, and Jerry Goldsmith's fantastic memorable score helps events, but it's still a so-so movie, that would thankfully be redeemed by the excellent Star Trek II. Not trying to push the point too far, but I fell asleep the first time I watched this lacklustre entry into the Star Trek cannon. The extra material on the DVD bumps up the rating though, with 3 retrospective documentaries with cast and crew interviews, trailers, 8 television commercials, 11 deleted scenes and additional scenes. Also included are storyboard archives and a new Star Trek series Enterprise promo spot.<br />Impressive extras but it's for hard-core Star Trek fans only.</p></body></html>

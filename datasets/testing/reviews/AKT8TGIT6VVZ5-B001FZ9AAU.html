Indeed, it is quite simply the best cinematic adaptation of a comic book character I have seen so far. Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best screen performances as billionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark, whose near-fatal encounter with Afghani terrorists literally leads him towards a new path in life. The supporting cast is just as superb, most notably Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's lovely - and brilliant - assistant Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges as Stark's complicated business partner Obediah Stane. Director Jon Favreau does a fine job handling both the intense, often bloody, action sequences and the more introspective scenes featuring Downey and Paltrow. Of course the special effects are absolutely top notch, courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic.</p></body></html>

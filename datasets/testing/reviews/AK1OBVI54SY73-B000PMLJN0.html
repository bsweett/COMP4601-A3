<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>I really do worry about the future of horror films. I grow more disappointed with every new one I rent out and Dead Silence is the same.<br /><br />Although this looks like a chilling movie it falls flat in its delivery nonetheless. It does have its creepy moments, but nothing that will have you on the edge of your seat. Matter of fact this movie really did not hold my interest for long. It was a lazy and overall very safe horror film. 13 years olds will love it- but us older horror fans will find this yet another story that sounds promising yet in the end feel once again that we have wasted both our time and money. I do not recommend it.<br /><br />2/5</p></body></html>

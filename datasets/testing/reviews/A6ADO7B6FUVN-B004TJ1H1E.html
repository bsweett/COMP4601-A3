The two musicians must skip town to save their lives and they decide to join a female band that is going to Florida.  This is where Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon) appear.  On the train ride to Florida they both meet Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) who they both find immensely attractive, but their situation does not allow them to openly express their feelings for her.  Some Like It Hot is an interesting film because it flirts with issues of homosexuality, but also gender identity.  The structure of the film conceals these issues in a clever manner, since it would probably not be very politically correct to address these issues in 1959 when homosexuality was considered a mental illness by doctors and mental health professionals.  The film is a brilliant comedy that offers many laughs and also pondering for those who need contemplative meditation.</p></body></html>

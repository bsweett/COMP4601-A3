<meta name="summary" content="Appealing Wine Theme, but Not as Funny as It Should Be."></head><body><p>"Sideways" is a "dramedy" based on the novel of the same name by Rex Pickett. There is more drama than comedy, though, as middle-aged pals Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) set off on a week-long trip through California wine country just before Jack is to be married. Miles is a wine fanatic -connoisseur would be an understatement- intent on sending his friend off "in style" by guiding him through the finest wines California has to offer. Jack has other ideas. He wants to sow his wild oats before plunging into matrimony, and he thinks Miles should do the same. Miles has been morose, self-deafeatist, and uncomfortable around the opposite sex since his divorce 2 years before. Through their adventures, they meet two women: Maya (Virginia Madsen), a soulful old acquaintance of Miles who enjoys wine as much as he does. And Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who pours wine at vineyard and likes adventure as much as Jack.<br /><br />Every once in a while a "food movie" comes along, but I don't recall ever seeing a "drink movie" before now. "Sideways" is a drink movie, not to be confused with a "drunk movie", although there is a bit of that too. It does for wine what "Big Night" and "Babette's Feast" did for food. Oenophiles will probably enjoy "Sideways" for the passion it expresses for wine. I found the film only mildly comic, though, and the humor generally relies on Miles' neuroses or Jack's insensitivity. "Sideways" fault is that it makes dysfunction its central gag and plot device. Miles is simply not someone you'd want to be around if he were real. The story revolves around the men, but Maya and Stephanie are more interesting characters. "Sideways" is a solid adaptation, but 2 hours of characters who are essentially annoying wears on the audience, even if what they do is amusing.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005 release): Bonus features include 7 deleted scenes, 1 featurette, a theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary. The "Behind-the-Scenes Featurette" (6 minutes) features interviews with the 4 principle actors and director Alexander Payne in which they primarily discuss characters. In the audio commentary, actors Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church joke about their experiences filming  "Sideways". It sounds like they hit the booze before recording the commentary. There is an occasional piece of information in the commentary, but you'd have a hard time finding it amid all the chortling. Subtitles available in English, French, and Spanish.</p></body></html>

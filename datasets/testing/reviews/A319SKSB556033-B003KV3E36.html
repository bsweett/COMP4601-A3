The script for this could not have been more than 10 pages long.<br /><br />I walked out of Rambo in early 2008 feeling a little bit cheated. The credits rolled at 77 minutes and it felt like the film was missing a final act. Stallone said he was on a deadline to deliver the final cut of the movie, and, if given more time, THIS version is what he would have released first time around.<br /><br />Now running 99 minutes (with 11 still swallowed up by credits) we get a bit more character development, and a couple of scene re-arrangements along with a new on-screen title 'John Rambo'. There's not much more than that. The extended character scenes are even more repetitive than they already were featuring annoyingly circular dialogue that seems to go on forever without really going anywhere. The editing over these extended moments is really, really bad too. Lots of fades, lots of mis-matched cross-cutting, little sense of place or timing. Terrible!<br /><br />Rambo (or Fourth Blood as I call it) is, stylistically, a world away from the previous 3 movies. While the others were shot in lovely anamorphic Panavision/JDC-Scope, this one is shot in ugly, cheap, nasty Super-35. There are loads of fake filters too, which make it look like a hack episode of CSI. Stallone could have done better there. But the worst, the absolute worst, worst, worst thing about this film is the overabundance of incredibly fake, totally unconvincing CGI blood effects, which take me out of the film every time. I don't care if Stallone was on a budget and a schedule, he could have sacrificed some of his paycheck to improve this. He claimed the film was intentionally super-violent because that's what war carnage is really like. Fine, good for you. But when he uses dozens of fake CGI deaths it completely ruins and cheapens whatever realism he was aiming for (pun intended).<br /><br />I suppose it's a hard juxtaposition and a sad testament to modern day action film-making where everything is fixed with cheap cheats in post-production, very little is actually there before the camera, and nothing is really made to last. When you compare Rambo to films of the equivalent 10-15 years ago, where most of the action, atmosphere and effects were done in-camera, when you actually felt like you were taken some place authentic and real, it makes you long for a revival of action movies where the action and danger is tangible and not just an afterthought by a lazy director. I find it odd that First Blood director Ted Kotcheff was a 'technical consultant' on Rambo, when there is really no similarity between them. First Blood felt raw and believable, while Rambo feels overly polished (to disguise the numerous faults) and fake.<br /><br />Yes, I am still giving it four stars as I am glad that the Rambo story finally came to a satisfying close and it was good to see him return home once and for all, though one can't help but think that would have happened 25 years sooner if it hadn't been for Sheriff Teasle, but after the realism of Rocky Balboa, Stallone should have delivered something better. He has the ability, but was clearly just seduced by the modern aesthetic and attitude.<br /><br />This Blu Ray features a nice 1080p 2.40:1 picture that brings out all the fakeness of the camera filters and a very, very loud DTS HD-MA sound design. An 84-minute documentary is also included.</p></body></html>

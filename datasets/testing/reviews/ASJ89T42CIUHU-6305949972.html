<meta name="summary" content="Christmas Is The Real Nightmare!"></head><body><p>A great adult animation film!! Tim Burton has blended stop action animation into a world of fantasy that is worthy of watching again and again.<br /><br />Jack Skellington is a long lanky skeleton who exists to inspire a creepy town on Halloween but alas he begins to desire something more. In his explorations he discovers an opening into a Christmas town where life exists with lights, presents and gaiety. Because of the theory that the grass is always greener on the other side our sad Jack feels the need to possess Santa and bring him back to his own dark Halloweentown while Jack becomes the new Santa. The story is great and a darkly humorous slap in the face of our over commercialized Christmas holiday. Along with Jack a cast of interesting characters exist in Halloweentown: Dr. Finklestein (a silly duck like version of Frankenstein), Sally (a lightly sewn together lady who needs a lot of stitches), Mayor (a two faced fatso with constant anxiety), and many others just as entertaining.<br /><br />This film would not be complete had it not been for Danny Elfman's musical score. The background music is really beautiful along the lines of a fairy tale with twists of horror laced in between. The lyrics for the songs are brilliantly poetic in a Halloweentown type of way and you may even find yourself humming a few for days afterwards. This is a must see DVD for every Halloween to come and maybe even the following Christmas just to add some nightmares into the overly sappy day!</p></body></html>

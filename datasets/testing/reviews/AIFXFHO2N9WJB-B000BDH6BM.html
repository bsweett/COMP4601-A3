<meta name="summary" content="Vengeance Will Be Theirs..."></head><body><p>Never underestimate the bonds of family.  That could easily have been the tagline for this terrific revenge/murder mystery.  With "Four Brothers", director John Singleton (2000's "Shaft" remake) takes this mantra to the extreme, showing that no matter what, when the chips are down you can always count on your family to watch your back.<br /><br />After their saintly foster mother (Fionnula Flanagan) is murdered in a convenience store, her adopted sons, two white and two black, come home to pay their respects.  Three out of the four brothers, Jack (Garrett Hedlund), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), are content to believe that what happened was just a case of wrong place/wrong time.  However, oldest brother Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) believes that they should at least try to find who did this, and deliver some punishment.  In their search for answers, the brothers discover that their mom was not just a random killing, but a planned execution that is tied into a vast conspiracy ranging from the Detroit police, to city council, to a local drug kingpin.  Now, the brothers are in a fight to not only bring down those responsible, but also walk away  with their lives intact.<br /><br />The gritty, hard edged violence of "Four Brothers" gives the movie a modern urban western tone, that is nicely balanced by the brothers' bond to one and other.  John Singleton was careful to show that though the oldest brother, Bobby, was hot-headed and wanted vengeance on the killers, words of wisdom from his other brothers prevailed.  Causing him to stay his hand, until all responsible were discovered, and the conspiracy revealed.  A well-written story that takes time to allow the audience connect with the brothers, and feel their deep pain, before engaging in the revenge arc of the story.  This was key, so that the audience wouldn't view the brothers deeds as no better than those responsible for their mother's death.  All of the actors in "Four Brothers" were outstanding, one character I wish they would have developed a little more was that of Detective Green (Terrence Howard), an uncorruptable Detroit police officer, who knows that the brothers are planning vengeance, but is torn between his duty as a cop and his duty as a friend of the family.  The action scenes are fast, intense, and in some cases brutal, but never gratuitous, with only minimal amounts of blood and gore shown.<br /><br />With its focus on strong family bonds, and a think before you shoot mentality, "Four Brothers" rises above your average revenge movie, and is a thoroughly entertaining and engaging film that most people will enjoy.<br /><br />"Four Brothers" is rated R for violence, language, and sensuality.</p></body></html>

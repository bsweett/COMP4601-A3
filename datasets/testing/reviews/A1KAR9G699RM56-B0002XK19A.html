<meta name="summary" content="As the spider spins its web....."></head><body><p>Spiderman 2 presents a whole new picture of the loved spider.  No longer just dealing with the simply intricacies of relationships, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) now has to fix all his relationships, with his best friend, his aunt, and Mary Jane.  As Peter's life gets complex so does the movie with cooler shots and an overall more in depth story.  Dr. Octopus, another enemy born out of the Oscorp Corporation, comes to spoil the fun.  With a tantalizing touch of the trio's triumphant third movie (a lead into the third Spiderman), I would say the movie wrapped itself up in success.  It was very good, and equal if not better than the first as we see the spider behind the mask much more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Like "Superman" this first entry is the best!!!!!"></head><body><p>Released in the summer of 1989, this film rocked at the box-office, MichaelKeaton brought warmth & humanity to not only Bruce Wayne, but Batman as well, Keaton's facial expressions convey that of a wounded soul, Jack Nicholson finally played the role he was born to play as the crazy,off the wall Joker who's gags never get old, especially when he takes over for his deceased boss(Jack Palance)by telling his cronies to think it over after killing one who disagreed with him in a comical way, Nicholson is over the top as Joker, you can tell he had fun here, as he faces off with Batman in the end by displaying a gun that would put "Dirty Harry" to shame, Kim Basinger lends support as Keaton's somewhat girlfriend who is after the story surrounding Batman, & is targeted by the Joker, one of te best scenes that plays on emotions is the flashback scene where Keaton discovers that Jack Napier/Joker was the one responsible for his parents murder, which gets him in a vengence mode, as he destroys Joker's operating compound with the Batmobile, one of Cinema's coolest cars, their showdown at the end is very gothic, but satisfying, its sequel "Batman Returns" was less that perfect, if only they hadn't put Danny DeVito under a ton of makeup, it might have been better, but this one is the best of them all, "Batman Forever" is as good as this one, despite Keaton's absence, but avoid "Batman & Robin" at all costs!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

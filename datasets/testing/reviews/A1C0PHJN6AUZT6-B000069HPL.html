<meta name="summary" content="Couldn't stop laughing!!!"></head><body><p>I love this movie! I worked at a video store during college, and I reccomended this to all kinds of people. It was one of the few movies that everyone could find something to laugh at while watching it. Peter is an average Joe who hates almost everything about his average office job. When his hyptomism goes wrong, he stops caring, and surprisingly does better at work. When his two friends are laid off the three hatch a plan to get some money out of the company, but nothing works out as planned.</p></body></html>

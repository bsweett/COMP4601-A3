Next came a beautifully-rendered overview of the contagion that crushed entire populations and the illusion they called safety, ultimately showing consumerism for what it was in the face of such a terrible tragedy and that caused people to second-guess the cost of shiny baubles while vacuum-sealed off in a consumerist mall Mecca. Next came the picture of desperation as a small group tried to accept how devastating an all-out plague could be while fighting to both find a cure for it and to understand it more aptly, with experimentation leading to our first glimpse of the not-as-monstrous Bub and how viewing zombies as less-than-terrible can turn spectators into monsters of their own. And now, in a world populated by walking teeth and pulses that are sometimes more horrible than the pulseless, we find ourselves in the aptly-titled Land of the Dead.<br /><br />In Land of the Dead we are looking at a community and the establishment of a hierarchical setting, where people still wait on other people and where currency in the form of protection and status still reigns supreme. We see the human condition in that, seeing how the world has changed and how it still remains polished and pampered and understandably contemptuous. You now have the establishment of a small city, complete with the totem of "have" and "not-so-much," and you see how the place is still powered. I liked the fact that the movie went into detail with specific things like this, showing how raiding small towns can be profitable and how fireworks can be just as powerful as a rocket launcher when looked at the right way. While many movies stop at the zombies and the search for the perfect cranial shot (and that is not necessarily a bad thing), these pieces of the overall portrait add a little something extra. And then there's the zombies and the questions that are asked about them.<br /><br />One of the things I REALLY enjoy about the Romero titles is that they take the time to ask questions instead of presenting a nightmare scenario and a sense of terror. While Romero said that some of these issues people point out in the beginning were actually accidents and that he never meant to become a spokesman on relevance hiding behind an undead mask, the movies themselves show how Romero explores different scenarios and how there is thought put into the "why" that most spectators eventually hope to ascertain. I really like the fact that the Dead movies did this and decided to look at the zombie and ask about their behavior, wondering what happens after the dead become something never encountered. I thought that Day of the Dead was where he really seemed to say that he had a feel for the human element and started digging deeply into the "what" of the zombie, distinguishing Romero from many people making undead films in the process. Land of the Dead goes that route as well, postulating about many things included in the zombie dossier that includes their attachment to particular places (as seen in Dawn of the Dead), their attachment to particular items (as seen throughout all the movies), how much of their behavior is an aftereffect triggered by some subconscious clue versus them actually trying to do things (like a zombie trying to understand a gas pump, zombies playing with musical instruments or picking up items like a gun and actually utilizing it), and many more subtle behaviors that are interesting when examined. I think that's the beauty of the Romero projects; he has been building on a foundation created in the first movie and we, as an audience, benefit from that because he doesn't create sequels. Sure, we see society unhinging more and more and we see the way the government falters and how it has band-aids in its stead. We also have the staples of undead films, violence and weapons and commentary on the human condition, but we also have something else that remarks a little on something that feels somewhat like a glimpse into the psychology of the undead. To me, that is a beautiful thing to watch.<br /><br />Different people have different opinions and some people hope for something that will be like the early additions to the Dead series when, in actuality, that could be a step sideways instead. I can understand the want for something of that caliber, and sometimes I think Romero is possibly a victim of his own name. Still, Land of the Dead is a great title and deserves the attention of the zombie lover. They walk slow, think slow, chew slow, and sometimes make the squeamish think about the reality of teeth and the slow grind being eaten by undead multitudes would amount to. I personally love that and the "sky flowers" and the enigma that is the undead mind, thinking the answers could come from no better source than the eye of the Romero himself. Given a chance I think that many others would add this into their collection, too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wasted Talent in an Awful Film"></head><body><p>Nearly every self important pretentious film critic in the country touted this rubbish as a deep thought provoking study of sexuality and human behavior. Simply put though...this movie is horrible and pointless. The characters are awful selfish people only the most shallow human being could find sympthetic, they are nasty and wretched human beings, not the average person in a predicament, but rather botton feeder Jerry Springer trash in nicer clothes. There is no great enlightenment to be found here, I found myself rooting for horrible things to happen to all the characters and after awhile didn't really care what happened to them at all. Ignore all the hoopla about the higher deeper meanings of this film, hell, rubbish like Showgirls was more enlightening than this.</p></body></html>

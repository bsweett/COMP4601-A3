<meta name="summary" content="" If you want somethin', go get it.""></head><body><p>This true story opens in San Francisco in the eighties, where salesman Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is barely able to make ends meet.  His wife (Thandie Newton) gets fed up and leaves, and Chris must juggle a non-paying internship with a brokerage firm with caring for his five-year old son, Christopher (Jaden Smith). With no income, Chris and Christopher go from cheap apartment to cheaper motel and eventually become homeless.<br /><br />I waited a long time to see this movie because I thought it would be sugary-sweet and corny, but it's not; it's realistic and scary, heartwarming, and inspiring.  Smith portrays Chris as an intelligent, hardworking, and extremely likeable man who sees his world crumble around him.  He gives a truly memorable performance.  His real-life son Jaden is also wonderful as the plucky little boy who rolls with the punches and loves his dad no matter what.<br /><br />This film about a father's descent into homelessness is full of frustration, tempered with the innocence and resilience of the little son.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

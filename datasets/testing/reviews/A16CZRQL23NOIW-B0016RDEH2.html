<meta name="summary" content="The so long expected "magic realism" carried to screen!"></head><body><p>The myth and fable shake hands in this bloody and horrid chapter of a recent story at the front of war where rebel troops and military forces try to establish its hegemony.<br /><br />An innocent and sensitive child, who loves the fairy tales, open her senses to unconsciousness and so, to build a link between myth and reality, as a visible attempt of lyrical evasion and visceral commitment: She ignores it, but she is the chosen, the materialization of an old fable about a princess who never returned her kingdom.<br /><br />Once you visit the Archeological Museum of Mexico city you will aware why the myth and the legend literally floats and hover all that country.  And if you think it carefully, it just could not be other way: Mexico, the land which was witness of years of legends and ancestral myths, of first rate poets and outstanding thinkers, the same nation from whose entrails emerged Frida Kahlo, Carlos Fuentes and Octavio Paz; who gave shelter to several exiled personalities Trotsky, Eisentein and Bu&ntilde;uel).<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth is the embodiment of a long expected project that nestled under the mythical imagination of countless generations; an epic fable against the intolerance; a powerful warning about what's right and what's wrong.<br /><br />Like the primordial seeds of the mythical essence, a generation must die and that baby will represent, the seed of hope and the final outcome of so many shred blood, but enrooted and narrated with such conviction and expressive force that literally will capture our senses and unconsciousness with all the possible vigor.<br /><br />A real triumph of what cinema can do; and an additional evidence about Jean Epstein's statement: the core of all movie has a basic psychic nature.<br /><br />Don' t let this movie pass in front of you; leave your rational world and drive yourself in this hallucinating and superb visual spectacle.</p></body></html>

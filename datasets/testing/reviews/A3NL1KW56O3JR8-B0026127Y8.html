Once you get past the first 30 minutes where they make a poor attempt and developing the characters and building conflict, the movie kicks into high gear. At least they don't make any lame attempts at making the movie more than it really is: 60 minutes of Neeson taking out everybody who gets in his way. Nothing cute or clever here, just methodical execution of all the bad guys.</p></body></html>

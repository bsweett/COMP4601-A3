The concept that you can't cheat Death was done in a relatively new way. Final Destination 2 was also pretty good....It was a good sequel but a lot of the suspense that the first one had was gone because you pretty much were familiar enough with the concept to know that Death was coming fast and ugly for those that cheated It.<br /><br />Final Destination 3 had almost 0 suspense. You knew what would happen to everyone that cheated Death in the initial scene...it was just a matter of what kind of grotesque accident would befall the cheaters.<br /><br />Death and gore lovers will have a field day with Final Destination 3. There's all kinds of death and mutilation. The initial, well-publicized roller coaster scene is worth the price of admission. But the movie follows the roller coaster scene with a very predictable pattern of building up to the next gruesome death with some torturous B acting. It was easier to watch the deaths than the acting in between the deaths.<br /><br />The Final Destination formula is worn out and old. If you don't need a good movie to back your craving for blood, then you will enjoy Final Destination 3. Otherwise, perhaps wait for late night cable to waste your time.</p></body></html>

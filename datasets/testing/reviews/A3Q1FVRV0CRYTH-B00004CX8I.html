Jack Nicholson in his oscar winning performance as R.P. McMurphy chanels everything that makes Jack the actor he is for a once in a lifetime performance.  McMurphy has five accounts of assault and is facing jail time, so he decides that a term in a mental ward has got to be better than the pen, so he fakes insanity (sort-of) so he can serve his sentence in different suroundings.  Once in the door though, it's not so easy to leave again.  He has to face down Nurse Ratched (Louse Fletcher in a very tame, subdued yet powerful performance that also won her the oscar) and Nurse Ratched is not easily persuaded...just watch the debate over watching the world series.  There are many scenes in this film that are staples in movie history, many scenes that stand out as what movies are supposed to be, and the acting on all fronts is spot-on.  A young Danny DeVito plays the innocent and playful Martini, and Christopher Lloyd in his first roll plays the very memerable Taber.  But it's, of course, Jack Nicholson that steals every scene, although I have to say that Sydney Lassick as Cheswick was some very hard competition...he was perfect in his role...just watch his tantrum over cigarettes.  Anyways, this is one of those films you should be required to see, but your not so many may not have seen it...I just hope that after reading this review you'll go out and rent it ASAP.  This film is more than just a film about crazies, it's a film about responcibility and maturity, and you can see that as the film progresses and McMurphy realizes that being sane doesn't mean your being smart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderfully moving, well written, well acted film."></head><body><p>Juno is a well acted smartly written film about every dad's nightmare. Having your brilliant underachieving daughter tell you she is pregnant well (knock on wood), that is one thing every Dad is terrified of.<br />So from the onset, I was resistant to buying or watching this film.<br /><br />Although I am still not sure that I want my youngest teen to watch this film, I found it to be one of the most moving and entertaining films I've seen in a long time, as the director and cast managed to make my wife and I feel something about every character in the film, which for me is quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />It is my opinion that Juno deserved all of the accolades it has received, it is a very, very good film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="With a star for the acting."></head><body><p>The acting in thie film is superb. At least 3 Oscar-worthy performances (especially Ben Kingsley), and the rest were close as well. That alone is reason to watch this. However as a film, while it's more then compelling -- you need to know how things will wrap up -- it also has an unrealistic/semi-fantastic side that ultimately injures the plot permanently. Not something to watch if you're easily depressed, for sure.</p></body></html>

With "Vertigo", however, Hitchcock creates a masterpiece that transcends most of his other films and takes his directing to a whole new level.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Vertigo" tells the story of Mr. Ferguson (James Stewart), a one-time detective whose fear of heights (or vertigo) now keeps him grounded.  However, when a close friend hires Ferguson to track the whereabouts of his wife (played by Kim Novak), Ferguson is pulled into a web of intrigue and the paranormal far deeper than he could ever imagine, even to the point of having to finally confront the fear that cripples him inside.<br /><br />There is nothing I can nit-pick about this film.  Period.  It is truly a cinematic masterpiece that hits all the right buttons.  The plot is infinitely engaging, and filled with enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the ending credits.  The characters are well-acted and progress in interested ways as the reels keep spinning, making you actually care what happens to Stewart and Novak's characters.  Then, of course, there is the direction from Hitch, who ties everything together perfectly with his mix of unique film techniques (using Technicolor in ways it had likely never been used before), interesting visual angles, and fast-paced, yet at the same time touching, plot angles.<br /><br />Like I said, within a few minutes (once Hitch makes his ubiquitous cameo), you'll never have that nagging feeling that this movie is only good because Hitch's name is attached to it.  Instead, you'll be completely drawn into everything unfolding in front of you, perhaps even needing to be reminded at the end that it was a Hitchcock film in the first place.<br /><br />Thus, I consider "Vertigo" to be not only Hitchcock's best film, but also one of the best films of all-time.  It just doesn't do anything wrong, and does oh so many things right.</p></body></html>

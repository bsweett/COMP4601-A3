<meta name="summary" content="A good story..."></head><body><p>The dire results of plagiarism cannot get any worse in this taut thriller, adapted from a story by the modern master of terror, Stephen King. Johnny Depp's performance as an author of some renown, the cuckold husband in the midst of a sticky divorce, attempting to write again, is a smooth mixture of light comedy, witty one-liners and an experienced sense of the dramatic, rendered with unconscious precision. This popular American actor is at the top of his form because he makes it look so easy.<br /><br />When this picture first hit the big screen, practitioner-critics from around the world agreed that it had the potential to be a very good film, but settled for something much less. The problem, they believed, was an identity problem: it couldn't decide whether to be a dramatic comedy or a serious thriller - it attempted to achieve both and failed on all counts. It was said as well that Depp is the film's only saving grace, and without his name and talent, its box office run should not have lasted more than a few days. I couldn't disagree more. Depp's performance certainly carried the film along, but the overall editing, creative and tight, and the soundtrack by Phillip Glass, reminiscent of old Hitchcock films, provided enough atmospheric suspense to ensure the audience remained riveted from start to finish.<br /><br />Secret Window did not set out to be original, reach any box office records or change the face of filmmaking. It is simply a good story, adapted to the screen for the single purpose to entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously nor did the filmmaker's intend it to be taken as such. Depp appeared to have a good time making the film and a lot of us had a good time watching it, too. Well worth the time and few bucks.</p></body></html>

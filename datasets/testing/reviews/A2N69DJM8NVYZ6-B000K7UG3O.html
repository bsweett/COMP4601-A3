When Tripp get "the look" from another girlfriend, he lets them dump him by brining them to his parents' house. His parents decide to hire a professional girlfriend for Tripp who ensures them that he will move out, but instead, they fall in love. The plot of the movie is predictable, the movie is funny, and it's kind of the movie you should see with you girlfriend/boyfriend.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrific animated feature"></head><body><p>A visually arresting 3D animated adventure about a young man who has grown up as a bit of a misfit in a Viking village. He has a strained relationship with his Father, the tribe's chief, because of his lack of physical gifts. During the course of the film, he encounters the most feared dragon species, befriending the creature. The film is engaging, funny, exciting, and the animation is top notch. This is an outstanding piece of work.</p></body></html>

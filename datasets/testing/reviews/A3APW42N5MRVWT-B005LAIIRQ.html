<meta name="summary" content="And it wasn't even marketed as Science Fiction"></head><body><p>A group of men work at an outpost where they draw natural resources from a planet (oil, I believe, in this case). Liam Neeson is a sniper who picks off the local predators when they attack. Some of the men are flying back to their primary settlement called Anchorage, I assume it is so named because the outline of the landmass is remarkably similar to that of Alaska. Their transport crashes in a frozen wilderness. They are beset by the predators which bear a superficial physical resemblance to wolves. The men even call them "wolves". These aren't very creative people.<br /><br />The story of how the survivors of the crash persevere is well made and includes some very good scenes. Overall though, it's a pretty stupid movie. The animated/animatronic creatures aren't especially credible. And it's pretty obvious the reason these predators are attacking is that the humans have wiped out their natural prey - after all they are the only non-human creatures we see in an entire two hour movie that takes place entirely out doors. As a survey of varieties of ways to die, though, it's pretty thorough.</p></body></html>

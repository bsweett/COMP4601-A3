Evans, who also wrote the screenplay for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G89G4">Stand By Me (Deluxe Edition)</a> which earned him an Oscar nod.<br /><br />Costner plays Mr. Brooks a successful self made business man who just earned man of the year and an efficient serial killer that battles with his inner demons; one takes the form of Marshall played by William Hurt.  Brooks thinks before he speaks and knows how to say the right thing in a soothing way that makes everything seem like it's not that bad.  At times you find yourself rooting for him or nervous for him as viewers did in the character Norman Bates in Psycho as the car stops sinking into the bog and we are nervous for him, although we don't worry as much about Mr. Brooks we still somewhat like him.<br /><br />If that wasn't enough Brooks gets blackmailed by Mr. Smith (Dane Cook) who wants him to teach him to be a killer all while being pursued by the nothing to lose cop (Demi Moore) and dealing with family issues.<br /><br />Fans of serial killer films Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer, Silence of the Lambs, American psycho or the show Dexter should enjoy and Costner's character is still unique.  Also for people that like their films without a ton of hidden symbolism, Mr. Brooks is pretty straight forward although you could analyze Costner's character thoroughly as well.</p></body></html>

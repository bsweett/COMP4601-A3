<meta name="summary" content="Funniest movie ever"></head><body><p>It is well-known that the Pythons themselves believe &quot;Life of Brian&quot; is their best movie.  In terms of production value, it probably is, but it's not nearly as funny as &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail.&quot;  Made on a shoestring budget and played absolutely straight by the troupe, it is hilarious and intellegent at the same time, as well as being charmingly rustic (due to the low budget).<p>The late Graham Chapman plays Arthur, and is perfect in the role.  He is always dignified and noble, even while taking insults from ludicrously-accented Frenchmen.  All the other Pythons have multiple speaking parts - a special highlight for me is Terry Jones as the whining prince.  The Pythons are at their pseudo-intellectual best in this, their first feature film.  My favourite part is Arthur's argument with the peasants making up the anarcho-syndicalist commune (&quot;You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!&quot;), followed closely by the opening scene of the film, where it's revealed that Arthur is not riding a horse but has a servant following him making horse-noises with a coconut (&quot;Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?&quot;).<p>The DVD is packed with nifty extras.  There are two making-of features, one made while the film was in production (by the BBC) the other made just recently.  The latter features Terry Jones and Michael Palin travelling through the country reminiscing and visiting the old locations (don't worry - it's better than it sounds!).  Most importantly, the DVD looks fantastic, and the sound is good as well, and if you're still trying to figure out what the characters are saying, you have several subtitle-caption options.  There are numerous other extras, including a version of the song &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; with animated Lego figures - hilarious!<p>For Monty Python fans, this DVD is an absolute must, and I recommend it most highly to everyone else!</p></body></html>

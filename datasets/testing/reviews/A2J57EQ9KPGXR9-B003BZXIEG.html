<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Film - Great Special Effects"></head><body><p>It was worth the price of the ticket to see Kelsey Grammar portray the Beast, the blue-skinned, fur covered X-Men with a several advanced degrees. It was a perfect piece of casting. Most of the cast from the previous X-Men film are in Last Stand, one notable exception is NightCrawler (my personal favorite) and a few old favorites were added: Angel, Colossus, Kitty Pryde.<br /><br />The special effects were great, this time around the audience gets to see characters like Magneto, Storm and Jean Grey really go "all out" with their powers. Hugh Jackman puts in another great performance as Wolverine as well.<br /><br />Some X-Men fans will be upset over the various plot lines taken from comics and jumbled into this film but Last Stand will entertain most X-Men fans and non-fans alike.</p></body></html>

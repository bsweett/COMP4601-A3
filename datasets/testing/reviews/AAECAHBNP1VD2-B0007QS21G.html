<meta name="summary" content="An incredibly easy film to sum up...."></head><body><p>Special effects are absolutely amazing.<br />Acting and screenplay border on abyssmal. Several actors (Ward, PLummer, Holm, even Quaid)were pretty much wasted. Much of it was predictable. It's very watchable, but do be aware it's definitely cloying/gagging/clicje Hollywood in spots. Sam comes off as a grinning simpleton with occasional flashes of semi-brilliance. The scene of the freighter sailing down Fifth Ave. is engaging. Seriously, more detailed and prolonged destruction scenes would've added a lot. After all, isn't FX what these films are all about?</p></body></html>

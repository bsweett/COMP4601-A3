<meta name="summary" content="Get Shorty instead"></head><body><p>I haven't read Elmore Leonard's follow up to Get Shorty, so I am unsure of how closely the movie follows the novel.  But what we have here in the movie is actors trying too hard to make you laugh.  It's a funny set up that's not executed right.<br /><br />Chili Palmer, having left the Shylock business to produce movies in Get Shorty has...left the movie business to produce music in Be Cool.  However, the music business is just as cut throat as the movie business apparently as Chili finds himself the target of a gang, the Russian mafia, crooked music execs, a gay body guard (the Rock who is probably the only truly funny person in the movie), and a hitman.<br /><br />If you've seen Get Shorty, this will seem very familiar.  And that's because it is.  The only difference is that instead of being in the movie industry, we're in the music industry and instead of being consistently funny, we are only semi-funny, some of the time.<br /><br />There are a couple homages to the first movie, bill boards, Danny Devito's character, and similar situations (like Uma and Travolta waking up in the middle of the night because they hear the TV on downstairs), so it was kind of fun to catch those little touches.<br /><br />I'm really at a loss of what to say, it's kind of like when they made the Whole Ten Yards, they are trying too hard to be just like the original that they fall flat.  For those who haven't seen Get Shorty, it MIGHT be better.  For those who have seen Get Shorty, I wouldn't bother with this movie.  The best way I can describe this movie is that it's Get Shorty if Get Shorty weren't directed or written by the same people.  And the people that wrote it weren't very funny.  It's a shame because with all the talent that's in the movie, you'd think it'd click.</p></body></html>

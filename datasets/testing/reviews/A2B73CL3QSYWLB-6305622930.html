<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Portrait of a Soldier"></head><body><p>Reading a lot of the reviews to this film the writers appear to be students of World War II.  I am not personally but I can attest to the excellence of this film probably because I viewed "Patton" more as a character study than as a war film per se.  For sure director Franklin J.Schaffner stages the war footage magnificently.  Where this film succeeds is twofold.  Firstly in the terrific script by a young Francis Ford Coppola and a later assist by Edmund North.  By focusing on George S. Patton and explaining the contradictions that were the man Coppola and North have crafted a portrait of a warrior whose actions would deceive you into thinking he was a warmonger.  Secondly you have an absolutely spellbinding performance by George C. Scott.  Scott has you mesmerized throughout and your eyes never leave him despite the bombast that surrounds him.  For sure Scott demonstrates the maverick side of the man but he is equally effective in the quieter pensive side of Patton.  Do yourself a favor and listen to the commentary track by Coppola.  Coppola offers insight into the genesis of the project and has the forbearance to be quiet during crucial moments in the film.</p></body></html>

I am unsure as to why this is, though I have my theories, but irregardless of how offensive the subject matter of some religious thrillers may be to certain groups, Hollywood can't help but release more and more semi-blasphemous or full-out blasphemous material.  Now, as a Christian I can still watch these movies, viewing them for what they are, fiction, plus my faith is strong enough to not be shaken by any work of fiction.  So, when I heard that Ron Howard (director of "Apollo 13" and "A Beautiful Mind") would be directing an adaptation of Dan Brown's best-selling novel "The Da Vinci Code" and the film would star Tom Hanks ("Castaway" and "Forrest Gump"), I was intrigued since I am a fan of both the director and the star.  I had heard about the controversy surrounding this movie and the novel that inspired it, but I had heard from other movie-goers that this adaptation steered away from the more blasphemous material from the novel, and presented a more balanced view of the theory that Jesus was married to Mary Magdelene and may have sired a child (again this is a theory, and one I do not believe is true in any way).  I have to admit that even though I heard this movie would possibly be blasphemous, I wanted to watch it and see for myself, plus in truth, I have been a fan of numerous movies that weren't exactly faithful in their depictions of Christianity or Catholicism, I was able to view them as works of fiction and enjoy them; examples would be "End of Days" and "Constantine".  The question is however, can I do it for this movie, knowing that the intention of the author, Dan Brown, was to try to disrupt people's faith in God by presenting this theory that is not even remotely supported by any real evidence, merely a painting done by Leonardo Da Vinci serves as the only basis for the theory.<br /><br />"The Da Vinci Code" follows a Harvard Professor of Symbology named Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) who has been summoned to the Louvre to decode a bizarre series of clues at a murder scene.  When Langdon arrives he is warned that he is the primary suspect in the murder, and is then aided by a Cryptologist named Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou).  With French police tracking their every movements, Robert and Audrey are trying desperately to survive and still unravel the ever-expanding mystery surrounding the murder.  A mystery that involves a secret from the time of Jesus, that if proven true could shatter the very faith of Christianity.<br /><br />For some reason, even though this was a high-profile movie for Hollywood due to its subject matter, critics blasted the movie, as basically being too self-important, poorly acted and executed, and just completely boring.  This came as a shock to me, because critics love movies that blast religion, and the religious thrillers that critics hate, I generally love because that means they're not as one sided as the critics had hoped.  So with that thought, I was even more excited to see "The Da Vinci Code", and see what all of the fuss was about.  Well, I have to say that I have to agree with the critics on this movie, not completely, but mostly.<br /><br />I felt the movie tried to hard to be such an 'important' movie, especially in the last half hour, that it really brings the movie to a screeching halt.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 hours of "The Da Vinci Code", but once the murder/mystery aspect of the movie was wrapped up, which by the way would have been a perfect stopping point and would have provided a much stronger movie, but the last half hour completely ruined the movie experience for me.  Over the course of the first 2 hours the theory of Christ having a wife was presented, but evidence refuting the theory was also presented, both sides getting equal share, which was interesting to watch, but in the last half hour only the theory is given screen time and the movie veers heavily into the blasphemy arena.  As far as the actors performances were concerned, I thought that both lead actors, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, did excellent jobs in their respective roles.  The true star of the movie was Sir Ian McKellan's character, which most critics agree with me on that statement, he was really enjoying his role in the movie, and the scenes with him and Tom Hanks arguing back and forth over the validity of the theory were a joy to witness.  I felt the directing was solid, which is no surprise since Ron Howard was at the helm, and from what I hear, it was his decision to tone down the more blasphemous parts from the novel and present a more balanced perspective.  The way Ron Howard chose to portray Robert's ability to decipher code was interesting, yet very reminiscient of the way Russell Crowe's character understood numbers in Ron's earlier work "A Beautiful Mind", which made me kind of let down that he wasn't more original and chose to copy himself.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the majority of this movie, the last half hour was especially weak and ruined the movie for me.  I do believe the movie is worth watching once, especially the entertaining first 2 hours, but after the movie wrapped with the dismally boring final 30 minutes, I did feel as if I had wasted my time, and would have enjoyed it much more if the movie would have ended with the conclusion of the murder mystery.<br /><br />"The Da Vinci Code" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="good film"></head><body><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't THIS the movie where Julia Roberts really became the great movie actress that we think of today?  The movies I've seen released before this one starring Julia Roberts show an actress on the verge of greatness, but never quite reaching that point for whatever reason.<br /><br />Well, Erin Brockovich is definitely a movie I have no problem calling fantastic.  Perhaps it's the memories of when the film came out and how I remember my family really enjoying how Julia's character develops into a strong and intelligent woman, or perhaps it has more to do with the writing of the story, which is both interesting AND moving.  Not to mention the kind of storyline anyone of any age can understand and appreciate.<br /><br />I will always remember Erin Brockovich as the movie that got me into paying more attention to movies as a whole more than anything else, and I recommend everyone watch it at least once and see if you too are able to discover the same kind of enjoyment that me and my family once did.<br /><br />This is also an important movie that women should take notice of, because it shows women can do absolutely anything if they set their minds to it.  I believe Erin Brockovich sets an example for everyone though, men and women alike, to stand up for what you believe in.</p></body></html>

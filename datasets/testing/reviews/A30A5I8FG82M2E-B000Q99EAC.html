<meta name="summary" content="Mr. Balboa - What a REAL Man"></head><body><p>In this day and age of "equal rights" for all orientations, it is highly refreshing to see such an old-fashioned macho man like Rocky Balboa.  I am quite a fan of Mr. Stallone and his Rocky series, and found Adrian (his wife) to be a strong feminist-type presence.  It is no secret that she is no longer with us, and I worried my well-fed rear off that her absence would hurt the movie.  Not so, as Mr. Stallone handles her passing with great sensitivity - never letting the audience forget how much that tigress meant to him.<br /><br />As a confirmed neo-feminist, I find it perfectly acceptable to desire a strong ol' guy while also maintaining my own identity. The reason, I think, that so many people ended up wanting to see this movie is because in these overly sensitive "politically correct" times, there is a strong appeal in seeing such a straight-ahead tough guy who knows what he wants and how he plans to get it without ever compromising who he is nor conceding to the societal pressures that force so many to sell out their own personal integrity.<br /><br />I was a little iffy regarding the character of Marie.  While I applaud Stallone for resisting temptations to fire up a romance between he and Marie, I also felt he was a little too fatherly in his attempts to control her life.  Bravo to her for telling him that he was offering too much, but boo to her for ending up accepting such help.  Not really a part of the neo-femme credo.  Her son Steps was also a little ineffective and wasn't seen learning many lessons in masculinity from Rocky.<br /><br />Back to the subject of grieving a lost spouse, while I have never experienced that harsh reality - I have relatively recently split with a male companion (shouldn't the term 'boyfriend' end with the onset of middle age?). I was heartbroken and remain very depressed as I feel lonely (not to mention that my biological clock is about to stop ticking, and no amount of winding is likely to restart it).  Watching this movie, I was reminded of the type of love I have been close to many times yet somehow have managed to miss. Why are some of us so unlucky? Don't I deserve my own Rocky Balboa??<br /><br />Thank you for indulging me in such a personal take on this movie. I dare not spoil anything about the big fight, but for me it was not all that important.  Stallone crafted an excellent character study and by the time the training sequence begins it is almost beside the point. Not a criticism mind you, it is in fact a huge compliment to the first 70 or so minutes of the movie.  Did I cry?  Yes.  Did I wet myself?  Only a little because of the gargantuan soda I drank throughout the movie.  Kudos to Mr. Stallone, God bless him.</p></body></html>

It does have some funny parts in it but it is just to dull for my taste.<br /><br />Plot: Tula has always done what her mother & father wanted her to do(Espicaily her dad) and she is thirty and unmarried. her father wants her to marry a greek man because of her heritage and belives. but when she meets Ian things change big time. can her dad handle the pressure of his little gile having her own free will. well you'll find out when you rent it.<br /><br />If you liked this film check out,<br />1.

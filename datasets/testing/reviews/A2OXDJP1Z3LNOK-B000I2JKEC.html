<meta name="summary" content="A blockbuster that stands up to the test of kryptonite."></head><body><p>It had been years since I had seen Superman.  So, I rented this one as a trip of nostalgia.  I was blown away by just how good this movie is so many years later.  Is there anyone more perfect to play the man of steel that Christopher Reeve?<p>Let this movie be a lesson to those who make movies like Spawn, Tomb Raider..., a movie must have more than explosions are special effects.  Superman is that movie.  It captures the grandness of childlike memories of superheroes without the use of  cliche.  <p>This is one to own for sure.  A super movie.</p></body></html>

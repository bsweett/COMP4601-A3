<meta name="summary" content="Savmart Made a Huge Mistake......"></head><body><p>....when they gired Seymour&quot;Sy the Photo Guy&quot; Parrish to work in the store. Sy is the main character in the movie One Hour Photo which is one of the greatest thrillers in this time period. <p>I recently rented One Hour Photo after months and months of waiting for it to come on video. The only flaw with this movie is that it felt like it was 96 seconds long. In reality the movie is 96 minutes long. After seeing it on video I decided that I really wanted to see it again. Therefore I bought it and watched it again today. It felt as if the movie got better the second time I saw it. Well mabey not better. The word that I should have used was &quot;still excellant.&quot; It didn't have the element of surprise when I watched it today but it was still great. <p>The thing that makes the movie what it is is the premise. It has a fantastic orignal storyline. People have stalked people and became obbessed with people from seeing them and talking to them. Nobody ever thought about the people who find out things about other people's lives through there picture. What a fantastic element of thriller Mark Romanek(the writer and director of One Hour Photo) thought up with. <p>Lighting gave the mood of the movie. The lighting was also always different with diffeent kinds of sets. When you saw the photo lab it was very white, when you saw Sy's fantasies about the family he loves it is colorful and happy. When you see the reality of the family it is a little bit colorful but also a little dark. When you saw what Sy did towards the end it was extremly dark. <p>The score was the last thing that the crew of the movie did that wowed me. The music was perfect to this type of movie. Those of you who have seen the movie might know about the music being played when Sy is running in the hotel. It was just fantastic and pretty soon I saw myself humming the theme of that music.<p>Finally the plot. I have talked about everything that has been showen in the movie except the plot. The film opens with Sy(Robin Williams) caught. I never approved of flashback stories...especially in a thriller. In this movie you know that Sy gets caught by the police in the end. That is a minor flaw that all movies that do that have. Sy starts his story with the Yorkins. Nina Yorkin(Commie Nielson) loves taking picture of her son Jake(Dylan Smith) and her husband Will(Michael Vartan). She gets them devopled at the local Savmart where Yoshi and his co worker Sy work. Sy have developed the Yorkins picture since Jake was a baby and eventually thinks that he is part of the family or &quot;Uncle Sy&quot; Nina and Jake like Sy but not as much as Sy likes them. Sy thinks that the Yorkins are the perfect family but he doesn't know that Nina and Will fight about money issues and Jake hears them fighint. Sy thinks of Jake as his nephew and gives him a free disponisble camera for his birthday which just pasts. Nina doesn't know the dedication that Sy puts into the family's photo's more then anyone eles's.But with his contact with the family in the store(at the lab and in the store's isle's when Will goes shopping there)the store's manenger Bill Owens(Gary Cole) becomes increasly concerned with Sy. Bill lays Sy off which is the first thing that gets Sy angry. The raging point of Sy is when he finds out that Will is having an affair with Maya Burson(Erin Daniels). Not to ruin anything in between that and the eventual involment with police detective James Van Der Zee(played fantasticly by Eriq La Salle)<p>Hopefully you have notices that this is a great movie by reading my plot and my reveiw. Of course you have to see the entire movie to really appriciate it.<p>ENJOY!</p></body></html>

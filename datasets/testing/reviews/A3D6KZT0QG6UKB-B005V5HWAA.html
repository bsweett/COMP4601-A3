But part of me was always hoping that he'd climb back on that horse. This is similar to the 1980s Steve Martin.<br /><br />What I like about this movie is that the director manages to use Kevin Costner's main weakness to his advantage. Kevin Costner has been compared to Jimmy Stewart since his first role. However, that Jimmy Stewart persona conveyed a certain amount of arrogance as time wore on. He was still doing the "Gee Shucks Ma'am" routine but you didn't buy it. So having Kevin Costner playing a very well hidden serial killer is genius. That's the bit that's been off all this time. He's really evil.<br /><br />And even better is Dane Cook's role. He's one of those divisive comedians in that for every one person that loves him, there are about 3 that want to punch him in the mouth. As the serial killer tag-along (the one that witnesses the murders but gets off on them) he's the perfect foil as the funny guy that you just want to hurt badly. And oh does he ever get hurt.<br /><br />Oh and William Hurt as Kevin Costner's Mr. Snuffalupagus - awesome in so many ways. William Hurt is usually pretty bland for me, but what better companion to Kevin Costner than a slightly bland but ultimately malevolent character?<br /><br />Beyond that, it's a fairly taut thriller with enough surprises to keep you going. There are many silly moments such as Demi Moore's multi-millionaire police woman and the weird subplot about Costner's daughter but you pretty much expect silly moments when you have a serial killer movie.  Oh and the plot tries to incorporate all these elements and a few other serial killers that Demi Moore has to chase down (as well as an ex-husband that wants her money) and it all comes together at the end - more or less. It's still an enjoyable ride.</p></body></html>

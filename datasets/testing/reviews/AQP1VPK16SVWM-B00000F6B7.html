<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Trek films"></head><body><p>The success of Wrath of Khan caught Paramount by surprise. The budget was scaled down after the expensive ST:TMP and expectations were down as well. Nicholas Meyer and Harve Bennett made the right move; they went after a classic Trek episode (Gene Coon's &quot;Space Seed&quot;)and recognized a great villian to play against Kirk in Khan. <p>Admiral Kirk has stepped down from &quot;the chair&quot; yet again and is involved in Star Fleet's Academy training. Captain Spock's latest class will be training on the Enterprise and Kirk's going along for the ride along with McCoy and the core of his seasoned crew. <p>Meanwhile, on planet Seti 5 Chekov has transported down to a barren, desolate world racked by sand storms strong enough to strip skin from bone. He and the captain of a Federation science vessel are checking for life on the planet. It seems that Kirk's ex Carol Marcus and her son David have designed a terraforming &quot;bomb&quot; that literally creates life from destruction; it changes any planet it strikes into a thriving planet with living plants within a matter of days. This revoltionary approach has drawbacks; any planet &quot;Genesis&quot; strikes will produce life but it will destroy any pre-existing life forms. So Chekov and his captain are forced to investigate the planet to rule out any chance that there is life.<p>Unfortunately, the only life forms on Seti Alpha 5 are ghosts from Kirk's past. Khan, the genetically engineered superhuman Kirk encounter twenty some years before, was deposited on the planet with his followers. Evidently, Seti-Alpha 6 the planet they were marooned on by Kirk was thrown into a new orbit when one of the other planets exploded. It changed the atmosphere from paradise to poison. Khan's ticked off and wants revenge. He sees &quot;Genesis&quot; as a means to an end--it will be bait to lure Kirk to him and allow him to kill his enemy at the same time.<p>While traveling with Spock on the cadet training mission, Kirk gets a desperate call  Carol Marcus. Marcus received a message from Chekov that Star Fleet intended to take Genesis away from Marcus and her research team before they've had a chance to try it on a planet wide scale. She had been told this was done at Kirk's command. Kirk, perplexed, tries to reason with her but communication is lost. Suddenly, the Enterprise and her crew are going to be thrown into harm's way with a madman waiting for them.<p>Meyer's only previous movie was the strong time travel film Time After Time. He wasn't familiar with Trek. That was his advantage. His take on Trek was Hortiao Hornblower in outer space. Meyer, Bennett and screenwriter Jack Soward moved action back into the Trek universe with a tale of revenge and rivalry. Wrath of Khan stands as one of the best Trek  films produced.<p>This Director's Special Edition features the extended version that Meyer had wanted to release originally. It includes many new scenes and a couple of minor subplots (such as Scotty's nephew surviving on the Enterprise which gives a new meaning to one particular shot near the end)restored to the film. The beautifully transferred DVD is in anamorphic widescreen (which basically means that the way it was transferred allows for more resolution and better clarity particularly for progressive scan DVD players and widescreen televisions). There's very few problems with the picture and the sound is stunning particularly when compared to the earlier laserdisc and DVD versions. The first disc also includes a fascinating running commentary from Meyer and Trek factoids that appear on screen. They range from interesting to funny as heck. The text display is particularly interesting after you've watched the movie the first time to capture all the action. They provide interesting tidbits about the production of the film itself as well.<p>The second disc features all the extras with the exception of Meyer's commentary track. There's a number of great featurettes that provide a wealth of background on how the film came to be, Meyer's involvement and the cast &amp; crew's take on the finished product. There's also a section devoted to the ILM optical effects, publicity materials and trailers. <p>There's also a booklet listing the chapters, special features and a nice picture of the original cast included (something Paramount neglected to include for Star Trek VI--shame on you Paramount!). Although there are some minor science errors, they're easy to overlook as the action and entertainment value of the film exceptional. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting premise, but its no "Minority Report""></head><body><p>This film intrigued me because of the interesting premise about a robot accused of murder, which is something it supposedly cannot do.  That's because there are three laws that govern the internal programming of robots...one being that they cannot kill a human being, that their job is to protect human life.  So, the film hooks you by an intriguing premise then reels you in until they pull a switch on you (that old "bait and switch" standby) and the film leads elsewhere, and that's where it falls apart.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is well done and quite intriguing.  Will Smith as Detective Spooner is investigating a strange death of the creator of these robots.  The dead man happened to have fallen out of a window, so everyone thinks its suicide.  Spooner suspects otherwise, because he has a history of hating robots.  Everyone else "knows" that there's no way a robot could commit murder because of the three operating principles.  So, we get an interesting storyline in which the robot is apprehended and interrogated.  The film has the look and feel of another film set in the future (Spielberg's "Minority Report").  In fact, to watch both films as a double feature would convince you that they take place in the same time period and place as one another.  I liked that about this film (because I'm a huge fan of "Minority Report").<br /><br />Once the twist happens, the film goes into a different tangent and it all goes downhill from there.  Its a gimmick that I'm growing tired of...the old switcheroo.  Movie audiences are so sophiscated these days that Hollywood seems like they have to continually pull fast ones on moviegoers by making unexpected twists in the story just to throw people off from predicting the ending.  But by the end of this movie, who really cared?  The trailers sold it as one thing, the film resolves to something else entirely, and I couldn't help but feel ripped off and cheated.  This film wasn't so much a murder mystery, exploring the paradox of the three rules in regards to how a robot could commit murder, as it is a cautionary tale about the militarization of the country as it moves towards totalitarianism by use of artificial intelligence to do the dirty deed of preventing people from rising up against the corporate takeover of our government.  If that's what the film was about, they should have sold it as such, but don't string people along thinking its about a robot accused of murder, making it look guilty, then pulling a switcheroo to where the robot is actually a savior.  Lame.  I expected much better.  See "Minority Report" instead.  Its a more profound film.</p></body></html>

Director Inarritu uses jumbled and juxtaposed scenes to tell the story of three people affected by a terrible tragedy.<br /><br />Naomi Watts is brilliant as Christina, an addicted housewife who loses her husband and two daughters in a hit and run accident.<br /><br />Benicio del Toro gives a fine performance as the driver of the truck, an alcoholic ex-con who is now a born again Christian, trying to reform his life.<br /><br />Melissa Leo is excellent as his desperate wife, trying to get him to put her and his children first.  A supporting actress nod should have been noticed at the Oscars.<br /><br />Sean Penn, who was marvelous in MYSTIC RIVER, is even more so in this film, for which he should have received the Oscar.  Maybe he got it because he was so good in both movies.  He plays the infidel college professor who receives Watts' husband's heart and saves his life.  Penn's obsession with finding out his donor's name leads to an involvement with Watts that is both poignant and tragic.<br /><br />Charlotte Gainsbourg as Penn's wife suffers from a stiff and one tone performance, but fortunately she's not in the movie too much.  A more versatile actress would have added much more.<br /><br />Watts probably would have won the Best Actress Oscar in a different year; Charlie Theron's MONSTER was such a critically acclaimed crowd pleaser Watts got lost in the shuffle.  But it is a tremendous performance.</p></body></html>

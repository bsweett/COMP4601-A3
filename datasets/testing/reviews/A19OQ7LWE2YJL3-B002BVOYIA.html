And a lesser tragedy is that Don Cheadle did not win the Best Actor Oscar!  How could they not award him the oscar for this magnificent performance?!  To give it to Jamie Foxx for doing a two-hour impression is ludicrous.<br /><br />This movie is a monumental account of what happened in Rwanda that the whole western world turned their face away from.</p></body></html>

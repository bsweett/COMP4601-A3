It asks the veiwer to decide whats so different between what happened at the 1972 Israli Olympics and what the Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team did in responce.  In 1972 Palestinian terrorists held Israli athletes hostage, eleven of them, and then murdered them all.  This group of terrorists went by the name of Black September.  After the aftermath a group of Jewish nobodies was formed for the soul purpose of killing the men resposible for planning the murders.  This movie follows their story.  The team leader is Avner (Eric Bana), a married man expecting child and within moments his life is put on hold and put in danger.  As the movie progresses you can see that Avner battles moral issues, trying to decide whether what he's doing is worth all that he could be giving up.  There's a scene where he's talking to his child on the phone and he breaks down because he's missing so much, and for all he knows he could miss everything.  As we learn more about the conflict between these two people, the Jewish and Arab people, we begin to see there may not me much difference between them at all.  Is their revenge that much different then their reason for such?  "Thousands of years of hatred doesn't make you decent."  Besides asking such moral questions, that aside, this film offers a thrilling story, a thrilling, fast past and engaging film that keeps you at the edge of your seat.  Through flashbacks we see what exactly happened on that fateful day at the Olympics.  The morality really plays key here as each and every man on the mission battles feelings of guilt and a lack of morality as they carry out this mission for their country, for their people.  It's a story for all to see, about revenge and the act of and how it affects us as a people but also as individuals.  Acting on all fronts is brilliant, Bana especially.  Spielberg is genius.  Remember...  "All this blood comes back on our heads."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fiction version of the final broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion"></head><body><p>A Prairie Home Companion was a radio program that wasted hosted in the 1970's and 1980's that was broadcasted each Saturday night from the Fitzgerald Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota, the movie pretty much takes place in the theatre that night, with the beginning being filmed at Mickey's Diner, that fans of the Mighty Ducks movies might regonize that little diner, even from D3: The Mighty Ducks. My two biggest problems with the movie is that the oepnning credits are kind of well, how should I put it, boring? My other problem is, that I felt watching this movie, that they spent too much time showing what was going on backstage at the final broadcast, the actors kept talking over the songs. Okay so it might look 3 problems, I have with this movie. But if you are a big fan of the radio program, you will most denfily, or its music, you will certinaly this movie. If I wanted to see what goes on backstage at a progam like this, I would try to look for another movie that this happens, we could have seen more of the show, after all isn't backstage supposed to be private? The program's creator Garrison Keillor appears as himself, and he also hosts the program. The regular performers of this show, come back for the last show, and that the new owner, wants to take down the theatre, and put in a parking lot. And it ios almost show time, now radio shows for a certain station, are put on at the station itself, and every so often a live broadcast could happen form somewhere else. And not Prairie Home Companion, it was broadcasted from a theatre in front of a paying crowd, and people can also tune in on the radio. But GK being stubbron, doesn't want to say a few farewell wods to listeners, and refuses to do so. The regulars inlude sisters Yolanda and Rhonda Johnson (Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin), and they sing about memories of thier old home. Yolanda's daughter, Lola (Lindsey Lohan) is backstage writing poems about suicide. And there are singing cowboys Dusty and Lefty (Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly). And you also get a balladeer Chuck Akers (L.Q. Jones). And don't get me started about Guy Noir (Kevin Kline) who works for security that falls for lovely lady (Virginia Madsen). The movie got handed a PG-13, which is for the humor that goes on in the movie, so this movie won't really be appiorate for your kid, and you wou will kow your kids pretty then I do, but maybe at least wait until they are at the right age for this movie.</p></body></html>

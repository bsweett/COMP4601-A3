<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining off-center movie with surprises"></head><body><p>"In Bruges" surprised me, which is something that movies generally fail to do.  It started off as a funny and entertaining mobster-buddy movie, and after I got comfortable with that, the movie slapped me across the face with a tone shift that took me totally by surprise.  The entire movie is like that - as soon as you think you have some firm ground under your feet, it shifts.  And it works, amazingly.  "In Bruges" wasn't at all what I expected; it was better than I had anticipated.  Although I wasn't in love with the ending, it didn't make me want to throw things at the TV, either.  Definitely worth a rent for those who enjoy British crime movies.</p></body></html>

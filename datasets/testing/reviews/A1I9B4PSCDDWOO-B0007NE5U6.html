Its a very charming and undemanding movie where Bridget tries to take her relationship with Mark Darcy to the next level. The sequel proves to be just as laid back as the first movie and I enjoyed the comic talents of all three stars involves, Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Yes, Grant as back in his usual role from the first movie, trying to "change" but remaining the same wormy self.<br /><br />There are some uneven spots along the way which may distract from the overall story. A good example of this would be the subplot of Bridget's friend and her involvment with a younger man which get Bridget thrown in Thai prison where she bonded with all these Thai women who really had bad relationships; making Bridget realized how lucky she was with Mark. The entire scene, charming as it is, was bit off tangent from the general tone of the movie.<br /><br />Zellweger managed to master her English accent pretty well this time around and her perky demeanor and high spirit carried the movie pretty well. Her skills as an actress also improved as well. Both Firth and Grant provided very good support as well. Firth had more screen time then Grant this time around and Bridget's "friends and family" also got less screen time as movie worked around the relationship between Bridget and Mark. A good all around comedy that I thought to be pretty entertaining and enjoyable to watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best of the series so far!"></head><body><p>Tobey Maguire sizzles on and achieves several things besides an outstanding characterization of Our Hero. We get that rarity, a GOOD sequel, and still rarer, one that surpasses the original. Kirsten Dunst FINALLY gives us a strong heroine who stands by her man instead of weepingly accepting that She Must Only Be Loved From Afar because of danger (unlike the annoy un-coupling of Superman and Lois Lane in the Superman series!). We're given an eerie and haunting look at the next movie in the works at the end, but I don't want to spoil it for you. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? Buy the DVD. It's cheaper than a night at the movies w/overpriced snacks anyway.</p></body></html>

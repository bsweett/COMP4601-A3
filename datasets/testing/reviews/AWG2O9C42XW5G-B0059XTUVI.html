Meryl streep is a good character performer. i saw a video of the real thatcher and i could not tell the diffrence between them, the same way with julia and julia she was julia childs. Meryl streep deserved an oscar for this movie. if she was not in it i think this movie would of been a big flop. this movie is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></body></html>

You get a crisp, gorgeous print of the film; an edition of Robert Osbourne's &quot;Becoming Attractions&quot; that is over 40 minutes long and gives you an overview of Bogart's career by showing about a dozen of his film trailers linked by some interesting commentary; a nice little print essay on the mystery genre; and separate and distinct trailers (that is, they're not part of the Osbourne piece) for both &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;Satan Met a Lady&quot;.  The latter was one of the earlier adaptations of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, with the slight difference being that the producers apparently decided to turn it into a goofy comedy!  Looking at the two trailers, one gets an immediate education about how different producers can take the same book and come up with wildly different takes on it.  Anyway, this DVD is well worth picking up, especially for the price.  One final observation, about the film itself:  &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; is a classic for twenty-three different reasons, but here's one of those smaller reasons that I especially like: one of the major characters, Floyd Thursby, wasn't even cast!  The innovative screenplay makes him a major protagonist without even showing him; we get a complete sense of him from the way the other characters describe him and his actions.  In other words, Thursby is right there with the rest of the classic characters- provoking responses, impacting on the action- even though we don't actually see him. Neat, huh?</p></body></html>

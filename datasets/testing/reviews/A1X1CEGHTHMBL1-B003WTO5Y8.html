<meta name="summary" content="The FBI and a serial killer cannibal working together to catch another serial killer; what more could scare you to death!"></head><body><p>Clarice Starling (Jody Foster) is a star pupil at the FBI training academy when her mentor, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) pulls her out of training to help assist on a case. Jack is the head of the Behavioral Science Unit of the FBI and he wants Clarice to interview Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) regarding a case about a serial killer. Hannibal is known as Hannibal the Cannibal for his horrific murders in which he practiced cannibalism on his victims.<br /><br />Jack thinks that Hannibal, who is a psychiatrist, could help in solving a case involving a new serial killer called Buffalo Bill by using his insight into serial killers and psychiatry. Buffalo Bill kills women and skins parts of their bodies. Hannibal is angry that Jack sent a newbie young woman agent to try to entice him to talk. He won't help but when Clarice is leaving and is soiled by one of the other prisoners he agrees to help her. Hannibal's clues lead her to evidence of an old murder and to a possible link between Hannibal and Buffalo Bill. Hannibal's leads help the investigation but also turn into severe complications....<br /><br />This movie is about the evil that men can do and of a young agent becoming exposed to the world of the criminally insane. Many scenes are macabre and horrifying so if you don't like those types of movies then you should consider if this movie is for you. It is truly a crime and horror classic movie and the acting is superb. The story line is very tightly done and directed expertly and the movie was a box office hit as well as the winner of multiple academy awards.<br /><br />It is a very good movie and I recommend it to you, just remember it is deep and ghastly film!</p></body></html>

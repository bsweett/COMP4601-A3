<meta name="summary" content="Ah, Teenage agst.  Where would we be without it."></head><body><p>3 1/2<p>It's very typical for these kind of film's to be more liked by the &quot;underground&quot; anti-everything crowd then main stream audiences. It appeals more to the teenager who feels the same way  Enid does. (Love her name btw) Thora Birch truly brings out the &quot;Daria&quot; like depressing charm in this not-so-unique but well done role. BTW-She looked absolutely cute through out this whole film, I totally fell for her with that short black hair, bold glasses, and perky outfits. She is such a doll! Too bad it seems like she lost all that weight now. ANYWAY <p>The movie has some great comedic moments following our pal Enid through her pessimistic look at life. Like when she get's a job at the theatre and the art class scenes to name two. While at first it seems creepy  that she likes this old dude Steve Buscemi they each have a charm that makes them perfect for eachother. Steve plays the dud like no one else can, but he always has a dignity about him. The movie is colorfuly and is really nice to watch it has a 50's charm in the decor and feel of the sets. The supporting cast is a riot and makes for an all round good 2hrs of film.<p>The film is not flawed though, while I'm all for endings that one can discuss with others. I feel that the Enid character didn't have any sort of redemption at the end. She talked about dissapointing everyone, and yet does nothing to fix this. I felt so bad for Steve at the end that I just couldn't appreciate what happens at the end. I know it's  supposed to symbolize that their ARE NO certainties in life, and there will always be things that suprise you. Enid realized this and went for it, BUT she should have fixed things with Steve before she left, I cannot forgive her for this.<p>Well if you like these Village-type movies or anti-everything  Art house films check out Waking Life, Fight Club, Mulholland Dr., or Vanilla Sky</p></body></html>

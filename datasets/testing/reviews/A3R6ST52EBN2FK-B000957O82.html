<meta name="summary" content="likable and good feeling film"></head><body><p>I challenge anyone who sees this film not to feel better after seeing it.  I don't understand why the critics panned it so hard.  Will Smith was perfect and of course Kevin James.  Also Eva Mendes, god that woman can work a skirt!  Anyways this movie is great fun, go see it!!</p></body></html>

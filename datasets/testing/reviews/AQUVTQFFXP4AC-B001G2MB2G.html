<meta name="summary" content="5 Stars for Movie, 2 Stars for "Special Edition" DVD"></head><body><p>The movie was great, not perfect, but great.  You can read all about it elsewhere.<br /><br />This, meanwhile, is my honest, appalled, and feeling somewhat ripped-off review of the Two Disc "Special" Edition DVD.<br /><br />Where's the specialness?!  Where's the features?!  Why am I paying up to 75% more for an extra disc over the normal version!?<br /><br />For the sake of continuity with my other HP movies that come with two discs, and not wanting to be left out on the bonus features, I got the Special Edition.<br /><br />The bonus features are laughably minimal, and barely exceeding an hour in full.<br /><br />Magic of Editing: A very short documentary about the importance of editing in a scene, then a stupid game that lets you add music and sound effects to a scene from the movie.<br /><br />Deleted and Alternate Scenes: The totality of these scenes, minus the first one which seemed just a joke for the die-hard fans, added up to maybe five minutes or less.  Would it really have hurt the movie to include them in the final cut?  Most of the scenes were second-long add-ons to other scenes, such as Neville claiming The Daily Prophet really is full of crap after Seamus confronts Harry in the common room, or Harry passing by Dumbledore's office towards the end, and Dumbledore motioning for him to come in.  That's really it.  The first deleted scene was basically just focusing on the Divinations Professor (sorry, forgot her name) during Umbridge's speech to the students in the Great Hall, basically spilling her food, dropping cream in her water, and all in all making an idiot of herself during the entire 3-4 minute speech.  Clearly they had no intention of including this in the movie, simply because of the sheer ridiculousness and complete irrelevance of it.<br /><br />The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter:  Basically just describing Harry's journey through the first five movies, and "speculating" on what's to come, as if the books didn't exist.  The introduction tells us that there are clues all over the movies as to Harry's eventual fate with Voldemort, but the documentary didn't bother dealing too much with this.<br /><br />Trailing Tonks:  Possibly the only really fun part of this bonus.  Natalie Tena (who seems perpetually hopped up on caffeine in this documentary) dressed as Nymphadora Tonks (and occasionally appearing on screen as herself, sans makeup, talking about her experience during this scene or that) guides us around some of the set to show us how various things were done, from sound editing, catering, shooting, prop building, set building, and choreography for wand duels.  She also sings a song on a guitar, with a fabulous voice.  Whole thing lasted like 10 minutes.<br /><br />So basically, this "special" edition gives you a few random clips and bits of the movie that add nothing more to the story already missing large pieces according to the book readers, a documentary having little to do with the movie itself, Nat Tena giving us 10 minutes of a fun tour, and a stupid little game not even worth playing.  And they need a whole nother DVD to fit this 1 hour or less of content and package it as if it were the definitive version to own.  Clearly not worth it.</p></body></html>

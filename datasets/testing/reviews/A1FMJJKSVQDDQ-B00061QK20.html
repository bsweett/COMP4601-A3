While it does have some fantastic fight scenes (the choreography is definitely majestic; equal to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "House of Flying Daggers"), it does have some beautiful scenery. You get to see deserts, forests, lakes, hills, and the palace of Qin all in just a hundred minutes. And the use of one color in particular sequences is what really makes this film more than it is, though I'm not sure what the colors really signify (I'm no film expert). Oh, and don't bother with the seemingly "unrealistic" things that go on in the film, like flying in the air and dodging arrows with nothing but your clothes, because it's art. It's not logic, but it's pure art. The only thing I didn't like about "Hero" was Zhang Ziyi. She is a great actress, but I found her doing a bit of overacting a few times. But with that said, everyone gives excellent performances. Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen, Chen Daoming, and Ziyi turn out to be a great team of actors. Let's hope we see more from these men and women again.<br /><br />So go see this film. You'll be mesmerized.</p></body></html>

Then, as it proceeds through the Dunkirk sequence and into, what after awhile, is revealed as fantasy, the movie takes on a new dimension and it captured my attention. The real kicker comes near the end when Venessa Redgrave makes her appearance and admissions. Beautiful photography dominates the first half during the 1936 period. The war sequence, though technically impressive with its 5-minute tracking shot, doesn't have the same impact. Worth watching.</p></body></html>

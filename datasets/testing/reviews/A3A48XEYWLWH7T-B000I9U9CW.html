<meta name="summary" content="Nifty little thriller"></head><body><p>Sunday, August 01, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Nifty little thriller.<br /><br />Taut, quickly paced and right to the point, this nifty little thriller has Colin Farrell being held `hostage' in a New York city phone booth by Kiefer Sutherland, who has his rifle sights trained on him from above.  Urged by Kiefer, slick publicist Farrell must obey and confess his sins or see those innocents around him shot.  Police are dispatched and the interplay between sniper, hostage, and police make for a decent thriller.  It doesn't try to be more than it is, and it's over as quickly as it starts but for that hour-15 or so it's pretty effective albeit somewhat preposterous.</p></body></html>

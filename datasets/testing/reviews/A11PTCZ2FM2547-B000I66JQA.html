<meta name="summary" content="Do Not Mix With A Sedative"></head><body><p>If indeed there is a stream of super-consciousness that literally and figuratively transcends space and time, then such a force is manifested in THE HOURS, a powerful, gripping examination of three lives over the course of one eventful day.<p>The story is rooted in the novel, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; and its author, Virgina Woolf (Nicole Kidman).  Woolf, in part due to her own depression and self-deprecation, abandoned realist literature with her novel and concentrated instead on the thoughts of her characters.  In the pages of her book human fragility is exposed, and this fragility permeates two other women in two different times:  a lonely, restless housewife in 1950's Los Angeles (Julianne Moore); and a present-day career woman (Meryl Streep) who is busily planning a party for a dying friend.  This film moves superbly from one place in time--from one character's growing angst and sense of misgiving--to another, until at last the three separate stories are tied together in astonishing and remarkable fashion.<p>Kidman, Moore, and Streep are incomparable; the supporting cast (including Ed Harris in a brief, yet haunting role) is stellar.  No, THE HOURS is not a film that will cheer you up, yet its somber, moody, even dark examination of the inner recesses of the human mind will stir your soul and inspire wonder.<br />--D.

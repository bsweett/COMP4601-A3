<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer Connelly is on in Dark Water, give it a chance."></head><body><p>DARK WATER is the American remake of the Japanese<br />movie of the same name. I also agree with another reviewer,<br />this is a thriller not a horror movie. Do not let<br />that deter, this is a pretty intelligent thriller bundled<br />as a drama. Speaking of that then there is no<br />better dramatic actress right now than Jennifer<br />Connelly. Even snobbish critics of this movie can't slam<br />her performance in this, she is very , very good.<br /><br />Connelly is become a master of this sort of thing, letting<br />her emotions speak for itself and guide the movie into<br />a dark atmosphere, something she's done quite well in<br />her work (A Beautiful Mind).<br /><br />I liked the movie overall, and I have not seen the Japanese<br />movie, but that's a good thing since people won't<br />be so conceited in comparing both. That said it was much<br />better than "The Grudge" with Sarah Michelle Gellar. That<br />movie was horribly directed, edited and acted.<br /><br />This movie was not, it's got a decent cast including<br />John C. Reilly.</p></body></html>

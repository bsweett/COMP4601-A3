<meta name="summary" content="Good Christmas Flick."></head><body><p>"Elf" is a cute Christmas movie with a great (and funny) script, great character acting, and a great Christmas soundtrack. Elf was a surprise hit a couple years ago and is (If I remember correctly) Will Ferrell's highest grossing film. The movie stars Ferrell, James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, Bob Newhart, and Faizon Love. The movie begins when Santa (Asner, who is perfect for the role) is making his rounds at an orphanage and a young baby crawls in his bag. Santa doesn't discover the baby until he returns to the North Pole and one of the elves, Papa Elf (Newhart) volunteers to raise the baby who is named Buddy. Well, Buddy grows up and at the age of thirty finally realizes that he is not in fact an elf.<br /><br />Buddy then learns that his father is on the naughty list (god forbid) and begins his journey to New York city. When Buddy meets his skeptical father Walter (Caan) a workaholic children's book publisher, he is thrown out of the building but doesn't let it get him down. Buddy migrates to Gimbels where he meets the store manager played by Faizon Love. This is easily the most underrated character in the film, Love delivers several jokes which had me bawling. Love is very good with physical humor as well as verbal...But anyway, it is at Gimbels that Buddy meets Jovie (Zooey Deschanel, who I've seen in several other films but looks absolutely gorgeous in this movie). I'm glad the Jovie character existed in the movie, because Deschanel is great (and very hot) but Buddy and Jovie don't make an extraordinary couple. Anyway, after Walter discovers that Buddy really is his son Buddy moves in with Walter and his wife Emily (Steenburgen) and son Michael and then well...See the movie. I have to add that in the movie Deschanel sings the song "Baby, It's Cold Outside" and I need to add that she's got a great voice. She's an amazing singer, she was so good in fact that I bought the soundtrack. But, yeah this is a great Christmas comedy and is destined to be a Christmas favorite. A-</p></body></html>

Joaquin Phoenix, whose deep, sad eyes have added emotional depth even to comedies like "Parenthood" and "To Die For", plays Johnny Cash as a passionate, intuitive artist, a hopeless romantic and a wounded, sometimes self-destructive soul. To his first wife, he's an irresponsible dreamer who's off chasing rainbows leaving her stuck with the everyday responsibilities of raising their children. So it's no wonder he finds himself smitten by June Carter, who radiates down-to-earth charm and maternal kindness. Now that I've finally seen this film, I can totally understand why Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for her performance. She plays June Carter as a complicated woman; sweet and tough, humble and charismatic, passionate and moral. After seeing "Brokeback Mountain" I asked myself why it was that the most believable love stories are always the sad ones. "Walk the Line" offers a convincing love story with a happy ending. Who knew such a thing was possible?</p></body></html>

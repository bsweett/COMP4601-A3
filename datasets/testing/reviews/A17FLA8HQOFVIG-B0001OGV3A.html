<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece of myth and fantasy"></head><body><p>Shot entirely in mainland China, and using the most modern technical effects, this video has the best martial arts action scenes I have ever seen.  Subtitled in Chinese, the story is simple to follow.  Yun-Fat Chow of &quot;Anna and the King&quot; is cast as the hero who is searching for the killer of his master.  But the film belongs entirely to the women.  Michelle Yeoh is cast as the woman warrior who has not married him because of family complications; not only is she an accomplished martial artist, but this role calls for some serious acting. There's an older woman Pei-pei Cheng, another fantastic martial artist who plays the villain.  But the most memorable performance of all is by the young Ziyi Zhang in the role of the young teenager who steals a sacred sword and flees from her arranged marriage.<p>The fight scenes are absolutely spectacular!  Choreographed with exquisite artistry, they mostly feature the women.  You have to suspend a bit of belief in the real world though, because these sword fighters have the ability to walk up walls,  leap a dozen stories high, and even fly.  But it's all done so well, that I just sat and watched in amazement, the story merely a backdrop to this action.  Feminists will applaud this film;  it demonstrates women's physical strength and endurance like no other.  Yes, it is violent, but the fact that it is fantasy dilutes that effect.  And themes of love, honor and vengeance drive the story forward.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

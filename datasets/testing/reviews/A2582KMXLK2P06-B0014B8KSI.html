Right from the beginning the movie demands a LOT of your attention, or you will end up very confused in a matter of 5 minutes.  The suspense or mystery wasn't really intriguing to me, and the only part that really interested me was when George's character pulled over to some field, seen some unusually quiet horses, then his car blew up behind him, shocking him badly (and shocking the viewers too- didn't see THAT coming!)<br /><br />After that scene, you really need to pay close attention to everything else to understand what's going on.</p></body></html>

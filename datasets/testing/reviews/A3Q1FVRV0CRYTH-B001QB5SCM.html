I expected a comedy, somthing trivial and just ordinary to pass the time...but what I got was a delightful dramedy that touched my heart and made me laugh, cry and smile almost as much as this years 'The Family Stone'.  This story, adapted from Jennifer Weiner's novel of the same name, revolves around two sisters.  Rose (Toni Collette) is the smart succesful lawyer with low self esteem due to a little extra weight and not so much of a love life (in the first few scenes we see her take a picture of a man in her bed because she wants proof she actually slept with someone).  Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is the funny, ditzy, trampy one who deep down has low self esteem because of her illiteracy.  These two sisters love to hate each other and after one too many fights they part their ways.  What happens next is a great look at family and life and life without family.  Maggie, upon discovering they have a grandmother they never knew, or at least thought was dead, decides to take a bus to Florida to stay with her.  Her grandmother Ella (Shirley McLaine) lives in a "retirement home for active seniors," and offers to help Maggie get back on her feet.  With Maggie out of the picture Rose starts to grow, socially and actually gets a boyfriend, a serious boyfriend who in turn proposes.  At the same time, Maggie goes from trampy mooch to respectable, responcible and reliable.  It almost seems as if these girls are better off apart, but as they soon realize without each other they don't make sense.  As the girls finally come to terms with each other and, with the help of their 'newfound' grandmother, come to terms with the early death of their mother, we see them grow and mature, each in their own ways.  What's so great about this film is that is aproaches each charactor with care and compassion helping you too sympatize with each one.  You feel for Rose when blows up at Maggie because you understand how crazy Maggie must make her, but you also feel for Maggie when she fails a job interview because of her illiteracy.  In the beggining you'll want to cry, by the middle you'll start to laugh, and in the end you break a smile.  This is a great, underrated and swept under the radar type film that should be enjoyed by everyone with a heart.  Performances were great across the board, most notibly by Cameron Diaz who stole my heart with every frame.  This is truly one of those films that both women and their husbands (I'm one of those husbands) can really enjoy.</p></body></html>

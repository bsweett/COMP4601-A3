Quite simply Superman Returns is just about perfect.  It has nearly everything one could want in a 21st Century incarnation for the Man of Steel and the physical production is visually as eye-poppingly glorious as anyone could hope for.  The flying scenes (especially the Superman in space scenes) have a breadth and beauty around them that almost stops one's breath - absolutely stunning.<br /><br />As we've come to expect, there is great humor throughout with winks to the comic books and previous Superman flicks and director Singer doesn't shrink from paying obvious homage to the Reeve flicks - a very nice touch, indeed.  Singer doesn't shrink, either, from going for broke in the second half of the film's more emotional content and the balance between action, love story, and pseudo-religious, philosophical storyline is just about perfect.<br /><br />For all the pre-opening hype criticisms centering around an unknown actor portraying comic's most beloved hero, Brandon Routh proves the naysayers pretty much wrong.  He's got the look, the moves and the feel of the character down.  If his Clark Kent doesn't quite have the presence Reeve brought to the role - (this Clark isn't quite as endearingly bumbling or nerdy) he makes Clark likeable and believable - and makes fully plausible why Lois finds him slightly forgettable.  As The Man of Steel, however, Routh takes the challenge straight on and does not once disappoint his audience.<br /><br />The opening sequences setting up the story have a classic old movie feel, a bit of exposition for history, hilarious snips of Lex Luthor beginning his bid for world domination, Lois and the rest of the world moving on in the years since Superman (and Clark's) leave of absence, all culminating in a breathtaking action sequence wherein our hero saves the lives of those aboard the space shuttle - and ties it all in with America's favorite pastime - Baseball!<br /><br />Kate Bosworth's Lois is a bit bristley (Lois always was) but she always let's the vulnerable quality of her character crack through the tough-as-nails exterior.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey's Lex starts off with a bang, but it isn't until the sequence with Lois aboard his yacht - the turning point of the film - that he gets to fully charm us with his evil craziness.  If up til then I thought Spacey hadn't quite captured the role (as I envisioned anyway), from this point on he OWNED Lex.<br /><br />Parker Posey is an entirely different creature than was Valerie Perrine.  Where Perrine was all curves and opinions, Posey is all angles and dim.  A different spin on the character, but a worthy one.<br /><br />It was terrific to see Eva Marie Saint - now in her 60th year of films, in the small role of Martha Kent.  Even washing dishes or driving her truck, Saint exudes movie star quality that proves the old adage "there are no small roles."<br /><br />The movie's more than two and a half hours fly by and everyone - at least at the screening I attended - is left feeling like a kid again.<br /><br />This is probably going to be the hit of the summer and well it should.  It has just about everything one could want in a first "return" feature for this superhero and I'm already excited for 2009's sequel!  See it on a big screen.  Now!</p></body></html>

I have never seen anything that captures the cruel magnificence of the Antarctic landscape like this film. The bravery of these creatures and their faithfulness to the ritual of reproduction puts all small human problems in perspective. To walk 70 miles on solid ice, to starve yourself and risk death to produce one fragile egg . . . unbelievable. Life and death -- the beauty of the life cycle -- no room for mistakes, which mean certain death. When you finish this film you feel as if you have touched briefly the divine. Everyone should see this film.</p></body></html>

It simply stunk, and I wasted a buck to rent it (not to mention an hour before I fell asleep).  My wife now refuses to let me rent anything.  (My last selection was Son of Rambow, so you see why).  What the hell - not funny, no plot, and who wants to watch an ugly guy walk around in boxers and an ugly bathroom.  Whoever gave this more than 1 star (I wish I could have given it 0) is an idiot!  The Coen Brothers have done some good work - Fargo and Old Men, but this one was a dud.</p></body></html>

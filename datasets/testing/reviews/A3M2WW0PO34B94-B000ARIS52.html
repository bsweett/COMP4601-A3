A cop with a bad heart (Bruce Willis) attempts to save an eleven year old girl, Nancy, from the sadistic killer, Junior (Nick Stahl). Marv (Mickey Rourke), a gangster, trawls the streets looking for the person who killed the hooker he slept with last night. Another gangster (Clive Owen) leads the abusive ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro) of his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) into Old Town, an area run by hookers.<br /><br />Each of these stories pays homage to Film Noir, a type of filmmaking prevalent in the late 40s and early 50s. Every so often a filmmaker will take a stab at recreating the genre, with mixed results. Rodriguez appears to have been inspired by the source material, because this is not only one of his best films, but also one of the best modern takes on Noir. "City" has all of the trademarks of classic Noir; black and white cinematography, heroes and heroines trying to live in a corrupt society, villains trying to maintain control and desperate, desperate people.<br /><br />Like much of the "Spy Kids" films, Rodriguez shot most of "City" in front of a blue screen. Basically, he filmed the actors in front of a blank wall and added the backgrounds and special effects later. Many films use this technique for part of the process, but "City" appears to have been made using primarily this process. Almost all of the film is shot in black and white. This might be problematic for some, but I completely forgot about the lack of color, until he used brief glimpses of color. The backgrounds are richly detailed in shades of black, white and gray. They also appear to be consistent, helping to create a believable world. Because I believed in the setting of the film, I didn't miss the color. Color is used as a punctuation point. In some scenes, the red of blood appears, in others, the gold of a woman's hair. This creates a unique, interesting visual style, which appears to be inspired by the source material. Rodriguez also moves the camera to replicate graphic novel angels, making us believe that we are in a living comic book. Normally, all of these `tricks' would serve to draw the viewer out of the story and universe. In "City", it all serves to draw us in.<br /><br />The unique visual style is only the first element necessary to make us believe. The second, and perhaps most crucial element, are the actors. Frequently, in a movie based on comic books or similar material, all of the work is put into the visual. The actors walk through the story, spouting their lines. In "City", every one of the actors, and there are many, portray their characters in a serious way, as though they were in a run of the mill crime drama. No one lets on to the fact that they are basically in a live action graphic novel. Because they believe, this helps us believe, adding further to the creation of "Sin City" as a `real place'. It is difficult to say there is a lead in the film, but Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba all take on meatier roles in the interconnecting stories. They are joined by Elijah Wood, Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Michael Clarke Duncan, Josh Hartnett, Michael Madsen and a collection of young starlets. In any film with different stories, and this many actors, each person needs to make an impact and make one fast or they get lost in the shuffle. A lot of this has to do with how central the character is to the story; if they have a lot to do, they will be on screen more. Also, in Noir, the stories are usually accompanied by voice over narration from the lead character. In each of the stories, the main characters provide voice over, giving us insight into their thoughts. Hartigan, played by Willis, is steely, determined and effective. Marv, played by Rourke, whose plastic surgery is covered with enough make-up to make him resemble a Dick Tracy character, embarks on a memorable journey. Owen and Del Toro are also effective as they battle each other in Old Town, with the help of a number of very deadly hookers. All of these actors do a great job of helping to make "Sin City" all the more engaging.<br /><br />The interconnecting stories will probably bring "Pulp Fiction" to mind for many. When a major star appears in the first five minutes of the film, you get the feeling that their character will return at another point, probably the finale. The interconnecting stories share timelines and characters, creating a larger more interesting portrait. I find it interesting to watch a filmmaker's career and trace the `ancestry' of their films. In "Sin City", Rodriguez uses the digital technology that he used effectively in the "Spy Kids" trilogy, but takes it to another degree. He combines this with the sort of violent story that he has told well in previous films like "From Dusk Till Dawn" and "Once Upon A Time In Mexico".<br /><br />"City" is hard-boiled Noir. As I mentioned, color is used sporadically throughout. There is a lot of violence and, thankfully, Rodriguez only occasionally shows the blood in color. More often it appears as a milky white. He uses red as a punctuation point, drawing our attention to the actors or action; occasionally, red appears in a pool of blood, or in a person's shoes, or in a hooker's dress. This doesn't diminish the effect of the violence, it enhances it. Nudity also has a place in Sin City and it is the most gratuitous element of the film. Somehow, this is also fitting. You would expect nudity to be fairly common place in a town known for its sin.<br /><br />"Sin City" is one of the most visually interesting and challenging films I have seen in a long time. It has a dazzling visual style all its own, combined with a hard-boiled story and some very good performances, "Sin City" will be remembered for years to come.</p></body></html>

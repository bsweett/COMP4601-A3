<meta name="summary" content="And all that jazz has never sounded so good! 8-D"></head><body><p>There aren't enough words that I can come up with to say how amazing that "Chicago" really is. This movie, actually a musical, is a stunning array of music, amazing dancing acts, great storylines, and a whole sense of fun woven into the dark and dramatic theme of this movie. There haven't been many musicals in recent years due to the lack of popularity during recent times and naturally, I'm not a big fan of musicals but I think that Chicago brings new life into this genre of movies and has paved the way to bringing musicals back into the front spotlight again for the new generations of movie-goers. DANGER: Possible spoilers ahead, hopefully not. <p>Set in the Jazz Age of the early 1920s, Al Capone was rising to become the notorious Prohibition Era gangster leader, and new fashion trends were causing an uproar. Outside the shadow of Capone's looming shadow, this movie is a tale of two well known dancers who are suspected of killing their husbands after an affair. Roxie Art, who faces possible execution for murdering her abusive boyfriend who constantly rejected her and her estranged husband Amos refused to take blame for it, seeks a money hungry, never-lost-a-case lawyer named William Flynn played by Richard Gere to win her freedom and also her road to stardom and to flee from her estranged husband Amos. <p>The songs that accompany the individual events are so much fun to listen to, combined with the dancing performances by the individual characters. Personally, I love the Big Band and ragtime music that accompanies the movie scenes and the performers and stage performances are amazing. All of the characters in "Chicago" are amazing but for me, it's a toss up between Queen Latifah as Matron "Mama" Morton, Catherine Zeta Jones as Velma Kelley, and Richard Gere as William Flynn. Except for Flynn who is their lawyer, they are all charged with the murders of their `loved' ones who have been unfaithful to them and their desire for revenge drove them to madness. All of the songs that accompany each of the scenarios are innovative and absolute brilliance. The entire cast surpassed all of my expectations in this musical and gave them a whole new image of skill, intelligence, and depth to their characters. I love also seeing the movie flip between the dramatic scenes of Roxie in prison and then the stage performances. <p>Queen Latifah steals part of the spotlight as the elegant Matron "Mama" Morton. Morton offers Roxie Art a deal to get $3K to a lawyer by the name of William `Billy' Flynn who has `never lost a trial' to testify in her favor. Her ruthless `drill sergeant' attitude is classic and sometimes even funny although its humor factor is basically from the big band music that plays along during the scenes. Latifah's vocals are astounding. There's a funny yet good message in her song too. The other half of the spotlight is stolen by Catherine Zeta Jones. Velma Kelley play by Jones is also jailed for murdering two people, though it took place before "Chicago" started. Her manipulative personality brings a large amount of conflict to the musical, not to mention a sense of mystery. I've heard a lot about that Catherine was a dancer for many years and Between Jones and Zellweger, it's obvious for many years and had all the skills needed whereas Zellweger definitely showed a bit of newbie performances but still both are great. Velma is an incredible character too and Zeta Jones is a wonderful singer in this film. As Roxie gains the fame that she has longed for though, Velma is forgotten by many and a bitter rivalry ensues between them. Yes, Roxie is a great dancer but isn't anywhere close to Velma's dancing skills in my opinion. Richard Gere though is another standout as the semi-sleazy lawyer Flynn who seems to get the women characters nuts over him. I must honestly say, I never thought that Richard Gere could sing but man, he can SING. I would even say that Richard Gere can sing even better than a lot of commercial pop singers in the radio I must add. ;) My favorite scene was William Flynn performing the puppet scene and also Amos singing his song about him being rejected by his wife and being overlooked by the general public called "Mr. Cellophane".  <p>This movie was nominated for a whopping13 Academy Awards for every category except for Best Actor, and won 3 Golden Globes. "Chicago" got its justice with the numerous nominations as it's one of the best musicals to ever come to the big screen in modern times, considering how `out-of-fashion' it seemed immediately before "Moulin Rouge" came along last year and brought musicals back to life for a new generation of musical fans for the new generation and for the generations of the 21st century. Maybe "Chicago" might have been somewhat overhyped but, it's rare that I say this but, it lived up to the hype that surrounded it and is destined to become a classic in the near future.  For some extra trivia, I myself am native to Chicago and I guess for this reason this movie means so much more to me than it would've otherwise had I not been a Native Chicagoan. Go and see this movie before it's too late as it won't have anywhere near the punch on the small screen like it did the on the movie theatre.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Ocean's Thirteen" is excellent!"></head><body><p>"Ocean's Thirteen" is excellent! The star-studded cast led by George Clooney (as Danny Ocean) is excellent. The directing and cinematography by Steven Soderbergh (who also did the directing and cinematography to the first two Ocean's films) is excellent. The story and screenplay by Brian Koppelman & David Levien (who also did the story and screenplay to "Rounders" (1998) is excellent. The music by David Holmes (who also did the music to the first two Ocean's films) is excellent. The film editing by Stephen Mirrione (who also did the film editing to the first two Ocean's films) is excellent. The casting by Debra Zane (who also did the casting to the first two Ocean's films) is excellent. The production design by Philip Messina (who also did the production design to the first two Ocean's films) is excellent. The art direction by Tony Fanning (who also did the art direction to "Ocean's Twelve" (2004) & Doug J. Meerdink (who also did the art direction to "The Good German" (2006) is excellent. The set decoration by Kristen Toscano Messina (who also did the set decoration to the first two Ocean's films) is excellent. The costume design by Louise Frogley (who also did the costume design to "The Good German" (2006) is excellent. This is an interesting caper film that surpasses "Ocean's Twelve" and comes close to surpassing "Ocean's Eleven" (2001).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Incredible!"></head><body><p>This is one of those incredible movies that I want to watch again and again. It is not a happy ending, and I found myself lamenting over lost chances for peace, but this story line makes an impact on the viewer that won't be forgotten. When the peaceful King Baldwin dies at a young age, it's hoped that the blacksmith son of Knight Godfrey will take the king's place. Though things would've been far better, Balian struggles too much with his dark past to do what must be done to marry the princess, take the crown, and save the kingdom from bloodshed. Great movie!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

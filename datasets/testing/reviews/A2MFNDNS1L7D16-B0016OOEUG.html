<meta name="summary" content="Hard-boiled on the outside with a soft center."></head><body><p>That's street smart Lt. Mark McPherson played superbly by Dana Andrews. He's the detective investigatng the murder of a young woman believed to be Laura Hunt, shot in the face with both barrels of a shotgun. That's an important fact to remember even though the body is never shown. We have the start of the much acclaimed, & rightly so, noir murder mystery, Laura. We have a rogues' gallery of prominent suspects. They are a rather disagreeable lot. Casting could not have been better. Clifton Webb is the insufferable radio columnist, Waldo Lydecker. He is the narraror of much of the movie & the cultural mentor to the younger Laura, (Couldn't you just slap him?). He is love with Laura almost as much as he's in love with himself. He is violently against her marriage to: Shelby Carpentor, played<br />by Vincent Price the once wealthly but now broke fiance' of Laura. He's a playboy, cheats on Laura & has never worked a day in his life. Then there is Judith Anderson as the rich widow, Ann Treadwell. She is desperately in love with Shelby & will do anything to have him. Finally, a mysterious young model that works for Laura & is Shelby's lover. That leaves poor Lt. McPherson to fall in love with the hauntingly, beautiful portrait of Laura, (Gene Tierney) above the mantle. Lt. McPherson likes to drink. So he does, at Laura's home using Laura's booze while on the job questioning the suspects. He dines with the suspects & they pick up the tab. Things have changed in the police dept. This novel transfered very well to the screen in the hands of director Otto Preminger. It is early in his career but it is some of his best work. You may figure out who did it before the climax. I won't tell here but the process & the acting excellence is what's important. On your dvd there may be a scene deleted from the theatrical release. It is the story of Laura's rise to prominence with the help of Waldo. This movie was played to many servicemen overseas & it was felt that scene might have been offensive. You decide, I didn't think so. There were some questions raised that in this war time movie there was not a hint of a war going on. Maybe why an able bodied guy like Lt. Mike & dilettantes like Shelby & Waldo weren't drafted.</p></body></html>

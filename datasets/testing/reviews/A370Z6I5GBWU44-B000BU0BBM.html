The idea was rather creative, and kept me engaged, especially as I learned more and more about it, and the actors did a really nice job in their roles. Overall a fun movie, and if you like fairy tales, you will enjoy this retelling, especially as it combines various elements of different familiar fairytales.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Make A Stop At The Bates Motel"></head><body><p>Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is best known for its unforgettable score and infamous shower scene which at the time of its release the most graphic murder scene ever filmed.  But Psycho is so much than just a slasher film.  It is an intensely compelling psychological thriller that draws you in with its riveting plot and first rate acting.  Anthony Perkins is requisitely creepy as motel owner Norman Bates, but he adds so much more to the character.  What could have been just a one-dimensional role, Mr. Perkins approaches it with depth and makes you wonder how Norman became the man he was. Janet Leigh is striking as Marion Crane who decides to steal $40,000.00 and ends up meeting her doom at the Bates Motel.  Vera Miles, John Gavin and the great Martin Balsam all provide tremendous support.  Psycho set the standard by which all subsequent horror films are to be judged.</p></body></html>

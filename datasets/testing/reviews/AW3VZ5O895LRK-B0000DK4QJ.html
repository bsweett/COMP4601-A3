<meta name="summary" content="I Am Finally A Fan"></head><body><p>I was not a fan of Steven Spielberg's movies prior to "Artificial Intelligence."  I liked his films ok prior to that one but the schmaltz factor in them was too much for me.  However, with both "Artificial Intelligence" and  "Minority Report," he brings intelligence to his films plus a visionary look at our futures that I find spellbinding.  So I am now a fan. There is "Precrime" law enforcement in this 2054 Philip K. Dick envisioned world.  It is reliant on 3 human "precogs" in an isolation tank.  They are able to envision murders before they're committed. Precrime officers arrest perpetrators right before they murder and the supposed offenders are confined in isolated tanks for the rest of their lives.  But are the precogs infallible or is there free will right up to the final moment of crime commission?  Tom Cruise, as the top policeman of Precrime, is about to find out. Someone wants him out of that job and having the precogs "see" him kill someone in the future is a darn good way of achieving that.  With that, the movie is off and I was enthralled every step of the way.  The effects are incredible and I am not someone usually taken with special effects.  Cruise is magnificent as is Samantha Morton as the chief precog, Agatha. Speilberg picks the perfect supporting cast to put behind them too every step of the way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This movie turned out to be a parody on itself..."></head><body><p>...and it is probably the worst horror-thriller I've seen so far! Is it because my expectations were high after seing the first, and I had heard so much positive about it? No, this reaction is not my big disappointment talking -this is the reaction of have been wasting my time and money on yet another "Why did they even bother?"-movies. And I am not overdoing it now, this is serious -but I honestly wonder; Were they? Was it ment for this movie to turn into a comedy? If so, it wasn't funny at all! I mean; I don't even know what to call Final Destination 2.<br /><br />It starts out interesting actually. The great traffic accident was the best part of the entire movie (the way it was filmed and arranged that is of course). It's ok the first 30 minutes or so, but then things begin to be boring. Let's just say; the movie is not scary, not creepy, not well acted, not visually appealing, not interesting, not much of anything actually but 90 minutes long. Though I'm not the biggest fan of the Scream-series, well, those movies are so much better. What else can I compare it to, hm... Wrong Turn! Different story, same quality -other than that Wrong Turn has a much higher entertainment-factor. Trust me; if you're after the kick Sixth Sence, The Others or even Gothika (ever so butchered, but...) don't waste your time and money on this movie. It does not require much critical sence to see the waste of this trash. Awful!</p></body></html>

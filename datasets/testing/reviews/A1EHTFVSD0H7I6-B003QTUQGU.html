<meta name="summary" content="Whimsy, Weirdness, Way Less Depp Than Expected"></head><body><p>I didn't feel a compulsion to see this film. I like Johnny Depp but don't have the need to see whatever role he's taken on.<br /><br />But a friend wanted to go and I tagged along.<br /><br />Here are a few things that surprised me.<br /><br />I liked it. Didn't love it but liked it enough that I can suggest that those who love good vs. evil, mythical war scenes and mild to moderate adventure to give it a shot.<br /><br />Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter is a skillfully played and entertaining if sadly whimsical character but he is not the main player. The point of view is primarily Alice. The Hatter doesn't appear until about a half hour or so into the film and then comes and goes after that. His film time ends up being maybe half of the film. The Red Queen is a slightly bigger (pun intended) player in the whole storyline. The well done and creepily compelling characterization by Helena Bonham Carter may never, never leave my psyche.<br /><br />The plot line is a parallel story to the traditional Alice adventure. Some of the plot is familiar like the shrinking and growing Alice, tea parties and beheadings. What's not familiar is an interesting addition to a more grown-up version. The first 15-20 minutes is very low key in the adventure department so don't expect to find yourself plunging immediately into a rabbit hole.<br /><br />I don't know that I'd recommend this film for very sensitive children. Tim Burton and Depp fans may or may not love it. I'd watch it again and probably will but I probably won't own it for regular viewing.</p></body></html>

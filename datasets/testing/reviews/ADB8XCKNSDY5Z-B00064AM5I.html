<meta name="summary" content="Not Bad"></head><body><p>This movie was really silly, but I thought it was quite watchable.  I was impressed actually.  I wouldn't mind watching it again.  Usually I don't like Ben Stiller movies, but I laughed at some of the stuff he did in this one.  I guess it may be because I respect antagonists more than protagonists.<br /><br />The plot in this movie doesn't matter much.  No one cares about it.  This movie is for nothing but cheap laughs.  Fortunately the cheap laughs aren't limited to endless shots of people getting hit in the groin.  There's a whole variety of goofy humor.  My favorite part is the black and white short film on Dodgeball they watch.<br /><br />Sometimes the humor gets a bit silly though.  There's a guy who walks around in the film dressed as a pirate for no reason at all.  I thought the whole pirate thing was the worst part of the movie.  Still, it wasn't enough to tarnish the entire work.<br /><br />I'd recommend checking this out for a rental.  Laugh at some parts and not at others.  Go with the flow.</p></body></html>

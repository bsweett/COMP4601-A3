<meta name="summary" content="The ultimate in zombie terror now on a great DVD set!"></head><body><p>Set after the events of "Night of the Living Dead", the nation is still in chaos with the dead rising from their graves and attacking the living. A group of surviving humans( Ken Foree, Gaylen Ross, Scott H. Reiniger and David Emge) hide out in a shopping mall for shelter armed with weapons, try to radio someone for help and battle out with the undead as they must try to survive as well as trying to fight out some biker thugs.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and an awesome sequel to George Romero's 1968 masterpiece "Night of the Living Dead"! what makes this movie work besides the classic gore and make-up by Tom Savini or the music by Dario Argento & Goblin is the interesting social satire in this movie that it presents. The acting can be amateruish but there is plenty of action and violent scenes in this movie that also helps out in making this one of the greatest horror movies ever made, often imitated ( mostly by Europeans) but never eqauled.<br /><br />This 4-Disc Ultimate Edition DVD set is just as awesome as the movie itself with excellent Divamax digital picture & sound remastering, audio commentaries, trailers, TV Spots, radio spots, Poster and Still galleries, easter eggs, interviews, featurettes, documentarys, and three versions: Original theatrical version, Director's Cut and Euro cut.<br /><br />This is a must have for every horror aficonado's DVD library, highly recommended if you want to see the ultimate in zombie horror.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Day of the Dead", "Evil Dead", "Zombie" ( a.k.a.

As soem 80's film's you watch it's old and the laughs are old but not with this series. The acting is great and the story is great. I loved the first movie it has a great story and it's original. The second film is not good but it's an ok sequal but compared to the first and last one it's bad, the story is confussing at times but at times not. The third and final movie is great and as good as the first, the acting is nott he greatest but it's still great.</p></body></html>

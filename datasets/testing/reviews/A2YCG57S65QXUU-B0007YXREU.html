<meta name="summary" content="A Terrorist's Worst Nightmare! :)"></head><body><p>Team America: World Police is a action-comedy adventure created by the team of Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and done through the magic of marionette puppets. In this sick but brillant political satire, a team of American counter-terrorism fighters battle Islamic extremists throughout the world and giving uptight Hollywood celebrity activists their just desserts, all leading up to the climatic battle pitting Team America against the North Korean butthole dictator Kim Jong-Il. The special features includes a behind-the-scenes look of the film, how the puppets are made, the mini-pyrotechnics display and a closer look at the Kim Jong-Il character. Please note that since it is a unrated version(being the material is different from the R-rated version)of the movie, it not intended for children, it contains explicit language, graphic violence, strong sexual content with puppets and gross perverted humour. Other than that, Team America is a laugh riot that any fan of South Park will enjoy!</p></body></html>

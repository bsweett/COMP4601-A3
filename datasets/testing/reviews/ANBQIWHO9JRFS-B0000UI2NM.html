<meta name="summary" content="Silly, but amusing"></head><body><p>Ah, what can you say about 'Underworld'? Most notably, it needs more action.  The biggest action scene is at the very beginning, and then we've gotta whole lot of plot for a very long time.  The action scenes are, of course, your standard John Woo knockoff, particularly this opening one.  This isn't really a criticism on my part-- If you're gonna knock of a particular action director, Woo is the way to go.  It's also hurt by the fact that the opening action scene is by far the best one in the film.  Ya gotta pace yourself, Underworld!  Still, their just isn't enough killing.  The story elements are amusing in their way, but the balance is way off.<br /><br />Almost equally important, 'Underworld' could really use a sense of humor.  This movie is so silly and yet it takes itself completely seriously which makes it all the more ridiculous.  If it had a bit of intentional, perhaps self-parodic humor I think I could take the whole thing quite a bit more straight-facedly.<br /><br />The best thing about `Underwold' is the way it looks.  The thing only cost like 23 million, and it looks completely gorgeous and totally creates the alternate, neo-gothic world that is 'Underworld'.  This film is a classic indictment of the excessive use of CGI in Hollywood, particularly for sets-- Not only does this film cost a fraction of what something like 'Revenge of the Sith' costs, it also looks WAY better.  It actually looks *real*, cause it mostly is.  It has some CGI stuff, but it holds well to my personal rule that you should always use practical, real world effects when they can do the job.  The werewolves themselves don't look so hot, but they're the only really disappointment, and the whole thing is really quite stunning considering the cost.  It's an intensely blue colored affair, but it fits the film and feels appropriate, so that's fine.  Another minor visual concern is that the film fails to differentiate between the visual nature of the vampires and the werewolves sufficiently.  More specifically, the human form werewolves lack any real particular style; they just kinda wear ratty old coats, for the most part.  The vampires are, of course, your Blade/Matrix style black leather neo-gothic night club vampires, the variant which has become utterly dominant in modern vampire cinema.  It disturbs me to think that there are probably a lot of people my age and younger who just think that this is the way vampires are, period.  Not that I particularly care for classically styled vampires or anything, I just fear they lack any perspective.  Anyway...<br /><br />Performances tend to be wildly over the top, as is de rigeur for modern vampire films.  Bill Nighy is especially fun as the head vampire.  Everyone is pretty hammy, but he really takes it to another level.  Kate Beckinsale is fairly bland, formless protagonist, but, on the other hand, she does spend most of the film in a leather body suit. (This fact which I believe has been mentioned in every review of 'Underworld' yet written, so far be it for me to break tradition.)  I should note that the music is generally overwrought and often irritating.  They used that glass harp or maybe just distant, squealing string sound like a trillion times here and it really gets on my nerves.<br /><br />I found the plot to be vaguely incomprehensible for most of the film, but it all came together eventually, so perhaps this was intentional.  Frankly, I wasn't terribly concerned with the plot.  This is a film you mostly just stare at, impressed half the time, snickering the other half.  The former impression is superior, obviously, but they both work, so it's not a total loss.<br /><br />Grade: C+</p></body></html>

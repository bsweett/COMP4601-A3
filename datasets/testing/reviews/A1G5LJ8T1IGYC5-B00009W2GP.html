LOADED WITH FIRST-CLASS ACTING AND SUPERB ACTION AND SPECIAL EFFECTS, THIS IS ONE HELL OF A FINALE TO THE VERY IMPRESSIVE MATRIX TRILOGY. EVERYONE IN THE CAST GIVES IT THEIR ALL IN THIS ONE. IF YOU LIKED EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GET DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE AND RENT THIS MOVIE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. A MUST FOR ACTION AND SCI-FI FANS.</p></body></html>

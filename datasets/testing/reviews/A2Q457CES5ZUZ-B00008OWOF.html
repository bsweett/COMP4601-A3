<meta name="summary" content="A Genius of Crime"></head><body><p>When the idea for a film surfaced in the creative mind of director Steven Spielberg concerning the amazing activities of Frank Abagnale Jr. there might have been more than a little bit of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu involved.  It was Spielberg who, as a young man fascinated by film, talked his way past Universal Studios security guards to watch films being made.<br /><br />Leonardo Di Caprio as Abagnale Jr. interviews a Pan American Airways supervisor to learn about the careers of their pilots for the ostensible purpose of writing an article for his high school paper.  In reality he is seeking to learn enough about the lives and activities of Pan Am pilots so he can successfully impersonate them.  Couple his skillful impersonations alongside a genius for manufacturing bogus checks and the FBI was left reeling while he drained millions from the banking system.  His cover as a pilot provides him with the opportunity to cash checks in cities all over the world.<br /><br />Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. plummets from a commanding community position as a successful businessman in New Rochelle, New York to a life in which he is compelled to scrap for his next meal.  It all happens after he has troubles with the Internal Revenue Service and winds up under the oppressive yolk of owing a huge amount of money.  After the Abagnales leave their mansion and move into a small apartment the marriage of Walken to his attractive French born wife, whom he had met during World War Two, ends abruptly in divorce.  She promptly marries Walken's lawyer friend from the New Rochelle Rotary Club, played by James Brolin, as Di Caprio's world becomes  shaken.<br /><br />Di Caprio had seen his father engage in shady manipulations, and so he put some of his father's techniques to use along with his own additions.  Soon it becomes obvious that Walken was a rank amateur compared to his son, who has a genius for white-collar crime.<br /><br />The film's dramatic high point and chief story thread is the battle between Di Caprio to stay out of prison and hard working New York FBI agent Tom Hanks to put him there.  Hanks is divorced and so literally married to his job that the white collar criminal is able to consistently reach him in his office on Christmas Eve.  They develop a respect for each other over time, with Hanks admiring Di Caprio's brilliant skills, one of which is master escapist every time that he and his colleagues close in, with the criminal admiring the FBI agent's idealistic tenacity.<br /><br />The film, based on the true life exploits of Abagnale, heads toward the inevitable result of a confrontation where the criminal is arrested.  It happens under the most dramatic circumstances in France.  The story then takes another turn late in the film when the FBI realizes that it can use the criminal's white-collar criminal skills as a means of preventing  future crimes.<br /><br />In real life Abagnale abandoned his criminal ways after doing his time, making large sums of money by consulting the corporate world in the area he knew best, that of security.  Ironically Abagnale began by costing the corporate world millions and ultimately ended up by saving it millions.<br /><br />Martin Sheen has a role as a father whose daughter wants to marry Di Caprio.  The wily young man of many identities meets her as a presumed "emergency room supervising doctor" and then swiftly switches to lawyer after passing the Louisiana State Bar.  He then goes to work as an assistant prosecutor in the office headed by Sheen.</p></body></html>

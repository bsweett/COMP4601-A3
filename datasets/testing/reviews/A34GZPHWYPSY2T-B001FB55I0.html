I mean, they made him up to look like the offspring of a marriage between the original two terminators! They might as well have hung a sign on him!<br /><br />This film is the silliest and most muddled thing I have ever seen. I call this kind of garbage a "gelquel", because it isn't prequel and it isn't sequel except in actual time. To be brief: John Connor (the ever-annoying Christian Bale) is hard at it in the war with Skynet. Inexplicably, his "father", Kyle Reese (a charming Anton Yelchin) is a 16 or 17 year old kid running around alone in Los Angeles. Connor knows he's out there, and that he is a teenager, but....<br /><br />Worthington appears. His determination to "find" someone honks the loud horn that this is a terminator, though as I have said about him before, he is sexy and fun to watch. Not so bad.<br /><br />Forget about trying to understand this over-budgeted time-waster. I'm sure Bale needed the role and the money; Yelchin no doubt needed his role (quite good so naturally it amounts to about 10 minutes total). Worthington needed the exposure as well. That's about it for this thing.<br /><br />All I can point out to the unsuspecting film buff is this movie was less violent and more deserving of a PG than the rotten TRANSFORMERS movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Solid suspense, lacks originality."></head><body><p>The trailers for "The Mist" made me shudder for all the wrong reasons - I thought, "here's Just Another Horror". But now, having seen it, I can report that "The Mist" is - in places, at least, pleasantly surprising, and overall, isn't half as bad as you might think.<br /><br />The plot isn't anything out of the ordinary, and you could be forgiven for assuming that Steven King and screenplay writer Frank Darabont copied and pasted scenes from "The Fog" and "The Birds" to come up with this : Freak storm gives birth to a thick mist blanketing the town, and spews out numerous beasties that corral a group of people in a local supermarket - including David Drayton (Jane) and his son Billy (Gamble), their neighbour Brent Norton (Braugher) and local religious zealot Mrs. Carmody (Gay Harden). Escape seems hopeless and the locals become more and more restless as their numbers slowly decline. Et cetera et cetera. But "The Mist" wisely goes more for a Hitchcock-style suspense feel than a Carpenter all-out-horror motif, and this, frankly, saves the movie from itself.<br /><br />The acting's pretty average, with some good performances (Thomas Jane, Frances Sternhagen and Andre Braugher), some great performances (Marcia Gay Harden, Nathan Gamble) and - of course - some truly lousy performances by histrionic extras ("There's something in the mist!", "It's in the mist!", "No wire hangers ever!", and so forth. Well, maybe not that last one, but you get the picture....). The screenplay (by Frank Darabont) is competent and nicely paced - within fifteen minutes we're in the thick of the action (although this does cause somewhat of a drag around the midway point, but hey, by then you've been watching for an hour, and another hour won't kill you...) - and, histrionic extras' dialogue notwithstanding, the script provides a functional, utilitarian dialogue that forwards a well-made, suspenseful movie. The ending is unexpected and very, very unsettling - and definitely contributes a great deal to my three-star rating.<br /><br />Direction is very good, there's one supermarket-in-chaos sequence just before the movie's mid-point that is very nicely done, and the special effects, surprisingly, are absolutely fantastic. CGI is well-animated and unpretentiously showcased, and while there are one or two points where the beasties look fake, the mist itself is convincing, and the creatures, for the most part, look plausible.<br /><br />The biggest problem with "The Mist" is that it's not very original. I haven't read the story that spawned it, but this movie version doesn't really do anything new. It retreads some very familiar waters with competent polish, though, and if you're in the mood for an undemanding suspense/horror movie with plenty of decent elements to it, this might be just what you're looking for.<br /><br />Recommended for rental - unless you're a huge King fan, in which case this two-disc version is your best bet.</p></body></html>

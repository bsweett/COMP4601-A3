Everything from a three-eyed fish in The Simpsons introductions to a lovely little superstar named Godzilla taught me that as a kid, and the somewhat different style of The Host helped to reinforce that in a way that safety videos never do. Add in a family that doesn't quite get along, a government that doesn't really know what to make of something thrashing around in their rivers, men in bright colors, enough bones to make a fantastic roadkill mixed-media sculpture, and slap on a coat of comedy and you have a pretty little playpen that translates to The Host.<br /><br />While many people don't like to see The Host compared to Godzilla films, it really does have the feel of the late 90s Godzilla with a better budget, a REALLY nice monster, and something that might be pieced together better than some of those movies. The family REALLY evoked the comparisons, especially in the case of the son and the things that happen to him, and the point to the movie was similar to the core of the Godzilla theme. There were a lot more components than the monster in this as well, and the way they to fit into the fold actually surprised me because those things seemed like they would be secondary when I saw the previews and not such good primary focuses.<br /><br />If I had to complain about one thing, it would be that the monster made its guest appearance really suddenly, managed to get me really excited as it did what it did for about twenty minutes or more, and then became a pawn in a game much larger than the beast itself. I guess that was a misgiving of mine while going into the film - still, the way the film was marketed made me think an elderly man with a shotgun and a younger lady with a bow would be throwing down with a beast.<br />That KINDA happened, with a heavy KINDA rolling off my tongue, but not really.<br />In this case, the previews realllly stretch the "what is what."<br /><br />When you see this movie, keep that in mind and don't go into it with the expectation of a monstercentric core. Don't get overly excited when you see the monster, either, and remember that this is Korean Cinema and that it follows some of the same formulas - and flaws - that Korean films normally follow. Korean film reminds me of Hong Kong film a few years ago, when it was still finding strong legs to walk on, in the respect that they are a bit choppy sometimes but that they still haven't found a specific flow. That's good, too, because you don't want a centralized theme in all your movies you want things like The Host to be made. Also bear in mind that it IS also like a Godzilla film in the aspects mentioned earlier, and that those pieces genius when you have a director that knows how to make something great. Combine this with the monster, the mayhem, and a really nice twist and you have a movie that shouldn't be overlooked because it's slinky, sexy, and good.<br />O, and don't watch the dubbing no matter the temptation. Remember the sagely advice of mothers around the world; doing that'll make you go blind!!</p></body></html>

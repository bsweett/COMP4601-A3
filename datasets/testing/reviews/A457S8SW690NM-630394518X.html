<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece"></head><body><p>This movie is absolutely riveting and thrilling. It is sad, as well as freaky at times and is almost as good as the Silence of the Lambs. It isn't a shoot em up thriller as it develops slowly with detectives Sommerset and Mills, played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt who inspect murders, all realting to the seven deadly sins. The movie is very original and has a great performance by Kevin Spacey as the killer, John Doe.<br /><br />It does have lots of disturbing images as well as a pretty freaky plot but is reccomended for anyone who likes good thrillers. This is a scary movie because it could be real, while all of the movies in the horror section like Freddy or Jason are just stupid because it isn't realistic and the killers are invincible. I hope everyone realizes this and doesn't go to see the millions of even worse sequels.<br /><br />On the other hand, Seven is scary and is a masterpiece. This movie has all of the pieces it needs to succeed, from a good cast, to a good plot, to a well executed film, it succeeds in every possible domain. Reccomended to everyone who isn't faint of heart.</p></body></html>

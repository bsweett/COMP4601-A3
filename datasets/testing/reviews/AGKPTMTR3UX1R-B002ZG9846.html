KICK-ASS is a cornball classic that is definitely headed for a kind of immortality as a camp set-up of BATMAN and SPIDER-MAN. It's the story of ordinary Dave Lizewsky of Queens NY, who one day decides to take up the job of local superhero for lack of any other ambitions.<br /><br />Dave has problems being a superhero. Unlike Peter Parker/Spider-Man he has no unnatural super powers (except "being invisible to girls"); he lacks the technological skills of Tony Stark/Ironman; and he has no millions to spend on creating a persona like Bruce Wayne/Batman. Instead, he buys a lime green wetsuit and mask from a sporting goods store, arms himself with a couple of wooden batons which he can barely hold, and names himself "Kick-Ass." He's strictly a bargain-bin superhero.<br /><br />His first "assignment" is to rescue a cat ("Mr. Bitey") from a tree; he falls out and concusses himself. In his second assignment he tries to stop two punks from breaking into a car. They throw him a beating and stab him in the gut. While he's crawling away from the fight he gets struck by a hit and run driver.<br /><br />The run-down is serendipitous. Rendered largely neuropathic from the accident, he feels little pain, and most of his bones are replaced with titanium plates and rods. When he recovers, he goes back to getting a beating for crime, this time trying to break up a street fight. It's a draw, but someone posts the video online, and overnight, Kick-Ass becomes a folk hero for tryng to save the victim.<br /><br />What nobody knows is that two real superheroes, "Big Daddy" (in a Batman-like costume) and his sass-mouthed, weapons-qualified preteen daughter "Hit Girl" (think a four-foot Robin with purple hair) are terrorizing a gang of mobsters.<br /><br />In the meantime, Kick-Ass is reveling in his fame and enjoying his sweet new girlfriend. What he doesn't know is that the mobsters think he is the superhero who has been tormenting them. They try to lure him out by baiting him with a possible sidekick "Red Mist" (the superheroic names in this movie are intentionally lame), and this leads to the grand battle between Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, and Hit Girl on one side and Red Mist and the mobsters on the other.<br /><br />By far the best character is not Kick-Ass himself, but Hit Girl. One 17 year old character announces his plan to save himself for her; a reviewer says he wants to adopt her. Noble sentiments all.</p></body></html>

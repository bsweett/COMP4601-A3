No matter what happens between today and that date with destiny, he will be able to look back to "Pan's Labyrinth" and say with confidence that he made one of the Great Movies.<br /><br />"PL" tells the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a twelve-year old girl condemned to live during the final years of the Spanish civil war.  Her father is dead, and her mother is pregnant by the dastardly Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez).  Vidal commands that Ofelia and her mother come to live with him at his Fascist outpost in the Navarre mountains as he attempts to wipe out the local rebels.<br /><br />Ofelia has retreated from the horrors of the world to become lost in the world of fairy tales, and so she is better equipped than most when a fairy visits her one night.  The fairy leads her to a labyrinth in the garden behind the country house, where Ofelia learns that she is the daughter of the king of the Underworld.  In order to reclaim her immortality, she must perform three specific tasks, each of which will test her courage to the utmost.<br /><br />All the while, Vidal carries out a brutal campaign against the rebels.  Guillermo stresses the barbarity of the war without overdoing it . . . almost.  Further straining the nerves of the audience, there are more than a few spies working within the walls of Vidal's outpost, including the gorgeous kitchen maid Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of "Y Tu Mama Tambien" fame) and the noble Dr. Ferreiro (Alex Angulo).<br /><br />Del Toro has created a movie of visual splendor, even though much of the movie shows the horrors of war.  You have all seen the spectacular monster with eyeballs in his hands, but there are plenty of other visual delights.  I had thought that I would never see as beautiful a movie about war as Jean-Pierre Jeunet's "A Very Long Engagement," but "PL" gives that movie a run for its money.<br /><br />But more than visual delights, "PL" is a serious movie about courage in the face of the darkest adversity.  Even though this is fantasy, Ofelia faces perils in both the real world and the fantastic that far exceed anything Harry Potter ever faces.  Indeed, the risks Ofelia runs in real life make the fantastic threats to her life that much more dire.  Do not be misled by the youthful leading lady to think that just any child can watch "PL" and not have nightmares.  Children should see this movie, but only when they are mature enough - I strongly recommend watching this before you let your kids see it.<br /><br />Congratulations to the entire team for making such a wonderful movie.  It's rare that the fantasy genre gets such mature treatment - if more stories like "PL" saw the light of day (and fewer Tolkien clones), the fantasy genre would not be shunted off to one side and would be considered serious fare.  What a movie!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Brave One"></head><body><p>Although we have seen many vigilante movies, this one takes a very different approach. First it is a woman that is wronged by a gang that kills her fiance. But even though she goes after them, this movie is as much about her psychological changes as the acts of vengence. Well thought out screenplay with excellent character development. This is not at all in a class with the Bronson or other vigilante movies. Jodie Foster as always is a consumate actress and pulls off another unforgettable dramatic performance as a radio jock with a show about her feelings for New York City. Even after her change to a stranger that executes killers she reaches out to the city. Terrence Howard does a fine job as the cop pursueing the vigilante. Good quality DVD and fair replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Panic Room", "Red Eye", and "Flightplan". - C. Luster</p></body></html>

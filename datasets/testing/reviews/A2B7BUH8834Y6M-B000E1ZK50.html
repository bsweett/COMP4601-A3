The special effects were truly awesome and on a number of occasions I was truly startled by the sudden appearance and/or sound of one of the ghouly creatures.<p>When Bela Lagosi addressed Van Helsing by name in the 1930s Dracula film, the actor was a Sigmund Freud-like older distinguished gentleman. In this 2004 rendition, Van Helsing is a young, fearless, monster-butt-kicking machine, and quite a bit easier on the eyes.<p>He is seen first in the movie in a battle with Mr. Hyde (Dr. Jekyl's counterpart) - rendered unlike I have ever seen in any film. He is truly larger than life - an enormous hulk who is more agile than a spider monkey.  In the 1880s, before lycra and spandex, one has to wonder where a guy who could use Andre the Giant as a Q-Tip gets pants. He certainly couldn't wander the streets of London and amble into a tailor's shop to get measured.<p>Tongue-in-cheek humor is peppered through-out the film, but is so cheesy, it is not potent enough to evoke more than a chuckle. A friar who accompanies Van Helsing in his quest to vanquish Dracula and his vampire harem is a poor copy of Martin Short. His presence is needed as a comedic element to keep the film from being too dark. He's supposedly a mechanical &amp; chemical engineering genius, making all sorts of fascinating weapons and explosives, but he's otherwise portrayed as a joking bafoon.<p>Not only is the CGI flawless, the way in which the vampires, wolfmen and Mr. Hyde are depicted is truly innovative and unique. The last member of a cursed family (Kate Beckinsale) is the romantic element for Van Helsing. Even though the action is supposed to take place in 1888, this Transylvania princess is dressed like a modern day sex kitten, clad in leather pants, fashionable suede boots and a Glamour Shots ? hairdo that looks flawless even when she's swinging from a rope.<p>The vistas are beautiful as the viewer is taken across grand mountains in Europe, great plains and lush forests. For all that is in this film, it's sad that it wasn't better. Don't get me wrong, this was an enjoyable flick, but solely because of the extraordinary CGI and butt-kicking. <p>There are a number of scenes that are total rip-offs from &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot; which made me laugh out loud due to the insultingly overdone cheese.<p>The ending is a Hallmark moment that will make anyone nauseated... not to mention it's a close rip-off of the ending in Return of the Jedi - Darth Vader's body on a funerary pyre, the spirits of Obi Wan, Anakin and Yoda smiling and nodding to Luke, and the festive song that plays in the background. Please do not make me sick to my stomach, Van Helsing!! <p>The ending credits are truly an amazing feat - and just listing who was starring in the film - those ending credits probably cost a lot more than my house. If there is an Oscar? category for ending credits, Van Helsing has it coming - but for the rest of the film, it's a candidate for a Razzie.<p>For the vistas and CGI, it's worthwhile watching on the big screen - once. I never have to see this cheese-fest again.</p></body></html>

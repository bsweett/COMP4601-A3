GRIN"></head><body><p>Hey, they always said that sequels never quite measured up to the movie they follow--but this has got to be the MAJOR exception to the rule. The movie grabs your attention the very instant it starts and it never fails to entertain.<br /><br />The acting is magnificent and it's obvious that the cast worked their little tushies off! GRIN Tobey Maguire shines again as Peter Parker, who when he's not Spiderman is the "Everyman" who is stuck in a rotten, very low paying job, having problems committing to his girl because he can't tell her he's Spiderman, and he's not exactly able to afford a nice home, either. Yet he possesses such incredible powers! He is Spiderman yet incredibly enough he can't make up his mind if he should continue on as both Peter Parker and Spiderman. Should he hang up his Spiderman uniform, he wonders? Great acting here! Equally true, Alfred Molina cannot fail when he is cast as the tragic but evil villain Doc Ock. Parker must choose between fighting evil Doc Ock in his role as Spiderman or settling instead for a MUCH more meager existence as Peter Parker and Peter Parker alone. Worse yet, Peter Parker is also challenged by The Green Goblin once over again played by William Defoe. Kirsten Dunst also is cast so well as Peter's girlfriend Mary Jane; their chemistry is awesome! Again the acting is totally convincing and a real treat to enjoy. Don't forget to look for the train scene! GRIN<br /><br />And yet there's MORE! The DVD is loaded--really loaded--with great extras! There's a technical commentary, a "Spidey Sense 2" pop-up trivia track, a blooper reel, a 12 (yes, TWELVE) part documentary on how they made the film, and a little special something called "Ock-umentary: Eight Arms to Hold You!" SMILE There are quite a few other extras as well.<br /><br />The picture and sound quality are excellent and the DVD 2 disc set is nicely packaged. SO, with the holiday season upon us, who could resist getting a copy of this film? Give yourself and the people you care about a much deserved present this year! I guarantee you won't regret it! And by the way, can we get a Spiderman 3 soon in the new year? GRIN</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A DVD release worthy of the original David Lean epic"></head><body><p>This is an epic and powerful tale, both an international political thriller and an interpersonal drama about the amazing character T.E. Lawrence.  Lawrence of Arabia is a masterpiece that manages to impart an important history lesson in addition to some outstanding cinematography, brilliant acting by Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and Sir Alec Guinness, beautiful landscape vistas, many quotable exchanges, and an intense character study of the conflicted T.E. Lawrence.<br /><br />Lawrence of Arabia is famous for its length, and having heard so much about the duration of the film, I was concerned about my own attention span.  To my surprise and delight, the movie was never plodding or drawn out.  Every scene served an important function.  Even the long desert-passage tale was purposeful, conveying to the viewer just how arduous and trying the journey was.<br /><br />Despite its well-deserved critical acclaim and historical significance, Lawrence of Arabia is not without its drawbacks.  It has a mediocre soundtrack, some laughable special effects (the quicksand scene), and night scenes that are fuzzy due to the lack of proper lenses and equipment.  I think the film is even greater due to these warts and imperfections.  Some reviewers have commented that the lack of any credible female characters (outside some tribeswomen in a group shot) is a drawback, but I couldn't disagree more.  The lack of a female lead makes the movie great, because it is realistic, and not contrived to some Hollywood standard movie formula.  Where do women fit into an early 1900's war, into a culture that oppresses women, and into the life of a homosexual military man?  The filmmakers should be applauded for not trying to fit a female lead into a movie which is about men.<br /><br />This is one of the all-time best movies in American cinema.  Don't miss out on this outstanding DVD release.</p></body></html>

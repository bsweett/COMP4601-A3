<meta name="summary" content="The best horror film of the 20th century (to date)"></head><body><p>It is not so much that &quot;28 Days Later...&quot; is a classic horror film, but that this 2003 effort is heads and shoulders above the schlock that fans of the genre have had to endure so far this century.  Even when a horror film has a good (&quot;Ghost Ship&quot;) or great (&quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;) opening, the rest of the film and the payoff end up being disappointing.  The payoff for &quot;28 Days Later...&quot; is a debatable element as well, especially when director Danny Boyle offers an alternative theatrical ending as well as an additional ending that basically combines the first two on the DVD.  You will have to decide that offering different endings, one of which you will have to like a lot more than the other, is ultimately a good thing or a bad thing.<p>The prologue of the film begins with televised images of rioting in the streets, but the main show has not begun yet.  Instead we are watching a chimpanzee that is being subjected to all this media violence in a medical testing facility somewhere in England.  A group of animal activists arrive to document the treatment of the chimps and to set them free, which they do, despite the frantic protests of one of the lab's scientists who explains the animals have been infected with a &quot;rage&quot; virus.  Of course the do-gooders do not listen and 28 days later Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital bed from a coma, having been hit by a car, and discovers everybody is gone.  <p>In a series of chilling shots, Jim makes his way through a deserted London, finding only bits and pieces of information in scattered newspapers about a virus that has forced the evacuation of the city.  In a corpse filled church he meets an apparent survivor, but there is clearly something wrong and it is only when Jim is rescued by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) that they explain the bad news.  These are, for the purposes of this film, the rules of the game and they are straightforward and simple enough to make this horror film work.  <p>After all, the obvious comparison here is with &quot;Night of the Living Dead,&quot; where the dead rose to become flesh-eating zombies because the earth passed through the tail of a comet.  Since minimal direct contact with fluids carrying the virus result in someone becoming &quot;infected&quot; in 10-20 seconds, I keep thinking that most of these people are ghouls rather than zombies, but correct categorization is not an imperative here.  Unlike the slow, doddering zombies of George A. Romero's film, the infected are more manic and considerably more violent.  Still, it is impossible to forget that black &amp; white classic, especially when it comes to believing that our small band of heroes are going to get out of this with any of them being alive.<p>After Mark becomes the obligatory first fatality, making it clear how quickly people turn and that the only way of dealing with it is to kill the infected person P.D.Q., Jim and Selena team up with the unlikely team of cab driver Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns).  Having picked up a repeating radio message that the answer for infection can be found at a military post outside of Manchester (a scene that will remind older viewers of a sub-plot in the film &quot;On the Beach&quot;), the quartet head out of town to see if they can find other survivors.  Meanwhile, high up in the stratosphere an airliner passes overhead, a sign that the normal world is out there somewhere, but that England is a quarantined land.<p>The fact that the last part of &quot;28 Days Later...&quot; turns into more of an action film strikes some viewers as odd, but the situation is comparable to &quot;Aliens,&quot; where you can slaughter dozens of the bad guys because they are not considered human, a free pass to mondo blood-letting and lots of gore in the logic of contemporary movie making.  At the heart of it all is the attempt of the main characters, a family unit forged out of necessity and fear, to keep alive.  Our ability to relate to their situation is what makes this film work, which is why the cast are unfamiliar faces, as in &quot;The Blair Witch Project.&quot;  The effective rock score by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle are other strong elements as well.<p>For the record, I think the alternative theatrical ending provides the strongest ending.  That version is at least a 4.5 and I round up to make it clear that &quot;28 Days Later...&quot; is the top choice for discerning horror film fans who are looking for something that will turn their stomach...in a good way.</p></body></html>

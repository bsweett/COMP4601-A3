The daring duo of George Clooney and Brad Pitt team up for a third time to destroy the business of a bad guy who bilked their friend out of his half interest in the glitziest hotel on the Strip.  Ocean's 13 has more movie magic than ever--my term for impossible feats that seem absurdly easy to pull off or plot points that don't make sense--but no one should care. Somehow these wildly successful movies work their charm without sex, abusive language or violence. One can quibble with whether it's better or worse than 12--but who really cares? These movies are just good fun--period.</p></body></html>

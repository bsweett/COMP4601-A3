<meta name="summary" content="3,000 Years of Terror Will Be Unleashed..."></head><body><p>In the late 90's, Universal Studios decided it was time to dust off their famous monsters of old, and give them a face-lift in order to give thrills and chills to the new generation of moviegoers that never experienced them during their peak.  To accomplish this task, Universal tapped a relatively unknown director named Stephen Sommers to rejuvenate their famous monster the mummy.  So, with basically a rookie director, a lofty budget, and a decently big name star in Brendan Fraser, Universal put a lot of faith and clout behind their remake of "The Mummy".  But one problem still remains with this remake, can it possibly impress the older generation that grew up on the original, and can it muster enough thrills for the newer, more jaded generation?<br /><br />"The Mummy" is the story of a 3,000 year old force of terror being unleashed upon Egypt.  The mummy (Arnold Vosloo) is a former Egyptian priest named Imhotep, who betrayed the pharoah when he struck up an affair with the pharoah's wife, and as punishment both Imhotep and his love were placed in a cursed tomb where they would forever remain.  That is until a team of explorers lead by Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) accidentally release the monster upon Egypt.  As if the monster wasn't enough to deal with, Egypt is bombarded by plagues of Biblical proportion that seem to follow the mummy wherever he goes.  Can Rick and Evie save Egypt from the mummy's wrath, or will they become part of his unwitting legion of zombies?  Time will tell.<br /><br />Though expectations for "The Mummy" were decent, there was still plenty of skepticism surrounding the possible success of the remake.  Earlier I posed the question that was present in many people's minds in regards to this film, could this remake even hope to equal the original film and impress both old and new generations of moviegoers?  The answer, a resounding yes for both.  Based on huge box office numbers and critical praise, it was clear that Universal's gamble to resurrect their monsters of old was not a mistake.  With the success of the film, actors Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz were propelled to super-stardom, and it wasn't long before the offers started rolling in.  The two lead actors weren't the only ones benefiting from the huge success of "The Mummy", director Stephen Sommers showed off his knack for special effects extravaganzas, and found himself in charge of a budding new franchise for Universal Studios, not a bad way to boost a career.  Alongside the live actors in the film, the special effects team at George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic, were given the daunting task of creating a realistic-looking CGI mummy.  No small task by any means, but the creative team pulled it off stunningly, along with the CGI creation of the mummy, ILM handled all of the special effects work for the film, all with outstanding results by the way.  For a remake, an all to common theme in Hollywood these days, Universal sure chose wisely and managed to avoid the most common pitfall of remakes, the fact that most can't even come close to matching the original in any way, shape, or form.  Clearly "The Mummy" is the exception to what has long been the rule.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good blockbuster movie with plenty of humor, thrills, and even a few chills, then do yourself a favor and watch this enjoyable film that rejuvenated the Hollywood monster movie genre and started a franchise in the process.<br /><br />"The Mummy" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Allegorical Fantasy"></head><body><p>I recently saw this film again after five years, and I stand amazed: it appears, if anything, even more elegant, well designed, and timely than it did in 2005.  With its gorgeously photographed locations, seamless effects, simple yet ambitious physical design, and engaging performances, this movie has withstood several years much better than most can, or ever will.  And its allegory has the potential to instruct children without lecturing them.<br /><br />Director Andrew Adamson creates both the British Blitz and his beleaguered fantasy world with such unassuming grace that it can take effort to recall that these places don't exist in our modern age.  His young actors inhabit both locales with a simple grace, as though they don't realize they are doing anything exceptional.  I never got the feeling of watching a historical pageant or school play, as with prior productions.<br /><br />Beside Peter Jackson's LOTR movies and the Harry Potter films, Narnia marks a reassuring trend in cinematic fantasy: directors depict wonder without childish naivet&eacute;, and they capture the grim underpinnings of magic without maudlin dystopia.  These changes in how films depict fantasy reflect, I think, a more balanced view of reality.  And since Lewis intended viewers to learn something about real life, I think he would approve of this development.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Grand Triumph"></head><body><p>This is another grand triumph for director Ron Howard on the level of his big hit of the eighties, &quot;Cocoon,&quot; and another Oscar caliber performance by Russell Crowe, who dug within himself for the last ounce of intensity and feeling.  &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; provides the trials and tribulations of a man who is exceedingly gifted on the one hand, while riddled with problems on the other.  Crowe does a superb job of balancing the highs and the lows of Nobel economics laureate John Forbes Nash, whose gifts in mathematics coincide with his schizophrenia.<p>Jennifer Connelly blends into the story mix with her highly supportive role of Crowe's wife.  When his long, hard struggle with adversity culminates in the Nobel Prize the emotional highlight of the film arises when Crowe looks into the audience and exclaims, while staring directly at Connelly, that he never could have realized his achievement without love.  He was paying his wife the highest tribute for her unflagging cooperation in the wake of adversity.<p>In dealing with a subject such as schizophrenia, Howard was confronted with the decision of just how to approach it.  He decided on a communicative vehicle that was highly cinematic and enriching in terms of understanding the man and his difficulties.  Howard presents dramatic sequences which Crowe as Nash was convinced actually occurred, even though they were imagined and were an integral part of his schizophrenia.  Ed Harris assumes the role of a master handler leading his subject to clandestine activities, the goal preventing the Soviets from unleashing their powerful nuclear arsenal against America.  Crowe also encounters a happy go lucky roommate who ultimately teaches literature at Harvard, a boozy, &quot;let's enjoy life&quot; intellectual with a reverence for D.H. Lawrence.  His irreverence and &quot;What's the difference?&quot; insouciance is a welcome contrast for Crowe to his own often tragic formality.  Crowe then meets the former roommate's young niece, for whom he quickly develops an affinity.  We then find out from Crowe's psychiatrist, played with just the proper note of empathic sensitivity by Christopher Plummer, that Crowe had no roommate while at Princeton!<p>Another interesting aspect of the film is the recognition by Crowe as Nash that he is truly different from other people.  &quot;We're a couple of odd ducks,&quot; he tells Connelly his student, girlfriend, and ultimately loyal wife.  We see how he copes with social awkwardness in his quest to become the best mathematician he can be.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good cast; Disappointing story"></head><body><p>It's interesting that The Prestige and The Illusionist came out so closely together.  I saw The Illusionist in the theater and totally loved it.  I just saw The Prestige now, having borrowed it from the public library.  I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.<br /><br />The cast is first rate.  Any film that features Michael Caine and David Bowie is probably worth seeing.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were both very good.  The performances kept me watching.<br /><br />The inclusion of Nichola Tesla and his battle with Thomas Edison was interesting and one could say that their rivalry mirrored that of the two magicians here.  What bothered me most was the ending.  It was a cheap trick and it spoiled the whole movie for me.  What a contrast with the inspired ending of The Illusionist.<br /><br />In a nutshell, The Prestige is about hate; The Illusionist is about love!</p></body></html>

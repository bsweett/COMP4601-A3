<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful Special Effects"></head><body><p>Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow is a beautiful science fiction movie. Just sit back, and look at the screen. The story is good. But theres not much chance for the outstanding actors do alot of actual acting - they more or less pose for the camera.<br /><br />But even so, I really did liked the movie. The film itself takes you back in time, and the special effects are amazing.</p></body></html>

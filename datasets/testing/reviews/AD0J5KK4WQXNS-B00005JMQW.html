<meta name="summary" content="Sam Raimi is the one to thank!"></head><body><p>Spider-Man 2 is better than most other superhero movies you have seen, not because the comic and hero makers are still alive to help carry Hollywood through those taxing story hurdles, but because director Sam Raimi is at the helm, period. If Spider-Man 2 suffers from anything, then obviously it is a restricted budget (seen in the budget CGI effects of the first outing) because Raimi was a relatively unknown director with only a big list of unknown films (Evil Dead movies) behind him. If anything blame the studios for throwing an extra 30 million in the direction of 10 Direct to DVD moves you never watched last year.<br /><br />Spider-Man 2 takes off from where the first one almost left off, Mary Jane is still the love Peter Parker can not have, the new Green Goblin/ Hobgoblin is in the making, Aunt May copes with the loose of her husband and we learn some new things about her life and where it is going, Dr. Octavius is in town for a science class and more of The Daily Bugle means Spider-Man 2 is almost like watching a re-run of the first, with the side story that when Parker becomes depressed he looses he powers. Thus when the bad guys start winning more, Parker starts to loose his powers more. It is a very good new character development in Spider-Man's abilities to fight crime.<br /><br />I quite like the character of Dr. Octopus. What Raimi does with his character towards the end is very interesting. Most Superhero movies are about bad vs good. Here Raimi does fallen good guys vs mutant good guys. The CGI effects in this opus are a notch up or two from the last one. It is just such a shame that Spider-Man is not getting the credit that the studio should have given it from the start.</p></body></html>

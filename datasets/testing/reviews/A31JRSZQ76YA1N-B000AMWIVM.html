[with due respect to "7"].... a thoroughly nasty little journey through the mind of the severely unhinged ....<br /><br />Fave moments??  The gal wearing the Hannibal Lecter {literally} ripoff mask [with a vague difference].<br /><br />FOR sheer perversion we should receive a sequel [unlikely] but wouldn't it be fun???<br /><br />NOT to be missed ~ especially the beloved puppets!<br /><br />REALLY something for the extremely 'shunned'.<br /><br />GREAT moments aplenty ........</p></body></html>

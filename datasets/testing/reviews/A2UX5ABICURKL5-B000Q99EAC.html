<meta name="summary" content="Stallone returns to give us a new lesson in life...Never Stop Fighting!!"></head><body><p>Stallone returns as a retired boxer given one more change for greatness & glory.<br />This movie is closer to the original cause he's not some star anymore he's in the real world again.<br />His wife has died & he runs a Italian restaurant, bet you couldn't have guessed that one...lol<br />So he given another chance to fight as a warm up fight, but he gives the new champ a run for his money.<br />With his son in his corner Rocky comes out on top again.<br />I rate this Movie a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></body></html>

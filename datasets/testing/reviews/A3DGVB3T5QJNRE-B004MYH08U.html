<meta name="summary" content="The Green Hornet Is So Bad I Had To Walk Out!"></head><body><p>My time is precious and I won't hesitate to salvage every minute I can instead of wasting another second on such a fowl film!<br /><br />The Green Hornet had the feel of a TV sitcom. I could absolutely care less about any of the characters. The dialog was so bad it was incredibly annoying. The story is so poorly written the best actors in the world would not have made any difference! The Green Hornet was dull, unimaginative, tedious; and what a waste of money during a recession! But I'm glad to report that on a Friday night - in a big city like Baltimore - only a handful of people were in the theater! The only way to stop rip-off films from being made is not to pay to see them! I used to be a regular movie goer, but not anymore! After seeing the Green Hornet, I think I will continue spending my hard-earned money on good books instead of wasting it on trash like the Green Hornet!<br /><br />See: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061806293">Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies: A Film Critic's Year-Long Quest to Find the Worst Movie Ever Made</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0740763660">Your Movie Sucks</a></p></body></html>

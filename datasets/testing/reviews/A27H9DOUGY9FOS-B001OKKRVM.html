<meta name="summary" content="Man, And I Thought Our Mating Rituals Were a Nuisance"></head><body><p>By now, we all know that "March of the Penguins" is one of the most popular documentaries in the history of film.  It's theatrical gross set new box office records--and I think I know why.<br /><br />People like penguins--they're pretty darn cute.<br /><br />That being said, this is an impressive film documenting the mating cycle of the Emperor Penguins.  The march and subsequent 8 months dedicated to the process of mating, hatching, and rearing their young is exhausting!  And we're treated to a close-up view thanks to director Luc Jacquet.  That is the most awe-inspiring part of "March," the camera glides within the penguin habitat giving us an unprecedented look at the ritual.  And this is one painstaking effort!  You won't believe how close the shots get, how intricately you can be a part of this delicate process.  In fact, the camera work and cinematography are really what distinguish this from other nature films.<br /><br />The film is aided by a hip narration by Morgan Freeman--that voice was made for this kind of stuff.  There are some whimsically cute moments, some scary, some tragic--it's a nicely detailed portrait of life and death.  Interesting for adults, educational for kids--this is definitely a recommended effort.  KGHarris, 11/06.</p></body></html>

While there have been some excellent movies based on comic books, I had never even heard of Hellboy until recently, and did not have high hope.  But the trailer for Hellboy 2 was so entertaining, that I figured I needed to give Hellboy a try.<br /><br />What a surprise!  Hellboy is a light-hearted action-horror film (there's a new genre for you!).  It is filled with action and suspense, yet it is also filled with comedy and charm.  This movie does not try to take itself too seriously.  My guess is that it comes pretty close to the comic books, and does not try to be "more".<br /><br />Ron Perlman truly shines as Hellboy, bright red skin, horns, and all. The tender scenes between Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair) (fire-starter and love interest) are sweet and funny.  Doug Evans is very engaging as Abe Sapien, Hellboy's friend and partner. John Hurt is excellent as Hellboy's "father."  Another standout is Jeffery Tambor as Hellboy's boss. He is a real jerk throughout most of the film, and you just plain don't like him.  But near the end, the "Thank You" scene between these two actors is dead-pan perfection.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie about good verses evil, where the (unlikely) superhero makes a difficult choice, and still gets the girl in the end.  As I said before, I had no idea what to expect, and wasn't even sure that I would like it.  But, there is something quite appealing and charming about this film; it almost sneaks up on you.  I highly recommend that you give it a try.</p></body></html>

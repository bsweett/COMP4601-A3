<meta name="summary" content="Some amazing visuals and an interesting if somewhat depressing story"></head><body><p>You will see things in this movie you have never seem before. The action is done in new and interesting ways. The plot is interesting (especially for what is really an action flick) and will keep you involved all the way through.<br /><br />All of the actors give very good performances and though the special effects are quite amazing they are used in the service of the story. One little example is the animated cereal box that irritates Anderton (Tom Cruise) so he chucks it across the room. The point is on Anderton not the box even though that effect is interesting. There are many many many effects like that in this movie.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the movie a great deal there were a couple or three scenes that caused me real discomfort. I think (and feel free to disagree with me on this) that some things in this movie aren't for people under sixteen even though it is rated PG-13 it does have some sexual scenes that while not overt would make me uncomfortable with my 14 year old with me.<br /><br />I liked the movie enough to want it to be a big success, but not enough to tell my kids to go see it. I think it is a better movie that "Sum of All Fears" which I also liked, but I would rather my kids saw that movie. This movie is an action movie, but has enough of a point to almost be a serious piece - it really is that interesting. However, it pulls back from a serious examination of the points it raises - but that isn't the point of this movie, is it?<br /><br />It IS really an action movie, so let's not begrudge it its true nature. Don't get too bent out of shape at the gaps in the logic of the plot. As in all noir films, there is FUN to be had in all the movie misery and pain (which woludn't be fun in real life).<br /><br />But if you love an involved and interesting story, and relish seeing things you haven't seen before this is a good movie for you. Just beware of that it will be a rough ride at a couple of spots along the way.</p></body></html>

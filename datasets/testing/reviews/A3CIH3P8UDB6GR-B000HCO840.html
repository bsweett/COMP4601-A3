I will say this movie was good, kept my attention and i was like jaw dropping, and in awe when certain things happen (dont want to give it away) I thought this was a good movie, but as for one part of the movie, i was like "What the blue heeba buh jeeba is going on?" lol but it kept me wanting MORE!! It was like "Oh my, what's next?"  Great film in that aspect, but I recommend this!</p></body></html>

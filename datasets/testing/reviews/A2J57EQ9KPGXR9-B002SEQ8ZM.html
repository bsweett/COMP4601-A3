<meta name="summary" content="Another Neil Gaiman Masterpiece Brought to the Big Screen"></head><body><p>What a wonderful surprise Coraline turned out to be. I was a little apprehensive to view another Tim Burton movie due to the creepiness of Willie Wonka but I was happy to see that Coraline is nothing like that film. Full of charm and heart, Neil Gaiman's Coraline is the story of a girl who gets drawn into a seemingly wonderful fantasy world when she rebels against her every-day life pre-occupied parents.<br /><br />The stop-motion animation is put to full use in this film and adds to quirky fantasy. There are some scary moments in this film that may be too much for small kids but overall this is a very child-centric movie.<br /><br />One of the best animated films to come out in a while, Coraline is well worth your time and $$.</p></body></html>

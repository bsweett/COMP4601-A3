That Eastwood would tackle a subject like this is ambitious and challenging, but trying to keep it intelligent and interesting seemed to be a bit of a problem, The characters -- at least the main characters -- are well fleshed-out, and their experiences were, I thought, well done. Howard's character may have been necessary for George's character development, but was ultimately annoying and overreactive; perhaps a more of a serious persona would've worked better. It also would have been nice to see a bit more resolution at the end. This isn't the type of film that can end all tied up in ribbon, but again, a little more resolution would've done a lot toward making it a better overall story.</p></body></html>

They're releasing THIS on Blu-Ray?!?!?"></head><body><p>Make no mistake: THE BLACK DAHLIA, directed by Brian De Palma, one of history's very worst successful directors, is one of the WORST FILMS EVER MADE. I'm not terribly prone to hyperbole, but I can honestly say that this is a film where the whole thing should have ended up on the cutting-room floor... scratch that... this film should have been BURNED. I'm not going to bore you with the details, but I am going to say a few things.<br /><br />De Palma returns to the glory of films like WISE GUYS, SNAKE EYES, BODY DOUBLE, and MISSION TO MARS and creates yet another feature film that is absolutely bereft of anything resembling talent, style, or depth.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart is wasted, Josh Hartnett is dead-eyed and pathetic, Scarlett Johansson is suffering from Actor's Block, and Hilary Swank... hmm... what can I say about a film where Hilary Swank, a woman who has won Oscars for playing a woman pretending to be a man and a butch female boxer, plays the 'alluring, sensual femme fatale'?!?!?!?!??!!?!?<br /><br />De Palma has one great film and one good film to his resume: THE UNTOUCHABLES (Great, but it has little to do with him, but with the great performances and the David Mamet script) and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (Good, but he got the right group of talented people around him). SCARFACE works only as a comedy. Yes, I said it. The film that so many alpha-males worship is GARBAGE as a straight-up drama. But if you take it like SHOWGIRLS and refuse to take it seriously, you will be very amused. But THE BLACK DAHLIA isn't even in the "so bad, it's good" category. It's just very very very very bad.<br /><br />But that's about all I can say on a family-oriented website about this film. If you buy this film, or even enjoy it, you may need serious help, and I'm sure there's an 800 number you can call.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="5 STAR MOVIE, 5 STAR DVD!!!"></head><body><p>"The Wrath of Khan" is definitely one of the best of the series.  It has everything going for it: A first-rate plot with exciting space battles (the final confrontation in the Mutara Nebula is very suspenseful).  Great acting & character development.  Fantastic special effects.  A superb soundtrack by James Horner, one of the greatest film composers of all time.  It folds out as no less than a science-fiction triumph.<p> "The Director's Edition" DVD is one of the best DVD's I own.  Like the Director's Edition of "The Motion Picture", (but with far superior picture quality) it sprouts new transfer and sound.  And it also has about five minutes worth of new/expanded scenes.  The interviews with the cast and production crew are interesting and very funny.  The other documentaries are also very worthwhile.<p> HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!! BUY IT NOW!!!</p></body></html>

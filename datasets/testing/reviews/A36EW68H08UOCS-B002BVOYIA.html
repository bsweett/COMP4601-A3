The film is efficient in its story-telling and we are told early that there has been tension ever since the Belgians left because when the Belgian colonists first came to Rwanda they arbitrarily divided up the native Africans into the more elegant and fair-skinned Tutsis and the darker, broader-nosed Hutus.  The Belgians gave a measure of power to the small amount of Tutsi's, and after Belgium leaves the tensions escalate.<br /><br />Rusesabagina is a Hutu, married to a Tutsi (in a wonderful performance by Sophie Okonedo).  A peace agreement is quickly ignored, the Rwandan President's plane is shot from the sky, and the Hutu's are driven by voices of hatred to "Cut the Tall Trees" - a chilling phrase we are told early on is a "signal" for Hutus to murder Tutsis.<br /><br />Rusesabagina opens the doors of the Mille Collines to everyone, most significantly to terrified and hiding Tutsis.  Don Cheadle is the heart and soul of this movie, and we are amazed as we watch him save 1,200 lives by bribing, pleading, outsmarting and standing up to the murderous forces that come to the Mille Collines.  There are several astonishing scenes where Paul essentially shames white Europeans and his Rwandan staff into "doing the right thing".  At one point he is quite certain that the hotel is about to be over-run and everyone inside murdered.  He is incredibly calm as he phones the Belgian headquarters of his hotel company (a brief, but effective cameo by the wonderful Jean Reno) and thanks the company for what they have done, then informs him that they are about to all be killed.<br /><br />Nick Nolte brings the right combination of fear and fearlessness to the role of the Canadian Colonel representing the United Nations, leading a tiny force of UN "peacekeepers, not peacemakers" - he and his troops have their hands tied.<br /><br />This film effectively displays the irrationality of hate crimes and genocide.  The accompanying documentaries are enlightening showing the real Paul Rusesabagina, and we get a sense that the heroism shown in the movie is no exaggeration.  We are also chillingly reminded that genocide is ongoing in Africa (at present in the Congo and Sudan).  The challenge is plainly issued for the world to step up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Action flows nicely"></head><body><p>Wes Craven did a pretty good job with the suspense movie (as opposed to what he's known best for - horror).  At just about an hour and a half, Red Eye is an enjoyable view, the plot is clear, the action flows swiftly, and the ending tied up the plot quite nicely, bringing about a satisfying conclusion.  (Now, if only Hollywood would take notice and trim the two-and-a-half hour snooze-fests that stretch the storyline beyond reasonable limits...)<br /><br />It was great to see people exactly my age who are able to get the viewer to suspend belief for the duration of the movie and take you into the world of their character.  Cillian Murphy was the perfect villain and Rachael Mc Adams the perfect victim.  Murphy played his part so well that you wanted to scream because he had all his bases covered before he stepped on that plane.  And it was nice to see Lisa (Mc Adams) play by Jack's rules and get the best of him in the end.<br /><br />Red Eye is a new film that I actually enjoyed.  Thumbs up to Wes Craven and the cast!  - Donna Di Giacomo</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Vietnam War Prequel"></head><body><p>This is essentially a Vietnam War prequel. Most Vietnam War movies cover many time periods well after the war started. This is at the very early days of the war.<p>Mel Gibson is very good in this role. I had in my mind the "pretty boy" from some of his other movies and had doubts that he could be a soldier. He pulled it off and did an excellent job. Smart, brave and handsome without the baggage that typically goes with that.<p>Perhaps not as accurate as "Black Hawk Down" nor as emotional as "Saving Private Ryan". Still, much better than 80% of the Vietnam War movies and better than many other war movies, excepting "Black Hawk Down", which may be my favorite. Good stuff.</p></body></html>

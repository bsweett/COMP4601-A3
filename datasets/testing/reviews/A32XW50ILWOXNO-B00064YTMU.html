<meta name="summary" content="LA, after dark"></head><body><p>"Collateral" is one of the best films of 2004, a visually sumptuous masterpiece that may eclipse "Heat" as the definitive modern Los Angeles crime picture. Michael Mann directed both, and, using digital technology here, photographs the city so initimately LA seems almost foreign: Gone is the balmy, commercial gleam of Beemers and cell phones; in its wake, a spare, working metropolis pocked with desert wilderness. It recalls the Raymond Chandler days: Men live and work here. The white noise has been dialed all the way down. The plot to "Collateral," from Stuart Beattie's screenplay, is mere potboiler, but Mann's style so informs the story that it acheives a kind of elegance, a fuzzy sheen not unlike the halos surrounding the street lights in the movie.<br /><br />The same can be said of the comfortable subtle performances from two noted extroverts, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise is Vincent, nihilist first, hitman second, more brutally than silently efficient, who hires cab driver Max (Foxx) to usher him around to six targets throughout the city. The first hit is a failure: Vincent's target falls out the window and onto Max's cab.<br /><br />"Plan B," Vincent says.<br /><br />A conflict emerges: The Foxx character is smart, angry and moral enough to size up his captor's plan - Max might as well be on the ferry going across the river. It becomes a question of impulse, and the cautious, plodding Max is not initially up to it until Vincent rigs a daunting, if unlikely, scenario inside a night club. Other preordained complications - foreseen, frankly, as these movies exist to have curveballs - emerge; Vincent is fond of jazz, and likens the rest of the evening to improvisation, "between the notes."<br /><br />Visually the movie is precisely imperfectly so, as Mann mixes his patented jam-in-your-face close-up with overhead shots, staged medium compositions, documentary snippets, as when a coyote gallops across the street in the dead of night. The epic cool of "Heat" is gone, replaced by blue-collar sweat and that dense grain of Mann's "Ali" - it seemed cinematically ambivalent at the time, but it's making more sense now.<br /><br />The look of "Collateral" is disturbing and beautiful, distancing and timeless. The apex comes when Cruise is framed by a subway window, outside which the sun has begun to rise, the curved palms beginning to get distinguish themselves against the sky. It is a Mann Moment, one that escaped him in "Ali," and was simply too contrived and arch in "Heat" when Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro clutched hands.  Here it is exotic and lush, both contained within the car and infinite out the window, with a view stretching for miles toward the desert or ocean. It is a shot the city, and cinema, deserves.</p></body></html>

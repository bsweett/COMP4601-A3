Harking back to the old shoot 'me up revenge flicks of the 80s, Jonathan Hensleigh's THE PUNISHER has the perfect ingredients for a great action movie: A great story (Something that a worryingly-large amount of movies today lack), no obvious CGI, equally impressive villains and with Thomas Jane, a name to watch out for from now on. The oft-mentioned "5th actor" - the soundtrack suits the dark mood really well, and the stunts, explosions, fight scenes, one-liners, evil eyes, fights to the death- all present and so much fun! John Tarvolta makes a welcome return to form aswell. Despite the incredible ending, the scene I liked the most was the massive punch-up between Castle and the Russian. Absolutely fantastic! I never thought it's say this, but bring on the sequel!</p></body></html>

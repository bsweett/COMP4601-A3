However, I approached it with a wary eye, as it was recommended to me by the same friend who suggested I see "The Usual Suspects."<br /><br />"Memento" is unmomentous for the same reason "The Usual Suspects" was: It requires hanging all one's emotions as a viewer on the gimmick peg. For example, I stopped watching "The Usual Suspects" about 3/4 into the movie.<br /><br />"It was just, frankly, boring," I told my friend. "I lost interest."<br /><br />My friend screamed at me that I missed the big shock ending, in which Kaiser Sose is explained. I would've loved that movie, I was told, if I was simply patient enough to wait for the big payoff at the end.<br /><br />I countered that Hitchcock movies have big shock ending payoffs at the end, too, but that Hitch *kept the viewer interested* with taut suspense, a great plot and finely-honed dialogue.<br /><br />So, I went into "Memento" with a little more patience. I stuck with this one until the bitter end, and it was indeed bitter.<br /><br />The gimmick in this movie, which I picked up a third of the way into the inaction, is that it is shot in reverse time. Its hero, played by Guy Pearce, who must have graduated from the Keir Dullea Space Odyssey 2001 school of cardboard acting, suffers from a memory disorder. He can't remember what happened the day before, so he must reconstruct it physically -- with Polaroid shots and body tatoos -- to create a history for himself, so as not to go totally insane.  He also is tracking down a killer (a device borrowed from Hitch). When he catches the real killer, he can exonerate himself.<br /><br />But, the story is told with painstakingly pedantic scenes and horribly fake understatement. I had no sympathy for the hero at all, and if it weren't for some very good acting by Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano, I probably would have tuned out early.<br /><br />The problem with "Memento" is that it tries to hard to be a film noir for our times, while ignoring just what it was that made those movies so memorable. Combing my mind, I cannot even think of one lesser film noir that was less entertaining than "Memento," and no, I'm not forgetting "Johnny Stool Pidgeon" or "Detour" either. As far as "The Big Sleep," "Out of the Past" or "White Heat," forget about it! "Memento" is so far out of their league that it is an insult to compare this dreck with those great classics.<br /><br />Watching movies requires, as we all know, the "willing suspension of disbelief." And I've got plenty of that suspension: It keeps me well entertained even by such formulaic movies as "Dodgeball" and "Mr. 3000." When it comes to movies, I admit I am guilty to being an escapist.<br /><br />But, when something is just patently ridiculous that it defies belief, that's where I draw the line. In order to reconstruct his identity, Pearce has had tatoos embossed all over his torso. Okay, that's fine. I'll buy that.<br /><br />However, just look at those tatoos: The producers obviously wanted them to look so cool that they went whole hog that they had a tatoo artist not just scrawl utilitarian messages on his body, but recreate the Sistine Chapel according to Marilyn Manson across his chest and arms. This one affectation comes off as more pretentious than the entire final script for "American Beauty."<br /><br />Of course, there are no scenes of Pearce actually getting a tatoo. They would be too laughable.  However, I can imagine what one scene from the cutting room floor might look like:<br /><br />PEARCE: I need this tatooed.<br /><br />TATOO GUY: What does it say?<br /><br />PEARCE: "He has a gun, and he's coming for you."<br /><br />TATOO GUY: That's a lot of words, but if I just use navy blue, I can do it for you pretty cheap.<br /><br />PEARCE: Cheap? I have $1000. Go to town, man.<br /><br />TATOO GUY: Where do you get all that money? I mean, you live in a fleabag hotel, and with no obvious means of support.<br /><br />PEARCE: I got it from Chris Nolan, my director. He said I've got to look "killer cool." Use this CD cover as an example for your fonts.<br /><br />TATOO GUY: Wow, that IS cool. Motorhead's "Sacrifice." Lots of cool Goth script.<br /><br />PEARCE: That's right. We're going after the MTV crowd: Nolan told me not to worry too much that there's nothing really cool about me at all, at least not in the Robert Mitchum or Elvis sense. Nolan said "image is everything," so with these tatoos, and working out at the gym all day, so that my pecs look really ripped, I can't lose.<br /><br />TATOO GUY: Bitchen, dude.<br /><br />Of course, there is a bona-fide shock ending by the time this mess wraps up, but you'll figure out that Pearce is the killer long before he does.<br /><br />If you have the intestinal fortitude to sit through this half-hearted art-school film, I recommend Edward Dmytryk's 1965 classic amnesia thriller "Mirage" as the perfect antidote. A tightly-shot thriller in the Hitchcock tradition, Gregory Peck doesn't need pecs nor tatoos to deliver a convincing performance. Instead, he uses Peter Stone's crafty dialogue. He also does something else that has eluded Guy Pearce.<br /><br />He *acts* .</p></body></html>

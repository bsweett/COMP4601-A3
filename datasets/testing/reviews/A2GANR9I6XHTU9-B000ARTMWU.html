<meta name="summary" content="Interesting addition to the Horror Genre"></head><body><p>High tension is a new and interesting horror film recently released. Ive never seen anything like it before. They dont call it High Tension for nothing, thats for sure. The whole movie will have you on the edge of your seat and there is more than the fair share of shocks and suprises throughout the film. The overall atmosphere has a lonesome creepy feeling about it, full of cornfields, seclusion and quietness. Gorehounds will love this, there is tons of gore and the ending will suprise the hell out of you. There are very few horror films that can shock you in such a way where you literally jump out of your seat but this one has its moments.<br /><br />The setting is France.-The story surrounds Alex and Marie, 2 college students who retreat to Alex's parents isolated farm house looking to study for their college exams for the weekend. While everyone in the house settles in for the night, Marie is in bed when she starts to hear sounds and sees a truck pull up. Soon enough a homicidal maniac breaks in the home and from there its a non-stop rollercoaster ride of terror. And then the twist at the end..<br /><br />This is a movie that shouldnt be missed by fans of the horror genre. It revels in its gore and has a smart edge to it.<br />High Tension is partially dubbed into english but for a lot of the movie you dont need subtitles. Noone says a word and the actions say it all.<br /><br />Unrated version DVD Features-<br />16:9 Widescreen<br />5.1 and 2.0 Dolby Digital<br />U.S Unrated Version<br />DVD Introduction with Alexandre Aja and Gregory Levasseur<br />Haute Horror- Making of High Tension<br />Building Tension<br />Giannetto De Rossi: The Truth, The Madness and The Magic<br />Selected Scenes commentary with Alexandre Aja and Cecile de France<br />Original French language Director's Cut<br />U.S. English language dubbed version<br />Optional English subtitles, Optional Spanish Subtitles and Trailers<br /><br />Overall Highly recomended, try to get the unrated version.</p></body></html>

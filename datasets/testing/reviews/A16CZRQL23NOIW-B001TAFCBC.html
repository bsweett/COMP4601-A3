<meta name="summary" content="The tyranny of memory"></head><body><p>The great Albert Camus stated once: "The disgrace of having a good memory is the nostalgia".<br /><br />Our affective and emotional core has its basis in memory. Nostalgia for example, is perhaps the most poetic region of this faculty.<br /><br />So when you have the chance to erase from the memory a bite of it, in a way equivalent to a lobotomy. We are not better, just different. Charlie Kaufman wrote a postmodern fable in which science fiction is the gateway to imagine the possibility of building our memories, beyond the free will. Hence the nostalgia - for me it is a verb rather than a word - makes both decide, despite the errors, and disconnectedness of everyday disagreements correct the helm and give both a second chance.<br /><br />The script is nearly round, with a secondary reading of a noted physician and his beautiful assistant. That line was not sufficiently dramatically developed and its outcome did not quite measure up. Moreover, the conductor thread would have enabled dramatic confront both sides of the coin: rearrangement and impregnable tragedy.<br /><br />Though it would mean not acknowledging that this was perhaps in the most interesting cult film of that year. It's a film that continues to captivate much of the new generations despite the elapsed years.<br /><br />Jim Carrey has never been better in any film. Kate Winslet absolutely convincing in this role of woman-child, and also kudos for Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst who established a real sexual chemistry with Mark Rufalo.</p></body></html>

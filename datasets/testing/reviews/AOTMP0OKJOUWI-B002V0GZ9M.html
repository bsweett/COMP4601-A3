<meta name="summary" content="Definitely fluffy and sappy... but also a guilty pleasure"></head><body><p>While I do enjoy my chick flicks and romances, I tend to be rather picky about them.  This was the type of movie I should have mocked, with star-crossed lovers spouting poetic descriptions without ever really telling all that much about themselves and the roll-your-eyes plot twists.<br /><br />And yet... there is just something about that ugly glass house on the lake and two people dwelling in it two years apart. I'm sure all hopeless romantics will agree.<br /><br />Reeves and Bullock have great chemistry, even despite their lack of touching in this movie.  I still say that what keeps this movie going is the sheer concept. It's a neat idea, and I guess I appreciate them dwelling on the relationship rather than the mechanics. Indeed, there are a few loose ends and I think they made me like the movie all the more.<br /><br />The film has a rather quiet, rainy day feel to it that adds to the sleepily romantic mood and I found the score quite lovely.<br /><br />To put it simply, if you don't like chick flicks and sappy romances, you will hate this movie. If you're a hopeless romantic that loves the aforementioned, you'll probably enjoy this.  I know I did.</p></body></html>

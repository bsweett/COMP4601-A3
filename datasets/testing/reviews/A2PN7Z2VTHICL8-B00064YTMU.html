<meta name="summary" content="Indifference paves the way to an assassin's accomplishments"></head><body><p>Cab driver Max (expertly played by Jamie Foxx) has been driving a cab for twelve years in Los Angeles, saving up for his dream of creating Island Limousine service.  He picks up a fare, Annie (Jada Pinkett-Smith) who is working late for the Prosecuting Attorney's office, preparing for a big trial the next day.  When Max gives Annie a speedy ride and pleasant conversation, Annie impulsively hands him her business card.<br /><br />Max then picks up his next fare, a man named Vincent, who says he is only in town for the night on real estate business.  Vincent tells Max he needs to stop at five separate addresses for paper-signings, and winds out hiring Max's cab for the entire evening.  But Vincent is not into real estate, he is an assassin.  When his first hit of the evening inadvertently falls out of a fourth story window and onto Max's waiting cab, Vincent confesses to Max his real profession and orders him to drive him to the remaining four hits.<br /><br />When Max asks Vincent what he is, Vincent replies, "I'm Indifferent."  Indifferent is a kind word for Vincent, he is a cold and ruthless sociopath, and expert in his field with a reputation for getting the job done.  Max is in over his head, stunned and shaken by the brutality that has entered his world, and desperate to find a way out of his situation without really knowing how to achieve such a feat against such a monster.<br /><br />Get ready for some truly spectacular performances in this tension filled film.  Vincent is a new type of role for Cruise, that he carries out with amazing believability and casual elegance.  Jamie Foxx outperforms himself as Max, highlighting the superior actor under the hilarious comedian.  Jada Pinkett-Smith's role as Annie was fairly small, but stands out because of her excellent performance.<br /><br />Can Max survive this hellish night?  Will Vincent achieve his merciless mission?  Is there any rhyme or reason to the selection of his victims?  How does Annie tie into Vincent's plans?  Just because the plot to this movie can be summed up in a couple of paragraphs does not mean that it is in any way boring or predictable.  `Collateral' is a tense thriller, with a tight script, great performances, rapid action bursts, and enough mental friction to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />My hat is also off to Michael Mann for his superb directing skills, bringing back memories of Manhunter and Miami Vice as he expertly melds audio to visual, creating that sensory indulgence so unique to Mann's work.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie whether you are in the mood for action, thrills, or tension.  Pick yourself up a copy, it's a buyer.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

The most magical moment for me was the entire scene starting when Lucy steps back into the snow and discovers Narnia to when she awakens and the fawn helps her return to the lamp post.<br /><br />About the only thing that I didn't like was Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan.  It was too recognizable.  Everytime Aslan would talk, it would jolt me right out of the movie to visions of Liam Neeson.  He's a great actor, and I've enjoyed his films, but for me his voice didn't work for Aslan.<br /><br />Edmond is truly easy to hate.  They never redeem him fully.  The battle scene was oddly disjointed from the rest of the story.  Like it didn't fit, or was too Return-of-the-King-ish.  The movie really could have stood on its own with the magic and adventure, it didn't need a battle scene.  What were they trying to make it?  Like Bedknobs & Broomsticks?  Disney, &lt;sigh>.</p></body></html>

It is probably most memorable for Helen Mirren's superb portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II, transforming the icy head of the British royal house of Windsor into a remarkably complex, all too human, individual, dedicated to her outmoded notions of loyalty and duty to both her British subjects and her own dysfunctional royal family. Without question, Mirren has truly made this role into one of the crowning achievements of her superb acting career, and it is an achievement that deserves not only the Academy Award nomination that it has earned, but hopefully, the award itself, along with the awards and other honors she has received already. James Cromwell is almost as impressive too, portraying the dour Prince Phillip,  Duke of Edinburgh (He reacts to the news of Princess Diana's death by taking her young sons on a series of hunting trips on the vast estate of Balmoral Castle, in Scotland, where the royal family is spending the summer of 1997.) and, so is Michael Sheen as the young British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who's been forced unexpectedly to deal with the first major political crisis of his administration, acting adroitly to serve the interests of both the Crown and the realm. Frears does a magnificient job in probing the internal dissent that's rampant in both the Windsor household and the Prime Minister's office in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death and the unexpected public grief expressed by the British public. He skillfully weaves to and fro from the fictional aspects of this docudrama to actual news footage covering Diana's death, public reaction to it, and finally, the public funeral held in London nearly a week after the automobile accident in Paris which claimed the lives of Princess Diana, her lover, and their limousine driver. Much to their credit, director Stephen Frears and writer Paul Morgan have crafted a memorable cinematic tale that treats respectfully both Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Diana, and yet, still manages to yield a truly memorable, quite sympathetic portrayal of the British monarch from Helen Mirren. Even if you're unfamiliar with the United Kingdom's government or its royal family, you'll still find much to be savored from this fascinating portrait of the House of Windsor and Prime Minister Tony Blair. Not only is "The Queen" among the best films of 2006, but it is also among the most memorable I have enjoyed watching in recent memory.</p></body></html>

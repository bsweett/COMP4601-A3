<meta name="summary" content="Not for young children?  Intense, Wonderful Fantasy."></head><body><p>I had to purchase this.  I did not bother renting it, first.  After an interview with the director (on NPR), I was hooked, already.  I study Spanish and History (and many other subjects), so the premise of the film sparked my interest on collegiate levels as well as peaking my Fantasy interests.<br /><br />The author discussed his childhood, Mexico, studies of Spanish history during the Fascist era, then he explained how he infused all of this into the film.  When I purchased the movie, I was not disappointed!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)</a> lives up to the previews, interviews, and expectations created before its release.<br /><br />This film is a Dark fantasy, and I doubt that some children could handle the content but this is a wonderful tale.  The movie is very intense, and deals with Real World issues; death, female subservience, war, poverty, fascism, and a host of negative human emotions and actions.  Simultaneously, the Fantasy aspects of this great film give us a window into Other Worlds, and give the little girl an escape from harsh reality.<br /><br />Though I would not recommend this movie for most children (below the age of 11-13, depending upon their maturity), I certainly recommend this film for everyone else (especially adults).  Few people remember or care about history, therfore history is repeating itself.  This film could be set in the near future, just as easily as it seems to be set in the past.  This film will be eternal: a classic.</p></body></html>

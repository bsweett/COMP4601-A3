<meta name="summary" content="A tribute to Bobby Darin"></head><body><p>I thought this movie was just a delight. I will buy the DVD when it is released and watch it again. I did not give the movie 5 stars because some of the important details about Bobby Darin's life were omitted. For example most acts of the time started in the Pocono's; as he did. I just think it would have added depth. As would his friendship with Dick Clark.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey does all his own singing and dancing in this film. And he does a great job. He has captured the essence of Bobby Darin. His performace is so good in this movie, that I would like to see him in concert. And Kate Bosworth did an admirable job of playing Sandra Dee. This is a great musical and a must see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Thriller That  Delivers"></head><body><p>This well-crafted thriller by director Michael Mann offers not only edge-of-the-seat suspense but also solid characterization and cinematic mood.  Jamie Foxx, in an exceptional performance, plays taxi driver Max who still dreams of starting his own business while trapped in his night job of driving fares around LA.  When he inadvertently picks up hit man Vincent (Tom Cruise), everything comes down to survival as his life depends on Vincent's slaughter of others.  Detective Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) is the only one who sees the connectivity of the murders and who may be Max's only chance of rescue.<br /><br />The surprise of this movie is the acting and chemistry between the two stars, Foxx and Cruise.  Both give their characters depth - and the viewer perversely understands both Vincent's affection for Max and his willingness to kill him.  But Foxx is the man we identify with, not only because his life is in jeopardy, but because of his dreams, his principals, and his mix of fear and astounding bravery.  The viewer is with him every step of the harrowing way.<br /><br />The soundtrack is good, and the mood created by Mann of a late-night, underbelly LA is exceptional.  The movie has a classiness that many thrillers do not.  Its major flaw is the relative predictability of its final scenes.  While Jada Pinkett Smith turns in a fine supporting performance, she stands in for the typical Hollywood gotta-have woman who motivates the male protagonist.  Her role is all too clear early in the film; however, Mann adeptly diverts the viewer by his suspenseful handling of plot and character.<br /><br />Recommended viewing for thriller fans.</p></body></html>

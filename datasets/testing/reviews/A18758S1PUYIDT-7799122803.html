I thought the Tweedles had arrived straight from Nightmare Before Christmas, the twisted tree might have been left over from Sleepy Hollow, and the music sounds like most of the music of Burton's other films.  And of course, there is Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter.  Again.<br /><br />And what was with the blending of the poem "jabberwocky" with the story of Alice?  That just didn't work at all for me.</p></body></html>

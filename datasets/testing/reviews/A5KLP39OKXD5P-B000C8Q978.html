'Broken flowers' is one of those films. You get the initial impression that the charecters you witness on screen, are genuine, realistic and so are the situations. Bill Murray plays the charecter called Don and you are forced to think from Don's point of view, from his eyes. Bill Murray is almost perfect in his role and makes you think what would it be like to be in Don's shoes. Its the story about Don, his present and then certain things that introduce us to some of his old aqcuaintances, takes him and us to a journey to his past. Its truely a beautiful piece of cinema, very genuine and Bill Murray steals the show easily. Watch out for Tilda Swinton, her role is brief but her performence is just beyond words. A silent drama not to be missed at all. I am happy to own the dvd.</p></body></html>

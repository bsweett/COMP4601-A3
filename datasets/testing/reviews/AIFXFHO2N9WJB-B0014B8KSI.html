I don't know any lawyers to speak of, I'm not well-versed in the law, but I enjoy watching movies that are based in or around the legal system. From the various John Grisham adaptations (who also happens to be one of my favorite authors) consisting of "A Time to Kill", "The Client", and "The Pelican Brief" (which was his worst effort on film and on paper) to Aaron Sorkin's "A Few Good Men" to "Primal Fear", I love almost every single one of these types of films to one extent or another. When I noticed that another legal movie, "Michael Clayton", was coming to the big screen, I of course became interested, and when I heard that it was not only being written by acclaimed writer Tony Gilroy (the `Bourne' series of films), but he would also be sitting in the director's chair for the first time, my interest was piqued even further. Now, having Tony direct the film did worry me a little bit that maybe the film wouldn't be up to snuff, but when George Clooney (`Ocean's' trilogy), Tom Wilkinson ("Batman Begins"), and Sydney Pollack ("Changing Lanes") were set to star in the film I figured that he must be doing something right, otherwise I doubt he'd get such an incredible cast of actors assembled for his movie. So, needless to say, when "Michael Clayton" arrived on DVD I was looking forward to my chance to sit down and watch it, and I couldn't have been happier with the results.<br /><br />"Michael Clayton" is an attorney who is known as a fixer; essentially he's the go-to-guy when the firm he works for needs a mess to be cleaned up. Michael (George Clooney) is the best there is at what he does, but when one of his firm's top litigators (Tom Wilkinson) seems to suffer a mental break and rashly decides to switch sides in a $3 billion dollar case after coming across some rather eye-opening evidence, Michael is brought in to try to rectify the situation. However, this may be one mess that his vast skills my not be enough to handle. The harder Michael works to cover up the damage being done to his firm, the closer he comes to discovering the evidence that caused the situation in the first place, evidence that will put his life into jeopardy as some of the people involved in the case would like to keep their secrets buried, and are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure they stay that way.<br /><br />This was one well-written, skillfully directed, and perfectly acted movie that was definitely worth the Academy Award nominations it received, and should have won more than it did. For a first time director this is one excellent way to kick off a career in filmmaking, and being able to direct something he'd written must have made the experience all the better for long-time writer Tony Gilroy. The story was very well-paced, with fast, sharp, legal-filled dialogue, and some decent twists in the story to keep the audience on their toes. It's surprising that for a legal themed movie not one scene, that I can recall, actually took place inside a courtroom, yet the film never lacks excitement or gripping drama, and easily ranks up there as one of my favorite lawyer movies of all time.<br /><br />The cast of actors and actresses assembled in this film were some of the best talents that Hollywood has to offer, and each member brought their A-game to the screen. George Clooney gives one of his best performances as a flawed protagonist who becomes torn between doing what's right for his firm and what's right for his friend played by Tom Wilkinson. Wilkinson who is an excellent actor in his own right, and is generally at home playing villains makes for a very sympathetic victim of sorts, who desperately wants to be on the right side of a case for a change, and his choice may just be more costly than he can bear. The supporting cast led by Tilda Swinton ("Constantine") and critically acclaimed actor/director Sydney Pollack was excellent, though their time spent on the screen was brief, and it would have been nice had they been given more scenes, these two talents made the most of their time and gave very solid performances and created two very engaging characters for the audience to invest in.<br /><br />"Michael Clayton" is a top-notch legal thriller that contains plenty of legal jargon for those movie fans thirsty for that sort of thing, but without ever setting foot inside a courtroom allowing it to stand apart from other legal dramas. Powerful performances, a brilliantly written script, and a sure-handed first time director makes this a must see movie for fans of legal dramas or just a good dramatic movie in general.<br /><br />"Michael Clayton" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

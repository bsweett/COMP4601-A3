<meta name="summary" content="Letting your guard down!"></head><body><p>Will Smith is brilliant in his comedic timing about how even the love expert can be a fool in love. Hitch meets Sarah (who is so scornful of romance she is like a doberman) and all his smooth talk goes awry. It's a typical "meet your match" that plays out in the gossip columns in New York. But when misunderstandings happen it's up to Hitch to let his own guard down to win Sarah back.</p></body></html>

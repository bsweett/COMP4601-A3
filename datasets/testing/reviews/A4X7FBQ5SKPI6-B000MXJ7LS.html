<meta name="summary" content="Was Stone there also?"></head><body><p>Stoney always tries to do movies about his generation.  Well he has a hard time accepting the fact that now his generation is retiring and living the good life.  Instead of moving to florida and buying comfy shoes, he decided to take on the latest american tragedy and make a movie about it.  I turned if off after I noticed several innacuracies, with the most glaring one of him portraying a black man as a white man.  Sure, ok, I know they could not find the humble marine who helped out that day, so what does stoney do???? Stoney casts some guy who is not even the same race as that guy.  I feel sorry for the real guy because he was cast wrong.  Just a glaring error that should have been fixed.  And although the jumpers were done well, it did not show how terrible it really was because people on the ground got hit by these jumpers.  Also want to say that hey, the men responsible should have been shown more as cowardly wooses.  Oh wait that will be in another movie, but by then we will get a PC movement like sum of all fears where they change them into modern day na-zis.  Ridiculous times call for ridiculous movies I guess.  Long live fireman and cops.  Does stoney have a son because is so maybe he can show who the real infidels are in a future movie!!!!</p></body></html>

But "Grizzly Man" doesn't cast Treadwell in the heroic light of a wildlife activist or the tragic pall of someone who met a gruesome death. Director Werner Herzog challenges Timothy Treadwell's world view just as he tries to faithfully present it. Treadwell spent 13 summers in remote Alaskan wilderness closely observing, filming, and attempting to socialize with grizzly bears. He shot 100 hours of footage of the bears and himself in the last 5 years, some of which we see in this film. His ebullient personality made him a popular bear educator with schoolchildren. But Timothy Treadwell's sentimental view of grizzly bears and of himself as their friend and protector was undoubtedly delusional. Herzog, who narrates the film, admires Treadwell's commitment to filmmaking but criticizes his self-serving view of nature.<br /><br />It is unclear what to make of Timothy Treadwell's obsession with Alaska's grizzly bears, and that's what makes "Grizzly Man" so interesting. The film isn't about wildlife conservation, a subject upon which it barely touches. Perhaps it is about self-delusion. Timothy Treadwell's self-appellation "kind warrior", his belief that a strong face could repel an aggressive bear, the idea that those bears paid any attention to him at all would be strictly comical if Treadwell were not an essentially sincere and likable character. He treated the bears not as wild animals or even as equals, but, bizarrely, as pets. He was an alcoholic who transferred his emotional needs to a fanatic defense of grizzly bears. But Treadwell didn't choose to fight for bears in need of protection. He chose to call himself "protector" of  the stable bear population on Kodiak Island.<br /><br />Yet Treadwell did get a lot of enviable film footage of those bears (by breaking the law). He did educate people about them. He had an appealing sense of humor and revealed more of himself on film than most people would dare. A guy on an ego trip? Certainly. Did he get what he asked for? Maybe. In the end a bear probably killed Treadwell simply because it was hungry, not because it was annoyed, which goes to show how completely indifferent the grizzlies were to Treadwell's efforts to live among them. Perhaps we are supposed to see some of Timothy Treadwell's self-delusion in ourselves. It's there in everyone. Treadwell's case is far from being the most destructive I've seen. But Werner Herzog has done a fantastic job of distilling it. And "Grizzly Man" is pretty even-handed in its sensitivity to Treadwell's supporters, detractors, observers, and to Treadwell himself.<br /><br />The DVD (Lion's Gate 2005): "In the Edges: The Grizzly Man Session" (53 min) is a chronicle of the 2-day recording session of "collective improvisation" in December 2004 for the film's score. Included are interviews with some of the musicians, who had never played together before, as well as interviews with Herzog and film editor Joe Bini. There are some interesting moments, but this featurette is way too long. There is also a theatrical trailer (2 ? min). Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.</p></body></html>

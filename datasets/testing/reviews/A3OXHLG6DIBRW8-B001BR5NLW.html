<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable Action Flick - Recommended"></head><body><p>"The Chronicles of Riddick" is a very watchable Sci-Fi action movie that is the last in the Riddick series (following <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RTCP1A">Pitch Black  [Blu-ray</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001O3YA8">Dark Fury - The Chronicles of Riddick (Animated)</a>). While it does have a few characters from the the first two movies, it could almost stand on its own since the back-story really isn't too important to the main plot line.<br /><br />No spoilers from me; Vin Diesel reprises his role as the fugitive Riddick, a very tough, no nonsense survivalist in the truest sense of the word. There are a lot of new elements added the Riddick universe, including a few new races, and issues much grander in scope than the previous movies. While Riddick is a very cold killer who is capable of explosive violence, he also is very loyal to those he considers worthwhile.<br /><br />The special effects are very impressive in places and I really liked the feel of the environments created for the movie, with some of the Necromonger technology being the creepiest I have ever seen. The various fight scenes are all well done and are some of the best in any movie in this genre.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

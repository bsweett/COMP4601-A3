The special effects will certainly please anybody who likes special effects.  Good comedy, witty dialogue, and a gripping story with lots of conflicts makes the movie even more watchable.  At its core, this is also a good drama about an estranged couple trying to get back together.  At times, this drama makes the film a little tedious.  Otherwise, it is great fun, and would reccomend it to anybody who likes action, movies about scientists, and movies about natural disasters.</p></body></html>

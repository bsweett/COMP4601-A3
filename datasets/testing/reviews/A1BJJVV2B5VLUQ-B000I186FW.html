<meta name="summary" content="Hated this movie with a capital "H""></head><body><p>Outside of the TV commercials and movie trailers, I knew nothing about this film. I didn't even know it was taken from a comic book. Okay... color me ignorant. What I did know was that it had a very cool trailer, Natalie Portman starring, and the Wachowski brothers ("The Matrix") were behind it. As for the movie itself - I was disappointed with the main character. "V" fought the old school way with sharp words and long daggers. He wore a mask throughout the whole movie (showing no emotion whatsoever, obviously). He spoke like Shakespeare's evil twin brother... and I grew tired of it quickly. His ideals were that of a tragic vigilanty solely possessed on striking back at government - in an artsy idealistic kind of way. The movie starts with "V" hell bent on life - so unless you know something about the story before entering the theater - you have no idea where this inflamed scorn is coming from. The action sequences (minus the beginning explosions and Big Ben being blown apart at the end) were downright dull and a let down from previous Wachowski films. Is it possible to go into a movie with NO expections and come out with even less? My wife and I frequent the movies... and honestly, "V" is the worst movie I've seen in 2006 (so far). Warning - rent before you purchase.</p></body></html>

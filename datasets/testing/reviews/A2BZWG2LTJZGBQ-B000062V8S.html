The first came out in 1984, the second in 1991, and this third one in 2003.  After the very successful first film, the series exploded with the sequel, a film which was better than the original (very difficult for a sequel to do).  The second movie introduced us to some different special effects, as Arnold was now the good guy, and the new villain was made of &quot;liquid metal&quot;, and could morph himself into anything he touched.<p>Now, in this excellent third chapter, we have a similar situation.  Arnold is again the hero, with a villain who is more advanced than him.  This time it is a woman(Kristanna Loken) who can not only morph into what she touches, she has a right arm which can turn into just about any weapon you want, and she can control machines remotely.  The goal of the second two movies is the same, kill John Conner or those associated with him.  <p>The movie is missing Linda Hamilton, as Sarah Conner, and real life husband James Cameron as director.  Edward Furlong as John Conner in T2 is Nick Stahl.  Furlong is not missed at all.  Stahl does a credible job with John Conner as a late teenager who thinks the work he did in T2 has saved the world.  Wrong.  Claire Danes plays a veterinarian who gets caught up in the madness and who may play an important role later.<p>The absolute highlight of the movie is an early chase sequence involving all involved.  Danes and Stahl are in a pickup truck, Arnold is on his customary motorcycle, and Loken gives chase in a huge crane and destroys half the city.  At one point she drops the crane and wipes out an entire side of a road.  There's so much carnage it's funny.<p>This brings us to the conclusion, which I will not reveal.  I will say that while some sequels leave open the possibility for another installment, this one all but demands it.  The ending is logical and unlike most Hollywood productions, not happy.  It is subdued, but appropriate and I congratulate the filmmakers for this conclusion.  In short I am looking forward to the fourth film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Who would think a trip to White Castle would be this funny"></head><body><p>This movie is about 2 friends who get stoned and get the munchies. So they see a commercial for White Castle and decide they have to have 20 or so burgars each. It turns into a big long adventure though as one thing goes wrong after another. They pick up a hitchhikeer played by Neil Patrick Harris "Doogie Houser, Starship Troopers" who plays Neil Patrick Harris. He's crazy and horny and steals their car so he could go find some women.<br /><br />  Also along the way they meet a bunch of  other crazy weirdos. There's 2 other people you might recognize besides Neil Patrick Harris. Jamie Kennedy (Scream, Son of the Mask) plays a guy who chooses the same bushes to pee behind as Kumar. Also Ryan Reynolds (Blade 3) plays a doctor who hits on Kumar.  The movie is often crude, disgusting with many weed jokes, but it actually doesn't suck. It's pretty funny and not as lame  as you would think a movie would be that's about a trip to White Castle. The director of Dude Where's my Car doesn't mind doing something silly and unusual and he's good at it. This movie I think is much better than Dude Where's My Car though. It actually makes me look forward to his next movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not for everyone but strong film."></head><body><p>Amazon summary does not do this film justice. Perhaps viewed today, one could say, so-what, but remember this was released in 1972 and is chilling in its forcast of things to come. Icy, precise, acting. Tight dialogue. Violent. Any serious film student or other must see this film. Not a date movie. Not probably one to share with wife either. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</p></body></html>

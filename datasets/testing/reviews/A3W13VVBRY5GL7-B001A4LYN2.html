<meta name="summary" content="Carringtons and Ewings and Plainviews, oh my!"></head><body><p>This is an elegant, beautifully-filmed, brilliantly-scored and intensely acted cinematic experience... ...that left me completely nonplussed and apathetic by the time it finished.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis is really the only actor in this who's either A: on-screen for enough of the movie to make an impact, and/or B: talented enough to make a great performance out of a straightforward set of dialogue. It's not that his supporting cast isn't very, very good - it is - but this film, intentionally or no, ends up as a huge Star Vehicle for Day-Lewis' finely honed thesp skills, and he is excellent as a kind of Charles Foster Kane-meets-J.R. Ewing. Actually, the megalomaniacal leanings of Daniel Plainview are so total and so well-crafted that it's astonishing that we might feel any sympathy for him at all: but thanks to Day-Lewis' skill in the role, he doesn't wind up as a boring bad guy.<br /><br />For which the audience should be very, very grateful: Daniel Plainview is in probably 90% of this film's frames. Although sometimes this does get a little... ...well, more on that later.<br /><br />The direction is superlative and the cinematography, exquisite: Paul Thomas Anderson and director of photography Robert Elswitt have done a wonderful job of visualising the maddening disquiet of Plainview's greed against a barren, unforgiving environment.<br /><br />And the music and sound direction are wonderful, too - this movie uses silence as a sound to great effect for the first thirty minutes or so, and the discord created between lush orchestral movements and harsh, hard-to-hear air raid sirens further the audience's connection with the unusual, unpleasant actions and circumstances of the Plainview family.<br /><br />So why only three stars? For me, "There Will Be Blood" was like eating an entire table full of chocolate cakes in one sitting: sure, they're gorgeous and appealing and made to tempt the consumer - but a whole table full is just too rich and you wind up sick and bored. The relentless intensity of "There Will Be Blood" doesn't allow the audience to catch its breath at all, and while the acting and production are all excellent, the monotony of the film's intense tone doesn't let us assimilate what we've seen. We're constantly assaulted with more Very Serious Acting, more Very Meaningful Imagery, more Terribly Important Cinema - and "There Will Be Blood", at a hefty running time of 158 minutes, asks too much of its audience in trying to stay engaged with all this high-octane one-note relentless Cinematic Wonderfulness.<br /><br />That said, it's still a powerful, brilliant bit of cinema: I just didn't care to see more of it after the one hundred minute mark. Somehow, for me, it's less than the sum of its parts - even if its parts are incredible.</p></body></html>

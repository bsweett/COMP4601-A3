I have always believed the primary component of any lasting film is a great story.  As a child I was as mesmerized by this film as much as I was with "Star Wars."  The script is both highly intelligent and highly entertaining, with much more humor and believable horror than one would expect from a 1956 film.  The direction is polished and inventive, with arcing tracking shots and clever editing techniques strewn throughout the picture.  The acting here is very good, with a defining performance from Walter Pidgeon as Doctor Morbius, and a surprising dramatic turn from later-day comic actor Leslie Nielsen.  The supporting cast all shine, each one containing more depth of character than is normally given to secondary roles.  There is a tidy ending where a chain-reaction is started by merely turning a disc then throwing a switch, with irreversible effects.  A Master Race of beings create a machine 20-miles-squared that can be destroyed that easily?  Not likely.  Regardless, this is still one of the best Sci-fi films from the 1950s.  Thank you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Haunted House Story You Have Heard Before: Fast-Paced and Reasonable"></head><body><p>What you see in `The Amityville Horror' is not suspense; it is a chain of shocks. One good thing about the remake of the hit film `The Amityville Horror' (which spawned countless sequels, one being 3D with then unknown Meg Ryan) is that it is never boring. While you are well aware that the film lacks originality, something always happens every five minutes, accompanied with loud soundtrack and occasional scares. Another is that the film (90 minutes) is much shorter than the 1979 original by more than 20 minutes. Surely the hectic pace of the story is what you can expect from the co-producer Michael Bay.<br /><br />[HOUSES DON'T KILL PEOPLE] This eternally popular `haunted house' theme needs no explanation. The Lutz Family buys an old house which is suspiciously cheap. And it turns out that another family is killed by one demented brother only one year ago. And in a month George and Kathy Lutz realize that they made a big mistake.<br /><br />What a big mistake. They didn't give much thought about purchasing a house in which horrible murders were committed. But George (Ryan Reynolds) goes, `Houses don't kill people; people kill people.' These words sound very familiar, but never mind. The point is, Kathy (Melissa George) soon finds out that her lovely daughter Chelsea starts to act strangely, talking to an imaginary friend. Add to that, Chelsea's baby-sitter is mentally shocked and is sent to hospital after unwisely staying where she shouldn't (as these people always do).<br /><br />These set-pieces keep coming to us like avalanche of horrors. At first it is pretty scary, but as the film goes on, probably most of the audiences would be able to anticipate the timing of the next shock. I don't say the film is scare-less, but these scares gradually get easier and cheaper. The brief explanations about the site of the house belong to the gory scenes of `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Philip Baker Hall (as a cameo) plays a priest, but his experience in the house is already known to those who have seen the original. The difference is that the remake does it with much bigger and louder effects.<br /><br />`The Amityville Horror' is not awful as some critics imply. The performances of the actors, especially those of the child actors are very good, and because of the slick pace of the film it gets seldom dull and boring. But at the same time, you must be thinking to yourself about the following two questions: `Why did they buy the house?" and "Why don't they run away from the house?" You are right, but stop thinking about them and only then you find it moderately entertaining.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Riveting!"></head><body><p>Brilliantly written, wonderfully acted, and superbly directed action film that is believable in many aspects.  One wonders if the terrorists' actions are over-the-top, but for $640 million...?  I think it's definitely in-line!<p>Alan Rickman plays his villainy wonderfully off of Willis' sardonic bravado.  Our business weasel who tries to &quot;negotitate&quot; his way out is also superb.  <p>It's a rollercoaster ride with enough humor thrown in by our idiot Police Chief to keep it entertaining.  I remember seeing it when it first came out and it had me gripping the edge of my seat.  &quot;There are rules for policemen...,&quot; yet our hero does what is necessary to get the job done.<p>Bravo!  Unfortunately, it's followed by a mirror-opposite sequel that makes me want to cry (see my review there).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This kiss will leave you with a bang..."></head><body><p>Thanks to a recommendation from fellow Ammy-friend, Jeffrey Miller, I decided to go ahead and check out `Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'.  I didn't know anything about this movie except that Downey Jr. was in it, Val Kilmer likes men and Michelle Monaghan was the love interest (and I'm totally interested in being in love with her) and so I was taken by surprise as the mock-noir vibe of the film set in, complete with sketchy narration and one preposterous premise after another.  Directed by a screenwriter, the film has a clever way of poking fun at the things we all tend to hate about movies.<br /><br />Clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />The film starts at an industry party (well, it starts with a children's magician act) where we meet Harry who is there with Perry where he meets Harmony.  Harry is a thief who, in an attempt to escape from the cops, stumbles into an audition for a movie and lands the role where he is paired up with private detective Perry who plays consultant for movies.  Accompanying Perry on a stakeout he happens to witness the dumping of a body that somehow happens to coincide with the suicide of Harmony's sister, instantly calling to mind a story straight out of a crime novel that happens to have ties to a very influential (and controversial) man.<br /><br />I have a few issues with the film, most of which come from the construction.  I love the way they go full force into attacking the genre and trying to pull it apart and reconstruct it, but in the process I feel like confusion is born.  Some of the plot points, while understandably unbelievable, are borderline preposterous, which kind of takes you out of the vibe at times.  I also felt that the relationship between Harmony and Harry was verging on annoying and even obnoxious, and it was a part of the film I was not a fan of.<br /><br />That said, there is also a LOT that I really liked about this movie.<br /><br />The acting, for starters, was top notch.  Even though I wasn't a fan of the scripts treatment of Harry and Harmony, both Downey Jr. and Monaghan were fantastic, especially Michelle, who really understood the balance between borderline psychotic and tactlessly seductive.  Downey Jr. had a few spotty moments, but he handled the wit of the script very well, and sold quite a few scenes that could have tanked the film had they not been handled properly (his whole lost finger scenario was pricelessly handled, and that was a part of the film that could have easily been a flaw but he turned it into a highlight).  All said and done though, I was a little disappointed with him because I expected more from an actor who I generally LOVE (his performances in `Tropic Thunder', `Less than Zero' and `Chaplin' are just a few examples of his supreme talent).  For me though, this movie BELONGS to Val Kilmer.  I have never truly been a devoted fan of his, but I have liked his work in the past (and feel that he should have an Oscar for his work in `The Doors'...because I feel he was better than Hopkins in `The Silence of the Lambs'!) and I consider this to be a shining star performance, one I never expected from him.  Not only is he effortlessly hilarious, but he gets the small nuances of his character, and he even convinces you to second guess him with his playful subtleties (and that final scene, with the face slaps, was such a nice tonal shift but so authentic).<br /><br />I totally recommend this one.  It is a modernized film noir that uses the director's knowledge of the writing process to create something that you've never seen before.  Yes, at times I found the narration (and that whole `stop-go' flow of the storyline) to be a tad distracting, but it's a small infraction.  In fact, this is one of those films that I strongly feel will continue to grow on me to the point where, in a few months or maybe a year or two from now, I'll be wishing that I gave this an A grade instead of a B+.<br /><br />Jeffrey, thanks for the recommendation!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Highly enjoyable film"></head><body><p>This movie is actually quite a bit different from the book in several days. Usually, when this happens in a book-to-movie translation, the result is disappointing. However, 'Sahara' was a novel packed with a LOT of scenes, action, and the like, and it would have been impossible to get all of it into the movie.<br /><br />The producer and writers did a decent job of bringing and adapting the book to the screen. You don't have to read the book to like the movie. but I still recommend it because the book is very, very good. It would have been nice if they put in the whole story/plot with the mines (and Malenka), but oh well. The movie has quite a few awesome action scenes that are enjoyable to watch, so two thumbs up from me. And the actors did a nice job with their roles.</p></body></html>

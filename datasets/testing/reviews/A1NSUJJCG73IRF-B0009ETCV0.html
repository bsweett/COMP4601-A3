<meta name="summary" content="Hostage  (2005)"></head><body><p>Director:  Florent Emilio Siri<br /><br />Cast:  Bruce Willis, Kevin Pollack, Jimmy Bennett, Michelle Horn, Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, Marshall Allman, Serena Scott Thomas.<br /><br />Rated R for strong violence, language, and a brief scene of drug use.<br /><br />Running Time:  109 minutes.<br /><br />Bruce Willis dazzled movie-goers world-wide in "Die Hard" with his incredibly likable pizzazz and charm, parading around as a renegade copper with enough wits and muscle for a "Road House" sequel.  That was circa 1988, when Willis was perhaps Hollywood's most dynamic action hero; however, with Florent Emilio Siri's 2005 release entitled "Hostage", viewers are able to see that Bruce almighty may be out of his league.<br /><br />Willis stars as former Los Angeles hostage negotiator Jeff Talley, who has now moved to become the police chief of the small, quiet town of Bristo Camino Failing to save his last victims, Talley is haunted by his letdown as a negotiator and swears to never get wrapped up in that kind of police work again.  Talley's fears are put to the test when a group of rugged bandits (headed by Jonathan Tucker as Dennis Kelly in a fine performance) take a wealthy family hostage inside of their luxurious home.  What the criminals do not know is that the father, Walter Smith (Kevin Pollack), is a mischievous accountant who has illegitimate information to report to a big-time kingpin.  In order to ensure that he receives his numbers, the kingpin takes Talley's family hostage until the police chief conjures up a way to acquire the important data files from the Smith home.  As Talley attempts to talk his way into saving his own family, he must figure out how to wheel-and-deal with Dennis, his brother (Marshall Allman), and a sociopath named Mars (Ben Foster) and direct the Smith children (Jimmy Bennett and Michelle Horn) to safety.<br /><br />"Hostage" is an admirable attempt as an exciting, emotional action film.  Willis thrives in this "every man" kind of role; however, director Florent Emilio Siri puts little focus on the Talley family and allots too much screen time to Willis's "woe is me" routine.  Willis is only fair as the inner-anguished negotiator-turned-chief and Pollack's role is a waste.  The real winners of the film are the younger actors and actresses, providing some solid support to the aging star.  "Hostage" is stimulating and moderately suspenseful (and moderately predictable), but Willis is not hanging from rafters, shooting the bad guys while running barefoot over glass, or jumping off moving airplanes.  If you're looking for the Willis of old, "Hostage" may be a disappointment; but the film does manage to paint a fairly believable portrait of the horrors that circle around a hostage-and those who are directly involved in suppressing them.</p></body></html>

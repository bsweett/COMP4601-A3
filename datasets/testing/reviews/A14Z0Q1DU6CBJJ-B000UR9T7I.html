<meta name="summary" content="Why I HATED Spiderman 3"></head><body><p>Bottom line... heck, even my kids are bored by the thing.<br /><br />To fully understand why SPIDERMAN 3 was a tremendous disappointment, I had to break it down like this. I went along the timeline of the film and wrote down the times that storylines popped in and how much of each there was... Here is what I found:<br /><br />In a 2:19:00 movie. The venom storyline, apart from the slambang finale that was actually really good, consisted of a :38 scene, an :08 scene, a 2:15 scene, a 3:50 scene, a 2:55 scene and a :42 scene, adding up to 10:28. 10:28? To boot, the venom storyline doesn't take off until the 1:03:40 point of the movie.<br /><br />The Sandman storyline consists of 15:32 of film time. Dramatic scenes and everything.<br /><br />There was 25:57 worth of action scenes, including Goblin, Venom & Sandman... other than the finale, which was slightly less than 22 minutes.<br /><br />1:10:40 of the film was reserved for the romance storyline and other random dramas, like friendship and photography. Peter wanting to ask Mary Jane to marry him. Them going out to dinner. Peter making a jerk of himself at a club she's singing at. Peter telling his Aunt that he's gonna ask her. Peter dancing around like something out of Saturday Night Fever. Rehashing the old storyline of how his Uncle died. Harry Osborn and Mary Jane cooking omelets and dancing around. Mary Jane being replaced from her Broadway show.<br /><br />The 1:10:40 doesn't even include the dramatic scenes that involve Sandman and his plight to save his daughter.<br /><br />Ultimately, the movie has a terrible, no, 'terrible' is too generous, DEPLORABLE flow. Personally, I wanted to see more venom. Yet, I got a little more than 10 minutes of venom in 1:57:00 of movie time and had to wait until the 1:03:40 point for him to materialize. Action scenes were few and far between. Two minute action scenes were broken up by long scenes of emotional baggage.<br /><br />I want so badly to give this movie more than 2 stars. The action scenes, when they happen are really really good. Yet, for the life of me, I can't understand why the creators of this film skimped so much on action. They've made TONS and TONS of money with this trilogy. You'd think that they'd try and reward the viewers who have made them FILTHY RICH... yet, it seemed as though they were filming on a budget...<br /><br />So, bottom line... if you don't mind SPIDERMAN 3... the soap opera, you'll love this movie. If you wanted to see Venom, and lots of him, you'll be tremendously disappointed. Ultimately, there were too many storylines, and you'd think that these filmmakers would have learned a lesson from the original Batman movies. Apparently... they didn't.</p></body></html>

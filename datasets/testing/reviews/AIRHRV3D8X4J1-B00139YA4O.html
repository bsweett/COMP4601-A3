<meta name="summary" content="LOST is a refreshing new show that stands out from the reality crap TV!"></head><body><p>LOST The Complete First Season is one of the best TV shows (along with Desperate Housewives) to come out in a long time. In a world where silly reality TV seems to have taken over, it is refreshing to see a quality show out there like LOST. I had never seen an episode of Lost until I watched the entire DVD set. I was afraid to give it a chance when it was on TV, but after seeing mostly positive reviews from people here on amazon I figured I would give the show a chance. All I can say is I am glad I did. Lost is one of the few shows that hooks you in, gets you addicted, and takes you on this emotional journey with the characters. I give Disney a lot of credit for releasing such a beautiful DVD set. They really put much time and effort in to the LOST DVD set and it shows. The set is a digipak which slides out of the plastic sleeve from the bottom, and opens to hold the 7 discs. Three of the digipak panels contain 2 overlapping (think Lois & Clark: the New Adventures of Superman) discs, and the 7th disc stands alone. People may complain about the overlapping discs, but the packaging looks great and is a space saver on the shelf. I was very pleased with the amazing piture quality and the amazing sound. LOST is presented in its original anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1) presentation. The sound is in 5.1 Dolby Digital and makes you believe you're there in the middle of the action.<br /><br />DISC 1 (2:48:39)<br />Pilot - Part 1 (42:13)<br />Pilot - Part 2 (40:17)<br />Tabula Rasa (43:27)<br />Walkabout (42:42)<br /><br />DISC 2 (2:51:38)<br />White Rabbit (42:30)<br />House of the Rising Sun (42:44)<br />The Moth (43:14)<br />Confidence Man (43:10)<br /><br />DISC 3 (2:51:13)<br />Solitary (43:08)<br />Raised By Another (42:45)<br />All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues (42:08)<br />Whatever the Case May Be (43:12)<br /><br />DISC 4 (2:51:24)<br />Hearts and Minds (43:17)<br />Special (43:15)<br />Homecoming (41:36)<br />Outlaws (43:16)<br /><br />DISC 5 (2:52:01)<br />In Translation (43:02)<br />Numbers (43:06)<br />Deus Ex Machina (42:39)<br />Do No Harm (43:14)<br /><br />DISC 6 (3:34:43)<br />The Greater Good (43:15)<br />Born to Run (43:14)<br />Exodus, Part 1 (43:16)<br />Exodus, Part 2 (1:24:58)<br /><br />DISC 7<br /><br />Contains the bonus material.<br /><br />EXTRAS<br /><br />Commentary Tracks<br />Pilot Parts 1 & 2, Walkabout, The Moth,  Hearts and Minds<br /><br />The Genesis of Lost (8:40)<br /><br />Designing a Disaster (7:59)<br /><br />Before They Were Lost (22:55)<br /><br />Audition Tapes (23:34)<br /><br />Welcome to Oahu: The Making of the Pilot (33:20)<br /><br />The Art of Matthew Fox (6:07)<br /><br />Lost at Comicon (1:50)<br /><br />Lost: On Location (43:42)<br /><br />On Set With Jimmy Kemmel (7:15)<br /><br />Backstage with Driveshaft (6:40)<br /><br />The Lost Flashbacks (4:35)<br /><br />Deleted Scenes (14:41)<br />There are 13 deleted scenes from the first season.<br /><br />Bloopers from the Set (4:17)<br /><br />Live from the Museum of Television & Radio (10:56)<br /><br />Scriptscanner<br /><br />Sneak Peeks (14:22)<br /><br />Easter Eggs (1:58)<br /><br />I encourage anyone who appreciates quality TV to check out this awesome LOST Season 1 DVD set!</p></body></html>

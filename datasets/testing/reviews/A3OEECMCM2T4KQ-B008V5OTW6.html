<meta name="summary" content="Haunting Realism"></head><body><p>Realism at its most haunting, Munich is a multi-layered film addressing many issues. Although revenge is its central theme, an eye for an eye, the story is about nationalism, loyalty, the value of family and that thin line between killing in war and plain murder outside the so-called war arena.<br /><br />The film begins in Munich during the Olympic games. As is well known to those who were living at the time, Palestinians stormed the Olympic village and took the Israeli team hostage. As the world watched the tragedy unfold on their television sets, most were hopeful that the outcome would be without bloodshed and death. As a child I remember distinctly staring at the television in a kind of shock, and after the hostages had been murdered, experiencing terrible nightmares for some time. To be sure, I was not alone with these feelings - this was not a movie but real death.<br /><br />The film does an excellent job of representing this tragedy.<br /><br />The scene changes and the Israeli Prime Minister is confronted with a difficult decision. Although bombing Palestinian villages in retaliation, somehow this was not enough, thus she gives the order to assassinate, one by one, the perpetrators directly responsible.<br /><br />The Australian actor, Eric Bana, portrays the young Israeli solider who must disconnect from his home, his family and his government, acting as a rogue killer, however financed by the government. In other words, if he is caught, no country or government will take responsibility - like many undercover operatives one reads about, he is on his own. The reason for the covert operation is that it is illegal, against many international laws. The story moves on and he has a team of unusual characters, all loyal to the Israeli cause, to hunt down those responsible for Munich.<br /><br />The settings are many - Rome, London, France, Athens and New York - all beautifully photographed.<br /><br />What I found most astounding was the realism of the film; the killings felt too real, the fear, trepidation, guilt and sadness of all the characters felt palpable. The film's end is a wonderful piece of acting and writing.<br /><br />Generally not a big fan of Spielberg films, this one was a visceral experience, lasting because of its realism and the important issues it raises. The central issue, the occupied territories, the never-ending murder and mayhem, leaves the viewer, not directly involved in that war, wondering when or if a reconciliation will ever occur.<br /><br />A thinking film and superb in all respects.</p></body></html>

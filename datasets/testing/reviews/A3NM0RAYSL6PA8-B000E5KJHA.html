<meta name="summary" content="Decent enough."></head><body><p>I walked out of Tim Burton's remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory amused, but unsatisfied, and certainly not how I'd expect to feel after eating one of Mr. Wonka's scrumptdiliumptious treats. Sure, there were moments of crunchy goodness, but most of the experience involved the fancy wrapping.<br /><br />Mr. Burton's hit or miss storytelling (he can be terrific, as in Big Fish, or horrific, as in Planet of the Apes), mainly misses here. But that isn't the worst of it.  The biggest failure of the film is Willy Wonka himself. He is a character of little or no substance, inexplicable and odd for the sake of being inexplicable and odd.  As if in a last ditch effort to give the guy some depth, this hackneyed backstory about his father (who, irony of ironies, was a dentist) was spliced in through flashbacks that might be interesting if they weren't so one-dimensional.  Instead, they do little more than interrupt the flow of the story and set up an anti-climactic ending in which Willy resolves his issues with his father by visiting him.<br /><br />I must confess that I really like the original film version of the story. And it is in contrast to that gem of a film that the weaknesses of Burton's version stand out.  The Charlie of the first movie isn't a uni-dimensional angel (selfless, unflappable, never tempted), and his character is defined by a remarkable ending that offers him more temptation than even the best child ought to be able to resist.  The new Charlie, well, is perfect, start to finish.  Where's the challenge (and character development) in that?  Burton eschewed the important story features (the Slugworth bribe offers) that made the trip through the chocolate factory a rolling moral conundrum.  Burton offers no replacement story device to preserve this important subplot (instead, we get the Wonka backstory). One point of dissonance, though, is the scene in which Charlie finds a ten dollar bill in the snow and, without a second thought, uses it to buy candy. With the set up that Charlie is completely selfless, and that even a thin dime might help his starving, destitute family, his decision to keep and use the money was jarring. What lesson are we to take away from this?  Finders keepers?  (In the original film, Charlie finds a coin in a gutter ... a coin is one thing; a ten dollar bill quite another. Inflation isn't the answer. If Burton had thought about it, he might have had Charlie give the money to the candy store owner to await a claim by the real owner, and perhaps been given a candy bar as a reward.)<br /><br />Wilder's performance was one of depth and substance. Even without a backstory, you come away knowing exactly who Willy Wonka is: an extremely smart, wise, and artistic man who is on a mission to find a truly good kid.  Not a perfect one, mind you (Charlie, after all, stole the Fizzy Lifting Drinks, another episode that doesn't make it to Burton's film), but one of solid, core decency.  Wilder's character's sly comments, his fluency in multiple languages, and his knowing disdain for the creeps who've found his tickets present the picture of a person who ought to be telling us a story of right and wrong, of good kids and bad.  (Burton doesn't even have the sense to realize that it is better that we not know the fate of Charlie's competitors, leaving us to wonder whether they made it or not, and not really caring.  Instead, he leads them out of the factory like a parade of CGI.  Did we need that?  Of course not.)<br /><br />Depp's Wonka doesn't even come close to Wilder's.  He's an empty, Michael Jacksonesque misanthrope without a clue.  He doesn't seem particularly interested in Charlie, or even to recognize what makes Charlie special. They just seem to end up together because everyone else gets taken away. Even at that point, there is no meaningful interaction between them.<br /><br />There were moments of charm and humor in Willy Wonka; a twisted sense of humor infects some good scenes.  But the story is weak, and Willy himself is weaker.  Add to that genuinely uninspired and forgettable songs and dialogue that attempts to "explain" too much, and you have another remake than ought to have stayed unmade.</p></body></html>

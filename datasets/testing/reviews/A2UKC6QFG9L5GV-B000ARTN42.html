<meta name="summary" content="MOVIE ABOUT A REAL MAN"></head><body><p>I understood recently why movies about boxing get so popular. Because boxing is very similar to life and in such a story you can tell everything: about rises and falls, about joy and grief, about overcoming pain and dificulties, about personal courage and spirit. Boxing is a perfect metaphor for life. I think "Cinderella Man" is the third great boxing film in history along with "Raging Bull" and "Million Dollar Baby". It tells the real life story of James Braddock, a man of boundless bravery and big heart, who once rose from ashes like phoenix and proved to everyone and what's more importand - to himself, that everything's possible if you really want it.<br /><br />This is a truly rigorous and at the same time very sensitive story about life full of disappointment, hard times, devotion, overcoming and, finally, victories.<br /><br />Russel Crowe did an amazing job here, to my opinion this is his best part to date. A really wonderful movie for everybody, even for women who don't like boxing flicks mostly. I also had a prejudice about "Cinderella Man" thinking it'd be another dull boxing movie. But that was only before I actually watched it.</p></body></html>

Mr. Incredible is Batman without the dark side, Elastagirl is, interestingly enough, Mr. Fantastic from the Fantastic Four (a movie coming to our theaters in 2005). The older son is obviously the Flash, and the teenage girl is an amalgam of several characters, both comic and non-comic. But archetype does not mean stereotype. These characters are all freshly represented.<br /><br />For example, instead of having a dark side like his inspiration, Batman, Mr. Incredible has a self-doubting side. And he marries a superhero, creating a family. Another (mostly) unique representation.<br /><br />It would be easy to disect this film into even smaller parts, draw more parallels, but I think that would be doing the film a disservice. Sure, it had inspiration from other comics, but the way it was written, drawn, directed, voiced - everything - made it wholly its own. This is a movie that everyone will love (and the box office is evidencing that), from kids to adults.</p></body></html>

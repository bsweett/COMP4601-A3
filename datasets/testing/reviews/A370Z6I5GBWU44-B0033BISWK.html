<meta name="summary" content="Good movie with few flaws"></head><body><p>Overall, this has been a great movie with an original and unique concept. The plot of the movie has been hashed over in the reviews, so you can read them. Lief Shepphard's review (at this time, at the top of the helpful reviews list and displayed visibly on District 9's page) is a very helpful review, so I will try to not repeat stuff that people already know.<br /><br />What I liked was the starkness of the surroundings - it felt realistic given the location. I can't help but wonder what would have happened if the spaceship stalled above the USA or Europe rather than Africa. The interplay between humans and aliens are also reasonable, with humans profiting off the aliens and offering them services (prostitution, for example) while the aliens try to survive amidst the slums they have been forced to live in. The main character (human) faces an excellent dilemma, and the reactions of the humans around him are very realistic. Overall this is a very thought-provoking film.<br /><br />What I did NOT like was the lack of a backstory. There's no reason for the spaceship stalling, or what Chris (the alien) meant when he was talking to his child (son?) about home. Of course, I don't need some sort of detailed backstory, but it would have been nice if Chris told Wilkus in even just a few sentences what had happened with the ship over two decades ago, where they came from, etc. The ending also hints at a sequel, so if a sequel is made (District 10?) I hope that the backstory will be more touched upon. Overall a decent and thought-provoking film with some great special effects.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Performances save this film!"></head><body><p>This movie is hard to follow.  No question about that.  Most movies that are adapted from Broadway plays don't fair well on screen unless they're made from the classic playwrights (Tennessee Williams, David Mamet, Eugene O'Neill, etc.).  Many of the negative reviews here on Amazon.com expecting more action are justified.  However, I found the movie to be better than expected.  Mike Nichols is one of Hollywood's finest directors.  And with four of the best actors around, he does very will with the challenging subject matter.  Natalie Portman has become the "Harrison Ford" of the Star Wars genre by breaking out into a great Oscar nominated role.  British TV star Clive Owen also breaks free of his shell with his excellent performance.  Juila Roberts & Jude Law round out this excellent cast.  If you can stay with it for the performances, you'll be amused.</p></body></html>

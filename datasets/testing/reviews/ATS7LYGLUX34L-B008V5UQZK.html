Writer Nia Vardalos stars as a love-starved greek-American girl who meets the man of her dreams (John Corbett)....But he's not Greek, so how to reconcile her plans for the future with her Parent's plans for her?<p>  The cast is great, especially the Windex-spraying Dad, and the Movie is a winner from start to finish. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Diassapointed film"></head><body><p>Ridley Scott is one of the top directors in the world. That's undeniable , but what happened with this one?<br />The plot is boring , even ridiculous . Nicolas Cage is perfect in his role but the script goes to nowhere . This film seems inspirated for House of games and a moral lesson for fathers. And the film remains in the middle of the road.<br />I couldn't believe this film carried the signature of Ridley Scott.<br />A minor movie for a status director . As you see the marriage can not result in a happy ending.</p></body></html>

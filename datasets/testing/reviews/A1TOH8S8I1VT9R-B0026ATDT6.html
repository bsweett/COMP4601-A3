The title is simply my very quick assessment of "The Host".  If you've already seen this film, you probably were nodding your head when you read my title (with a little luck, you giggled or snickered).  If you have not viewed this film before then you probably thought I was trying to be sublime.  Sorry about that.  I suppose the polite thing to do would be to explain;<br /><br />-COOL MONSTER<br />The monster is very interesting and well executed.  It is seamlessly integrated into the live action and very convincing visually.  Unlike many monster films, "The Host" does not have a monster theme song or warning; it usually appears when things are quiet.  In fact, the director did a good job of "zoning-out" the viewer when the monster appears.  Like in real life, when in a state of astonished shock, time slows down and everything gets numbingly quiet until we zone-in again.  On the downside, I thought that an aquatic mutation would not be quite as intelligent as this beast and it was just a little too indestructible for most of the film.  However, the overall execution was very effective.<br /><br />-SILLY PEOPLE.<br />First of all, let me state that I am an American.  I've never been to Korea nor am I an expert on Korean culture (I know very little).  So I can't really judge how typical these characters were.  That said, most of them were just a little overblown and hammy.  There was no attempt at camp, its all played pretty straight so this was a problem.  Good performances to lookout for are the little school girl whom I enjoyed quite a bit, and her Grandfather who at least seamed genuine.  Most of the other main subjects were sort of caricatures rather than characters.  The American characters were scripted and acted just horribly and the obvious villains (even more so than the monster who is played as more of a consequence of the evil Americans than an evil unto itself).  There is one American hero type but he's not very effective.  I must admit enjoying the family dynamics of the featured characters even if I didn't like them and despite a little too much of them.<br /><br />-BRIDGES AND TRAILERS<br />Again, I know nothing of life around Seoul, Korea.  I have to assume there are lots of bridges and trailers based on this film.  It was definitely an interesting backdrop for a monster movie; particularly the bridges.  The bridges were used mostly as artistic graphic elements; employing triangulation, perspective and geometry to create visually stunning imagery.  I have to give credit for top notch cinematography in this film.  It was a visual treat and actually above the story and characters deployed.  The trailers were effective in that they provided very little sense of security, being what they are.  The bridges get 5 starts, the trailers 3.<br /><br />THE DVD<br />-I bought the 2 disc set.  I have yet to watch disc 2.  However, disc one had quite a few extras itself including a bunch of deleted scenes.  The picture and sound were good So this is a pretty good value.<br /><br />-ADD IT ALL UP...<br />... and you have a strange mix of brilliant visual FX, beautiful cinematography, uneven acting and a slightly bloated story.  The idea of formaldehyde mutating aquatic life to such a degree is something you will need to overlook to enjoy this film(I did immediately) .  You also better be ready to see Americans stereotyped as despicable opportunists without a thought for the consequences of their actions.  I thought it was more comical than offensive.  I never found this film too scary or gory; it's more of a drama. It has some seriously slow spots and somewhat unnecessary character development and a rather heavy handed political statement (I think it was the Directors attempt at being sublime). I found the monster scenes to be enthralling and entertaining and the overall visuals worthy of a better script.  I thought it was ok.  I definitely recommend "The Host" as a rental at least.</p></body></html>

Bruce Willis is a cop who takes charge of the hostage situation.  But Pollack has something in the house that both the mob and the FBI want, the latter interfering with Willis's control of the situation.  However, the boy, locked in his room, finds a cell phone and becomes Willis's informer from inside the house.  The boy's involvement is reminiscent of Home Alone, even more of Playing Dangerous.  It's a pretty standard hostage suspense situation, but very well done with some surprises.</p></body></html>

There isn't a bad performance in this movie, the blood and gore is over the top, and you will lose count of the hysterical one-liners throughout. One minute you're busting out laughing, the next you're watching a zombie rip someone's intestines out.<br /><br />What I love about this movie is how honest it is. It doesn't try to be something it's not; it's not deep, philosophical, or thought provoking. There is no hidden message or hidden agenda, it's just pure balls to the walls blood, gore, action, suspense, and plenty of laughs. Even though there isn't much of a plot to speak of, and even though there is hardly any character development, you actually care about these characters and their well-being. The reason you care about them is because they are so unique, quirky, and interesting. These aren't cardboard cutout, throw-away characters who you won't remember the minute after they're killed. No dopey teenagers in this movie, except for the Mexican twin sisters who coincidental were the only characters I could have done without.<br /><br />This film is definitely a modern day grindhouse film, and manages to capture the feel of 70's/early 80's grindhouse movies, right down to the grainy film and occasional missing real. I love it!<br /><br />You can tell everyone involved with the movie had a great time making it, and that completely comes through in the performances. It's just a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously and doesn't require the viewer take it seriously either. I have a feeling Gen X'rs will appreciate this film far more than Gen Y's as many of us remember the real grindhouse movies of our youth. It's like a trip down memory lane if you were into those kinds of films when you were younger (which I was!). The humor will probably go right over the heads of tweens, but if you're a fan of grindhouse, horror, and humor you simply have to get this movie.</p></body></html>

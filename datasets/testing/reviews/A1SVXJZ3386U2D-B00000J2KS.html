I remember my uncle asking me about "A Clockwork Orange" and suggesting that it must be a visual treat.  I realized then that many people may have been expecting the wrong thing when ACO was released.  Nonetheless it IS a visual treat but not in the sense that "2001: A Space Oddessy" was.<br /><br />ACO tells the story of a youthful thug named Alex in a not-so-distant future.  The society he lives in has morphed into one of wealth and poverty and plagued by roving gangs of which our anti-hero is one such member.  We are given a series of scenes that underscore his violent brutality.  We are also given a scene or two that tells us this kid isn't beyond hope.  Well, hope, in the eyes of society, rests with a new treatment that recently arrested Alex is going to be the guinea pig for.  The treatment is a paradox in that it turns Alex away from all violence including acting in his own self-defense.  In solving society's problem the fate of the indidual is discounted.<br /><br />"A Clockwork Orange" does a brilliant job in bringing to life an uncomfortable image of tommorrow and letting us exam an individual such as Alex.  We are filled with anger and disgust with his character but we eventually find ourselves becoming sympathetic.  Alex is excellently protrayed by Malcolm McDowell who has had some excellent roles and some not-so-excellent roles in the past (see "Caligula" or, better yet, DON'T see "Caligula").  His talent is certainly in focus in ACO.<br /><br />One of the interesting aspects of ACO is the music.  I had the soundtrack for awhile until it mysteriously disappeared.  The classical music was terrific, focussing on Beethoven.  I became enchanted with a little ditty called "I Want to Marry a Lighthouse Keeper" which was NOT a work By Beethoven.  This may have been at least one solid connection between ACO and "2001: A Space Oddessy" for those looking for one.  Kubrick knows how to make the most out of a musical score.<br /><br />Some years after seeing ACO for the 4th or 5th time, I came across a copy of the book by Anthony Burgess.  After reading it, I saw the movie again.  For some reason I was a bit disappointed with the movie this time.  I can't figure that out because it is one outstanding movie.  Maybe it was because the book was better?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Your garden variety romantic comedy"></head><body><p>Matthew McConaughey plays Tripp, a commitment-phobic bachelor who still lives at home with his parents and has no plans to change that situation.  His parents, played by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw, are at their wits end when some of their friends tell them about more or less the female Hitch, who is guaranteed to have their son moved out of their house.  Enter SJP as Paula, a relationship consultant who specializes in guys who live with their parents.  She begins dating Tripp as a means to an end, but falls in love with him along the way. Of course.<br /><br />Failure to Launch is more or less just an excuse to have two successful actors star opposite each other in a romantic comedy.  The story arc is hard to follow, the dialogue is average, and the subplots are too dense to make any sense.  I love Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew McConaughey so I was able to look past most of the movie's faults, but it's really just not that good. In fact, it got to be a bit annoying to hear the signature Carrie shriek outside the Sex and the City context and to watch McConaughey play basically the same character from How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Overall, it's your garden variety romantic comedy with nothing stellar to make it stand out.</p></body></html>

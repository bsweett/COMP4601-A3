Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) proves to be a man of great courage and compassion. He unites the warring tribes of Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) and Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). Together they are victorious in reclaiming several important Arab cities.<br /><br />Watching this glorious movie is worthwhile, even if it is on the small TV screen. It is refreshing to see a movie that is made without CGI: The sweeping desert vistas were filmed in real deserts and all the people are real. The unforgettable soundtrack by Maurice Jarre is as good as ever. Peter O'Toole is simple perfect as the conflicted Lawrence and Omar Sharif is also great as his friend, Ali. (Alec Guinness, however, is completely miscast as Arab Prince Feisal.)<br /><br />This true story of an ordinary man who accomplished extraordinary things is beautifully filmed and defines the word, "epic." It won seven Academy Awards in 1962, including Best Picture. Heartily recommended. (This DVD does not have any extras, but the price is right.)</p></body></html>

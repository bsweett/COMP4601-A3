Both of them are rich men who have hit a wall in their lives, and are having trouble with the women in their lives.  I had heard many good things about this movie, and the fact that it was produced by the same people who did Lost in Translation, one of my favorite movies, made me even more excited.  The result, however, wasn't everything that I hoped that it'd be.<br /><br />As I said, Johnston is having trouble with women, in the sense that he can't really hold on to one.  His neighbor and friend Winston (Jeffrey Wright) often notes that Don is like Don Juan, and many people call attention to the fact that his name sounds like Don Johnson.  Don seems to go through girlfriends pretty quickly.  His latest woman, Sherry (Julie Delpy) has just left him, and he finds an annonymous letter from an old flame saying that he fathered a son about 19 years earlier.  At first, he has no interest in what may be a prank, but Winston, who sees himself as a detective-in-training, encourages him to pursue his mystery son, and soon, Don has compiled a list of 5 possible women who may have had his child.  After a few internet searches, Don is on his way.<br /><br />On his journey, he reconnects with a few of his former girlfriends, each of whom are living very different lives in very different places.  The first woman, Laura (Sharon Stone), is a widow living with her young (and possibly nudist) daughter (Alexis Dziena).  Dora (Frances Conroy) is a subdued real estate agent living under the passive aggressive Ron (Christopher McDonald), while Carmen (Jessica Lange) is an animal communicator who may have a certain bond with her receptionist (Chlo? Sevigny).  Penny (Tilda Swinton) lives in the middle of nowhere in the deep south, while the fifth woman is confronted under different circumstances.<br /><br />The events of the search are both humorous (though not laugh-out-loud funny) and sad.  Some of them show regret for leaving Don, while others wish that he'd never shown up in their lives.  Others have problems with their current men.  Unfortunately, most of the events prior to the journey and what happens afterward aren't as interesting.  I will say that at the very end, his talk with a young boy (Mark Webber) seemed to be leading up to a certain ending, only to have something else happen.  While I was definitely expecting a very non-Hollywood ending, what we got was, in my opinion, a little unsatisfying.  I didn't hate it, but there was something missing in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm going to try not to give too much away, but I think that writer/director Jim Jarmusch wanted us to draw our own conclusions about certain things using the themes of the film, such as the color pink, daughters, and sons.  All in all, this film wasn't bad, it's just very different (not that different is a bad thing).</p></body></html>

What I saw were three women who lived desperate, obligatory lives, and who did so with a thinnest of success. One failed entirely, and one loved life - or in her case, "chose life" - by abandoning her world, and, most notably, her children.<br /><br />My original response to this film, a movie depicting the lives of three women who must all face suicide and delve in their own personal masquerades as well as mental illnesses, was that I was somehow swept up in awe of it all. The acting was solid, the cast extraordinary, and the music was sweeping. But then I asked myself, "So what?" I believe the film is guilty of two things.<br /><br />#1. It contradicts its point. Loving life does not equate running from it. I found the women tolerating life at best, and certainly were not adhering to Woolf's famous quote on the nature of living and loving doing so.<br /><br />#2. It takes itself far too seriously. Perhaps this was the impression that Glass' score had on me when mixed with certain scenes. I can't be totally certain. But I do know that the point the film was trying to make is lost in some of the contrived themes in the film.<br /><br />This film is not a total failure. Far from it, in fact. There are moments of delicacy and superb acting that are hard to find these days; however, the point of the film is largely lost by the contradictory philosophies stemming largely from Woolf herself. I also think Glass' music helped overcome many of the otherwise self-important elements. To seperate the music from this film would probably change many minds about its quality.<br /><br />Just my opinion. For those of you who adore this film, you can do what you will with it.</p></body></html>

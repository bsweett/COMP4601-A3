I'm really glad I did. I was wrong. It's not horrible simply because it's old. Sorry for being so close-minded and ignorant. I guess I was under the assumption such an old movie is no longer relevant in todays world, but it actually is.<br /><br />It took a while for the storyline to get to the segments I REALLY had the greatest admiration for, such as when James Stewart's character was forced to learn an important lesson about respecting people (and subsequently taken to a time when nobody even knew who he was because he never existed- you'll understand this segment when you see it) *this* is when the storyline really kicked in for me.<br /><br />It was a lot of fun watching James Stewart's character communicate with people he knew really well around town, however, none of those people knew him at all thanks to an angel taking him to a world where he was never even created.  It was both emotional and exciting wondering what would happen next thanks to James Stewart's reactions and facial expressions.<br /><br />I really liked James Stewart's character too. He really disrespected his family for a while there, but by being shown the way of life, he learned to treat everyone around town with respect and consideration.<br /><br />The entire storyline is really good so I honestly feel really bad for originally skipping over the movie so many times simply because of its age. Don't let age fool you- this my friends, is a holiday classic.</p></body></html>

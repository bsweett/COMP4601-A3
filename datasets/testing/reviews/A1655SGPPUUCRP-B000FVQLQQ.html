Russell Crowe gives his best peformace yet for a Golden Globe winning performance as John Nash, the nobel prize-winning schizophrenic math genius.  Crowe's brutally honest performance sheds some light on the often misunderstood disease.  I walked out of the theater in shock because of Russell Crowe's performance, it was truly touching.  Nash's wife is played flawlessly by a wondrful Jennifer Connelly.  Connelly brings genuine emotion and feeling into this key character.  Connelly's performance also snagged her a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.  Ed Harris is also wondeful is his role.  I won't talk too much about Harris's role for fear of giving something away!  Akiva Goldsman's brilliant Golden Globe-winning screenplay has many of these sorts of surprises, twists and turns.<p>Critically acclaimed director Ron Howard fills 'A Beautiful Mind' with geniune emotion and heart. I found myself personally touched by this film a number of times.  It's pretty shocking how heartwrenching 'A Beautiful Mind' is at times.  I found myself enveloped in tears along with my friends a number of times while watching this film.  If a film can touch you in the way that 'A Beautiful Mind' did for me, you know that it must be a wonderful film.  Fortunately, 'A Beautiful Mind' snagged the Best Drama award at the Golden Globes the other night beating out films such as 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'In The Bedroom'.  I also feel that the original score for this film by the legendary James Horner deserves some recognition.  Read my review of this deeply-stirring Golden Globe nominated score.</p></body></html>

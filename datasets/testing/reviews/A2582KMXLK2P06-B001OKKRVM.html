<meta name="summary" content="It's not easy being a penguin"></head><body><p>WOW!  What a penguin movie.  When that popular penguin craze was taking place across the country a few years ago, March of the Penguins was viewed by many as the ULTIMATE penguin film.  This film does so many incredible things, and does them correctly on ALL counts.<br /><br />Are you an emotional person?  If the answer is yes, you will feel joy, happines, and sadness while watching March of the Penguins, ESPECIALLY if you're an animal person.  Someone who understands and appreciates animals will probably find themselves really attached to the penguins in this movie.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman was the PERFECT choice for narrator.  His very calm and soothing way of speaking is simply in a perfect world of its own, and he proves it here with a tremendous performance.<br /><br />Is it just me, or does it seem like you can REALLY see the male and female penguins communicating with each other?  It's almost like they're talking to each other the same way people do!  It's just they're not speaking using human words, haha.  It's fascinating.  Of course it's also possible my mind is just playing tricks with me.<br /><br />If that's the case, why is it that when the mother penguins return home to their babies, they immediately look down at their babies and appear to smile with joy?  You can clearly sense happiness in their eyes.<br /><br />You can even tell the difference between the males and females just by looking into their eyes.<br /><br />Some amazing creatures penguins are.  You WILL learn things you never knew about penguins just by following along to the story-telling.<br /><br />When the male and female penguins finally reunite after several months and stand close to each other with their baby between them, proving to the other penguins that they're a family... this is definitely a *very* special moment to watch.<br /><br />The storyline mainly focuses on the long and bitter journey that the male and female penguins have to make over the course of a long and severe winter in Antarctica.  BOTH the male and female penguins have quite the task!<br /><br />I complain when it's 30 degrees outside.  These penguins have to deal with temperatures below -60 WITH wind chill on top of that!  Talk about tough winters!<br /><br />You will learn so many things, which brings me to my next point-<br /><br />The camera crew did an ASTOUNDING job showing us up close shots of the penguins, and the way each penguin has to go about their lives just to survive.<br /><br />Thanks to the brilliant camera work, you can easily notice the look on the penguins faces as they communicate with their babies, and when they communicate with their mates.  It's what I believe to be picture-perfect quality camera work.<br /><br />Job well done by EVERONE involved in the making of March of the Penguins.  All the work that was done filming the 100-plus hours of footage has certainly paid off.  None of these incredible shots would have even been possible without the persistent job on the part of the cameramen.<br /><br />Just an incredible movie.  Children will love it for the learning aspect, adults will love it because of the incredible role of parenting the penguins have to carry through every single year (and have done for centuries) and parents will find themselves being able to relate to it (to an extent of course).<br /><br />One thing's for sure, everyone will leave with a new appreciation for how difficult it is being a penguin.<br /><br />The soundtrack that plays is VERY good.  It plays at all the appropriate moments, and it's sometimes melodic, and overall the orchestrated music really captures the feel and gigantic, mysterious beauty that is Antarctica.<br /><br />I also learned some things NOT related to penguins, such as what it's like seeing the sun finally rise in Antarctica after a lengthy period of solid darkness.  The sun actually rises, slowly moves to the left for a short time, then sets again. I was not aware how the sun rises and sets in places like Antarctica and Alaska.  Now I know!<br /><br />Also, about 30 minutes into the film, what the HECK was that?  Green and yellow lights DARTING across the night sky at lightning speed.  I HOPE those lights were actually sped up for the sake of the movie, haha.<br /><br />EXCELLENT film.  March of the Penguins is a perfect movie for everyone.</p></body></html>

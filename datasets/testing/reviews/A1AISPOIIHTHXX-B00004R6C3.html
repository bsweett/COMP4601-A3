<meta name="summary" content="Horror stuck out in the cold"></head><body><p>Despite being excessively popular, I don't have much memories of watching a John Carpenter movie from start to finish, either because I've never watched it (Assault on Precinct 13) or because they were so bad, they quickly left my mind (Escape from L.A., Vampires). But since the Thing is an often-mentioned recommendation when trying to watch a good Carpenter movie, I thought I'd check it out. While it's not necessarily an amazing horror movie, it's a bit effective if a bit familiar and a bit gruesome for gruesome's sake.<br /><br />The film starts off in the Antartic wilderness with a group of men in a helicopter trying to shoot at a running dog. A group of American scientists manage to take down the men and rescue the dog but turns out the dog was not who it appears to be and when investigating the other team's camp reveals a ship in the ice and a body shape in another block of ice which can imitate any form it wants, the team has to figure out who's really who and try and stop the "thing" before it wipes out the whole crew or makes back to the mainland.<br /><br />It's not the most familiar story of course although many films and even TV episodes such as the X-Files "Ice" are described very much as being similar to this film. What makes this film stand out is that there's a real sense of paranoia among the team and people overreacting and wondering who could be not who they are was well played. But then again, the characters don't really have much to do and besides certain actors, I couldn't even remember the character's names or distinguish faces. The film often has things that are unexplained or things that are merely implied so it's sort of a film that you kind of have to be serious in watching yet turn off your brain in sections.<br /><br />Like a lot of horror, you can either go for creepy atmosphere and tension to scare your audience or just think about totally disgusting stuff and call it a day. To that end, the Thing is sort of a combination of the 2 with the latter winning out by a nudge. This is a film with some pretty vile imagery and I'd recommend you don't eat before this one. There are times when it gets memorable such as a dog or something to do with defribillators and a petrie dish but at times they look dated so guess it depends on whether you can blow past it and watch anyway.<br /><br />The highlight of the special features is definately the commentary with Carpenter and star Kurt Russell as its funny and informative, then there's also a documentary covering the film although I never bothered with the production photos as there's looooots of them. But if you're into Carpenter's movies or a fan of horror, check the film out.</p></body></html>

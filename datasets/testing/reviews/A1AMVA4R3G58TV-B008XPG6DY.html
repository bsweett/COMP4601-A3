<meta name="summary" content="Great Acting, Bad Script"></head><body><p>Both Jennifer Aniston and Clive Owen are wonder in Derailed. Aniston plays the bad girl, perfectly. Its great to see her get away from the comedys she does. She has the makings of a good dramatic actress.<br /><br />The script itself was alittle to unbelievable for me. Theres just to many unbelievable things that happen. I can believe a married man would make a few mistakes and get himself in trouble by cheating on his wife. But the more he becomes the victim of the Scam, the more the film becomes unbelievable.<br /><br />There were plenty of plot twists, so the movie kept me interested through out. It just needed more of a touch of reality.</p></body></html>

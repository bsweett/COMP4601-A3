<meta name="summary" content="Comic Book heroes in a Comic Book movie- 'NUFF SAID!"></head><body><p>When you make a movie based on the Fantastic Four comic, this is what you have working against you:<br /><br />-The Fantastic Four is a beloved Comic Book.<br /><br />-The definative superhero group characters created by Stan Lee in the 60's along with his other ultra-icon Marvel heroes are introduced (later followed by the X-Men).<br /><br />-These characters have been archetypes in not only the comic book industry, but in comic book movies, making these heroes seem tired and cliched, before even the movie trailer begins.<br /><br />-Some of the these movies used Marvel concepts so close that concepts accident ran together, most recently the Incredibles: which had a team with strongman, a super-stretcher, an invisible girl with forcefields, and a baby who has flame-power along with multiple other powers. Infact, a scene was cut from the F.F. Movie, with the Thing rescuing a cat from a tree by ripping the tree from the ground and shaking it, because the Incredibles "beat them to the punch!"<br /><br />-No amount of "Re-inventing" without completely losing the original concept can alter the "retro-ness" even the {forgive me} cheesyness of the superhero group. So anyone making a F.F. movie, even someone who wasn't Roger Corman, would have to struggle with this. This extends to the special effects, no amount of SFX will alter the fact that a guy wrapping his body around a rock-man is not going to be real believable!<br /><br />On the plus side:<br /><br />-This F.F. filmmaker would still have Stan Lee's words, written during a time of extreme civil-strife and change, still ring true, urging us to "judge, not on appearances, but actions" I believe that that message, is still apparent in this 2005 film version.<br /><br />-Good casting is an factor working in this films favor, especially (Michael C.'s)the Thing, who like the comic is the most interesting, the most "human" character. This was the sledge-hammer irony Stan Lee was going for in the comic and it remains in the film. The Johnny Storm / Ben Grim dynamic is fun, if forced, this is perhaps the single across-the-board flaw of the film. Everything is a little forced, to the altering of the origin to include Dr. Doom, down to the need to untransform the Thing. I would rather have seen the Galactus/ Silver Surfer storyline intergrated into an origin story (while we're forcing things here.)<br /><br />Even in the world of post-Spider-Man movies, Fantastic Four is still a comic book movie, not a Graphic Novel movie or an art house film. It is a fun film, no more, no less.<br /><br />Mr. Fantastic's hair maybe alittle too fantastic.</p></body></html>

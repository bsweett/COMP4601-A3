Sarah is engaged to an adorable man played by Mark Ruffalo but Beau has his ways with her just as he did with mom and grandma. Sarah ventures into temptation territory while her fiance is left wondering just what is going on. A few twists and turns has Sarah wondering about her paternity but breaking the female curse of Beau proves daunting.<br /><br />This could have been a great movie especially with the comedic talents of Jennifer Aniston and the always superb Shirley MacLaine. The plot wears thin and not even Kevin Costner's charm can rescue it. The movie is saleable and Mark Ruffalo a worthy contender for Aniston's affections but it just doesn't melt in the heart.</p></body></html>

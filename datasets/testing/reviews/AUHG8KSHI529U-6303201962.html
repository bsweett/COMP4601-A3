<meta name="summary" content="A great Star Trek story and much superior to the first film"></head><body><p>Now 25 years old, this movie still holds up very well.  I remember how delighted we fans were when we heard that Star Trek was going to be made into a movie.  The first film was mixed for most fans.  We were glad to see the characters on the screen, but the feel of the film was too big and the story was off somehow.  This movie was the second film and everyone cheered because it was a Star Trek story through and through, with even some of the characteristic inconsistencies (Khan remembering Chekov when he wasn't even part of the crew in the TV episode), the just in time miracles, and much more.<br /><br />Ricardo Montalban is spectacular as the genetically altered Khan Noonien Singh that Kirk had left on a lush planet fifteen years before.  Kirk is now an admiral who is uncomfortable with old age and leaving his starship, a new crew is being trained to take over the Enterprise, and Chekov is on an expedition on the Reliant with Captain Clark Terrell (well played by Paul Winfield).  Terrell and Chekov set down on a waste planet and discover evidence of Khan's existence on this planet and try to flee, but it is too late.<br /><br />The rest of the film is Khan drawing Kirk into an obsessed confrontation much like Ahab and Moby Dick.  You can pretty much guess that it is just as unlikely to end well for Khan.  It is the path the confrontation takes that is so interesting for Trek fans.  And the famous denouement is either quite moving or an impossible hoot, depending on how seriously you take these stories.  I was moved by the way they played it.  It was the next movie that we all had to swallow hard to believe, but it got us back to where we needed the story to be.<br /><br />Hey, at least they didn't make it a dream or something from an autistic child, right?<br /><br />We watched this with my teenage son last night, and he enjoyed it a great deal, so new generations continue to become fans of this series.  As well they should.</p></body></html>

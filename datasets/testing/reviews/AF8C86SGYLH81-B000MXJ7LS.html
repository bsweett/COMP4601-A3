<meta name="summary" content="5 Stars for Stone and an amazing cast"></head><body><p>Yesterday, on the 9th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we watched Oliver Stone's "World Trade Center". It is a terrific film (third time I've seen it) and captures the tragedy very well. Four superb acting performances make this a 5 star gem. They are Nicolas Cage, Michael Pena, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello. It is a very emotional film and brings back those horrible memories of that fateful day. But it also captures the bravery and heroism of the police, firefighters and volunteers. The "World Trade Center" will definitely send chills down your spine and will bring tears to your eyes. While it may unveil as a very depressing film, it is so invigorating at the end and makes you proud to be an American. Give it a try...but don't be afraid to turn it off if it's too intense.  You won't be disappointed.  Oliver Stone has never disappointed me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="AVP: Alien vs Predator........"></head><body><p>Alien vs Predator is a science fiction film, made in 2004, that bring the two beloved sci-fi franchises of fans all over together. It was a concept that was brought together in a comic series of the same name in 1989. Directed by W.S. Anderson(best known for "Event Horizon"& "Mortal Kombat"), it stars Sanaa Lathan, Lance Henriksen, Raoul Bova, and Colin Salmon. Alien vs. Predator follows a group assembled by billionaire Charles 'Bishop' Weyland (Lance Henriksen) for an expedition near the Antarctic after discovering a mysterious heat signal. Hoping to claim the find for himself, Weyland and the group discover a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station. Little do they know that it is a hunting ground for Predators who kill Aliens as a part of "coming of age" ritual. Despite harsh critism about the movie from movie reviewers and fans alike, it did well at the box-office ranking 33rd over all for the year as the highest-grossing film of that year. It has also did well by DVD sales and whatnot. In my opinion, AVP is a fun romp definitely worth owning just to see my two favorite space lifeforms duking it out til the end. It's a heck of a sight better than "Freddy vs Jason"(I truly mean that, I'm afraid). The unrated edition contains the special features from the Extreme Edition, CGI and an extra eight minutes of footage. That goes a long way in making  the movie that much better. So, regardless of what you hear about it, check out AVP:Alien vs Predator. It's a really good movie.</p></body></html>

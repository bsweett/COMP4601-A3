Do not expect subdued taste and restraint, but instead a kind of operatic ecstasy. At three hours it is even operatic in length, as its themes unfold, its characters strive against the dying of the light, and the great wheel of chance rolls on toward them." Roger Ebert<br /><br />Eleven people caught in LA who's lives intertwine during the film. A film of such magnitude that I had to stop and try to put pieces together. I have seen this film three times and each time am struck by the brilliance of director, Paul Anderson.  How did he keep all of these characters in place and put together?<br /><br />One life runs into another and another. Great performances all.  Need, love, humanness, forgiveness, anger, hate, joy, are all brought to the fore within these characters.  Tom Cruise in one of his best performances as the crude Frank- 'The Cock Has It'. Jason Robards as the drying man so loved and hated. Julianne Moore as his young wife, hooked on drugs and trying to find her place in life. Philip Seymour has the nurse who loves his patient and tries to do all he can to fulfill their last wishes. John C Riley, as the cop trying to find love and truth .  William Macy as the child prodigy quiz kid who never grows up. Phillip Baker Hall as the TV quiz master who has cheated and lied and wants forgiveness as he is dying. Their are other connections, the young quiz kid who wants his father to be nicer to him. The father who wants his kid to bring him fame and fortune. The young woman hooked on cocaine trying to forget her life. All of these lives come together and in the final minutes of the film the skies open up and all have their lives in front of them.<br /><br />"Magnolia"makes it three-for-three for writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson, 29, who follows Hard Eight and Boogie Nights with his most ardent and ambitious movie yet. Anderson keeps a tight lid on his work so that audiences can approach his character-based dramas with a sense of discovery. Fair enough. Magnolia is one of the best movies of the year - startling, innovative, hugely funny and powerfully, courageously moving."<br />Peter Travers<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended.  prisrob 04-16-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN2Z">Collateral (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014GI6I2">The Savages</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000639GL">Eugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten (Broadway Theatre Archive)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLQH">Far from Heaven</a></p></body></html>

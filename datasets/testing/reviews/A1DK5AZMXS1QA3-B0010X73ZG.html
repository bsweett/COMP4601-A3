<meta name="summary" content="Best film adaptation of a Stephen King horror book"></head><body><p>Prior to this movie release, of all the stories by Stephen King, only the non-horror ones were any good.  Theatrical releases such as Christine and Dreamcatcher were utterly horrible, while the made-for-TV horror movies such as The Tommyknockers and the Langoliers were also bad.  On the other hand, the non-horror ones were excellent.  These included Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Green Mile, and Misery.  Then came The Mist, released in 2007.  This adaptation of a short story is probably the best horror movie released this decade that was not based of a Japanese story.  Though based on a short story, the movie clocks in at over two hours; long for a horror movie.  The plot is very believable, and the casting is excellent.  No big names in this movie, instead the story has a cast of a dozen characters that drive it forward; all of whom play important parts.  The ending is also great.<br /><br />As to the content, there is some gore, but it is not excessive.  There is some violence, but it does not dominate the story, and instead is only an extension of certain subplots.  The scenes requiring special effects are kept to a minimum, but those scenes are extremely well done and all the monsters look quite real.  Most importantly, there are no stupid scenes in the movie.  There is no scene of a guy running from a monster and then tripping.  There is no scene of some lady hiding from a monster, and then giving away her presence by tripping.  Each and every scene was well thought out and well done.  All in all, a great movie.</p></body></html>

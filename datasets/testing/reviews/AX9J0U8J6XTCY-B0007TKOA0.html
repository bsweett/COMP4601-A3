<meta name="summary" content="great wine, whine country film.........."></head><body><p>absolutely awesome film-hands down, the best of 2004, or should have been. incredible performances from all 4 principal actors, esp. paul giamatti, are superb! the film cannot be described-it must be "smelled", like a great glass of wine, in this case, a pinot. but the film, the story, everything about it is truly astounding from start to great finish! i had to see it twice in a packed movie house, now i am so over anxiously waiting for this superb dvd, i can barely breathe waiting for it's tuesday release. it is hilarious, sad, hypotrical, great-i mean great acting by all, i could go on for an hour here, but i won't! it is a real masterpiece of a comedy with raw, sore, human emotions that literally begs for a 2nd and third viewing. it'a s real keeper, an instant classic, and one masterpiece of a film!  bravos to all the marvelous cast-kudos for the producer/director for attempting it in the first place!  get it or rent it, but watch it over and over-the wine/whine will so very much go to yourhead, you are apt never to forget it-i have not been able to get it out of my mind since the theater!  B R A V O S!  A REALLY MARVELOUS CLASSIC OF INTAMICY AND A HIGH LEVEL OF BEAUTY AND REALISM LIKE WE'VE NOT SEEN BEFORE.</p></body></html>

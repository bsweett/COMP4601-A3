<meta name="summary" content="A Lifelong Civilian's Review of Jarhead"></head><body><p>Am I too easily impressed by Jarhead because I was never a member of the military?  Do those who have actually served find the film to be over the top and a distortion of reality?  Whatever, I can only say that I enjoyed Jarhead immensely.  We sleep peacefully only because such brutal and well trained individuals are guarding our nation.  The concerns of Thomas Hobbes must be resolved long before we can pay attention to the democratic principles of John Locke.  Anthony Swofford's experiences as a Marine sniper during Desert Storm shows the less than perfect humanity of those who kill the sworn enemies of the United States.  These brave men are often vulgar, excessively macho, and rarely politically correct.  They are sent into harm's way by our elected officials.  Do they always understand the purpose of their sacrifices?  No, sometimes our committed warriors are perplexed.  A secular faith in the democratic process is required.  Civilians ultimately make the decisions---and the military must obey.  Swofford and his buddies are ordered to defeat Saddam Hussein's attempt to monopolize the oil industry in the Middle East.  At the end, the dictator is humiliated but survives.  Our politicians decide not to eradicate Saddam's regime.  Might this disillusion the more idealistic Marine? It doesn't matter. A Marine must obey. This is the way it has to be.  Utopia is not possible on this side of the grave.  A democratic society can only do the best it can.<br /><br />There are no weak performances in Jarhead.  The acting is superb.  To an outsider like myself, these Marines seem like the real deal.  Take a chance on this film.  The risk is worth it.  I consider Jarhead to be a five star experience.  Maybe you will agree.<br /><br />David Thomson<br />Flares into Darkness</p></body></html>

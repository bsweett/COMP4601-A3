Although Hannibal is the 2nd movie released in The Silence Of The Lambs trilogy, it is actually meant to be the final movie. Red Dragon follows Hannibal but Red Dragon is actually the prequel to The Silence Of The Lambs. I rate this movie equally with Red Dragon, 4 stars. Once again, Anthony Hopkins delivers an outstanding and brilliant performance as Lecter. Although Jodie Foster is not in this movie ( wish she would have been ), Julianne Moore does give a good performance as Clarice Starling. It's hard not to compare her to Foster in this movie but it doesn't take away from this wonderful thriller. Great horror and violence in this one! as we see Lecter re-emerge in Italy. But this time, someone else has it in for Lecter and Starling is now on the case, trying to locate Lecter. Alot of violence and blood in this one! It will truly keep you entertained from beginning to end. Very well done! Very well written! and truly delivers as the sequel to Silence Of The Lambs!!! A must see for Lecter fans!!</p></body></html>

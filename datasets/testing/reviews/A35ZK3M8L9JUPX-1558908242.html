<meta name="summary" content="Pulp Fiction"></head><body><p>An inside look at a memorable community of criminals. Prizefighter Butch Coolidge has decided to stop payment on a deal he's made with the devil. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are a couple of young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue. Meanwhile, two career criminals, Vincent Vega and Jules, go about their daily business of shooting up other crooks who are late on payments. The kind of movie you look forward to seeing again even as you're watching it. This movie is wild, unique, smart and hilarious. A rare masterpiece.</p></body></html>

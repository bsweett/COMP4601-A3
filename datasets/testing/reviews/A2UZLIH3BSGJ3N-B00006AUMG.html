<meta name="summary" content="Almost as good as the original"></head><body><p>I liked the sequal slightly less than the original.While this film still possess the kill'em all,take no prisoners attitude by our favorite vampire killer Blade,there was something about this film...it lacked what the original had.It is still greatly entertaining,and the boosted quality in the cgi effects are great,as well as the makeup.It has a decent storyline,and it follows through with a good finish,setting up our hero for his next venture(soon to be released in December).It's a good movie,and well worth watching and owning.</p></body></html>

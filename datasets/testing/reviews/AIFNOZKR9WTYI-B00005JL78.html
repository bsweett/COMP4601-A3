<meta name="summary" content="We Went to Sleep by Dialing O"></head><body><p>Sleepwalking through yet another role Tom Cruise tries bravely to carry the movie on his back.  He's lying there in the hot sun moving his legs trying to turn over but he can't.  And the writer's aren't helping.<br />Whaddya mean they're not helping?<br />I mean they're not helping.<br />Apparently the movie is a test, designed to evoke an emotional response.  The emotion is ennui or malaise or boredom or apathy.  Get VKed on a film like this one and it's gonna be pretty hard to tell whether or not you're a replicant.  However there might be a certain involuntary dilation of the iris as you think of the five portraits of George Washington that are no longer in your hip pocket.<br />I would rate this movie Double-Plus Ungood.  Furthermore I would have the writers sent to the Ministry of Love and have them replaced by novel-writing machines.  But actually, come to think of it, it is entirely possible that Minority Report was written by machines - the literary equivalent of a Quisinart.  All you do is take the standard shlock Hollywood thriller plot formula, add in every old sci fi film you can think of, Metropolis, Blade Runner, Logan's Run, and some old Humphrey Bogart movie I forget the name of.  Hit the pulse button until these movies have been reduced to disjointed fragments, add an emulsifier and you can move out of Central and take the tubeway home early, just in time to feed your electric sheep.</p></body></html>

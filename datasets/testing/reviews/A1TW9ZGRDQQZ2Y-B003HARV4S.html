Even Jessica Biel turns in a better than average performance. The sets, costumes, and musical score are all lovely, but the movie lacks something I can't quite put my finger on. The slow pace didn't bother me, but the love story didn't hold much water. The Illusionist is a movie worth seeing, but perhaps it is better suited for a DVD viewing.</p></body></html>

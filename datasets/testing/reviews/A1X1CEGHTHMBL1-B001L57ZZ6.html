<meta name="summary" content="Shades of Sky Watch taking over control of our government!"></head><body><p>Military leaders have come to depend on high tech electronics and advanced weapons to maintain our superiority in battle and in wars.  They have gone too far in creating "Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst" (ARIIA) who is a supercomputer watching the terrorist and all of us!<br /><br />Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is a college dropout who is barely making it through life.  He has nothing to do with the military except that his twin brother is an Air Force expert who is involved in top secret programs.  His twin brother is killed and after the funeral, Jerry finds a large amount of money in his bank account and when he gets home there is a large cache of weapons in his apartment.  The phone rings and a woman's voice tells him to run or he will be captured by the FBI in less than a minute...<br /><br />What follows is an exciting and action filled movie that leads Jerry on the run of his life for his life!  This is a continuous nonstop action movie and I enjoyed the movie very much. The acting is good and Rachael Hollowman (Michelle Monaghan) is the co-star and both her and Shia LaBeouf did well in portraying this story.<br /><br />The premise is over the top and as well as the action but it is so involving you just wind up getting wrapped up into the plot.  Both my wife and I enjoyed this movie and I believe you will too!</p></body></html>

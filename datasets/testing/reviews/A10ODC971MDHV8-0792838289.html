<meta name="summary" content="The Manchurian Candidate"></head><body><p>This story of a soldier brainwashed by Reds to kill the President is twisty and unnerving, building to a shattering crescendo. All the players are first-rate, in particular Angela Lansbury as the mother from hell, while Sinatra's portrayal of Marco reflects the dramatic high point of his film career. A nail-biting political thriller that warrants repeat viewings, "Candidate" is as relevant today as it was at the height of the Cold War. Beware inferior remake.</p></body></html>

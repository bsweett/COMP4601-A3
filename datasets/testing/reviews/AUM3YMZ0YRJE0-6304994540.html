It is a hollywood production at heart, even if it has quirky details.  So it was striving to be like an Indie film, sincerely striving.  That made it boring to me.  Nothing to savor.  This is the only Coen film that failed for me, as I am a big fan of their other work.<br /><br />Not recommended, unless your like lazy bowlers who get into improbably wierd adventures.</p></body></html>

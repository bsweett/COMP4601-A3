<meta name="summary" content="Diminishing Returns for the Wes Anderson Catalog"></head><body><p>I intentionally delayed viewing this film for awhile as Wes Anderson's previous films failed to impress or satisfy me, more notably with The Royal Tenebaums and The Life Aquatic. Unfortunately, this film also fails miserably to redeem Wes Anderon's filmography; moreover, it only reinforces how out of touch Wes Anderson's writing has been with regard to his innate ability for crafting likable characters.<br /><br />Personally, my two favorite Wes Anderson films (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore) which I am sure are also popular beloved favorites among Wes Anderson fans like myself excelled in bringing fictional characters to life; characters that were incredibly distinct, unique and special; characters that were so flawed but nonetheless had many qualities that was so likable; characters that you could easily relate to but not entirely understand. Wes Anderson was truly an artist in bringing these types of characters to life because he knew exactly how to render them likable and so interesting. Personally, I felt that any writer who can craft someone purely fictional but leave an audience with an intense desire to follow that character through more interactions is a highly talented one. Wes Anderson fully succeeded with this task in his first two installments. I mean is it really necessary to express how much replay value Bottle Rocket or Rushmore possess within each viewing ?<br /><br />  In this little mishap, Wes Anderson takes us to India where the Whitman Brothers rendezvous on a train, "The darjeeling Limited" , to embark on a spiritual journey since it has been a year seeing each other after their father's funeral. This journey was planned by Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) and even goes as far as to the trouble of creating an organized itinerary. The two other brothers, Peter Whitman (Adrian Brody) and Jack Whitman, (Jason Schrwatzman) do not seem as enthusiastic but comply with Francis's wishes nonetheless. Francis, who appears in the entire film covered with overwhelming but comically placed bandages is recovering from a serious motorcycle accident, meanwhile, Peter has left his 7 1/2 month pregnant wife back at home without telling her where he has gone. Finally, Jack, a novelist, who incessantly attempts to reconnect with an ex-girlfriend (Natalie Portman) but cannot seem to tone down his propensities for non-attached flings seems to struggle with many emotional dilemmas. Along this spiritual journey, Francis reveals to his two brothers another motive for this journey to which they express utter disappointment at first when Francis discloses to them that he wants to reunite with their estranged mother (Angelica Houston) in the Himalayas. She is apparently running a convent there.<br /><br />This film came across as a lazy, watered down, imposter Wes Anderson without all the bells and whistles. Nothing seemed genuine at all in the film. All of the positive and stand out qualities that were so prevalent in previous Wes Anderson films were just downright diluted in this one or carelessly non-existent. The Indian setting that may seem appropriate for the mournful spiritual journey was not at all interesting nor inviting. The characters were incredibly dull, wooden and just plain boring, nor did any of the characters have any particular uniqueness that was worth noting either. The chemistry among the characters was essentially non-existent and that is probably because all of them were exactly the same. Like another reviewer on here who also expressed his discontent with the film in its entirety by asking the same question I asked too at the end of the film, "Who Cares" ? I found myself caring less and less about the characters as the film dragged on it's slow, empty and very unfulfilling journey. Quite frankly, there was not one ounce of spirit in this film except maybe in the soundtrack/score which was also not one of Wes Anderson's finest choice. Looking back at this film in particular as well as Wes Anderson's other previous disappointments, I can't help but to feel a sort of arrogance spawning out of the once rejuvenating director of indie films. According to Wes Anderson, an unusual setting, dull characters with zero depth but a dash of quirkiness is just enough to attract new fans and retain the old ones. Wrong.  It appears Bottle Rocket and Rushmore will remain at the pinnacle of Mr. Anderson catalog until he finds his true self again or finds a new career.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A darker Coen brothers film"></head><body><p>I am surprised at the number of negative reviews here.  For some, it seems they don't realize that the Coen brothers didn't write the story of No Country for Old Men.  It's a novel by Cormac McCarthy, and the Coens take great swathes of dialogue and narration verbatim from the book.  I also don't understand what is pretentious about this movie.  It's a fairly straightforward regional thriller set in west Texas in 1980, when violence seem to get more violent as cocaine and heroine started to flow into the United States at an alarming rate.  This new brand of drug dealing gives birth to pure evil, incarnated in the character of Anton Chigurh (played wonderfully by Javier Bardem).  I can see how this kind of a story may not be for everyone.  The violence in this film is serious unlike Raising Arizona and the regionalisms aren't meant to be as funny as in Fargo (although I laughed a lot at the west Texan wit and colloquialisms in this film).<br /><br />The cinematography and sound are excellent as in all Coen brothers' movies, and the acting is spectacular.  Josh Brolin performs well as the resourceful Llewelyn Moss.  He is able to work a scene by himself with no music and no dialogue.  Tommy Lee Jones gives a good performance as a tired old sheriff, Ed Tom Bell.  Even Woody Harrelson does a decent impression of a professional hit man.  But it's Javier Bardem who steals the movie.  He delivers his lines in a measured, very low and gravelly voice.  His Spanish accent comes and goes at surprising times, often in the middle of words.  He has what must be the devil's haircut; he's one of the creepiest human characters I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />Cormac McCarthy seems to have accidently written No Country for Old Men for the Coen brothers.  It shares many elements with their previous films: regionalism, movements from wide open to claustrophobic spaces, Western motifs, cartoon and nightmare natures of violence, and surrealism.  The Coen brothers do a fine job, and I recommend the film to all of their fans.</p></body></html>

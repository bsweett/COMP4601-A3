<meta name="summary" content="Beware of Sy the loser"></head><body><p>Martin Buber taught that we should never treat anyone in an abstract and distant I-It manner. The great philosopher instead advocated I-Thou relationships between ourselves and those who interact with us even in minor ways.  Nonetheless, Buber might have changed his mind had he ever met Sy Parrish (Robin Williams).  The one hour photo technician desires far more intimacy with his customers than is psychologically healthy and normally desirable.  Sy is a loser who bewilderingly is content earning a mediocre income as a store clerk/film developer for a large discount chain store.  He looks upon this pathetic job as a serious vocation instead of one barely paying a few cents above minimum wage.  The only fault I could find in this great five star film is the portrayal of Sy as somebody able to afford a nice car, live in a fairly large apartment, and eat out on a regular basis.  This is totally absurd.  In the real world a Sy would barely be able to pay for a cramped efficiency apartment and a beat up older automobile.  <p>Sy focuses his unwanted attention onto the affluent and outwardly happy Yorkin family.  The young couple and their nine year old son have no idea that Sy's world revolves around their own lives.  We are sometimes tempted to turn our heads away from the screen while observing Sy embarrassingly making a fool of himself.  Robin Williams is uncannily brilliant as a warped human being with nothing going for himself.  And yes, Williams will almost certainly garner an Academy Award nomination for his brilliant interpretation of Sy.  Williams' recent work in Insomnia as similarly a creepy weirdo may also earn him a supporting role nomination.  Is it possible that Williams' earlier comedic roles will soon be forgotten?  Will Sy Parrish be to Williams as Norman Bates was to Tony Perkins?  Has Williams crossed a line in his career where there is no going back?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sad Story Looking For a Plot"></head><body><p>This is a sad film that never seems to develop a point or a plot and then the screen writer kills off the character(s) just to end the pain. Actually this is a film with too many plot beginnings but none ever seem to develop or go anywhere.  There is the relationship between the father and son, but that is never given any real motivation, developed in any meaningful way, and ends in a reconciliation without ever offering any rationale.  Then there is the interrelations between the family members that is hinted at but not explored.  Of course there is the almost plot regarding the school bullies, but that is set up and then abandoned as a plot line so it is never brought to any sort of point or conclusion.  Of course there is the relationship between Jess and Leslie which apparently is intended as the plot and it gets the most attention but it never seems to go anywhere which is unfortunate because this could have been a glorious film, but Terribithia appears in only the last two minutes of the film.  So the imagination which should have driven the film was hinted at but never developed.  Then there was the art and the art teacher which was again introduced as a possible subplot but then abandoned.  This entire film consisted of potential plot lines that are never explored leaving the entire film as a hash of directionless and pointless actions.  Then because there was no point and no plot bringing the film to any sort of conclusion required the death, which was again pointless and contributed nothing to the film, other than to stop the action and end the film.<br /><br />I gave the film two stars as a charitable contribution to the actors who did their best with a bad screen play.</p></body></html>

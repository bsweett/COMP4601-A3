<meta name="summary" content="The story that brought irony to comics"></head><body><p>This movie offers plenty to like and a little to dislike. On the liking side, it does a great job of adapting Moore's complex story to the big screen. Of course, a few things had to be sacrificed, but what came though seems true to the 1980s original. As a comics movie, you might expect a major effects-fest, and the CGI crew delivers brilliantly. Most of all, Moore's original vision of switchback plot twists and moral ambiguity comes through as jarringly as it did when the original mini-series came out, back in the 1980s.<br /><br />That's also what some viewers will dislike. The movie addresses complex issues that we still face, including war, crime against women, and deciding whether ends justify means. Like the real world, this doesn't supply easy answers. The viewer isn't supposed to come away certain that justice has been served or that the good guys won. That's where I find another incongruity. The story addresses deep issues, but does so with shallow characters.<br /><br />There's a lot more to say about Watchmen's place in graphic novel history, but this isn't the place for that discussion. It's a good story, but it aged. This movie brings that story to life beautifully, but carries those signs of age with it. Go ahead, enjoy this one (at least, the parts you're supposed to enjoy), but don't expect it to change the universe of comic book movies.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

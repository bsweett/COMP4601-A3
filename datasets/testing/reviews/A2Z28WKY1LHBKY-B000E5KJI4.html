These stories had been told and re-told, each bard adding and omitting to suit his audience and his own temperament. There seems nothing wrong, therefore, for a modern team of writer and film director to do their own thing, especially as they have deliberately changed the title of their tale, making it quite clear that they are not aiming to reproduce the classic Iliad. Any criticism which complains that Benioff and Petersen don't precisely follow Homer (if he ever existed) is barking up the wrong tree.<br /><br />This is a stunning, intriguing and fascinating movie in its own right. At first one may be taken aback, for other reasons besides its deviation from its inspiration. The dialogue is curiously throwaway and informal, to anyone brought up on the sententiously stilted posturing and declaiming of traditional celluloid epics. A number of reviewers are annoyed by what they regard as the inaccuracies and anachronisms of social life, battle techniques, armour, equipment and so forth. The fact is that no one is quite sure when, if ever, the famous siege of Troy took place --- and there is even some doubt as to where. All that is certain is that it was in the past; a long, long, time ago. This aspect is conveyed with tremendous effect. At the same time, the actions, motivations, behaviour and psychology of the individuals is bang up-to-date, and extremely convincing. The political power-play, the arrogant insubordination of Achilles, the dependency and resentful hatred of the boss, ring true. Achilles' petulance is a strong and crucial feature of the familiar version. Brad Pitt's performance, and ability to convey his utter superiority as a killing machine on the battle-field, is exceptional. The fact is that the Iliad itself centres on Achilles; his grimly fatalistic attitude, and his acceptance of a short, spectacular life instead of unmemorable longevity.<br /><br />The absence of the Gods is complained of. I didn't feel this in any way at all. The Gods are present in this movie, just as much as they are in Homer. No contemporary actually imagined that Aphrodite, Ares, Apollo and the rest appeared on the battlefield. They were conscious, however, of how little men could do to take charge of their own destinies. The hidden presence of the Gods was finely suggested: these ancient humans are presented as if in the grip of outside forces. They are doomed by fate to act out their given roles, which the Gods have decided for them. Freedom and choice were illusory. They still are --- although we are obliged to believe that we are in control of our own lives.<br /><br />Some reviewers have criticized the performances of Paris and Helen. I don't get it. The actress is beautiful, and that is all she has to be. She is merely the face that launched the thousand ships: the excuse for the war, not the real reason. Her changing expressions as she enters Troy for the first time speak volumes. Paris is a feckless playboy, a lover not a fighter, but a good archer.<br /><br />This film is stuffed with mind-expanding ideas, superb performances, spectacular action and scenery. The computer graphics are inevitable, these days, but they do conjure up powerful images. This is certainly one of the best epics I have seen --- perhaps the very best; and I'm astonished by the number of negative reviews.</p></body></html>

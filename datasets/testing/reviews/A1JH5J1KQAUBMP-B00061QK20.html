<meta name="summary" content="The beautiful story of a merciless warlord"></head><body><p>A warrior known only as Nameless (Jet Li) presents himself to the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), who is engaged in the forceful unification of the separate lands that will one day constitute China.  Nameless claims to have slain the three master assassins (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, and Donnie Yen) that have dedicated themselves to destroying the King, and the king allows Nameless to come within 100 paces of the throne to relate his adventure.  When he has finished, the king has his own interpretation of events, which throws doubt on all we have heard.  Both versions are presented in flashback.<br /><br />This film has an interesting structure and a good basic story, but ultimately emerges as an overblown homage to a tyrant.  All of the main characters are presented as beings who exist on a rarefied plane where every act and thought is fraught with nuance and philosophical implication.  This includes the King of Qin, who is not simply a conquering despot, but a selfless philosopher-king who just happens to command an enormous army and doesn't flinch at slaughtering his opponents, even when they offer no resistance, such as the passive students of a calligraphy school.  The strong jingoistic slant is perhaps not surprising, given that this is the most expensive film in Chinese history; I suppose that government cooperation does not come without strings attached.<br /><br />In addition to the above objections, the film is just plain overblown.  I loved "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."  It featured incredible wirework and beautiful cinematography as well, but it was all in service of a compelling story and a convincing romance.  Director Zhang Yimou spares no effort to outdo Ang Lee's film by straining to make every single frame beautiful with a capital B.  Everything is color-coordinated, wind-blown, perfectly lighted, and slo mo.  He seems to have forgotten that a fight scene should also be exciting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You've GORT to be kidding me!"></head><body><p>Regina Jackson: I want to apologize to you; it seems we got off to a bad start.<br />Klaatu: It seems we did.<br /><br />In fact, if the Secretary of Defense (Kathy Bates) and Klaatu the alien (Keanu Reeves) were referring to this movie in the above conversation; I'd have to disagree and say that it got off to a rather good start, but then blasted itself to smithereens with its overwhelming emphasis on special effects.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Government hastily gathers group of eggheads and gives them just over an hour to deal with an unknown object which is hurtling through space at unbelievable speed and is just about ready to touch down in Manhattan.<br />2. Instead of telling the almost certainly destructive force to take a number, due to the long waiting list of aliens, creatures and other movies impatiently awaiting their turn to destroy the city of New York, the eggheads put on funny suits and take a walk in the Park.<br />3. A close encounter with an alien in a fat suit and a big ole robot named GORT follows.<br />4. Given the acting in this movie, the audience may have a hard time figuring out which of the emotionless beings is the alien Klaatu.<br />5. Keanu may actually have been better off being casted as GORT.<br />6. Apparently, the aliens have their plan well worked out in advance, and have the balls to prove it.<br />7. Unlike the human race, this movie is hardly worth saving.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 15, 2009</p></body></html>

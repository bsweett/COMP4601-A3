I couldn't relax while the march was on, nor while the males and females struggled to preserve new life. Because the film so endears the viewer to the penguins, their loss becomes your own. But their triumph also fills you with joy. Too, the film wouldn't have been the same without the voice of Morgan Freeman. His voice was one of this documentary's selling points for me. Educational and entertaining, this film is definitely a must-see. It's rated G, but there are some very sad moments. Be prepared to experience a full range of emotions.</p></body></html>

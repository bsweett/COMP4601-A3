<meta name="summary" content="A timeless film!"></head><body><p>This movie combined a very captivating and multi dimensional story . Indeed , this movie is much more than a simple love story , but it is much more than a sad chapter in the middle of the war . This film reached and developed its own profile due precisely its kinetic flexibility and brilliant engaging charm , keeping in mind several fundamental factors.<br /><br />Obviously the personal charisma of Julie Andrews who somehow was the british answer of the lovely Audrey Hepburn . Andrews owned her own charm : radiance , sweetness and beauty in the purest british mood .<br /><br />The absorbing and magnetic presence of Christopher Plummer , a very gifted actor who actually is giving a towering and recognized performance in Broadway .<br /><br />The rest of the cast was a goldness triumph . Who can forget those lovely kids ?<br /><br />The admirable direction and the spectacular landscapes were too undeniable elements who added its contribution for this eternal picture .<br /><br />A film to enjoy over and over again!</p></body></html>

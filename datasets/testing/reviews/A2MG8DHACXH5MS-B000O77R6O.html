The Fountain is Sci Fi meets epic romance and I'm really glad Hugh Jackman was in this role rather than the original actor cast for the part - Brad Pitt. Jackman is Tomas, Tommy, and Tom in 1500, 2000, and 2500 in a relentless search for a cure to save his love Isabella, Isabelle, Issy. The trio of characters all play into one another but are still distinct. Jackman is an international film star in his own right but his more private relationship with the papparazzi allows his thespian gifts to shine in a more opaque light. Jackman melts into the different personalities that are weaved together in The Fountain. We see his role not his celebrity life clouding a stellar performance. Being a trained actor skilled in singing and dancing makes Jackman a belivable cast of Tomas, Tommy, and Tom in a psychedelic twist of karma and fate across the centuries. He melts into the role with his muse Isabelle/Issy/Isabella whom he spends centuries trying to save. The timing of this film released at the height of Brangelina is poignat because had Brad Pitt stayed in the lead it may have been unbelievable to audiences of the character's mad devotion to stay with his wife. This is what makes the film work.<br /><br />Jackman emotes well and plays a Spanish conquistador, American medical doctor, and space age explorer all in one without seeming like the same character each time. Cris crossing between three different lifetimes over a millenium to save the woman he loves The Fountain plays on karma, reincarnation, and endless love and its quest to conquer death. The ending is odd because you don't know whether he succeeds or not and it heartbreaking since it isn't clear if the lovers unite. A well done film that blends distinct story lines into a captivating tale that concludes in a unique way. I'm impressed albeit confused. All that said, mark my words, one day movie trailers will promote Academy Award Winner Hugh Jackman in films he stars in. It's evident in The Fountain that, pretty soon, fellow Australian Russell Crowe won't just be sharing the land down under with Jackman, but also an Oscar trophy.</p></body></html>

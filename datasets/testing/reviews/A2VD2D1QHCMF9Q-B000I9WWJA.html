<meta name="summary" content="Just plain awful!"></head><body><p>This is an attempt at sophistication that just doesn't hack it.  Jodie Foster's character, for one example, is so pretentious and obnoxious that one is tempted to reach into the screen and slap her face.<br /><br />The language that everyone uses, particularly the Mayor, is so full of obscenities that it is just not credible.  Filthy language for the sake of filthy language is just filthy.<br /><br />The story, where Denzel Washington's character appears to finally understand what is going on with the bank robbers, is just too obscure and nonsensical for anyone to figure out, even Denzel Washington.<br /><br />If there is some kind of message her, like criminals will finally be found out and will receive justice, it is lost in the juvenile way in which this movie is presented.  Just plain awful.</p></body></html>

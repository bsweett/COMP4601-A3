I'm a big fan of the original, it had so much impact and is still relevant today, and it's hard to imagine someone doing a better zombie movie than Romero himself. But, I gave this movie it's fair shake. I remembered last year's "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," and how everyone though it was going to be a bust, yet, the movie improved on ideas from the original and went straight to the jugular with the horror. "Dawn Of The Dead," however, does neither of these things. In fact, this version plays out more like an action flick than a horror. The zombies this time around, not content to lumbering around, are lively than ever (rigor-mortis what?) and go after their food with swift speed and tenacity, which you would think makes a movie scarier. But it doesn't. All I kept thinking in the back of my mind was "What a "28 Days Later" rip-off." Don't get me wrong, I loved that movie, but it shouldn't be the meter-stick by which all future zombie movies are measured (especially since they weren't really zombies in that movie). Director Zack Snyder does an overall good job with the material, as a first time director, you can't discount him much. When viewing the supplemental material on the DVD, you get the sense that he is excited by the material and really loves the genre. The good intentions were there with this movie, but for many reasons, it just unravels. For starters, I found myself laughing in spots that I shouldn't have laughed at (Am I the only one who busted a gut laughing at the part where Ana's husband is chasing her, gives up and then attacks some random lady just standing there?). The movie tried to inject light-hearted moments and some bits of black humor into parts that should have been played a bit more seriously. I hardly felt any tension in this movie (maybe something to do with hearing a swing version of Distured's "Down With The Sickness?"). The characters aren't much to write home about, either. In the unrated cut, there is an introduction done by Snyder himself explaining how much extra character work is injected in the new cut. Boy, would I have hated to see this movie in theaters! What character? Characters go through hell and back, and seem to forget about it all in the span of a few days. One character, who lost her husband and daughter falls for the leader of the group after only, what, a week? The only character who manages to grab the emotional resonance of the situation is Mekhi Phifer's (he's great in this movie). Great actors like Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames are just wasted here and not given much to do. The characters do stupid things and half the time, I can't be sympathetic when they bite it (literally). The good parts of this movie, however, are the action. When something happens, it happens. I loved the part where the zombies were all pressed up against the fence, engulfed in flames. It looked like something straight out of Hell. Also, the gore was top-notch. True to the spirit of the original, there is no C.G.I. present (that I can tell -- I watch a lot of movies). Plus, we get cameos from actors who played in the original (Scott Reigner, Ken Foree, and Tom Savini). But overall, I walked away from "Dawn Of The Dead" 2004 with a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth -- which wasn't necessarily inspired by the throwaway ending (what was the point again?) There's cheap thrills to be had and for a first time out, Zack Snyder does a bang-up job. That's why it gets three stars and why I recommend at least one viewing. After watching this movie, I read that Eli Roth, director of "Cabin Fever" was approached to direct this movie, which makes perfect sense. This movie sets out to do a lot of things "Cabin Fever" did, mainly, injecting deadpan humor into deadpan horror. Unfortunately, it just doesn't pan out so well here.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrific Blu-Ray of a flawed but good comic book movie."></head><body><p>Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) has been conducting experiments with gamma radioation until one night he tries to save a friend's life in the lab and gets blasted with a dose of radioation. Banner survivors but whenever he becomes angry or outraged becomes a powerful and superstrong green skinned brute named The Hulk who's real gentle inside but doesn't like to be messed with. General Ross (Sam Elliot) and Glen Talbot (Josh Lucas) suspects something is going wrong, Bruce's love interest Betty (Jennifer Connely) must try to help with Banner's problems and that's the same for Banner's long lost father David (Nick Nolte) who enhances himself as well to become an absorbing monster.<br /><br />Quite different Sci-fi thriller based on Marvel's comic hero created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby is directed by Ang Lee. This one maybe a bit slow for some folks and didn't too well with audiences and some critics even critized for not having much Hulk action, Lee wanted to do an artsy take on the beloved Marvel character for i thought this was a very interesting movie. The casting was quite good even to Connelly who is just as sexy as ever, the special effects by ILM is flawed on the Hulk but in the second movie he looked better. Ang Lee did tried to get a major audience but at least he tried, the new Hulk movie was a vast improvement but this is still worth a watch.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers a kickass high defination transfer and terrific sound with good extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, and featurettes plus picture-in-picture click access for interviews and behind the scenes footage as you watch the movie.</p></body></html>

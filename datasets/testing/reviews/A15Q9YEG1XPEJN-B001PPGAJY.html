<meta name="summary" content="This movie kicks major booty and is a heck of a lot of fun!"></head><body><p>I'm giving this movie four stars out of 5 within its genre.<p>X2: X-Men United is an unbelievble follow-up to what was just a mediocre first film.  It isn't often that sequels are superior to the first film - in this case it is definitely true.<p>The first film wasn't horrible, but as a fan of the comics, it was disappointing on several casting levels as well as the plotline and flow.<p>X2 makes none of the first film's errors:  it is action from the moment the movie starts and it ends the same way.  A new mutant has infiltrated the White House and threatens the President.  For those of us familiar with the comics, we know this mutant to be Nightcrawler, but to those unfamiliar, you find out eventually.  In fact, this film manages to step up not only the action and the pace, but integrates a love triangle very prominent in the comics, and effectively uses a few other new mutants.  We are introduced to a mutant of unbelievably strong psychic power (Legion in the comics?) and are able to witness a pre-mutant Hank McCoy (Beast) on television, while witnessing a list of mutants whose names many will recognize.  These are just a few of the things that are thrown out there for the comics fans.  Possibly the biggest thing thrown out there to us is in the final moments of the film.  I won't divulge it here, but suffice it to say that those who haven't read the comics may feel that something is lacking in the ending of the film....For those of us who know the comics, we'll eagerly await the next installment.<p>I'm not necessarily nuts about the "mutated" life lines assigned to our heros.  (i.e. Iceman is one of the original X-Men, but the movie makes him a much younger novice.)  I'm also not nuts about the original casting of Halle Berry as Storm - yes, she's gorgeous and now that she's got an Oscar she's more of a draw than before - BUT - Chris Claremont once said that Storm was modelled after the model/actress Iman, who is not only very much alive, but doesn't look much different than she did years ago - and she IS African as Storm is supposed to be).<p>.....<p>X2: X-Men United is a really great action film that will have you laughing and cheering and leaving the theater wanting more!</p></body></html>

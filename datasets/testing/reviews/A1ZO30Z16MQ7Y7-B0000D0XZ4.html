<meta name="summary" content="The Hulk?"></head><body><p>There are a lot of things to like and a lot of things to hate so I put them in two different categories.<p>Good: The special effects are okay but of course, they don't make up for dumping Lou Ferrigno. The casting was good even if the TV series casting was better. Some good old memories are brought back when some guy comes out of no where and beat up Bruce Banner. Bad: Ending and Dog scene was bad (why was the Hulk fighting a poodle?). Breaking up the screen with several views was annoying<p>Overall this movie makes up for bad Cartoons, but the TV series is much better.</p></body></html>

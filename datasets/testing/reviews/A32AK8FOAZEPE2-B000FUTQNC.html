<meta name="summary" content="the airforce one is now grounded"></head><body><p>in a corporate environment. the guy who played the stone-cold killer should try his best to bail out from such stereotyped fixation asap, otherwise he might be doomed to play bad guys all the time, before he played this role, he was a very romantic tennis player, after this one, he was chosen again to play a killer in the da vinci code again since this was the second time he played like a catholic priest, not a good career path and it's quite narrow.<br /><br />harrison ford looked very old and puffy in this movie but still with his trademark facial tense, nervous features and expression that he used thousand times since 'star wars', 'fanatic', 'witness' and 'indiana jones'.<br /><br />this movie is so cliched and formulated, viewer might not be able to watch it by ridding the impression as watching a landing and grounded version of his 'airforce one', the only difference is in a bank building instead of a high flying boeing 747.<br /><br />the casting c.s.a. did a lousy job to cast some wimpy high school dropout like young guys played the bad bunch, not quite as vicious and convincing like we had seen in the 'airforce one'. funny thing is both movies casted british actors as the bad guys. are british actors look more vicious than americans?<br /><br />the screenplay is so cliched that almost every twist was predictable, and it dragged on and on and felt very tiresome and a bita longer to bear. but at least this one is better than what harrison did in his worst 'hollywood homicide'. he's the next sean connary, another great actor riding into the sunset.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Use of spectacular Blu ray with a quality film"></head><body><p>You have two camps of people with this film.  Some knock it totally saying it is in no way a horror movie.  Others see it for what it is.  It has never been called a horror film .  It has a presence of horror in a different way and is a true story that is more a courtroom drama that explores how the legal system deals with the case of a girl who died after an exorcism and while under the direct care of a priest.  Was she epileptic and psychotic?  Or was she possessed.  Medical facts verses spiritual facts.<br /><br />THE EXORCIST was a story that had the exorcism and gore galore in the forefront with the story of its characters in the background.  THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is about an exorcism with the strong story in the forefront.  This is a 5 star film.  We have three of the best actors of this decade - Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson and Scott Campbell.  These are hardcore actors and each tackles their role with strong intensity.<br /><br />Now before I continue I want to comment on how the film appears in blu ray.  It is absolutely astounding.  The 1080p high def picture is crystal clear and the truehd audio will blow you away.  This must be viewed with a 5.1 theater system.  I have seen this film many times and the clarity in blu ray makes the courtroom scenes seem as if I am watching a play and the actors are in my room.  The film does manage to expertly show the progression of Emily Rose's deterioration and if you view it with blu ray and a theater system the sound will have you on the edge of your seat and jumping out of your skin.  (Important note, if you watch DEXTER, it is great fun to see Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose.  She is superb.)<br /><br />Blu ray allows the viewer to see the emotions of the actos much more clearly.  Laura Linney is the attorney defending the priest accused of Emily's death and she is at first a self professed agnostic.  But the film is largely about how the whole affair affects her.  At the end she is very troubled and doesn't know what she is.  But her life is totally changed.  Even with all the great acting the film in my opinion belongs to Laura Linney and Jennifer Carpenter.<br /><br />If you want a standard B horror film with blood and gore this film is not for you.  This film is an insightful, intelligent courtroom drama about a very unique case and it is scary, suspenseful, troubling and dramatic but for different reasons.  Excellent film and even if you own the dvd you MUST purchase it on blu ray.  It is a demonstration of blu ray at its best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Glorious!"></head><body><p>Normally I write a movie review by approaching the script and the job done by the director, summarizing the plot a little and praising or panning various performances and CGI.<br /><br />I don't think I need to do that with "Narnia".  I reveled in the books as a child, and I found the film experience to be...thrilling.  Beautiful.  Engrossing.  Spectacular.  I hung on every word and scene.  A visual feast.  Bravo to the filmmakers!</p></body></html>

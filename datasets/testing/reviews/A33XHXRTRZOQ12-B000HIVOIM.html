It was the second action flick for director Paul Verhoeven, who initially hit the American market with an art film starring Jeroen Krabbe called "The 4th Man". Apparently, he hasn't looked back since "Robocop".<br /><br />The movie stars Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, Ronny Cox and a few character actors you'll recognize from TV and other films. In this story, set in the near-future, Schwarzenegger plays an unassuming construction worker, married to Stone, who is fascinated with the Martian colonies of his time. His "wife", Stone, hates Mars and tries to discourage him from thinking about it...but an ad for a "memory implant service" called "Rekall" on the ad monitors in the futuristic subway compel him to visit it for a virtual vacation to Mars as a secret agent.<br /><br />Douglas Quaid's, (Arnold's character's,) life immediately changes, as it's soon discovered that his marriage to Stone is a sham, that he has another persona, Hauser, that works for the vulgar, power hungry, robber baron ruler of Mars, Vilos Cohaagen, as a very dirty agent with a wicked sense of humor and a smarmy pesonality. He's chased by Michael Ironside and his crew all over Mars as he tries to determine just what has been done to him and what he is being used for.<br /><br />In a twist, a representative from "Rekall" visits him in the middle of all this and tries to tell him that if he doesn't come out of his induced fantasy now, he may become irrevocably altered by it. Quaid doesn't believe this, however, and after seeing a betraying sweat bead drip down the supposedly "virtual" rep's temple, he shoots him.<br /><br />Stone, playing Quaid's faux wife, Laurie, was also "brought up to Mars" by the rep to convince Quaid/Hauser that everything he has experienced before was a part of his Rekall fantasy. She ends up getting into a hand to hand battle with him after she runs into Ticotin, a rebel fighting Laurie's employer, Cohaagen, in a corridor, and he ends up shooting Laurie!<br /><br />Along the way, there are dangers from decompression from urban dome damage from the pursuit of Quaid, exposure to mutants, an adventure with a crooked, black mutant cab driver working for Cohaagen and the meeting with the old "flame" of his, named Melina, (Ticotin,) who is working for the rebels that are fighting Cohaagen for control of Mars and better living conditions on the colonized world. This is all curiously offset by a recurring and ultimately prophetic dream that Arnie keeps having of he and Ticotin being caught ouside the domes of Mars without helmets. There are quite a lot of robotics used in the film...betcha it'll take you a while to determine where it's being used....<br /><br />The story has more twists, turns, O. Henrys and vagaries than "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold", but in the end, a very good thing comes of it, but I won't spoil it for you here.<br /><br />Be warned that this movie is VERY violent,(GRUESOME in parts, even!) and is full of foul language issuing from every mouth with a substantial or walk-on part. However, it has to be one of the most enjoyable sci-fi action flicks ever made, so I highy recommend this film for mature minds who can weather dialogue and violence that almost earned it an "X" rating! The theme and incidental music, composed by Jerry Goldsmith, is fantastic, btw!</p></body></html>

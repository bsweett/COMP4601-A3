Her impersonation of a dumb silent star(modeled after Judy Holliday who turned the part down because she felt it was  too small) is one of the great parts in movie history.<br /><br />The story is alarmingly thin and only an excuse for a singing or dancing number("It`s morning - yes and what a looooooooooooovely morning.... SINGING; "Good Morning.... " to name 1 of many incidents)...<br /><br />The numbers are the best from MGM, Kelly, Donald O`Connor but works only as an excuse for showing off. However, the transition-scenes from silent to sound, the preview and the finale are treasured moments - but again - thanks to Jean Hagen.</p></body></html>

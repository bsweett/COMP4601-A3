<meta name="summary" content="Downey and Rourke back in top form!"></head><body><p>I like this one more than the first. Everything was already set up in the first movie, so with this.one we get to jump right in to Iron Man. Mickey Rourke makes a great villian and he has been in some great movies here lately. The wrestler was a great movie. Downey has been making a hell of a come back to. Check this one out, then go see avengers!</p></body></html>

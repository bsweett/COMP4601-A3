<meta name="summary" content="A little long...but...."></head><body><p>When this movie first came out...I knew that I wanted to watch it, but only as a rental...having watched this latest installment by great director Ridley Scott,who is infamous for his movies lasting more than the usual hour and a half..this one clocks in at 2 and a half hours, which I had to stop and start, was a great movie...very great number of battle scenes, but there is a story line in there too...very interesting subject matter...something that should not be missed...but beware, if you are squimish in anyway, and cannot stand blood or gore, do not watch this one...Great job by all involved....:)</p></body></html>

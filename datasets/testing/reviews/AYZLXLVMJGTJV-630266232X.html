<meta name="summary" content="Some kind of Magic!"></head><body><p>The movie has magic woven in it. The way it was filmed looked sumptuous even in black and white. I am not sure why the film got to me so much except that it seemed so mysterious that the main charzcter had been dead for almost half the movie and that comes back to life. It just struck a chord in me and when the handsome Dana Andrews seems to be having a date with the dead woman also intrigued me, a different storyline than other films. I think the best thing was the acting, of course everybody loved Clifton Webb and Vincent Price. And I to liked the way Price acted in the film with his ever so slight Kentucky accent and smooth manners! It was more Gene Tierney who caught my imagination. Why, I am not sure except I liked the slow way she moved and talked. I am not even sure it that is what I want to say, she just had a charisma about her. The way she acted like a little child that needed protecting and than like a nurturing mother, it really made alot of the movie for me. I can't really place it bit I definately felt like she fit the part for Laura. I never saw her in any other movies but I think I will check out some more that she acted in. A note of interest, she suffered from emotional problems in her thirties and underwent shock therapy for depression. How sad! This is a must see for anyone interested in film noir. <p>Lisa Nary</p></body></html>

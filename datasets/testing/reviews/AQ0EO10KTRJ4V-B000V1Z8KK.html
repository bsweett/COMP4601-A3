<meta name="summary" content="Well Done"></head><body><p>Well done film.<br />Kind of combines elements of "ABSOLUTE POWER" and "BOURNE SUPREMACY" into a single film.<br /><br />Is good to see a film that draws a clear line between good and evil, unlike the wishy washy "everything in the world is grey" message Hollywood tends to send these days.<br /><br />What prevents 5 stars ?<br />I suppose it is to be expected with Danny Glover involved in the project, but in an attempt to explain the crookedness of world governments in general, they take a few overly obvious stabs at US President Bush that seem a bit forced and contrived and awkward.<br /><br />Hollywood.... unless you are making true documentaries, keep your politics and propaganda at home !</p></body></html>

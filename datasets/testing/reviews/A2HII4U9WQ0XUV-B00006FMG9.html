<meta name="summary" content="Once more, with feeling---& Anthony Hopkins!"></head><body><p>I'm not at all opposed to a good remake of a classic film, but I believe it should have something new to say, something that makes it relevant to the modern age and time.  Almost a shot-for-shot remake of the original and woefully underrated classic "Manhunter", "Red Dragon" fails on this score, and lacks the tortuous internal struggle of its detective and the trancelike, music-video pacing that made the original so creepy, poetic, and melodic.  <p>"Red Dragon" comes across as a bloodless, boring, dispirited, dreary, and mechanical cloning of the first film, directed by Michael Mann, which told the same story back in 1986 with style, wit, horror, and cinematic aplomb. Trouble is, Anthony Hopkins hadn't signed on to the role as society psychiatrist-turned-serial-killer Hannibal Lecter at the time, and Hollywood didn't have two massively successful Hannibal Lecter movies under its belt to capitalize on.  The solution: remake "Manhunter", this time casting Hopkins as the cannibalistic Lecter.<p>"Red Dragon" introduces Hannibal Lecter by way of Will Graham (Edward Norton), an FBI profiler brought back to work on the case of a new serial killer nicknamed "The Tooth Fairy" by a yellow journalist (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) at the National Tattler. Graham, nearly killed by Lecter, needs help in tracking and identifying the killer, and, like Clarisse Starling in 'Silence', visits the good doctor to get a 'scent for the hunt'. <p>There are some slight alterations, none of them for the better. Where "Manhunter" was about the internal voyage of the troubled Graham into the soul and mind of a serial killer, "Red Dragon" is Hannibal Lecter's movie. The first scene of the movie, which replaces the far eerier flashlight introduction to the Tooth Fairy in "Manhunter", is an account of Will Graham's near fatal encounter with Lecter. The scene is amusing, well-paced, and akin to the baroque sensibilities of Ridley Scott's "Hannibal", and earns the one star I've offered in this review; the viewer would do well to cut off the movie at this point and go watch "Manhunter." <p>In every comparison with Michael Mann's original, the movie falls far short; having seen "Manhunter" and watching this workmanlike copy is like looking at your uncle's yellowed polaroid of the Mona Lisa, after having seen the original on display. The treatment of the villain in "Red Dragon" is similarly flawed; the Tooth Fairy is introduced too soon, Ralph Fiennes (who does a competent job with what little he is given) is unable to evoke the bestial Dolarhyde, and even one of the film's horrific centerpieces, the flaming-wheelchair scene, comes off as a disinterested photocopy of the horrifying original. <p>Gone is the mounting suspense of Graham's troubling inner journey into his own wounded psyche and his terrifying relationship with Lecter; in its place we have Norton's complacent banter with a visibly mellowed Anthony Hopkins, who manages to make a cannibalistic serial killer look like a purring, content kitten. Gone too is Mann's use of contemporary music to evoke the Lecter's nihilistic universe and Graham's tortured one; notable in its absence is the modern equivalent of Iron Butterfly's 'Anna Gada Da Vida', used to startling effect in the original to make the culminating sequence of that movie approach Italian grand opera. <p>What do we have in place of all this? A clumsy, contrived 'explanation' for the Tooth Fairy's depravity, a psychosexually abusive relationship with his dead mother that could have been lifted directly from "Psycho." <p>"Red Dragon" is a technically competent movie, and to those viewers unfamiliar with the cinematic source material Rattner has pillaged it might serve as 2+ hours of pleasingly bland serial killer fare. But the viewer is best served to go out and buy "Manhunter" for a glimpse of true horror and a better perspective into the mind of a psychopath; "Red Dragon" is tapwater to "Manhunter's" chianti.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A lot better than expected!"></head><body><p>I guess, like many people, I was unsure about watching a movie about music and set in the 70's.  I am too young to know anything about the 70's, and as the film mostly deals with teenagers, it would appear that it has no market.  Don't let that fool you, as this is one of the best movies of the year!<br />It features star performances from Fugit as the young reporter and from McDormand as his mother.  It's also nice to see Fairuza Balk, such a greatly underrated actress.  The only remotely bad thing I could say about this movie is that Kate Hudson is not nearly as good as I had expected her to be.  She was still very good, just not as superb as I had been led to believe.<br />Basically, although 'Almost Famous' deals with teens, it is far from your typical teen movie.  It raises questions of freedom and restriction alongside the failure of modern music to truly inspire any of us anymore (or that was the message I got anyway).  As William the young reporter leaves his home in hope of freedom, friendship and rock and roll, he slowly realises that this very world he's looking is being destroyed by the people he admires, attempting to overglorify themselves though... reporters.  In short, he's never truly "free", restricted by his own emotions for the beautiful Penny Lane.<br />This is a gorgeous film and one that everyone should see.</p></body></html>

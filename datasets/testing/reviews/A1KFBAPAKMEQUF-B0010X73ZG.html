<meta name="summary" content="Two Enthusiastic Thumbs Way Up"></head><body><p>If you loved Alien or Aliens, you will love this movie.  Some characters were a bit over the top, but the movie had it all - a little comedy (some really quirky characters, such as the Bible lady), a little sadness (some of the major characters end up dying), and a lot of edge-of-your-seat drama (very thrilling scenes of humans vs. alien creatures).<br /><br />The ending was shattering, but very realistic.  All in all, I would have given it a 5 if it had toned down the swearing.  One of the best movies I have seen period.</p></body></html>

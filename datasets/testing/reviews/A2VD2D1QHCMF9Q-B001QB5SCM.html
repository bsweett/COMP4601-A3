<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyable film!"></head><body><p>This is a pleasant movie.  It starts off with a self-absorbed younger sister ruining just about every thing and every one she comes in contact with.  The older sister is responsible, hard working, sensitive, and has a poor self image.<br /><br />The re-acquaintance with a long lost grandmother brings the sisters balance and success in their lives. It also gives the grandmother some peace, which was missing from her life for decades.<br /><br />Although the film is predictable, it has humor and pathos, and leaves you with a good feeling.  Nothing very deep, but it is enjoyable.</p></body></html>

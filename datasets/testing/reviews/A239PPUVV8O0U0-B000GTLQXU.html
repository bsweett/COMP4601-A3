<meta name="summary" content="I Barely Survived This"></head><body><p>The original, with its enaging human emotions and riveting action, was a huge success, is now a classic and is considered one of, if not the best, of the disaster genre. Knowing the only reason Warner Bros. would even bother remaking it, this was a sinker (no pun intended). I didn't care who died and who lived. In fact I wanted everyone to die, there being no human connection for me to even see them survive. When they cut back to Fergie and the captain right before the ball room floods, I hadn't seen them (though minor players anyway) in so long, I thought they were dead already. All the characters are brushed over and after fifteen minutes, the wave hits the ship. While Elena (or however you spell her name) does have good motivation to survive, that motivation is revealed to late into the movie so I'm not that phased when she dies. I have a sinking feeling that, while good actors in other films, Kurt Russell (his sacrifice didn't move me at all compared to Gene Hackman's) and Richard Dryefuss only did this one for the paycheck. The one character that wished would die throughout the whole picture was the little boy. He annoyed the crap out of me to the point where ever time he talked, I said "Shut up kid!" I know in the original there was a kid, but he was actually useful and was the one who suggested the go to the engine room. The music is dull and listless and we are pained to endure not one, but TWO songs by Fergie. All in all, a very disappointing film which makes the sequel to the original feel like Gone with the Wind. Here's hoping they don't intend to remake The Towering Inferno.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perry Mason Without the Courtroom"></head><body><p>Director Paul McGuigan's films can sometimes be quite interesting.  In the medieval thriller "The Reckoning," he follows a troupe of actors who solve a brutal mystery.  In "Gangster No. 1," he follows a brutal crime rampage.  In "Wicker Park," he had editing so complex that it was difficult to understand what was happening when or why we should care.  "Lucky # Slevin" wasn't as good as the first two nor as bad as WPark, so somewhere in the middle.  The film is shot well with an outstanding cast.  However, the screenplay comes across like a Perry Mason without the courtroom where it takes the last 15 minutes of the film to unravel the plot.<br /><br />Josh Hartnett has yet to be recognized for deep acting ability.  He's been described as having a combination of good looks & puppy dog eyes.  He was the star of McGuigan's "Wicker Park"; so this is at least the second pairing of this star & director.  In "The Black Dahlia," Hartnett came across a little more deeply; although in "Sin City" & "Pearl Harbor," mostly he looks nice.  In this film, he's willing to parade around in a bath towel for what seemed like a half-hour.  His work is okay, but not exceptional.  He's like a male model in a movie.  As Slevin, he certainly masks any depth that is later revealed.  At best, this makes the ending come as a surprise; at worst, it makes the ending seem unbelievable.<br /><br />Lucy Liu broke through in Ally McBeal and has proceeded to make a name for herself in films with "Domino," "Payback," "Charlie's Angels" & "Kill Bill."  As Lindsay the coroner who lives across the hall, it's hard to judge whether she's just a simple neighbor wishing to help or somehow involved in a more complex plot.  Somehow, we expect her to be more complex than she winds up being, which is a bit of a letdown.  As a love interest, she & Hartnett seem like the odd couple.<br /><br />Mr. Die Hard Bruce Willis plays Mr. Goodkat, the assassin with a soft spot.  He's as nice of a guy as you could ever wish for to go around killing people.<br /><br />Two Oscar winners make up the supporting cast.  Morgan Freeman who brought home gold for "Million Dollar Baby" after three previous nominations ("The Shawshank Redemption," "Street Smart" & "Driving Miss Daisy") plays the Boss.  We think he's in charge, except for the flashback which clues us otherwise.  Ben Kingsley who won the Oscar for "Ghandi" (& also had 3 nominations for "Bugsy," "Sexy Beast," & "House of Sand & Fog") plays Schlomo who heads the rival crime syndicate.  After killing each other's kids, they meet their demise at the hand of mean puppy dog Hartnett.<br /><br />The film works as an interesting and complex plot that becomes clear only at the end.  The film doesn't work because Bruce Willis who can convincingly be mean is nice, while Hartnett who is nice plays mean.  Revenge occurs as Slevin falls in love.  Emotionally, this film doesn't hang together.  There is no apparent moral to the film other than revenge is okay if it's taken out against really bad badguys.  I bought the DVD without having seen the film before and liked watching some of the deleted scenes.  However, this one may be headed for a garage sale in the near future.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

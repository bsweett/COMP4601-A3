<meta name="summary" content="Artsy-fartsy War Movie!"></head><body><p>Having seen a hell of alot of war movies in my time, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is by far my favourite. It is the most engaging look at the Vietnam war, in a simplistic Kubrick kind of way.  Who else could make an  &quot;artsy-fartsy&quot; war movie.  Don't get me wrong, i'm not really a  Kubrick fanatic (the only other movie I like by him is The Shining). What i  enjoyed about Full Metal Jacket was the sheer minimalistic way it was  filmed. The scenes were not clutered about, and there were no long drawn  out mega-shoot outs where you don't know what the heck is going on.  Instead, Kubrick took his time with each scene, which in essence totally  envelops you and makes the last war sequence a total gut wretching  experience.  A total enthralling movie, and absolutely great  cinematography.</p></body></html>

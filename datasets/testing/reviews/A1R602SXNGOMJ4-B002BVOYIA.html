<meta name="summary" content="A Must See!"></head><body><p>The film is one of the most gritty, intense,factual dramas in the past few years.  The Rwanda Crisis in 1994 was a horrific atrocity, but it must be made known to the world. Many people don't know about politics and Africa and other troubled nations throughout the globe.  It would have been easy for the crew to give a one-sided tale about the horror of war and fill a 90 minute picture with nothing but blood and guts. It would have been easy to "shame the world" by painting a picture of a negligent international community who has larger concerns than the Rwandan people.<br /><br />But the crew of this film put together a film that will resonate for many years. It involved politics, culture, family, religion, race, and many other questions of ethics. It told the WHOLE story from all perspectives and made you see the HUMANITY.<br /><br />This film is a must see for anyone who claims oppression or has an interest in international affairs. It was almost like watching a documentary. This was a real event, with real people, and real consequences. If more people knew about these atrocities maybe something could be done.<br /><br />While comparisons can be made to Schindler's List, I think that this film goes further to show that events like the Holocaust can happen any time -- even now -- so long as people look away, just as the UN did in Rwanda. It certainly makes one think about how easy it is for us to forget our history and allow it to be repeated</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="COMPELLING...INTRIGUING...MOODY..."></head><body><p>This is a fast-paced, clever thriller that focuses on two men, a contract killer named Vincent, effectively played by a gray-haired and grizzled Ton Cruise, and an everyman, a cabdriver with a dream named Max,  played with appropriate resignation, intelligence, and angst by Jamie Foxx. When Vincent gets into Max's cab, neither of their lives will ever be the same.<br /><br />Max's night starts off auspiciously enough, when he drives a pretty federal prosecutor named Annie to her office, and, since they hit it off,  she gives Max her card. Unfortunately for Max, Vincent, a former special forces guy turned contract killer, is his next fare.  Vincent, claiming that he is some sort of out-of-town real estate entrepreneur, hires Max to chauffer him around for the night. Vincent explains to Max that he needs to make five quick stops, and for this he will pay Vincent six hundred dollars. Of course, unbeknownst to Max, each of those quick stops is scheduled so that Vincent can dispatch someone to the great beyond.<br /><br />By a twist of fate, the first stop goes wrong, when the contracted kill flies out the window and lands dead as a door nail on top of Max's taxi. The cat is out of the bag, as Max quickly discerns that Vincent is up to no good. Unfortunately, there is little Max can do about it other than to drive on with Vincent. Through their driving around together and their ensuing conversation, a moody character study of these two men develops. Of course, there is also a great deal of action whenever they are out of the cab.<br /><br />While some of the moments in the film are seemingly incredible, if the viewer suspends disbelief and goes with the flow, all will be well. Under Michael Mann's deft direction, the film stays taut and sharp,  with Cruise and Foxx both turning in excellent performances. Foxx can definitely run with the big boys. The supporting cast, Mark Rufalo as Fanning, a member of LAPD who suspects what is going on, and Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, the federal prosecutor, also do their bit to contribute to the tension and action throughout the film.  Overall, this is an intriguing and compelling action thriller that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gag a minute...."></head><body><p>If this movie got any funnier, it would be illegal! This is one of a small brace of movies, written by former gag writers for "Your Show of Shows", that kind of "rifled" the jokes and sight gags at you! Mel Brooks, for some reason, (I wonder what it is,) was VERY fond of poking fun at German culture, and you give him a trite teutonic subject to parody and the venom never stopped!!<br /><br />"My grandfather's work was DOO-DOO!!"<br /><br />"I ain't got no boooody, and nobody cares for me! Ha-ta-chee-cha-hat-ta-chee-cha!"<br /><br />"Pardon me, boy...is this the Transylvania Station?" "Ja, track 29....can I give you a shine?"<br /><br />Then there's the "Putting On The Ritz" number with the monster!I'm telling you, you give any jewish comedian named Mel a platform to work from, and I GUARANTEE you at least ONE comic classic! And this is one of THREE for Brooks! The black and white cinematography is first rate and this film has been called "....One of the most beautifully photographed comedies ever made!" by more than one reviewer.<br /><br />Brooks was certainly at the top of his game here, but unfortuately, after this movie, he started into a long, slow decline and hasn't rebounded since, (except for "Life Stinks" and "History Of The World", MAYBE!) so enjoy this movie, for it's the last of its kind from a director that used to DEFINE truly screwball comedies!</p></body></html>

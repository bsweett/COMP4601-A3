<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, and not the worst entry in the series, but not as good as you'd hope."></head><body><p>When I heard that Christian Bale was starring in the newest TERMINATOR film, I flipped.  I mean, Bale's portrayal of Batman (or, rather, Bruce Wayne; I have qualms about his Batman voice, but that's another rant) helped rejuvenate the ailing franchise...hell, it brought it back from the grave.  I figured he could do the same for TERMINATOR as well, a series that started strong, became excellent, and then fizzled in the third entry.<br /><br />Well...SALVATION is much stronger than TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES.  However, Bale isn't given much to work with--his character, John Connor, wasn't even the principle character in the original script.  SALVATION rests squarely on the broad shoulders of Sam Worthington, who thankfully is an actor worthy of the challenge.  Worthington plays Marcus Wright, a death-row inmate given a second chance as one of SkyNet's failed human/cyborg composites.  However, the film wavers between Bale and Worthington's characters, primarily because the studio knows that ignoring a big-name star like Christian Bale is a big no-no.  Dare I say it: this movie would have been stronger without Bale's presence.  (I know, it's almost blasphemous; but it's the truth.)<br /><br />Also along for the ride is the talented Anton Yelchin (who also hit 2009 blockbuster gold in STAR TREK), as the guy who eventually goes back in time and sleeps with Connor's mother (look for voice cameos by Linda Hamilton).  We've also got a grossly under-used Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Ironside; Moon Bloodgood, who's a good fit for the role, although again there's not much to work with; and Bryce Dallas Howard, who doesn't quite mesh with the action stars she's surrounded with.  Add to that McG's uneven direction, and TERMINATOR: SALVATION comes off as another "what it should have been" film--not great, not spectacular, but entertaining enough to make up for RISE OF THE MACHINES.  Of course, that wouldn't take very much.  Also, let's face it: we would've loved a genuine Arnold cameo, his old age be damned.  Now THAT would have been true salvation.</p></body></html>

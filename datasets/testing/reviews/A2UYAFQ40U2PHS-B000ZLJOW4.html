<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful film, intelligent, surprisingly compassionate, and humanistic..."></head><body><p>This is a great, great movie.  It could have easily gone off into another variation of the typical indie film.  Instead of being smug and overly quirky like many indie films can be, this film is genuine, intelligent, and humanistic as well.  I atttribute this to the director, Terry Zwigoff, who directed one of my favorite documentaries, Crumb, and the two excellent leads, Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch.  Buscemi here is especially good, playing a character that could have easily turned into a caricature with a lesser director and actor.  Buscemi plays a lonely 42 year old bachelor who lives with an astonishing record collection.  Some may have portrayed him with snark and made him look like a loser, but Buscemi and Zwigoff give him humanity and soul, and it makes for one of Buscemi's greatest performances.  He's really underrated as an actor.  Birch is excellent, too, as the sarcastic, yet human girl who takes a liking to Buscemi.  Again, their romance feels real, and she seems to genuinely like him, despite the differences in age.  It's not forced, sleazy, and it's not done for the sake of being quirky.  This is one of the best indie films I've ever seen.</p></body></html>

This story of the life cycle of the Emperor penguins is beautifully photographed, accompanied by a lavish score, and quietly narrated by Morgan Freeman. I can't imagine how the film was made, as I'd understood humans just cannot be exposed to the cold of the Antartic winter (mounted cameras?)The cinematography is stunning--there are times when the penguins on screen look like an abstract painting, with the beautiful curving neck, white/black motif, and stunning slash of orange near the face. This is a beauty. It may be a tiny bit slow for some kids, as there are long pauses when the cameras just feast on the beauty of these birds--but for adults it's a winner.</p></body></html>

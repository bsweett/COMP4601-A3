Surprise!"></head><body><p>This new version of The Pink Panther didn't fare well in the reviewer columns when it was first released.  Being a fan of the Peter Sellers versions, I didn't exactly boycott this movie.  I just told myself that I didn't want to see a corruption of the original.  Well, that changed when it came out on DVD, and was discounted to boot.<br /><br />This version of The Pink Panther was also entertaining.<br /><br />Steve Martin was a very passable Inspector Clouseau, Kevin Kline was okay as the Chief Inspector, and Jean Reno was a great reinterpretation of Clouseau's sidekick.  Funny, funny throughout!<br /><br />One thing that couldn't be changed, and wasn't, was the music.  It couldn't have been a Pink Panther movie without the Theme from Pink Panther!</p></body></html>

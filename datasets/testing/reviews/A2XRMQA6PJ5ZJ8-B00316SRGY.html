Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War veteran who, after seeing combat in Korea, worked on the Ford assembly lines until he retired.  His particular neighborhood has slowly become predominately Vietnamese, and this culture at first neither appeals to him any more than his new neighbors understand him.  Slowly, however, each side comes to appreciate the virtues of the other and therein lies a humorous but also poignant storyline.  Clint Eastwood turns in his usual stellar job as the grouchy, politically-incorrect "Walt".  The big surprise here is that the mostly unknown Vietnamese cast is extremely good and they turn in excellent performances as well.<br /><br />There are some ethnic slurs in this film and normally I do not approve of such.  Perhaps the film could have dispensed with this, but who am I to second-guess Clint Eastwood?  In my opinion this film may be forgiven that, because in the context of this film it is a legitimate device to bring the viewer to the ultimate message of the film, which is one of mutual respect and ultimately, friendship.

<meta name="summary" content="The Future is so bright, he has to wear shades! Watched it over a dozen times - still great! Dystopian future at it's best."></head><body><p>This movie is set approximately 30 years after nuclear war devastates the planet. Unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KMB6VE">Babylon A.D. [Blu-ray</a>], the United States did not recover. While viewing the movie, I often think that it's very similar to the games "Fallout" and "Badlands" - the future is indeed bleak.<br /><br />People compare it to other Dystopian movies - Mad Max and the like. Well, all post-apocalyptic Dystopian movies will share many similarities, from the dust-shrouded sky to dead vegetation, wandering gangs to small outposts run by the strongest and best armed. "The Book of Eli" does a better job than most. The environment is fantastic and believable, the de-evolution of society and technology dead-on. All colors are muted, almost sepia toned. Everything is gritty and dirty. Shampoo is worth it's weight in gold.<br /><br />If you enjoy this genre (post "we killed 'em all, let God sort them out) and low-tech survivalist flicks, then this will not disappoint. It was much better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IWRE3I">The Road (2009)</a> - in story, plot, characters and effects.<br /><br />We don't see crumbling skylines - until the end. We don't explore dead cities. We join Eli at the end of a decades-long journey, and see a glimpse of the possible future.  I could have done without the religious rhetoric and Oldman's character (Carnegie) believing that the book is the answer to everything and the source of all power. Denzel Washington gave a surprisingly good performance outside his "comfort zone", and the sexy Mila Kunis was a believable supporting character. The cast had plenty of other well known actors, from Jennifer Beals to Ray Stevenson, plus a decent supporting cast.<br /><br />Every character was well cast and acted - none seemed out of place (think Matt Le Blanc in "Lost in Space" or John Wayne as Genghis Khan).<br /><br />This is one of those movies I'll watch when I can't think of something else (along with the Resident Evil series!)</p></body></html>

Yet, because the list is not yet long enough to stretch back more than one generation, it is inevitable that the film be compared to TOY STORY I & II, INCREDIBLES, SHREK, ICE AGE, MONSTERS INC, FINDING NEMO, ROBOTS, etc. etc. This may not be entirely fair (it's not like we compare a film like UNFORGIVEN to every western ever made)...but it's true nonetheless. Upon leaving the theatre, my first thoughts were, "well, it's better than SHARK'S TALE and ROBOTS and ICE AGE II...but isn't up there with RATATOUILLE and SHREK either." I should be judging it on its own terms. So I'll try to do that.<br /><br />This is a fairly standard "sports underdog" movie in many ways. The hapless Panda, voiced by Jack Black, is clumsy, overweight and hardly built to excel in Kung Fu, a sport / art form which he knows inside-out (as a mega-fan would). Yet, when a serious threat to his town is unleashed, a wise old turtle comes to believe that this Panda may be "the dragon warrior" of legend, the "one" who can save them all.<br /><br />Panda thinks this idea is pretty ridiculous, BUT it gives him a chance to hang out with some of his heroes, true Kung-Fu artists such as Tiger (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Cricket, Snake, etc. He relishes being with them, and even blows off most of their insults and mockery.<br /><br />But his "master" (Dustin Hoffman, doing a really nice job here) is compelled to train Panda, even though he thinks it is a waste of time. What do YOU think? Will Panda find new talents in himself that he never suspected he had? Will he earn the respect of his heroes? Will he save the town?<br /><br />I won't answer these questions here...but suffice it to say that you know the answers to these questions before the movie even starts. This is a film where the journey to the answers is the key.<br /><br />The journey is amusing enough. The Chinese village is rendered lovingly, hinting at the feeling of watercolor painting, yet staying true to the almost 3D style of the best CGI films. There is no question the movie looks great. Within these settings, the journey unfolds with funny scenes showing the clumsy Panda attempting Kung Fu. Yes, there's even a training montage.<br /><br />In fact, the plot is so predictable that the film would be thoroughly tedious were it not for the relationship between master and student. Black's Panda is a nice creation...he's funny & smart, and while he feels overmatched physically, he doesn't actually seem to think there's anything wrong with that. He gets down on himself at times...but is remarkably resilient. Essentially, even if his self-confidence is low (he knows he is not likely to be a pure Kung Fu genius) his self-ESTEEM is always high. Hoffman's master is a bundle of energy and aggravation, and makes a nice foil.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the other characters were so minor. While I don't watch movies like this for the actors behind the voices, I had expected the Kung Fu heroes to be more a part of things, and to add more dynamics. In fact, they were pretty minor.<br /><br />The climactic scenes were not as exciting as I would have liked, either. So in the end, the film was a mixture of amusing and creative bits, covered by a layer of predictability. KUNG FU PANDA, no matter how great it looked, could not throw off the unoriginality of story.<br /><br />I believe kids will like it, and I wasn't exactly bored myself. But whereas TOY STORY and MONSTERS INC have warranted repeat viewings over the years, KUNG FU PANDA will probably NOT earn a space on my movie shelf.</p></body></html>

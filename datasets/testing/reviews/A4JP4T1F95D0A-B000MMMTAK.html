I had heard reviews from people that loved it, and some who hated it, so I watched this one expecting something decent, but not great.  This is a very un-PC movie.  To many it seems crude and vulgar, but it is much more than that.  A lot of the people who dislike this movie don't get things like South Park, which are over the top, but are really terrific satires.  Borat is a funny movie.  Sacha deserves the riches he made from this movie just for the nude wrestling scene alone.  I would never have done that in a million years.  I would rent this one if you are not sure if it is to your tastes.  For anyone else, this is a must buy.</p></body></html>

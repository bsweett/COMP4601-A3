<meta name="summary" content="Jarmusch fans will love it."></head><body><p>Bill Murray continues his middle-aged sad sack routine with this movie, his face affixed with a consistently deadpanned, hang-dog expression worthy of Buster Keaton. After this film, his shtick feels played out. Murray has explored just about every variation and nuance possible for this particular type of character and kind of performance. His acting in Broken Flowers mirrors director Jim Jarmusch's laid-back direction perfectly.<br /><br />The always reliable Jeffrey Wright is excellent as Winston who does all the leg work and pushes his friend to solve this mystery. He is the proactive counterpart to Don's reluctant protagonist - a hallmark of Jarmusch's films. In typical fashion of all of the director's movies, Broken Flowers is an understated comedy and this is evident in the way Winston and interacts with his family - they clearly love each other but Jarmusch doesn't hit us over the head with it.<br /><br />Broken Flowers most closely resembles Jarmusch's Stranger than Paradise with its long, static takes and deals with a protagonist's inertia. Don is an aging Don Juan, a bit of a sad sack stuck in rut with no direction in his life and the anonymous letter he gets in the mail motivates him into action. Or rather, he stumbles into an adventure. A large weight of regret hangs over Don and this overshadows his entire journey. True Jarmusch devotees are wondering throughout if this film will be open-ended a la Down by Law or have some kind of closure like Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai. Ultimately, Broken Flowers is about a journey that forces Don to re-examine his life and his relationships with the women in it.<br /><br />"Girls on the Bus" features more footage of the terminally chatty teenage girls that Don encounters on a bus.<br /><br />"Broken Flowers: Start to Finish" is an amusing outtakes reel that takes us through the entire movie.<br /><br />"Farm House" features behind-the-scenes footage with Jarmusch talking in voiceover about the random nature of life and how he likes to have scenes in his movies where you don't know what's going to happen next.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></body></html>

Which is to say, some movies need to be seen on the big screen because when you rent them, they seem a lot less significant than in the theatre (see my review of Kate Winslet's &quot;Titanic&quot; for another entry in this category). <p>So that's part of the reason I cannot give it 5 stars. The other reason is that the film goes off on a major tangent when we learn about the Young People's love affair. Time to get out your scissors and edit it yourself to keep the momentum going.  <p>All that being said, I enjoyed &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; much more than I ever thought I would. I was curious to see it solely because it was directed by Ang Lee, who did such admirable work with &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, a great favorite of mine. When I tried to organize an outing among my friends, I was met with great resistance because they wouldn't see an Asian movie or a martial arts film starring nobody they ever heard of. The two people most inclined to go declined as they had actually seen it already, but applauded my wishing to see it, as they enjoyed it. So in the end, I went with three people who were more interested in the promised Mexican dinner afterwards. EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED to FIND THEY LOVED IT! Yes, it was effectively acted and superbly filmed in breathtaking outdoor locations. Art direction first rate. And the fighting was choreographed in a balletic style which was utterly graceful. The much-talked about flying sequences gave the movie a fairy-tale feeling, like something out of the Arabian nights. And, except for that trip to the Young People's Love Affair, the story line was very good. I was surprised to see that it was really a Women's Picture, with most of the fighting concerning them and the storyline featuring them almost to the exclusion of the male characters.<p>So, I would recommend &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; heartily to folks who think they never could, ever would like a martial arts movie. There's a lot more hidden than just the dragon!</p></body></html>

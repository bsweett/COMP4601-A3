<meta name="summary" content="SHARP SAW"></head><body><p>This is the first and as far as im concerned the best of the Saw movies.  This movie is very original and the ways the writter has Jigsaw torture these people is cool and very disturbing.  Personally, I didn't see the twist at the end coming and was blown away, I think that is why this is my favorite of the Saw series.  Highly recommending, but be forewarned; it's demented.</p></body></html>

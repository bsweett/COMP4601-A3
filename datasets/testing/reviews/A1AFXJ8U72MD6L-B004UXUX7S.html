It won a number of lesser known awards so I'm not kidding when I tell you the critics loved it.<br /><br />So what's it about? Focus on Hawaii and a guy named Matt (Clooney) who runs a steady real estate law practice and is also the executor for a huge chunk of land worth millions to developers. It has been in the family for generations (hence the title) and most of Matt's relatives want to sell the land and make millions. Matt is going along with it but part of him wonders if they're doing a disservice to later generations in the family.<br /><br />But the real catalyst is when Matt's wife has a major boating accident and is in the hospital with a coma and Matt believes she is going to come out of it and then the doctor tells him it isn't going to happen and he needs to tell the whole family that she will be dead soon. That's when the poignant moments come into this movie which are most likely the major reason it was so well received by the critics. Add to that a dysfunctional family with secrets and you start to see everything unravel but you also get these strange moments where you can't help laughing or maybe laughing but still feeling their pain. At one point Matt tells his eldest daughter that their mother isn't going to make it (he does it clumsily at best) and the daughter submerges into the pool holding her breathe and the camera spends an inordinate amount of time focused on her facial grief. She comes up out of the pool and starts to walk away from her father not wanting to share her pain with a family member you would think she would want to do so with but that just reinforces the dysfunctional actions of this family.<br /><br />Minor spoiler coming up so stop reading if you want to go in totally blind and already know you will see this picture. Matt's eldest daughter, who is at that difficult teenager/young adult transition, tells him that his wife was cheating on him with some real estate agent (she doesn't known his name or location). As to be expected this sends Matt into an emotional meltdown and you get to see him in this undignified moment in which he's running in his boat shoes down a road to confront the best friend of his wife to find out who the cheater is and where he lives. What follows is a journey with his two daughters and a guy friend of the eldest named Sid to confront the real estate man but to also come to terms with their grief, unsaid words to the mother/wife in a coma and their overall place in the universe. This is a definite soul searching movie on several levels. People who watch this casually and don't appreciate the poignant moments will wonder what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Sid is arguably and surprisingly the closest echo character to Matt. There are a few moments of clarity in which they have these revealing conversations. That said, he's kind of an insensitive jerk at times so I enjoyed it when he got face punched by Matt's father-in-law. The eldest daughter lashes out in her rage at times, especially towards what her mother has done to the family, and the youngest daughter knows something is wrong so she goes off into dramatic situations to get attention.<br /><br />Themes about forgiveness versus vengeance when your spouse cheats on you are obvious. What type of person would you be and the film suggests you really do not know until it happens. Additionally, there's a definite thematic focus on how weird family can sometimes get with large sums of money as well as how a family can still be a family even though it's noticeably dysfunction (if the psychological stats are correct well over half of American families are dysfunctional).<br /><br />Based on a novel of the same name by  Kaui Hart Hemmings. The budget for this film was $20M and it made a bit over $82M at the Box Office. Clooney's performance, subtle at times, pumps up the quality of this picture.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; SCENERY: B plus; THEMES/FOCUSES: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.</p></body></html>

I started off watching this movie expecting to be bored for the next 3 hours of my life, but surpringly, I'm glad to say that I was wrong. Brad Pitt as Achilles makes this entire movie worth watching anyway, but the fact that he totally kicked @ss was an added bonus. Not only is he extremely HOTT!, but he can also pull off playing a Greek legend like a charm. Quite frankly, I haven't seen Brad carry a movie this great in quite some time, so I am most certainly impressed. I also must admit that I underestimated Eric Bana's character "Hector" as well because he actually played a great warrior. I was also shocked to see Peter O'Toole because he's definitely a face that I haven't seen in a long time, and he still looks great for his age might I add. I can honestly say that the only character that I was a little diappointed with was Orlando Bloom's character "Paris". It's a good thing that he had so many other stronger characters supporting his role because clearly he was just the weak link of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Orlando Bloom, I really do, but his character just wasn't in the same league as the others. To keep it short, I would definitely recommend that anyone who hasn't seen this movie check it out, and then buy it for your collection. I know I plan to.</p></body></html>

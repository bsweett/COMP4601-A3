<meta name="summary" content="On its own, Planet Terror was the better half..but something is obviously missing"></head><body><p>I had the pleasure of seeing Grindhouse the way it was meant to be seen and in a theature it was meant to be seen in - the Alamo Drafthouse - with real grindhouse trailers playing as preshow entertainment.  The whole thing amounted to a great theatrical experience - one that hasn't been able to be replicated on video - here in the US at least.<br /><br />So we are left with two seperate releases.  Planet Terror fares better on its own.  Even though its left without its partner in crime, its still an homage to the old Grindhouse flicks.  It exploits the over top horror, stylized shots, and campiness of those films.  It does one better by having a higher quality and because unlike those films, which mustered up cheap shots in order to get tickets sold, the creator is out to deliver a fun film.  Rose Macgowan gets a gun for a leg!  Freddy Rodriguez is really good with guns!  And just wait til you see what happens to special effects expert Tom Savini!<br /><br />Still, on its own, there are some issues.  Notably, the film is almost too long.  The "exteneded and unrated" notification is to be taken almost as a warning.  A lot of the so called "unrated" scenes, were cut for pacing.  They don't add anything really.  A sad testament to this was Robert Rodriguez's commentary, as he states several times that scenes were cut for good reasons.  Still, this is a fun film.  However, if you can't wait for the inevitable proper cut in the US on DVD, have some dinero and a multiregion DVD player, Grindhouse can be experienced properly via the 6 disc editon available at Amazon's Japanese site.</p></body></html>

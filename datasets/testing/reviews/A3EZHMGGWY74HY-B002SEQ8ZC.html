<meta name="summary" content="Mixed feelings on this one"></head><body><p>We loved Corpse Bride, also Nightmare Before Christmas, so I thought this might be a similar style movie and that we would enjoy it too, however, I can't say that the experience was entirely positive.  A six year old watched with me, once movie was over, she said she didn't like it.  I asked why...she said she didn't like the "Mom with the Button Eyes."  FYI: Maybe it's too much for a six year old.<br /><br />I think the reason I wasn't over impressed is that I really loved the book (Neil has written some books that I'm crazy about!) and I think this was a let down to the Coraline I had in my mind as I read his book.  Isn't that the way it usually goes?  If you read the book first, no movie can compare.<br /><br />If you are still determined to try this one, go ahead, because it was not what I would call a complete bust.  It's nicely done, just not living up to the book in my eyes.</p></body></html>

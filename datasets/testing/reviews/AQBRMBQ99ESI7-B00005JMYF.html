<meta name="summary" content="A Mindless but Fun Comedy"></head><body><p>Peter owns and operates a neighborhood gym. He is a nice guy but a lousy business man. In fact, he is practically broke. Still, his is the only place accessible to the "average Joe". It does not cater to the "beautiful people". Frankly, it caters to losers. They are nice losers but losers all the same.<br /><br />The problem occurs when a big, corporate gym wants to buy his facility. He doesn't want to sell but does not have the cash to pay off the delinquent note. The only hope is to enter a dodgeball tournament. Nobody from the gym really knows anything about dodgeball but it is their only hope. They are lucky in that they find a former "professional" to act as coach. As predictable as it seems, the underdogs manage to triumph after a lot of unexpected traumas along the way.<br /><br />This film is utterly predictable and uses all the traditional sports clich&eacute;s but that does not matter because it is fun. Enjoy it for what it is: a mindless but fun comedy.</p></body></html>

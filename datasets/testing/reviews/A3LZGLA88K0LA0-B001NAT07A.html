Granted, CATWOMAN is not a work of cinematic genius, nor is Halle Berry ever going to live down the fact that she made this movie after winning an Oscar.  But as far as lightweight, implausible entertainment, CATWOMAN's not really all that horrible.  It sometimes seems more like an episode of TV BATMAN, with its droll humorless humor, and it's tongue in cheek.  Just watching Berry sashay around on rooftops with that tremendous swing on her back porch is enough to classify this as camp entertainment.  Berry is joined by Benjamin Bratt as her cop boyfriend, and the delighftully catty Sharon Stone as the villainess.  It's really no worse than THE CROW or FANTASTIC FOUR; I think it got such bad reviews because we expect more from Berry?  Oh, well, I'm in the minority and that's purrrfectly okay with me.</p></body></html>

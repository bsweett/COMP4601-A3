'Kung-hu' is a comedy, sure it is, but the star/director Chow takes this martial arts very seriously, and the film itself gives more emphasis upon martial arts actions (including silly ones) than the parodies or sight gags.  And look, the film is credited with TWO choreographers -- Sammo Hung and Yuen Wo Ping!<br /><br />[THE STORY] is set in pre-Revolutiona China.  The city is ruled by ruthless mobsters 'Axe Gang,' and now remember, they are really ruthless.  Even though they dance like 'Cotton Club'-Meets-'Gangs of New York' style.  And of course, they wield axes while dancing in the street.<br /><br />Then our hero Sing (Chow) enters.  He wants to join in the 'Axe Gangs,' and to prove his 'ability' as gangster (whatever it is), he tries to extort money from the locals living in the 'Pig Sty Alley.'  What he didn't know was, the people are much, much more strong and resourceful than he expected.<br /><br />The plot may sound rather pointless, and in fact it is.  In short, it is about two wannabe gangsters, and the fights between gangsters and the residents of the 'Alley.'  You see several references to other films, but the film's greatest merit is not them.  It is kung-hu action.<br /><br />[ACTIONS] For Stephen Chow shows unexpectedly exciting fight sequences between the unique characters -- assassins who use musical instruments like invisible swords (and this scene is very violent), the tailor and cook who fight like devil, the Landlord and Landlady, and The Beast ... yes, he fight like a beast, or a toad (literally).<br /><br />[THE STAR] Stephen Chow as hero Sing displays considerable martial arts skills, especially in the finaly act which goes like the climax of 'Matrix Revolutions' -- and Chow is better than Keanu! -- but it is the extraordinary supporting actors that really are rivetting.  The hen-pecked landlord by Yuen Wah (known as 'magnificient villain' in Hong Kong films) and his chain-smoking wife landlady by Yuen Qiu (coming back to screen after almost 30 years) are real scene stealer, always surprising us with their outrageous personalities.  And wait for 'The Beast' by Leung Siu Lung (himself a major Kung-hu star during the 70s, and comes back to movie after 15 year hietus) whose initial appearance as a bald and plump middle-aged is very deceptive.  And look for Yeun Cheung-Yan (as a suspicious-looking seller of 'kung-hu manuals'), brother to Yuen Woo Ping and action choreographer of 'Charlie's Angles.'<br /><br />The film may not as funny (and silly) as 'Shaolin Soccer' and if so, that's because Stephen Chow really respects the art of kung-hu and its masters.  It is still a comedy, and it is often funny, but perhaps you should see it as an action film -- with ridiculously exaggerated fight styles based on the traditional kung-hu.  So, my advice: Don't think, just feel, and enjoy yourself.</p></body></html>

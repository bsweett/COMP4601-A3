I believe that its important to know their names, where they came from, and who they were because we all need to know the loss in order to make sure it doesn't happen again, and their legacies live on in our perseverance. I thought it was time, 5 years after, to begin showing what happened either in TV or in films. The story of Flight 93, the plane that crashed in Shanksville Pennsylvania presumably on its way to hit the White House, is riveting because of the details of both its passengers and crew and the detective work it took to piece together all those details. The planes that hit the world trade centers and the pentagon gave us few glimpses as to what transpired onboard, we have very few first hand accounts to see into their last moments. There were two projects based on that day, this movie "United 93" put out by Universal and a TV movie called "Flight 93" which came on A&E 3 months before the theatrical release. I have watched both, and I prefer the A&E version over this one, now this one is well done and is visually stunning and hits you where it should, BUT the TV version in my opinion has the greatest impact emotionally, physically. United 93, tells more of the technical side, what was happening on the ground at the military and aviation centers, It does not go into the passengers and their personal struggles and their families heartache. On Flight 93 we see everything the technical, the military, the passengers, the hijackers, the families. Watching the people call their families, which is taken directly from records and interviews, broke my heart in two. Knowing these heroes through this glimpse into their final goodbyes, and seeing them rise up to confront the terrorists inspired me like no other movie ever has. United 93 didn't quite live up to that, I felt like they didn't show who these people were and what they were leaving behind. If I hadn't watched the other one, it would have been an amazing movie, I am still giving it 5 stars, it deserves it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Movie! One of the Year's Best!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best movies of the year. Not only does it have a heartfelt story, but it is visually amazing. The other computer generated image movies that came out this year were "Shrek 2" and "The Incredibles." The difference between the three movies is that "The Polar Express" took of picture of Tom Hanks, who plays about five different parts, and then they animated the picture of it. The people characters all look realistic, and the movie could give the impression of a life action film. What I love about animation is that you can do anything, and this movie creates it's own world. It reminded me of "The Wizard of Oz." Instead of a girl, it was a boy, and he enters a magic land full of new adventures and new friends. "The Polar Express" is also based on a children's book of the same name. I never read the book, or heard of it before the movie came out, but I heard that the movie is as good as the book. It is hard to make a movie version of a 40 page book, and alot of people were disappointed with the movie version of "The Cat in the Hat." I'll have to look in the store for this book and flip through it there. Tom Hanks is having a very good year, with "The Ladykillers" and "The Terminal" all getting five stars from me. I just wanted to take in all of this animation, and enter this world, and I haven't been so impressed with animation since last years "Finding Nemo." I'm just looking forward for the next technological leap in animation.<br /><br />The movie begins with the young Hero Boy sleeping in his bed, waiting for Santa. He is at that age where he is beginning to doubt if Santa is real or not. As he is lying in bed, a train pulls up in front of the house, and The Conductor asks if he is coming on board. Hesitating, the boy gets on and meets the Hero Girl, and the Know It All. Know It All is that kind of kid where everything that he says sounds like he thinks he is better than everybody else. He probably doesn't mean it, but he gives that impression. They are going to the North Pole, for it is Christmas Eve, and on the way, after picking up young Billy, they go through many adventures, including riding on ice, going down Glaciar Gulp, which is the steepest mountain in the North Pole, and finally making it to the North Pole. Along the way, the Hero Boy also meets the Hobo who lives on the top of the train, who is a ghost that whenever he disappears, one of his hands always lingers. When they make it to the North Pole, it's not all smooth sailing, and they meet the elves, who run a very tight organized layout, and get to see the Christmas Eve ceremony.<br /><br />"The Polar Express" is always entertaining, and you can't take your eyes off the screen. I have to compare it to "The Incredibles" because that is the other big animated movie of the season. "The Polar Express" is Rated G, as opposed to the PG that "The Incredibles" has, but this movie is much more darker. There is not a bright tropical island, with the little boy fighting other super villians, instead it is a much more sober tale about believing. The Hero Boy doesn't really believe, and I loved the way to believe. The Boy doesn't get all the perks that everybody else does. For example, he can't hear the sleigh bells, because he doesn't really believe that they are there. He believes he is in a dream for a short period of time. I found this movie to be more entertaining than "The Incredibles" and much more visually stunning, even though I gave both movies five stars. Tom Hanks played the voice over of the Hero Boy, The Hobo, The Conductor, The Boy's father, and even Santa Claus himself. This is the best Christmas movie of the year as well, and beats "Surviving Christmas" and "Christmas with the Kranks" combined. I wanted to thank every person in the credits personally. The slight thing I didn't like was when Hero Girl and Billy had to sing that sappy Christmas song. It did slow the movie down a little, kind of like "If I Were the King of the Forest" in "The Wizard of Oz." It broke the mood of the story, and if that was cut I wouldn't have minded.<br /><br />I saw "The Polar Express" twice. I saw it on opening day on the regular screen, and then I decided to see it on IMAX, otherwise I would have reviewed this already. I recommend the IMAX version more. It is on a much bigger screen, and it is in 3D. It was like riding a roller coaster, and I was able to study the animation more clearly with the crystal clear screens. I don't wear my glasses often, but I can see that the 3D glasses were much more bigger to cover the glasses as well. It was great seeing some of my favorite scenes on the IMAX, including the journey of the train ticket over mountain, and in a birds nest, and especially the train riding on the ice, I won't say anymore. I loved the music of the movie, as well, and it provded such a sweet and sad undertone, which touches the heart of the movie. I wanted to cry during the very last line of the movie, both times I saw it. It's very happy, but subtitling sad, and it was then when I knew that "The Polar Express" would be close to the top of the Best of 2004.<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated G</p></body></html>

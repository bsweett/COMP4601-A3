First I must say I found the title somewhat misleading as I fully expected it to be another slasher flick, but it's actually a psychological thriller with a dash of satire.<br /><br />Christian Bale, as Patrick Bateman, gives a striking performance as a young, wealthy Wall Street yuppie, representing corporate America in the 1980's, where he and his peers are obsessed with getting into the trendiest restaurants and which of them possess the finest business cards. They all have the same haircut and wear the same business suits, rendering them nearly interchangeable and making for frequent cases of mistaken identity.<br /><br />Bateman, whose idea of foreplay is pontificating on the merits of his favorite 1980's songs, is disgusted with his fellow man's lust for material status and conformity. Lacking emotion, he acts on impulse and murders co-workers and clueless prostitutes while maintaining the facade of shallow, materialistic conformity. Unfortunately, the shallow lifestyle is the very thing that leaves him feeling empty inside and provokes the killings.<br /><br />The conclusion of the film leaves it to the audience to determine whether Bateman actually murdered anyone or if he merely fantasized the killings. Perhaps it was yet another case of mistaken identity, one which allowed Bateman to get away with murder. Of course American Psycho II (which I saw before part one) answers the question of whether or not he was a murderer. The movie was violent, but not as much of the book. However, I think blood and gore would have taken away from the overall satire of the film by turning it into a campy horror movie. The film had a not-so-clear subtext: The absurdity of the killer's actions and motives equal that of the rich, corporate, snob's. Directed by a woman, American Psycho is a thought-provoking study of the inner workings of a dark and twisted mind. It's a good one to watch especially for the price that Amazon is placing it for.</p></body></html>

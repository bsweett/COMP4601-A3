<meta name="summary" content="Satisfying Blu Ray"></head><body><p>I admit it's been such a long time since I've seen the Breakfast Club that it felt a lot like the first time when I watched this on the recent Blu Ray release, so I really can't compare it to the DVD release or any others.  I can say, however, that I was very pleased with the picture quality.<br /><br />Fans know this movie has a very basic storyline, and very few scene changes.  But nonetheless, you still get a juicy taste of 1080p while watching it.  Facial closeups look crystal clear and gorgeous, while the background has fantastic depth.  This is particularly vivid during the ending speeches.  The depth is so perfect you have that great 3D feel that makes Blu Ray fans giddy.<br /><br />As far as grain and flickers are concerned, I didn't see any.  I may not be as picky as some HD scholars, but I was actively trying to look for any signs of a bad transfer nothing caught my immediate attention.<br /><br />My only complaint about this release, as is my complaint with just about every Universal release, is that the loading time is a little ridiculous.  I'm not sure if it's their main menu template or what, but all my Universal blus take ages to load.<br /><br />Overall, if you've never seen this movie you really ought to watch it.  Many try to make intelligent high school movies, but very few succeed.  The Breakfast Club is one of the lucky few.  It's heartfelt, it's emotional, it's well acted, directed, and written.  Its stood the test of time (25 years!) but thanks to blu ray, you can now watch it and feel like you're viewing a new release because of the perfect clarity.  Even if you have seen it a 1000 times, however, I'm willing to bet its worth the DVD upgrade.  Any chance you can get to increase the pixels of beautiful Molly Ringwald is worth it, IMO.</p></body></html>

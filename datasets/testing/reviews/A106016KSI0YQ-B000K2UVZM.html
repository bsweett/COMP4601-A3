Bizarrely, the true stories of the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short (Mia Kershner), her murder, and the reaction to it wind up getting the least attention of the plot's many strands: you wind up feeling as if its the annoying bother everyone wishes were out of the way rather than the original story's raison d'etre (and the selling point of the film). Instead we are given full attention to the uninteresting erotic triangle of the two detectives investigating the case (Aaron Eckhardt and Josh Hartnett) and the blonde they both love (Scarlett Johansson), which is far too much anyway like the central dynamic of the three main characters in LA CONFIDENTIAL, a film also based on another novel by Ellroy. Things are not helped by the acting of the main characters: though Johansson comes off best of the three, she doesn't have nearly enough to do, and Hartnett seems a handsome ghost (as always) and Eckhardt, always a capable actor, is more of a character actor than a star and doesn't have the required presence for his role. Hilary Swank, who is on the other hand, indubitably a star, is bizarrely miscast as the Dahlia's  supposed "lookalike" friend, even though she looks absolutely nothing like either Mia Kershner or the real Elizabeth Short. She seems to be whooping it up with her outlandish role and affects for it what Charles Busch has called "American theatrical received pronuniciation"; the producers would have been better off casting him in Swank's role. There are a few nicely executed sequences by Brian de Palma (including two of his signature sequences where several different things happen in one small space at once on many levels vertical, horizontal, and diagonal), and the cinematography deserved its Oscar nomination, but those caveats can't hide the fact that this film is really a bummer. Don't try to get too attached to figuring out whodunnit: the mystery's resolution is absurdly and inadequately explained away in about fifteen seconds by the killer in the most ridiculous scene in the entire film.</p></body></html>

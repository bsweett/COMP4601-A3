Witherspoon is truly astounding in her role as June Carter and Phoenix is just grand in his portrayal of the man in black. This is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen period and it ranks up their with favorites such as The English Patient and Restoration. The singing (yes they do sing live) is almost to good to be true and Phoenix has been able not just to portray Johnny Cash. He has emulated everything about him and sometimes you forget that you are watching a movie and you start to think that you are seeing something real. The same is true with Witherspoons portrayal of June Carter and one can safely bet that she is an A list actor and will not be doing anymore movies like legally blond 2 anymore.</p></body></html>

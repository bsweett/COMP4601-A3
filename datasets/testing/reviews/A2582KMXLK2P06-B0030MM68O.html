<meta name="summary" content="realistic?  nah, but good"></head><body><p>The Hurt Locker is what I consider a step in a different direction compared to most war flicks.  First of all it's nice to see a movie set in a desert environment instead of the jungle lands of Vietnam (a war that's been well documented by this point).  That in itself is a nice refreshing change, and I believe we will continue to see more desert-themed war films in the future thanks to both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars of the last several years.<br /><br />No doubt in my mind the reason a (supposed) realistic storyline pertaining to the war in Iraq was created in the first place resulting in the Hurt Locker being released is because of all the Americans and British who sit here day in and day out wondering exactly what's going on over there.  I find out through reading some reviews here on amazon that the film isn't really that realistic though which is unfortunate.<br /><br />What's most appealing about the Hurt Locker is the way it continuously keeps the audience guessing exactly when the explosions and gun bursts from the sneaky Iraqi enemies will occur.  They almost never happen during the times you THINK they will, and that alone is quite surprising.  The one exception is the man who had bombs wrapped around his chest and waist.  Yeah, you just knew he didn't have a lot of time left.<br /><br />As far as the acting goes, well truth be told I've seen better.  It mainly sticks to a few select soldiers who are not necessarily buddies, but they gradually win over each others respect by frequently putting themselves in harms way and setting a mood filled with tension and fear.  They always look out for each other and live dangerously, that's for sure.  Respect is certainly earned as a result.<br /><br />Overall, yeah, perhaps it could have been shortered by about 30-45 minutes, but I honestly wasn't bored at all.  A great film.</p></body></html>

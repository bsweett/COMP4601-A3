<meta name="summary" content="Great bargain for four really good movies"></head><body><p>At first, I received the packaging that had two, double-sided DVD's.  I had to return them because two of the movies got to a certain chapter in the movie and then stopped, no matter what DVD player or computer I tried to use.  Amazon was wonderfully simple to do a return, and I had my replacement in two days.  There must have been a manufacturing error with the first one, because the second shipment came as four single-sided DVD's and they all played perfectly.  I did not see these movies in the theater, and the heavily censored and edited TV versions are hopeless.  It was really great to see these movies as they were originally meant to be seen.  At this price, to get four quality movies is a real deal.</p></body></html>

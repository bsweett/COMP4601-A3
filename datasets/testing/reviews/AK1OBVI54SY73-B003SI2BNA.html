<meta name="summary" content="Average and Nothing Special"></head><body><p>Especially in the first hour or so I felt like I instead got the wrong DVD and was watching a drama that was seriously boring, for I do find most dramas boring. The lead actress whines and whines throughout this movie and it really got annoying, not to mention that the storyline never became too good and the ending was so typical. The whole movie was pretty typical and never was I jolted out of my seat or even surprised for one moment. This movie was dull- possibly because the storyline I feel is very familiar to other films I have seen- which it is.<br /><br />The acting itself is not too strong and the whole movie feels just like a combination of a bunch of other films I have seen. The whole story is boring and not bold at all or fresh in idea. I very much disliked this film and I highly recommend another horror film. This movie is just not worth watching to me. My friends only thought it was okay and it was just that- average and nothing special. Try looking for another horror movie first before trying this one is my best advice.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Good, The Bad & The Elephant Seals ..."></head><body><p>The good:<br /><br />I really liked the overall story of the plight of the penguin. The outcast going on the odyssey and then returning home with a hero's welcome.<br /><br />Children **really** love this movie.<br /><br />The music was well done and many very nice, but not too overplayed hits were threaded delicately into the soundtrack. I would've loved to have heard more than just a few bars of K.D. Lang's version of 'Golden Slumbers', but I guess that's what the soundtrack is for.<br /><br />I thought Robin Williams did good work as Ramon here. I will revisit his contribution in the next section as well.<br /><br />This movie had a very subtle message of conservation that wasn't preachy or contrived.<br /><br />It was funny to listen to the King of Steampunk voice the King of Rock n' Roll. I think his penguin Elvis definitely breaks new ground with with old ideas about the King's voice.<br /><br />Steve Irwin would've loved this movie.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />I felt the scene that's added in the extras titled: 'Mumble meets a Blue Whale' should've been added into the film for all the reasons that the introduction to the clip stated. I found it odd that Robin Williams could have multiple parts in a film but it was a bit much to have the seagull version of Steve Irwin doing a parody of himself which was very touching. The scene with the elephant seals was dull and difficult to pick out the dialogue. Steve Irwin should've been given his moment in this as this may have bee the last major motion picture that he was attached to.<br /><br />Robin Williams having two very large parts within the film was not just disconcerting but off-putting. While I did like the character of Ramon, I couldn't get around the thought that Williams was probably taking bread off the table of another actor. Cedric the Entertainer comes to mind as well as Bernie Mac. I think Bernie would've been fantastic in the role of Lovelace and it even seems written for him.<br /><br />Also, while we're meant to rightly assume that the narrator is Lovelace, the narration is almost a role in itself as you're left guessing which character it is because he has multiple speaking parts. So chalking up three jobs seems very much over the top.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I really enjoyed the film and think most others will as well. The points I make are minor ones that the bulk of children wouldn't even give two shakes about. My thoughts about Robin Williams role in this has been repeated quite a bit in many of the other reviews. It looks very good in HD / Blu-Ray as well.<br /><br />... ...</p></body></html>

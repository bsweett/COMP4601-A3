The scene where Ferrel is singing (spreading christmas cheer) is priceless. I was in tears! It is a silly but fun movie. Will Ferrel stars as Buddy, a human orphan raised as an elf in Santa's workshop, grows up in the land of Rankin-Bass Christmas TV specials. Candy cane trees, gingerbread houses and an animated talking snowman are this boy's life. His odyssey to find his biological father, a cynical publisher on Santa's naughty list, takes him out of the land of sugar plum diets and into the bustling streets of New York City. He meets dad, dad thinks he's a nut, takes him in, other son befriends him, dad get's mad at buddy after buddy innocently mistakened a midget for an elf (yet another gut burster) and says some unkind words, son finds buddy, santa crashes in central park, and they all help santa and save christmas. Now that I just ruined the movioe for you, you should still see it. It's no A Christmas Story, but it is a fun and enjoyably silly comedy for the whole family to enjoy.</p></body></html>

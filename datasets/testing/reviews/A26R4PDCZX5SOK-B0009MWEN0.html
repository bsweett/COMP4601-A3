It is a unique story with great characters and well produced. This is a really fun sci-fi movie to watch. Great special effects and a nice future look. As always, my only complaint is why send ground troops with under-powered weapons to attack the "bugs" without air support? Oh, well. I do recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

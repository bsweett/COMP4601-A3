I saw it in the theater when I was in college and bought it when it was released to video. I know that a lot of people complained that Michelle and Harrison had little to no chemistry, and I agree! However, they were married a long time, and there were "serious" issues there. I thought the plot was great, and I stayed interested until the end. I've watched it many times, and think it's a great mystery/thriller.</p></body></html>

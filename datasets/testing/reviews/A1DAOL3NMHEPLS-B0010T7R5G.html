<meta name="summary" content="Would make a great double feature with &quot;The Truman Show&quot;"></head><body><p>This is a near-great movie, with fantastic production values and decent acting.  What keeps it from being among the truly greats is its somewhat trite mind-control storyline. The consensus rating of 4.5 stars is about right; l gave it five because Amazon does not allow half-star ratings. <p>&quot;Dark City&quot; would make a great double-feature with &quot;The Truman Show,&quot; also released in 1998.  Both movies deal with manipulated realities, and Dark City's Shell Beach, which John Murdoch is so eager to find, is a dead ringer for the idealized town that Truman Burbank is trying to escape from! <p>PS: Amazon's listing for &quot;Dark City&quot; notes that people who bought it also bought 12 Monkeys, Donnie Darko and Blade Runner.  I am one of those people (I own all three, although I didn't buy them from Amazon) and &quot;Dark City&quot; is definitely in the same general quadrant!</p></body></html>

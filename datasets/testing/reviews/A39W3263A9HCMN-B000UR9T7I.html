<meta name="summary" content="This spider ran out of silk..."></head><body><p>I LOVE the Spider Man first two movies, but I am sorry to report that this isn't very good. And here's why:<br /><br />1. Peter in this movie was not very likeable. He is totally emo, and way predatory when he is in touch with his dark side.<br /><br />2. More than half the movie is WAY too depressing. WTF is with MJ being a total bitch and breaking up with Peter, Peter being depressed for more than half the movie, Aunt May's boring relationship adivce, Peter being consumed by his so-called "Dark Side", and everything being grey??????? Sorry, but that doesn't help the movie. And it doesn't fit in with Spider Man.<br /><br />3. WAY too many characters, most of which are under-characterized and unbelieveable; Venom is pretty much non-existent until the final fight, Eddie Brock has NO place whatsoever, and Sandman is whiny and emo for basically the whole movie.<br /><br />4. The Director is trying to cram way too many things into the movie; way too many charactors, too litle time. there aren't enough fight scenes and when there are, they are lame and only last for practically 1 minute. The reason that the other movies were good was because whilst explaining itself, they still cut the BS and got straight to the action.<br /><br />5. The Fight scenes are lame and totally forgettable, the special effects are awful and yet cartoony, I.E. When the building is almost destroyed.<br /><br />6. WAAAAAAAAY too long!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Overall this was way dissapointing, and as soon as you see the Jazz club scene, you know what else to expect...<br /><br />This is not a good movie folks, sorry.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Suspenseful"></head><body><p>This movie was suspenseful, a fugitive quality movie. Harrison Ford was great and never seems to age. I like the selection of actors and the scene dynamics. The Action, music, and acting were suspenseful.<br /><br />Plot: Jack is head of computer security, at a local bank in Seattle with 27 branches and an airtight security system. Jack misdirects hackers by leading them to false accounts. The thieves realize they can't penetrate the system, so seek an inside job.<br /><br />Identity theft occurs and Jack is accused of Internet gambling fraud of $95,000.<br /><br />Jack wrote the banking software and understands the security systems. Jack and Henry are involved in merger takes with a large bank with over $200 million dollars in assets. A theft and his five-team (impersonating pizza delivery) kidnap Jacks family and force him to steal $100 millions deliverable to five Cayman offshore accounts. Sarah, the daughter, asks one of the thieves," why do you hate us" and he replies, "Sarah, I don't hate you - I just don't care about you." After the death of the first thief, Beth starts working on convincing the remaining thieves that Cox will not let them live because he wants all the money for himself. The thieves don't seem persuaded by her comments, with the exception of one, but he does little to aid in their escape.<br /><br />Cox is cruel. He purposefully causes the little boy, Andrew to go into an allergic seizure, after feeding a cookie with nuts. Jack must beg for the medication. At that point Jack decides he must steal the money.<br /><br />The thieves like the Cayman accounts for its low income tax. Jack uses an ipod and fax scanner input to record maintenance screen images of accounts and then uses optical character recognition to reverse the images into text for upload into the thieves' databases. The thieves have a way to setup accounts in the Cayman Islands.<br /><br />Jack fires his secretary. Jack uses Bills PDA to take a picture of wire account; he uses to transfer the $100 million dollars. Later, Jack tells his secretary, he was forced to fire her by thieves, and they need Bill's pda. Bill has been chasing the secretary and leaving flowers and inviting her to religious revivals. Jack uses the wire account to reverse the $100 million back into the bank, believing he will protect his family. Cox has plans to kill the family and takes them to a remote house near a lake. Jack uses the dogs GPS tracking system to local the family and rescue them. Jack saves the bank and his family.<br /><br />It is unclear, if Henry was involved in theft. Cox discloses to Jack that they were inside already at the time of introduction. Cox had control of Jacks computer when he tries to send a emergency email. Henry tells Cox, he can't believe the deal is happening. What deal is Henry excited about.<br /><br />Jack discovered encrypted files under the name "cox". Henry was the person who introduced Cox to Jack. Cox introduces himself as an entrepreneur.<br /><br />After Cox obtains the electronic money, he frames Jack for the murder of Henry. The plot was Henry was having an affair with Jack's wife, Beth, and Jack kills Henry in Jealous rages after Jack discovers the affair. Jack then was to disappear and the thieves escape with their money.<br /><br />However, Jack is hiding at the time of Henry murder by Cox, and kills the thief assigned to kill him. Jack reverses the action by taking back the thieves money by wire transfer and tracks down Cox.<br /><br />Cox himself kills two his team and Jack kills three (one with a food mixture and the other by automobile) and one in a fight. Cox and Jack remain, and it's a one on one fight between the two, with Cox dying by gruesome means.</p></body></html>

Four middle-aged, weekend riders decide to take a cross-country road trip.  You know when Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy are together it'll be a good laugh!  They encounter a biker group that apparently doesn't like "posers".  There are cameo appearances by the father and son bike builders from Orange County Choppers---Paul Teutul and Paul Teutul, Jr.  What a lot of people missed is the who played the character, Damien Blade, owner of the bar that Travolta burned down---it's Peter Fonda!  Reminiscent of Easy Rider! Come on! They had to put him in just for that connection!  Anyways, if you ride like I do, you would understand the road trip and the free feeling, just getting on your bike.  This film puts a little more fun and outrageous motorcycling into it!  Just enjoy the ride, it's worth seeing!</p></body></html>

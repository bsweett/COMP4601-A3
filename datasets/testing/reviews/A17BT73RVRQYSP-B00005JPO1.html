<meta name="summary" content="'Tis not fun tis nostalgia"></head><body><p>Harrison Ford still has it, Karen Allen still has it but apparently George Lucas and Speilberg doesn't.<br /><br />The plot is pretty loose the Soviets after a great weapon hidden away in a wooden box in a forgotten warehouse. And although the lost ark makes a brief cameo we are instead looking for the contents of area 54.<br /><br />Of course the plot weak as it is plays 2nd fiddle to the ongoing and never ending chase.  We are crashed, sunk, buried, chased and made to dodge the Bomb.  Because the characters are ones we care about it adds to the moments but they seem recycled.  Those moments are great fun but stringing them together do not a great movie make.<br /><br />In the first and 3rd movie the stakes are made clear early, an great battle between good and evil with the world at stake.  Hollywood today being what it is they can't quite bring themselves to make that clear connection when the foes are Communists until very deep in the movie and even then not without the obligatory early "Red Scare" scenes to suggest moral equivalence.  Cate Blanchette's performance doesn't help matters, she is as wooden a character as we have ever seen but I suspect a lot of that is due to the writing.  The presence of Marian seems to preclude any kind of relationship or bond forming between Blanchette and Ford (although it did't have to) so instead she becomes a stock villian.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong there are stunning visuals, great stunts, good comedy and Shia LeBouf does a much better job than the critics give him credit for but like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1903654297">Dr Who Audio Twin CD Loups Garoux (Doctor Who)</a> for the Big Finish Dr. Who audios or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8QVBK">Marx Bros.: Go West/The Big Store</a> for the Marx Brothers it is an avg entry in a quality franchise.<br /><br />Still you can't have the whole collection without it and it is enjoyable.  The best way to describe it is like a scene in an old comic book I once had. The JLA finds themself in an alternate universe and when the 40's Superman expresses satisfaction at fighting the Nazi's Green Arrow Comments "Lets not spoil the man of steel's fun."  Dr. Fate replies "Tis not fun tis nostalgia".  Well the movie is a bit fun but its appeal is largely due to nostalgia.<br /><br />This isn't a bad choice for a movie but Prince Caspin is a better one.</p></body></html>

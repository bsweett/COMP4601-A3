On the outside they exude confidence, style, and success, and they know exactly what to say and when to say it.  But on the inside lurks a fragmented soul ready to snap at any given moment.  Welsh actor Christian Bale, in one of the best performances you will ever see, brings to life Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who works at Pierce & Pierce by day and is a serial killer by night.  In adapting the controversial and unpleasant book by Bret Easton Ellis, director Mary Harron purges much of the violence and misogyny that made the novel one of the most despised and misunderstood pieces of literature in the last 20 years.  What remains is the book's twisted sense of humor.  This isn't a slasher film but rather a clever satire on the yuppie lifestyle of the late 1980s.  Speaking in a pitch-perfect American accent that recalls a game-show host, Bale perfectly embodies his character physically and emotionally.  His performance makes you simultaneously laugh at, pity, and fear Bateman.  Jared Leto is also good in his brief role as Paul Allen (in the book it's Paul Owen; why his name is changed in the film, I don't know); Chlo? Sevigny also stands out as Patrick's timid assistant, and Reese Witherspoon shines as his clueless and self-absorbed fiancee.  This is the unedited version, which has a few additional flashes of nudity in one of the sex scenes.  The difference is so minimal, you'd hardly notice it, showing how uptight the MPAA can get when it comes to editing films.  Nonetheless, "American Psycho" is a disturbing but clever film that was one of the best of 2000.  It comes highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Looks great and often funny, but not much of a story"></head><body><p>I moderately enjoyed this but am starting to be bothered by the tendency of animators to be content with creating films that 1) have no real story and 2) are built around whatever animal characters haven't previously been used in other films.  Though other films have had lions, few or none have featured zebras, hippos, and giraffes.  I can imagine the early concept planning sessions:  "How about a gerbil?  Has anyone used them before?"  I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that they create the characters for these things first and then construct a story around them.  And that is the problem with this film:  they don't start by creating a great and compelling story.  Contrast this animated film with either of the SHREK films or THE INCREDIBLES.  The latter films have great stories.  Or going farther afield, contrast MADAGASCAR with any of the film by Hayao Miyazaki's masterpieces.  Miyazaki's films are not merely brilliantly animated; they feature magnificent stories.<br /><br />Despite not really having a story, the film is otherwise executed with the kind of panache and sheen that has become standard in the CGI-film.  The characters all look fascinating and are wonderful to look at.  Alex's mane, to cite only one example, with its hundreds of individually articulated strands of fur is stunning.  There isn't a frame in the film that isn't wonderful to gaze at.  And the voice over work and the individual jokes are marvelous to behold.  There just isn't a whole lot of story and what story there is arises from Alex's need to eat.<br /><br />My worry with the contemporary Hollywood animated film, whether CGI or hand drawn (though virtually none seem to be hand drawn these days) is that increasingly story is being neglected for the design of the look of the characters, a long string of in jokes, and the background art.  SHREK had all of these elements as well, but also featured a strong story.  So, a truly intelligent animated film clearly is still possible.  MADAGASCAR features some good characters, lots of good jokes, and looks spectacular, but it just doesn't have much of a story.  I would gladly have given up a few of the jokes for even a halfway decent story.</p></body></html>

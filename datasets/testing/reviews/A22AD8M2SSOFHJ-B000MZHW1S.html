I originally thought it was an action movie with Leonardo DiCaprio.  Although it is much more than that.  The story takes us to war strewn country of Sierra Leone where the government is trying to fend off the rebels.  Watching the movie made me realize there is really no good side.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the late 90's when people in the United States were more concerned about the Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky scandal.  There were very real problems going on in the world and that is apparent in this story.  The movie makes no excuses for the excessive violence since it was and is such a real issue in the world.  Diamond smuggling is a multi billion dollar business fed on the Western desire for the precious jewels.<br /><br />The story develops quickly with an average family living in a small village.  Their life was generally peaceful in an exploding world.  The rebels then attack the village taking no prisoners.  The battle becomes very real when you see small children with machine guns shooting at everyone.  When the dust settles the Solomon's family has escaped and he has been trapped.  Solomon is then quickly shuttled off to a diamond field to begin work searching for diamonds.  During this work Solomon comes across a diamond as large as an egg.  Surprised by this find he realizes the only thing he can do is take the diamond and hide it.<br /><br />What happens then is an amazing story filled with action and suspense.  A journey that never stops and can only takes one breath away when they realize this is something that really happened.  It is a sad story but it is also a happy story.<br /><br />I watched the Blu-ray version which was filled with a beautiful picture and wonderful sound.  It also had many extra features including a wonderful documentary about the smuggling business.  For anyone with a Blu-ray player I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best movies of the year.  With the lack of great movies this year it's great to have a diamond in the rough.  A story that is incredibly amazing and true.  Sometimes almost hard to believe this could be real.  This is a journey of how greed can lead to terrible things.  I hope if you take the time to watch this you learn something about wrongs that have occurred because of greed.  A definite must watch for anyone.</p></body></html>

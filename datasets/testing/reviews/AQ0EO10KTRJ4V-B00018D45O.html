<meta name="summary" content="Timing is Everything"></head><body><p>The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a classic largely because it was somewhat original, unique and shocking when it was first released 25 years or ao ago.. much like the original Dawn of the Dead ushered in Zombies, TCM introduced us to the modern concept of horror/slasher films.<p>Of course over the years, hundreds if not thousands of horror films have been made all borrowing from the TCM idea.<p>So what is wrong with this new remake ?<br />It's 25 years too late.<br />If this had been the movie we saw all those years ago it may be something special but as it exists now in 2003/2004 it sinks into the sludge pile of being just another &quot;dumb stupid teens meet Deliverance type country people&quot; film.<p>All these movies share a common trait (although nowadays the teens are usually at some cottage in the woods 90% of the time)......... the teens are always so stupid you don't care about them and actually are kind of glad to see them get killed.<p>Think about it... if you need to escape danger from a house... how hard is it really ?<br />These dumb kids keep running in circles around the house so they keep running headlong into leatherface and family.<p>Worse yet they toss in a little &quot;tribute&quot; to Blair Witch Project at the end of this movie.... UGHHH.... Blair Witch... that's a whole other story in terms of junky over-rated movies.</p></body></html>

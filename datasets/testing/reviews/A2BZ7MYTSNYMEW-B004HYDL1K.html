What I will say is that you will either love this movie, or hate it. I am one of those that LOVED it. Ok, you should also know that I appreciate Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), Charlie Huston (Author of Hank Thompson series), Wayne Kramer (Running Scared) and Troy Duffy (Boondock Saints). I enjoy the crime noir or pulp noir genre of crime dramas because they tend to generate heated debates and discussions. No matter how you classify them, or what side you fall on (the love or the hate side), these sort of movies produce strong feelings...either negative or positive, and I think that is what most writers and producers hope for. There were some pretty controversial issues woven throughout the story.....vigilantism, immigration, drug abuse, sex, and violence....all of which set the stage for some pretty extraordinary events.  Although the subject matter and the dialog may seem on the surface to be in poor taste and offensive, I viewed it as a vehicle to tell the story, and a very entertaining story at that.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />Day laborer Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) has been approached and hired by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to shoot Senator McLaughlin (Robert Deniro). This assassination attempt was meant to endear voters to the Senator who is running on a "strict regulations against illegal immigrants" platform. What's better than a fallen hero?  Anyway, what Booth does not realize is that Machete's past is a little more complicated than he initially realized. Machete is an ex-Federale (Special Agent) who was presumed dead after being shot in the head following a case that went terribly wrong, and even resulted in his wife being beheaded. Now living the simple life as a day laborer, Machete is associated with some very unique characters, among them Luz, a vigilante/activist whose main goal is to help those who truly need rescuing while running a taco truck. Unbeknownst to them both, they are being watched by the very tenacious, ICE Agent Santana Rivera (played by Jessica Alba) who wants to prove herself and bring in the bad guy(s). Meanwhile, Booth is restless and has his own agenda, not to mention a very unstable drug dependant daughter, April (played by Lindsay Lohan) who he has some very impure thoughts about. To complicate matters, Booth also has a relationship with Von Jackson (Don Johnson) an eager border enforcer; and Drug Lord Torrez (played by Steve Seagal), none of which will result in anything positive. Even Machete's brother, Padre Cortez (Cheech Marin) isn't immune to what is going on and finds himself in a precarious position. As the violence escalates and the story unfolds, you see an underworld that contains gun totting nurses, a patch wearing Rodriquez, hired assassins, and dirty politicians, not to mention seeing the knife wielding Machete kill several dozen people who stand in the way of vengeance or justice.<br /><br />So before passing judgment on the movie, I suggest you just give it a chance. Challenge yourself to look beyond the stereotypes, violence and other things that on the surface are disturbing, and take it for what it is....a story about wrongs being made right, and good overcoming evil. I highly recommend this movie, and think most will enjoy it.</p></body></html>

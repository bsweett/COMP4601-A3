As they say, it is better late than never. Or, in my case, it was right on time. Spending years as a care giver for my grandmother, with my mom, for well over a decade, I know well the state of our nation's health care situation - not only in terms of trips to the emergency room, but, also how support is offered (or not at all) to those in the position of either requiring care or merely offering respite to those primarily responsible.<br /><br />Michael Moore (Fahrenheit 9/11, Bowling for Columbine) presents an excellent framework for this very important film on an invaluably important topic. We see the stark realities of people in our nation of the United States - how people who have horrific injuries/accidents (example: losing a finger in a saw accident) are forced to choose WHICH finger to save because of the great cost to the patient (I am talking tens of thousands of dollars) for one digit alone!  We see how health care is being regulated in nations like France, England and Cuba. Though, the generalized message that keeps resurfacing over and over is that the United States is a waste land, in terms of patient care (that includes how insurance companies run their shady games with people who have terminal conditions (like cancer), and many have criticized him for his heroic portrayal of Cuba (yes, for some, this is still a country that the United States has no business even interacting with due to the Castro dictatorship and other factors), this film is a very important slice of life piece. We see how cold hearted the so called "caring profession" has become, as well as being preposterous and even laughable in its practices - example: charging a newborn baby for his own DELIVERY.  Many of the examples Moore presents as dysfunctional instances (that are only the tip of the ice berg) in our United States culture and the interactions between patient/client/customer, doctor/doctor's office and insurance provider leave me nothing short of speechless. Some of the accounts (presented here in interview/testimony) seemed more than a little parallel to the practices of the mafia and how they feel comfortable cutting people/connections no longer "of use" to them - politically speaking, ethically speaking. It definitely gave me a new awareness of the effect of no insurance on the lives of thousands upon thousands of people with chronic health conditions, diseases and afflictions.<br /><br />Though, on the other hand, as I see how health care practices are abroad (Europe, Cuba), I had to ask myself just how fair those depictions were/are  (as well as how accurate). I recall Moore was harshly criticized for the consistent tone throughout the piece that the United States is basically a miserable excuse for a nation, in terms of our health care practices, and how virtually every other country on this planet presented in the film is staggeringly superior and more aware of the importance of compassion, service and professionalism, as well as ethical responsibility. A perfect example is in England, when he depicts the experience of a patient in the Emergency Room/Urgent Care unit as opposed to the experience of an American in the United States, having to maneuver the system here. In that European nation, he illustrated the wait time as being smooth (almost non existent), that medication was free and the attention to the individual was perhaps most important of all. Also, he presents an instance where a young American woman defects to Canada, purely for health care purposes - even is willing to marry a Canuck to seal the deal.<br /><br />As always, Michael Moore intersperses dashes of his rollicking sense of humor with cold, hard facts about the state of global health care practices (granted, this was several years ago). I recommend you see this film for its historical merit, also for its engaging approach to storytelling.  Bravo, Mr. Moore. Bravo.</p></body></html>

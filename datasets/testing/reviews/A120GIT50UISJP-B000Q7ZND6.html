Call John Constantine [Keanu Reeves], a spiritual warrior for hire. In Constantine's world, shady dealers sell dragon's breath and holy water to people like Constantine, who can see demons in their true form, and battle them back to hell. But, chain-smoking, coughing up blood, it's not demons that are going to get him, it's lung cancer.<br /><br />Constantine isn't selfless, especially with death so close. He wants to win his way into the good graces of god, but no matter how many souls he saves, it's not enough. Or so his mentor, a half-breed angel-human, Gabriel [Tilda Swinton], tells him. Not until he stops squandering his gift (Constantine would call it a curse), and does good for the sake of doing good. But Constantine calls it unfair, and refuses to play. Gabriel has no answers for him--tormented by the demons, Constantine attempted suicide as a youth, and was dead for two minutes. For that sin, he is damned.<br /><br />The strange world Constantine lives in has become even stranger. Full demons are attacking him and others, something they are not supposed to be able to do. Half-breeds, part human, part demon or angel, can exist on our plane, but full demons and angels stay home, in hell or heaven. Constantine must find the reason for this breach of the rules before the worst of the worst cross over into our plane and consign all humanity to hell.<br /><br />Fascinating in the rich world that it creates, Constantine will keep you asking questions about good and evil, heaven and hell, and the power of humanity to choose.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hey Capt'n Crowe, are we there yet?"></head><body><p>I found it amusing that Amazon paired this with the Tom Hanks flick Cast Away for the "Best Value" - these movies are very similar in speed and action.  Way too much getting from point "A" to point "B", with little occurring once we arrive at point "B."  This is definitely a film about the journey, not the destination, ie, the fast frightening French Frigate (say that five times!)<p>Our intrepid Captain Crowe seems to be a bit behind the times in naval warfare and very slow on the uptake.  One gets the impression that he blunders his way through challenges. I was grateful for the 8x fast forward speed on my DVD player, as I was thankfully able to skip over a lot of the fluff.</p></body></html>

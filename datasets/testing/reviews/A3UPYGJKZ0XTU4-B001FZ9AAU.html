<meta name="summary" content="A Triumphant Blend of Action and Character."></head><body><p>"Iron Man" is one of the best comic book adaptations to find its way to the big screen. With sharper dialogue than "Spiderman" 1 and 2 and more irreverent energy than Tim Burton's "Batman" films, which would be its only competition, this is pure fun and a great start to a superhero franchise. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a self-absorbed playboy industrialist and wunderkind of the arms industry. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile, he is kidnapped by a militant faction who insist that he build them one of his new-fangled weapons. Assisted by the Afghani doctor (Shaun Toub) who saved his life, Stark constructs a bullet-proof, firethrowing, flying suit of armor to use in his escape instead. Upon returning to the United States, Stark finds that his priorities have changed. He plans to take Stark Industries in the direction of energy technologies, not weapons, which doesn't sit well with his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />As the first film in the franchise, "Iron Man" spends a lot of time on Stark's transformation. I never felt like the story was filler in between a bunch of overblown action sequences. The action never lasts very long. This is a good thing. It pushes the pace of the film while avoiding prolonged duels that can become tedious. I think it would be generous to call director Jon Favreau's previous work "mediocre", but I have to admit that "Iron Man" is a triumph. Favreau even successfully dealt with the challenge of making it interesting to watch someone build a machine or look at a computer screen. The key is that Stark is able to converse with his computer and make pithy comments to his robot while working. Not every actor would have been so amusing talking to himself, but Robert Downey, Jr. makes Tony Stark a lovable reformed rake. The film's only weakness is that Stark's leggy personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his military liaison Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) seem to be there only for decoration.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2008 single disc): The only bonus features on the single disc edition are 11 deleted or extended scenes and a publicity spot (1 min) for the upcoming Iron Man animated series. Plus there is a short but sweet Easter Egg (2 min) in which "Iron Man" co-creator Stan Lee talks about Robert Downey Jr. and his cameo appearance in the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish,  French. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Visually Fun Flick, But It Takes Itself Too Seriously"></head><body><p>&quot;Independence Day&quot; could have been a great film.  It's got the huge explosions that draw in big summer crowds, it's loaded with fodder for popcorn popping, but after that...<p>Honestly, this isn't a terrible movie.  It will hold your attention for the entire duration of the film.  The visuals, especially the opening sequence showing you just how tiny the moon and our little neck of the universe can be, are fantastic.  The special effects are top-notch and the acting is over-the-top, loud-mouthed and fun.  The aliens are believeable enough and I liked the touch of Roswell thrown in to give the story a little substance.<p>However, things went downhill from there.  Now if you've read my review of Emmerich's &quot;Godzilla,&quot; you already know that I liked that movie.  But the reasons I liked it are the same reasons that I'm not overly fond of &quot;Independence Day.&quot;  Like the large lizard flick, the story has no originality to it whatsoever.  It's a blatant rip-off of all those old Sunday matinee sci-fi movies.  At least &quot;Godzilla&quot; had the decency to impregnate the title character.  Tons of buildings are destroyed in both films, but &quot;Godzilla&quot; more or less just toppled things over trying to hide from the baddies.  Only Madison Square Garden received any extra special attention.  In &quot;ID4,&quot; buildings were destroyed to show people just how nifty the special effects were.  The two biggest disappointments in &quot;ID4&quot; had to be the virus implanting ending(just too unbelieveable) and Will Smith.  Normally I like Mr. Smith, but he's just too annoying in this movie.  I found myself hoping that one of the aliens would have whacked him just to shut him up.<p>In closing, I have to say that this is a fun movie to watch if you like explosions, but for some reason, this movie doesn't click with me like &quot;Godzilla&quot; did.  I know they are different films, but they were created on the same larger-than-life scale.  &quot;ID4&quot; takes itself too seriously.  It's nothing more than a glorified cheesy sci-fi movie that's fun to watch, but just not fun enough.  For a better time, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has explosions galore, including some cool bug guts.  If that's not your speed, check out &quot;Armageddon.&quot;  It has that whole &quot;end of the world&quot; thing going for it.  Both of these movies don't take themselves too serously, and they are a lot more enjoyable to watch.  If that still doesn't fit your bill, break out the old Atari and play &quot;Space Invaders.&quot;  Now that's entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bravo For Brosnan (Truly a Bonafide, NOT Bond-afied Actor)!"></head><body><p>The Matador is about an assassin who has been working for a mysterious Mr. Stick for 22 years. Julian "facilitates fatalities". He asks no questions,gets the job done, and moves on waiting for the next assignment or package while traipsing 'round the globe.Julian has no home address.He has no home.Period.Until he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico while completing an assignment and enjoying a little r&r afterwards(fiestas, siestas,bars,sex shops,matador fights)---he's done with his job early. They soon develop a most interesting male bonding friendship/relationship (nope, this ain't BrokeBack Mountain territory folks)!Let me explain. Danny Wright (Kinnear)is the average American hardworking Joe in the world of corporate sales who as the frontman for the business through  pitches tries to keep the profits and contracts coming in (can you say job security?). He has a loving devoted wife back in Denver and a warm and inviting, cozy home(not a house). He is the poster child or man for the middle to upper middle working class in America. Julian Noble is a slightly crusty, paunchy,sad and lonely, miserable burned out assassin who befriends Danny while in Mexico and vice versa. Danny embodies everything that Julian wishes he had , and , no, not the material things;things that even the blood money he's made can't buy him! The friendship between both men starts off rocky and very unlikely to succeed or continue. Julian is crude,rude, and uncouth (he doesn't give a crap or take crap---so, you would think)Yet,ironically, he possesses this intelligent worldly aura from his experiences in literally globe trotting for his job or jobs over the years.He's got a penchant for boozing it up and a strong hankering for almost every skirt that passes him by(even for the younger ones that may be unsettling for those who watch the film)! Danny is the extreme opposite of who and what Julian is.Complete antithesis. Though, Danny himself is far from perfect, has his own personal issues and is very much human(frailties, strenghts)... Let's fast forward. Julian's burn out has finally caught up with him after botching yet another job(age?conscience? change of heart? life re-evaluation? all of the above? ya think?). He's now the target of his boss!...How does Danny fit into the equation? Go see The Matador.<br /><br />The Matador is such a befitting title for this film. Literally, matador in Spanish means killer or assassin. So, there really is no "symbolic" meaning in reference to Brosnan's character Julian Noble.It's a literal translation in Spanish for the word describing his "profession" and who he is. Bet a lot of folks thought, "Oh, how exotic in comparing Brosnan's role to a Spanish or Mexican matador!". That said, I saw the film last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! It feels and plays out like an adult, mature comedy for mature audiences. If you're expecting 100 jokes and laughs a minute or anything bordering into teen humor movies, you won't get it here (except for maybe a couple of sex scenes that don't add or detract from the film) !<br /><br />Whether speculation is that Pierce Brosnan is poking fun at his former Bond glory days or not doesn't matter.Who cares ?... It's great to see him in a dark comical role (though a true-life assassin is anything BUT comical).It showed another facet to his multi-talented abilities. Nothing worse for an actor than to be typecasted over and over until it just becomes a parody of that type of said role---the suave and debonair agent or spy.His execution(no pun) of biting and sarcastic comical wit and timing was awesome. Also, the great element of comical surprise was hearing Brosnan utter both funny and filthy lines in some scenes when you least expected it(element of good surprise indeed). Brosnan and Kinnear's acting chemistry was great;The New Odd Couple of the 21st Century?Could be.  Actress Hope Davis as 'Bean'was also wisely casted as the wife of Greg Kinnear's character. I kept looking at her and thinking she reminded me of Callista Flockheart for her wholesome acting persona--- but a slightly more rounder and healthier looking Flockhart!She may have that sweet naive expression at times but she's sharper and wittier than you think. She contributes well to the overall humorous atmosphere. Greg Kinnear is, well in Greg Kinnear acting territory. The always likeable and trustworthy guy who can be so gullible at times! Again, even his humorous or comical streak works in great sync with Brosnan's!<br /><br />Keep an open mind that the premise or story is whacky, ludicrous, whatever you want to call it and you'll have a great time. Don't expect Brosnan to go completely into Billy Bob Thornton character antics (Bad Santa).Yet, don't count on Pierce to do his Bond antics either(been there, done that).There's a faint or slight  comical wit akin to his early Remington Steele days on television where even that character had a strong underlying funny bone in him at times. What The Matador does is it serves as the perfect vehicle in showcasing Brosnan's brilliant comedy acting talent with other emotional ranges as well that makes him the bonafide (not Bond-afied) actor he is; An actor who truly takes risks and succeeds flawlessly!</p></body></html>

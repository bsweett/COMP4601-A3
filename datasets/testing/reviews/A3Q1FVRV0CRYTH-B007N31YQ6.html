When she loses her case against the doctor who caused the car accident she was involved in she somewhat forces her way into a clerical job at the law offices of Ed Masry (Albert Finney), the lawyer that lost her case.  After reading a few files and growing genuinely concerned about a few clients Erin decides to investigate a case involving poisoned water supply that is slowing killing off the residents in Hinkley, California.  Julia gives such an effortless performance here that she doesn't even appear to be acting.  Everything is so natural, and that can be said for her cast mates as well.  Albert Finney is brilliant as the lawyer who's as offset as he is intrigued by his new employee's personality.  He perfectly compliments her in every scene they share, and the same can be said for Aaron Eckhart who plays George, Erin's neighbor who falls in love with her and offers her the stability she's always needed and never received.  This film, if nothing else, is a beautiful canvas for these talented actors, but acting aside, the script helps move the film along effortlessly and smoothly offering a top notch movie experience that never grows weary or tired.</p></body></html>

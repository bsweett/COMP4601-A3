Watching the trailers I thought it was the typical underdog movie where a ballerina overcomes the obstacles and becomes the "Swan Queen". When I saw it in theaters, it was a completely a different experience. Black Swan is about a ballet ballerina but her biggest obstacle is herself. Being raised by an over-protective mother and being treated like a child, poor Nina never has "loosen herself". Her primal goal it's to be perfect and when her director casts her as the Swan Queen in the new production of Swan Lake she pushes herself to the limit both physically and mentally to be able to transform herself into the virginal White Swan and the seductive Black Swan effortlessly. This will cost her sanity and ultimately she succumbs to dementia.<br /><br />Black Swan is such a crazy film in the good sense of the world. It's a psychological thiller that captures you since the very beginning and never let you go until the very end. Aronofsky's direction is bold and masterful and the cast is superb. Natalie Portman carries the picture spectacularly and the film wouldn't have the same impact if it weren't for her masterful performance. She really earned her Oscar.<br /><br />Black Swan is without a doubt one of the best pictures of last year and with an excellent direction, wonderful score and spectacular performances this thriller will take you in a roller coaster of high quality entertinment.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Black Swan arrives on BD with a great transfe. Filmed with a variety of cameras, the film has a thick grain structure and skin tones are really detailed. Blacks are solid and there are no signs of compression artifacts or other anormalities. A great picture transfer by Fox. Likewise the 5.1 DTS-HD MA  is a great companion to the picture enhancing the score and providing a solid audio presentation. Dialogues are crisp and clear. Well done Fox.<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />You have some goodies in the bonus features department. First and most important is the documentary "Black Swan Metamorphosis" which deals with all the aspects of the production of the film. It's a great documentary. Then also you have short promotional featurettes dealing with the ballet, production design, costumes, cast profiles and interviews and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />A digital copy is also offered.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Black Swan is an instant classic and has a lot of good qualities that makes this film a must-own title. With great video and audio and a good quality of bonus features this BD is highly recommended to anyone who appreciates a good movie.</p></body></html>

This was a big-budget movie, and it looks like they used mega-millions for it's "look".  Also, different types of gags took a lot of care to construct.  One of the very few gags that works is a cameo appearance by Nathan Lane, looking very comfortable in drag, mouthing the dialog of the chick from Destiny's Child, while said chick is sitting right behind him.  <p>But disappointingly, there is almost nothing else in this film that was watch able to me, and I thought this one would be enjoyable, which the first one was.  The second had it's moments, but was already getting very repetitive.  This one's totally forgettable.  <p>Going back to the careful construction of gags is partially my point.  It was humorous and creative in the first movie when Powers and his lady friend carefully avoided showing genitalia by all sorts of clever tricks.  Well, they kind of rehash that in reverse with dialog here, showing parts of phrases, which start out as potty humor, but are revealed to be different messages entirely.<p>Which is the biggest complaint, which is the writing.  The first movie threw a lot of sexual innuendo into the horny Austin Powers character, who not only came from a more promiscuous time, but had a lot of adjustments to make for modern society.  May of these were clever, but there's none of that freshness now. It's now all been replaced by bad pun after assembly-line bad pun, and it wears thin very quickly.  <p>Finally, the title character villain is as uninteresting a character as one can imagine.  Dr. Evil was a pretty good imitation of James Bond Blofeld character, but for whatever reason, they decide to make Goldmember Dutch.  This leaves room for golden wooden shoes as part of the costume, which is only mildly amusing, but then it takes the character absolutely nowhere.  <p>Like the now-defunct Batman series, this one decided to go the route of expensive sets and high-class choreography.  What destroyed both series was the virtual desertion of any kind of original plot whatsoever.  My biggest disappointment is that while Batman died the death it deserved, this one might be around for a few more installments.</p></body></html>

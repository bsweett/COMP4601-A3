<meta name="summary" content="Yuppie,Psycho Killer Black Comedy."></head><body><p>Imagine a combination of  Bonfire of the Vanities, Fight Club and Theatre of Death and you'll get an idea of what the film American Psycho is like-- Yuppies, testosterone, and high camp.  It zeroes in on the easiest of targets, and delights in skewering the yuppie life-style in sick and sadistic fashion.  Well that's not exactly true --  in Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 best-seller the victims were mostly  mercilessly tortured before they were brutally killed and every detail was grimly described.  It was a very disturbing book.  It almost wasn't published.<p>The film however, barely touches on the sadism and misogyny of the book.  It's a poseur film, skimming the surfaces of already overly- skimmed surfaces, making very easily made points, and getting very obvious and easy laughs.  <p>This compromise is significant when compared to the book, the book took the plunge and never came up for air.  That's why the book just won't go completely away, it might not have a lot on its mind, but it sure cuts right to the bone.  Forget about the book, though, few have actually read it.  Quite a few bought it and started to read it, but most didn't finish it.  It's too gross, too bloody, too bleak, too sick, and too repetitious.  <p>I was surprised at how much fun I had while watching the film, knowing what a watered down compromise it is.  Perhaps  watching the yuppies of the 80's getting their deserved bashing is the updated equivalent of snobby rich folks who wind up getting hit with pies in Three Stooges shorts.  It's quite fun.  <p>Another big reason for enjoying  it all so much is Christian Bale.  He plays the part with the kind of put on airs the reminded  me of some not quite human mix of Vincent Price and James Mason trapped inside a California type male model.  And though the performance is mannered, it doesn't feel forced.  It's not a performance coming from a stage actor ,who would be too keenly aware of when an audience might be reacting or laughing.  It's the type of performance a film actor like DeNiro, would have delivered to us when he was younger.  Now Bale hardly looks like an average  New Yorker as Patrick Bateman but I found the performance very entertaining. It carries the film. <p>Patrick Bateman is an extremely successful business man, his dad is a major stockholder so he's got job security and so is bored and easily distracted.  Patrick plays the competitive game with his co-workers, making sure he has the latest gadgets, the right shoes, the expensive tailored suits.  He must keep fit and look good and employs an exacting ritual involving soaps, creams, facial masks and herbal lotions to make sure he looks his best every day.  He works out obsessively, sometimes while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  However, he barely has his own identity.  A running joke in the film has him being mistaken for one of his co-workers.  A key scene in the film involves an in-depth analysis and discussion about Business Cards.  Low key, but specially designed business cards that the young Yuppie's talk about and become envious of.  <p>Eventually we realize that Patrick Bateman (reminiscent of the similarly named Norman Bates) has a strange hobby.  He likes to kill.  We first see his dark side when a street person begs him for money.  Suddenly, Bateman savagely stabs the pitiful beggar.  Afterward he straightens his clothing, sighs, and goes about his business.  Just a way to relieve some stress, a way to cope with the pressure.<p>In other words, here's a Yuppie who has completely twisted any sense of morals to believe someone else's life is as insignificant as a two year old BMW.  Can he really get away with this? We find out he sure can.  He seems unstoppable.<p>The film could have wound up being flat and stale.  But it never is.  It's a film about style, made with some flair and it feels fresher than it has any right to.  This is because there is a  feminist viewpoint brought to the film by  Mary Harron who directed and co-wrote the film with Guinevere Turner.  The film's Patrick Bateman is a selfish, self obsessed, type A driven male.  A fragile, preening creature that is not an atypical Hollywood movie serial killer nor a killer who murders when in a  homicidal rage.  In fact this killer prefers to control the stage he kills in, often able to provide his own background music, maybe something by Huey Lewis, or  maybe something by Phil Collins. Patrick Bateman is a big fan of songs like It's Hip to Be Square and SuSudio.  To Patrick Bateman, killing is his true orgasm.  He can  control himself for short periods of time, but he's  weak, he's male and he's gonna blow sooner or later.  He's going to kill and kill again.  Maybe all this killing is even all in his mind -- nothing more than a twisted yuppie fantasy. Then again, perhaps it's not.  Whatever he can't completely control --he kills.  If something gets through to him, touches him, or exposes something vulnerable,-- he kills.  <p>Willem Dafoe playing a detective on Bateman's trail was a great idea, but nothing is done with it, and Reese Witherspoon seems the kind of future trophy wife a guy like Bateman would have.  Jared Leto  plays  the kind of Yuppie scum everyone hates.  In fact we hate this guy so much he makes Bateman palatable.  His character is named Paul Allen which is funnier now, (particularly to someone in the NorthWest) than it was when the book was written. <p>Chloe (Boys Don't Cry) Sevigny as a secretary who has a crush on Bateman makes a real impression.  She finds a sweetness within her character that humanizes and warms every scene she's in.  Without her performance the film would be a completely cold exercise in style. Cara Seymour plays a prostitute Bateman picks up to play games.  She finds a fascinating balance of fear, vulnerability, need and self-loathing in her portrayal and makes a lasting impression though her screen time is short. <p>It's a sick black comedy with some truly twisted ideas. The gore in the film however is not as plentiful as you might think and none of it feels real enough to be disturbing.<p></p></body></html>

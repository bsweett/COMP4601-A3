<meta name="summary" content="hard to like movie even with the awesome judd in it."></head><body><p>ashley judd is a awesome actress and it's not her fault that this movie is so hard to like. The movie is dark and about a man's madness and not about bugs really , at least real or sci fi bugs like the interesting 70's sci fi flick 'bugs' in which bugs catch people on fire!  Instead we get a story about derangement, this type of derangement is quite common with methheads though. I knew some that thought bugs and crap were eating into them. nice, but meth is insane anyways. This guy isn't a methead and the movie is so dark and like the play it came from. It was scheduled for a blu ray release but that never happened. This movie is hard to like , it has a great director even but this was not his finest moment in the least.  You must be in the mood for this one, unlike the intriguing 'bugs' which you can  just watch and enjoy this one you have to slog through and inspite of the good performances the story about mutual madness , which does happen, why else do mothers let their men mistreat their kids after all? is just a hard watch. The picture is good though as it was a newer movie.</p></body></html>

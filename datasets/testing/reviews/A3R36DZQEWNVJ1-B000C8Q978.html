<meta name="summary" content="Bill Murray's dead on performance is marvelous"></head><body><p>Bill Murray (Rushmore, Life Aquatic) stars as Don Johnston (sometimes people say Don Johnson after he's said it), who worked with computers and as of lately his girlfriend Julie Delpy (Before Sunrise, Before Sunset) left him for good. He gets a mysterious pink letter in the mail with no name of return address on it saying that he has a son and he reads it to his friend Winston, played by the always amazing Jeffrey Wright (Shaft, Syriana). Winston then wants to investigate this letter more and he tells Don to write down all the names of the women he dated back then. Winston then finds the names and sends Don on a trip all over the place as Don visits the women from his past. First up is Sharon Stone (Basic Instinct, Total Recall) who has a teenager named Lolita, played by Alexis Dziena (Havoc, Wonderland). Dziena bares all in one scene which might make some people look away. But that doesnt ruin the film. When he gets done with her he goes to the next one, played by Frances Conroy (Six Feet Under) who is married to Christopher McDonald (The Perfect Storm, Quiz Show). Then he goes to animal communicator Carmen, played by Jessica Lange (Rob Roy, Titus) and then he visits a biker chick, played by the wonderful Tilda Swinton (Constantine, The Deep End). Don even gets his ass kicked when he visits her. Lastly he visits the grave of "Little Michelle Pepe" and goes back home where he encounters The Kid, played by Mark Webber (People I Know, Winter Solstice) who might be the son he is looking for. Bascially what you might find in a Jim Jarmusch film and Murray gives a marvelous tour de force performance...he hasnt lost his touch. Also starring Chloe Sevigny (Brown Bunny, Kids), Chris Bauer (8MM, Third Watch), Larry Fessenden (Habit, Session 9) and Pell James (Undiscovered, The King).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What to do about Diana's death?"></head><body><p>Hellen Mirren gives Queen Elizabeth such a regal human element that you can't help feeling for the Queen during what had to be a very trying time for the monarchy.  The movie focuses specifically on the days that followed Diana's death.  A surprisingly compact film that gives one a relatively intimate look at the royal family without delving too deeply into the emotions.  Prince Philip and the Queen Mother are presented as the most callous figures in this film, while Prince Charles agonizes over the impact Diana's death will have on the family, particularly "the boys," which are seen only from the back and not mentioned by name.  Meanwhile, the Queen is torn between protocol and what appear to be her own emotions regarding Diana's death.<br /><br />Your opinion of the monarchy after the tragedy of Diana won't be swayed much one way or the other by this movie as Stephen Frears plays it pretty close to the hip.  About the only thing new is the apparent feelings of Tony Blair in regard to the monarchy, doing his best to advise the royal family of the impact the death of Diana was having on the British people at the time, and getting them to come out of their sequestered Balmoral estate, where most of the action takes place.  Michael Sheen offers an uncanny performance as Blair, capturing his character to a tee.</p></body></html>

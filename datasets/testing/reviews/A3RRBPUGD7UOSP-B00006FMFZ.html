<meta name="summary" content="Tom Hanks Brings a 3-Star Film Up to 4 Stars."></head><body><p>This was one of those films that I wasn't sure I wanted to watch. Being a big fan of Tom Hanks, I was afraid that he'd chosen a bad script. I was partially right.<p>The gangster film genre isn't one I particularly like, so when I got it, I watched it with a grain of salt. The strong acting of all the actors, Hanks in particular, made this movie much better than the it would have been with other actors. I keep seeing time and time again how great an actor Hanks is, and this film was no exception.<p>Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a mob hitman who goes on the run from the very mob family he's worked for since he was a kid, after his son witnesses to one of Sullivan's 'hits'. With bits of misplaced comedy throughout the film, it was hard to know exactly how to feel. The film went from scenes of machine gun violence, to humor, and back to violence. Guys, next time, go one way or the other. The excellent drama was lambasted by the humorous scenes that either precede or follow them. Remove the humor, and you've got 'Once Upon a Time in America', or better.</p></body></html>

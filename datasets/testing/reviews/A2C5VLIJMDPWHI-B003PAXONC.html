<meta name="summary" content="A boat load of strange"></head><body><p>This movie is quite possibly the strangest one I've ever seen. I had no idea what it was about before I rented it and just got it because Will Smith was in the movie.<br />About the movie: Scientific testing supposedly cured 10,009 people of cancer. However, something in that medicine had a negative affect on these people afterwards. People started acting more like animals, killing and abusing each other for prey. Only a select few were immune to bites from this savage group and from getting the disease that swept the world. In comes Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith) who is immune to the disease but still fears for his life and that of his gorgeous German Shepherd, who is his best friend and only confidant that is alive. Both he and his dog prowl the area for surviving human beings.<br /><br />Pros: I love dogs like most humans love babies so I spent quite a bit of the time grinning and going "Aw" when the German Shepherd did cute things like not eating its vegetables or licking Smith's face. As a puppy, you could've put that dog on a postcard and framed it to your wall. The movie is definitely unique and took some great risks and a very unromantic twist about "the last man on Earth." With such a serious film, there were definitely some uncomfortable comedic scenes, like Dr. Neville being so lonely for comfort that he has now decided to holla at female mannequins. The special effects could make the average horror film phobic jump at every scene, and I enjoyed them.<br /><br />Cons: I never figured out what the purpose of the lion and deer was supposed to be, especially considering you never saw another lion in the movie again so it wasn't like the city completely turned into a jungle.</p></body></html>

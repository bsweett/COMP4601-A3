Some of the effects are really cool to look at, but the mixture of mod-tech with a realtively visually unchanged rest of the world looked off to me.  Also, the story is pretty pedestrian in spite of it's excellent premise.  Underneath all of the fancy gadgets and clever lights is the same old tired mystery that is too easy to figure out.

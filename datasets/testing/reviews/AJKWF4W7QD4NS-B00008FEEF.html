Halloween 2 picks up where the first left off, with Michael Myers still on the loose and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) on his trail.  Survivor Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is nearly catatonic and is being taken care of at a hospital, but we soon find out that Michael is on her trail as well.  John Carpenter wrote the script but opted not to direct this second installment (although it is said that he re-shot some scenes here and there) which is a big drawback of the film.  Director Rick Rosenthal (who directed the latest Halloween: Resurrection) decided to go without most of the cat & mouse-esque Carpenter style suspense of the first film, opting instead to make the film much more graphic than the original.  This adds nothing to the film, and the momentary lapses of logic are almost mind numbing.  However, this is an important chapter in the Halloween saga, as we learn more about Michael's background including why he is so hell bent on killing Laurie.  All in all, Halloween 2 certainly isn't the worst of the series, but don't go into it expecting something as great as the original.</p></body></html>

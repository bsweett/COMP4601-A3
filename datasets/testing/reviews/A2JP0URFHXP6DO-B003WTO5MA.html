<meta name="summary" content="A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT"></head><body><p>I had high hopes for this remake.  The original 1979 film was a decent film but hardly a classic and certainly didn't do justice to the book which is one of the most terrifying books I had ever read.  But instead of improving upon the original, director Andrew Douglas, in his first major directing credit, goes instead for cheap scares and overused horror cliches and changes the story so much as to become completely unrecognizable from Jay Anson's book.<br /><br />You know the story...Ronald DeFeo kills his entire family in 1974 by shooting them with a shotgun as they slept.  He claims voices told him to do it.  A year later, George and Kathy Lutz move into the home with their 3 kids and dog Harry.  The colonial is way under priced and the deal of a lifetime and the Lutz's jump at the chance to get it.  Almost immediately the sinister house begins to affect the family.  Daughter Chelsea begins seeing and talking to an imaginary friend named Jodie who is the spirit of little murdered Jodie Defeo.  Here is overused horror cliche' #1...the creepy little girl ghost.  Seems every horror film these days has to have a creepy little girl ghost in it.  Of course in the book and original film Jodie was a pig whose shining red eyes George would see in Chelea's window.<br /><br />George is also affected by the home first with an unnatural chill.  He begins to spend much of his time in the basement feeding wood into the furnace.  Again, this is a change when it was the fireplace in the living room that George spent his time around.  A home in the mid-1970's doesn't have a forced air furnace?  George also begins seeing strange things which brings us to overused horror cliche #2.  You know whenever someone bends over a sink and then back up straight that there is going to be a terrifying image in the mirror.  Douglas gets huge mileage out of this cliche having twisted demonic faces appaear to george in mirrors, in the water of his boathouse, even on screen as he watches a home movie.<br /><br />George is becoming more and more hostile to his wife and step-children and increasingly violent due to the house's influence.<br /><br />The original film did a far better job of showing George's gradual decline into madness but this is streamlined here in order to show more fancy digital effects.<br /><br />Oh...and someone please explain why the ghost of Jodie has a single bullet hole through her forehead if she was killed by a shotgun???  While the book and original film had all of the family experiencing very tangible effects such as blood dripping from the walls, carpet being rolled up, black goo pouring from toilets and sinks, Douglas seeks to go for a more psychological angle to the horror and it just doesn't work as well.  Douglas and script writer Scott Kosar come up with some half-brained plot about a 17th century reverend who tortured and murdered indians on the site where the home is located which is completely unnecessary and over the top.<br /><br />I like Ryan Reynolds but it's hard buying him in this role after his long string of sophmoric comedies.  Both he and Mellisa George who played Kathy Lutz were a bit too young...or at least young looking, for their roles in this film.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful opportunity was missed to improve upon a so-so original film.</p></body></html>

Film companies that own the rights to various characters have often held them in check, not wanting to share the wealth made by them. But now, since interest in both seems to have dwindled, they look to join the duo to make more money. And that was done this weekend as the movie took over the box office. The question is, was it worth the wait?<br /><br />The answer is a resounding yes. Fright film fans can rejoice in one of the best of both series. And with the success of this movie, it can't be long until Michael Myers joins in the fray (yes, talks are already under way).<br /><br />The movie begins with Freddy (the returning Robert Englund) bemoaning the fact that he is no longer remembered and thus has no way to return to the world to wreak havoc. Looking of a way back, he finds Jason (Ken Kirzinger) in the bowels of Hell, resurrects him and sends him back to Elm Street to remind the folks there what terror is all about.<br /><br />Jason follows instructions (given to him by his mother, actually Freddy appearing as same). He begins slaughtering teens in the house Freddy once stalked and when the police show, one young officer is chastised for mentioning Freddy's name within earshot of the teens. If not mentioned or remembered, how can he return?<br /><br />That one mention snowballs and eventually the whole town remembers and discusses Freddy. Jason primarily focuses on Lori (Monica Keena) whose ex boyfriend Will (Jason Ritter) has been locked away in a mental institute from his weigh in with Freddy long ago. There with his best friend, the pair along with most of those who had contact with Freddy have been kept dreamless with the help of a test drug. Will and friend escape and set out to find and help Lori and friends from the evil they know exist.<br /><br />Given strength by Jason, Freddy returns to the dream world of the teens in town and begins his assault on another of Lori's friends. But as he is about to claim her soul, she disappears when Jason kills her in the real world. The terror Freddy set free is ruining his chances to scare the world. I mean, how can he send out scares if no one is alive to dream of him? The showdown is set in motion and now it just takes time.<br /><br />The teens come upon an idea to lure Freddy into the real world and let the two titans of terror face off against one another. Their plan is to do so at Camp Crystal Lake so that once, they hope, Jason finishes Freddy, they can send Jason back to the watery depths and a final rest. Yes, although he murders viciously (and with much gore), Jason sort of becomes a hero here.<br /><br />Would I tell you the final outcome? No way! Just know that the movie keeps your interest throughout, setting up the final confrontation between these two. Did I say final? As anyone with any amount of horror film knowledge knows, nothing is final in a horror icon flick.<br /><br />The acting is well done, with all characters appearing seamless in their roles making them quite believable. Englund has done this role over and over again and yet each time he shows why no one else could have done the part. Much to do was made of the fact that Kane Hodder (who has played Jason since number 6) was not hired to play him here. Know what? It's a guy in a mask! Kirzinger does a solid job in that function.<br /><br />The movie may not be overflowing with new scares, but that's not what's expected here. What we are looking for is a decent story, a few laughs, a steady pace and a few buckets of gore. This movie delivers on all counts.</p></body></html>

The movie, based on Guevara's memoirs, is the story of how Che went from being just another bourgeois medical student to being a crusader for workers' rights and an idol to communists around the globe. As such, the movie has been much castigated in America as being a glorification of communism or the like.<br /><br />In fact, Guevara's great awakening takes a somewhat surprising back seat to the journey itself here, and that's one of the things that makes The Motorcycle Diaries into such a wonderful, and watchable, movie. Bernal and De la Serna are both fine actors, and the chemistry between the two is easily the equal of that to be found in any Hollywood buddy-cop movie of the last ten years. Director Walter Salles (Central Station) and screenwriter Jose Rivera (Eerie, Indiana) decided, quite rightly, to focus on that chemistry, to make The Motorcycle Diaries the story of a friendship that happens to contain a political awakening, rather than a political awakening that happens to be couched within a friendship, and it makes all the difference. You can choose to see it as a political film, or you can choose to see it as a buddy film. One way or the other, though, you should see it. ****</p></body></html>

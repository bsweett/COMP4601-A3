At first, I was very impressed by his love for the wild animals but further into the picture I began to understand that there was something unhealthy in his obsession, that he was deluded. He took it upon himself to "take care" of the grizzly bears, to "protect" them but I don't believe that they needed his protection. He needed them to make his life more useful and meaningful and nothing is wrong with that but in doing so he had crossed the line - he humanized them and he saw himself as the part of grizzly world. He kept repeating feverishly that he would gladly die for them and should he be killed by them he would not want any of them hurt. Well, it all ended tragically - he and his girlfriend (who joined him during the last summer) were attacked by a bear, killed and partially eaten. The bitter irony is that he had sacrificed not only himself but another human life. The bear that killed them, the very creature Treadwell was so in love with, was killed by the police the day after Treadwell's and Emmy's death. Many people say that he got what he deserved when he chose to cross the dangerous line and get too close to the ferocious animals. But he also got what none of us would get - he got Werner Herzog to make a documentary about him. Herzog used the footage (almost 100 hours) that Timothy Treadwell had shot during all these years. Herzog' was the only artist who could say so much and so well about man's obsession that borders with madness. He narrated the movie himself and he said that in his opinion the common denominators for the Universe are chaos, hostility, and murder - not harmony. Anyone who saw Herzog's films would agree with the statement. I just want to add that Universe in his movies radiates magnificent indifference (in the best case scenario), not warmth or love.</p></body></html>

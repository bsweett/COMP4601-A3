<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Spielberg Sci-Fi Romp"></head><body><p>This one has the Spielberg stamp all over it from beginning to end; if you liked E.T. you'll probably like this one too. I definitely fall into that camp and did in fact have a good time with this movie. It was fun to watch, interesting, fast paced and exciting to me.<br /><br />Although it didn't develop any really new sci-fi story ideas it did a good job of handling some tried and true sci-fi plot schemes and was in several ways similar to E.T. The acting and special effects were good and the kids did a very good job of carrying the movie. As sometimes happens in this kind of movie the military and the government are painted as villains and come across as not very nice.<br /><br />In summary the story holds one's attention and the acting effectively draws the viewer into the story so the movie goes by quickly. The special effects are rather spectacular so the overall package provides an action-filled movie that is entertaining.</p></body></html>

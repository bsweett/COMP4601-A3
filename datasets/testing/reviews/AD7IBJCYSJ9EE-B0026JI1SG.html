<meta name="summary" content="The rise and fall of Maggie Fitzgerald"></head><body><p>Wow! I just seen this film on PPV and all I have to say is AMAZING! Brillantly thought out, well-acted, realistic, and dramatic!<br /><br /> Maggie is a woman who dreams of becoming a boxer. Her family is struggling, her brother's in jail, her dad's dead, and her mom is a lazy fat oaf. Boxing trainer Frankie Dunn doesn't want to train a girl, but Maggie's pretty damn stubborn and eventually he agrees to. They form quite a tight bond, and she becomes a great female boxer. But soon something tragic happens [I won't tail!] and Frankie has to make a decision that might change his life.<br /><br /> This film is not for people of faint heart, nor is it for people who want happy endings. It's a brutal, hard, and crafted work of art that you must see. It deserves all the Awards it got!</p></body></html>

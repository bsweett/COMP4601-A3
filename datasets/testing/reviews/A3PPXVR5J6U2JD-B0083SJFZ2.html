<meta name="summary" content="Big, Dumb Kraken of a Movie"></head><body><p>Like many of my peers who grew up in the eighties, Clash of the Titans holds a special place in my heart.  Harryhausen's vision burned certain iconic moments in my memory:  My Clash of the Titan's lunchbox.  My winged Pegasus toy with Harry Hamlin-looking Perseus (complete with vacuous gaze and stiff arms).  Shouting "Perseus!" and throwing any stick-like object (hockey sticks, bats, edged weapons) to my friends. All these elements have ensured a certain reverence for Clash of the Titans, not to mention hopelessly muddling my knowledge of Greek history until well into my high school years.<br /><br />This new version of Clash of the Titans is not that movie (spoilers ahead!):<br /><br />Oh, it's a reimagining of course.  There are attempts to provide the shadow of a coherent plot to the whole thing.  The original was actually a love story; the jealous goddess Thetis became Perseus' nemesis over his love for poor Andromeda, with Zeus surreptitiously helping his errant son.  In the remake Zeus is openly hostile to humanity, who is apparently attempting to overthrow the gods by...blowing up their statues, I guess. Hades manipulates Zeus into terrorizing humanity instead of asking for their prayers.  Two drachmas to the person who guesses the trick Hades has up his sleeve.<br /><br />The movie hits all the high points: Calibos (Acrisius in the new version), Pegasus, Medusa, the scorpions, the Kraken.  And for the first half at least, the plot shambles along pleasantly and the audience can marvel at the breathtaking score and dizzying 3D.<br /><br />Then the Djinn show up.  I have a phrase I called "jump the monkey" which is a bit like "jump the shark." The last installment of Indiana Jones had me interested until vine-swinging monkeys jumped to the rescue of our hero.  The moment turned pulp heroic fun into retrograde cartoon pandering to audiences of all ages.  The Djinn are Clash of the Titans' "monkey jump."<br /><br />Because this new incarnation of the movie has to be Bigger and Better than anything we've seen before, the scorpions that arise from Acrisius' blood (not Medusa's like in the original) are gargantuan. So big, in fact, that it stretches our willing suspension of disbelief that our heroes will even be able to defeat them.  And then they do.  Whew! A jump cut later and...<br /><br />BIGGER scorpions show up.  These are colossal.  Our heroes can't possibly defeat them.  Fortunately, we have a deus ex machine in the form of Djinn.  They are "sand demons," some kind of Greek-style cyborgs who replace their broken bodies with magic.  They have cool blue glowing eyes and know how to control giant scorpions.  Actually, they RIDE them.<br /><br />Scorpions.  Giant scorpions.  That didn't exist until Acrisius bled.  The Djinn carry around entire howdahs just to ride these giant scorpions in the span of just one day.  I made up a reason for why this is. Surely the scorpions were created from the sand, not Acrisius' blood, and that's why the Djinn are so familiar with them.  Yeah, okay, I'll roll with it...<br /><br />But wait...why are the Djinn still hanging around?  Why is one of the Djinn joining Perseus' party?  Why, when Perseus is trying to rouse his troops as they descend into Medusa's lair, is the Greek equivalent of a Wookie going along with them? Why has this movie jumped the monkey?<br /><br />I was so dazzled by the special effects that it didn't even dawn on me until my wife pointed it out. Medusa's gaze doesn't work on the Djinn, but it works on a Kraken? Did anyone else notice this Kraken-sized flaw in the plot?  Or did the directors just figure the 3D would make up for it?<br /><br />It didn't.  As much as I tried to love this new version of Clash of the Titans, I can't.  I can merely appreciate it for the big, dumb, Kraken of a movie it is.</p></body></html>

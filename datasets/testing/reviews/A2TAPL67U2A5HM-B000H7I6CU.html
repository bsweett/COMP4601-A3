<meta name="summary" content="Cars (Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Cars (Widescreen Edition)~ Owen Wilson is a good animated movie that I feel is a bit too oriented towards the American market. Most people in the rest of the world do not watch Nascar and therefore many of the Nascar references are lost on people that do not watch it. The animation is great, the storyline is well written, the music is really good. The message of the movie is that one needs to take responsibility for ones actions, be tolerant and not be haughty. The story centers around a haughty race car called Lightning McQueen that learns respect, tolerance and the true meaning of family. It started out poorly and just became better and better. But still I give it 4 stars out of 5.</p></body></html>

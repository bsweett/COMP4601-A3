The movie has great actors, awesome visual effects and absolutely nothing that I did not like. This is 100% my favorite zombie movie from now on. Here is the story about zombies that actually start to think and understand the very basics of what and where and how to overcome the obstacles. Thinking zombies that also start to communicate with each other, are just awesome. And without giving away any spoilers I absolutely loved the ending (''They are just looking for their place to live''). Here is the real story, which I loved. There is a real teamwork in this movie, well developed characters and friendship among some, and just as much action as needed to be and not too much of any of those. This movie is awesome and you must see it for yourself!</p></body></html>

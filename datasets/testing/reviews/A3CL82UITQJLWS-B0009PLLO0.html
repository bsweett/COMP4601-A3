<meta name="summary" content="queer eye for the so called greatest alexander"></head><body><p>I had high expectations for the movie. I was sadly let down. This is trash, pure & simple. Alex wasn't "great"... he betrayed his own people, wanted to conquer the whole world due to his own relentless selfishness and was bi-sexual! The scene w/ him and boy george disgusted me, that dark amazon looking wench was gross too. don't waste your time or money on this filth...PASS!!</p></body></html>

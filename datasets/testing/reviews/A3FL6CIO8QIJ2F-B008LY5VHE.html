<meta name="summary" content=""Jaws Is A Blockbuster""></head><body><p>"Jaws" was really the first Hollywood film that started the tradition of Hollywood releasing blockbuster movies during the summer. The film, as many know, is about a great white shark terrorizing a seaside community in Cape Cod, and its up to the police chief, Sheriff Brody, played by Roy Scheider, to stop the killings and destroy the shark.<br /> I first saw this movie on television in the late '70s, and it terrified me to the point of not be able to sleep for nights, so I wouldn't recommend it to children under 12 because the film is extremely graphic for its time. It is however an excellent film in the horror genre.<br /> Steven Speilberg had his first hit as a director of this film, and it would be his work on "Jaws" that brought him to the attention of other movie studios. The haunting theme music, composed by John Willimas, still remains the most chilling movie theme in history, and it won Williams an Oscar for Best Original Music for a film.<br /> "Jaws" is also one of those rare Hollywood films that made the cover of "Time" magazine in 1975. It became a worldwide phenomenon and made millions at the boxoffice. It stayed in the Top 10 of the highest making films until 1997, when "Titanic" became the biggest grosser.<br /> There have been many sequels to this blockbuster, but only one is worth watching and buying: "Jaws 2", released in 1978. Nowhere near as great as the original, "Jaws 2" is a worthy sequel, also starring Scheider. Forget about all the other "Jaws" films out there: they are cheaply produced and horribly written and directed.<br /> This DVD comes with a ton of bonuses, but the jewel here is the documentary on the film, with neat info and great anecdotes.</p></body></html>

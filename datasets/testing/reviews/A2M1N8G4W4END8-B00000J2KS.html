Viddy Well."></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick's 1971 adaptation of the classic Anthony Burgess novel A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is a thriller for thinkers.  That is, it is a frightening but compelling SF-ish flick that, like the novel, is wrapped around deep socio-political and philosophical subtext.  It warns about the dangers of blithe, government-dictated social conformity, yet it also cautions against allowing citizens to indulge in so much freedom that society becomes unsafe and anarchic.  In other words, it forces viewers to ponder the question of just how far citizens of a society can have their free will restricted before they cease to be truly free...or truly human.<p>Set in an England of the &quot;near&quot; future, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE paints a picture of a British dystopia that, in some respects, is more horrific and more depressing--and in retrospect, closer to the reality of the 3+ decades that have passed since its release--than the Oceania of Orwell's 1984.  Malcolm McDowell stars as Alex de Large, a teenage ruffian who nightly roams the streets of his hometown with a gang of other sadistic young hoodlums (his &quot;droogs&quot;) and engages in acts of &quot;ultra-violence&quot; (i.e., robbery, rape, pummelings, murder, etc.).  Other such gangs of thugs also roam the streets at night, so going outside after dark is a dangerous prospect for the average citizen.<p>Following a botched burglary and murder, Alex is temporarily blinded and left behind by his craven droogs.  Young Alex is arrested for the murder when the police arive, and soon after he is found guilty and sentenced to a lengthy prison term.  But he thinks he has secured his quick ticket to freedom when he is accepted into a program that promises to &quot;cure&quot; his violent propensities and, upon successful completion of the program, nullify his prison sentence.  Unbeknownst to Alex, though, is that the procedure is based on Pavlovian conditioning techniques, meaning that Alex won't be &quot;cured&quot; so much as he will be brainwashed into autonomically behaving like a respectable, law-abiding citizen.<p>Due to the nature of the film's subject matter--and, of course, to help drive home its subtextual message--A CLOCKWORK ORANGE contains many disturbing and violent scenes, including the depiction of a beating and rape during which Alex &quot;kicks&quot; out his rendition of &quot;Singing in the Rain.&quot;  Some viewers, especially those not normally inclined towards watching horror or crime dramas, have a difficult time looking past the violence and delving into the film's subtext.  For those folks, it might be easier to emotionally and intellectually grasp the theme of Kubrick's film if they FIRST read Burgess' novel.  (For most viewers, though, enjoyment of the movie does not require familiarity with the novel.)<p>A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is fairly loyal to the source material, though Burgess' complete work includes a final chapter that is not depicted in the film.  Supposedly this is because Kubrick only had access to the American edition of the book--this despite the fact that he was an American expatriate living in England--in which the last chapter had been removed because Burgess' American editors considered it inconsistent with the rest of the novel.  Literary purists, who will often make value judgments about a film based on its adherence to the printed source, will probably be put off by Kubrick's purportedly inadvertent omission.  However, as with any other well-made film, it should be judged solely on its own merits.<p>With A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick questions the perceptions of freedom and the concepts of crime and punishment in Western society.  The film is a truculent and thought-provoking socio-political satire that, after more than three decades, still retains its ability to shock viewers into philosophical rumination.  Of course, Kubrick's excellent script and tight direction contribute to the film's success in eliciting such a reaction, but so does Malcolm McDowell's energetic and compelling performance as Alex, that rare protagonist who is equally reprehensible and pitiable.  <p>All in all, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is an excellent and still-relevant classic that belongs in the collection of any serious lover of great movies.</p></body></html>

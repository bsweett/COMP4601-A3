<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie in a weak year for even halfway decent ones"></head><body><p>Just a great movie. No real hidden political agenda (other than perhaps wringing every bit you can out of a servicemans enlistment). GREAT acting, plot, direction, editing.....a real surprise considering every other movie I have been unfortunate enough to see that was released this year.<br />I only regret that I didnt see it at the theaters....woulda been even better.....but the video is certainly worth at least renting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Now, if the moviemakers had just read the comic book..."></head><body><p>After reading several scathing reviews of the film and negative commentary from fellow moviegoers like myself, I decided to throw caution to the wind and check out the movie myself.<p>Well, my verdict is in: the movie has its high points (Peta Wilson as Mina Harker, a jaw-dropping turn-of-the-century super automobile, and an interesting turn on the Captain Nemo character plus the crew of the Nautilus).<p>However, the overabundance of computer graphics and the rather poor dialogue can't make this adventure anymore than average.  The fight scenes are too many and the stunt doubles can be too easily spotted for Connery and Naseerudin Shah ("Nemo"). <p>The final battle between Mr. Hyde and a similar incarnation is almost laughable.  Computer-generated special effects were better handled in the two "Lord of the Rings" films.<p>If a possible franchise was in the minds of the filmmakers, then they blew it.  Big budgeted "fireworks" aren't enough to entice filmgoers for a return visit.<p>Think "Lost of Space" of several years ago!<p>Had the moviemakers stayed closer to the spirit and wit of the graphic novel, then this picture would've been more enjoyable.<p>In the words of Marlon Brando from "On the Waterfront", it "coulda been a contender" in the summer blockbuster sweepstakes.</p></body></html>

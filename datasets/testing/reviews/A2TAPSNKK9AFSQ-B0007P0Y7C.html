<meta name="summary" content="A Terrible Comic Book Turned Into A Movie!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is terrible. It is all about this girl Elektra who keeps on getting into fights. Maybe if she lost a few she would enrol in some much needed Anger Management Classes. It is interesting to note that according to Psychiatric Terminology an "Elektra Complex" is when a father wants to have sexual relations with his daughter which is pretty sick and so is this movie. I just read that Jennifer Garner has been voted for an Emmy which was a big surprise to me because I personally don't think she could emote  even after falling off a cliff. I guess some guys just can't see further than a pretty face and a good body.I give this movie 5 stars because thankfully it only ran for 1 1/2 hours.</p></body></html>

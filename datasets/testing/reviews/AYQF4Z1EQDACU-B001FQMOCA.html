Joaquin Phonenix & Reese Witherspoon as Johnny & June Carter Cash in "Walk the Line" the true story of the country music legend and the woman who was all the music he ever loved. I see Oscar gold on this masterpiece, Phonenix on fire, he shines,hes marvelous and Witherspoon is an adorable,irresistable little thing. A beautiful onscreen couple. I see Oscar nominations for them both. It's electrifying musical experience to the eye,ear,heart & soul. See it, even if your not a Cash or Carter fan. It not's just the music, it's who performed it. Only if Johnny & June lived to see it, but more importantly they lived it. "why you wearing black, you look like your going to a funeral" "maybe I am" "hello, I'm Johnny Cash"</p></body></html>

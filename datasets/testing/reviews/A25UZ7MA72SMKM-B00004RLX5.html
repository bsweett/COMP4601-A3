<meta name="summary" content="Takes us back to the 60s"></head><body><p>After the first three Star Trek films, where the producers tried hard to push the series into a modern age of special effects, with varying results, they finally settled down and did a Star Trek film that matched the stories that made Trek so popular in the first place. "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home", of the six "Original Series" films, takes me back to what it was like to see a new Star Trek episode when I watched them in the 60s.<br /><br />Even though the fate of planet Earth in the future rode on the success of Kirk and crew's mission to the past, the movie didn't have a serious tone. There was plenty of the light comedy and entertaining character interaction that made Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty such beloved characters in the first place. Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov round things out, and after all, these seven were what made the TV series popular.<br /><br />The overall plot is almost irrelevant. Sure, the Earth is threatened with total destruction (again). Sure, the Enterprise crew goes back in time (again). Sure, of course Kirk and company save the day (again). But all of that is just a vehicle to get the stars we came to respect and the characters we came to love on the screen interacting in amusing and entertaining ways. We have Kirk charming a woman. We have Spock as dizzily out of touch with slang as in "A Piece of the Action". We have Scotty mastering the areas of technology, yet failing to comprehend a computer "mouse". We have a truce between a concerned Bones and a reemerging Spock, yet still with an entertaining interaction between them. Chekov's session of being questioned by Naval officers is hilarious, and would have pleased Abbot and Costello.<br /><br />Instead of "The Voyage Home" you could virtually name this movie "The Trouble with Whales". In this case the problem is not too many tribbles, but too few whales. And the story should keep us humble. Here, Earth, technologically advanced in so many ways, and the Capitol of the United Federation of Planets, is helpless before the arrival of a yet more advanced technology from the endless depths of deep space. Not even the Borg would want to mess with this baby ... and if they'd found and assimilated a world of intelligent whales, once this probe came across them the Borg problem would have been solved the easy way. LOL Yet the probe is not of evil intent, just interested in finding the species it had been assigned to be caretaker.<br /><br />This is Star Trek as I grew to love it, and I thank the people responsible for giving me a look back through the same magic mirror through which I saw the series in the 60s.</p></body></html>

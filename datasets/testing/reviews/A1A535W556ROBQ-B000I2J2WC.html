Ron Howard may religiously follow the text but the end result is a lifeless movie with the actors going through the motions but eliciting little energy in this mildy sacrareligious whodunit?<br /><br />I really don't know why the Catholic Church pitched such a fuss over The Da Vinci Code.  It is first and foremost entertainment.  Anyone who seriously takes the Priory of Sion or the tangled web of deceit that Dan Brown portrayed coming down through the ages needs to read a little more history on the subject.  Nevertheless, it is a compelling story and one that forces you to rethink the role of the church in obscuring the birth of Christ.<br /><br />Dan Brown was at his most compelling when exploring the role of the Sacred Feminine and how the imagined Merovingian line had been protected through the last two millennia by a secret order that apparently influenced popes and kings alike.  Brown casts Opus Dei in a sinister role which I guess is what raised hackles in the Church, moreso than the supposed bloodline of Christ, which has long ago been dismissed as the folly of a Frenchman, Pierre Plantard, who believed he was the descendant of Christ and the rightful heir to the throne of France.  He is the one who apparently concocted the Priory of Sion to give creedence to his claims,  You can read more about Plantard on wikipedia.<br /><br />But then that really isn't the point of the movie.  We are forced to follow our less than dynamic duo through a series of highly questionable and boring action scenes that ultimately lead them to the Rosslyn Chapel, where a resolution of sorts takes place.  I would have liked to have seen a little more of the Sacred Feminine come out in the movie, but it was too much about Professor Langdon and not enough about the role Sophie Neveu played in all this.<br /><br />Ron Howard should stick to "Grinches" and "Beautiful Minds," as he clearly was not up to the task of delivering on the theme.  A movie is not supposed to be a literal interpretation of a novel, especially one as dubious as this one.  It is supposed to have fun with the theme, explore new opportunities and be entertaining.  All of which this movie fails to do.  I give two stars mostly for Sir Ian McKellen, who at least had some fun with the role of Sir Leigh Teabing.</p></body></html>

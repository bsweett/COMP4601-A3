<meta name="summary" content="Not entirely factual, but very truthful"></head><body><p>United 93 is one of the most harrowing movie experiences you're likely to have. This is because, of course, it is based on a real event and the viewer will know the outcome - everyone on the plane dies.  As such, there is no way to know how many of the events depicted on the screen are factual - did the passengers overcome 2 of the hijackers and force their way into the cockpit?  Was the plane headed for the Capitol? (personally, I think it more likely it was headed to the Pentagon, just as 2 planes headed to the WTC)  Was the leader really having second thoughts?  If not, why did the hijackers take so long to make their moves, especially since they were already delayed 30 minutes before takeoff?<br /><br />As the writer and the director, Paul Greengrass speculates on the answers to these questions and presents a logical sequence of events, interspersed with factually verifiable events such as the timing of the WTC hits and the air traffic controllers' conversations.  These scenes recreate the confusion of 9/11 extremely effectively because, as Greengrass points out in the Director's commentary (multiple times), the use of airliners as cruise missiles was simply an inconceivable event.<br /><br />Most difficult to watch, however, are the phone calls home from the passengers on the plane as they call to say good-bye.  Presumably these are the actual words spoken by the passengers, and that verity is extremely personal and difficult to watch.<br /><br />So, if the film is not factual, and does not even claim to be factual, what does it have going for it?  Basically, it feels True.  It never dramatizes the events, and often the dialogue feels "overheard" (even the famous "Let's roll").  The passengers are scared, but in their fear they realise (perhaps the first in the country) what's going on and choose to act.  We never learn anything about them - another correct step by Greengrass, whose goal appears to be putting the film viewer on the plane with the passengers.  They are strangers to us, they are strangers to each other, but they are all in it together and trust each.  Greengrass has been criticized for humanizing the hijackers.  But, of course, the hijackers WERE humans, and to portray them as monsters or psychopaths would deny human nature.<br /><br />Obviously many (most?) will find the film impossible to watch.  For those that can (and you know who you are), you will find newfound respect for the courage of the common man, and newfound sympathy for the people involved - not only those that perished, but those air traffic controllers and others that tried their best in an impossible situation to regain control of a situation they could not have conceieved of that morning when they went to work.</p></body></html>

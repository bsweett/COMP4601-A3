But unfortunately there is much to dislike especially the zombie-like performance of Thora Birch who was asked to play the role of Enid after Chritina Ricci turned it down. Birch plays Enid with the same notes that she played her role in &quot;American Beauty.&quot; The difference is that in AB she was a supporting player but in this film she is the lead. And a lead role requires variety and shading. By the end of the film Birch's never-ending bank stare is bewildering . On the plus side much of the script is smart and witty. But Don Roos did this sort of thing 100% better in &quot;The Opposite of Sex.&quot; And just imagine what Ricci could have done with the role of Enid.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="(In fact 3.5) Powerful Acting, Though Impossible Story"></head><body><p>One interesting thing about 'House of Sand and Fog' is that the film in its opening credits, quite unaccountably, put the name of Jennifer Connelly BEFORE that of Ben Kingsley.  What a strange order, for the strength of the film, which often is marred by clithed direction and improbable story, all comes unmistakeably from Ben Kingsley's powerful acting.<br /><br />The story is quite unbelievable, at least that's what I thought.  Because of some mistakes, one American woman Kathy (Connelly) and one Iranian father (formerly a colonel in his country) Behrani fight over the legal right of ownership of one old house by the seaside.  Kathy, evicted from the home, sticks to her house (her father's house), or the memories attached to it while Beharani, having paid the money, needs it to settle down in this new country.<br /><br />The point of the film is not about the legal side; it's about the characters, all flawed, but all too human.  While there is a better way out for the both parties, and perhaps they know it, they commit many mistakes because of their pride, or obsession, and finally come to the point where there is no turning back.<br /><br />Now, the good thing about the film is its nuance in characters.  They are complex, round, and mostly believable, owing to great acting from Ben Kingsley and Shohreh Aghdashloo as the ex-colonel's wife.  Aghdashloo, herself born in Iran, not only gives credibility to the melodramatic story, but also represents the compassionate, and fragile side of the immigrants coming to America, where little is familiar to them.  And as to masterful performance of Ben Kingsley, what can I add?<br /><br />If Jennifer Connelly pales away beside these two veterans, that is not because her acting is inadequate -- she is perhaps better than in 'Beautiful Mind' -- but because her role, and the sub-plot about the love affair with a local cop (Ron Eldard), are too weak, bleak, and unnecessary.  (And I still suspect that her Oscar winning was a fluke.)<br /><br />THE MOST REGRETTABLE PART OF THE FILM is its ending, or how it comes to there.  Again, we see a familiar plot device -- gun.  After the very emotionally intense and spellbinding scenes, the film allows the B-Hollywood action film clithes to creep into the situation, and blows up the credible tone completely.  The film director (and first-time at that) Vadim Perelman really wanted a tradegy, so HE creates one, disregarding consistency.  Why should the characters act like that, who up until then have been so credible?<br /><br />Among the mediocre direction of the film, you see astounding acting from the two actors -- Kingsley and Aghdashloo.  And the photography of Roger Deakins is another merit of the film.  And the name of Deakins reminds me of the Coen Brothers, who could have made this film much a more plausible and powerful one than it is now.</p></body></html>

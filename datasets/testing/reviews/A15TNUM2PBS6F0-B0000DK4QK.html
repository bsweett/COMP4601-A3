<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Depp fans take note."></head><body><p>"From Hell" is another rendition of the famous story of "Jack The Ripper". This time it's stylishly directed by two brothers, the Hughes Brothers.  This is such a different work of film from their earlier efforts, "Dead Presidents" and "Menace II Society".<p>The story of Jack the ripper is an interesting one, and it is told very well here.  It is suspenseful, creepy, and gory. However, it is also an extremely well crafted work.  The acting and directing are outstanding. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are the only names here, but overall the acting is superb. This is a must see for all Depp fans. I think this is his second best work, his first being "Blow".<br />If you have never seen any films depicting Jack the Ripper, this would be a great choice for the first.  It is a creepy old tale and it's spun really well here.<br />Johnny Depp, plays the inspector who is trying to find out who is the ripper, and he turns in a magnificent performance here.<br />He also has a full grasp of the English accent, which I was very impressed with.  He is very underrated as an actor, and I think he is one of the best actors in films.<br />This is a great vehicle for him.<br />Highly recommended!!!</p></body></html>

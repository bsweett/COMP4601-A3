But I was definitely surprised that there was a sequel. For the uninitiated, the Strause brothers are visual effects artists who make their directorial debut with Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem. Their background shows in the snippets they steal from the Aliens and Predator franchises - an APC escape here, a human mamma grizzly protecting her young there. It's like Requiem was made by people who vaguely remember only the good parts of the two original films.  The problem is that there are important aspects of the Alien and Predator movies that are completely missed here.<br /><br />The Predator known as Wolf is a "cleaner" of sorts who is summoned from the Predator home world to clean up after the Alien mess of his comrades.  So the first thing he does upon landing on Earth is to skin a hapless deputy.  Thing is, Predators have a form of honor, and the deputy doesn't so much as fire on the Predator, much less threaten it.  Skinning simply doesn't make sense - Predators do that to trophy prey, particularly prey that fights back.  The cleaner wasn't even after humanity - he's there to clean up the Alien mess, after all.  So why skin the deputy? Because that's what Predators do...right? Or at least, that's all the Strause brothers could remember from the original film.  The Aliens explode, bleeding all over the place, but there are no ill effects. Wait...Aliens have acidic blood?  The Strause brothers don't remember that either.<br /><br />Maybe you're not a diehard fan of either franchise and just want to see monsters kill each other.  Well that's too bad, because the Strause brothers, using all their visual effects skills, mask everything in darkness, rain, and shadow. The Predalien, which looks pretty goofy, is never shot in full light.  Very little can actually be seen in this film. Perhaps that's a good thing.<br /><br />In addition to not respecting the franchises and marginal special effects, Requiem is just plain mean.  Children are face-raped by a facehugger. Infants are threatened (and, mercifully, eaten off screen). A pregnant woman is violated by the Predalien as it pumps eggs down her throat into her womb. This movie is ugly in a way that doesn't add to the plot.  It's just a lame attempt to distract from how lazy this film really is.<br /><br />How lazy? Glad you asked: humans recover from life-ending wounds that killed Predators in previous films,  a power station is invented so it can be blown up, sewers are invented so they can be slogged through, and a military mom returns from a tour of duty to give her daughter nightvision goggles as a gift (?!). It's enough to make you yearn for the good old days when Paul W.S. Anderson worried about violating the continuity of the previous films.<br /><br />Nasty, brutish, and mercifully short (101 minutes), the only bigger bomb than the ridiculous nuclear blast at the end of the movie is the film itself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Deeply romantic film filled with mystery!"></head><body><p>The Illusionist and The Prestige were released in theatres in 2006 and featured 19th century magicians as their protagonists. However, the latter was backed and promoted by a major Hollywood studio while the former was a modestly budgeted independent film. As a result, The Illusionist probably didn't receive the kind of exposure it deserved. Both films also differed radically in tone. While, The Prestige focused on the rising competition between two magicians and the dangerous lengths they went to top one another, The Illusionist was a deeply romantic film about lovers separated by class.<br /><br />Edward Norton is well cast as the intensely charismatic magician. It's a wonderfully modulated performance that suggests a hint of arrogance (like when he makes Leopold look momentarily foolish during a performance) with a vulnerability that lies underneath and that Sophie's presence brings out.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is also excellent as Uhl, the audience surrogate. He narrates the film and is also a conflicted character, torn between his loyalty to Leopold and his sympathy with Eisenheim. The battle of wits between him and Eisenheim are well-played. Both are intelligent men who are very careful and meticulous in how they deal with their professions.<br /><br />The stunning Jessica Biel looks luminous in each and every shot. She's mainly known for appearing in forgettable Hollywood fluff like Summer Catch and Stealth but recently she's been trying to branch out and pick more substantial projects like Elizabethtown and Home of the Brave.<br /><br />The story of The Illusionist is deceptively simple: a love story on the surface but this is actually a bit of misdirection on director Neil Burger's part as we must pay attention to every detail.  Nothing is what it seems as he orchestrates the entire film like one of Eisenheim's illusions.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director Neil Burger. He talks about what drew him to the short story and why he wanted to make it into a movie. He also speaks intelligently about the film's themes and character motivations. This is an excellent and informative track that covers many aspects of the production.<br /><br />"The Making of The Illusionist" is a standard promotional featurette with the actors talking briefly about their characters and the story of the film with clips from the movie.<br /><br />"Jessica Biel on The Illusionist" features some of the soundbites from the previous featurette as she talks briefly about why she wanted to do this film.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="happiness equals $$$$"></head><body><p>so pursuit of happiness actually means pursuit of the dollar $$$$ sign. the i or y is not important. the correct spelling of happiness should be HAPPINE$$. but if you got mucho $$$$, don't let IRS, the real DEVIL that bible never told you clearly but definitely beyond god's control, pursuit you. because the pursuit of your $$$$ is the only happiness of the IRS.<br />will smith & son both wonderfully played the roles this movie should have. will smith definitely should be nominated as one of the best actors for an oscar. it's a very sad movie. and from the very beginning to the end, about 99% of the movie was so sad and devastate. it's not easy to watch along.<br />why the fox cried when the rabbit died? why i couldn't help thinking of those of my overdue monthly payments when i watched this movie? why i couldn't help thinking that within another month, i've got to pay income tax again, yet there's no money in my bank accounts, and i couldn't barely pay all the regular bills come every month?  where's the $$$$? where's my happiness?<br />so after six months' internship struggle, this guy finally became the chosen one and started to get paid with $$$$, so his happiness henceforth started, and once he successfully got $$$$, he got the happiness. there's nothing new there. because MONEY IS NOT EVERYTHING, IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT EQUALS HAPPINE$$!<br />why everytime when i walked out onto the parking lot, my eyes always looked down and searched every corner? yeah, i remembered that i've found $20.00 bill in some parking lot long time ago and i was so happy. since then every time when i was on any parking lot, i was always in pursuit of happiness. but so far no luck.....</p></body></html>

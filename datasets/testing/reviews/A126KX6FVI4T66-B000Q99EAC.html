<meta name="summary" content="Win by losing?"></head><body><p>This movie is about 'heart'; to take it and still fight back.<br />Boxing is a bad metaphor for it as the current legal<br />situation is a financially mediated joke with three recognized champions.<br />Most people have turned to things like kung fu, karate or kick boxing:<br />even women's boxing has more draw than a fixed or fixated heavy weight<br />fight. So why do we still see the hopes of the fighters as<br />something we will watch? Am I spoiling it by saying Rocky loses?<br />But he also delivers his message of heart and courage one more time.<br />I can't give it more than three stars because it<br />is the same old same old...with a new younger woman for love interest.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""By Grabthar's hammer, you shall be avenged!""></head><body><p>In December of 1999, director Dean Parisot unleashed what is arguably the funniest sci-fi/comedy film of all time, "Galaxy Quest", which focuses upon the dissatisfied lives of five actors who had starred in a long-cancelled sci-fi television series of the same name.  Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) played ship's captain Commander Peter Quincey Taggart.  Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver, who is no stranger to sci-fi with her roles in the "Alien" films) played Lt. Madison.  Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman, also known for his roles as Hans Gruber in the 1988 film "Die Hard" and Professor Snape in the two "Harry Potter" films) played Dr. Lazarus.  Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) played ship's engineer Tech Sgt. Chen and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) played ship's pilot Laredo.  Following the cancellation of the TV series, none of the actors had found descent acting jobs. Instead, they were relegated to appearing occasionally as their former "Galaxy Quest" characters at fan conventions and infrequent commercials.  Especially frustrated is Alexander Dane, a trained Shakespearean actor who cannot escape the stigma of having said those immortal words, "By Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged!"<p>The film begins at a "Galaxy Quest" convention where the quintet is preparing to appear.  Unbeknownst to them, not all of the conventioneers dressed as aliens are pretending.  A group of uniformed "aliens" approach Jason (dressed as Commander Taggart) saying that they are in dire need of his assistance.  Jason quickly agrees and assumes that the group is planning to pay him to appear as Commander Taggart at a fan-function.  Following a night of drinking at his home, the "aliens" arrive in a limousine (per Jason's request) to escort him to their function.  The "aliens", calling themselves Thermians, are Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), Teb (Jed Rees) and Laliari (Missi Pyle).  While en route to their function, Teb recites the lengthy history of Thermia to Jason, but Jason (who has a hangover) falls asleep.  (Jason doesn't take the Thermians seriously; instead believing that they are simply "Galaxy Quest" fans.)  Jason awakens to what he believes is a very elaborate set mimicking the NSEA Protector from the "Galaxy Quest" show. Mathesar (who always refers to Jason as Commander Taggart) tells him that the Thermians want him to negotiate a peace treaty with General Sarris (Robin Sachs).  Instead, "Commander Taggart" orders the Thermians to fire upon Sarris' ship.  Assuming that he has completed his performance, Jason tells Mathesar that he is ready to return home.  Mathesar escorts him to an empty room and leaves.  Jason, not understanding what is happening, is suddenly enveloped within a strange substance and raised to the ship's exterior where he sees millions of stars in deep space.  He is suddenly shot from the ship, then finds himself standing next to his swimming pool at home.  Jason finally realizes that the Thermians are real extraterrestrials, and that they mistakenly regard the "Galaxy Quest" show (which they received in deep space) as being historical fact.<p>The other four "Galaxy Quest" actors are busy filming a commercial for the opening of an electronics store and are disgusted because Jason isn't there.  Jason arrives late and tells them about his experience with the Thermians, but they think he has lost his mind.  Jason tells them that the Thermians want him to return and that he wants them to come also.  They initially reject it, but change their minds when they mistakenly believe that it's a paying job.  Gwen, Alexander, Fred and Tommy are whisked away to the Thermian's NSEA Protector, along with another actor named Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), who had played a bit part on the original "Galaxy Quest" show.  With that, the most important role for each of the washed up "Galaxy Quest" actors begins!<p>Dean Parisot, along with writers David Howard and Robert Gordon, created a brilliant and engaging spoof of the show "Star Trek", its conventions and trekkies with "Galaxy Quest".  Tim Allen equated with William Shatner (Kirk), Alan Rickman with Leonard Nimoy (Spock), Sigourney Weaver with Nichelle Nichols (Uhura), Tony Shalhoub with James Doohan (Scotty) and Daryl Mitchell with George Takei (Sulu).  Other sci-fi comedy spoof that predate "Galaxy Quest" (such as "Ice Pirates", "Pluto Nash" and "Spaceballs") are no where near as good, engaging or funny.<p>All of the actors in "Galaxy Quest" performed their roles exceptionally well.  Two actor who played significant minor roles were Patrick Breen, who played the Thermian named Quelleck, and Jeremy Howard, who played the young and very helpful "Galaxy Quest" fan named Kyle.<p>I highly recommend purchasing "Galaxy Quest" on DVD, which has superior picture and sound quality, and includes several deleted scenes, trailers, biographies, the feature "On Location in Space" and production notes.  "Galaxy Quest" is a film that can be watched many times while never becoming tiresome.  Sit back and remember those immortal words, "Never give up! Never surrender!" as you are whisked away into the fantastic world of "Galaxy Quest"!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Being A Gangster Not All Fun-And-Games!"></head><body><p>I found this to be an interesting character study of a Cuban who comes to Miami and becomes a big drug dealer, rising from poverty to become a wealthy big-shot....and then destroying himself. The real down side to living the life of crime is detailed in the story.  Near the end, Pacino is going to bed each night with a gun under his pillow.  Anyone who thinks being a big-time crook is "the life," should watch this film and pay attention.<br /><br />The movie got panned at the time of its release for its excesses in profanity and violence....but now since we've all become desensitized with decades of this stuff, the film is now almost reaching "cult status." Now those same flip-flop national critics like it. Amazing.<br /><br />At the time of this movie's release, Al Pacino ("Tony Montana") probably set a new Hollywood record for using the f-word in a mainline film, Now it's topped by anyone who performs in a Martin Scorcese film.  Pacino's wife, "Elvira" played by the beautiful Michelle Peiffer, wasn't a lot more clean-mouthed than her husband. She got really brutal as the film wore on.<br /><br />If that language is no problem for you, you'll find the story quite interesting and a good study of how paranoia must wind up haunting most gangsters.</p></body></html>

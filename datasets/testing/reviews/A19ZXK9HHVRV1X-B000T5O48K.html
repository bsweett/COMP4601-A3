<meta name="summary" content="goes off the rails after a promising first half"></head><body><p>**1/2<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />You can go about halfway with "Bug," William Friedkin's film version of the Tracy Letts play that had its premiere in London, then made its way across the Atlantic to New York, Chicago and Washington D.C.  It is safe to say that the source material has yielded one of the oddest American movies to come our way in quite some time.  It is certainly an example of a dual-genre gear-grinder - for what starts out as an intriguing domestic drama suddenly turns into a whacked-out paranoid thriller.  The whiplash is fairly intense at times, but the quality of the performances compensates for some, though certainly not all, of the discomfort that results.<br /><br />The wonderful Ashley Judd plays Agnes White, a divorced cocktail waitress who lives by herself in a rundown motel stuck out in the middle of the windswept desert.  On the very same night in which she invites Peter (Michael Shannon), a strange young drifter, to stay over at her place, her recently paroled, abusive ex-husband (Harry Connick, Jr.) also shows up, determined to start over with her, even if that means using strong-armed tactics to do so.  Peter, a war vet, is convinced that he has been the victim of some nefarious medical experiments at the hands of the U.S. government, experiments that involve injecting some type of bug into his bloodstream.  Soon, Agnes is sharing Peter's paranoid delusions...if they really are delusions, that is.<br /><br />There's no getting around the fact that this is one majorly schizophrenic film.  There are those who will be pulled in by the human drama of the first half but repelled by the psycho-thriller aspects that develop later on - just as there will be those who will find the earlier sections dull and talky but be intrigued by the sci-fi aspects of the second half (though I certainly don't want to discount those who'll love or hate both halves with equal fervor).  Frankly, I find myself mainly in the first camp, enjoying the movie up to the point where Peter's bug obsession completely takes over and the descent into madness begins.  In the early stages, the relationships among the various characters are complex and involving, with excellent performances from Judd, Shannon, Connick and Lynn Collins as Agnes' lesbian co-worker and friend adding to our interest.  The subtle hints of potential mental disturbance and violence (on the part of both men in her life) keep us on our guard and generate a genuine concern for Agnes' safety and well-being (emotional as well as physical).  Indeed, the quality of vulnerability that Judd brings to the role makes Agnes a very compelling character indeed.  The scenes between Judd and Shannon are particularly well-played and effective.<br /><br />Then the Big Moment arrives and the whole thing degenerates almost instantaneously into a ham-handed exercise in silliness, pretentiousness and pseudo-profundity.  Indeed, by the time the two lovers have plastered themselves into a room-sized tinfoil cocoon, you`ll probably be more than ready to check out of this particular motel for good.  It`s true that "Bug" is not quite like anything you've ever seen before, but I'm not sure that that, in and of itself, qualifies as much of a recommendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="four all-time classic movies for an unmissable price!"></head><body><p>A great space-saving alternative for those whose DVD collections are getting slightly out of hand, or an ideal gift for that special someone you know who just can't get enough classic movies!  This set focuses on four of the greatest MGM musicals.<br /><br />SINGIN' IN THE RAIN:  Arguably regarded as the greatest musical ever made, this breezy delight stars Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds in a story about the pandemonium that ensued when the "Talkies" first took over Hollywood.  Special Features: audio commentary hosted by Debbie Reynolds, and the trailer.<br /><br />EASTER PARADE: Fred Astaire came out of retirement to star opposite Judy Garland in this all-time easter favourite built around the Irving Berlin song catalogue.  Ann Miller steals the whole show with her energetic "Shakin' the Blues Away"--which she performed while still nursing a broken back!  Special Features: audio commentary by Ava Astaire McKenzie and John Fricke, and a Judy Garland trailer gallery.<br /><br />THE BAND WAGON:  Get aboard with Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse for the rollicking story of the creation of a new Broadway musical!  Special Features: audio commentary by Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein, and a Fred Astaire trailer gallery.<br /><br />MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS:  Judy Garland was never more appealing than when she played lovestruck Esther Smith in this nostalgic turn-of-the-century delight, which also boasts a winning performance from young Margaret O'Brien.  Special Features:  all-new introduction from Liza Minnelli, audio commentary by John Fricke, and a Vincente Minnelli trailer gallery.</p></body></html>

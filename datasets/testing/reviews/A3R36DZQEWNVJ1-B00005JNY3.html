<meta name="summary" content="with it's ridiculous title, The Skeleton Key is neither spectacular nor scary"></head><body><p>Kate Hudson (Almost Famous, Le Divorce) takes a caretaking job for Gena Rowlands (Taking Lives, Hope Floats) whose husband, played by John Hurt (Love and Death On Long Island, Owning Mahoney), is sick and cannot talk. What Rowlands said was he was in the attic and then he stopped. Rowlands gives Hudson a Skeleton Key which opens every single door in the place. So, Hudson gets curious as one of the doors doesnt lock but when she gets into the room she finds strange things which look like Voo Doo but then one of her friends tells her about something called Hoo Doo, which is magic spells for protection. When Hudson finds out about the history of where she's working at and some eery secrets, she explores it more. Not a bad idea, ridiculous title and what was so big about the ending anyway? Some people said that the ending was very clever....clever? I hardly call it that....I call The Skeleton Key a muddled suspense mystery...this doesnt even have any scares in it...more like laughable scare moments. Also starring Peter Sarsgaard (Jarhead, Flightplan) whose cajun accent fades a lot in this movie...not an impressive one.</p></body></html>

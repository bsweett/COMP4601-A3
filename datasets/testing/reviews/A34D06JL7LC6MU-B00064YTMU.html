<meta name="summary" content="The 2nd Best Film of 2004."></head><body><p>I've seen about 78, 2004 movies. I think the best film of the year is "Kill Bill Vo.2" and this is a close second.The performances are absolutely amazing.Jamie Foxx has been getting the best reviews for this film and I think he will be nominated<br /><br />for Best Supporting Actor for this film. But it doesn't matter,<br /><br />'cause he's probably gonna win Best Actor for "Ray". Tom Cruise gives an Oscar worthy performance but I don't think Cruise is gonna score gold this year. I just have one problem with this film. The cinematography. It's filmed a little too much like,<br /><br />I-was-there-and-got-it-all-on-tape kind of stuff. It looks to be filmed with nothing but a handheld. But,the story (by "Pirates of the Caribbean" writer Stuart Beattie) is spectacular and it's masterfully directed by Michael Mann. The film is about Max (Foxx). Max is driving a cab in an attempt to get enough money to<br /><br />open his own limo business (a dream that's going nowhere). He says it's part time, but he's been driving for 12 years. One day his luck changes when he meets a woman (Jada Pinkett Smith) and might score a date. But with good luck, comes bad luck and Max meets Vincent (Cruise). Vincent offers Max six hundred dollars to take him to six stops on "real estate business". Problem is at the first stop a body falls on top of Max's cab and Max discovers Vincent is a hit man. The two develop a sort of weird friendship along the way,but the movie is totally suspenceful and just plain terrific. Tom Cruise with his gunmetal gray hair kind of makes the movie what it is. It's his best performance since "Eyes Wide Shut". Jamie Foxx (who started off as a comedian, then came into drama with Oliver Stone's crappy<br /><br />"Any Given Sunday") gives his best performance until a few months later when "Ray" was released. But, yeah see this movie for sure. You won't regret it. A+.</p></body></html>

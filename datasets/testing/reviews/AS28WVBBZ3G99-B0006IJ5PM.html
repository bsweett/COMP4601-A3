<meta name="summary" content="Not Your Typical "Sports Film" - Extraordinary!"></head><body><p>This is not your usual David and Goliath sports film about the gritty underdogs who prove that hard work and faith will overcome all odds. Nope.<br /><br />While these kids are taught about hard work and discipline there is so much more. They learn about humility ("Don't believe your press clippings"), fading glory of high school football, ("This is the best moment of your life") and the withering, destructive nature of personal ambition and pride (It's all about Boobie").<br /><br />As a parent of high school athletes, I found too much that was distrubingly familiar. It gave me pause to remember how I had handled similar situations with my kids - and I didn't like every personal reflection I had.<br /><br />A lot of herd-hitting truth is packed into this excellent film. And a lot of hard-hitting action, too! This is a moving, powerful, and persuasive rendering of a fascinating story of high school sports in America.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Knight Versus the Joker"></head><body><p>The Good Things<br />*Some good action scenes, especially at the end.<br />*Very solid cinematography.  Seems very fresh and original.  Quite a few strong images.<br />*Pretty dark and moody, but not overwhelmingly so.<br />*Production design is completely awesome.  Gotham City is very imaginatively designed.  The Batmobile is still probably the best in this film.  The Batwing is cool.  There are loads of nifty gadgets, cool costumes, and good sets.<br />*Storyline is not too bad.  Lots of memorable scenes.  Has a good amount of drama, romance, action, and snippets of comedy.<br />*Characters are good and well-acted.  Michael Keaton is cool.  Jack Nicholson makes a good, funny, somewhat menacing Joker.<br />*Music score is good, and there are a few good late 80s songs in there (lots of Prince!).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Seems a bit long or slow in the first hour or so.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*Some parts are a little goofy (but it's not too bad in this case).<br /><br />Even though the newer Batman films are stronger in a lot of ways, this version is still quite original and entertaining.  It has good characters, a pretty good story, and some excellent production designs throughout.  The ending has a lot of great action too.  Definately reccomended for anybody who is interested in comic-book heroes.<br /><br />The one-disc version has okay image and sound quality, and no special features.  The two-disc version has good quality and a number of featurettes.</p></body></html>

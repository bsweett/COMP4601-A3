<meta name="summary" content="The Grudge has some creepy moments but it's nothing special"></head><body><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) plays Katherine, a woman who is now taking care of a what looks like a sick woman, played by Grace Zabriskie (R.S.V.P.) Now, as Gellar is putting the woman to sleep, something comes up to the side of her and shocks the hell out of her...it looks like a japanese girl..floating. Then, we get into flashbacks of when the old woman (Zabriskie) bought the house with her daughter, played by Clea DuVall (Identity) and her daughter's husband played by William Mapother (Tv's LOST). Also, Gellar finds out about a man named Peter, played by Bill Pullman (Zero Effect), as she experiences a flashback of him and finds out the secret to why this woman has such a grudge against the people. You either dig it or you dont, is my saying and I dug it to a certain point where it kinda went downhill from there. Director Takashi Shimizu rewrote this story Ju-On: The Grudge which has a lot more effective and better then this one...this one is the neutered hollywood version. Gellar costar's with actor Jason Behr (Tv's Roswell) who worked with her on one episode of Buffy, surprisingly as one of her ex-boyfriends in that episode...here, he plays her boyfriend who goes threw the grudging pains, as I like to call it. Some stuff is creepy, other stuff is kinda gets annoying like the cat meows and the rasping voice on the telephone...even the girl kinda reminds me of the girl from The Ring which blows it off, but she's a Japanese girl...I dont know, maybe the girl from The Ring and the girl from The Grudge should make a movie called Ring Girl and Grudge Girl Take A Holiday. Also starring Ted Raimi (Man with the Screming Brain), who's brother Sam Raimi (Spider-Man 1 and 2) executive produced the film. Also, Director Shimizu casts most of the actors from the Japanese movie as well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bale Brilliantly Nails The Role Of  A Narcissistic Yuppie Nut"></head><body><p>In this film version of Brett Easton Ellis' often misunderstood satiric novel, the question of Bateman's real versus imaginary deeds is answered more firmly than Ellis allowed to happen in the book. Here, seemingly, at least some if not all of Patrick Bateman's violence apparently came to pass only in the space between the sick (though impeccably fashionable) Yuppie's ears. In this flashy, stylish and yet somehow still laudably low-key adaptation of a novel once thought unfilmable, Christian Bale does  a superb job of embodying a self-loving, celebrity-obsessed, brand name worshipping billionaire playboy, who tells us in lingering detail how he just happens to slay random people in his spare time. Bale trades his native Welsh accent for a polished snooty high society American one, and his comedic narcissism is refreshing in comparison with how so many other actors would have played this daunting role. The extended "cut" of American Psycho restores some of the nudity and a little of the violence left out in the theatrical release six years ago. What has never been removed is the dark humor and blistering satire that skewers the late 1980's love of excess. Fine performances abound in American Psycho, from the always magnificent Willem Dafoe, to Reese Witherspoon as Patrick's bubble-brained fianc&eacute;e, to a downtrodden Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's loyal secretary, to Samantha Mathis as a pill popping "hotbod" whose dead-end drug addiction amuses the sadistic Bateman. Filmmaker Mary Harron, who also gave us the bleak nineties art-flick, I Shot Andy Warhol, packs a lot into the relatively short run time of this movie, and in my opinion, she did a pretty fine job with some difficult material.</p></body></html>

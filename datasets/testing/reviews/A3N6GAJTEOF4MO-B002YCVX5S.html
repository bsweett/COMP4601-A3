He's always been a man I've respected as a film maker and his collection of films sit comfortably in my list of favourite films of all time. This is one he's been working on for over a decade, refining the script to create his ultimate masterpiece that he was hoping would match the perfection of Pulp Fiction. This sincerely did not disappoint and the wait made it even more special when I got my chance to see it for the first time. Tarantino is sincerely a master of cinema and although some of his more recent films, amongst critics, are generally hit and miss, this is genuinely a masterpiece and displays the man's ability on top form once again.<br /><br />The story unfolds over 5 chapters: Once upon a time... In Nazi occupied France; Inglourious Basterds; A German Night in Paris; Operation Kino and Revenge of the Giant Face. It tells of two separate plots to assassinate Hitler at the same time and place. On the one side we have Emmanuelle Mimieux, a cinema owner with revenge in her heart as her previous name was Shoshanna Dreyfus and she is the only surviving member of her family who were murdered by SS Colonel Hans Landa. The other side focuses on a group lead by Lieutenant Aldo Raine known as the Basterds are a group of Nazi killers who just enjoy killing Nazi's until they find out about a plan to hold a propaganda film premiere in the cinema owned by Emanuelle in which the Fuehrer will be in attendance. This group of Nazi killers are determined to kill the head Nazi, but the question is, will they even get close to their goal?<br /><br />One of Tarantino's main talents is that he has an ear for intense dialogue and can create a lengthy scene which has only that and allow the viewer to be gripped throughout. This is not different as the dialogue in this film is intense and filled with dynamic mood changes and superb acting. Sure, the fact that the dialogue is heavy with subtitles, they work in setting an authentic mood and rather than having the actors play Germans or Frenchmen talking to their fellow countrymen in American accents which would diminish the mood entirely, I personally preferred the subtitles. The first scene of the movie I see it as acknowledging this possibility of subtitle overkill by having Colonel Landa request that the opposing character Perrier LaPadite switch to English as his French was exhausted. Although there was a plot justification for this switch, it was a clever and I found it to be quite a humorous aspect.<br /><br />The acting is sublime, it really is. There are moments when it is slightly camp and the stereotypical traits are a bit over -exaggerated but they add a little relief to what is quite an intense film throughout. The cast are well fitted to their roles, especially Christopher Waltz as "The Jew Hunter" Hans Landa and Brad Pitt as Aldo "The Apache" Raine. They are both comically and seriously believable in their own right and add a lot to the film individually. The talk that Waltz should gain an academy award for his role in this film is well deserved and I pray he receives that nomination and ultimately the award. The supporting cast members such as Eli Roth, Mike Myers, Diane Kruger, Melanie Laurent and Martin Wuttke add their own individual flairs to the film to make it a genuinely pleasant experience.<br /><br />There is also certainly a western movie style influence with the film and you know it's a Tarantino film the minute it begins. He has an individuality with his films that allows you to notice instantly that he had a hand in putting this masterpiece together. This is definitely an Oscar worthy film that I would strongly recommend to anybody with an ounce of respect for truly marvellous film making. For the HD fans there are the elements that take advantage of this, especially with the beautifully vibrant scenery. So get it, you will not be disappointed.</p></body></html>

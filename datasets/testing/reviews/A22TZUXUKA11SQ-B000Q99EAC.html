<meta name="summary" content="It ain't over 'til it's over"></head><body><p>Twenty seven years after his first championship fight, Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa is just living his life as a normal guy.  His wife, Adrian, is dead and he visits her grave regularly.  He hangs out with his brother-in-law, Paulie, and goes to places that remind him of his and Adrian's courtship.  He runs a restaurant, Adrian's, and walks around during dinner reliving the glory days of his fighting years with customers who like the sentimentality of it. And he's struggling to maintain a relationship with his son, whose friends call him "Little Rocky" and who desperately wants to shake off his image as Rocky Balboa's son and make a name for himself.<br /><br />The current undisputed heavyweight champion of the world is a man named Mason Dixon.  Dixon is fast, quick, and youg, but people doubt his talent because he's never really fought anyone who would prove much of a threat.  Since his victories don't seem to be much of a challenge, everyone wonders if Dixon really is worth his salt as a boxer. Then ESPN has the bright idea of staging a computer-simulated a fight between Rocky Balboa at his prime and Mason Dixon right now. This is supposed to mirror a similar fight that was once similated between Rocky Marciano and Muhammed Ali.  In this version, Balboa wins. Angered, Dixon challenges Rocky to an exhibition fight to go 10 rounds and to prove once and for all who really is the greatest.<br /><br />I have to say that in order to like this movie you have to be a fan of the original Rocky franchise. I went with one friend who, like me, was a die hard Rocky fan and another who couldn't care less. Whether or not we liked the original films was reflected in the split decision between who liked and who didn't like Rocky Balboa.  This movie was a tad bit melodramatic, but all the Rocky movies are and if you're a fan you'd know that going into it.  Regardless of whether you like the old films or not, I'd suggest rewatching the original Rocky from 1979 before going to see this movie. It's  not really necessary to see any of the sequels, but there are a lot of flashbacks and clips from the first film and I think seeing it beforehand will help put them into perspective.  Even as a longtime fan of the Rocky series, if I hadn't watched the original within the last week I'm pretty sure there were parts of this one that would have been lost on me.<br /><br />Still, as a whole, I really enjoyed this movie. It focuses a lot on Rocky's efforts to rebuild his life in the aftermath of Adrian's death.  You can tell that since she's been gone he hasn't really known what to do with himself. Going back into the ring with Dixon is his way of exorcising the demon's that have been haunting him since her death. It also allows him to get back his relationship with his son and to finally bury the past so that he can go on with his future. Melodramatic it may be, but I love Rocky and this is a fitting end to the series.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pales in comparison to actual musical - Travolta in fat-suit falls flat"></head><body><p>Perhaps it's unfair to review a film adaptation of a Broadway show shortly after seeing a first-rate live production of that show.  But that's where I found myself - my daughter and I saw a terrific live stage production and she was so excited that I had to snag the movie . . . what a disappointment.<br /><br />To be fair, the movie is a faithful adaptation of the Broadway show, which is in turn a faithful adaptation of John Water's original film version featuring Ricki Lake.  The movie is more tame than the Broadway show and much more sedate - although it's hard to see any film providing the same stand-up-and-dance exuberance as that hysterically upbeat show.<br /><br />For the most part, the cast plays their parts with good cheer and warm humor.  Nikki Blonsky takes on the key role of Tracy Turnblad, the plump and plucky Baltimore teen who wants nothing more than for everyone to dance together in harmony to the coolest tunes on the Corny Collins show.  Blonsky's got a fine voice and has the rampaging cheerfulness to play Tracy, and that's saying a lot.  Several other supporting roles, such as Amanda Bynes as Tracy's best pal and James Marsden as Corny, are well-played.<br /><br />The story also gets high marks as ever - "Hairspray" daringly takes on the racial and sexual mores of Baltimore circa 1962 - and there's lots of fodder there.  But it's hard to give a remake of a remake a lot of credit for telling an original story.  The key is whether this film version of "Hairspray" does a good job, and that's where things fall apart.<br /><br />In their zeal to sell a Hollywood hit, the filmmakers made some big casting mistakes with some of my all-time favorite actors.  John Travolta's fat-suit performance as Tracy's obese mother Edna just flat-out does not work.  Travola adopts a weird accent that, like Ben Stiller's in "Zoolander," wears out its welcome quickly.  The gimmick of "Hey, that's Travolta in a fat suit!" also wears thin as the effect is more creepy than comical.  It must be said that while Travola's performance in Greece spawned a million karaoke performances, his singing in "Hairspray" is subpar.  The movie would have been much better served if they had chosen a relative unknown from a touring production of "Hairspray" rather than finding a Big Hollywood Star brave enough to take this role on.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer fares a little better as Velma Von Tussle, as her razor-sharp cheekbones and chiseled triceps embody the evil mother's frosty competitiveness.  But she does surprisingly little with "Miss Baltimore Crabs," a disappointment.  For all her brassy talents, Queen Latifah doesn't have the singing chops to pull off Motormouth Maybelle's bring-down-the-house number, "I Know Where I've Been," a song that had the crowd alternately cheering and tearing up at the live show we attended.  Saint Christopher Walken seems to sleepwalk through much of the movie, although he does shine on his duet, "You're Timeless To Me."<br /><br />I'm not naive about Hollywood's need to bring in big names to get movies made . . . it would have been too risky from a box-office perspective if the filmmakers had chosen relative unknowns but who had brought the house down in one of the many live productions of the Broadway show.  But it would have been a much better movie.</p></body></html>

"Wouldn't it be cool if we could erase our memories?  Wouldn't that be cool?"  No.  Characters, plot, actors with a lick of talent, and dialogue that doesn't just lay there would be cool.  So would some good writing, which is notable for its total absence here.<br /><br />I did watch it all, by the way.  The girl's recording of why she was dumping Jim Carrey was good writing.  Nothing else was.<br /><br />When Jim Carrey was running around in his old memories with the metaphor for his memories of what's-her-face, did anyone have a TRON flashback?<br /><br />Really, we take one little premise and waffle and wander all over the place for over 100 minutes that seem a whole lot longer than that.<br /><br />And really, if we had mind-wiping technology, is that what we'd do with it?  Settle a spat with a guy/girl or forget a dead doggie?  If my cat left me for some other guy with a tin of tuna, I'd certainly want to remember her.<br /><br />But all that's irrelevant.  Really it's just bad, lazy, sloppy writing.</p></body></html>

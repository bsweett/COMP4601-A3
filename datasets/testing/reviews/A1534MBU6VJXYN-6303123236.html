<meta name="summary" content="The Best DVD Disney Has Ever Released"></head><body><p>The most important movie in Disney history, this 1937 gem has gotten a superb dvd treatment. Words cannot describe how flawless this dvd is. It is the best treatment I have ever seen on any dvd. I will not bore you with plot details, as everybody knows what this film is all about. I will say, however, that the film looks and sounds great. They also loaded it with extras. Dozens of documentaries, interviews and much more are littered throughout this magical I wish I could say more, but my praise for this dvd cannot be expressed in mere words. In order to see what I mean, you have to buy the dvd for yourself and see how great it is. And of course, watch the film, too. It remains a classic.</p></body></html>

It's a continuation of the original "Underworld," and picks up almost immediately where the original took off.  In it, Selene (Beckinsale) takes on her vampiric ex-allies as she seeks out more of the truth behind her betrayal.  Of course, hybrid beau Scott Speedman tags along on her quest.  This time around, her arch enemy isn't ol' Viktor from the original flick, but Marcus, son of the original necksucker, Alexander Corvinus.  Marcus is on the hunt for his brother, William, who just happens to be the baddest wolfman in the pack.  He's become such a powerful werewolf that he cannot revert to his human form.  He's also completely unable to control his aggression which means that no one's safe when Willy's on the prowl.  In order to protect his vampire family, Viktor locks William away in a seemingly impenetrable prison many centuries before this film takes place.  When Marcus is awakened by Kraven, he immediately begins his hunt to find the key that will open his brother's prison.  This leads him to both Viktor's dead body and Selene.<br /><br />Confusing enough for ya?  It really helps if you've seen the first flick in case you want to follow the plot.  Of course, plot is of little necessity in a film like this.  Action is the driving force that makes this flick watchable.  Fans of the original will recognize Lucian, Kraven, and Amelia from the original flick in brief flashback sequences and Marcus' awakening scene.  Fans of the original will also recall Selene's famous swandive manuever which is done repeatedly in this sequel.<br /><br />I have to admit that I prefer this flick to the original.  It has more action, a swifter pace, and for once, the werewolves and vampires actually use their supernatural strengths to do battle.  Gunplay fans be not afraid, there are just as many bullets flying in "Evolution" as there were in the original flick.<br /><br />The cast is anchored by the wonderful Derek Jacobi as Alexander Corvinus.  Unfortunately he isn't given much to work with here.  Tony Curran portrays sinister son, Marcus.  Thankfully, he has more than a few words to work with here.  He plays his character to perfection.  The rest of the cast does a fairly solid job.<br /><br />The special effects are pretty good here, though the werewolf transformations get tiring to watch after awhile.  The CGI is very obvious through most of this flick.  Think "Van Helsing" with a little more blood and a lot more atmosphere.  Marcus' wings, which have been mentioned by other reviewers, are pretty cool to watch in action, but watching people get impaled by a wing can also get old after awhile.<br /><br />If you enjoy action, "Evolution" is worthy of four stars.  If you're more into plot-driven drama, this film is only deserving of three stars.<br /><br />Enjoy it for what it is, an action-thriller with plenty of explosions and gore, a brief bit of nudity, and whigged-out werewolves and vampires.</p></body></html>

I can comment only on the movie as a movie, as I am unfamiliar with the series. I can say that, by its look, the film is faithful to its comic book origins.<br /><br />As a movie, "Van Helsing" is a handsome product, which like director Stephen Sommer's other big hits, "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns", suffers from too much reliance on computer generated special effects. The opening, a homage to Universal Studio's horror films of the 1930s, is glorious. The introduction to the anti-hero Van Helsing is also intriguing. Here is a man who doesn't know who he really is and who is a pawn of the Catholic Church. His is an interesting conflict.<br /><br />The movie proceeds to Romania, circa 1890. It's a country in turmoil, its people ruled by fear and superstition. And why not? Vampires and werewolves abound.<br /><br />Van Hesling [High Jackman] is dispatched by the Church to Romania to finally take care of the nasty Count Dracula. There he meets the amazing Anna [Kate Beckinsdale], a princess whose family Dracula [Richard Roxburgh] has been trying to destroy for centuries.<br /><br />For the most part, "Van Helsing" is good fun. It's a great adventure. What bogs it down is the special effects. Initially, they are interesting. The problem is that these effects go on and on and on. This causes the movie to run at least thirty minutes longer than the story requires. The movies "Van Helsing" pays homage to ran anywhere from seventy to ninety minutes. "Van Hesling" itself runs one hundred and thirty minutes, mainly because it insists on running the same `cool' special effects over and over again. [Note to Hollywood: Less is more.]</p></body></html>

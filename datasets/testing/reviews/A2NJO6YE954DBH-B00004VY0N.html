<meta name="summary" content="You never know what events are to transpire to get you home"></head><body><p>At some point in the publicity surrounding the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot; I had occasion to hear the real Jim Lovell say the word's &quot;Houston we have a problem&quot; that signaled to NASA that a routine mission to the moon had become a life and death situation.  If you did not know what Lovell was saying I doubt that you would be able to tell any difference in his tone from anything else he said during the mission.  With that baseline in my mind every time I have watched &quot;Apollo 13&quot; since then I have been aware that Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon as astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are a lot more emotional then than their real world counterparts.  However, that does not take away from my enjoyment of this film.<p>When I was in the first grade when my father was stationed in Orlando, Florida, we would go outside and watch the Mercury missions take off from Cape Canaveral.  We were in Japan when Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, an event that we were able to watch on Japanese TV.  So the idea that going to the moon was &quot;routine&quot; is inherently offensive and I easily picture a universe in which Fate cripples Apollo 13 as reminder to humanity not to take sending men to the moon in a small capsule for granted.  <p>The best part of Ron Howard's film takes place on earth as the NASA team headed by Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) has to deal with the disaster and the potential of losing the crew.  When one of the adminsitrators declares that this could be the worst disaster NASA has ever faced, Kranz insists, &quot;With all due respect, sir, I believe this is gonna be our finest hour.&quot;  Indeed, watching NASA literally true to figure out how to get a square peg into a round hole is the most captivating part.  After the explosion cripples Apollo 13 the three astronauts spend most of their time waiting in their freezing lunar module for the few times when they can actually do something while former crew member Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), pulled from the mission because he was exposed to measles, tries to figure out how to turn on the capsule's power without using too many amps (Stop and think about how weird that is to have as a tense situation).<p>The space shuttle disasters with &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; are a subtext for this movie because those two times there was nothing NASA could do.  By the time they knew there was a problem, the astronauts were gone.  This time, there is things that can be done, and despite all the rocket scientists running around the place, it is good old fashion American problem solving that matters here.  As Kranz says at one point, &quot;I don't care about what anything was DESIGNED to do, I care about what it CAN do,&quot; and there is a sense in which NASA jury rigs a final solution.<p>Kathleen Quinlan plays Marilyn Lovell, the wife who has to suffer while her husband's mission is ignored (the networks will not show the crew's television broadcast) and then as the entire word waits to see if he and his crewmates are going to die in space.  However, the bit role I like is Jean Speegle Howard as Blanch Lovell, Jim's mom.  Blanch is in a retirement home and is not always clear on what is going on; when Marilyn assigned Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to distract her from the worst predictions of disaster on television as Apollo 13 heads back to earth she wonders if they work with her son.  But when Marilyn and the kids first tell her about what is happening with the mission and she notices her granddaughter is scared, she tells her: &quot;Don't you worry. If they could get a washing machine to fly, my Jimmy could land it.&quot;<p>Much was made about what the cast and crew went through to make &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; during zero-G dives in an aircraft containing a capsule set to film the weightlessness scenes.  But as much as the film and the story about technology, both really come down to the human beings.  Harris and Quinlan were both nominated for their supporting roles and the film was up for Best Picture, but was one of those rare nominees that directed itself (i.e., Howard was not nominated) and won Oscars for Film Editing and Sound.  If you watch &quot;From the Earth to the Moon,&quot; produced by Hanks, you will find the episode of Apollo 13 takes a different tack from both this movie and the rest of that series that is rather interesting as well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Sick Movie Which Is Supposed To Be "A Psychological Thriller"!"></head><body><p>This movie is a pathetic attempt to create a so called "Psychological Thriller" without giving the motivations and in depth character analysis of the people involved. All you have left is two guys chained up in a grimy public restroom talking ad infinitium and ad nauseaum about every little detail they can think of. This movie is suppoed to have a "Twist In The Tale 'accordingthe the blurb on the DVD cover but I saw (no pun intended) it coming a mile off.I give this movie 5 stars because they must have paid Danny Glover a lot of money to once again play "Action Man Super Cop"</p></body></html>

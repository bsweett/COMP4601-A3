Yes, it was when I wholly realized just how `adlibbed' the majority of this film was that its genius really sunk in for me.  What Sacha Baron Cohen achieves here is not to be taken lightly.  This is a brilliantly composed slice of comedic pie; a hilarious riot that is all the more hysterical thanks to the way in which it was created.<br /><br />Like I stated in my review title; the man that duped America got the last laugh.<br /><br />In `Borat', Cohen portrays the fictitious character of Borat Sagdiyev, a man living in Kazakhstan who ventures to the United States (The U.S. and A) to learn experiences to further benefit his own country.  He takes along with him a fat guy and a cameraman to help document his journey.  He arrives in New York, visits News Stations, gets an etiquette coach, talks to feminist groups and then falls in love with Pamela Anderson while watching Baywatch and sets of on a nationwide adventure to find her in California.  On his journey he buys a bear to protect his from Jews, nearly insights a riot at a rodeo, finds himself partying with frat boys and gays, winds up being healed by some holly-rollers and tries to kidnap Pamela Anderson by throwing a sack over her head while attending her book signing.<br /><br />The fact that 90% of this isn't staged is just amazing.<br /><br />`Borat' is not a film for all.  In fact, many will find this highly offensive.  Even if you love this film you will most likely still find it highly offensive, which is part of its charm.  Cohen is a revelation here.  If is no surprise that he was inches from an Oscar nomination here (he's the only actor to win any award that year outside of Whitaker and Gosling) and he really should have gotten one; he's that inspired in his comedic approach.  He never once breaks character, which would have been hard for anyone to do while carrying around a plastic bag full of your own feces while attending a dinner party.  I just wish I had been one of the people on the subway the day he let that chicken loose.<br /><br />This movie is brilliant.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="comedy with a heart."></head><body><p>The pending nuptials of a young woman brings her friends together as her bridesmaids, and hilarity ensues. The film's star is her maid of honor, who has man issues, and a rivalry with one of the other women of the wedding party. I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. The humor does contain some raunchiness, but it is not overdone.  There are legitimate laugh out loud moments in this one, but the strength of the film is its heart. Relationship issues are dealt with, quite often with laughter, and there are several talented comedic actresses here, all bringing something different to the table. I could have done without the bathroom gross out scene, but otherwise Bridesmaids is an unexpected treat.</p></body></html>

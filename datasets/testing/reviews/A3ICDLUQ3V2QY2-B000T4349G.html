<meta name="summary" content="X-Files Redux"></head><body><p>The Forgotten starts off with an interesting premise--a bereaved mother who finds everyone forgetting about her son--and progresses to some moments of great tension, but ultimately is a disappointment.<br /><br />The look of the movie is vintage X-Files, with its gritty realism and its hand-held camera work.  The visual texture of the film reflects the emotional progression of our heroine, Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore).  However, it also tries to bring us in on the director's mindset.  I agree that Moore is a beautiful woman, but the long lingering shots of her face and body slow down the progression of the plot.<br /><br />Paretta is accompanied in her effort to weed out her frustration by Ash Correll (Dominic West), who loses the memory of his daughter but then recovers it.  Ash is an interesting character, but the enforced sexual tension between him and Paretta is distracting and, since nothing ever comes of it, a red herring on the part of writer Gerald Di Pego and director Joseph Rubin.<br /><br />These leads are supplemented with a million-dollar supporting cast, including Anthony Edwards, Alfre Woodard, Robert Wisdom, and Gary Sinese.  All the actors work hard to create a careful and nuanced ensemble performance, and I really enjoyed watching them.  However, they all seem to be held hostage to the tender mercies of the script, which doesn't relent an inch.<br /><br />For example, in an attempt to frustrate Paretta's investigation of why everyone forgot her son, they also wipe away her marriage.  Her husband has no idea who she is.  But the police investigation he initiated on her behalf continues.  Why?  Because the plot demands it.<br /><br />The plot demands are unforgiving to the characters.  There are three major twists in the story.  I saw two of them less than fifteen minutes into the story, but the third, having to do with Sinese as Paretta's psychiatrist, came so far out of left field and was so unearned that, at a key moment when I should have been powerfully empathic with these characters, I only wanted to jeer.<br /><br />There are also a lot of scares in this movie.  In this way, as with others, it tries to mimic the success of the X-Files.  But rather than building on creeping dread or a fear of the unknown, the scares are based on jolts and shoults of "Boo!"  I jumped several times as I was watching, but I doubt if I went back and saw this film a second time that I'd be particularly flustered.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie was that it seems to have been transplanted from another script.  Or several.  With the flexing of reality around our protagonist, I kept expecting Hugo Weaving to appear around the corner and growl, "Mr. Anderson..."  And with the number of men in black, I was waiting for the one rogue, played by David Duchovny, to try and unseat them.<br /><br />This movie isn't out-and-out bad.  It has a good underlying premise, an engaging look, and characters we genuinely want to care about.  But the movie is hostage to the writer and director, who seem to want the audience to react so specifically that they're not above manipulating the world of the film to get that.<br /><br />Wait for the DVD to come out with this one--it's good, but not good enough to justify the steep price of theater tickets.</p></body></html>

Like books, video games are a different sort of medium and when turned into movies are usually nothing more than cool bad movies. With that said, I was really surprised by RESIDENT EVIL.  I had never played the video game, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The movie uses film techniques and cliches borrowed from a host of other films, e.g. THE MATRIX, ALIENS, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD just to name a few. Yet, the movie sucked me in. I was enthralled by it. I got caught up in the action and the story and kept wanting it to go on.<p>There isn't much dialogue here and therefore the acting is limited to physical reactions, facial expressions, body movement, and action sequences. The movie starts off slow and confusing with the seemingly hodge-podge of scenes not making any sense. However, once the background to the film is given and after a few flashbacks are seen, things begin to fall into place.<p>The movie is classified as a horror movie. However, it's really more of an action/adventure or sci-fi movie with a little gore and for a horror movie the gore is rather tame.<p>I've read a lot of mixed reviews about people who have played the game. Some say it strays from the games plot, while others say (with the exception of character changes) stays pretty close to the original video game. I don't know. However, I do know that I really didn't think I would like this movie, but I ended up liking it and was thoroughly entertained for 90 minutes.</p></body></html>

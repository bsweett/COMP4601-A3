<meta name="summary" content="They should really Terminate the franchise after this"></head><body><p>I decided to rent it first because I wasnt 100% sure about if this movie was any good.<br />In my humble opinion, this didnt hold a candle to the first 2 Terminator movies..it was flat. Completely flat. Like watching a blank TV screen for 2 hours.<br />It lacked any of the ingredients that made the first 2 superior films. Even the 3rd Terminator film was better than this dribble. The film really just dragged for me and didn't have enough plot or story to hold my interest. This was another 2009 movie that spends a lot for explosions but zero on characterization. The characters were unlikeable & just bland to show any real interest. Who knew John Connor would be a boring/bland character as an adult ?<br />Sure there are a few moments with the Terminator robots going after the characters (what was Christian Bale thinking??) but it wasn't much. It was a whole lot of nothing going on. Even the naked "Schwartzenegger" Terminator running around trying to kill Connor wasn't anything special<br />Arnold Schwarzenegger may not be that great a governor but at least the Terminator movies he did had substance, a good story and a director who knew what it takes to make a good science fiction futuristic story with characters to root for a care about. If they make another Terminator film it should be directed by James Cameron in other words.<br />I would only see it if you like the Terminator series & are curious to see this one.<br />They shouldn've really stuck at 2 to be blunt..</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CITIZEN KANE: The ultimate DVD to own as a film lover!!!!"></head><body><p>What struck me most while finally seeing CITIZEN KANE (as the only person probably in filmdom who had not!) was that the story of Kane I could trace in the lives of so many other high-powered moneyed public figures even to this current day! Newspapers still can control what we think and how we perceive "reality";newspapers still intentionally slander and try to discredit in order to control public opinion (now, even certain television stations!);how rich folk attempt to  control the movements of the rest of us and make us think that they really identify with us;how public persona and private lives are often diametrically opposed;how careers can be made with the sure and certain influences of wealthy people;how political office is often something to which they aspire......but most importantly,just how much these people are scared little children in need of their mommies and daddies and their sled!!!!!!<br /><br />This film says it all.Yes this film is a marvel in cinematic technique etc,etc.etc,but for me it is the timeless message of the corruptibility of the average citizen resulting from the lack of early essential childhood needs being provided.That this story was based "loosely" on the life of mogul William Randolph Hearst almost seemed irrelevant to me as a million more "Hearsts" have come and gone and still are here in my own lifetime.<br /><br />With the upcoming elections within a year, I am glad to have CITIZEN KANE for my very first time.This film only continued to confirm what I have always believed:that ultimate power corrupts ultimately (someone else said that first!).If ever a film was made to expose people for what they are and to aid an already cynical nature, then I am glad to have made CITIZEN KANE that most agreeable choice!<br /><br />The extras on this DVD, a two hour film on how Hearst tried to destroy Wells and the film is priceless. ANY serious moviegoer needs this DVD in their collection.What you learn about the film process and corruption in the industry is worth every minute of your time.I will never view films quite the same way as I have thanks to this film.ALL REVIEWERS ON AMAZON-ATTENTION!!!!-GET THIS!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Fun and Enjoyable!"></head><body><p>I just bought this movie yesterday and saw it for the first time last night. It started off a bit slow, but once the scams began so did the fun. Most people including me thought it was going to be a light-hearted comedy/drama due to the previews, but it really is more of a serious drama with some very sad moments. Don't get me wrong, the movie is a lot of fun and the 2 hour and 15 minute running time flys by. Leonardo Dicaprio finally finds a role that helps him to shine as an upcoming actor, and Tom Hanks is great as always as the serious cop who is on his trail. Another thing worth noting is that the costumes and soundtrack are stunning, and they time warp you back to the mid-60's. If you want an enjoyable movie with a touch of serious drama thrown into the mix, rent or buy this movie now!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very good movie gets pretty good Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>First, the movie:<br /><br />Oliver Stone delivers not a scathing expose, but instead a relatively nuanced portrait of a character. As he says in the commentary, he is as much a humanist as he is a film director. George W. Bush doesn't wake up in the morning thinking "I'm a bad guy." So Stone sees his job as painting as accurate and true a portrait of a character as possible, one which is both true internally as far as motivation as it is true externally in terms of results. I think he achieves this goal in "W."<br /><br />He is aided by some truly wonderful performances. Josh Brolin is great as Bush. Toby Jones is a creepy, terrific Karl Rove, and Richard Dreyfuss is a revelation as Dick Cheney.<br /><br />Also very helpful is good, crisp writing, and a surprisingly brisk pace. Stone's movies usually top 3 hours - this one clocks in at two. And while there are some condensed and created scenes, Stone takes pains to point out that he has citations and sources for everything, if not the exact moment being portrayed, then for the characterization of people and moments in the "composite scenes." The disc contains an annotation section which lists sources, kind of like a scholarly article.<br /><br />In the end, this movie is entertaining as a character study, and as a study of the effects this kind of character has in our kind of society. We live in a nation which has lost its appreciation for wisdom - and is brimming with rich dullards who have the power to take it over. In such a climate, we are subject to the whims of the character of the people who find themselves in power - and I think Stone has hit the nail on the head by pinpointing the flaws in Bush's character which led to the various catastrophes of the years 2001-2008. You might disagree with this or that based on your politics, and you might reject the thesis of the movie. But I think you'd have a hard time faulting this *as* a movie. Stone knows how to keep a viewer's attention, how to create a scene, and he has all of his powers at his command in "W.", much as he did with other recent films such as "World Trade Center."<br /><br />Now, as for the Blu-Ray:<br /><br />This is a solid if unspectacular transfer. It looked pretty much identical to the theatrical presentation. Detail can be strong in spots, especially with faces and cloth textures, but this is not the disc you'll pop in to show off your system. I will say, I appreciate the fine film grain which is present throughout - this movie was thankfully not scrubbed clean by DNR.<br /><br />Extras include a fine commentary track by Stone. It's a tad dull in spots, but he does a very good job presenting his case for why he made this movie the way he did, and his general thesis in doing so. Deleted scenes are presented in 1080i with optional commentary. Two documentaries, one about the film and one on "W" himself, round out the special features. Overall, it's a fine batch of features.<br /><br />Quite annoying are promos at the beginning of the disc which each must be skipped individually. I'd like to find the people that sell movie companies on this idea, ring each and every one of their doorbells, and present them an unskippable knuckle sandwich right in their stupid monkey faces. I can't imagine a more irritating way of punishing someone who has paid good money to own your film.<br /><br />If I were just rating the movie, I might be tempted to give it five stars. It isn't as epic as a film like Stone's "Nixon" or "Alexander," but then, the subject matter isn't as epic as those men, either. If you are a fan of Stone's, the disc is a no-brainer. It's a very watchable movie with a lot of replay and entertainment value. Political history buffs also likely will get a kick out of it. This might not be the movie to get that religious conservative Blu-Ray buff you know. So, given the film's strengths, the average HD transfer, the decent extras, and the annoying trailers, I say 4 stars all around.</p></body></html>

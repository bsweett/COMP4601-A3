<meta name="summary" content="Adult Revelation"></head><body><p>Nicolas Cage seems to grab juicy, serious parts for his roles.  With teens flocking to see slocky special effects, there are fewer thoughtful films for the forty and up to see.  Cage in Adaptation and later Matchstick Men carries the flag for adult revelation movies.<br /><br />These types of film show the protagonist's messy life.  The revelation that your existence has hit a wall is usually catalyzed by an unusual event, for an example, Cage's 14 year-old daughter he has never seen has suddenly arrived in the midst of con-man shenanigans.  All hell breaks lose during a caper, and retro father-Cage has to make some mature decisions.  If I described the trick ending, and there is a trick ending, there would be a spoiler alert, but this film isn't so much a film about tricky cons, it's a revelatory of personality atrophy.<br /><br />Matchstick Men plays a little slow at times with good acting and fair-to-good swindle surprises.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="That's Graysmith. He's a cartoonist. He thinks he's going to solve the Zodiac"></head><body><p>Zodiac is an excellent movie that is successful on many levels. First, it tells a true-life crime story about a sensational serial murderer that galvanized the public, and was ultimately never solved. Second, it tells how the author of the book upon which the film was based was caught up in trying to solve the case while working as a cartoonist at The San Francisco Chronicle. Third, it tells the devastating effect this had on him and his family, and also on the police and reporters and their families. Fourth, it questions the role of media in cases like this--does the press coverage reward the killers with fame and notoriety? Does the press help or hinder the police? Fifth, it shows the need for different police jurisdictions to collaborate and share information.<br /><br />To accomplish these various goals it had a tight ensemble cast led by Jake Gylenhaal as Robert Graysmith; with strong performances from Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery, a reprobate reporter; Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi, a police detective assigned to the case; Chlo? Sevigny, as Graysmith's long suffering wife; Jimmi Simpson (Lyle the Intern on Letterman), as one of Zodiac's surviving victims; along with Anthony Edwards (ER), Dermot Mulroney (The Thing Called Love), James LeGros (Bad Girls), Candy Clark (American Graffiti), and John Carroll Lynch.<br /><br />Special effects were used unobtrusively to enhance the film without distracting from the story, for instance, when they were unable to film on a particular street in San Francisco, they filmed on a soundstage, but dropped the actual street in as background, blending it flawlessly. Another establishing shot shows the Transamerica Pyramid being built with time-lapse photography. Though some special effects were used, they never got in the way.<br /><br />The film had a very realistic look. Scenes in the Chronicle were exactly as I remembered the place. All the locations looked totally accurate. As the film was based on real events, there was meticulous attention to detail. Though the friendship between Paul Avery and Graysmith was fictionalized, there is a disclaimer that informs the viewer of that fact. From that I gathered that most of the other details, the ones that pertained to the Zodiac murders, were very accurate. This is so important in this sort of true crime story because  a man is being accused of murder. The filmmakers are presenting a case, though largely circumstantial, that a man is guilty of multiple murders. The temptation for the filmmakers is to fabricate evidence, in the name of poetic license, or just to make a more compelling film. All the loose ends must be tied up before we can roll credits.<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Robert Graysmith: Just because you can't prove it doesn't mean it isn't true.<br />Dave Toschi: Easy, Dirty Harry.<br />==============<br /><br />Graysmith also wrote a book about the unsolved murder of Robert Crane. That book was also made into a movie--called Auto Focus, and directed by Paul Schrader. That book also presented a suspect that the author believed had done the crime, though in the case of Robert Crane there was finally a trial where the man Graysmith suspected was charged. After so many years, it was hard to find evidence or credible witnesses. He was found not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. As for Zodiac, you'll just have to watch the film, as I am not about to spoil the film by revealing the ending.<br /><br />The bottom line is Zodiac was a very good film that accomplished what it set out to do. It didn't dwell on the violence, but showed just enough to tell the story. It presented a very solid case for the identity of Zodiac, but didn't seem to manufacture evidence out of whole cloth. The story was just as much about what Graysmith, the reporters, and the police went through to keep their families together and not go insane as it was about the puzzle of solving a murder mystery. It also raised provocative questions about the role of media in reporting crimes. That it managed to do all this wisely and fairly and still be entertaining is quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Robert Graysmith: I... I Need to know who he is. I...

<meta name="summary" content="Not for young kids"></head><body><p>Not that I am export at how old a kid should be to see movies, but I looked up the Movie Mom, and she has for the aduiance for this movie at 10 and up, so I guess in her eyes a 9 year old is still to you for this movie, now I am to old for the Movie Mom, but I might use her as a refence on movies like this if I have kids, so I am not a parent so I wouldn't breg that I know these sort of films, but I guess that older kids that can handle the Harry Potter movies, can handle this movie. But really decisons like this, should really be best to be left up to parents, since they know thier kids better, and they know what they can handle.<br /><br />Now including the end credits, the movie runs 2 hours and 22 minutes, and not 2 hours and 15 minutes like the disc of this movie says, and I might bet the tape says about the same thing. And how do you just like the title The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Andrew Adamson who co-directed the Shrek movies directed this movie. And will also direct the sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian that will be set for release in 2008, so this might be a good start for a good series, but we have to wait and see. When the movie begins, 4 kids  Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes),  and Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley), are sent from thier home to a professor's (Jim Broadbent) house, which he lives with housekeeper, that is sent to meet the kids, and warns them off the rules and not to disburb the professior. They play a game of hand and seek, and Lucy discovers a warobe, that on the other side takes her to the country of Narnia. And on her arrival she meets a faun, Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). And she goes to his house with him, and joins him for tea, where they have a visit, along the way she manges to escape from the White Witch (Tilda Swinton). And she returns to the prefissor's home, where she notices her brothers and sister are still playing, and have not even noticed that she was missing. She tells them off her visit to the country, and of course they don't beleive her. But in time, she mangers to gets Edmund to the wardob, and gets him to follwo her into and into Naria, where he meets the witch, that he assumes is a queen, and she tells him that she wants to meet the rest of them. And really before you know it, all 4 kids ends up going into the warob, and in the country of Naria, where they have to get the help of the returning Lion King Aslan ( Liam Neeson), to defeat the witch, and return Narnia to its glory that it has lost.</p></body></html>

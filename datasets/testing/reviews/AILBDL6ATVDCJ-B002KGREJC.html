<meta name="summary" content="Unbelievable Dialogue, Cool Cast"></head><body><p>Sorry folks, but I don't consider this movie to be the kind of work that has reality in play.<br /><br />Yes, Juno is funny and entertaining, but the main character's dialogue is too polished, too witty, and too "written down" to make the movie anything near believable.<br /><br />Pregnant teenagers can be witty, just not all the time!<br /><br />I write a teen column for a living; it is almost absurd for anyone to believe Juno offers a sincere look at real life.  The issues the young lady has to deal with are SERIOUS, SCARY, and NOT SO POLISHED.<br /><br />Is this a DVD I plan to purchase?  Yes.  Is this a DVD that I think everyone should own?  Absolutely not.  This movie is one of the most overrated movies to come out in a while.<br /><br />It's good, bit it ain't THAT good.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Get Hitched!"></head><body><p>A "date doctor" helps a loser get the girl, but can't help himself get one. Kevin James steals the show in this one, if you like King of Queens check it out, he plays the same character with a different name.<br /><br />I thought all the "deep advice" on how to get a woman was kind of funny and over the top some of the time. I hope no young men out there buy this movie so they can learn how to pick up women. I can help them with that.<br /><br />To get a woman follow three steps:<br /><br />1) Buy a Ferrari<br /><br />2) Be seen in your Ferrari<br /><br />3) Enjoy all the women that you will spend time with.<br /><br />I give this movie 4 stars because it started a bit slow and was a bit too chick flick in spots. Plus, a bit of nudity would have helped.</p></body></html>

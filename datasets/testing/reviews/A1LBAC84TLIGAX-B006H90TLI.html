<meta name="summary" content="AN ENTERTAINING AND COMPELLING MOVIE  8.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>I enjoyed No Country For Old Men, it was an entertaining and compelling film, but it was flawed at the same time. So, I would have to disagree with Roger Ebert's proclamation that this film is flawless. This film has a lot to offer to people who have a dedicated taste in movies and who don't get bored easily.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A drug deal in Texas goes sour, drug dealers end up dead. Then a man discovers the crime scene, and takes some things he shouldn't have (Some guns and $2 million in drug money). After he takes this money he sets off a deadly game of kill-or-be-killed when the killer comes back for the money and discovers it's gone. He hunts the man who took the money and won't let up, and even kills anyone who gets in his way to finding this man.<br />MUSIC: There is no music, it's like watching an Albert Hitchcock film. This is one of the reasons I find the movie to be flawed is the complete absence of music.<br />ACTION: This film can be suspenseful, bloody, and just downright violent. There are quite of few shooting scenes as well, which adds to great action.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: Usually this film is quite entertaining, but sometimes the dialogue goes on for toooo long (The coin toss scene is the biggest one). This film has its share of satisfying, suspenseful, and surprising moments of violence, but then I can't help but get pissed at the terrible ending (You don't end a movie like that, dammit!). You will enjoy this film if you have fairly decent taste in movies, but be warned of the long dialogue and bad ending.<br />OVERALL: If you're not sure about it, rent it first. This film caters to more specific tastes in movies, so be warned.<br />THE GOOD: Good bloody action, suspenseful scenes, and quite a few surprising moments.<br />THE BAD: Awful ending, no music.</p></body></html>

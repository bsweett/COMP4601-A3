<meta name="summary" content="Unengrossing and bizarre, yet very worthwhile"></head><body><p>Eleven years after their mega-hit "Titanic," Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite for "Revolutionary Road," released in January, 2009. Kate has shed her unappealing baby fat and is now a curvy beauty, whereas Leonardo is definitely a man and no longer has that boyish vibe.<br /><br />"Revolutionary Road" is a drama about a couple with two kids living in the suburbs of Connecticut in the '50s. Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) marches off to the big city five times a week, ten hours a day, to a job he hates, whereas April (Kate) takes care of things on the home front, including their hardly-seen children. Kate's dream of being an actress has failed and she vents her frustrations on Frank. Feeling emasculated, Frank has a meaningless affair to prove his manhood to himself. Meanwhile April comes up with a wild idea for them to move to Paris because Frank's war tales describe it as a place of total exhilaration and April desperately wants Frank to regain that aura of vitality he had when they first met. Will they escape the miserable corner they've painted themselves into or will they join the masses of living dead in their midst?<br /><br />I enjoy a good drama now and then, like the excellent "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DN0V02">Snow Angels</a>," the potent "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056BSJ">Grand Canyon</a>" or the masterpiece "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305144168">Dead Poets Society</a>," but "Revolutionary Road" fails to achieve the greatness of those films, mainly because the characters and their story are fairly boring. The film's just not that engrossing, which is my main criteria for evaluating any flick.<br /><br />Yet it does have some glimpses of greatness. For one, the movie possesses a very real bizarreness that's hard to explain. Seriously, this is easily one of the most slyly offbeat dramas I've ever seen. Secondly, Michael Shannon as John Givings, the mentally disturbed son of the real estate lady (Kathy Bates), is a fascinating character. Everyone else in the Wheeler's lives thinks their plans to give up their surburban paradise are crazy. Big surprise. But John sees the brilliance and necessity of the plan. In other words, the only person who 'gets' the plight of the Wheelers is this nigh-insane dude. But he's not really insane. John is gifted at seeing through a facade to get to the core of a matter, the awesome or awful truth. And he has no inhibitions about speaking his mind, good or bad. At heart, John is a beatnik, the 50's precursor to the hippie. He represents the first wave of the 60's counter-culture, a generation of youth who discerned the cracks in the post-war "paradise," and spit on it, for better or worse.<br /><br />The film raises some important questions: Is life just having a marriage, a family, a well-paying job (you loathe) and a nice home in the pleasant suburbs, plus cigarettes and drinks without end? Or is their more? What about love? What about genuineness? What about unrealized, unused or ignored talents and dreams? What about (gasp) God?<br /><br />"Revolutionary Road" has some other positives: it's expertly made, has a good score by Thomas Newman and evokes some haunting moments.<br /><br />The film was shot in Connecticut & NYC and runs almost 2 hours.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Because of the unengrossing characters and story, I can only give "Revolutionary Road" a strong 3 Stars or C+. But I can see why others rate it higher because it does have flashes of greatness and it definitely makes you reflect on its themes. In some ways, the same message is addressed in "Dead Poets Society" (and "Grand Canyon" to a lesser extent) -- rejecting the box society tries to confine you, throwing caution to the wind, and going after your dreams -- the difference is that "Dead Poets Society" (and "Grand Canyon") accomplished this with a captivating story whereas "Revolutionary Road" doesn't. Generally speaking, that is.<br /><br />But this is a film that might be better on repeat viewings. We'll see. I'll be sure to adjust my rating if it is.<br /><br />In any event, it's definitely worth catching if these themes trip your trigger.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best trilogies in HD glory!!!"></head><body><p>I have to say that I only recently saw Back to the Future and inmediately it turned as one of my favorite movies. After watching it, I bought the entire trilogy and the results are awesome!!!.<br /><br />Back to the Future (1985):<br />BTTF is a great film because it has a lot of elements in the right place. It's funny, the cast is impeccable, the premise is original and smart, is really entertaining and the friendship between Doc and Marty feels genuine giving the movie a heart. Zemeckis accomplished a film that in other hands could've been a complete mess but here, it's completely unerstandable and not hard to follow. BTTF is a truly classic that has stood the test of time and is my favorite of the trilogy. Simply a masterpiece.<br /><br />Back to the Future part II (1989):<br />Sequels, as we know are dangerous propositions that can either expand the story in glourious ways or sink it in the deep bottom of oblivion. Fortunately, BTTF2 is not the case of a bad sequel and indeed it expands the story in interesting ways. The movie has a lot of elements that made the first so good but also it complicates things more and takes the adventure to new levels. We go to the year 2015, an alternate 1985 and we go back again to 1955. The special effects are really good, although some of them seem dated by today's standards. Still, the story is really good and keeps you involved the whole time. The cast as always is impecable and it is also worth noting that this is the darkest film of the three.<br /><br />Back to the Future part III (1990):<br />The third film in a trilogy is usually the worst one. But sometime is always the best (TS3), in this case BTTF3 is not the best of the three but is still really good and concludes the trilogy in a high note. The movie is lighter than the previous one and a little bit more entertaining too. The western setting is spectatucar and surprinsingly it works really well. The characters of Marty and Doc Brown end as full rounded characters and in the case of Doc Brown we see him in a completely new perspective. This movie is full of humor, romance and great action sequences. It is really high quality entertainment.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />All three BTTF films were given full restorations with impressive results. The image in all three is clear, crisp, full of contrast and detail. Skin tones are mostly natural and grain is visible though not annoying. Sometimes the image looks a little soft but that's because of the techniques that they used to film them. A faithful and outstanding tranfer for all of them. Thank you Universal.<br /><br />In the audio department, all three films feature 5.1 DTS-HD MA and the results are great. Dialogue is crystal clear, the music sounds clear and there is no sign of hissing or other annomalies. A great audio presentation.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />This package is full of bonus material spread across the three discs. The most note-worthy is a six part new documentary newly created for this set that are called "Tales from the Future" spread across the three movies. In the first movie you have "In the Beginning...", "Time to Go" and "Keeping Time". In the second movie you have "Time Flies" and in the third you have "Third Time's the Charm" and "The Test of Time". This six-part documentary is incredible as all the people involved in the making of the films discuss everything that was done with the trilogy. It's a piece that should not be missed. Alsoyou have archival documentaries from previous releases, audiocomentaries, galleries, trailers, The Back to the Future Night with Leslie Nielsen  and The Back to the Future Ride (both are great), deleted scenes, The Phiysics of Back to the Future and much more.<br /><br />You also have Digital Copies of the three films.<br /><br />My set also came with a Hot Wheels DeLorean replica.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br />The BTTF trilogy is one of the best that have been released and regardless which one is your favorite (mine's the first), the three of them offer high quality entertainment. With great restorations and a good amount of bonus material including a spectacular new documentary, Universal have made this set a must-own for everyone. Highly recommended!!!</p></body></html>

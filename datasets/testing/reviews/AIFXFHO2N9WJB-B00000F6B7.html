Even though I hated the first movie, I am thankful that it did well at the box office, because thanks to its success movie audiences were treated to the cinematic goodness that is "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan".  Fans of the original series were ecstatic to learn that the genetically engineered superhuman known as Khan, that last appeared in the original TV series during the episode "Space Seed", would be returning to cause trouble for Captain Kirk and company after his exile at the hands of Kirk.  Though the level of hype surrounding this sequel was incredibly high, one still had to wonder about a few things regarding the movie.  One, can "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan" truly capture the spirit of adventure that was found throughout the TV series, yet was lacking in the first movie.  Second, would the story of Khan's return be engaging enough to carry a feature film, and how could Khan return due to his exile on a deserted planet with the rest of his genetic superhumans.  And third, can Ricardo Montalban still carry the malice required to ensure that Khan is still one to be feared (this worry was due to Montalban's recurring role on the TV series "Fantasy Island).  So, did the movie achieve box office glory and lay all fears to rest, or did it fall victim to its own hype?  Read on through the movie synopsis to find out for sure.<br /><br />15 years after being exiled on a deserted planet by Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and the rest of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise, genetic superhuman Khan (Ricardo Montalban) is seeking a means to escape the planet so that he may exact his revenge on the despised Captain.  After a mishap lands members of the Federation on the planet Khan and his superhumans are inhabiting, Khan commandeers the starship and by controlling the minds of the crew makes contact with a Federation science vessel that is housing a machine known as the Genesis device, whose sole purpose is to rejuvenate dead planets making them viable for living beings again.  Khan knows that with this device at his command he can take over the universe, though the device creates life, if used upon a planet that already is thriving with life, it would effectively kill anything alive in order to start things over anew.  When word of Khan's attack on the science vessel reaches Starfleet, the powers that be, bring newly promoted Admiral Kirk back to action to face his old nemesis, but Kirk can't stop him alone, he'll need his entire crew back for this mission, along with his old ship that just so happens to be under the command of Kirk's former science officer the Vulcan known as Spock (Leonard Nimoy).  With the crew of the Enterprise reassembled and time quickly running out, Kirk and company head off to do battle with the most cunning and powerful enemy they have ever faced, and this time there will be dire consequences for the Enterprise and her crew.<br /><br />So, in response to the question I posed prior to the movie synopsis, did the movie achieve box office glory and lay all the doubts and fears to rest?  The answer would have to be a resounding "YES!"  With the release of "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan" it was clear that the creative minds behind this franchise were clearly firing on all cylinders, and that the fiasco of "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" could be overcome.  This movie featured everything the first film should have had, from gripping drama involving all of the characters, special effects work that was astounding back in the day, but still holds up fairly well even now, an excellent villain with Khan, and plenty of humor, suspense, and action to please even the most jaded of fans.  Written perfectly by Harve Bennett, this movie pleased fans of the genre on so many levels, and the ending was so crafty and shocking that it left you begging for more, as any good movie should.<br /><br />As I said before, I absolutely hated "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", and I know that many hard-core 'Trekkies' would love to string me up for that statement, but I offer this peace offering, as much as I hated the first film, I loved "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan" to the same degree.  If you were, or still are, a fan of 'Star Trek' whether it be the various TV series' or whatever, but was turned off to the series because of the first film, please do yourself the favor and watch the sequels, you won't be disappointed..<br /><br />"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan" is rated PG for violence and language.</p></body></html>

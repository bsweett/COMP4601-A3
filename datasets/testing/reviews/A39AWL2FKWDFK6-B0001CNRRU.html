<meta name="summary" content="Awesome acting performances"></head><body><p>Director Alejandro Inarritu strikes gold with his amazing triumvirate of life experiences that merge to create the plot of &quot;21 Grams&quot;.  Housewife Naomi Watts loses her husband and two young daughters in a hit and run accident perpetrated by career criminal and born again ex-con Benicio Del Toro.  Watts' husband's demise provides the heart for transplant for Sean Penn who is dying of heart failure.  After the operation Penn grows tired of his lukewarm and childless marriage and begins to pursue Watts. She goes ballistic when learns that Penn is the transplant recipient.  They eventually bond and plot to evoke vengeance against the devastated and remorseful Del Toro.<p>The acting performances by the three major players were absolutely superb.  Penn and Del Toro with Oscars already on their resumes are already well established.  Watts however was the star of the show.  Her portrayal was unexpectedly magnificent and possibly more impressive than Charlize Theron's Oscar winning performance in Monster.</p></body></html>

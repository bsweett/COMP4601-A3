<meta name="summary" content="The single best movie of the '70s!"></head><body><p>There were too many to choose from.  THE EXORCIST, JAWS, ROCKY, STAR WARS; the 1970s was a decade that brave, new and young directors like Spielberg, Scorcese and Lucas were breaking away from the old Hollywood system and introducing fresh, independent stories and film making to the screen.<br /><br />But it was Francis Ford Coppola who took "an offer he couldn't refuse" and directed Mario Puzo's book, which was, at best, nothing more than a beach read.  The result was a legendary film that redefined the gangster picture as well as the traditional meaning of "family".  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and James Caan gave electrifying performances and it won the Oscar for best picture of the year for 1972.</p></body></html>

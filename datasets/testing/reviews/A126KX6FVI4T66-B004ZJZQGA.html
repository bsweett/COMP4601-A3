<meta name="summary" content="What hit-men do on vacation?"></head><body><p>See the sights, pick up girls, get in fights and kill each the other?<br />Sort of a sad slow waltz of a movie that feels more like Austria<br />than Belgium? Writer seems to have a thing against Americans,<br />with a scene with three fat Americans and later an American midget.<br />A gun from a friend of Harry's... with a silencer, but Ray wants to kill himself because of killing a little boy while hitting a priest.<br />Some crazy fellers here in Bruges can't get even killing straight.<br />Harry says:"Don't be such a poof". Gets pretty grim toward the end with<br />blood and chase and all.</p></body></html>

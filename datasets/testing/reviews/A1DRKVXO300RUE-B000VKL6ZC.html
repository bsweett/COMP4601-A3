<meta name="summary" content="Absurd garbage and a Zombie letdown"></head><body><p>Let me preface by saying that I really enjoy House of 1000 Corpses and of course consider Halloween to be one of the all time greatest movies.  So this seemed like the perfect movie - one of the most immortal concepts ever paired with a modern day highly creative director.  Wrong.  Like M. Night Shamalamadingdong, Zombie's movies have been progressively terrible as he went forward.  House of 1000 Corpses was fantastic - great sets and visuals.  However, every other release has been a disaster, and this movie is no exception, and is an insult to the Halloween tradition.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE PEEPERS"></head><body><p>Any movie that has once Oscar nominated Eileen Brennan (Private Benjamin) offering a five minute cameo as a crazy old lady with zillions of cats can't be all bad.  And it's not.  While it is short on plot, long on stupidity, and poorly lensed, JEEPERS CREEPERS is a scary little movie.  Patricia Belcher as the psychic also is so bad she is good, does that make sense?  The kids (Gina Phillips &amp; Justin Long) try hard to be brother/sister, but they do some incredibly stupid things and their looks of shock early on are definitely high school thespian at best.  However, towards the end, especially in the scenes at the police station, Phillips and Long show signs of being really capable performers.  The ending in which Gina offers herself in place of Long is a very unusual anti-formula one, and its resolution quite shocking.<br />I have to say, too, the early sequence in which the truck is harrassing the younguns is pretty effective, too.<br />Not a cinematic gem, but it is a scary one.</p></body></html>

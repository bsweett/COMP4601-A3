<meta name="summary" content="Less Than Mediocre Gangster Film"></head><body><p>It is always an uphill battle to criticize a great filmmaker like David Cronenberg (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1126G">A History of Violence</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009298N4">Dead Ringers</a>).  Especially when he has two of the brightest actors around in Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts to work with.  But somehow Eastern Promises managed to be a disappointment for me and I'm quite sure my negative opinion of it will not be popular, so I will defend it as effectively as I can.  First though, let me provide a brief overview.<br /><br />Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts) works at a hospital in London.  She oversees the death of a pregnant 14 year old Russian girl.  The child survives and Anna is left with the girl's diary.  It leads her to a restaurant owned by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a Russian crime boss.  Anna wants to track down this girl's family so she can find a safe place for the baby that survived.  Anna's uncle helps to translate the diary and they discover some key secrets regarding Semyon and his son Kirill's (Vincent Cassel) crimes against the baby's dead mother.  Kirill's sidekick is Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen).  Nikolai is enigmatic and cold but his potential has him rising quickly in rank for protecting the often irresponsible Kirill.  Obviously there are some key plot points that are better left unrevealed.<br /><br />The twists in Eastern Promises have been praised but really, place the film in New Jersey and make the gangsters Italian-Americans and sorpresa!, a predictable and formulaic mafia film.  Although, the twists are certainly worth keeping secret and many viewers will probably find them to be enjoyable, they didn't work for me.  I didn't predict them outright but it wasn't difficult to see the intentions that undermined each character and a twist seemed inevitable throughout.  I actually felt a twist or two looming over the film the whole time.  I also thought the major twist in the film's climax to be unconvincing altogether after it happened.  And it wasn't just the twists that seemed like an ethnic proud mafia film all over again.  The different cultural things Russian gangsters hold dear was no doubt an education to some but I was only a little interested and there is a scene at the restaurant were Semyon is enjoying some live music that was just too reminiscent of the tired clich&eacute;s repeatedly borrowed over the years from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather</a> and other such films.<br /><br />As far as the performances go, Viggo is great and so is his accent.  Naomi Watts has never been bad in anything she has done, even when she was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059H98">Jet Girl</a>.  I thought the remaining supporting cast was absolutely disposable despite what many others have said, and unfortunately I include Vincent Cassel here, who I really like.  On a positive note, Cronenberg's pacing is strong and he once again enlists his favorite cinematographer, the incredibly talented Peter Suschitzky, to help the film look great.<br /><br />Now, about the controversial naked Viggo fight scene.  Cronenberg definitely wanted this scene to stand out and it does, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.  Of course there is a double standard and that is almost forgivable, but if it were Naomi Watts in the naked fight scene the film would unquestionably have gained an NC-17 rating and earned a hardcore exploitation label right down there with the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001LJCRU">Ilsa the She-Wolf Warden of the SS</a>.  I'm probably guilty of adhering to the double standard too as the film might have received a higher rating for that.  Not to knock the authenticity of the fight scene though, it was certainly compelling and original.  I won't forget it for some time, that's for sure.  All in all, I'm taking the high road from the status quo here.  Eastern Promises did not work for me but it certainly may for some.</p></body></html>

Crowe's portrayal of Captain Jack Aubrey is Oscar-worthy and a shame that he was overlooked. ALthough somewhat swept aside by "Lord of the Rings" last year, this film is still one of the year's best. An accurate depiction of naval life and excellent performance by the newcomers, especially the young midshipmen. Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

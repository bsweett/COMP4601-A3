This movie is also quite good.<br /><br />The story of Evolutions picks up right where the first film left off. There is great action early on, which eventually slows a bit for the purposes of the laying out of the storyline, but there is very solid action throughout.<br /><br />We get to see Marcus and William awoken from their hybernations. These are the two sons of Alexander Corvinus. Marcus was the first vampire and William was the first Lycan... This gets interesting...<br /><br />The hybrid use of stuntwork and CGI comes together nicely for some bad@ss effects.<br /><br />Good action. Good storyline. Good effects. I recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OUTRAGEOUS AND SOPHISTICATED - A Comedy Masterpiece"></head><body><p>"Hot" is the perfect word to describe Billy Wilder's comedy masterpiece - along with "outrageous" and "sophisticated." Two out-of-work musicians - played by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon - are driven by desperate circumstances to impersonate female musicians in an all-girl band that's headed to Florida. It is winter in 1930's Chicago, and they've just witnessed the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. George Raft plays one of the gangsters responsible for the shooting, and he's hot on their trail; as is Pat O'Brien, a police detective determined to catch Raft.<br /><br />On the train ride to Florida, it isn't easy maintaining their cover while playing footsie with the band's gorgeously seductive singer, Sugar, played by Marilyn Monroe. She delivers a couple of really sultry numbers. When our cowardly heroes reach lush, tropical Florida, and an exclusive resort for retired millionaires, they think their problems are over. But they're just heating up. One of the millionaires, played by Joe E. Brown, takes a liking to Lemmon's female persona; and Curtis decides to pursue Sugar by doffing his wig and female padding and donning a blue blazer and captain's cap, a la Cary Grant. But things get even more complicated, and hot.<br /><br />In order to pursue Monroe, Curtis blackmails Lemmon into keeping Brown occupied on shore while he and Monroe take advantage of the millionaire's yacht. In one of the great, classic scenes of cinema, we cut between Curtis and Monroe making love on the yacht, while Lemmon and Brown dance away the night at an outdoor restaurant. Curtis convinces Monroe that he has become frigid because of a lost love, so she decides to try to cure him. Cut to Lemmon and Brown dancing a tango to the same tune Billy Wilder used in Sunset Boulevard for the New Year's Eve party. Cut back to Curtis and Monroe kissing - he's starting to thaw. Cut to Lemmon and Brown dancing - they exchange a long stem carnation between their teeth. Back to Curtis and Monroe - his glasses are becoming fogged. Lemmon and Brown - they've blindfolded the orchestra!<br /><br />When the two red-hot lovers meet back at their room, Lemmon tells Curtis that he's engaged. "Who's the lucky girl," Curtis asks. "I am," Lemmon coos, as he plays the shakers he's brought back from the restaurant. Curtis is stunned: he's done such a good job convincing his friend that he's a girl, Lemmon's ready to pick out china. Now he has to try to undo it, but it's not going to be easy:  the deluded Lemmon is thinking about the alimony checks he'll collect if the marriage doesn't work out. It's all a lot of really outrageous - and sophisticated - fun.<br /><br />Some Like It Hot was a high point in the careers of its three stars, as well as its director. Curtis and Lemmon would pair up again in The Great Race (1965), a wonderful Blake Edwards slapstick spoof, and make many more films as well - but this was one of their best. Monroe, on the other hand, appeared in only three more films before her death at the age of 36 in 1962 - so this was definitely the high point of her career. Billy Wilder would make about a dozen more films; but since this was his best comedy, it was a high point for him, too. Some Like It Hot was nominated for six Oscars, but only won Best Costume Design for a Black-and-White film, because it was competing against Ben-Hur, which swept the Oscars that year.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

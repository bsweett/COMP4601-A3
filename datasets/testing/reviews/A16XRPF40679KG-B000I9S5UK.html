This movie is so bad that it takes the premise of a group of cops and convicts under attack from a killer gang (and most real gangs are organized drug dealing killers) in a closing precinct building into a idiotic story about bad cops attacking the station instead.  It's badly written and in spite of some good actors it's just a nasty movie without much merit.  How many times in history have gangs surrounded and attacked someplace and murdered kids even to get what they want? many times... how many times has this happened with a group of bad cops? and even worse cops who act like untrained idiots!  oh well.  they lost the premise and real menace that a true evil gang can deliver because they (in some cities) are already shooting up and killing innocent people routinely , including kids who get in their way.  Sure there<br /> are some bad cops; but this movie has no charm and seems mindlessly hateful about cops in general. (I am not a cop by the way)  Skip this one and watch the original which is a crime movie classic!.</p></body></html>

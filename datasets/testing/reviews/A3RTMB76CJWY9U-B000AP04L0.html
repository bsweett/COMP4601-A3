<meta name="summary" content="Awesome Satire, So-So Romance"></head><body><p>How sad for all of us that the Bill Lumberghs of the world--the men (and women) who most desperately need Office Space--won't be able to "get it."<br /><br />Those of us who do "get it," however, will love this send up of office life. Much like the wonderful series The Office (U.K. version), Office Space tears into the insanity of our working lives with deadly, painful accuracy. It is obvious that Mike Judge has talent with satire, and this film makes me hope that he plans on producing more in this area in the future.<br /><br />Eventually, the movie pushes the satire to the back-burner and concentrates on telling a romance story with Jennifer Aniston. When it does, the movie loses a little steam as their relationship is simply not as interesting as watching characters like Lumbergh, the receptionist or the waiter with the perma-smile on his face.<br /><br />But that aside, this movie is a classic satire that will be quoted by your friends for years to come, and is definitely something that needs to be watched to be clued-in to the culture of modern, working America. A must see.</p></body></html>

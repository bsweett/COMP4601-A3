<meta name="summary" content="Raising Kane"></head><body><p>Citizen Kane generally is considered the greatest film ever made.  It has top numerous lists (including AFI's Top 100 American Films) and is revered by practically every movie critic.  While some film has to rank number one, and Citizen Kane deserves the title as much as any film, actually watching the film is a bit of a letdown.  That is not to deny the film's greatness.  Orson Welles directed, co-wrote and stars in the film and he set the standard for the likes of Woody Allen and Spike Lee to command the three major components of a movie.  No one else reached the levels of greatness that Mr. Welles reached with Kane.  His acting is brilliant, the screenplay is sharp and his directing is first rate.  The fact that he only won an Oscar for the screenplay and the film was a commercial bomb shows that the Academy and film going public weren't ready to accept this progressive film and how he was ahead of his time.  The actors in the film were apart of Mr. Welles' Mercury Players and they all (especially Joseph Cotton) give strong turns.  Going back to my point about the film being a bit of a letdown, I mean with all the praise and superlatives that are heaped on the Citizen Kane, the film has set such an impossible buildup, it may not meet the modern film fan's expectations.  The bonus disk is worthy of a separate release itself.  It contains the documentary, The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which itself was nominated for an Oscar, that is one of the better documentaries about Hollywood that has been produced.  Orson Welles was a true movie visionary, but despite the fact that he would go on to create many first rate films, he was never able to duplicate the greatness of Citizen Kane.</p></body></html>

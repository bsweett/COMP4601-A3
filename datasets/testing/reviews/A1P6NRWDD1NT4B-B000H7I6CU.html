<meta name="summary" content="CARS Races Towards Classic Status"></head><body><p>Great movie as expected from Pixar/Disney. To this reviewer, however, the plot of CARS is lifted, and closely resembles the 1991 Michael J. Fox movie, DOC HOLLYWOOD. With that aside, the animation/CGI is breathtaking and the characters are spot-on excellent. Paul Newman has resisted doing films with special effects, but this one was tailor made for him since its about cars and car racing. The film may be a little long, and some of the humor may not hold the attention of younger children, but it is excellent for the adults and young adults. Pixar has added to their  list, a film destined to be a classic.</p></body></html>

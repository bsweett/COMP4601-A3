A man with a perfect family (of course it's perfect, because how could we have sympathy for anyone who's not perfect?) has a mid-life crisis, emerging victorious at the end.  Kind of like Death of a Salesman without the death part.  Along the way, trite set pieces of drama arise (someone's in the hospital!  how can I pay for college!) to be overcome as well.  The script is banal, trite and Lifetime Channel movie-like.<br /><br />Scarlett Johannsen is strangely lifeless, as in virtually all her roles, and sucks the energy out of the film every time she appears.  Her popularity, and her seeming presence in every single movie in 2005, are perplexing at best.  I've seen props that have outacted her.  Not even Bruce-the-Shark type exciting props like in Jaws, but just stuff lying around the set.  The supporting players are ill-used, particularly Quaid's wife, who gets to say about 5 sitcom lines in the course of the movie.<br /><br />On top of that, the direction is strange and clunky, with bizarre camera placements and directorial decisions that veer between television-basic and outright strange.<br /><br />"In Good Company" is also a stellar example of screenwriters' complete lack of familiarity with the business and corporate world outside of Hollywood and the studios.  While corporate politics abound in the real world, and layoffs happen all the time, the behaviors of some of the people at the companies in this movie are clunky and cartoonish, and bear no resemblance to the real world.<br /><br />So what's good about this movie?  Why three stars?  Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace.  They turn in performances that convert what could have been a trite, painful-to-watch mess into a serviceable film.  Indeed, "In Good Company" is a textbook example of how good actors can overcome a trite screenplay and clunky direction.  Topher Grace has always been likeable, even though I've always suspected that in That 70s Show he essentially plays himself.  However, in this film, he shows that he can turn in not just a performance, but a great one.  The same goes for Dennis Quaid.<br /><br />This movie is not worth going out of your way for at the video store.  Nevertheless, if it's Friday night at 10 pm and one of the only choices that remains for you is "In Good Company", it's worth picking up.  You aren't going to love it, but you won't be chucking shoes at the TV when it's over shouting about how it stole two hours of your life, either.</p></body></html>

So when I found out that the big-screen adaptation of Peter Chung's wonderful animated series AEon Flux would star Theron and be directed by Kusama, I was hopeful that the film would have some teeth to it. Alas, as everyone in the world but me seemingly knew, I was wrong.<br /><br />Theron plays the title character, who lives in a world whose five million inhabitants all live in a single city, the world outside having "gone back to nature." The city has been ruled by a benevolent dictator for most of those four hundred years, but things have started getting a little weird, and a rebel faction, the Monicans, has sprung up. AEon Flux is a member of the Monican resistance, and she gets an assignment from her handler (Fargo's Frances MacDormand) to assassinate said dictator, Trevor Goodchild (xXx's Martin Csokas). Except that, well, something makes her hesitate, and that something is the vast coincidence upon which the entire film turns. And once you accept that fact that you've been handed a vast coincidence, the whole thing simply falls apart, becoming nothing more than an excuse for a mindless shoot-em-up with all sorts of nifty special effects. (Sophie Okonedo's character, who has had her feet replaced with a second set of hands, is the recipient of, by far, the coolest of the film's effects.)<br /><br />So, the short answer: the only reason to watch this film has to do with Charlize Theron and a few yards of skintight leather. Which, I admit, could have even made Reds worth watching, really. But be prepared for the fact that Girlfight this ain't. **</p></body></html>

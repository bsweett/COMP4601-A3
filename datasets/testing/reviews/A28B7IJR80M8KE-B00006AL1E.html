<meta name="summary" content="Finally!!! on DVD!!!"></head><body><p>When viewed back-to-back, these 3 films could be one movie, however you look at it, the original film released in 1985 is a classic, it begins in a rather quiet fashion, where we see the homestead of Doc Brown who it seems has an endless aray of clocks, all set at the same time,we are given a glimpse of this man & his personality, soon Marty(Michael J. Fox) enters & hooks up to one of Doc's oversized amplifiers that explodes if set on high, propelling Marty across the room in a rather comical scene, where Marty quotes> "Rock-n-Roll" we realize that Marty is a typical 80's teenager that hangs out with Doc, probably because he is fun to be around,as Doc introduces his new invention, a time-traveling DeLorean, he is soon ambushed by terrorist that he stole plutonium from, the DeLoren's power source,he is killed & Marty flees in an attempt to escape, which he does into the year 1955, where he has to get in touch with Doc's younger counterpart to find a power source capable of sending him back, in the process he interrupts his parents first meeting, altering his existence, this is intense as Marty now has to get his parents together while the 1955 Doc has to find a power source since plutonium is non-existent in 1955, they realize a bolt of lightning can substitute the source, since history says it will strike the town clock tower at 10:04 on Nov 12,1955, the 1950's culture is neat to say the least, not only does Marty have to reunite his parents, but he has to make a decision whether or not to inform Doc of his inpending fate in 1985, getting his parents together is intense to say the least, but once he does, the real intensity is getting back as him & Doc argue about his inpending fate, as you can guess, everything that can go wrong does,but Doc gets Marty back to 1985 successfully, won't spoil it for those who have not seen it, which is probably minimal at best, but they are successful after all, the second film is fun but un-even, the futuristic 2015 is less convincing in its approach, one can only guess what it will really be like, I just wish they would have done a "Blade Runner"-like setting instead, this is the only aspect that falls short on the second film, the hellish 1985 that Marty & Doc encounter as they return to their time is consequentual in how time-travel can be misused, they discover that Biff(the first film's bully) has somehow stolen the DeLorean in 2015 as an old man with a sports almanac with sports dates from 1950 to 2000 to travel back to 1955 & give it to his younger self in the hopes of acquiring millions in wealth, which his younger self does creating an alternate 1985 for Marty & Doc, who now have to travel back to 1955 during Marty's first trip to retrieve the almanac thus settngs thing back the way they were, they are once again successful, but soon the same lightning storm that sent Marty back in the first film has now struck Doc in mid-air whose DeLorean now has a hover-conversion, thus sending Doc back to 1885, where Marty now has to go to get Doc, which in turn sets up the third film, which re-captures the warm feeling of the first film, we see Hill Valley as it looked during th old west, & Marty & Doc's attempt to once again get back to 1985, but Doc soon falls for Clara(Mary Steenburgen) who is a local, the lightning bolt destroyed the hover-conversion, & now Doc & Marty's only hope for getting back is pushing the DeLorean up to 88 MPH, which they do on a railroad track, since there are no roads or gas, by hijacking a train, like the first film, Murphy's Law happens once again, but they once again pull it off, with Doc staying behind with Clara, the western landscapes are by far good to look at, the filmakers definately give it a western feel, the same as in the first film's 1950's look, & is a great trilogy in all fairness, despite the second film's flaws, the third more than makes up for it!!</p></body></html>

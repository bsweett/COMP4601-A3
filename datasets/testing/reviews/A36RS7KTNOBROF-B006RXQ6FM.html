<meta name="summary" content="A great film you only need to see once"></head><body><p>"Doubt" is one of thoes films you only need to see once.I have to give it 5 stars for the great acting,but its alittle borning,but you keep watching to find the truth,but you never do.<br />I did laugh alot at Meryl Steep.She is always great,but she hit this charater perfect.We had mean nuns just like this one in school.<br />A week before I saw "Doubt" our priest gave the same sermon Philip Seymour Hoffman gave about the pillow feathers.I thought this movie wouldn't be a film the Catholic Church would approve,but after watching It,I can understand why they want everyone to see the film.</p></body></html>

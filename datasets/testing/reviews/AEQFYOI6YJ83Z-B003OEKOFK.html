If that doesn't immediately put you off, then you should probably watch it.<br /><br />For those of you looking for some summary: three middle-aged guys (Adam, Nick, and Lou) are having a bad time of it.  Together (along with Adam's nephew Jacob) then decide to go to a ski resort where they partied like rock stars in the 80's.  Except they find the place utterly dead.  The only remotely interesting thing there is the hot tub.  They all get in (four dudes naked in a hot tub, perfectly normal), get drunk, pass out, and come to in the 1980s.  There's a creepy old hot tub repairman (ladies and gentlemen, Chevy Chase!) who may or may not have something to do with time travel.  There are hot chicks and cool dudes.  And Adam, Nick, and Lou?  They're kids again, ready to re-live the best days of their lives.  Except something strange is happening to Jacob...and really, it's very, very hard to do the same thing twice, when you know you'll get your butt kicked, get a fork in the eye, and generally suffer the ravages of adolescence all over again.  It's so tempting to change things...<br /><br />Does that make any sense?  Probably not.  But it's not really supposed to; HOT TUB TIME MACHINE is about four guys bonding and having a good time, finding themselves and each other...along with sex jokes, other dirty jokes, and generally the sort of humor we've come to associate with Rob Corddry and Craig Robinson (both of whom shine here, by the way).  Clark Duke is pretty good as Jacob, too, but John Cusak is the real star here (no offense to the rest of the cast).  He brings the same amount of integrity he brings even to his worst movies; this isn't among that category, thank God, but it's nowhere near as good as his best comedies.  HOT TUB is something of an amalgam of eighties sex comedies and 21st century sex comedies; there's the heart of the former, with the utter disregard of the latter.  It creates an interesting blend that doesn't quite surpass the sum of its parts, as it should.  Still, if you're looking for a good time, you could do worse.  But again, it all hinges on the title: does a movie named HOT TUB TIME MACHINE sound like your kind of thing?  Normally you can't judge a movie by its title; here, you can.  So judge away.  And if you're at all interested, then give it a shot.</p></body></html>

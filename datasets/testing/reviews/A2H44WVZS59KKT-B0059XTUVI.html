<meta name="summary" content="Could have been so much more"></head><body><p>Margaret Thatcher was such a huge figure in British politics and for, whatever reason, the filmmakers decided to focus on her latter years and her battle with dementia. AND they didn't even do that well.<br /><br />That is not to say that Meryl Streep doesn't do a fabulous job because she does - as always. Watching her in this film WAS like watching Thatcher herself.  But I was hoping for so much more - an in-depth look at Thatcher's service to her country and the changes she helped bring about. That didn't happen and I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's worth watching "Iron Lady" just to see Streep's performance but I wouldn't watch it for a history lesson.</p></body></html>

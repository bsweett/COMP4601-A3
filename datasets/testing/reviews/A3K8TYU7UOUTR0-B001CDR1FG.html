<meta name="summary" content="A worthwhile version for Hulk fans"></head><body><p>This is a much better movie than I feared it might be. I'll keep this brief. When Bruce Banner gets mad, the movie easily fulfils all hopes. So often computer graphics disappoint in that there is no sense of "reality." The action has no weight, and there is no sense of real power. That is not the case here. The special effects folks did an amazing job in conveying the Hulk's sheer size and terrifying strength. When the green giant tangles with the tanks, It really seems like steel is being torn.  And, suffice to say, the &quot;dog fight&quot; scene is literally worth the purchase price (as was Nick Nolte's final raving scene). <p>The Hulk was (and still is) my favorite comic, and I do not feel cheated by this version. But, it must be said, I think Mr. Lee missed something essential in the Hulk myth. What drove the Hulk/Banner character throughout the comic book was an extreme sense of isolation, of being an outsider from the rest of humanity. Bruce Banner was always a man on the outside because of this terrible beast within him, a terrible dark side that could tear loose at any second.  He could never have normal attachments, and he could never lead a normal life. He was just a drifter. Lost. Director Lee went instead with a very modern &quot;dysfunctional family&quot; theme as the source of the Hulk's rage. While it was an interesting take on it, I prefer the more traditional take on the Hulk; i.e. Bruce Banner drifting from town to town with his terrible secret haunting him at every step. This was the aspect that the television series, and original TV movie with Bill Bixby, captured so well. Perhaps we will see more of this in the sequel, as, admittedly, this was kind of an "origin" movie. <p>Still, there is more to admire in this version than curse. I will buy the DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Losers don't always lose..."></head><body><p>Despite being hesitant about watching this (the director was behind the overrated About Schmidt) i came out of the theater reasonably happy that i did.<br /><br />While "Sideways" is actually a film that blends many familiar themes in its plot it manages to introduce them achieving an atmosphere that makes it a very warm and ultimately very human film. These themes include a traditional loser type who cant get over his collapsed marriage (Giammati) and who has become self-loathing and bitter about it as well as about his soon NOT to be published book, and his friend who fully exploits him for a few sexual adventures before he himself gets married as they both embark in a weekly trip culminating to the wedding.<br /><br />  Now, if you feel that the storyline might be one of those pseudo-intellectual comedies rest assured that it isn't.<br /><br />  Sideways is genuingly funny in a manner that we all know real life can be. It's also equally tragic mostly because the loser of the story is a terrifically convincing character, one of those people that actually proclaim themselves losers even though they possess wonderful qualities that they themselves do not realise. This character is given a great performance by Giammati, one that should easily be considered for Oscar material even if the film doesnt have the otherwise flashy credentials recquired for such a consideration.<br /><br />The world of "Sideways" evolves around this loser and his efforts to somehow fit in despite his defeats. His closest friend isnt too interested in saving him and couldnt even if he intended to. Not only that but he leads him from one hilarious disaster onto another. Hilarious yes, farsical even, but still very believable. The scriptwriter obviously managed to achieve a very fine balance here, without which we'd have another fine idea messed up on celluloid.<br /><br />I's definetely not a situational comedy as most of the charm of the film is based on some seriously self-sarcastic and poignant dialogue and this counts as an extra asset to it.<br /><br />One of the bigger surprises in films this year, "Sideways" shouldnt be ignored by anyone who looks for a comedy which isnt really a comedy or for a drama which isnt that either, but something in between which will have you laughing and thinking at the same time..</p></body></html>

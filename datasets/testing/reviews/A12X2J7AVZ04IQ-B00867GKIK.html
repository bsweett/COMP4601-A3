<meta name="summary" content="Very entertaining parable/fable"></head><body><p>The irrascible Ed Asner is here to provide a narrative as outrageous as it is substantive. Kids, dogs and mean people abide, and all works out via seemingly insurmountable odds. I haven't read any other reviews, but so much is given that all can learn from. Great lessons for kids: old people are not all bad; some kids who don't fit in might have talents that will surprise you; all Labradors will love you, regardless. All of the above depends on how you're treated by those who care for you. A lovely film, lots of action, and lots of love. I enjoyed it very much.  Some DVD extras are good. "Dug's Special Mission" is just an outtake from the film, but an added animated short called "Partly Cloudy" was sweet, sentimental and enjoyable. An extension of the lesson of "Up"... with understanding, all things can be worked out.</p></body></html>

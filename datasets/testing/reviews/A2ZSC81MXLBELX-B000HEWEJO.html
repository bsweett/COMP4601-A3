<meta name="summary" content="Zuzu's Petals......"></head><body><p>This review refers to the Republic Pictures (Dist by Artisan)DVD edition of "It's a Wonderful Life".......<br /><br />You do NOT have to wait until Christmas to open this gift. Now that Frank Capra's wonderful film from 1946 is on this pristeen DVD it may be enjoyed anytime of the year. "It's A Wonderful Life" is the feel good movie of the all time.It should be watched anytime you need a lift!(Okay, Okay , you can watch it at Christmas time too!).<br /><br />ASC(Angel Second Class), Clarence Oddbody needs to get his wings.George Bailey is desperatley in need of an Angel. So the powers up above arrange a meeting.  It's a story made in heaven.<br /><br />Clarence gets to view George Bailey's life from the time he was a young boy until the present, when George is having so many problems he thinks he would be better off if he'd never been born (it may be safe to say we have all had days like that!). We watch as George touches the lives of so many from boyhood to adulthood. He saves his brother's life,he stops his boss(a druggist) from making a fatal mistake, he saves the family business, "The Building and Loan Assoc" from the hands of the Scroogelike Mr. Potter, is friend and mentor to so many, and although never gets to follow his dreams of travel, settles down with the girl next door in his town, "Bedford Falls".<br /><br />But things start going amiss for poor George,an accidental misplacemnet of a large sum of money, and the auditor showing up just at the wrong time, causes George to face loosing everything he THINKS is important. He's on the bridge, ready to pack it all in when his guardian angel Clarence shows up in the nick of time.Clarence shows George what life would REALLY be like if he was never born. It's not good! George must realize that "It's A Wonderful Life" before he can exsist again.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey. He is just tremendous in this role. We see the full range of his talents as he runs the course of going from carefree, to distraught, to bitter and finally elated with life as he discovers Zuzu's petals have reappeared in his pocket.The petals that dissapeared from his pocket when he dissapeared from exsistence. Henry Travers is Clarence and there has never been a more cherubic angel than he. Donna Reed as Mary(George's wife) is exceptional at making a wonderful life for George and looking great doing it. And Lionel Barrymore is the mean Mr. Potter who we love to hate. There are so many other famous faces to look for that do such a supberb job, here are a few...the great character actor Thomas Mitchell is the forgetful "Uncle Billy", Lillian Randolph is "Annie", the housekeeper, Beulah Bondi as Mrs. Bailey, Ellen Corby, the lady who only wants $17.50, Gloria Grahame is Violet and don't miss Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer, mischievous as ever at the pool scene.<br /><br />Hollywood is no slouch when it comes to making the old look young, and that is no exception for this film. At 57 it looks amazingly new on this DVD. It is remastered from the original film negative and the sound in Dolby Digital is clear as a bell( oh.. I think an angel just got his wings..)The black and white images are clear, sharp and bright. I was very impressed. There are a couple of special features, found on side b(don't worry the whole film is on side a). A great "making of" featurette narrated by Tom Bosley has lots of great info. There's also "A Personal Remembrance" with Frank Capra Jr., that has some nice interviews with Jimmy and Frank, but contains much of the same info from the first featurette, but is nice to have. There is English Captioning for those who may need it, it may be viewed in French and Spanish with subtitles as well.<br /><br /> VHS edition - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CERX2">It's a Wonderful Life</a><br />and also sold in this great 2 pack:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0782010792">Christmas Collector's Pack (The Bells of St. Mary's / It's a Wonderful Life)</a><br /><br />So if you're feelinbg a little down, watch this movie and like Zuzu's petals, your smile will reappear......Laurie<br /><br />also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800114043">American Madness [VHS</a>](early Frank Capra - see my review for film details)<br />also on region 4 DVD:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PLU7TI">American Madness</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A decent flick, but nothing spectacular***1/2"></head><body><p>When compared to most action flicks of the last two years (such as the piece of crap SWAT movie) Hostage is above most of them. When compared to action/thrillers as a whole, Hostage is your average Bruce Willis action/thriller flick that is fun throughout, but nothing too memorable. I left the theater feeling satisfied, but I wasn't jumping for joy because I just saw the best action/thriller of my life exactly.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays hostage negotiator Jeff Talley who after witnessing a gruesome death of a child in a hostage situation gone bad, moves with his family out of Los Angeles to a smaller Californian town to work as chief of police. But he is soon dragged back into the hostage game when a car-jacking gets out of hand when 3 teenagers break into a mansion to try and steal an Escalade. The plot thickens later as we find out that the three teenagers have barracaded themselves in with something much more above themselves that a well funded group of organized criminals will do absolutely anything to get back. I don't want to say too much but that is basically the premise behind Hostage.<br /><br />Like I said before, Hostage is a decent flick with an interestingly enough premise behind it to make it watchable. There's also a few tense moments in it to make an okay thriller. Also, the characters were played finely and with depth. It was just that it wasn't a breath of fresh air or anything in this genre and it was a bit predictable.. I recommend that you wait for video, but if you're a fan of films like The Negotiator or Panic Room, you might want to check this one out sooner. It's a tough call.</p></body></html>

Theres a war brewing and also theres something fishy going on inside the matrix. Neo, being the chosen one must come face to face with multiple situations and deal with the outcome of each. Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving (The Adventures Of Priscilla Queen Of The Desert, Lord of the rings trilogy) is multipying inside the matrix..growing stronger and stronger and soon he will break out. Morpheus is convinced that better things will come and the machines will stop doing what they are doing and leave the humans along. There's action galore and more expanded story. The Wachaski Brothers have done it again making the questions and untold answers from the first one spew out into this one and sort of end it in the 3rd one. There's a long but highlighted chase scene on a highway...the digital burly brawl with Neo and The Agent Smith's, though come on people who are we kidding...there is no way in hell they could of choreographed that whole fight scene with just Keanu and a bunch of extras...theres no way. The ghost twins are excellent villains although they dont have that much time on film they make it entertaining while it lasts. Laurence Fishburne (Mystic River, Deep Cover) is just too cool for school...he's the bomb. We all know Reeves can act like wood sometimes in his movie but from my understanding Andy and Larry wrote the character of Neo that way...so it's really hard to know that Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and even Will Smith tried out for that role.. Keanu is a perfect cast. Also starring Harrold Perrineau, Jr. (Tv's LOST, HBO's OZ), Monica Bellucci (Brotherhood OF The Wolf, Under Suspicion), Lambert Wilson (Timeline), Harry Lennix (Collateral Damage, The Human Stain), Jada Pinkett Smith (Return To Pardise, Demon Knight)and Gloria Foster. Foster died before doing Revolutions, so they replaced her with actress Mary Alice</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Joltingly good -  I wish I'd seen it on the big screen (4.5)"></head><body><p>I missed "Ray" in theaters last fall.  It's entirely my failing, but my mood was just never conducive to a downbeat, two-and-a-half hour dissection of someone I prefer to remain in awe of.<br /><br />Having seen it now on DVD, I sorely wish I'd seen and heard it in theaters because it's a joltingly good film.  It understands the music and presents it in an absolutely riveting way; it respects the side characters (the Raylettes, Ertegum, Wexler, Fathead, Dowd, et al) and while the film may have a few more glowing sunbeams and moments of boldfaced exposition than I would've preferred, it really gets to the core of its central figure.<br /><br />What more can be said about Jamie Foxx as Ray?  I'll say that he creates a spooky combination of magic and electricity.  Some complain that he's merely doing an impersonation, and there's a grain of truth to that, but what a tricky and idiosyncratic impersonation it is. Somehow Foxx articulates a crucial by-product of Ray's necessary self-reliance: what must have been an almost purgatorial sense of loneliness. Had Foxx been just a hair or two off, the whole show would've been sunk but he pulls it off gloriously.<br /><br />His performance is matched by, and married to, the music, which is fantastic.  So many scenes stick out for me -- Ray, ecstatically smacking the lid of his piano during "Straighten Up and Fly Right" ; the harmonies of the Raylettes, combined with the faces of the actresses, during "Leave My Woman Alone" and "What Kind of Man Are You?" ; the furious, kinetic leap into "The Messaround" and especially the segue between one of the most devastating scenes in the film (Ray's childhood descent into blindness) and the lilting, electric notes that lead into "Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand."<br /><br />That's one of my favorite moments of the past year; it seems a gently musical way of saying, "Yes, terrible things happen, but sometimes they lead to beautiful things like this...."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Forget it Nick... it's Sandford.""></head><body><p>Officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is London's top police officer.  He's the best at everything he does and in just a few years on the force has achieved more than the rest of the department put together.  He's an excellent officer, but is so good that he's making everyone around him look bad.  He's given a promotion that virtually exiles him to the sleepy, dreamy village of Sandford.  He's assigned Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) as his partner, a junior officer and son of the local police chief, Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent).  Everything appears to be quiet in the small village until a couple of local actors are found decapitated.  Their deaths are ruled an accident, but Angel thinks there's something more going and soon discovers that the residents of the sleepy little village are hiding a dark secret.<br /><br />HOT FUZZ begins like a typical comical mystery movie.  There are some elements that are purposely overdone for comic effect, but the film still retains an aura of mystery and suspense.  That is until the last twenty-minutes of the movie. That's when the action-factor of the film kicks into high gear as well as humor meter.  When I saw HOT FUZZ for the first time, I was laughing so hard during the last part of the movie that there were a few times I had a hard time breathing.  In my opinion, the movie is the funniest film released in 2007.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who liked SHAUN OF THE DEAD, people who like action movies, and anyone with a decent sense of humor.</p></body></html>

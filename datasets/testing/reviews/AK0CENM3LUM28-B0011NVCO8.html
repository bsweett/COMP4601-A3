I cannot say with any authority how accurate this movie is, in comparison with the actual history, but the drama here is fantastic and worth taking in.<br /><br />American Gangster is the story of a poor Harlem black man who takes over the business and leadership of the area's most influential and recently deceased small-time crime lord, and builds a drug empire with his own two hands. Drugs are shipped in directly from Vietnam, via military planes, and are flooded onto the streets at high purities and low prices. And in the midst of all this, corrupt police simultaneously threaten and protect the drug dealers, working the system to milk it for all it is worth.<br /><br />There are several things I like about this movie, several points that undermine popular Hollywood conventions. Frank Lucas is not presented as an oppressed angel, nor as a lionized dark hero. He is a character with control and caution, but this control is not deemed as a virtue, and it is made clear than violence simmers under the surface, when he attacks employees and family members who have foolishly failed to adopt his careful control. And Richie Roberts, our intrepid detective, is presented  carefully, with plenty of flaws. Rather than use his numerous affairs to build up his character as a 'real' man, it is made clear that he is a somewhat shallow human being, who cares more about winning than about his son, and who does not cut off contacts with known criminals who are old friends.<br /><br />I appreciate that this movie is careful to show the casualties of the drug empire built by Frank Lucas. Unlike The Godfather (which I am fond of, make no mistake), where you rarely remember (or care) what the family is selling, you never forget that Lucas is selling hard drugs. And no matter where you stand on legalization, you recognize that flooding a market used to 5% purity with a product that is nearly 100% purity, and without warning, is going to result in some pretty gruesome overdoses. And it does.<br /><br />In the end, though, what I like most about this movie is that Roberts isn't just interested in the drug dealers - he wants the crooked cops, too. He recognizes that crooked cops are a danger to society and a smirch on his own standing as a cop, and he works within the system to improve the system. And that is something we need more of, both in real life and from Hollywood.<br /><br />This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing. I do not own this movie - I rented this through my Blockbuster Online account. I enjoy the movie immensely and am considering purchasing a copy for my home library.</p></body></html>

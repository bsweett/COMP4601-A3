Every other character seems false and about as 3-dimensional as cardboard.  Diaz and Chou both seem lost or characters from another movie.  Waltz's arch-enemy character is lame and how on earth did the editors decide that 2 hours of this would be a good idea?  You could edit it down to half that easily.  Just a big mess that had me checking my watch incessantly through the last half.</p></body></html>

It just didn't make me laugh.  Sure, there are some funny lines littered throughout the film, but as far as consistent humor it was sorely lacking.  The story from the beginning didn't really grab me, but with the right touch it could have eventually.  Larry the Cable Guy was by far the best thing to happen to this cartoon, but even he couldn't make me love it.  I will never be caught saying I wasn't impressed by it's beauty, I mean, I may not like the movie but I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't impressed in some ways, but I may also never be caught watching this movie again since aside from the animation there was nothing much to hold my attention.</p></body></html>

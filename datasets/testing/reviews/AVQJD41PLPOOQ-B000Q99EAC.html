But I suppose "all over again" are the key words here.<br /><br />When watching ROCKY BALBOA, you can't help but enjoy it as a guilty pleasure because it reminds you so much of the original ROCKY of 1976, with all of its heart, soul and drama.  But the fact is, is that when it's over, you've only been reminded and taken back to the spirit of the original film "all over again".  If that's all the sixth installment of this franchise has to offer, then you're better off watching the original best picture of 1976 all over again; it was the best film in the series and it always will be.</p></body></html>

Everything about this movie makes it a classic; reinforcing the character development of the first movie while developing the new characters shown here, the plot, the series of events, and the acting, which I forgot to mention in my review of the original "Halloween". Probably most memorable are the talents of both Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis, who is probably the best horror-movie hero I've seen and shows Donald's acting skills, and Jamie Lee Curtis as her role of Laurie, who returns as the scream queen.<br /><br />Comparatively, this movie is more graphic than the original "Halloween", which virtually didn't show a drop of blood, and DEFINITELY didn't show a dude in a creepy Halloween mask getting smashed between two trucks before a fiery explosion occurred. (Which is one of my favorite moments in the movie!) So yes, "Halloween 2" is a bit more graphic than the original "Halloween", and is just as scary and suspenseful.<br /><br />What I did notice about this movie is the chilling, dream-like atmosphere. I know most slashers have a somewhat earthy element, but there's something about the dark, deserted hallways of the hospital late at night on Halloween that sets an intense and dream-like atmosphere, which seriously fascinated me with the movie, especially considering I didn't pick up on that the last time I saw it. So this movie is able to be scary, graphic and atmospheric all at the same time.<br /><br />Overall, while stylistically it's somewhat different from the original "Halloween", "Halloween 2" is just as good a movie, if not better. For fans of slasher films or horror films in general, especially those who want a movie with a chilling, dream-like atmosphere, "Halloween 2" will be a scream! Pick it up in time for Halloween night, too, so you can enter the dark realm of terror known as the scariest night of the year. Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

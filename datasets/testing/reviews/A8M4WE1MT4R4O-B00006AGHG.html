I also appreciated the spirited performances of both Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson.  Ben Affleck managed to shed some tears, hoping for that Oscar nomination.  Ok now the bad news.... There were a couple of parts in the film that were so unrealistic.  Like the part when Ben Affleck is being sh**-canned by his father in law, afterwards he turns on the fire alarm and all the water begins to spray the office!?!  Please give me a break, no one would do that in real life. He would have left that office, got in his car and cried the whole way home. The most far fetched thing about this movie is these two men would have ended up killing each other for the things they did.  They would not have become friends at the end and try to help each other out. The ending of the movie is what ruined it for me, it was phony and hollywoodish....</p></body></html>

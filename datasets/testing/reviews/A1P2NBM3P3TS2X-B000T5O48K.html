<meta name="summary" content="If you know Tracy Letts' material you know what you're in for with this one."></head><body><p>Hold on to something, because BUG will get under your skin.<br /><br />I'm not really sure if I would classify this as a horror movie.  Maybe a dark love story.  A VERY VERY dark love story.  Playwright/screenwriter Tracy Letts seems to have an affinity for writing plays that feature the types of characters you'd find living in trailer parks and seedy motels. They are troubled folks, that's for sure, and often desperate.<br /><br />BUG is a tale of paranoia, yet coursing through its veins is a doomed love story. Agnes joins Peter in his paranoid delusions not because she shares his paranoia necessarily (at least not at first) but really because she desperately needs him as a lover and protector.  There are plenty of other reviews on this site to give you more specifics about plot and characters and theme, so I won't rehash it all here.<br /><br />The film is structured much like the play it is drawn from.  Having seen two of Tracy Letts' plays (many people in his plays end up naked, dead, or both) but not this one, I knew I was in for a wild ride.  The second half of this play/movie does not disappoint -- he ratchets up the intensity and adrenaline in each passing scene.  It actually got funnier as it got darker (typical Letts), thank goodness.  The ending was so explosive I can't possibly figure out how that could have been presented live on a stage.  I'm curious to know.<br /><br />I recommend this DVD to sophisticated fans of either horror or very dark comedy.  This is probably my second-favorite Tracy Letts work, resting just behind his play "Killer Joe" (not yet filmed).<br /><br />Trivia:  the actress who played the role of Agnes in the Off-Broadway production of "Bug" also played Lois the Prostitute in the first season of "NYPD Blue".  She was the one with special connection to the Andy Sipowicz character and played a part in his fate in the pilot episode.</p></body></html>

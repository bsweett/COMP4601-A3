<meta name="summary" content="Steve Martin as the Successor to Peter Sellers"></head><body><p>I admit it:  I laughed at the slapstick, sophomoric comedy of Steve Martin's entry into the Pink Panther series.  While Martin is no Peter Sellers, he has his own brand of physical, over-the-top comedy that is well-suited to the role of the incompetent, although ultimately successful, Inspector Clouseau. This movie moves rapidly from one joke to another, sometimes genuinely funny and other times not.  Although the resolution hinges on a hilarious twist that depends on the viewer underestimating Clousseau as much as the other characters do, most of the plot is uninteresting.  There is no suspense - except for when the next laugh will come - but Martin carries the film forward regardless.<br /><br />When a rich soccer coach is murdered in front of a stadium full of cheering fans and his famous Pink Panther diamond is missing from his hand,  an investigation begins.  Wily Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) wants the most incompetent man to lead the investigation - hence the entry of Clouseau.  Dreyfus wants to uncover the identity of the murderer on his own while the public is diverted by the bumbling Clouseau.  Clouseau, on the other hand, sees the case as the opportunity of a lifetime; he can prove his "superior" detective skills and serve his beloved France at the same time.  Jean Reno makes a superb, droll sidekick as Gendarme Ponton, a man who can only roll his eyes at Clouseau's antics but who develops an affection for the unwitting fall guy.  Together, Clouseau and Ponton tackle the case and its suspects, including the dead man's beautiful girlfriend, played by Beyonce Knowles.<br /><br />Steve Martin is the only actor who could pull off this role owned by Peter Sellers, and he succeeds by taking what Sellers did and modifying it with his individual comedy style.  Kevin Kline is delightfully slimy as Martin's frustrated supervisor. Don't expect anything new or ingenious in this film.  It's all low comedy, from flatulence jokes to the trademark Clouseau accent problems.  A few of the more clever touches, such as the appearance of a James Bond-like British secret agent and the surprising clue that solves the case,  are lost in the maze of one-liners and slapstick.  Still, this was an enjoyable ride, Steve Martin style.</p></body></html>

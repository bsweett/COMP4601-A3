The last time I watched "Snow White" it was when I was about 15yrs on my mom's old VHS copy, that was 9yrs ago, and I fell asleep half-way through it. However, considering "Snow White's" universal praise, I figured there must be something wrong with me, so I decided to watching it once again and see if it held my interest or not.<br /><br />  For me, this movie still remains an oddity, for me it is dated in its feel a lot more than any other major Disney Film, and yet it still holds great treasures and beauty in it.  The animation at first look seems to be extremely dates and grainy, but when taking a closer look, I realized the grainy aged look of the backgrounds were intentional.  Much like the artwork in "Sleeping Beauty" is fashioned after renaissance paintings, so "Snow White" is fashioned after paintings, in this case water color paintings.  The back drops have the distinct grainy look of water colors on water colors paper.  When I realized this, I began to appreciate this movie a great deal more because I now could see how much work really went in to the animation.  The rest of the animation for the most part looks like standard 1930's animation in its style, and especially in the movement of the animals resembles many cartoons of the times, but it rises far above those cartoons to become a cultural icon.<br /><br />  As for the story, it is very simple and follows for the most part, the traditional folk tale of Snow White (with some obvious changes).  Instead of trying to expand too much on the story and create a heavy drama, rather a sweet story of first love reminiscent of many other movies of the era is penned.  The pacing is quite slow even though the movie itself is only 78minutes and I am sure this is what made me fall asleep before and why it still at times fails to hold my attention; it is due to the slower pacing on of the 1930's and is not s fault of the writers I feel, if anything its a testament to the short attention spans of today.  The characters are little more than stock characters, but they are created in such a fun way that it almost feels like they originated from this movie.<br /><br />  The music and singing in the movie is very much a product of its time, but this adds to the charm of the film.  Every time I hear Snow White sing I am reminded of many other 1930's films and shows I've watched, and how the art of true singing has died away and given way to the popular belting/yelling technique.  The singing here is georgeous and the music is catchy and delightful!  Making things that could be mundane such as cleaning, washing faces, and working in to fun and memorable musical sequences!<br /><br />  The story, animation, and music work together to create a movie that will no doubt be loved until the end of the world, and this transfer does it great justice.  I did not have the opportunity to purchase the previous Platinum edition on DVD, and had only seen it ever on VHS, so this transfer on Blu-ray really allowed me to see its true quality as an animated movie.  The more I watch it the better and richer it gets, its astonishing and the clarity of the transfer and touch-ups is perfect!<br /><br />  I am not really one for extras on DVD and Blu-Ray, I generally just watch the movie, but there are some fun extras on here such as a fun gem game, deleted scenes that include the cut "Soup" scene, what was the possible sequel to "Snow White" and a lot more I haven't even gotten to yet.<br /><br />  If you're wondering if this is worth the money, I give it a resounding YES!  Take it from the girl who went went from Sleepy to Happy when it comes to how they feel about Snow White.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy</p></body></html>

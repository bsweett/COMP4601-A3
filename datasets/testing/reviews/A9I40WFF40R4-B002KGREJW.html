If you can see only one funny movie this summer-- I'm not sure what else is out there-- run to see this one while it's still in the cool theatres. Abigail Breslin, a runner-up in a local children's  beauty pageant, is thrust into the limelight when the winner renounces her title and this child must go across the country to enter the national "Little Miss Sunshine" beauty pageant finals. She is joined by her hyper-dysfunctional family: her father (Greg Kinnear), who is trying to sell his motivational message to the masses;  her mom ( Toni Collette); her gay uncle (Steve Carell), a Proust scholar who has just tried suicide-- he's even a failure at that-- her teenaged brother who has taken a vow of silence and only communicates by note pad; and finally her grandfather, who likes both sex and heroin (Alan Arkin). This over-the-top family travels in a VW van, in a laugh-a-minute trip that turns William Faulkner's novel AS I LAY DYING on its head.<br /><br />This movie spoofs a lot of things about America, not the least of which are those beauty pageants for toddlers and children. (My own hometown did have something called "Little Miss Petite Beauty Pageant".) Without giving away the plot, I'll just say what this child chooses for her entry in the talent competition (it has been a well-kept secret between her and her grandfather) will make you laugh out loud.<br /><br />This movie is not to be missed.</p></body></html>

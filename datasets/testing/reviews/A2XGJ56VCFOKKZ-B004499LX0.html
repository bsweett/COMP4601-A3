<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely Brilliant Beyond Words!"></head><body><p>When I saw this film in theaters I was completely blown away with it.  Before I even went to see it, I was impressed with the perfect casting of four actors whom I really enjoy watching on film:  Julia Roberts (as Anna), Natalie Portman (as Alice), Jude Law (as Dan), and Clive Owen (as Larry).  This one is really dialogue heavy in a way that pulls you in and never lets go.  Among the four actors, I think Natalie Portman pretty much owns this picture and her recent Golden Globe was well deserved (I hope she repeats on Sunday by nabbing the Best Supporting Actress Oscar).  The scenes of her in a private room of a strip club, bending her body in imaginative and seductive ways while still carrying on an intense and sexually charged conversation with Larry is an amazing scene for me.  To watch this film and "Garden State", you will be convinced that Natalie Portman is the actress of her generation and will only grow from here.<br /><br />Clive Owen is also great in this film and his character of Larry is the most conniving of the four.  The movie works to a brilliant resolution, in which is wicked knowledge of Anna's psychology is used to set up a rival for his former flame's affections (Dan).  Payback is a b...., as they say and well deserved in the case of pathetic Dan, who toys with people's emotions, pretending to be who he's not, especially in the Internet chatroom.<br /><br />While some people might not find any of the characters sympathetic or like the idea that people in relationships lie to one another, but I find a lot of what happens in this film to be true to life, in my own observations of people.  To live a completely honest life means one is going to be stepped on, taken advantaged of, and discarded when no longer convenient.  This film should serve as a wake up call to anyone that it sometimes takes cunning to win at the game of love.  The pathetic aspect of love is that no one wants to get hurt, yet too many don't see the hurt they cause in others.  This film is a brilliant case example, with top notch performances across the board.<br /><br />I'm shocked that one reviewer below called this film gay without the courage to state so at the end.  That's one interpretation, though I suppose it reveals more about the reviewer than anything else.  I certainly didn't get that impression from the film.<br /><br />See this film and hopefully it will inspire you to be honest in your dealings with other people...especially the ones you love the most.</p></body></html>

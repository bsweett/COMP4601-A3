<meta name="summary" content="Worst of the series so far, but still pretty good"></head><body><p>This film just didn't hang together as well as the first three, each of which was in my opinion a masterpiece.  For me, the story just wasn't as tight, the mystery of what was going on felt less alive, and for the first time the special effects seemed more important than the characters.  Even my daughter, who at 10 has read all the books and seen all the films with me, said, "Dad, that one just wasn't as good."  It was exactly how I felt, but then, she has always had to explain its intricacies to me, who will probably never read the books.  Moreover, this one is a bit too gory, and so we did not include our youngest, who at 6 would find it a bit disturbing or so we feared.<br /><br />In spite of that criticism, this film is still above average for a kid movie.  It is visually impressive, you know the characters, and the story line makes a decisive and ominous advance.  So overall, I would recommend this film.  We will definitely get for our collection, though will probably wait until the price goes down a lot more.</p></body></html>

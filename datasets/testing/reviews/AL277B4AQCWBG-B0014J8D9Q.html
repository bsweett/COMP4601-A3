<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant anti-Western"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning Western turns the genre entirely on its head. This west is a bleak moral vacuum, a place of anxious sized-obsessed men and violently determined women, where the creed of the cowboy gives way to the creed of the gangster. Villains aren't challenged to duels of skill, but slaughtered as they try to surrender. Virtually every man dies unarmed. The film could be enjoyed on a purely visceral level, but with its subplot about English Bob and his travelling 'biographer', screenwriter David Webb Peoples clearly has more in mind. His screenplay reflects on the Western as a myth-making genre, and suggests that the mythic conception of the American west is a fabrication woven from the exaggerated stories of braggarts and liars. His tale of Will Munny tells it like it probably was. It's a chilling world which has more in common with classical tragedy and the moral speculation of sci-fi. It's a world in which nobody wins, "we've all got it coming", and no one is forgiven.</p></body></html>

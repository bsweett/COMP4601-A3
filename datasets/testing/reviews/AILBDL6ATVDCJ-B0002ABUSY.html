I'm not saying this movie is terrible - not saying that at all.  But I think the movie relied too much on special effects and gore.<br /><br />One of the best ways to pull people into a movie is to make the characters likable.  I found myself not caring, even the slightest, whether any of the main character were ripped to shreds by the zombies.<br /><br />The movie "28 Days Later" managed to do a much better job with this concept.  The characters and dialogue were much more interesting.  I would recommend "28 Days Later" to anyone thinking of buying this film.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

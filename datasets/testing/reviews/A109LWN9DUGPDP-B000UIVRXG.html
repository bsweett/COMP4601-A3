<meta name="summary" content="This s_!#  just got real!!"></head><body><p>I was expecting this movie to be just ok even though I read so many great reviews becouse I liked Saun of the Dead but it wasnt that funny to me but it was still ok.So going into to this I thought it would probly be good but not great.Come to find out it was the latter.Through the first hour of this two hour film I thought I was right it was good and pretty funny up to that point and then it just totally took off for the next hour I was totally caught by surprise how funny it was and there was alot of off the wall action and some crazy death scene's in there so be for warned there is some violence in this movie but it's really cool violence.For me the second part of this movie is the most fun I've had with a movie in a long time I watched it again the next night.A must buy!</p></body></html>

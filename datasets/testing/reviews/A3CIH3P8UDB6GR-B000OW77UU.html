A real father and his son portraying in a movie about a father and son movie.  Above all, Will Smith.  Now, I remember him when Parents just didn't Understand.  But he won me over easily.  I felt his struggle.  Just when I think he would come out of it, something else happens.  It was like Keep kicking him when he's already down.  I thought Will Smith did a great and inspiring job.  His son was good, but Will Smith did an amazing job.  Hats off!! Great motivation piece of film with a message of never give up, by all means.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="TONY GILROY, OPUS 1"></head><body><p>****1/2 2007. Written and directed by Tony Gilroy. Academy award earned by Tilda Swinton and 6 other nominations. A powerful law firm gets rid of a lawyer who's about to tell the truth about a multibillion case. MICHAEL CLAYTON reminds us of the time of Alan J. Pakula's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IRE9">The Parallax View</a> or Sydney Pollack's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305511055">Three Days of the Condor</a>, a time when American producers weren't afraid to combine the hope for profit and smart screenplays. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hippie Slacker with Bowling Ball"></head><body><p>Two young brothers from cold Minnesota must have had a rich fantasy life in the midst of mid-western snowstorms.  Their Fargo was a sly satire of prairie folks.  But before there were Fargo and Academy Awards, there was The Big Lebowski, which for actor Jeff Bridges is his signature career role, The Dude.<br /><br />The plot is a LA, Raymond Chandler style mystery; it's hard to tell the bad guys and femme fatales without a scorecard.<br /><br />The similarities stop there.  Dude is a middle aged longhaired, hippy slacker with a bowling ball. His pal John Goodman is a Vietnam freak-out converted to Judaism.  Together they meet the Fritz brothers, the nympho-artist, and assorted freaks on the way to solving a mystery that really doesn't matter.  This one is for laughs.</p></body></html>

The acting is very good here. Emile Hirsch is fantastic as the lead character and looks to have a promising career ahead of him. Vince Vaughn and especially Hal Holbrook are great supporting characters as well. The music (mostly by Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder) fits the movie like a glove. While sad and depressing at times, Into the Wild will either move you, or have you moving for the exits.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

So opens the 1970 Oscar-winning film 'Patton' directed by Franklin J. Schaffner; giving the audience an early insight into the mind of one of America's greatest generals.  A well-directed film enhanced by the spectacular performance of George C. Scott who has an uncanny resemblance to the actual person.<br /><br />The film faithfully and candidly presents the life of America's most cunning WWII general as described by his fellow officer General Bradley in his memoirs and Patton's own autobiography.  The film shows how he was a commander whom even great German generals such as Erwin Rommel feared and respected.  It shows him as a controversial figure who, although an ardent Christian, believed in reincarnation.  Bellicose and foul mouthed, Patton was his own worst enemy in the Pentagon and on the political scene: foiling many opportunities for him to be assigned a command on the front.  The film also shows how he became a controversial leader with his own troops for reprimanding a shell-shocked soldier as a coward.  The film follows his exploits in Operation Torch in North Africa, the invasion of Sicily and Italy, and some of his activities in Northern Europe.  The film also shows how Patton had a pretty low opinion of Montgomery as a man and as a military commander: they were both bitter rivals throughout the war.<br /><br />This is not really a war film but strictly a dramatic biography on one whose business happened to be war.  The few combat action scenes in the film are decent and well balanced in contrast to the main character; the cinematography is also quite good.  Under good direction by Schaffner, George C. Scott delivers a winning performance to a role he was literally born to play.  A great film deserving an honored place in any war film buff's collection.</p></body></html>

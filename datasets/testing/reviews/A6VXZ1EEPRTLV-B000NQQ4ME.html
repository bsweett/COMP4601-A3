<meta name="summary" content="brutal and brilliant, Mel Gibson's triumph may engender self-reflection..."></head><body><p>No matter what you may think of Mel Gibson as a person, his film Apocalypto (2006) is truly an example of superb storytelling, and the realization of a vision to bring to the screen a period piece involving the Mayan culture, that is epic in scale, and brutally realistic, as a marauding band of warriors raids the jungle and gathers slaves.<br /><br />Set somewhere in the jungles of Central America, the movie's cast speak an archaic language, wear authentic attire, and use ancient tools and weapons.  Tattoos, scarification, piercing, and the insertion of objects into parts of the body, particularly the nose and ear lobe, were part of the Mayan culture, and a large crew of makeup artists, was employed to give the huge cast an authentic look.  Unfolding in stages, the story immediately draws you in, and is largely a learning experience, for those unfamiliar with the Mayan culture.  The acting performances are amazingly natural, and there are few instances where you don't feel that what you are seeing isn't real.  The pacing is brisk, and the story is told in a manner that feels like events are happening almost in real time.<br /><br />Events are centered on a young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the son of Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), one of the leaders of a tribe living in the jungle.  With the goal of capturing alive as many of the adults as possible, a group of warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), and his lieutenant Middle Eye (Gerardo Teracena), attack Jaguar Paw's tribe.  The struggle is furious, brutal, and heartbreaking, as the film brilliantly captures the pure panic, naked fear, and cruel violence, as the tribe is overrun, struggles to resist, and is overcome by the superior force.<br /><br />During the fray, Jaguar Paw manages to lower his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and his son into a deep pit, where they barely escape detection.  After watching his father leave on the journey to great beyond, Jaguar Paw and his fellow prisoners are bound together, and forced to trek through the jungle, abandoning the children of the village to fend for themselves.  Eventually they reach a great city, where the women are sold as slaves, and the men are forced to climb to the top of a massive ziggurat, where a sacrificial ceremony is taking place.  To appease the god Kukulkan, prisoners are held down, and their hearts are cut out.  The men are then beheaded, and their bodies flung down to crash the bottom.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is on the altar, on the verge of meeting this fate, when a solar eclipse occurs.  Taken as a sign that the deity has been satisfied, Jaguar Paw and the remaining prisoners are spared, and taken to sandy field.  In pairs, they are given a chance to run to freedom, dodging the spears and arrows of the enemy warriors.  Killing one of Zero Wolf's sons, a wounded Jaguar Paw manages to escape into the jungle, pursued by Zero Wolf and a group of warriors.  The last act of the film features Jaguar Paw in a transcendental journey, as he runs for his life, and attempts to save his family.<br /><br />In regard to sets, costumes, language, and culture, Apocalypto goes to great lengths, attempting to be realistic.  Combined with some remarkably convincing acting performances, and often brutal action scenes, and you may find yourself drawn quite deeply into this unfamiliar, and often violent world, which is very close to nature.  Apocalypto is a compelling and often shocking saga, that makes a sincere attempt to explore and pay respect to an ancient culture, while telling a poignant, tragic, and thrilling story.  There are some very rough moments, but if you persevere, you may discover a new appreciation for the simple things in life, that you might have taken for granted.</p></body></html>

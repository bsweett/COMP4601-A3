<meta name="summary" content="An unexpected comic masterpiece"></head><body><p>In the current film market, the "guy picture" and the films of Tyler Perry are the two hottest sub-genres of comedy out there.  Thanks to Judd Apatow's smashing successes, the litany of comedies focusing on the trials and tribulations of young men teetering on the brink of manhood (even those well into their 30s) is impressive - "Knocked Up," "40-Year Old Virgin," "Wedding Crashers," "Superbad," "Pineapple Express," and on and on.<br /><br />Smashing through the pack is Todd Philips' "The Hangover."  There may not be a more classic setup for a buddy flick - a bachelor party in Vegas gone horribly wrong.  But I cannot think of a recent film that has taken a more stodgy premise and injected such brilliant and unexpected hilarity into the mix.<br /><br />We know from the first scene that things have gone wrong:  a bleeding guy stands in the middle of the desert, calmly explaining to a nervous bride-to-be that he's lost her fiance and the wedding ain't gonna happen.  We think, sure - we've seen this before.<br /><br />No we haven't.<br /><br />Cut to the guys getting ready to hit Vegas.  The fiance, Doug (Justin Bartha ("National Treasure") is a pretty good guy.  His two best friends are Stu (Ed Helms, "The Office") and Phil (Bradley Cooper, "Wedding Crashers").  Stu is a hen-pecked guy who's lied to his controlling girlfriend - she honestly thinks he's taking Doug to a bachelor party in Napa (serves her right).  Phil is a teacher frustrated by his job and his marriage and is just dying for a night of depravity.<br /><br />But there is a fourth guy along for the ride - Alan (Zach Galifianakis), the soon-to-be brother-in-law.  In a lesser movie, Alan would quite simply steal the whole shooting match.  Galifianakis combines the zaniness of John Belushi with the untrammelled sweet innocence of Michael Cera.  Alan is not quite right - starved for friendship, socially maladroit, and fanatically loyal.  The first sign of trouble comes when the guys agree to take shots from Alan's booze on top of a Vegas hotel/casino.<br /><br />The brilliance of the movie comes from the next scene - the guys wake up in a completely trashed hotel suite.  But there are signs of a true blowout - broken tables, a burning sofa, a baby in the closet and a tiger in the bathroom.  And a missing fiance.<br /><br />The rest of the movie involves Stu, Phil and Alan trying to track down Doug in Vegas even though nobody can remember a single thing from the night before.  The twists and turns involve Vegas crime lords, a sweet prostitute (Heather Graham), and Mike Freaking Tyson.<br /><br />This movie is hilarious from start to finish.  Fast moving, perfectly cast, and always unexpected, "The Hangover" benefits from perfect comic performances from the entire cast.  It's not a surprise to see either Ed Helms or Bradley Cooper in a hilarious movie, but to see Galifianakis graduate from "Out Cold" and various "Reno 911" episodes to the comic big time is a pure pleasure.<br /><br />Get this movie!</p></body></html>

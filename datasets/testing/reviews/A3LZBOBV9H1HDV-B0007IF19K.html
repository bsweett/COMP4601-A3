Jamie Foxx is brilliant as Ray Charles, in his best role to date and he deserved the Golden Globe award and he deserved the Oscar and the SAG award. Taylor Hackford's directing is brilliant, one of his best films to date, as well. Powerfully emotional and worth remembering. The rest of the cast was brilliant as well. "Ray" is one of last year's best films!</p></body></html>

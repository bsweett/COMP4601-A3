<meta name="summary" content="The Stuff Dreams are made Of"></head><body><p>"The Maltese Falcon" is a great movie because of its great actors and tight dialogue.  Bogart, as the cynical but ultimately ultramoral, Sam Spade, is great as are his antitheses, Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and Mary Astor.  Spade is suckered by a beautiful woman [Astor] into what turns out to be the criminal enterprise of locating the 'Maltese Falcon', a ceramic bird worth millions.  Men and women fight and die to gain its possession.<br /><br />The plot is convoluted but convincing and, finally, after the murder of several illicit wealth-seekers, the Falcon is located it and is found to be a phony.  The cops lead the beautiful Astor who, while still proclaiming her 'love' for Bogart, off to her well-deserved punishment.  Bogart, as Spade, has the opportunity to set her free but...does the 'right' thing and refuses to save her.  Still, the last lines of the film really turn it from a good detective film to a great one.  When asked what the worthless ceramic bird is all about, Spade answers, "The stuff dreams are made of."<br /><br />Dreams, after all, aren't really about wealth.  They are about pursuit.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

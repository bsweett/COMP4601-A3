And the streak solidly continues with Lady In The Water.<br /><br />According to an interview that I heard Shyamalan do on The Howard Stern Show last summer, Lady In The Water was actually planned as a Disney Touchstone studio release and also shunned by other big Hollywood studios. It was a film that Shyamalan had wanted to make, but kept getting brickwalled by the studios. Finally, Warner Brother embraced the idea.<br /><br />Perhaps Touchstone thought that Shyamalan was on a downward spiral after the disappointing box office result of The Village two years ago. And The Village was indeed a mediocre-at-best movie. Ultimately, Touchstone doesn't look bad for passing on Lady In The Water based on the film's budget to its box office take. The bad press, bad blood, mediocre previous release all hanging over The Lady In The Water really hurt the box office success of the film.<br /><br />So the question is: what constitutes success?...A very good movie or a very good box office take? Well, one thing's for sure: Lady In The Water is definitely the former.<br /><br />The movie is well acted. Paul Giamatti is stellar; no one can say that this guy is just a character actor...he's without doubt as A-list as it gets. And his performance in Lady just reinforces my opinion.<br /><br />The movie is scary. I hate movies that rely on a lot of "jumps out of the dark accompanied by a loud bong" to scare the viewer, and Lady indeed does that a few times. But redemption is served in a thrilling, suspenseful, creepy overtone to the whole movie. And the movie is full of deliberate comic relief that works perfectly.<br /><br />Shyamalan says that this was a bedtime story (and is portrayed as such in the movie, albeit a come-to-life bedtime story) that he used to tell or was told as a young child (can't remember which). No wonder all his movies are so creepy.<br /><br />I'm sorry that I rented this instead of adding to my library. I was clearly caught up in the "Shyamalan downward spiral" unjustified hype. Lady In The Water is definitely worthy of collection.</p></body></html>

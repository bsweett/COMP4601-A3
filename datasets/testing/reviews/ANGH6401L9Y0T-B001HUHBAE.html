<meta name="summary" content="Very Well Done Telling of a True Story I Remember"></head><body><p>If you like detective stories, or investigation stories, this is the movie of the year. I may be biased, because I lived in San Francisco when the Zodiac resurfaced after years of silence, and when the book was written about it. This movie is a pretty darn accurate account of a true story.<br /><br />This is a story of obsession: the obsession of the Zodiac killer is one thing. The obsession of certain people who investigated the murders, especially the one who did not give up, and eventually wrote the book about it, is the other.<br /><br />It's not an unduly gory movie, really. There is blood, and there are killings, but they are not over-emphasized. It's just part of the story. There are the methods detectives use, and there are the methods reporters use, and the ways they work together, and the ways they conflict. Like when the cop who "cannot discuss an open investigation" with an investigative journalist (editorial cartoonist, originally) says "So I can't tell you to go see so-and-so in Vallejo."<br /><br />According to the movie, the cartoonist turned investigator lost his wife over his obsession with this case, and her fear that he was making himself a target for a killer. The reporter who got fired for drinking after he was threatened personally by Zodiac was the cartoonist's friend, and he eventually went completely down the tubes.<br /><br />The police did investigate the man who eventually turned out to be the Zodiac, interviewed him, searched his trailer and found some pretty good circumstantial evidence. But the handwriting expert cleared him, so they dropped him from their list of suspects, although at least one police investigator continued to consider him their best suspect. How the cartoonist eventually found the evidence that convinced him and the top cop on the investigation (after he was removed from the case) is the most fascinating part of the story. But still, it was circumstantial evidence, and the fact that one handwriting expert had cleared him stood in their way. Another said not to rule him out on the basis of handwriting analysis.<br /><br />Did you know the crime was never officially solved? It's pretty clear who did it, yes, but the evidence was not gathered that could officially charge him with it, and he died before he could be prosecuted.<br /><br />I was completely absorbed in this story, and recommend it to anyone who likes crime and detective stories</p></body></html>

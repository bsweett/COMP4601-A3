Not really inspired.<br />As for movie itself - flashbacks into history nicely incorporated, action in present so much slower than the book, the real reason for enstrangement between Sauniere and Sophie not REALLY explained (while crucial to the story of the sacred feminine), meaning of Sophie's name not explained (also important for the whole premise of the book).<br />Too long in length, too little content, too lil action (compared to book).<br />When the movie played in your head while reading the book outshines the Hollywood production, result is disappoinment. So with this film.</p></body></html>

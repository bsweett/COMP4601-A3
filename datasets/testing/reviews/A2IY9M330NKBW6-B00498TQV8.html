<meta name="summary" content="I'll Stay out of Missouri Thank You"></head><body><p>This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen and it isn't even a horror movie. It's set in Missouri near the Ozarks and it deals with a teenaged girl who has to track down her dad. He's due in court on drug charges. He used their house as collateral on his bond. If he doesn't show, sis, her younger brother and sister and vegetablized mom are out on the street (or in the woods as it applies here). So she sets out to find his old haunts, friends and family (very little difference there) so she can track him down.<br /><br />This is a powerful film. And it's lean. No fancy sets or special effects. It's all writing and acting. Jennifer Lawrence plays the lead. She's a nice girl, but she's street smart, tough and nobody's fool. She confronts all manner of people unflinchingly to get the answers she needs. John Hawkes is one of her dad's cousins who knows the kind of trouble she's getting into but helps anyway. Garrett Dillahunt plays the local cop who really screws things up. These are just a few of a really fine cast that infuse nearly every scene with a sense of menace.<br /><br />They bring the "everyone's related, trailer trash" thing to the fore and do not even attempt to make it politically correct. These are dirty, nasty, drug making, drug selling, drug using, mean spirited people who are no strangers to death and killing. Most of the people she talks to are related to her to some degree or another but would kill her if they had to.<br /><br />Most of it takes place outdoors, during the winter, or in these nasty shacks. That alone puts the viewer on edge. Add to that all the other assorted foulness and this becomes a very scary movie.<br /><br />I love these kinds of movies because they remind me of how much can be done in film with so very little. The right script, actors and director and you have a gem like this. Try putting this on next Halloween instead of your favorite horror movie and see how well you sleep that night.</p></body></html>

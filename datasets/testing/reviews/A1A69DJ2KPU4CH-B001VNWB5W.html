<meta name="summary" content="Animated Graphic Novel the Black Freighter Adds Nothing To DC"></head><body><p>So I just picked up the Ultimate Edition at Fry's for $14.95 yesterday. The price was too good to pass up, but it is not the Blu Ray edition, as they were all sold out. Still, this Ultimate Cut was over half the price I paid when it first came out, so I thought it was a good deal. Heck, as of this writing you can't even get it from a third party seller for the price I paid. I guess Fry's just wants to get rid of the remaining stock and are selling these at cost just to move them. There were two more copies left after I bought mine. Considering it's run its course, and is no longer being made, I view it as sort of a collectors item. I didn't buy it when it came out because I thought it was too expensive, and I had already purchased the DC edition, and that was in addition to the theatrical version I had purchased earlier. I was not about to be the studio's next sucker by purchasing another edition. I really hate the way the studio's milk popular movies by releasing so many editions of a movie, with often the most desirable coming out last. Since I don't see movies in theaters any more, and I really wanted to see Watchmen when it came out, so I jumped at the theatrical version as soon as it hit DVD knowing full well there were going to be better versions coming out later. I had waited long enough. Thankfully the DC had enough new content that it warranted the purchase, but the Ultimate Edition not so much. At least not the movie.<br /><br />Speaking of the movie, this Ultimate Edition version is the DC with an animated graphic novel interspersed throughout the movie. While I thought the Black Freighter was cool, as the title of my review suggests, it brought nothing worthwhile to the DC of the movie. I guess in some way it was supposed to parallel the struggles Rorschach deals with throughout the movie, but honestly, you are no worse for the wear without it. Which in my opinion means the DC is really the ultimate edition of the movie. The Black Freighter as a completely separate movie would be cool, especially because it could be more fleshed out than what we get in Watchmen. All the Black Freighter did was to make a long movie (DC version) even longer with no real payoff for your time. Again, I paid very little for this edition, so it's no big deal to me, but I am also keeping my DC version and will watch that when I'm in the mood for a Watchmen re-watch.<br /><br />However, it's not just the inclusion of the Ultimate Cut movie you get, but so much extra that the package becomes even more desirable. I will admit I haven't even gotten around to all of the extra content, and there is a lot of it! 360 minutes of extra content on disc two, and 325 minutes of extra content on discs three and four. Those last two discs I'm especially interested in, as they are the Watchmen comics brought to life, all 12 issues. As we all know, Watchmen is simply one of the most important, well written, well animated graphic novel's ever, so seeing them brought to life with motion (albeit limited motion from the box description) and voice work is going to be cool indeed. That alone would be worthy of the purchase, but I also look forward to disc two, which contains lots of cool content as well.<br /><br />Disc five is a bummer, for me at least. The digital copy expired as of November 10th, 2010 so I'm SOL with that one. Might also be the reason Fry's is selling the Ultimate Cut so cheap, as really, the digital copy is worthless. Truthfully, it's doubtful I would have copied it to my computer anyway, for one I'm nervous about DRM content infecting my computer, and why would I want to watch the movie on a 17" monitor when I have my 32" LED-LCD HDTV no more than 10 feet from me in my living room? Answer, I wouldn't. The digital copy is already in the trash, it's worthless and so I threw it out.<br /><br />All in all, this Ultimate Cut edition is great for the extra content, but not for the movie, for that the DC is more than sufficient. If I had spent $35 on the Ultimate Cut, which is what it cost when it first came out, not sure I would have been happy about that, but $15, I'm okay with it. If you are not a die hard Watchmen fan and you already own the DC, I would say you can safely skip this Ultimate Cut, but for the die hard Watchmen fans I feel there is enough extra content to warrant the purchase, but not at the prices third party sellers are asking, that's for sure. If you really want this edition take a trip to Fry's ASAP, if you have a store where you live, I'm sure they are priced the same at all of them.</p></body></html>

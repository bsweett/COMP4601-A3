<meta name="summary" content="a trip out film"></head><body><p>been waiting to watch this film for some time and it lived up to the hype for me. it reminded me of a small town version of clueless and a couple of other films,but the spin and the way things fall into place in this film truly was on point. so much confussion and it seems that all the characters in this film weren't sure of much and that is what made Juno who was a complicated chracter in herself so compelling because she tied all things together and made it work. abittersweat film with humor and saddness.very cleaver film and modern,but with a throwback quality and feel.</p></body></html>

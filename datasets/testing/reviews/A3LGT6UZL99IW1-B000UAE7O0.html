<meta name="summary" content="At least it was entertaining"></head><body><p>Look, when I plop down $$ to see a flick, or pay even more $$$ to purchase the DVD - especially when it's by these director's, I don't want art.  I want entertainment.  If I want art, I'll let my girlfriend pick the flick.  I want entertainment and action.  Death Proof was just plain painful to endure.<br /><br />Planet terror, part two of the double billing, is fun, but I could do without the fake file burn, missing reel, scratched, color washes and the like.  The cameo appearances are cool, and the gunfights are typical of the old drive-ins:  a revolver shoots 20 rounds, etc.  I hardly used the >> button at all. The movie unabashedly rips off zombie flicks, Samurai Jack (The Scotsman's Machine Gun Leg), and others - just like those old films did.<br /><br />I've wasted more money on worse movies.  If you like zombie flicks, Bruce Willis, or strippers with full-auto appendages, then this is an enjoyable way to spend around 80 minutes.<br /><br />The fake trailer for Machete was fantastic - especially the bike mounted Vulcan mingun!</p></body></html>

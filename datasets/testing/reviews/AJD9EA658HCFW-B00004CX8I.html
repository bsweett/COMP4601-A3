<meta name="summary" content="Classic Film"></head><body><p>"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a classic film. The acting by Jack Nicholson (R.P. McMurphy) and Louise Fletcher (Nurse Ratched) is wonderful !! Also, the supporting cast did a great job!<br />"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is about a man (R.P. McMurphy) who is transfered to a mental institution, for testing to determine if he is "insane" or not. McMurphy, who is no more then a rebel goes through many obsticles and adventures during the film that are very funny, and yet some serious and sad.<br />"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is very deserving of the best-picture award it won in 1975 along with other awards won.<br />This is a must-see film that is satisfying to all types of audiences.</p></body></html>

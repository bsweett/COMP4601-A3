<meta name="summary" content="Who Started the REVOLUTIONs?"></head><body><p>I honestly have to admit: I don't understand what all the critical panning of THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is about.  I'll concede that the first hour almost plays like a "Last time we last saw Neo" introduction, and the Wachowskis might've gone back to the drawing board to "revolutionize" a stronger opening.  However, at the time of working on the picture(s), perhaps they didn't have a clear-cut breaking point between the two storylines, and, thus, the opening of REVOLUTIONS suffers from too much exposition.  Some of it is has the feel of a manufactured recap, hinting that reshoots might've been performed after they agreed on the two films' midpoint.<p>Still, once the action begins, the action begins, and the non-stop blow-out (and blow-ups!) are technically as sophisticated as anything revealed in the first MATRIX film.  While not quite capturing lightning in a bottle the way they did with the first outing, the Wachowskis manage to pull out all of the stops to give serious 'Matrixiles' a grand send-off to this slightly uneven trilogy.<p>The theology slant was, in my humble opinion, an obvious set-up to the conclusion.  When fanboys and fangals everywhere were expecting the probable "ship in a bottle" virtual reality tie-up (myself included, to a point), the Wachowskis managed to veer off toward the "other" logical plotline to tie up the loose ends.  Little did we know that, at the end of the stellar first film, we were actually being shown an allegory for Christ's struggle on behalf on mankind.  Sure, the foundation was there, but it played out winningly through REVOLUTIONS.<p>If REVOLUTIONS has any great strength, then it would have to be creating a hunger to go back and rewatch the first and second installments for hints, clues, and foreshadowing that will inevitably appear on subsequent viewings.  While that isn't the kind of brick to build a franchise around, it certainly didn't hurt this cyber-driven action trilogy.</p></body></html>

If your man loved movies such as "Bad Boys 1 &2," "Enemy of the State," "Mission Impossible," or any other high action movies, then "Collatoral" will be for them.  I watched this film with my husband.  I admit the film was good, but awefully predictable at times.  He was very disapointed when before the movie even got started good I revealed plot twists.  It could be that because I am a writer I had a keen insight of how the story would unfold.  Anyway, it was a good movie and Tom Cruise played a really good bad guy and it was interesting to see Jamie Foxx not being cool or a tough guy, he was fantastic as a humble cab driver.  I enjoyed this film.  There was a lot of action, it was high paced, and exciting at times.</p></body></html>

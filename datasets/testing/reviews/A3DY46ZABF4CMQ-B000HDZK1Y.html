<meta name="summary" content="Like Napolean, Nacho Libre is definitely a winner!"></head><body><p>Jared Hess, the man behind 2004's sleeper hit Napolean Dynamite, returns with the explosively hilarious comedy, Nacho Libre.<br /><br />Jack Black (King Kong, School of Rock) plays Ignacio, known as Nacho, an orphan raised at a Mexican monestary, and assigned to serve the orphanage by cooking the food for the children. However, Nacho has other ambitions in life, and that is to become a successful wrestler, and win the heart of the new nun, the beautiful Encarnacion, played by Ana de la Reguera. He picks out a wrestling partner, a skinny homeless bum named Esqueleto, played by Hector Jimenez, dons a suit and mask and goes out secretly at night to the rings, fights it out, loses, and makes some serious money. He eyes the greatest fighter Ramses, played by Cesar Gonzalez, as his next opponent because if he wins he'll make enough money to buy the monestary a bus for the children to go on trips, and prove to Encarnacion and everybody else that wrestling is not a sin.<br /><br />Jack Black is hilarious as Nacho Libre. However, the best thing about the movie is Jared Hess's unconventional directing, made famous in Napolean Dynamite, the film's quirky dialogue and punch lines, and the one-dimensional character's personalities and body languages.<br /><br />Like Napolean, Nacho Libre is definitely a winner!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></body></html>

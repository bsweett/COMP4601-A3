<meta name="summary" content="Trailer was the movie."></head><body><p>Someone once said- This is the movie that is defined by its trailer... Once you have seen the trailer, you have seen the movie.  I think it was me after viewing it for the first time.  I bought this movie on reputation and after a single viewing, was very disappointed.  But upon further review, since friends would request it, the movie grew on me.  The Edger suit bit was just to funny.  The constant interaction between Smith and Jones was fun.  The bit with the morgue doctor... the flashy thing.  <p>In the end, this is a good movie, not great, but recommended.<p>To bad the sequel was bad.</p></body></html>

The four leads all do well, but it's a little jarring to see portly Jack Black trying to play a romantic leading man against Jude Law. Still, Black really ain't half bad here. The swelling music contributes to the overall throwback feel. They even throw in a dose of Hollywood self-glorification with Eli Wallach as the 90-year-old screenwriter rescued from oblivion by an adoring Kate Winslett. We must endure her in the throes of worship for the old films the old codger wrote. Ick. Get over yourself, Hollywood. My main quibble is that it drags on for 2 hours 15 minutes when it could easily have been cut to 90 and been a more taut work.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="TEDIOUS & POINTLESS - $130 M WASTED ON JUNK"></head><body><p>A mish-mash and hodge-podge of half-baked notions and confusing set-pieces and laboriously lame atempts at humor.  The two leads can't act and seem uncomfortable in the extreme.  Cameron Diaz looks cute but has nothing to do.  James Franco pops in briefly, probably relieved.  Terrific actors Tom Wilkinson and Christoph Waltz do their best with the inept script (again Rogen).<br /><br />An opportunity missed to not go back to the 30s and do it in the pseudo-serious style of the great radio show.<br /><br />$130 million wasted and no one at the studio with enough creative nerve to say "this stinks."  Sad.</p></body></html>

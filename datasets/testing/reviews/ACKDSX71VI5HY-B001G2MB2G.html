<meta name="summary" content=""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" overcomes some missteps to retain the overall series' high quality"></head><body><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" works very well in spite of a rushed script, and a gripping climax pushes it into very nice maintenance of the series' extraordinarily high standards of quality.  First-time series director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg present largely top-notch work.<br /><br />The movie's titular 'Order of the Phoenix' is an honor guard of highly decorated Hogwarts teachers and associates who have sworn to protect Harry from the growing threat of a strengthening Lord Voldemort.  In a choppy movie from a narrative point of view, the Order of the Phoenix itself is somewhat a victim of fast cuts and general shortcomings.  It does provide a window into Grimmauld Place, the expressively dark family manse of Harry's godfather Sirius Black.  Gary Oldman again delivers a nuanced performance in what is a very important film for his character.<br /><br /> Simultaneously one of this movie's strengths and weaknesses, The Ministry of Magic ensures Harry will have enemies inside Hogwarts as well as outside of it.  Due to creative shortcuts, the Ministry is often glossed over in the film.  Ironically, in the book Ms. Rowling spends too much time expounding on it.  A balance could have and should have been achieved.  In the person of Dolores Umbridge, though, falsely sweet insincerity has a monstrous voice.  The name itself can mean 'painful offense.' Esteemed actress Imelda Staunton plays the character very well.<br /><br />Returning actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint again deliver natural camaraderie and acting skills, and are joined by returning colleagues Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.  Messrs Radcliffe and Rickman have an impressive scene together as Professor Snape ruthlessly attempts to train Harry to resist Voldemort's violent encroachments into his mind.<br /><br />Series newcomer Evanna Lynch makes a positive impression as Luna Lovegood, the offbeat sweetheart whose odd pronouncements always carry an ironic kernel of wisdom.  It's a difficult part to play believably, and Ms. Lynch does so extremely well.<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is very, very good.</p></body></html>

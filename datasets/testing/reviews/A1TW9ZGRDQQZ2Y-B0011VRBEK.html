<meta name="summary" content="What a Twisted Gem of a Film"></head><body><p>I just caught this film on DVD after hearing much hype over the last couple of years and I wasn't let down. The acting was very good and the twist was unique (though I did predict it before it was revealed). This film may be a disturbing to some, even though it leaves more up to the imagination in terms of actually showing the gore. If you are in the mood for an original movie that will likely leave you a little depressed, then give Oldboy a try. When the film ends, you can at least be optimistic about how your life isn't half as bad as it could be. Just look at the dude in Oldboy for a reference.</p></body></html>

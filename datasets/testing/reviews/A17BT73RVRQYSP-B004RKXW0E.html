<meta name="summary" content="Quality stuff"></head><body><p>Toy story 3 is a fine finish to the franchise a movie that tugs at every possible heartstring that exists, and adds just enough drama to make it unforgettable.<br /><br />Andy is going off to college and it becomes D-Day for the toys, who will end up in the attic, who will be donated, who will be trashed and what lucky few will come with him?<br /><br />There are several excellent scenes, and a few adult gags involving fashion.  The initial pre-school & "Latin lover" scenes are priceless.<br /><br />My only complaint is this.  It was established in Toy Story 2 that Buzz is a very valuable toy.  I think that should have been a factor in what was going on.<br /><br />On and the featurette Night and Day was absolutely fabulous.  It was in the best traditions of the cartoons of the 40's and 50's.  More of those please.</p></body></html>

The second problem that he is faced with  is in the form of  certain Russian science wacko, Ivan Vanko ( Mickey Rourke ) colluding with a ratty Sam Rockwell, then there are the usual chemical attractions with his assistant ( Pepper Potts) Gwyneth Paltrow. Scarlett Johansson, along with Don Cheadle and Samuel Jackson trying to get him to join Avengers ( new movie) keep things afloat.<br />The first hour was great and the action fast paced to keep things interesting, some have claimed that they found the first half was boring. I thought it could have been more engaging than the first one especially if the goal is to make the sequel better than the original and not just make pots of money trading on the past glories. I found it simply okay.....Three stars...6/8/10</p></body></html>

Highly recommend for fans of the film.<br /><br />DVD REVIEW BELOW:<br /><br />David Lean blossomed as a film director during the 50's. While he directed a number of earlier classics during the 40's, Bridge on the River Kwai was the first of many epic films that never lost the most important part of any epic tale--the human element.<br /><br />Although "Bridge" is inspired by a true story keep in mind that this isn't a documentary of the events that occurred there and Lean uses it to tell a dramatic story about survival, pride and the insanity of war. Novelist Pierre Boulle was a prisoner of war in Thailand and used the story of the building of the bridge as a backdrop for a fictionalized portrayal of those events combining them with his experience as a POW and the people that Boulle knew as a POW.<br /><br />Bridge focuses on the Japanese attempt to build a bridge linking their railroad through a perilous jungle in Southeast Asia. The prisoners of war are used essentially as slave labor to reach this goal. Colonel Nicholson(Alec Guinness who won an Oscar)are captured with his British troops. Nicholson's  can-do attitude creates a myopic outlook which prevents him from seeing that he is collaborating with the enemy when he agrees to help complete the bridge. It's the infusion that Japanese Prison Commander Saito needs; his prisoner worker population is shrinking rapidly. Dysintery, Malaria, heatstroke and other inhabitants of the jungle have killed most of the workers. The bridge is behind schedule and the Colonel Saito is very displeased.<br /><br />One of the last remaining prisoners is Shears (played with marvelous cynicism by William Holden). He just wants to do as little as possible and return home alive and well from the war. He has an escape plan. When he informs Nicholson of this, he's told that the British will not attempt to escape as there "is no place to escape to". Nicholson feels they'll be better treated in the camp and doesn't want his troops to face the harsh jungle. He orders his troops not to escape given the circumstances.<br /><br />Shears and two other prisoners make a break for it. Of the three only Shears survives, is shot and eventually found within Allied territory. He's taken to a British stronghold to recover. Shears provides info on the bridge. He doesn't want become involved in an effort to go back and blow it up. Blackmailed by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins)he ends up volunteering for the mission with Warden and one other American.<br /><br />Lean's direction captures the atmosphere of the jungle perfectly. While amazon.com rates the image as a 4 out of 5, I'd give it a 3. While a restoration effort was attempted, it's nowhere near as complete as that done for Lawrence of Arabia (another Lean film)or Hitchcock's Vertigo and Rear Window. Bridge has a much more brutal look which captures the essence of the jungle and the odds facing Shears and Warden. On the other hand, the film has a lot of analog artifacts and, although I can't be certain, looks like the negative has faded a bit. While it isn't in as bad a condition as Lawrence (or Vertigo)was, it certainly could use a face lift to improve the appearence.<br /><br />The sound is pretty good overall. Columbia has expanded the original soundtrack into a Dolby 5.1 master and, while it doesn't take advantage of the full range, it coulds much better than the earlier VHS edition.<br /><br />There are two editions of this classic film. The first has a second disc full of worthwhile extras that includes behind the scenes footage, a documentary on the film, appreciation by director John Millius many more items. The two disc set is certainly worthwhile for fans of the film.<br /><br />The single disc edition is a dual layer like the first disc of the two disc set. It looks like it came from the same master. It features the full film, trailers and a brief talent biography on Holden, Guinness, Hawkins and Lean. It hasn't been updated since Guinness' death a couple of years ago. It's not bare bones but for the price difference it should suffice for most fans. It features the same interactive menu (a clever use of actual scenes from the movie)and a motion scene selection.<br /><br />Bridge is a great film and it's certainly worthwhile in either edition. Which one you purchase depends on how much of a fan you are of the film and whether or not you'll watch the background material more than one time. The picture and sound are very good but it's also clear that Columbia sound undertake a more complete restoration of the this classic film.<br /><br />Oh, a bit of trivia--the main titles have been changed. When the film was released screenwriters Michael Wilson (Lawrence of Arabia, Planet of the Apes) and Carl Foreman (The Guns of Navarone)were still blacklisted writers in Hollywood. Novelist Piere Boulle (who spoke no English)fronted for them receiving screenplay credit and received the Oscar for screenplay. It's only fitting that their names have finally been added to the opening credits. This happened shortly before Foreman's death (if I'm not mistaken)so at least one of them lived to see a wrong righted. Both (or their heirs)also finally received their Oscars with their names engraved. It was fitting given the film's themes and the price the main character (a stand in, no doubt, for both Wilson and Foreman)pays in the film.</p></body></html>

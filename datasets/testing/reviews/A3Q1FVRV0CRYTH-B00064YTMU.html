<meta name="summary" content="Theres so much to this movie it's insane..."></head><body><p>I watched this movie last night and I have to say that it rose far above my expectations.  I expected a lot because of all the hype, but I didn't expect this much.  First off I want to say that Jamie Foxx is somewhat of a hidden trick, I mean, this guy has been around for almost ever and he all of a sudden comanded your attention.  It's almost like he woke up last year and said "dang, I really need to do something great" and so he did, with this movie.  My favorite part for Foxx is when his charactor meets with some thugs.  You can see this is the point in the movie when he really BECOMES his charactor.  Anyways, I wanted to say that, and then again I feel I need to point out that Tom Cruise was brilliant.  I really don't like him much at all, I mean, I was saying this the other day to my wife, but Tom Cruise is annoying in person and he's really not that great of an actor but he always picks the BEST movies...My attitude has changed after seeing this movie.  He may still be annoying, but he can act.  So heres the 411...Max (Foxx)is an LA taxi-cab driver who, as you will see, never reaches hard enough for his dreams.  He's living the same routine he live's everyday, scared of change, scared of anything that may be different.  He picks up a woman (Jada), a lawyer working on a big case and he gives her his philosiphy, that you need to take mini breaks, mini vacations throughout the day and he does this by looking at a postcard of an island.  This is important, because the heart of this movie is so much more than a hitman and a cabbie.  Anyways, he says she needs the break more than he does and he gives her the photo.  In return she gives him her number...so now he keeps that in the spot saved for his photo.  SO out gets the girl and in gets the killer.  Vincent (Cruise) has 5 stops to make and offers Max $700 to take him for the night.  He reluctantly agrees (although it would break routine) and he ends up in for the ride of his life.  There are plot twists and turns, especially come the last thirty minutes or so, and the last ten minutes will have your heart beating through your chest.  Heres what I love so much about this movie, because without the underlining moral of this story it would just be a movie, but it's so much more than that.  Max lives life with no purpose, no excitment because he so afraid of anything different.  Vincent is the exact opposite.  He lives for the moment.  Theres a scene in the movie when Vincent is telling Max that one day he will wake up and realive that his dream never happened.  Case in point, Max's dream is to own his own Limo company 'Island Limos' and he tells everyone that taxi-driving is only temp. that he's saving up for his dream, getting things in order...the reality of it all is he been driving for twelve years...that's Vincent's point...he's had this dream for so long it's almost passed, almost gone and soon it will be too late.  There's a balance between two completly different life-styles or attitudes that needs to be met.  Your life should have some order, but not so much that you rule out the unexpected, you rule out the best parts of life because your not ready for them.  The fact of the mater is Vincent was the best thing that ever happened to Max!</p></body></html>

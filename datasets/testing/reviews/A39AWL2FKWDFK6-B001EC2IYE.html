<meta name="summary" content="Poignant exploration of human relationships"></head><body><p>The gifted Clint Eastwood once again proves his mettle as an outstanding director as evidenced by his spectacular and moving flick "Million Dollar Baby".<br /><br />Eastwood a crusty, curmudgeonly owner of a boxing gym and trainer reluctantly takes an unpolished Hilary Swank under his tutelage.  Swank, utterly fantastic in her portrayal of Maggie Fitzgerald, a dirt poor trailer park denizen of southwestern Missouri is desperate to hone her pugilistic skills.  Eastwood assisted in his gym by the accomplished Morgan Freeman a washed up ex pug who serves as Clint's conscience.  Eastwood is finally cajoled into taking the determined Swank under his wing.  So begins a special relationship between Eastwood and Swank.  Eastwood finds in Swank, the daughter figure he lacks due to his unexplained estrangement from his own daughter.  Swank, close with her now deceased father, but distant from her self centered and dysfunctional hillbilly family looks at Eastwood as a paternal figure.<br /><br />Rising through the ranks and with hard work, Swank is elevated in stature to be deserving of a shot at the woman's world welterweight boxing championship.  At the pinnacle of her fame tragedy strikes.  What follows is an profound and emotional exploration into the psychology of interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />Kudos to Eastwood, Swank and Freeman for superlative acting performances in what could conceivably be the top picture of the year again under Eastwood's capable direction.  Morgan Freeman's soothing baritone narration of the flick was outstanding.  The boxing sequences were brutal and extremely authentic.</p></body></html>

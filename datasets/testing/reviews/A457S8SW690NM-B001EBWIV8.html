<meta name="summary" content="Weird but fantasic movie"></head><body><p>This whole trilogy is very unique and amzing and just absolutely amazing in terms of visuals. Reloaded is my favorite one though and it earned the 4 stars alone because of the action scenes. From the milllllllions of agent Smiths vs. Neo, to the fight against the frenchman's henchmen, to the awesome chase, it's original and just awesome. This movie could have definitely been one of the best movies ever but it feels confused. The plot feels confused with the sometimes bad acting to the weird story with some very random and pointless scenes. The movie also gets very boring and repetitive at times but the action scenes will leave you in such awe and amazement that you'll buy this movie just to rewatch them because stuff like this only occurs in this trilogy.</p></body></html>

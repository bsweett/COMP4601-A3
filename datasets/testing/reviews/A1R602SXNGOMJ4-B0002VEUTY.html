<meta name="summary" content="If it weren't for Vin Diesel....."></head><body><p>This movie is set supposedly five years after Pitch Black.  Now, the wanted criminal Riddick (Diesel) arrives on a planet called New Mecca, and finds himself up against an invading empire called the Necromongers, an army that plans to convert or kill all humans in the universe.<br /><br />All in all, this is a drab, dull effort that basically has only a couple of redeeming features; one of them, of course, is Diesel.  Without Vin Diesel, this would have been a colossal mess. Apart from that, the only other credit are the special effects and the slightly average fight scenes. But apart from that, it's well, downhill. Overall, a silly plot and some watered-down dialogue drag this film down and put a worse name of Pitch Black that was a good sci-fi thriller. The Chronicles of Riddick had potential. None of it shows.</p></body></html>

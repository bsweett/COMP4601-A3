Perhaps this is because I am a bitter [nasty] but everything in it rang true to me. It is the story of 4 people who meet become involved and then tear it all up and cheat and then go thru all the mechinations of covering up, breaking up, being supposedly happy till they find something or someone else and then go thru the whole cycle again. I am not a big Julia Roberts fan but she was good in this. Clive Owen was just excellent as the brutish but likable macho guy. The internet chat/cyber sex scene was hilarious as was the Roberts/Owen break up that just was biting and hardcore down in the dirt dialogue. The whole movie is full of great hardass dialogue that I just thought was hilarious.<br /><br />Also, Natalie Portman as a stripper and in a thong.</p></body></html>

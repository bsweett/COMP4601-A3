<meta name="summary" content="Torture? ...This is nothing."></head><body><p>Fourteen-year-old Hayley has been chatting online with Jeff, a 32-year-old photographer.  They meet at Nighthawk's, have some coffee and cake.  Jeff suggests they go back to his place, so he can take pictures of Hayley for his portfolio.  Hayley agrees, and Jeff is delighted...until he realizes that he's bitten off a bit more than he can chew...<br /><br />"Hard Candy" features some of the finest acting and dialogue ever to appear in a horror movie.  Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are spectacular; you can't take your eyes off them, even in the scenes where you desperately want to look away (and yes, there are a couple).  The humor--there's a surprising amount of it--is appropriately dark; it's the kind of humor where you laugh, then stop once you realize what you're laughing about.  The movie flows along briskly; only two people for most of it, yet you never once get bored.  None of the movie seems extraneous; Sandra Oh's presence isn't at all necessary, yet as director David Slade explains in the extensive making-of featurette, it doesn't matter--everything is made to fit into the movie, so you never really care if it NEEDS to be there or not.<br /><br />I came to "Hard Candy" after reading reviews that praised the hell out of it.  I was skeptical; we all know, a good review doesn't necessarily mean a good movie--I'm sure somebody somewhere called "Coyote Ugly" the best film ever made.  I'm not saying "Hard Candy" is one of the best films ever made, no; but it is certainly one of the best original horror films of the past few years.  In fact, it's such a good horror film that people will deny that it IS a horror film, because the label "horror" has quite a few (unfortunate) negative connotations.  But never fear--"Hard Candy" is an exquisite horror film, and it will terrify you.  And once these fine performances are no longer immediately in front of your eyes, once your disturbed heartbeat has slowed to a more normal pitter-patter, you will have time to think.  And yes, you will think.  Sorry if that prospect frightens you; if so, go elsewhere.  "Hard Candy" is a thinking man's horror movie.  Or, rather, a thinking girl's.  Don't wanna leave the women out--not after watching this.</p></body></html>

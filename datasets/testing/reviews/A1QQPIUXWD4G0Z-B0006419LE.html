<meta name="summary" content="Satirical Sci-Fi At Its Best"></head><body><p>Franklin Shaffner's 1968 adaptation of Pierre Boulle's (author of 'Bridge On The River Kwai')science-fiction satire still makes audiences ponder on questions of human nature even after almost 40 years with its brilliant script and great special effects.<br /><br />The story follows George Taylor (Charleton Heston) and his 3 crew mates who've been travelling the stars at light speed in suspended animation.  The spaceship is programmed to land back on an Earth that is centuries older but something goes terribly wrong: a system failure leads their ship to land in a desolate sea on an unknown planet.  As the crew members salvage what they can from their sinking ship, their hopes of ever returning home go down to the depths along with their ship.  After some exploration, the disoriented astronauts realize that they aren't alone.  On this new planet, apes are the only intelligent life while human hunter-gatherers live like flocks of mute sheep.  Captured by the apes, Taylor speaks out and sends shockwaves through the ape society's scientific community.  Securing the friendship of two chimp scientists named Cornelius (McDowell) and Zera (Hunter), Taylor seeks to save his life and that of his new silent soul-mate Nova (Harrison) against the fanatical Dr. Zeuss (Evans.)  Will he escape this world gone ape?  What will he find if he does?<br /><br />With a brilliant script written by the legendary Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame, the audience is plunged into the depths of this political/social satire.  The film explores the concepts of human nature and its fallacies manifested in social institutions such as religion, science, and government.  The film is an attack on preconceptions as to human nature and its place in the universe. Although the film significantly deviates from Boulle's short story, it is far superior to Tim Burton's recent bubble gum adaptation that offers a true satire as opposed to a mindless and generic sci-fi action plot with no theme.  Also, the make-up and costumes in this version are actually more convicing than the glossy and static CGI enhancements in the new film.<br /><br />This is perhaps one of the rare instances where the film is better than the novel that inspired it.  Boulle's novel is short and leaves the plot somewhat lacking as to it characters just as much as the film lacks more detail as to the ape society Taylor finds himself in.  The film somewhat wins over in this comparative deficiency by developing Taylor's character.  Also, the characters in the film being professional astronauts make more sense than Boulle's eccentric scientist and his crew of amateurs.  Focusing the story on Earth instead of another planet and changing the final scene in the film has a greater thematic impact than the one in Boulle's novel.  An interesting fact that both the novel and film seem to ignore is the disparity in physical strength between humans and apes.  If apes would indeed socially evolve to replace humans then humans would be at a serious disadvantage as apes are much stronger in terms of physical strength and so the scenes where Taylor is wrestling free from the clutches of several gorillas is pretty much an impossibility.  The film making the apes less evolved than in the novel also seems to work better.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great film that, despite its changes, conveys most of the theme in the novel and actually does better than the novel in its plot.  A timeless film to be enjoyed by all ages.</p></body></html>

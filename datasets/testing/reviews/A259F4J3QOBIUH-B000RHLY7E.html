<meta name="summary" content="American Psychos: House of 1000 corpses revisited"></head><body><p>I passed up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009MGEM">House of 1,000 Corpses</a>, many times, when I worked in a movie store, because the cover was freaky and the special packaging was gruesome.  I never rented it.  However, I watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>, and loved the movie.  A coworker explained that this was a "part two" of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009MGEM">House of 1,000 Corpses</a>, so I gave it a chance.<br /><br />I not only enjoyed the movies, but I must admit that thess are now some of my faves.  I also purchased the following items related to this flick; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008JL80">House of 1000 Corpses (Soundtrack, Explicit Lyrics)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009MGEM">House of 1,000 Corpses</a>, and [[ASIN:B0009SCUXIThe Devil's Rejects (DUALDISC, EXPLICIT LYRICS, SOUNDTRACK))].<br /><br />After seeing the Rob Zombie films, the soundtracks have a life of their own.  I've become a big Rob Zombie fan over the past few years, and I recommend his stage performances, as well as ALL of his CDs and DVDs.</p></body></html>

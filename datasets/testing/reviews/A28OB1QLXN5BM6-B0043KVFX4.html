And will they never learn?  Playing with zombies is very dangerous, and could very well mean the end of humanity as we know it.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is the third installment in the RESIDENT EVIL series of zombie flicks.  Picking up approximately 5 years after the end of RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, the deadly virus created by the Umbrella Corporation has escaped containment and turned the world into a barren waste land. Humans, dogs, birds, rats, and all other living creatures have been turned into mindless, flesh-eating zombies.  The remaining humans who have survived the virus are in a constant battle for their lives, banding together in roving caravans.  Our hero Alice wanders the planet on her own, killing zombies wherever and however she can.  In answer to a distress call, she rejoins some old friends, and together they make a break for the last known, virus-free outpost.  But Alice's powers continue to develop and grow, and the Umbrella Corporation wants her back...at any cost.<br /><br />As with RESIDENT EVIL and RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is a monster-killing, gore-filled zombie flick that is unexpectedly entertaining, and is perfect for an evening of mindless relaxation.  I never imaged I could enjoy this series so much.  The pace is fast and bloody, the plot is a bit more substantial than the previous two installments, and the acting is standard for a monster movie...but then again, you don't watch monster movies for the acting.  And the special effects in RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION out do themselves for the title of Best On Screen Decapitation Ever, clearly besting the previous title holder, the original RESIDENT EVIL.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is bit of a departure from the modern day B-movie genre of the first two movies.  There is a little less camp, and lot more "jump out of the dark and go BOO!" in RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION, taking it more toward the horror genre.  Still, my husband and I had a really good time watching this this.  The ending is a perfect set up for the next flick, which promises to launch the most formidable zombie destoying army yet.  Go ask Alice...</p></body></html>

As often as I think I'm not supposed to be liking this film, I can't help it.  The cast is what does makes this a solid and rewatchable vehicle.  It also has the steady feel of a Burton film, with great production values and a great sense of its own ability to frighten and delight all at the same time.</p></body></html>

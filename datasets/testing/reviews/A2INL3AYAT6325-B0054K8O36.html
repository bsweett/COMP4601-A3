<meta name="summary" content="Decent film POOR BLU-RAY & WHERE ARE THE DVD'S"></head><body><p>Well, here I go again with the comments I have been forced to input since fall 2009.<br /><br />What is Disney thinking?  This Release ONLY blu-ray packages BUT we DVD people have to sit & wait for that package?<br /><br />Terrible.  I hope Disney loses a lot of money again because of this idiot choice.<br />I can NOT afford regular DVD's, how can I afford blu-rays?<br /><br />The film is decent.  Jumps around is she or isn't she with Cruz.  At least she can say she has a hit box office movie now.<br /><br />The changing of the Rush's character.  Been in all the films but they keep messing with the character.  And, his character was not even spoken of on the promotional part on the DVD case.<br /><br />It is okay to surprise your audience, but the story jumps EVERY TWO SECONDS get to be a bit much.<br /><br />Johnny can do the Jack character in his sleep.  Bringing Keith Richards back for a cameo.  Only other past character coming back was Gibbs.<br /><br />Now, this LAME, CHEAP BLU-RAY PACKAGE.<br />Yep, I paid an expensive amount of money for a OLD DAYS BUT NOT FOR DISNEY PLAIN SILVER DVD & A COLORFUL FRISBEE.<br /><br />Back when DVD's came out in the late 1990's remember Disney films had colorful discs.  BUT EVERYONE IS DOING BLU-RAY DISNEY.  Does anyone think Walt would have allowed there cheap looking DVD's to be released if he was still alive?  No, I do NOT think so.<br /><br />How about these plastic cases WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN THEM.  CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. So discs can be damaged SO YOU ARE FORCED TO BUY ANOTHER.<br /><br />No chapter list, any information on the film.<br /><br />Film is fine, best of course is still the 2003 original.  But, DISNEY DVD PEOPLE ARE STILL OUT HERE SO RELEASE THEM PROPERLY & STOP THE CUTTING OF CORNERS.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="worst movie of the Summer...THanks Paul W.S. Anderson!!!"></head><body><p>I just wanna let everyone know that they should not waste thier hard earned money on a terrible film like this. I personally hate fox studios for letting Paul W.S. Anderson direct this god-awful movie. I don't know where to begin but i will start with the setting of the movie. Antartica give me a break! Predator only lives in hot climate, i mean common a jungle, Los angelas. The acting was pretty horrible, im just upset they put Lance Henriksen in this movie becuase he was probably the only good actor, and of course he dies off half way through the movie. Anyway besides the corny so-called "emotional scenes", which displays terrible acting by sanna lathan, she becomes friends with the predator!!! Since when does predator become friendly!!! He makes her weapons too, unreal!!! All we needed was a love scene. it pretty much went down hill from there. Another thing which makes me angry is the make up effects, predator looks to human, they make him run with Sanna lathan, they were almost holding hands for godsakes!!! Way tooo much computer graphics. I didn't come into the theaters with high expectations but i mean give me a break this was complete garbage. Another thing, if your gonna make a movie with two sci-fi icons like alien and predator don't make the film pg-13. Big mistake! Alien and predator are sussposed to be extremely violent. My Whole review sums up that i Hate Hollywood and i hate how untalented directors are just remaking movies, and trying to make money by using stupid titles like ALien vs. Predator. I also hate Fox studios for ruining Americas two sweet sci-fi icons. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sigourney Weaver must be very upset. the only reason why i am glad this movie was made is so they could make a special edition dvd out of the original predator. Which i have to admit am grateful because it is about time. Thank god i didn't pay 10 dollars to see this i got a free movie ticket from the dvd. It was still an hour an half waste of my life. I hate FOx!!!</p></body></html>

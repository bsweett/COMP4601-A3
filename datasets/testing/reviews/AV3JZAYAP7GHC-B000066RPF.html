HEEEHEEE HEEEHEEE!<p>(If you've never experiened an unbridled reaction of this kind to absurd comedy, brilliant slapstick, or general silliness, then you will never like this movie. Your life will be devoid of humor ever after and will no longer have any meaning. Move along.)<p>If you have, and delight in the antics of the Pythons, you will not be disappointed. It's a wonderfully restored, remastered, re-whatevered DVD. I loved to hear the actors and directors still genuinely laughing -- after all these years -- on the commentary tracks. This movie stands the test of time as a comedic masterpiece.<p>And the extras are outstanding -- down to the nostalgic documentary with Terry Jones and Michael Palin as they retrace their steps to the Scottish locations where they made film history 30 years ago.</p></body></html>

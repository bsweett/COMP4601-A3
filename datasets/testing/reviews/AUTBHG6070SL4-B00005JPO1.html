<meta name="summary" content="Indy rides again!"></head><body><p>A few years have passed since we last saw him. He's a bit gray around the muzzle, and the bad guys aren't the WWII foes any more, but the Cold War Soviets. It's not clear that all the Americans are good guys either, with the commie witch-hunt in full swing and government investigations looking ever more like mafia shakedowns and intimidation. (Any commentary on current events is wholly in the mind of the reader.)<br /><br />We got past Indy's "cute" phase. There's a kid again, but this one's a 1950s greaser with a shiv, who'll stand against anything as long as his hair looks cool. As with Sean Connery, he's more a colleague in this adventure than sidekick. And there's the babe too. This time it's Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen - again. Indy's aged since the first movie in this franchise and so has Marion. She's a strong and handsome figure again, in more than one sense. Seeing the two actors genuinely age, as well as skipping forward in story time, adds a charm to the pair that really can't be synthesized. The reunion makes for some nice points in the plot, which I leave you to see for yourself. Oh, and Indy's hat gets a few really good scenes.<br /><br />Summer movies like this tend to be commodity entertainment, but this is a very fine commodity. The heroes stand tall, bad guys (including Cate Blanchett as the baddest of the bad) fit all the stereotypes they need to, chase scenes thrill and amuse, and the effects become increasingly grand as the story reaches its crescendo. There's lots of ineffectual gunplay and some really bad science, but the violence takes on a comic edge just before it would have turned realistically bloody. The plot wears thin enough that I had trouble avoiding spoilers, but hey - that's not why you're watching this movie. You signed up for a roller coaster ride, and you get one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

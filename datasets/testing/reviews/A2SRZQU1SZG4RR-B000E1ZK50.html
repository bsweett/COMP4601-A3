<meta name="summary" content="Dracula, Frankenstein, Hero/Heroine & Matrix-like Action"></head><body><p>This is a highly entertaining film with loads of technical expertise similar to the Matrix films. The computer graphic artistry is expert. It is a modern version of classic films with themes including Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolves, Brides of Dracula, *plus*, a swashbuckling adventurer, named Van Helsing, who on certain levels, resembles a darker, cutting-edge, mysterious "Indiana Jones", added to this is, a 'secret' religious group within the Catholic church that is 'fighting the worst kind of evil' resembling an off-spring of the "Da Vinci Code". Overall, the film was a huge hit with this viewer and the audience who sat in the same theater ... <p>It is non-stop action and in this sense, resembles the Matrix ... The film begins with scenes of magnificent snow-capped mountains, quaint villages with spired onion-domed steepled churches, hordes of peasants in revolt, trying to break into the castle while crossing the moat ... Dr. Hyde (Victor) has created a 'monster', Frankenstein ... Victor is killed and Dracula seeks to steal the machine which produces 'life' ...so that his 'off-spring' with his brides may be brought to life. for 400 years Dracula has been forced to drink the blood of the local peasants, but to his credit ... he never takes more than he needs (such a nice guy and handsome, too). Velkion and Anna, the son and daughter of Count Valerius of Transylvania are trying to fight Dracula and his vampire entourge (who just happen to be mostly -- no, in fact, *all* are females). Velkion, the handsome young count becomes a 'werewolf' during one of the fights against the evil forces which haunt this village. Van Helsing receives orders from a secret Catholic organization, he is to go to Transylvania to overthrow the powers of evil which are growing there and may overtake Europe. He receives James Bond-like modern weapons created by Karl, a friar, who is a modest-looking scientific expert. He becomes Van Helsing's side-kick in this adventure. Furthermore, he brings along a parchment, with an undecipherable Latin phrase that later fits into the mural on the wall. It becomes the 'missing piece' providing the "secet" to the entrance to Dracula's castle. The battle between "good and evil" ensues ... again, the resemblence to the Matrix is very evident but with lots of differences. The transformations of human into monster and back to human are quite creative and realistic, computer artistry at its best. <p>The casting and acting for the most part are superb. Richard Roxburgh plays Dracula with finesse. He looks authentically like a Transylvanian, complete with believable Eastern European accent. His clothes and manners are impeccable. His upper class haughtiness is perfect. Van Helsing is a great action hero,a true fighter for the cause. Hoswever, he is a let-down in the area of romance. The scenes with him and Anna (Kate Beckinsdale) do not *sizzle* ... unfortunately, our hero is much more interested in his *job* than *this* temptation, a tangential romantic relationship ... too bad ... that is the only reason I gave it *FOUR* and not *FIVE* stars. Of course, Van Helsing is not to blame, it is the writer. Nonetheless, even with this one flaw, I highly recommend this film. Great fun and entertainment.<br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)</p></body></html>

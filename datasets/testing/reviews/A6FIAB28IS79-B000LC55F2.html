<meta name="summary" content="Seeing Double While Confusing Suspense with Sensation, Prestige with Pretense"></head><body><p>This film is as disappointing as "The Illusionist" is satisfying, surprising, and representative of imaginative movie-making at its best.  By contrast, "The Prestige" tries to acquire some literary cachet from Edgar Allen Poe and Joseph Conrad doppelganger stories while willfully disregarding the logic of physical reality and blatantly and continuously manipulating the spectator.  Made-for-TV jump-cutting clashes with the agonizing drawn-out final scene in what is a very confusing and confused mish-mash of a film--a betrayal of the unwritten rules that a master like Hitchock would never think of violating.<br /><br />The movie lectures us about the 3-part drama that comprises a master magician's illusion--the set-up, the act (making something disappear), the trick (or "Prestige"), which is the restoration of the disappearing body.  But the movie ignores the spectator's underlying requirement--viz. the trick must amaze because it occurs in spite of the material limits, or laws of finite existence, with which we are all too familiar.  When the trick passes this "reality test," the result is an amazed and delighted spectator who asks "how" did they do that?  But in the case of "The Prestige," which resorts to the "deus ex machina" principle, or to sheer fantastic "sci-fi" and "weird science" devices, the spectator is left asking, merely, "why" did they do that?  (We'll pass by the smaller questions--i.e. where are we?  what did he just say?--that this pretentious and botched patchwork of a film is bound to provoke. The movie's frantic editing and "Method"-like acting do little more than expose glaring deficiencies in both areas.)<br /><br />For those who can be content to play with the doppelganger and sacrifice themes (the disappearance requires that someone or something--a bird, for instance--gets snuffed), perhaps there's something to be taken away from the film other than a bad after-taste and greater respect for superior films like "The Illusionist" and Alfred Hitchcock's masterworks.  As Michael Caine says, "We want to be tricked, which requires believing in the illusion."  In this film we believe in everything up to the point of the illusion itself, at which point our suspension of disbelief is no longer possible.  You'd have to be the biggest fan of Roger Corman or, perhaps, Ed Wood to believe in this film's ill-conceived and clumsy manipulations.  It's an Illusion that, however temporarily "amazing," fails with a resounding thud, the director mistaking sensation for suspense and pretense for prestige.<br /><br />[For a point-by-point counter-argument to my position (I won't elevate the above response to an "argument"), see the first commentary (below) by OBrien, who works out the "logic" of the trick with persuasive if not compelling points--sufficient to suggest that "The Prestige" not merely rivals the sophistication of "The Illusionist" but exceeds it!  All the same, I dislike "The Prestige" (that is, I think I do--it's hard sometimes to know what one likes; one often likes what one comes to know).  I'll add another layer to Obrien's case (though it's his references to the journals that bring it to mind): the film's unusual (and clever) use of multiple narrators, thereby "privileging" different viewpoints of elusive "truth" at any given moment, along with written words, or the power of language.  Journals (words) enable any of us to defy the laws of physical reality (we constantly confront the presence of absence with language, restoring to the present the "thing" that is otherwise no longer physically present to us).<br /><br />So the film may be both ingenious and deeply philosophical (thereby refuting my position that it resorts to common deus ex machina, sci-fi, sensational devices).  But consider, again, the difference (aside from camera work, acting, sets, form) between the two similar films.  In "The Illusionist" two childhood friends/lovers are separated and the protagonist-magician ultimately realizes his "obsession" of bringing her back from the void.  He tells her he loves her and will bring her back into his life--and he pulls off this seemingly impossible "trick" (the viewer may, if he/she wishes, attribute all to the power of love, though everything is logically explained.  "The Prestige" is a beast of a different order.  The magician Borden tells his wife that he loves her and she answers: "Sometimes you say that and don't mean it, which is all right because it makes sweeter the times when you actually do mean it."  "Prestige" is a word that has little to do with love and everything to do with power and, more importantly, "pride" (or that deadly nemesis "hubris").  "The Prestige," in other words, is driven by the obsessive pride of two competing magicians who will go to all lengths to make the rival disappear, thereby realizing the not-so-magnificent obsession of either one.  I suspect I'm not alone in my preferred obsession: I'll reserve my 5-star rating for the magician who will put everything on the line to make his beloved reappear.]</p></body></html>

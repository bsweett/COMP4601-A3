<meta name="summary" content="Best performance of Gibson's career!"></head><body><p>I'm not a &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; fan and I normally don't coo and carry on about Mel Gibson, but his performance in this film blew me away.<p>When Gibson got the Oscar for best director and the movie got the Oscar for best  picture, I was thinking, &quot;what?&quot; I hadn't seen the film yet and I  thought it was just some grandiose tale w/ Gibson showing off his long hair  and rippling muscles or something. It just looked stupid to me and I wasn't  interested in seeing the film from the trailers.<p>After everyone made such  a big deal over the film, I figured I'd rent it and see what the commotion  was about.  It is a beautiful film and I wish I had seen it on the big  screen.  Gibson's performance is stellar. You easily get emotionally  involved with the characters in this film, which really helps you to forget  that this is indeed a movie you're watching and not an experience you're  having.<p>The film is based on William Wallace, one of Scottland's greatest  heros. While Wallace was a real character, I've heard commentary that this  film deviates from history on almost every account of this man.  Wallace  was almost all but forgotten until this movie came out, however, and even  historians were applauding the film for bringing more interest in William  Wallace.<p>The battle scenes are exciting and the emotional struggles in  the film ranging from first love to seeing friends and love ones being  executed runs high through out.  Even the ending, while tragic, is poignant  and beautiful... the Oscars won for this film were honorably earned.</p></body></html>

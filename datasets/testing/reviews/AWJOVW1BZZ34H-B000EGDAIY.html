<meta name="summary" content="It's okay."></head><body><p>An American nurse living in Tokyo Japan goes into a house that is haunted because a man killed his wife in it when he found out she was in love with another dude. Now, she is being stalked by this evil spirit (they never really tell you who's spirit it is) as is everyone that enters the house.<br /><br />The story is mediocre, but there are some really creepy scenes. Worth seeing.</p></body></html>

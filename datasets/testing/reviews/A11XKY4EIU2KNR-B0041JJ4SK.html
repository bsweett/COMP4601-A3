How about a half-Chinese and a Mexican who did this same kind of comedy 30 years ago? LIke most of the stuff that Hollywood cranks out these days, nothing is original.<br /><br />So OK we have two dudes smoking weed on a Friday night and they get the munchies. They decide to go to White Castle and finally arrive Saturday morning. Deep plot huh?<br /><br />I think any movie that has Patrick Neil Harris playing himself is in trouble from the get go. To see him snort a line of coke off a girl's bare behind while standing in a speeding car is just disturbing. You've certainly come a long way Doctor Doogie.<br /><br />Our heros also get a ride in a tow truck from the Christian man of 1000 boils, together they ride a cheetah bareback, try to score weed at Princeton University, and learn about the special sauce at a competing burger joint.<br /><br />The gags are OK and it is good for a few laughs here and there, but I don't think these two are going to be the next dynamic duo of the weed comedy genre. They were pretty forgetable. They just didn't seem to have much personality, espescially the Asian guy.<br /><br />If you got nothing to do, go ahead and watch it sometime. I doubt it'll become your favorite comedy, but it's a good 90 minutes spent if you're watching it for the first time.</p></body></html>

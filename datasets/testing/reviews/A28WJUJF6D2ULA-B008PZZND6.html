The first thing I liked was the beauty of the natural setting at the start of the movie when the couple at the heart of this story, Jack and Ennis, were atop Brokeback Mountain itself. The other was during the fireworks scene when Heath Ledger's character punched out the rude biker type who was cussing and being crude around his little girls. The rest of the film...well...<br /><br />I realize this is one of those stories where if you don't like it, you're instantly and with a closed-mind convicted of being a homophobe (such a convenient passive-aggressive term!) or unenlightened, or the ever-pat, "you just didn't get it."  I disagree. I'd like to think I'm at least as enlightened as the next person out there and if I'm accused to failing to "get" Brokeback Mountain, then I'll turn the tables and say maybe a large portion of the audience was too ready to excuse too much here and proclaim its greatness for reasons other than its onscreen merits. Namely: "Hey, look at how cool I am, embracing this movie about homosexuality!"<br /><br />I suspect many hailed Brokeback Mountain as masterpiece because they felt its subject matter was somehow artsy, ground-breaking, and morally sophisticated. I'll leave those evaluations to others. All I know is I saw it from a neutral perspective and I did not like this film. I expected I'd at least come away seeing some sort of quality to it, but even that is largely lacking. Michelle Williams, who gave seven seasons worth of fine performances on Dawson's Creek was such a washed-out weakling here, it was almost unrecognizable that she possesses the acting talents she does. I realize both the lead actors are in reality heterosexual men, but even so, for supposedly portraying two souls deeply in love, I discerned no chemistry at all between them, only a coldness that made it clear they were just two actors playing parts: disbelief was not suspended, reality intruded into the plot. If anything, a good subtitle for these guys might've been "dumb and dumber". Kissing like they did in public, in plain sight of one of their wives, in town, and their boss up on Brokeback Mountain? And yet thinking they were keeping some sort of secret for twenty-whatever years? Am I alone in seeing that as...stupid?<br /><br />What really put me off was not the relationship between the men, adulterous though it was, it was the fact these supposedly sympathetic figures were complete and total jerks. Obviously they were miserable and wished to impose that misery on anyone close to them. They were terrible fathers, especially Ennis, who constantly and cruelly let his longsuffering daughter down, rotten (and unfaithful) husbands, and not even very good friends and lovers to one another. How anyone felt anything but alienation radiating from these two defies explanation. If this is the movie that was meant to be a groundbreaking ambassador for the gay community, I think gays are in trouble, because far from advancing the cause of that segment, surely this is a closet-embracing backset.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE WINDS OF WAR..."></head><body><p>Mel Gibson plays the role of an early American colonist, Benjamin Martin. He is a reluctant hero, a man who does not take sides in the Revolutionary War until forced to do so. When one of his young sons is killed during a gratuitous display of brutality by a British officer, and another is taken away to be hanged, Martin is at a crossroad in his life. This galvanizes Martin, our reluctant hero, into action, and he rescues his otherwise doomed son with a ferocity of purpose that is gripping.<br /><br />Once committed, Martin becomes a leader of the local militia and the scourge of the British. There is a droll scene in which he and Cornwallis, the leader of the British campaign, meet, and Martin manages to get the better of him. It is here, however, that the British officer who killed Martin's son locks horns with Martin, and the lines are drawn. This sets the tenor for what is to come.<br /><br />There are scenes of great barbarity and pathos, which tell one that war is not just about heroism and great battles, but about personal pain and loss. It is about a desire for freedom and the privilege of living in peace without the yoke of tyranny around one's neck. Despite the odds, Martin cuts a wide swath of destruction among the British, and his prowess and leadership on the battlefield ultimately lead to a turning point in the American Revolution.<br /><br />This movie shows the effect that the war had on civilians and how their lives were affected by it. The film is about love, family, honor, dishonor, tragedy, and redemption. Deftly directed by Roland Emmerich, this is a well-acted film with stirring action scenes. Mel Gibson is perfectly cast as a colonist whose life is turned upside down by the vagaries of war. The supporting cast is, likewise, excellent. This is simply a film that should not be missed.</p></body></html>

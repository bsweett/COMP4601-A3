<meta name="summary" content="Once again!!! Hollywood forgets to be consistent!!!"></head><body><p>This is the fourth movie based on the character of Jack Ryan,& Tom Clancy's popular book series, 1990's "Hunt for Red October" featured Alec Baldwin in the role, which was o.k., when he dropped out of the follow-ups, Harrison Ford took over, although 1992's "Patriot Games" brought out the best in Ford as Jack Ryan, 1994's "Clear & Present Danger" continued in consistentsy & was in all fairness a good follow-up to "Games", you could actually forgive them for Baldwin in "Red October", but now we have "The Sum of All Fears" which tells a good story & for the most part stays with the tension seen in the other films, since Ford decided not to do this one, the filmakers decided to go back in time so to speak & show Ryan as a rookie rather than a veteran as in the case of Ford, which is fine, Ben Affleck is very believeable as a younger version of Ford, not only in character but in appearance, & his girlfriend totally nails the character that Anne Archer created in Ford's films, who will later become his wife, even Morgan Freeman echoes the character played by James Earl Jones in the others as does Liev Scheiber as Clark played the same way by Willem DaFoe in "Clear & Present Danger", what ruins this one is the lack of consistentsy in events, it is as if the filmakers here have never seen the others, for starters, Ryan & Clark never meet until "Danger" but here they are sneaking around together, Freeman's character is that of Jones' character even though their name is different(another flaw) not to mention the fact that Freeman suffers a terrible fate which would make Jones non-existent in the others(another dumb move), Affeck totally embodies Ryan just as Ford did, & I have no problem with their prequel approach, but why not be consistent????, the only redemming thing this one has is the tense standoff between the U.S & Russia who become pawns in a deadly game of deceit by Ex-Nazis who want to see both countries kill each other in their quest for domination, which in a sense echoes the cold war, which plays in some ways on consistentsy with the other films whose time frame is consistent, where "Red October" more or less shows the end, & "Games" & "Danger" dealing with other matters of national security, if only Freeman who is very good here would have been on par with Jones' character & Ryan & Clark not meeting here, then consistentsy would have prevailed in this one, but standard Hollywood never thinks about the importance of consistentsy in follow-ups for whatever reasons probably being that they are more concerned about box-office, which in some ways insults the viewer who is a fan, the fact that this one didn't measure up in terms of box-office like its predecessors only re-inforces this fact, a good movie if you don't care about the others, but disappointing if you are looking for consistentsy!!!</p></body></html>

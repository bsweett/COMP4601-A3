Rarely do we get to watch a war story from the opposite side. It was quite a refreshing and eye opening experience, especially since it didn't dehumanize a single character. I say this in spite of the fact that many gruesome death and destruction scenes are featured, each side fighting for what they believe to be right. This film depicts war from the "enemy's" point of view; it's an experience I recommend to everyone, especially to those who have only seen one-sided commentaries.<br /><br />As the title suggests, characters frequently write letters to loved ones back on the Japanese mainland. Mostly taking place in 1944, we hear the thoughts and feelings of two soldiers--General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya)--as they write, bringing to the story an emotional depth that's incredibly compelling. Saigo writes to his wife, Hanako (Nae Yuuki), who was pregnant when he was called to duty by the Japanese government. He understandably wants to return home, not only to reunite with his wife, but also to meet his baby daughter for the first time. Such things are repeatedly said in his letters, as are general complaints about their hardships and their grueling daily activities.<br /><br />While stationed on the island of Iwo Jima, the soldiers prepare for America's inevitable attack. They must do a multitude of tasks: digging trenches, hollowing out caves, arming weapons, etc. But what makes their situation even more difficult is the fairly low morale among the soldiers; despite their service to their country, despite believing that they will die honorably, many seem to know that they're fighting a losing battle; most of their forces have been destroyed, and they're clearly not ready to do battle on the island. It doesn't help that the soldiers are being served tainted water, causing widespread dysentery. After weeks of such conditions, many are willing to surrender the island to American forces. Saigo makes the mistake of suggesting this out loud as their hotheaded captain, Tanida (Takumi Bando), passes by. Apparently, saying such things is unpatriotic and disgraceful; he certainly makes this clear as he beats Saigo with a whip.<br /><br />Then enters Kuribayashi, a levelheaded man of surprising emotional strength (as shown during scenes of letter writing to his unseen daughter). He notices Tanida's outburst and immediately points out that a good captain uses his brain, not just his whip. Already, this puts him at odds with other military officers, who begin to feel that he's better off behind a desk than commanding an army. They also grow increasingly suspicious of his proposed strategies; he believes that digging a trench along the beach is a waste of time, and that the soldiers should focus their attention on caves underneath the mountains. As the film progresses, feelings against the general rise, especially when they learn that he had spent some time in America.<br /><br />Indeed, his feelings for the Americans are not as clear-cut as most of the other soldiers'. They were raised to believe that Americans were a weak, inferior people, easily succumbing to emotional impulses when out on the battlefield. By the time combat begins on the island, many Japanese soldiers realize that what they were taught to believe was wrong. There's an especially powerful scene in which the Japanese takes in a wounded American soldier. The superior officer orders that he be treated, not killed. His reasoning is simple: any one of his soldiers would do the same for him. "An American would never treat a Japanese soldier!" protests a young officer. "Have you ever met one?" is the commander's reply, which was a profound thing to say. The complex relationship between the opposing armies grows deeper after the wounded soldier awakens; he and a Japanese soldier engage in a very cordial conversation.<br /><br />If only the world's problems could be fixed that easily. Unfortunately, a war is raging, and not everyone is ready to put all differences aside. The Japanese know this all too well: their ammunition is rapidly dwindling, as is their food and water supply; reinforcements will not be sent; soldiers are dying left and right. Some soldiers resort to suicide, believing that they should die honorably as opposed to fighting a losing battle. A very graphic yet important scene shows a number of soldiers with hand grenades, activating them while holding them tightly to their chests. One can't help but question the mentality of anyone willing to die so needlessly, especially since they had the chance (albeit an incredibly slim one) of surviving the war and returning home.<br /><br />At a certain point in the film, Saigo buries a sack full of unsent letters, none of which would be found until 2005, when a research team discovers them. A shot of the letters falling from the open sack is extremely poignant, with the voices of the soldiers overlapping one another. That scene in particular shows the greatest amount of humanity, and I thank the filmmakers for including it. Much like "Flags of Our Fathers," "Letters from Iwo Jima" is not a film that glorifies war in any way; rather, it gives a face to the violence and bloodshed that was World War II, a face that we have rarely been given the chance to see. It was both brave and necessary for a war film to show America's "enemies" as human beings, with hopes, fears, and loves. For that reason alone, this film needs to be seen.</p></body></html>

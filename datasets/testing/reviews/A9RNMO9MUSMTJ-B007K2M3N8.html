<meta name="summary" content="Days of the big bands and musical talented artist..."></head><body><p>Love big band music...jazz stuff from the old days and talented people. I know the<br />music...but dont know too many artists. So after hearing the Name Bobby Darrin all<br />my life, i finally found this movie directed and played by Kevin Spacey.<br />  What a great choice...Kevin told us the story of Bobby by playing him, dancing,<br />singing and giving us a look on what made Bobby Darrin.  By the end of the film,<br />i was totally energized with music and was extremly happy to have seen the film, and<br />learn more on this incredible artist that was suppose to die at a very young age but<br />survived on the love of music for more than 3 decades.<br />  Looking at the reviews, looks like some people cant get into this kind of musical<br />film, and when you read a remark stating...oh my gosh..Kevin Spacey is too old to<br />play and dance in this film, you must know now that some people will never get to<br />see and feel the magic of creativiy and music.<br />  Great film, thank you very much Kevin Spacey for doing this. This is the first<br />film of Kevin Spacey that i really really enjoyed.<br />And i hope more films are made about our unsung musical talented heroes from the<br />past...</p></body></html>

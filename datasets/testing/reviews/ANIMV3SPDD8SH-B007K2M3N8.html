<meta name="summary" content="THE BOBBY DARIN SHOW"></head><body><p>This film starts off on the wrong foot and gets worse as it dances along. Amazingly ill-conceived drama gives us the free-wheeling, care-free public image of Bobby Darin in enormity, but offers little insight into the man behind the celebrity, as if Darin's press agent was still working for a dead man.  Almost immediately, "Beyond The Sea" ventures into a surreal world, a lot like Roy Scheider talking to his dead Mom in "All That Jazz", and retains that effect, remaining cold and detatched from the subject at hand as a result. The script is almost dismally bad, cutting through glossy Hollywood bio cliches (Mom dies), and weak uninvolving situations, (married to 'Gidget' Sandra Dee with much less adventurous romance than found in a Gidget movie), just so Kevin Spacey as Darin, can sing and dance, neither of which, it seems to me, he does very well, the singing particularly, like your average guy deluded into believing in his vocal prowess due to the echo in the shower stall.<br /><br />Time lines zip by; the Vietnam War, death of Robert Kenndy Jr., a change in popular music's taste, as if rushing us to a big conclusion while John Goodman, as Darin's manager keeps popping his head in doorways, serving as some kind of time signature; "Bobby, you're playing the Copa.", "Bobby, you're nominated for an Oscar.", "Bobby, your toupee needs straightening." It seems Mr. Spacey who also wrote, directed and produced "Beyond The Sea', would be content to scrap the entire bio, and instead put on a Bobby Darin impersonation night club routine. He could sing and dance to his heart's desire, but eventually somebody (young) would come along and do it better. He could then recite the movie's thematic quote, repeated in the film, - "Memories are like moon beams. It's up to you what to do with them." Not very heavy. Right up there with, "loving Bobby Darin means never having to say you're sorry."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Much better than the original!"></head><body><p>In response to the bad reviews:<br /><br />"People, please get a clue.  Go and rent the original 1976 version and watch it.  It is not as good as we thought it was when it first appeared on the big screen."<br /><br />In this new version, Liev Schreiber is near perfect as a Robert Thorn, a man who finds himself climbing the ladder of success faster than even he can comprehend.  He may have underplayed his part a slight bit, but his role still works.<br /><br />Julia Stiles turns in a fantastic performance as Katherine Thorn, a woman torn between unconditional love for her child and hating the little devil!<br /><br />This newer version of the first Omen is better because it uses shock you out of your seat scenes to make it seem like a horror-coaster!  People really need to get over the whole "they just can't remake films as good as the original" mentality.  This film passes the original in every way.<br /><br />Gregory Peck was like a robot on screen in the original movie.  Now I'm not saying Schreiber was as animated as a Muppet on steroids, but I believe he showed a bit more pizzazz as things began to spin more out of control in the Thorn household.<br /><br />The music, special effects, timing of scary scenes and general filming are better in this 2006 version.  But both films rely on scary music and some gory death scenes to make this film a success.<br /><br />Ignore the critics.  They're way to "old school!"<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></body></html>

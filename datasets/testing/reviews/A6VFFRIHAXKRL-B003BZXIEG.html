<meta name="summary" content="Not as bad as everyone says but not great either 7/10 part 2 on X3 digital copy reviews"></head><body><p>I understand why people dislike this movie but I think the intention was to entertain people I thought that X Men The Last Stand was a good movie just not as good as the last 2 movies. The cast is returns they introduce Beast played by none other than Kelsey Grammer & another guy was Juggernaut played by Vinne Jones could Vinne Jones not be in any movies there are so many d**n characters here it's hard to remember who play who. Plot is Scott or Cyclops is still emo over Jean Grey's death he gets a telepathic & is going to see her well he's killed by her Jean is later found by our heroes & taken to the Mansion but she escapes goes to her old house. Professor X tracks her there & runs into Magneto (SARCASIM) wasn't expecting that. Jean is The Phenoix she kills the Professor. There's a sub plot a cure has been found for mutants to make them normal this is why Magneto needs Jean Grey to start a war & kill this kid cause he has the ability to produce this cure. Wolverine realises what he must do to stop Phenoix.</p></body></html>

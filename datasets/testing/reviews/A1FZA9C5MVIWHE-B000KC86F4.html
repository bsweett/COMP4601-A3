<meta name="summary" content="this movie rules"></head><body><p>X-Men 3 is very cool. this movie is bursting with non-stop action. although it is inaccurate from the cartoon's content, I still enjoyed it. I thought Kelsey Grammer was the perfect person to play Hank "Beast" McCoy as he is just as intelligent. they ought to have more characters from the cartoon series, such as Sabretooth and Toad, on a possible 4th movie. the movie had a bit of nudity in it, and that was when Mystique was hit with a "cure" dart and turned into a normal woman, but there was no frontal nudity involved.</p></body></html>

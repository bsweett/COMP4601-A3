<meta name="summary" content="Excruciatingly haunting (I mean that in a good way)..."></head><body><p>Once `The Sixth Sense' opened to major critical acclaim back in 1999 it seemed that there was a sudden rush of `ghost films' making their way to your local theater.  Some of them failed miserably to capitalize on what made `The Sixth Sense' so remarkable and groundbreaking.  And then there were a select few that just got it right.<br /><br />`The Others' is one of those few.<br /><br />Now, working off of my last review for `Planet of the Apes' where I showed a negative example of `suffering' through the same film twice in a row; I actually saw `The Others' in the theater twice in the same day as well.  Yes, I had a lot of time to kill back in 2001 (apparently).  I also worked in the mall, so when I got off work I moseyed over to the theater (right around the corner from the store I worked in) and picked a flick to watch.  After watching `The Others' I was moved to call my friends and recommend they see it.  I was lucky enough to accompany them.<br /><br />This movie still gives me shivers today.<br /><br />I think what makes `The Others' so compelling is the way it uses the genre clich&eacute;s to its benefit.  There is a lot going on here that is `standard' so-to-speak when you consider the genre, but this film manages to make it all work for it in a way that appears fresh and new to us.  The scares may be familiar (loud stomping in the dark) but this film pulls it off flawlessly.  The mood is beautifully set, with sets that are genuinely creepy without ever `trying to hard' to accomplish something.  The direction is sharp and the attention to detail is stellar here, actually building tension with every slipping frame.<br /><br />And then there is the acting.<br /><br />A lot of my friends consider Nicole Kidman's performance in `The Others' to actually be better than her Oscar nominated performance in `Moulin Rouge!'  It's hard for me to judge really, since they are so different, but truth be told that 2001 was a great year for Nicole.  She brilliantly captures the whole essence of this character, flawlessly exhibiting the right amount of chilled desolation needed to bring us into her shoes.  I also really enjoyed the young actors here, Alakina Mann and James Bentley.  They really understood the layers their characters needed to appear relatable and engaging.<br /><br />And Fionnula Flanagan is just brilliantly creepy.<br /><br />One thing I really LOVED about this film was the surprise ending that I NEVER SAW COMING.  There is a lot to be said about a twist ending that catches the viewer off guard without ever appearing to be forced or manipulated or preposterous.  This twist may even be better and more shocking than the one presented in `The Sixth Sense'!<br /><br />Just watch this movie; and then watch it again.</p></body></html>

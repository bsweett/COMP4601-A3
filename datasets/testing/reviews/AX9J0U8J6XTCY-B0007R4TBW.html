WERE ALL INTRIGUING, MESMERIZING, AND TOTALLY WONDERFUL! A SHEER DELIGHT THAT HAD ME SMILING ALL THE WAY THRU. IT'S AN INDIE NOT  TO BE MISSED BY ANY LOVER OF ORIGINAL CINEMA, AND THE NEW DVD IS SUPERB AS WELL. GREAT SCORE, DIGITAL EFFECTS, AWESOME SOUND, ETC. THIS ONE'S A REAL KEEPER-TREAT YOURSELF TO 'GARDEN STATE" YOU WILL BE SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU DID.</p></body></html>

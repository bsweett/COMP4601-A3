<meta name="summary" content=""Nothin' But Blue Pills"  ~  Man And Machine Collide"></head><body><p>`The Matrix Revolutions' released in the Fall of '03 is the third and last film of the highly successful Matrix trilogy. In this final installment of the "Neo Mythos" the war in Zion between man and machine is underway. As the resistance makes a last gallant stand against the mechanized onslaught, Neo attempts a perilous journey to the City of Machines in an effort to stop the violence once and for all.<br /><br />While the special effects continued to soar to higher and more complex levels of accomplishment, the dialogue clearly shows signs of weakness, lacking the terse, polished syntax of the first two films. However having said that it is still a worthy conclusion to the Neo saga.<br /><br />Thanks Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Agent Smith and the Wachowski brothers. It's been a fantastic adventure!</p></body></html>

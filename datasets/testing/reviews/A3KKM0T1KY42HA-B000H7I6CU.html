It succeeds in warming the heart; it makes you appreciate the value of friends and family; and it continues the tradition of teaching good morals. It's a class-A family film.<br /><br />The picture is just awesome; this computer generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D. Unbelievable.<br /><br />There has been a tremendous proliferation of computer generated films over the past couple of years which has certainly diluted the excitement that used to surround these movies. 2006 has got to set the record with 13...count 'em...13 releases that I can think of (Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Barnyard, Over the Hedge, Hoodwinked, The Ant Bully, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away).<br /><br />And perhaps that is why I was a bit tentative going into Cars. Or perhaps it was because I just didn't think a movie about car racing and cars-come-to-life could be as enjoyable as the Disney Pixar films that preceded Cars. I should have known better.<br /><br />Cars is another in Disney Pixar's unblemished track record of delivering the epitome of a wonderful family classic.<br /><br />Here's a little trivia: John Ratzenburger appears (rather, his voice does) in all (Toy Story [1995], A Bug's Life [1998], Toy Story 2 [1999], Monsters, Inc [2001], Finding Nemo [2003], The Incredibles [2004] & Cars [2006]) of the Disney Pixar releases to date, and there's a little tribute to this at the end of Cars during the rolling credits.<br /><br />Cars is a very good movie that's well worth the purchase.</p></body></html>

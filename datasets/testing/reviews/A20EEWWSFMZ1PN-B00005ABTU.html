<meta name="summary" content="Good screen adaptation of a Stephen King story"></head><body><p>Be careful whom you pick on especially after puberty.<br /><br />Carrie White(Sissy Spacek) comes from a very oppressive environment. Her mother Margaret White (Piper Laurie) is a zealot and does not stand for any nasty doings. Carrie is not the most popular girl in school. Let's face it she is the butt of many practical jokes.<br /><br />The time comes when puberty hit her hard. And Stephen King says that is the time when any latent supernatural tendencies creep out. Sure enough Carrie finds that she can telekinesis. She even gets help from her PE teacher.<br /><br />Are things going to work out better for Carrie?<br />Where did she get such a gift?<br />Do you suppose she will be invited to the Prom by Tommy (William Katt)?<br /><br />What ever you do, do not make a grave mistake.<br /><br />This is a well crafted story with fine actors. This theme will play out again and again in future horror movies where the person getting picked on gets their revenge at a price.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000J2KX">The Shining ~ Jack Nicholson</a></p></body></html>

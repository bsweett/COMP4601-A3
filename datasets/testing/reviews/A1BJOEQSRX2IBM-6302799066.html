<meta name="summary" content="The Greatest Black Comedy Ever Made!"></head><body><p>One of the funniest movies ever made. Although the subject matter is nothing to laugh about, it manages to get a laugh in every scene. Peter Sellers gives one of the best comedy performances of the century playing 3  different roles (Kubrick and Sellers had originally planned for him to play  4 roles). George C. Scott is extremely funny as the eccentric general,  Sterling Hayden is also great as the general who is obsessed with bodily  fluids. Great craftsmanship courtesy of Kubrick. One of the all-time  greats, extremely entertaining and grows funnier with each viewing. Extras:  spot James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader). From a scale of 1-10 I  give this film a 10!</p></body></html>

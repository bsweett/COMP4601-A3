<meta name="summary" content="HIGH TENSION FIZZLES OUT"></head><body><p>For most of its running time, HIGH TENSION is a mindless, albeit suspenseful, retread of many slasher movies of the past.  Fueled by the presence of Cecile DeFrance in the leading role, the movie manages to keep us enthralled with the plight of a young girl who is trying to escape the murderer who has brutally slayed the family of her best friend.  What undoes the movie however is its ludicrous plot twist that is so outrageous, it can't be believed for a minute.  While to be applauded for an attempt to put a new twist on the tired genre, HIGH TENSION falls apart with its contrived and unbelievable ending.  Too bad, it was doing great up until then.</p></body></html>

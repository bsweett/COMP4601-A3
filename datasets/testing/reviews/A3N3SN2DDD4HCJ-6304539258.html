Watching it again is like revisiting the time when movies were supposed to be fun, adventurous and great  looking. It still stands as probably the best and most popular science  fiction film, it makes &quot;Star Trek&quot; seem like something for boring  people. &quot;Star Wars&quot; is a unique blend of action, romance,  mythology, style, technology, and just plain good old storytelling. The  characters are plain, but who cares? They live in a universe so complex  that their own complexity is something we could care less about. What's  great here is the blend of special effects and the story. Lucas fills the  screen with great visuales while still telling an exhilarating tale of good  against evil, a princess in distress, a wise old master of the Force, his  young pupil who will reach a greater peak, a space pirate and his hairy  comrade and they only care about the bounty, and a dark lord who wishes to  stop them. &quot;Star Wars&quot; never fails to entertain, looks great and  feels great from the first shot to the last. Lucas's script is pure  brilliance and imagination. Watching &quot;The Phantom Menace,&quot; you  realize &quot;Star Wars&quot; is still better. Lucas has created great  modern mythology, and an incredible blend of special effects with story.  &quot;Star Wars&quot; is still one of the greatest films of all time, an  immortal work.</p></body></html>

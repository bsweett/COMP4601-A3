<meta name="summary" content="RIDLEY SCOTT, OPUS 17"></head><body><p>*** 2007. Directed by Ridley Scott. Two nominations for the Oscars and two other for the Golden Globes. The film tells the story of the black NYC mobster who brought, during the Vietnam war, Asian heroin into the U.S.A.. Ridley Scott is no Francis Ford Coppola and no Sergio Leone and AMERICAN GANGSTER is just an average and long movie, without any epic dimension, about the life of a criminal. Already forgotten.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Most Enjoyable American Movie of All Time"></head><body><p>The turn of the century produced a lot of lists including &quot;Best Movies&quot;.  I noted that &quot;Casablanca&quot; ranked right up there with the best American movies of all-time.  Many would argue that it is the BEST movie of all time.  I certainly have in in my top-ten because it is one of those classics where everything came together just right.  The acting is superb and there is a great chemistry between the main characters.  The story-line was exciting, believable, and emotional.  The audience is drawn into the emotion and no one but the hardest boiled eggs among us gets away without a heart-warming or heart-breaking reaction.  The directing is great, the music is memorable, the supporting actors terrific...what else am I missing?  It has it all.  <p>For some the message may be diluted somewhat by time but most of us know from hindsight that this movie takes places in a time of upheaval.  Lives are at stake.  The casino setting is an excellent metaphor for the twists of fate that have affected so many in this corner of the world.  Into this crossroads of humanity come two former lovers who meet unexpectedly.  Their lives have changed since they parted but their love was strong.  What will happen now that they meet again?  This mixture of romance and adventure makes &quot;Casablanca&quot; a movie for everyone.<p>The greatness of &quot;Casablanca&quot; might be best appreciated by speculating on what if the movie HAD been made with Ronald Reagan instead of Humphrey Bogart.  That was supposedly the person the studio initially had in mind for the role of Rick.  Opinions vary on Reagan as President but as an actor he was strictly &quot;B movie&quot; quality.  Make that change or any other of a number of possible changes in the acting, the script, the directing etc. and you would end up with a lesser movie.  That is why &quot;Casablanca&quot; is so loved even after all these years.  It works so well because everything came together just right.  If you have not seen this movie, you must do so.  I recommend that you watch it with your spouse or significant other.  You'll probably always remember the night that you did.</p></body></html>

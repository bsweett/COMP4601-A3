<meta name="summary" content="A worthy sequel that JUST manages to keep it together!"></head><body><p>The third Austin Powers movie, Goldmember, is a fair entry into the series.  The opening credits are great.  The film drags a bit, though, until it finds direction and places itself firmly onto the comedy track.<p>Worth a look.  Rent for a few real belly laughs.  Buy if you're a devoted fan to this irreverant special agent series.</p></body></html>

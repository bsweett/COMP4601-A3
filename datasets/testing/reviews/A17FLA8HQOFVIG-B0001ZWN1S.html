<meta name="summary" content="Great story and fine acting.  A winner!"></head><body><p>Great acting by Marlon Brando, James Caan and Al Pacino. Realistic and believable story.  Highly moral story too, with universal appeal about the choices that a person in power has to make and how it changes his character.  Good screenplay. There was a scene where Al Pacino is the godfather to his sister's child.  He's standing in church with the baby and the priest is chanting religious words about such things as resisting the power of Satan.  While this is going on the scene changes back and forth to the murders that are taking place at that very moment due to Al Pacino's orders.<p>The authenticity of detail was outstanding, giving specificity to the setting and to the individuals.  Each character was unique and interesting. And the dialogue had enough of an edge to feel real.  No wasted words, no wasted action.  This video definitely enhanced my experience of the book.  The only funny thing is that I had a picture in my mind of what Michael Corelone should look like, and it wasn't Al Pacino.  I had pictured this character taller and beefier, with a face that had been distorted by a bullet.  But I really did love this video and highly recommend it.  As a matter of fact, now I want to see the rest of the series.</p></body></html>

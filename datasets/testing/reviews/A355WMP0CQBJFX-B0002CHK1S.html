<meta name="summary" content="THE THINGS ARE AMONG US!!"></head><body><p>they sure didn't give this movie the credit it deserved. i'm telling you john carpenter did it again. man, this movie was extra good. the actors did a phenomenal job, the whole idea was brilliant, and the setting...what better place. who's who. the aliens really do exist among us, but as humans. this one was just plain evil. for it's time the effects were great, personally one of the best. total isolation, the thing, paranoia sets in, distrust, and nowhere to go. all you have is to fight back, whether you're the last man standing. the ending was good, he leaves it all up to you. if they don't kill each other the weather surely will. i do recommend this mind blowing classic.</p></body></html>

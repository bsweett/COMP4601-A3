<meta name="summary" content="Must See Swedish Thriller -"></head><body><p>"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" is based on the book of the same name by author Stieg Larsson.  It is a Swedish film with subtitles but don't let that put you off.  The film immediately catches your attention when Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) enters the room.  She is a young punk who has been hired to work with Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) a investigative journalist who just lost a libel case against a corrupt Swedish CEO.  Blomkvist was hired by Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) an elderly CEO of a group of the Vanger Corporation.  Henrik wants the murderer of his niece, Harriet Vanger, caught.  She disappeared from a family gathering forty years ago on the island owned and inhabited by the Vanger relatives.  Her body was never found, but her Uncle wants the killer found, and he is sure it is a member of the dysfunctional Vanger family.<br /><br />The odd couple detectives, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander work well together.  Lisbeth is a genius in computers and hacking into sites.  Mikael has good analytical skills and slowly finds new clues that Lisbeth follows up on.  The couple link Harriet's disappearance to a number of gory murders from forty years ago and open a Pandora's box of suspects and torture.<br /><br />This movie is a must see, though be aware it is gory and a bit longer than the average movie - almost three hours.</p></body></html>

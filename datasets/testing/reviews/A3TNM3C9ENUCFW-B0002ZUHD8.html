If you are a fan of the excellent "Excalibur" or have even read Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Mallory, then your first reaction to this movie will be "What the ?". That said, I have admiration for a director who dares tread unbroken ground in such a way, and tries to express that stories of old, handed down over the years were probably based on some kind of actual events initially, and this is the premise here. Clive Owen, is a little too workmanlike for my taste as the Revered Knight "Arturious" nee Arthur of the title, born to mixed parents, half English, Half Roman who has spent the last fifteen years of his adult life, roaming England, and fighting heathens in the name of the holy church of Rome. On the eve of his release from Religious servitude, he and his band of hardened knights are sent on a pseudo suicide mission North, to rescue a young boy who may become the next Holy Pope. During his journey, he is awakened to the corruption of the Church, a revelation that rocks the very foundation of all he has held dear all his life. He begins to see his own countrymen (formerly his enemies) as kindred spirits almost, and unites them ultimately to ward off a huge army of Saxon invaders. It's a nice idea, and a nice twist with some inventive back story along the way. Launcelot is here, Gawain, Galahad, Guinevere, and even Merlin as a mystic Celtic style witch doctor, all adding meat to the bones of the legend. The trouble is, the movie tries to encapsulate the legend of the mighty Arthur, and really only serves up a slice or two in an almost episodic retelling. The historical timing and influences of the Roman prescence in the England depicted are credible, and the battle scenes are graphic and impressive, but something always seems missing as you watch. My favorite character was the Saxon King Cerdic played with a battle weary but ruthless malevolence by Stellan Skarsg?rd, who adds more than just balance to the whole picture, and will make you hiss every time he appears almost. Overall not bad, it's worth getting this unrated Directors cut however, as the additional footage makes for a better movie, and the alternate ending is the one that should have been used, instead of the schmaltzy Hollywood one shown. Very enjoyable movie that is almost believable in places, but one wonders if it would have been better as a stand alone story, instead of trying to be the Story behind the story of the legend of Arthur.</p></body></html>

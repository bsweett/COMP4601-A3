Like its main character, the movie insists on marching through the story with a blank-faced, downward-cast look toward the ground. Maybe it succeeds as history. But it fails, utterly, as entertainment.<br /><br />In a committed and thus dull performance, Matt Damon is Edward Wilson, a wonkish Yale grad who's recruited into the CIA by a paralytic general (Robert DeNiro) and a smarmy power broker (William Hurt) to run counterintelligence; that is, infiltrate the communists. The CIA and Russian KGB spent a lot of lives moving them around their global chessboards; Wilson, a secretive, opaque soul, is a perfect fit.<br /><br />Eric Roth's screenplay starts with the Bay of Pigs debacle, as Wilson tries to find the leak that doomed the 1961 mission, and works in flashback to 1939, when Wilson is forced to ditch his deaf sweetheart (Tammy Blanchard) to marry the pregnant Clover (Angelina Jolie), the sister of a classmate. Jolie is ludicrous, all sex, tears, aggression and jeers - the long-suffering wife trapped in a Bette Davis melodrama.<br /><br />DeNiro also directs, pushing the gas on that musical score and dividing the action into inert two-minute chunks. His camera won't linger or deepen our experience, chained, as it is, to Roth's dense, I-did-my-homework screenplay. DeNiro assembled gifted players - Hurt, John Turturro, Michael Gambon, Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, Joe Pesci - and gave them very little motivation. It shows.<br /><br />Roth and DeNiro seem bent on demystifying the CIA and debunking James Bond, Tom Clancy, John Le Carre, "Casablanca" and just about every other artistic foray into the field. Fine. But don't stuff Jolie in there and have us expect credulity. Better yet, watch "Munich" on a loop and see how it's done.</p></body></html>

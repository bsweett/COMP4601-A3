As with every Pixar production, the animation is superb, the characters are compelling and the story resound with everyone. Also, the humor is great.<br /><br />Remy is a rat that dreams to become a chef and his opportunity comes when he meets Linguini, a garbage boy who wants to keep his job. Together, they become the finest chef in France but problems arise in the restaurant and with Remy's family that can jeopardize the whole scheme. I have to say that the best character is Linguini, it's obvious that the animators had a blast animating him because it's so funny and all his mannerisms are executed spectacularly. Themes like family, friendship, passion and more are the core of the film and everything is enveloped in a beautiful score by the great Michael Giacchino. The animation is a sight to behold. Paris looks so beautifully breathtaking and the food looks so deliciously real that you will get real hungry while watching the film. Ratatouille is Pixar's 8th triumph and one they should be very proud about. A wonderful film.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br />Ratatouille comes to BD looking absolutely fantastic. This is hardly a surprise being a Pixar film but still the transfer mesmerize. Colors jump off the screen, detail and contrast are terrific and no compression artifacts whatsoever. Simply amazing.<br /><br />The 5.1 uncompressed audio is also amazing with fidelity and clarity beyond your expectations. Spectacular.<br /><br />Bonus Material:<br />Ratatouille comes with a nice assortment of bonus features although is not as loaded as other Pixar films. First you have a documentary "Fine food and Film" which is a conversation with director Brad Bird and top chef Thomas Keller. It's a fantastic piece where you learn how they chose their careers and how passionate they are about it. You have two great shorts "Lifted" and "Your Friend the Rat". You also have making of featurettes that deals with all the aspects of the production of the film including story, characters, music, design and more. You also have a gallery, a game, publicity material and deleted scenes.<br /><br />A DVD copy is also included.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br />Ratatouille is another Pixar Triumph that everyone should see and own. This BD is great with terrific Video & Audio quality and many hours of bonus material and comes Highly Recommended!!!</p></body></html>

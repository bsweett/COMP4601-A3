<meta name="summary" content="Memento has amazed the world like no movie in recent times."></head><body><p>If you haven't seen Memento yet, Lord have mercy on your soul, run down to the video shop right now and rent a copy. This movie is truly unmissable. It has been highly praised by critics and audiences alike, and in general has Wowed the world. I mean, it even earned a place on the IMDb Top 10 (out of 250!) films of all time. That is pretty impressive. I can see exactly why the world loves the movie. It's different, exhilarating, amazingly engaging, original, smart, involving and endlessly entertaining. Memento is just everything you want out of a smart and fun movie. You truly get your money's worth with this one. Now, where should I start? Hmm, yes, Christopher Nolan. What a guy. He put his heart and soul into this movie and has come up with a true original. The script was actually adapted from a short story but extended to a film that seems so totally new and fresh you would never guess it had been adapted from anything. Christopher's direction is brilliant. He uses black and white for the unforgettable flashback scenes and colour for the scenes that are happening at that time. The film pretty goes backwards but is never confusing if you watch it carefully. Another great thing at the movie is Guy Pearce. He is one heck of a performer! While not only truly believable, he somehow possesses his character into amazing form. We never really know if Pearce is acting or not. There are plenty more great things about the movie. The editing is effective, especially within the first few minutes. The voice-overs help you to understand where the movie is taking itself. Carrie Anne-Moss's character is very intriguing. This movie is shocking, intriguing and truly unforgettable. If you haven't seen it by the time I've finished blabbing about how good it was, then you should get help. Preferably professional.</p></body></html>

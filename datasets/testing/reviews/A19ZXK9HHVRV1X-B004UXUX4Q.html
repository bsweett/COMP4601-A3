<meta name="summary" content="A human drama that is both intimate and epic"></head><body><p>In the tradition of "Kramer vs. Kramer" and "Ordinary People," "The Descendants" is a high-toned social drama centered around the complex dynamics of familial relationships. Like those other films, it also won wide critical praise and a boatload of award nominations the year it was released.<br /><br />Matt King is a wealthy, workaholic businessman living in Hawaii with his wife and two daughters, the older of whom is a rebellious teen who's recently been shipped off to boarding school on another island. As the movie opens, we learn that Matt's world has begun to crash in on him big time as his wife lies in a coma brought on by a boating accident. Matt struggles not only with the guilt of having been an emotionally distant husband but with raising two precocious and challenging children, who are deep in the throes of typical growing pains and whom he barely seems to know at this point. He also has to deal with the complications of selling some of the valuable property he inherited from his wealthy ancestors to developers who may not be as attuned as he is to the natural beauty and ecological richness of the land.<br /><br />With a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by Nat Faxon, Jim Rash and director Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, the movie neatly sidesteps all the potential melodrama inherent in the material. The plot constantly wanders off onto interesting and unexpected bypaths, and characters who seem as if they could become easily pigeonholed refuse to do or say what we expect them to do or say. No one is a hero or a villain; they're all just ordinary folks trying to lead decent lives, though often falling far short of that mark, as we all do. Indeed, there is an air of verisimilitude to this film that is a rare commodity in modern commercial moviemaking. At every moment, we feel as if are watching real people acting in real ways - just as if actual life were unfolding before us. In fact, there is not a single false moment to be found anywhere in the film.<br /><br />This is thanks, in no small measure, to George Clooney who has never given a truer or more deeply vulnerable performance than he does here, utilizing his innate good-guy persona to astonishing effect. Ditto for Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller who play his two daughters with unerring believability and conviction. Their interactions with one another are indeed a wonder to behold.<br /><br />With admirable restraint, director Alexander Payne is content to let the drama speak for itself. He has the decency to pull back and give the characters their space without feeling it necessary to push his points or exploit the audience's emotions. Yet, there is a lovely, hypnotic flow to the movie that draws us into both the tropical setting (how many movies set in Hawaii are about people who actually live there?) and the lives of these ordinary people who are suffering through an extraordinary - yet, at the same time, utterly universal - ordeal.<br /><br />A human drama that is as intimate as it is epic, "The Descendants" is one of the most profound and moving film-going experiences of recent years.</p></body></html>

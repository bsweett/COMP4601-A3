The Searchers offers a realistic view of the West after the Civil War. The acting, the scenery, and the music produce a touch of the innocent beauty and of the awful brutality of life in the old west. Big John Wayne is the macho king, driven to find his niece, a captive of the Comanche. This film is a classic of its kind.</p></body></html>

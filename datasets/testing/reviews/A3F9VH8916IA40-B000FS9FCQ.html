Instead of getting an in your face action flick about some do gooder we get a political film about an oppressive government using fear tactics to keep its people under control. And V is out to stop them. But is V really the heroic freedom fighter we are led to believe? Or has he become an evil himself? Who is V? Is he just some random guy? Is he some lunatic? Is he Eve's father? We don't really know. And even at the end of the movie we don't have a clue.<br /><br /> V for Vendetta is set is the near future in London England. Something has happened that has left the United States in ruins and the rest of the world in poverty. In England an evil fanatic has seized control of the government. By using the fear of terrorist and diesis this new leader is able to keep the people under his iron grip. It is not a total nightmare government the way Gorge Orwell's 1984 was, but give it some time and it could get that way. Than out from no where comes V who brings with him a message of hope. He wants to start a revolution and overthrow the government. His tactic is to destroy parliament and kill the dictator.<br /><br /> Obviously this movie is very political and not for the easily offended. If you can not stand people challenging your views than by all means skip this move. It will just make you faint anyway. Save yourself the aggravation. But for the rest of us who like debating other peoples views instead of slandering them, this is an amazing film. True it does some in fact talk about the Bush administration and the war against terror but reasonable people will not go out and slander the movie just for that. I am a republican Christian who is against gay marriage, and this movie has some pointed things to say about all of that. The government is a far right extremist group that justifies its actions somehow by saying it is the will of God. They murder Muslims and gay's and forbid any religion except Christianity while they try to justify what they are doing. But this movie doesn't just say "republicans are evil bla bla bla" it make its point in a very well written way. Muslims and gays are seen as people instead as enemies that so many people seem to think they are. Extreme right wing Christian fanatics are seen as just a dangeres as Muslim extremist, as in fact they are. Of course this movie slant to the left, but it does have a good message. Like don't ever give up your freedom, no matter what. Do not allow your government to use fear tactics to scare you into letting up your liberties. Never stop fighting, and if you must die for what you believe.<br /><br /> V for Vendetta is a very good film, do yourself a favor and go see it.</p></body></html>

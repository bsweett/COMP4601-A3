<meta name="summary" content="Great Film"></head><body><p>Everyone put in a great performance in this movie, Christopher Walkin (doesn't he ever play anything other than a psycho in the movies?). I thought this film looked interesting when it first came out in the theaters but never got around to watching it. Johnny Depp shows his ability to create unique characters in his portrayal of Constable Ichabob Crane in this rendition of the classic tale. The film keeps you wondering throughout.</p></body></html>

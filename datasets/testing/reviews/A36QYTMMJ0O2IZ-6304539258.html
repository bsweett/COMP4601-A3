<meta name="summary" content="Star Wars Changed the Cinema For All-Time"></head><body><p>Transport yourself back to 1977 when this film was first released.  I still remember the awe and incredible feeling when walking out of the theater after seeing Star Wars.  There had never truly been anything like it before.  Star Wars completely revolutionized cinematic films forever.  You could understand why suddenly hundreds and thousands of people all over the globe were standing in long lines waiting to get in to see this spectacular film.<br /><br />Every once in a while, sometimes a long while, a movie comes along that completely changes how movies are done.  They are so different, because nobody has done anything like it before.  Star Wars is such a film.  Perhaps no other film in history has had as much impact on today's culture and society that Star Wars has.  It operates on physical, philosophical, mythological, and even spiritual levels.<br /><br />"Jaws" may have set the standard for the typical summer blockbuster, but Star Wars blew the doors off, and in many ways, raised the bar dramatically for all films that would ever follow in its footsteps.<br /><br />Ironically, the story is a simple one, and George Lucas drew on many sources for his story that takes place in a galaxy far, far away.  He used old Saturday serials, Japanese samurai and mythology, as well as drawing a bit on King Arthur, and still others.  This helped to set up for one of the most incredible movies to ever grace the big screen.<br /><br />Lucas was also smart in setting up a merchandising line of toys, t-shirts, lunchboxes, etc, and sat back and watched as the millions of dollars rolled on in.<br /><br />The Empire Strikes Back is, in my opinion, the best Star Wars film of the six, but the original Star Wars is tough to beat.  How many kids dreamed of being taken away from their hum-drum life (like Luke on the farm) to suddenly find themselves immersed in a huge galactic adventure, complete with a beautiful princess to rescue, and being the hero who destroys the massive Death Star.<br /><br />We saw things that weren't really popular until Star Wars revealed them.  We saw laser blasters being used, flying spaceships that engage in dogfights in outer space, strange and exotic creatures, and one of the ultimate items, the lightsaber.  Every kid loves sword-fighting, but to do it with a laser sword is the ultimate experience.<br /><br />Take a good look at the top box office hits of all time.  9 of the top 10 movies are science fiction/fantasy films.  People love these kinds of stories.  They always have!  It doesn't matter if it's Lord of the Rings, the Lone Ranger, Spider-Man, Superman, or Star Wars.  We like be taken to a different world, a world of the fantastic.<br /><br />I loved the original version of this film.  I didn't really see the need to change it.  Granted, there are some scenes in the newer version that work really well, but somehow, it doesn't bring back the nostalgic feelings like the original version does.  I like this DVD version because it gives me the option to watch either one.  There are times when I like to watch the updated version, and yet still, there are others when I feel like watching the original.  At least Lucas gives us a choice here.<br /><br />I'm writing this review on the eve of the 30th anniversary of Star Wars, and it's still one of my all-time favorite films, because every so often, I feel like being transported again to a galaxy far, far away.</p></body></html>

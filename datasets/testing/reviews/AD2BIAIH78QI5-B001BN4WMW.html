<meta name="summary" content="Spartacus in a Kilt"></head><body><p>That's one way of looking at &quot;Braveheart&quot;, with Mel Gibson playing the Scottish national hero, William Wallace. Like Spartacus, Wallace was also a real-life person. Like Spartacus, he strove against a mighty oppressor nation that was destroying the liberty of others. And like Spartacus, Wallace died for his cause in a brutal fashion.<p>I saw &quot;Braveheart&quot; after I returned from a moving trip to Scotland, where I learned of the brave hero from countrymen who still love and revere him, centuries after his struggles for their liberty. I heard in advance from them where there are inaccuracies in the story (the Battle of Stirling was fought on a bridge, for instance, not a plain), but still and all, I found it a moving depiction of man's fight against injustice. Mel Gibson turned in a great performance of Wallace, and Patrick McGoohan as the evil King Edward of England was wickedly good as well.<p>If you're found of Kirk Douglas as Spartacus, then you'll be very happy with Mel Gibson's epic, too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A DVD review"></head><body><p>This is my favorite Star Trek film. The characters satirize themselves and it has an interesting story. The picture and sound are excellent. The featurette is an excellent 'making of' feature that runs about 30 minutes.  Nimoy gives some interesting information on the making of the film. I think  this is a must DVD in any sci-fi fans' collection.</p></body></html>

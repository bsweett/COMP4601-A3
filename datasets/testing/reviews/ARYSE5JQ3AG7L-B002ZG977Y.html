It reminded me of Star Wars. You'll know what character I mean when you watch it.<br /><br />You know the story. There weren't any glaring errors. There was tongue in cheek humor. Io was hot! ;)<br /><br />It's even a good family movie to watch because it espouses values.<br /><br />Teamwork people!<br />Nobody can go it alone.<br />;)</p></body></html>

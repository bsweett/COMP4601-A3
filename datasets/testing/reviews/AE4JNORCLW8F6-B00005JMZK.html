<meta name="summary" content="Forget what you've heard. This film rocks."></head><body><p>This film was recommended to me by a friend who's definitely not a fan of sci-fi. Even though it's a sci-fi movie, it has mass appeal. The characters, action and unique plot development deserve attention. Every element is well done. I've never watched any of the Alien or Predator movies, but I wasn't lost. Nor did the movie resort to lame explanations to 'catch up' the viewers who haven't seen the other films. It's sci-fi, so, of course, this isn't a 'based on a true story' kind of film. Expect the excitement and futuristic ideas that would characterize a film of this nature. It's an exciting rush. I was not disappointed.</p></body></html>

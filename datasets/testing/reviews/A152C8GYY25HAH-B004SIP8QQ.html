<meta name="summary" content="Part 2 of a very long and very GOOD movie"></head><body><p>"Kill Bill Vol. 2" is the second half of a VERY long but VERY good movie by `cult' director Quentin Tarantino. Its distributor, fearing audiences would not sit through a movie over three hours long, decided that it be released in two parts. How this effected boxoffice I do not know. I do know that it is best viewed in its entirety. Movies running this long are rare but hardly without precedent. In 1939 MGM was faced with a similar problem with "Gone With the Wind", which clocked in at over 3 and ? hours. Initially, the studio planned to release the movie in two parts. Ultimately, a decision was reached to release it in the long format, albeit with an intermission. This proved to be a brilliant plan, and the movie went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time.<br /><br />In volume 2, The Bride [Uma Thurman] continues to exact her revenge. She continues to hunt down those who will lead her to "Bill", the man who mastermind the mass murder that occurred at her wedding.<br /><br />Tarantino strikes me as a `child-like' director, a boy who is mesmerized by all things related to movies. I mean this in a positive way. He sees things in a way a `child' would see them. So, perhaps, did Orseon Welles, or Mozart, for that matter. Vision is not a thing defined by age.</p></body></html>

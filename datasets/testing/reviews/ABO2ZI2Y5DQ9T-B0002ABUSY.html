<meta name="summary" content="Great Horror Flim of Modern Age: Gripping and Chilling"></head><body><p>The newer "Dawn of the Dead" has a simple, yet great opening, in which Sarah Polly (!), the heroine of the film, witnesses the end of the world.  It's a dynamite opening, and as it shows, Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of the George A. Romero classic lives up to its name.  In short, it's a must for any horror fans.<p>The new "DOTD" basically follows the same route.  Sarah Polly's nurse Anna is suddenly attacked by a group of zombies, and is trapped in a shoping mall as a makeshift fort, where she and other survivers have to think of the way of survival.  The "living" include; Ving Rhames (as a tough cop), Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer (and his love), and others, plus a dog 'Chips.'  You can see among them the faces like Matt Frewer, and from the original there are cameos of Scott Reinger, Tom Savini, and Ken Foree, all of whom appear on TV. <p>The newer one has made a big change: the zombies run, and run very fast.  While Romero's zombies walked like old-fashioned robot, the updated 'un-dead' run wild, which is really scary.  Though the rule of "bullet in the head" is the same as old, the survival gets harder than before, and consequently the film gives greater number of characters, which have to go one after another.<p>Interesting thing is, this "DOTD" knows that good horror films need inevitably a slight amount of humor (dark ones), and it does not fail to give that to us.  The "KILL ROSIE GAME" played with another surviver who happens to live in a gunshop across the street makes you laugh, embarrasingly perhaps.  It's a guilty pleasure, sure, but what did you expect from a film titled like this?<p>We have two big surprises -- one, you never dreamed of seeing Sarah Polly, who had been in mainly indie films like "My Life without Me," in Hollywood's major horror film.  The casting works tremendouly, because as you know, she can really act (like Drew Barrymore, she was a good example of successful ex-child actor).  Two, the real surprise is that this is the feature debut of director Zack Snyder, whose impressive visual sense matches the storytelling skills.  Want to remake "Superman"?  GIve it to him. <p>Actions are bloody, full of gore splutterd across the screen, but, well, this is supposed to be so, and as such "DOTD" delivers.  The film is appropriately loud and violent, but occasional tongue-in-cheek moments tell us that this is an entertainment.  Not a healthy one, maybe, but certainly gripping and chilling, with a bit of funny.</p></body></html>

I had little expectations going in, other than the fact that Tom Hanks (of all people) was playing a hitman. I hadn't (and still haven't seen, at the time of this review) American Beauty and only knew who Sam Mendes was by name, and not reputation. Back then, I thought the movie was pretty good. I saw it mostly as a revenge-themed story, liked the bits of character development throughout, and enjoyed the overall aesthetic feel of post-Depression 1930s gangster-dom. Today, after having developed a better sense of awareness and taste for a film's writing, I am completely blown away by the level of depth in story and character on this subsequent viewing. Plot summary aside, I find Road to Perdition to be everything I remember and so much more. It's a coming-of-age story for sons, a resolution for fathers, a testament to the brutality of violence, and an emotional tale about the preservation of innocence all brilliantly disguised in the form of a revenge thriller. I was particularly engrossed by the parallel relationships shared between father and son through all forms: Sullivan and his son, Rooney and his son, then Rooney and Sullivan Sr. The similarities shared between the father-son pairings make for some very quaint and believable bonds, while still managing to make these characters empathetic. Without revealing too much, the story possesses a lot of thematic value and is a very moving drama that tells a masterful story through a lost setting that we just don't see much of anymore (that is, the 1930s gangster era). Tom Hanks is in top form as Sullivan Sr. with outstanding support performances by Daniel Craig, Stanley Tucci, Jude Law, Tyler Hoechlin, and the late Paul Newman. It's great that the film won an award for Cinematography and was nominated for some other technical categories, but nothing for Best Picture, Director, or Actor? Oh well, regardless of Oscar snubs, I'm happy to say this is definitely a new all-time favorite for me now.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />As mentioned, Road to Perdition won an Academy Award for Cinematography, and with good reason. The picture looks gorgeously bleak. Colors are subdued, with a lot of grays, charcoals, and solid blacks being the focus. Primaries don't make much of an appearance apart from the happier moments outside in the sunlight or in any scenes where blood is present. But despite the photography, they look as good as can be. Skin tones have a very natural presentation to them and never feel too pale or over-saturated, providing for some very fine textures in hair and face wrinkles. By far the most eye-catching aspect of the camera work is the black levels. Blacks are super deep and inky, with some especially excellent line and shadow delineation amidst the many, many darkly-lit scenes and layers of clothes being worn. The detail is so great, and I was really impressed at being able to see all the little things I don't think I ever noticed on the DVD, like the scene where Hanks goes into the night club and you can clearly see the paper over the gun and lamp shades shaking to the music, or when Hanks is walking on the street in the dark and you can see all the linings between his vest, suit, and overcoat. The image is one of the finest I've seen on BD to date. Unfortunately, while just about everything else is preserved, the only detractor would be the very frequent amounts of dirt and debris throughout. Aside from that one little mishap, the picture is essentially perfect.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Unlike the video, however, the audio comes across just fine and dandy. As soon as the film started and I heard the sound of the waves crashing, I knew I would be in for good things from a sound perspective. Buoyancy is a word I use a lot for audio descriptions and is a term I like to think of as identifying a quality of "pop" to the presentation, much like the editors and critics use for the video portions of a review. Well, the DTS-HD track here really does have a pop to it, and right from the get-go. Directionality and separation offer all kinds of goodness from proper placement to panning, to flawless mixing between dialogue and music. The sound crew was nominated for a couple of Oscars in both mixing and editing, and this BD shows exactly why. Every subtle sound, high and low, front, left, right, and back are handled with a great amount of care and detail. The dialogue is always pitch-perfect and never distorts through the center, while the occasional background noise, street crowd, blowing of wind, and car engine add a good deal of depth to the city of Chicago. Thomas Newman's score (another shocking fact to know he hasn't won an Oscar yet) sounds wonderful and emotionally stirring, propelling the drama on-screen, yet never overpowering the dialogue or sound effects. And as for the sound effects, gunshots dominate the sound field and conquer with just cause when need be. I believe this is my first time hearing a Tommy Gun in lossless audio, and boy is it frightening. LFEs are mostly inherent within the music, background and score-wise, but have a particularly great moment during the passing of a subway train when we first meet Jude Law's character. This is definitely reference material.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />From the DVD we get the basic making-of featurette, deleted scenes with optional commentary, and extremely poignant feature film commentary by Sam Mendes. The making-of is really as basic as it comes and isn't much to talk about. The deleted scenes provide a little more context to the story that we might not have known, yet are still surprised by. And the commentary by Mendes is as good as they come. Next to Michael Mann and Christopher Nolan, this one of the best commentaries I've heard. He's very into the explanation of the film, both from a technical and literary viewpoint, and really gets in-depth with a lot of the explanations concerning what he wanted to convey on-screen, how he did it, or why/how it's different from the original graphic novel. New to the BD is an introduction by Mendes to this new and impressive Blu-ray edition, a retrospect on the life and career of the film's master cinematographer, the late Conrad L. Hall, and an interactive library explaining some of the period elements of the film. At this point, I'm just now making it a habit of getting to know some of the technicians behind the camera, in addition to the many other important names I feel are important. And I have to say, after seeing the feature on Mr. Hall, my interest in the man has really peaked now. Before seeing this film, I knew photography could make a world of difference in the way a movie feels. And for as good as his craft was in Road to Perdition, I really am curious to see his other works at some point. As for the new library archive, I found it very interesting in terms of content, but the tiny screen thing was a problem. I'm pretty sure it can't be blown up, but personally, I wish they had just put it all together as a regular HD featurette. For what it is, though, it's full of some pretty good, albeit sparse, information.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />I thought the movie was pretty good when I first saw it. But knowing what I know now, and with the help of Blu-ray, I have to say I really love the film. It's a character drama that's full of heart and really draws a lot of empathy from me, personally. With Grade-A quality in all aspects of both technical and literary departments, the film is an extreme joy for me to watch, thanks in huge part to the cinematography, cast, and score. The A/V specs are definitely the pinnacle of BD technology, and it's nice to even get a blessing from Mendes himself (an admitted skeptic, initially). Add to that a great set of special features, and you have yourself a must-own piece of film-making brought graciously to you by Paramount.</p></body></html>

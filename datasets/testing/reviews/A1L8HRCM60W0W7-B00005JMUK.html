<meta name="summary" content="GRIPPING BIOPIC"></head><body><p>Is it simply a potrait or a posthumous appeal with a subject convenient enough to include enough violence and gore to make Hollywood-smitten fans line up? The film is such a dense, compelling story with amazing performances that it leaves you asking WHY its protagonist was driven to commit those highway murders..<p>Not that "Monster" asks us to feel sorry for Wuornos, a Florida prostitute who killed seven men in the 1980s. The director asks only that we try to understand her. Theron's performance reveals a confused young woman who became a prostitute at 13 after being continually raped by her father's best friend and then being blamed and beaten by her father when he found out. <p>As a movie that attempts to psychoanalyzes a serial killer's idiosynchracies, this movie is nowhere near some of the better classics (e.g., the Hannibal Lecter series, Midnight Cowboy, Badlands etc etc) but it is an interesting, well-made potrayal of the real-life Wuornos. I was intrigued to the point of googling for Wuronos and found that www.crimelibrary.com/serial4/wuornos/ has some good information that dispels the hyperbole surrounding this disturbed character. <p>Theron's performance is of course brave and tortured. But I was even more impressed with Ricci, whose mannerisms aren't as noticeable. Her subtle performance as Wuornos' pathetically optimistic girlfriend comes closer to breaking the heart.<p>Despite knowing the denouement -- Aileen Wuornos is such a known quantity that we do know where she's going (death row) -- it's the sense of utter unpredictability that makes "Monster" so gripping. Theron and Ricci are so absorbing, and Jenkins' direction so deft, that we root for history to take a turn it can't possibly take, and for Aileen and Selby to live happily ever.<p>Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Emotionally Compelling But 'Less Is More' Approach Might Have Been Better"></head><body><p>The real-life story of Port Authority officers caught up in the 9/11 tragedy opens with quiet and realistic descriptions of their jobs in New York. The whole tragedy is depicted as seen from the viewpoints of these hard-working officers and their families, and the film is given strength because of this narrative approach as far as its opening 30 minutes go.<br /><br />One of the film's horrifying scenes is, of course, the first chapters where the panic is shown after two airplanes hit the Twin Towers. Oliver Stone presents us what we witnessed on TV then from another viewpoint - I don't repeat it here - and though it is true that he restrained himself from showing too much, he still seems to have been tempted. I can say the scenes of the officers arriving World Trade Center is realistic, and maybe too realistic to some.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage with low-key performance plays Jim McLoughlin, real-life officer who knows the place better than anyone. What happened to Jim McLoughlin, Will Jimeno, another actual person (played by Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and other officers of the rescue team is described next, which is simply terrifying. The story of the film's earlier part is told fast and straightforward, and what they experienced is conveyed convincingly to us.<br /><br />And then, after the collapse of the buildings the film starts to use another narrative technique, switching between the officers trapped underground and their families waiting at home. Then things get a little - how should I say? - not good. I respect those people involved in the filmmaking, but why Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello? Or why Nicholas Cage in the first place? I am not talking about their talent (which I am ready to admit), but no matter what they do, their faces are recognizable as Maggie, Maria and Nicholas. Somewhere in my mind I feel they are acting.<br /><br />And this is the part I disagree with the film. Though `World Trade Center's is based on true story, it sometimes makes us feel otherwise. Though its timeline is compressed, the story gets slow and some images look clich&eacute;d. Maybe I should not say this, I know, but the frequent flashbacks showing the happy days, the film's big visual and sound effects and occasional soundtrack music are clearly those of Hollywood films. I'm not saying that Hollywood studios are all bad; I can feel the goodwill of the people involved in making this film. I'm only saying that there may be another approach better than the one employed here: no `stars,' no effects, just facts.<br /><br />This leads us to the inevitable comparison with `United 93.' It is not fair to compare them because these two incidents are not the same, yes, I know, but I need to do it to make my point. Paul Greengrass succeeded in shooting his film about the hijacked airplane which is emotionally involved by making it very lean. And Oliver Stone's film is also lean and effective up until the moment when the film attempts to tell another story -- story about the family, which, I think, needs and deserves another film to tell.<br /><br />`World Trade Center' has moving scenes as well as very disturbing ones. Despite its undeniable merits, however, you will feel the film is uneven and perhaps a bit sentimental. As to the sentimentality, I confess that I also shared the feeling while watching, but I still don't know if I was right in feeling that way.</p></body></html>

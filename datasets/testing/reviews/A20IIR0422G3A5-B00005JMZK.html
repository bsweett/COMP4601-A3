Anderson is almost inevidably seen as pure exploitation of characters from earlier popular movies, especially since the whole premise was suggested by s quick shot near the end of `Predator 2' when we see an obvious `Alien' skeleton in the trophy case of the predator. This means the expectation invariably is that it will fall many cuts below it's exemplars, especially since the original films were directed by the likes of Ridley Scott and James Cameron. So, my mission is to examine just how this film inevitably fails to live up to its stellar parents.<br /><br />The first thing which strikes me is that the story falls into the same trap of every poorly written action thriller, in that no sooner do the major characters get to their dangerous venue than they start to do stupid things. The stupidity is so blatent here that the lead character, Sanaa Lathan, playing the ice climbing expert / guide has to point this out. The other side of this coin is that since we know perfectly well that this Antarctic venue will house at least one, or both of the most horrific alien monsters ever invented, which immediately spoils almost all of the mystery behind the story. When James Cameron did `Aliens', we also knew there was evil afoot on the `Alien' planet, but Cameron's point of view and strong characters made up for this lack of surprise. I found several other oddities in the story, such as the inconsistency between the object of the pyramid and the fact that the visiting predator warriors killed off the humans they found at the scene.<br /><br />Another problem is that this cast simply did not hold a candle to the strong casts of `Alien', `Aliens', `Predator', and `Predator 2'. No matter how good Sanaa Lathan was in the lead role, she simply could not hold a candle to the iconic performances and role of Ripley created by Sigourny Weaver (at the cost of being forever typecast into this persona). In spite of some earnest attempts, I simply could not connect with these characters as easily as I could sympathise with Schwarzenneger and Co in `Predator' or Cameron's excellent cast in `Aliens'. The only character with whom I developed any sympathy was `Aliens' and `Terminator' veteran, Lance Hendriksen's character.<br /><br />And, in spite of the `de rigeur' good special effects, the real attention getters were the great inventions of the original monster creations by H. R. Geiger (Alien) and Stan Winston (Predator), based on an idea by James Cameron.<br /><br />In general, I found the technical aspects of the filming and editing to detract rather than add to the experience. In one of the voiceover commentaries, the director said they made a point of making it dark, over anticipated studio objections. Well, I think the studio got it right. The fast action is even harder to appreciate in the dark than it would be in a well lit scene. Ridley Scott is famous for `dark' scenes (see especially `Blade Runner'), but he also seems to have the technique to carry it off.<br /><br />In balance, the movie still managed to entertain with a reasonably interesting, albeit totally fantastic premise and a closure to the rampaging aliens which fell well within believability, given the facts available from earlier movies. It was certainly better than some other stinker FX action works such as `Van Helsing' and `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'.</p></body></html>

I almost fell asleep. I knew what was going to happen in the end and throughout the whole movie, I just couldnt understand why people love this movie so much. It was pretty useless. When I hear people call it a 'cult classic', I laugh, its just too absurd. I will not be listening to hyped up nonsense anymore.</p></body></html>

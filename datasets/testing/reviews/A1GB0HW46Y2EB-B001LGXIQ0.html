Both movies had large casts of talented performers, had a ton of money thrown at them and, for the most part simply laid there failing to fulfill their primary goals: to make audiences laugh.  Neither director had had very much experience in the comedy field, a serious handicap, which brings me immediately to Woody Allen, the most talented writer of comedy over the past fifty years, who, initially at least, had no experience in directing a motion picture.  The least of his films --  of those that he both wrote and directed -- leave both of the above films in the dust being successful and often brilliant achievements in screen comedy.  Steven Spielberg recalled the preview of "1941" at a local theater in Los Angeles.  "We stood in the lobby and the audience became quieter and quieter.  I went in and looked and several people had their hands over their ears.  I knew we were in trouble."  Today, the most successful comedy films, i.e. films that are actually funny, are those written and directed by the Coen brothers.<br /><br />I didn't watch many of the television episodes of "Get Smart" as I had largely given up watching commercial television programs by that time, but I had seen Don Adams perform many times and he was an undoubted expert as a standup comedian, having funny material and flawless comedic timing, without which, the program "Get Smart" would never have been the success that it was.  Mel Brooks, Buck Henry, Don Adams and many others shared writing credit for the series.<br /><br />Steve Carell who plays the lead in the film "Get Smart" does not impress me as a professional comedian.  I'm not certain what he is, but the one thing that he is not is funny.  Likewise the director, Peter Segal, shows little of the comedic abilities of Woody Allen or the Coen brothers with the result that nearly all of the attempts at screen comedy misfire here.  The director apparently decided to substitute fancy special effects in lieu of competant comedy writing.  The mistakes that are made in the film are numerous:  One example is Carell talking amorously to someone off camera, whom we are initially led to believe, must be an attractive woman.  But the shot of Carell talking runs too long without a cut which prematurely tells us that he is not talking to a woman.  When the cut finally does occur it turns out to be a cute little dog which does not play funny because the joke has already been sprung ahead of time.  In the trade this is known as telegraphing your punch line.  This is the fault of both the director and editor and the film is generally clumsy in this regard.  The scene in the airplane restroom with the darts misfiring is mildly funny the first time, but it goes on and on and simply becomes painful to watch.  The "comic" dance number with the overweight girl is both cruel and crude.  The joke about the poison capsule lays an egg due to inept writing.  In the hands of Woody Allen, this would have been written to be funny.<br /><br />As the film goes on (and it does go on -- and on!) it becomes less of a comedy (if that were possible) and more of a high-tech actioner indicating that apparently no one involved had a clear idea of what the film was actually intended to be, the final 20 minutes essentially being an incoherent mess of special effects and chases.<br /><br />For those of us old enough to remember the "Fibber McGee & Molly" radio show: when Fibber McGee would spring a joke that got groans instead of a laugh, Molly would say,  "T'ain't funny, McGee."  That pretty much sums up this film.</p></body></html>

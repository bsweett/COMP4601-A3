<meta name="summary" content="Two Disc Set is Great: a Very Extreme Viewing"></head><body><p>Make no mistake about it, this is not a film about the "Rise and Levelling of " an arms dealer. Not at all. Yes its a documentary thinly disguised as a drama, and a very good drama at that, but its facts are most certainly correct, and going by the commentary, and the actual  documentary on disc two, this is a watered down version of the facts.<br /><br />The Film's audio is great, the CGI is almost invisible, as the director mentions. This is one case where the CGI  assists in the story telling.<br /><br />Disc one is straightforward, the film with Commmentary, and in some awesome DTS  audio.<br /><br />Disc two has a collection of deleted  scenes that SHOULD  have been kept in my view, and I do not know why they were sliced. The making of feature is very revealing, and even shows how even this film could not have been made without  arms dealers.The documentary on the arms trade is scary because it really shows just how correct the film is, and in fact how understated the film is, if not less than the truth... since if the truth were shown, no one would buy it. Also, there is an interactive guide to the guns of the film, quite a good addition.<br /><br />If you do not want to have information on the trade that this film talks about, then get the one disc version.However, the two disc version is an awesome work, and a great film done outside of the regular studio system.</p></body></html>

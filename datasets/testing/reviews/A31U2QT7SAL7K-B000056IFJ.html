<meta name="summary" content="Man plus Machine equals Schwarzenegger!"></head><body><p>Entertainment Weekly recently touted the first sequel ("Terminator 2: Judgment Day") to this film as being one of The Twenty-Five Best Action Films of all time.  That title may be an accurate assessment of the non-stop action of the sequel but what would it have been without its predecessor which ranks as one of the best science fiction commentaries on the path that we may be going with our computer-dependent society.<br /><br />James Cameron scored a casting coup when he gave the role to Arnold.  At the time, the muscle-bound actor had had a few films under his belt, films that played mostly on his physical appearance and his novice acting skills.  "The Terminator" character was short on dialogue but Cameron made the best of his star by providing him with one-line zingers and stares that could wake the dead.<br /><br />To call the part "tailor-made" for Schwarzenegger would be a major understatement.  He was muy perfecto.<br /><br />Linda Hamilton, not yet the household name that she would become for TV's "Beauty and the Beast," as well as not yet the future "Mrs. James Cameron," is appropriately confused and terrified as the waitress that would ultimately become the mother of the man that would rescue humanity.<br /><br />Michael Biehn is well-cast as the other traveler from the future, intent on preventing Arnold's malevolent cyborg from doing his killing-thing.<br /><br />Stan Winston's effects still hold their own after almost a quarter of a century.</p></body></html>

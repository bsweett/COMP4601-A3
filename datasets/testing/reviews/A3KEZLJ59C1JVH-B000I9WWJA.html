<meta name="summary" content="Original and entertaining"></head><body><p>"Inside Man" appears to be about a robbery at a large Manhattan bank, but there's much more to it than what meets the eye. Denzel Washington plays NYPD Detective Keith Frazier, who attempts to outsmart the mastermind of the bank robbery (Clive Owen). However, what appears to be an "ordinary" robbery/hostage situation turns out to be a personal vendetta to expose evil secrets from long ago. Throw Jodie Foster into the mix as a mysterious problem solver of sorts, and you end up with a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />There are quite a few holes in the plot, but "Inside Man" is definitely a lot of fun to watch, although I doubt I'll ever sit down and watch it again. It's much more refreshing than the so-called "thrillers" Hollywood has been cranking out recently, so that in itself is a relief. This is an entertaining film with a lot of great one-liners and an excellent cast. Check it out now while it's playing on Comcast On Demand!</p></body></html>

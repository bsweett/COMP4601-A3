<meta name="summary" content="Too bad it spirals into silliness."></head><body><p>The remake of the Manchurian Candidate starts out slowly, buildings intrigue and suspense, and then jumps into pool filled with giant rubber balls and rubber ducks.  No, not literally!  But there is a moment in this film--when Denzel Washington starts surfing the net to find answers--that the film sets off on a trajectory so implausible, so goofy, and so ridiculous that all the build up, all the visual grace, all the fine acting (Meryl Streep in particular), is utterly and completely wasted.<br /><br />Now, the trajectory in question is not so different than the original, but the tone of this version is so somber, so serious, so heavy, that you can't abandon the need for gritty, realistic answers halfway through the film.  The original Manchurian Candidate didn't take itself half as seriously, and that's why it succeeded where this version fails.<br /><br />A couple of notes:  Meryl Streep is channelling Hillary Clinton (her denials notwithstanding), and Denzel Washington obviously watched a bunch of Pacino films before settling on this character.</p></body></html>

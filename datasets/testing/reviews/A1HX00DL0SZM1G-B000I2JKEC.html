In fact it holds up so well, even today, that the upcoming SUPERMAN RETURNS is supposably a part of this franchise, occurring six years after the events of SUPERMAN II and even features Marlon Brando in the theatrical trailer as the voice of Jor-El.<br />With a $55 million budget (which was enormous for its time) this movie eventually raked in almost $300 million world-wide (which even today stands as a quite respectable take.) In addition it featured a knock-out punch by John Williams who went from scoring JAWS to scoring STAR WARS and then onto SUPERMAN (amazing.)<br />Remastered for its 2001 DVD release this movie is a vast improvement on a master print that had deteriorated to such an extent that some sequences were close to unwatchable. This print is clearer and sharper and corrects some previous color balancing problems. It also has a remastered soundtrack that means it sounds the best it has ever since its original 1978 release.<br />As an added bonus it also features about eight minutes of additional footage that effectively doubles Marlon Brando's screen time with new scenes on Krypton and at the Fortress of Solitude. In addition there's more early Clark Kent and disaster footage. Finally rounding out the new scenes is the reinstated Lex Luthor "Gauntlet of Death" sequence which had previously been seen on network television broadcasts. In stark contrast to the ire that added scenes to the STAR WARS movies has drawn from fans, fans of this series seemed largely welcome to the additions here.<br />Where this DVD really shines however is in the special features, which are impressive. First up is a scene specific commentary by Director Richard Donner and scribe Tom Mankiewicz. After writing the first three James Bond movies of the 1970s Mankiewicz was brought onto SUPERMAN to help with the script, however due to certain legal complications he could nopt be credited for the work he did and so was handed the title of Creative Consultant. This is the kind of commentary that I love, it's screen specific and its light and friendly. It's like having Donner and Mankiewicz hanging out in your living room watching this beloved movie of your childhood with you. They share a number of memories on making the movie and its good to see Mankiewicz get his proper recognition.<br />There's also an isolated score audio track that allows the viewer to marvel at the work of Williams.<br />But there's more. The jewel in the crown special feature is the three documentaries that actually act more as three chapters in one larger feature-length documentary. Before the Indiana Jones trilogy came out with its three-hour behind the scenes feature and before the three-hour "Empire of Dreams" documentary for the STAR WARS trilogy DVD release, we have the behind-the-scenes documentaries here that presented the benchmark by which all future DVD releases were judged.<br />Hosted by Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen) they feature on-camera interviews with Donner, (the late) Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman and Mankiewicz (among others.) They cover such issues as the making of the film, the failed attempts at making a man fly and the unceremonious firing of Donner who had delivered the producers a smash hit and was already over halfway through the shooting of the sequel. Still, Donner had the last laugh when several years later he got to direct all four movies of the phenomenally successful LETHAL WEAPON movies.<br />More a curiosity as anything else is a separate feature on the Superman, Lois Lane, & Ursa screen tests that include five different actresses vying for the part of Lois Lane.<br />The younger audiences that have grown up watching SMALLVILLE on the WB will no doubt be a little confused by this movie that follows a more conventional storyline than the popular Tom Welling series. I'm probably in the minority when it comes to preferring the incredible Erica Durance as Lois Lane, but Margot Kidder does an admirable job here and Gene Hackman is an interesting choice as Lex Luthor.<br />However, where there is no debate is Christopher Reeve. Largely unknown at the time of casting this movie Reeve embodies the part of Clark Kent and was elevated to even more mythic proportions by the courage with which he tackled his unfortunate accident.<br />Starting with the death of Krypton and ending with Superman saving California, this movie (and its sequel) set a good foundation for SUPERMAN RETURNS and this DVD should find a place of honor on the shelf of every self-respecting DVD collector.</p></body></html>

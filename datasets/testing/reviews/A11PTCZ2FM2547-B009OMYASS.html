<meta name="summary" content="Don't Eat the Buffet at this Hostel"></head><body><p>Gotta blame Jim Carrey and Steve Martin.  These dudes' latest box office clunkers were showing at my local theater--leaving HOSTEL the lone remaining alternative inside Theater #1.  I didn't know much about HOSTEL; heck, I didn't know anything about<br /><br />HOSTEL.  But I do like staying in exotic hotels, so what the hey?  I realized this film was produced by Quentin Tarantino, but for all I knew the controversial director/producer could've had a change of creative heart and made a movie about room service and breakfast buffets. Was worth a look, anyway.<br /><br />Well.  HOSTEL, at least at first, was like Comedy Central's "The Man Show" on acid:  three dweebs (two Americans, one Icelander, all unlikeable) traipsing through Europe in pursuit of the ultimate hedonistic high.  The bongs and the broads are plentiful, but our three protagonists (Have I mentioned they're unlikeable?) want more.  They are told of a special hostel in an eastern European country behind the old Soviet Iron Curtain.  They are shown some pics of naked vixens taken via a camera phone--taken allegedly at the hostel of Paradise--and the three guys are on the next train headed east.<br /><br />As predictable as predictability itself, all is not well at the hostel of Paradise, and the three travelers, one by one, fall prey to a meat grinder torture chamber--a warped and demented establishment where patrons from the world over pay exorbitant sums to slice and dice unwilling (and screaming) victims.  One of our three "heroes" manages to catch a break during his fun session and escape (or at least, run around from room to room, from incinerator to parking lot, and back again, and to parking lot again, ad infinitum); the plot then takes on a morbid cat-and-mouse chase, until our "hero" extracts a totally unbelievable and out-of-character pound of vengeance flesh.<br /><br />Writer/director Eli Roth bombards the viewer with blood and wounds and gore galore--yet the carnage looked like something a group of junior high kids would come up with by raiding their folks' freezers and slinging the stuff around.  In fact, the gore very much reminded me of Peter Jackson's early horror offerings (and that's pretty sad).  As another fact, I wasn't sure--by all the nonsensical slipping in pools of blood and split-second amputations and groping for appendages and so on--if Roth was really trying to present a horror flick, or a parody of a horror flick.  And if HOSTEL is a parody, it's a bad parody; if it's a horror movie, it's even worse.<br /><br />But still better than Martin or Carrey.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best of 2005 by FAR! SPOILER FREE!"></head><body><p>Best Foreign movie EVER!<br /><br />Oldboy is a Korean film, obviously made on a very short budget that is nothing short of brilliant. It has been compared to Tarantino movies and may I ask: what's up with that? Sure I enjoy some Tarantino flicks but this has nothing to do with them. The pervasive language label on the back is in all fairness a bunch of b.s. Mr. F is barely used.<br /><br />There isn't that much violence in the movie but when there is, it's intense. The violence is there for a purpose: for example, one scene is a sacrifice and another is vengeance. The one brawl the movie has is great! The protagonist (don't know his name) and his hammer makes these 15 men's lives a living hell.<br /><br />Yet there were very few fights which surprised me. But the ones there are..are great!<br /><br />On the other hand this movie lives off of the ingeniously woven plot. The violence is only a product of that, only used with a purpose. A man, preparing for his daughter's birthday is abducted and thrown in a room. He is framed for the murder of his wife and spends 15 years of his life there. Who did it? Why? This will all be found out in due time. When he is released, he's given a suit and a cell phone where his abductor calls him. He meets a young woman and falls for her. She helps him, shows him love, and helps him get revenge. But things are more complicated than that. And if you want to see a twist, the huge one at the end will knock you flat. It will haunt you and maybe bring tears to your eyes. The "sacrifice" is the true meaning of love, and it shows the good nature of our hero. This hero isn't only a but kicking bad a#$ like Tarantino would have made him out as, no...He is someone who really knows about love and is such a courageous person that he will do anything for that person. And this is what American films lack, a moral. And this twist isn't like the dark crazy ones in Amercan cinema, it is an unusual one, an unexpected one. It's a touching tale, a haunting tale, a sad tale. It will make you think a lot and behind all of this violence and revenge is love and that love is the true meaning behind this ingenious tale.<br /><br />It is hands down the best of 2005 and more than that even!</p></body></html>

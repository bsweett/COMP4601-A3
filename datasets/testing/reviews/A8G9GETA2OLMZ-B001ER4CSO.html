He can take a pretty weak premise (evil character wants to rouse an evil army to take over the world) and transform it into a stunning, in fact moving, story.<br /><br />The characters--usually stereotypes in this kind of movie--have great depth.  The plot clips right along from one surprise to the next, but all seems to hold together, and the sets!  Whoa.  The sets are spectacular.<br /><br />The Extra on the DVD about sets is amazing.<br /><br />Del Toro has both de-emphasized Hellboy in this one, and focused more on Abe Sapien.  The romance between Abe and the Princess grows as Hellboy's with Liz declines (or seems to decline).<br /><br />And Hellboy, in his conflict with his new boss Krauss, in his drunken binge, and his SINGING (!) becomes even more likable.<br /><br />This is great stuff.  I don't think I have ever sat through a Barry Manilow song before without squirming, but in this one I was riveted.<br /><br />Funny, charming, breathless, interesting.</p></body></html>

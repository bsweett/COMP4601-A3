Continue releasing further entries into the series, and risk failure by creating sub-par movies, or quit while ahead and take pride in the fact that you released two successful and original horror films (a feat not easily obtained in today's modern movie age).  Plus the fact that both current installments were highly entertaining supernatural/horror thrillers that managed to avoid the clich&eacute;d pitfalls of most horror films, which led me to believe that New Line Cinema was playing things smarter with this series.  However, the appeal of strong box office returns always outweighs executive's better judgment in such matters.  When it was announced that "Final Destination 3" was being made, I was highly doubtful of the film being all that good, but I thought the same about the second movie and I was proven way wrong on that count.  So, I kept an open mind and awaited the release of the trailer to fill me in on the story for the third movie, and once the preview finished, I was fairly certain that this movie was not going to be as good as its predecessors.  But, I thought, since I had already seen the first two in the series and they were entertaining, I may as well see this one.  Of course I waited for DVD, I wasn't about to go pay 7.00 dollars to watch this movie, especially with an increasingly strong probability that it wouldn't be all that good.<br /><br />"Final Destination 3" begins with a group of teenagers preparing for graduation and their lives beyond high school.  In this group you have, the bad boy, the popular girl, the hot chick(s), the outcast, and the jock, this group comprises your basic horror movie cast.  During a graduation celebration, the outcast named Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), has a vision of the roller coaster her and the rest of the group are preparing to ride crashing and killing all onboard.  Upon waking up from her vision, Wendy freaks out getting herself removed from the ride along with several others in the group and within moments of Wendy being removed the ride begins and all the events she had just witnessed in her vision come true.  All the people on board the ride, including a couple of her friends, are killed.  Wendy's prophetic episode prompts the bad boy of the group (Ryan Merriman) to do some research, and he discovers that she's not the first to have these visions, but also if history continues to repeat itself that all who got off the ride are still in danger as Death is looking to finish off what it began that dark night.<br /><br />So, how does a movie studio continue to churn out hit after hit within a movie franchise without leaving the audience feeling like they've seen it all before?  And when will they learn that a franchise has reached its peak, and they should quit while ahead?  For some franchises there may never be enough, for there is always a new way to reinvigorate the franchise; "Batman Begins" and "007: Casino Royale" would be prime examples.  But other franchises, primarily those of the horror genre, tend to overstay their welcome long after their franchise has peaked, and therefore fail to achieve hit after hit.  But that doesn't necessarily stop the studios from trying to find that special something to achieve box office gold yet again with a single series.  Examples for franchises that overstayed their welcome would be `Halloween', `Friday the 13th', and `A Nightmare on Elm Street'.  Sometimes movie studios know how to keep a good thing going for as long as they can, and then they know when to cut it off, so that profits won't taper off.  Dimension Films found huge success with their highly successful `Scream' trilogy, they also knew that past "Scream 3", the franchise would be entering that `overstayed welcome' territory, and that was a risk they didn't want to take.  So, have the powers-that-be at New Line Cinema managed to release another entertaining and profitable installment into a franchise or have they overstayed their welcome?<br /><br />Well, the answer is a mixture of both.  "Final Destination 3" was an entertaining chapter in the series, hopefully a final chapter, because though the movie was fun and kept my attention throughout, it made me feel a little too much of  `been there, done that'.  The characters were your typical horror cast of characters as I pointed out above, and the story felt a little too much like a rehash of the story from the first film, making the movie seem unoriginal for a franchise that had succeeded in being original.  Even though I have my gripes about this third chapter in the `Final Destination' series, I still liked it, though not as much as the first two.  The death scenes were inventive and original enough, without being over-the-top and gory.  The cast was fairly solid, the movie could have definitely benefited from a veteran actor or two.  It was nice to see that the series remembers its roots and references events from the first two films to link the proceedings together, but this also served as a reminder as to how unoriginal this installment was.  The biggest problem "Final Destination 3" had, aside from lack of originality (which was bound to happen in a series like this), was that New Line didn't appear to try as hard with this movie, and the story proceeded along in a rather predictable manner.  With all that being said, the movie as I stated earlier in the paragraph, was still entertaining, and would serve as a decent ending to the franchise.  Because, in my opinion, any further entries would be an example of overstaying one's welcome, and I hope New Line is smart enough to figure that out.<br /><br />"Final Destination 3" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.</p></body></html>

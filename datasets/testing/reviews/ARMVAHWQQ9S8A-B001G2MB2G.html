This film condenses the essentials of the storyarc into one of the most powerful cinematic experiences I've had.<br /><br />From the opening sequence, I knew that this would be the best movie of the series. And it is. By far. From the outstandingly ballsy cinematography to the acting (it's like night and day between this movie and "Goblet of Fire", which was great in it's own right but can't touch this), from the witty and quirky script to the special effects, it's clear that director David Yates single handedly whipped the Harry Potter movie franchise into shape. While movies 1-4 were great, they were like unpolished stones; at points they tried so hard to go along with the books and at others tried so hard to separate themselves from the books (think "Prisoner of Azkaban"'s shrunken heads), but this movie--"Order of the Phoenix"--knows what it is. It is a film, and it makes sense as a film. Everything you need to know to understand the film is here, and--unlike "Goblet of Fire"--you won't need a previous understanding of the books or even the other movies. Certainly fans will complain about deviance from the book, but these are the same unreasonable people that wish the movies would be twenty-four hours long so they could squeeze in every line of dialogue. "Order of the Phoenix" is how a book should be adapted.<br /><br />Every actor, from Daniel Radcliffe to Emma Watson to the kid who plays Dudley, is at the tippy top of their game. They're playing young adults and they act it; they laugh, and they cry. This is the first time that I actually totally suspended my disbelief while watching a Potter film, and that was almost all due to the superb acting.<br /><br />I did expect a bit more from the climax (the important character death was kind of wiggy) but things get roaring back into shape for a perfect duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Following that, everything touched on in the movie wraps up beautifully. No threads are left untied, and no plot left with an open end. Very, very satisfying. Oh, and if that isn't enough, this should be: Evanna Lynch is spine-tinglingly good as Luna Lovegood.<br /><br />It may not be what you expected, it may not be what you thought you wanted... But for me, it was more on both counts.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></body></html>

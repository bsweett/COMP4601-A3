<meta name="summary" content="Can a movie be just as bad as the book it's based on? Yes, it can."></head><body><p>NOTE: This review contains major spoilers<br /><br />Seeing as how the original novel by Christopher Paolini is the worst novel I have ever read (for now), I became curious as how the movie adaptation fared out. Critics panned the movie for obviously being a LOTR/Star Wars ripoff, and audiences disliked it for being unfaithful to the source material. Despite all the criticisms, however, I saw the movie, anyway. Now, I've seen some really bad films in my life, such as Battlefield Earth, The Hot Chick, Chicken Little, and so forth. "Eragon" is.....well, I wouldn't necessarily say that it's worse than the movies I've just mentioned, but I'll explain.<br /><br />First, I will say the film does have some nice scenery and a couple of decent special effects shots (the flight sequence, for example). But it all ends there as the rest of the movie fails to achieve greatness in many ways. The story, much like the book, is heavily borrowed from Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and even The Wheel of Time (The Spine, anyone?). While the movie is notably different from the book, you can still spot the clich&eacute;s from beginning to end. I mentioned in my written review for the original novel that the author basically recycles one of the oldest fantasy formulas ever known (average villager leaves home, goes on a quest, delves into his family history, becomes a great warrior, etc.) and adds nothing that's new to the genre. Well, the evidence in the movie is still strong if you observe closely. The mentor trains our main hero to become a great swordsman, that's a clich&eacute;. The mean heroine is pretty much a damsel in distress, that's another clich&eacute;. Our main hero is revealed to be the Chosen One, that's the most obvious clich&eacute;. You know, I find it interesting that in many fantasy stories, there's just one person who is destined to restore peace and destroy evil forever. Why not a trio of heroes, or a quintet? Well, anyway, the plot is pretty much riddled with clich&eacute;s, and adds nothing new to the fantasy genre. The movie itself is basically one of the most simplistic fantasy films ever created. And you might argue that this is just a family film. Well, families aren't stupid.<br /><br />And if you think the story is bad, you haven't examined the character of Eragon (Ed Speleers). One of the biggest problems I had with the book was the main character: his personality was disorganized, and his chemistry with the other characters were very awkward (Arya, for example). Nothing is changed. The Eragon that we see in the film is the same handsome boy who embraces the same exaggerated nobility and becomes the same savior of the human race. The arrogance in the character is also shown in the middle of the film when he confronts Brom (Jeremy Irons); he acts like a grownup before and after he realizes that Brom used to be a dragon rider himself. In fact, the entire race of the Varden seems hopeless until Eragon enters the picture. In addition, I've noticed that Eragon's clothes are remarkably clean for a villager. When he's living in Carvahall, his clothes look like they come from a prince compared to everyone else. Did he just buy his own washing machine or something? So basically, there are many things wrong about this character. I mean, here's a kid who enters a fort to save Arya (Sienna Guillory), and no one is aware that he is about to rescue one of their own prisoners. The guards must be idiots. And what's worse, he doesn't even get hurt when he escapes. Not a scratch. The guards must REALLY be idiots. And Durza (Robert Carlyle), one of the main antagonists in the story, can't even break this kid's finger. HE must be an idiot. And Brom is the only one who is fatally injured. He's.....pretty lucky to be killed off in a movie like this. To be quite honest, Eragon is one of the oddest characters I have ever seen in a movie. This so-called average villager finds a blue-colored egg in the woods and he is not the least bit shocked that it hatches and out pops a baby dragon. He just smiles. Like an idiot. He's an idiot. Then, he has high hopes for becoming a dragon rider, and yet he doesn't think of the dangers that he would face. Can't he just pose for GQ or something? And THEN, he wants to rescue Arya, and he thinks that he can take on dozens of people with only a sword and a limited use of magic. The guards are still idiots, but not as idiotic as Eragon.<br /><br />And do they really expect us to believe that Eragon can learn to become a dragon rider in such a short time? And learn a different language in such a short time? And fall in love with an unknown elf who looks old enough to be his mother?<br /><br />Incredible.<br /><br />But we're not going to stop there. There are other things about this movie that can make you lose your appetite.  The dialogue is cheesy and poorly written. The music is horribly overblown. John Malkovitch as Galbatorix is an embarrassment, complete with a terrible attempt at a foreign accent. Ed Speleers as Eragon is a terrible bore, and he isn't trying hard enough to actually act (granted, this IS his first starring role in a movie, so I guess that's the reason why). Rachael Weisz's voice is inappropriate for Saphira as her lightweight tone doesn't mix with the character's strong-minded personality. The sexual innuendo is pretty obvious (this is rated PG, right?). The special effects are bland; nothing special comes out of it. The action scenes are dull. What have I left out? Oh yes, a few scenes are unintentionally goofy, so don't eat or drink anything while you're watching this movie.<br /><br />Reading the novel was a dismal experience. Watching the movie was a dismal experience. Knowing that Hollywood actually had the guts to adapt the novel into a movie was a DISMALLY dismal experience. "Eragon" is basically a silly, simplistic, clich&eacute;d, badly written, badly directed, badly acted, and badly pretentious fantasy film that doesn't deserve the $250 million that it earned at the box office. It's one of those movies that just don't work. Babies, kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, and humans in general deserve better than this.<br /><br />Grade: F</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Small Minds Beware"></head><body><p>Small minded people will not like this instant classic. Shot backwards in time this movie will really befuddle and confuse those of us who cannot grasp anything past Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sixteen Candles. Guy Pierce is a shooting star in this business. The story is new, interesting and compelling. Its like putting together a puzzle. GREAT FLICK! GREAT CONCEPT!</p></body></html>

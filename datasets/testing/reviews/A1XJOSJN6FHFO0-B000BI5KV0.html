In this movie you will see the survival in the worse conditions of the Penquin, but it is more than that.  It is the story that is proof positive that creatures, other than humans, work together, love together, mourn together and lean on each other to survive. Through this movie you will be moved with a myraid of emotions from a giggle, to deep sadness, from horror to total respect. It is a raw look at the life style of yet another one of God's creatures and one you will not soon forget.<br /><br />I watched it with my grandchildren and we laughed and cried together. In it they saw life and they saw death; they saw  the importance of committment and love  for survival, the workings of a family unit in the wild and most important that creatures are not just dumb animals. Exceptional and well worth your viewing time.</p></body></html>

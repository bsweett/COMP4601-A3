<meta name="summary" content="Amusingly Hostile Remake Illustrates the Epitome of Marriage Trouble..."></head><body><p>Some 60 years after Hitchcock made the marriage troubled screwball comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 1941 with Carole Lombard in the female lead and Robert Montgomery opposite her the film has received an action-packed makeover.  This remake casts Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt as Jane and John Smith.  The film certainly gives the audience a fireworks spectacle comparable to many Schwarzenegger and Stallone films from the 1980s and early 1990s.  It even has a touch of James Bond and Mission Impossible with its secret compartments and its cool approach to the hush-hush missions.  However, the remake still possesses some of the same screwball humor, as the new Smiths struggle with their marriage.<br /><br />There are both similarities and differences in both the original and the remake.  The original opens in a messy hotel room to which the arguing couple has withdrawn to deal with their relationship issues while the 2005 version delivers a more contemporary solution through a visit to a marriage counselor.  Hitchcock applies a detailed mise-en-scene and terrific performances by the cast to accentuate the character's lives while Jane and John offer information on their relationship through brief verbal testimonials.  However, the most obvious difference is the subtlety of threats in Hitchcock's film while director Doug Liman is much rougher (maybe a clear underestimation) in his depiction of a marriage in trouble.<br /><br />It is in the presentation where the remake highlights the differences with the original film, as both Jane and John live secret double lives.  They are professional killers that serve the highest bidder.  Successfully, they have hidden their secrets from each other for the last five-six years (they do not seem to be able agree on how long they have been married.)  This is also the second time that the theme of a couple having secret double lives emerge, which it also done in James Cameron's 1994 box office hit True Lies.  However, the difference here is that both are secret killers.<br /><br />Jane and John are constantly watching over their shoulder in order to maintain the normal front of marriage.  Often they come close to uncovering one another, but never do. It did not start this way between them, as they once were happily in love.  Over time, their never-ending series of intricate lies and deceits has begun to wear on them.  The weariness has worn out their lustful desire and loving appetite for each other's lips and created an indifference.  Despite their apathy, they both try to maintain the illusion of happiness by doing the things married people do such as eating supper together and going to dinner parties.  The apathy also forges a strong silence between them, which never seems to be broken through any kind of quarrel.  Still, these emotions must surface in order for the relationship to continue, as Hitchcock so well portrayed through his 1941 version.<br /><br />The truth is about to come out when they both take on a job of assassinating the same person.  The question only is how it will affect their relationship, as they both carry years of repressed resentment.  It is a strong bitterness that will affect their reaction to the truth of their identities and fake foundation of their marriage.  Also, they realize that they are competitors living together, and the awareness of one another might just have lethal consequences and bring a love quarrel to another level disguised in blades and bullets.<br /><br />Married couples always encounter some moments in their lives when their relationship might seem weakened.  Some successfully survive the rough spots while others seek divorce.  Jane and John will propel the thought of splitting up into an entertaining action film that will have the audience laugh and rock in their seats, as the characters of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie seek the ultimate ending of a relationship.  In addition, Liman has previously made the witty Swingers (1996), exciting Go (1999), and the suspenseful Bourne Identity (2002) and shows in Mr. & Mrs. Smith his eye for thoughtful and quick action, which displays much promise for future films.  Unfortunately even though the film is amusing and has some flashy action sequences that will draw attention, it never reaches the innovative quality of Hitchcock.</p></body></html>

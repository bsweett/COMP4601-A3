<meta name="summary" content="Story fabricated on an actual act of terrorism"></head><body><p>This movie is inspired by real events, but is a work of fiction. From the book Vengeance and history we only know that terrorists killed the Israel Olympians in Munich and the people who were claimed to be associated with Black September were later killed.<br /><br />In this movie Spielberg weaves a story around those two basic facts that give us an intense story line of the secret Israeli squad assigned to track down and assassinate all eleven Palestinians to have planned the 1972 Munich massacre of eleven Israeli athletes. The director seems to focus on the personal toll this mission of revenge takes on the team and the man who led it.<br /><br />My brother had worked as a volunteer at those Olympics so we were close to the tragedy. And it was a horrible tragedy. But knowing of the Mossad, I doubt this is realistic. Also I doubt their chosen agents would be this incompetent. And the sex scenes in the movie serve no purpose as is stated elsewhere. Other then that it is an OK action film. The topic of terrorism and retaliation is as relevant today as it was in 1972.</p></body></html>

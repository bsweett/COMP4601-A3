Blu ray review!"></head><body><p>And my job is to tell you what a great movie this is, and how eye poppingly wow the blu-ray is! A wonderful horror-adventure story paying homage to the universal monster movie classics! Hugh Jackman is fantastic in the lead role as Van Helsing and the rest of the cast make this a fun watch. Plenty of tongue and cheek moments but the action and scares will make you jump too. Completely enjoyable.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: For those of you who own the ultimate edition this blu-ray version comes with all the extras except for the original universal monster movies (Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolfman). If you want those I suggest picking up the special editions on DVD. As for the look and sound of this movie...WOW!!! DEMO DISC!!! SHOW THIS TO YOUR FRIENDS!!! ABSOLUTELY WORTHY TO UPGRADE!!!</p></body></html>

Hanz Zimmer's score was nominated for a Golden Globe award.  Ron Howard won his Best Director Oscar for "A Beautiful Mind" in 2001.  I thought he did an excellent job of keeping the pacing moving and the unexpected plot turns popping up with regularity.  I greatly appreciated the look of the film and the stunning locations.<br /><br />The most amazing performance in the film for me is Paul Bettany as Silas.  The intensity and level of commitment he brings to the role is breathtaking.  As the cold-blooded killer who breaks the ten commandments as a service to God and flagellates himself as punishment, Bettany takes the performance over the top.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou charmed me in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640VO">Amelie</a> for which she received a Best Actress nomination from the French Academy of Cinema in 2001.  She demonstrates range from that film to this by playing Sophie Neveu with a tightly controlled performance.<br /><br />Tom Hanks won back-to-back Oscars in 1993 & 1994 for "Philadelphia" & "Forrest Gump" and was nominated for "Saving Private Ryan" in 1998 and for "Cast Away" in 2000.  As Robert Langdon, he gives a thoughtful performance, playing a character who is cerebral.  Howard gives him quite a bit of screen time as we watch him think.  It's interesting, but short of gripping.<br /><br />Ian McKellan was twice Oscar-nominated for Best Actor for "Gods & Monsters" in 1998 and in the supporting role in "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" in 2001.  As Sir Leigh Teabring, he almost makes me forget X-men with a strong performance as the wealthy man who enjoys pulling the strings.<br /><br />Other performances are also of note.  Alfred Molina from "Chocolat" in 2000 and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002C9D9U">Luther</a> in 2003 plays Bishop Aringarosa who comes across as a heavy (pun intended) fanatic who is willing to break commandments for religious political expediency.  Jurgen Prochnow from "Das Boot" (1981), "The English Patient" (1996), & "Air Force One" (1997) performs well as the bank manager Vernet who also wants to own the secrets in Neveu's account.  Jean Reno who I loved in the 1994 film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767802519">The Professional</a> and enjoyed in "The Pink Panther (2006) plays Captain Bezu Fache, the police chief who works to solve the crime.  Jean-Yves Borteloot plays Teabring's chauffeur Remy Jean and is given a free reign by Ron Howard to excellent result.  Marie-Francoise Audollent does a nice cameo as Sister Sandrine who runs into Brother Silas.<br /><br />Dan Brown's book has of course created controversy, particularly from those unable to distinguish fiction from real life or those whose weak faith results in defensiveness about their religion.  The magnificent teachings and life of Jesus of Nazareth cannot be threatened by this fictional film anymore than the Taj Mahal could be threatened by a fly.  As a film, this works well, entertaining with repeated viewings.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

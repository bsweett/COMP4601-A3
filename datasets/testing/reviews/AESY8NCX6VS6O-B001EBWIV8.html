<meta name="summary" content="Has its moments, but overall terribly disappointing..."></head><body><p>I believe with all my film-lover's heart that "The Matrix" is one of the finest sci-fi films ever made, if not arguably one of the greatest MOVIES ever made. Now, let's talk about "The Matrix: Reloaded", which is, in short, an ENORMOUS disappointment in the context of the potential of the series. "Reloaded" has one huge problem with it - it takes itself WAY too seriously. The first film wasn't afraid to happily wallow in its hokey dialogue and cheesy plot, but this one simply loses the charm of the first film and actually tries to be something more than it is. Yes, the fight scenes are great (though some commit the sin of overkill - a nearly 15-minute car chase just loses something after 10 minutes), the effects are great, and it stays visually true to the first film, but the movie gets lost in its own philosophy, not to mention indulgence. The huge "orgy" scene has few rivals when it comes to "Most Pointless Scene Of All Time." Sure, the Wachowski's were trying to show that the people were becoming part of a community, but those points could have been made in a more subtle, relevant manner. I do admire at points the times when they do try to add emotional depth to the film, with Morpheus's relationship and the growing bond between Neo and Trinity, but it just doesn't work in the context of the film. Whatever happened to being a good old-fashioned sci-fi movie? I love a comment from a critic at Entertainment Weekly that said, paraphrased, if Neo ordered food from McDonald's, he would (in this film) most likely launch into a deep spiritual battle over whether he was destined to super-size that or not. It totally captures the overdone nature of the film. All in all, the movie just doesn't know when to stop. Sure, they need to keep the plot going, but if it means putting out subpar offerings like "Reloaded," maybe they should have just left "The Matrix" as a movie and not a whole trilogy.</p></body></html>

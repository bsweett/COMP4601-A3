<meta name="summary" content="I'm the guy you buy...."></head><body><p>"...not the guy you kill!"<br /><br />This is a fine and tense thriller concerning power and corruption in high places and the moral and ethical no-man's-land to be found in powerful corporations and law firms where ungodly amounts of money are in play and the overwhelming tension caused by the these high stakes can subborn and compromise otherwise decent people.<br /><br />It's a tough game these people play and this taut film wastes no time as it plunges right into the middle of the world the eponymous hero inhabits. Michael Clayton, a one time NY Asst.DA, now a fulltime "fixer" for a powerful corporate law firm, is a man whose string is played out in every area of his life.  Nicely done by Clooney, Clayton is running on empty just about the time he is asked to clean up the biggest mess imaginable.  A collegue and friend, lead defense litigator in a $3 billion class action suit has apparently flipped-out and gone "off the reservation" and Clayton, the Janitor, has to pull it all back together again.  And then, it gets nasty.<br /><br />Written and directed by Tony Gilroy with some of the same energy and tension he brought to his scripts for the Bourne trilogy, this is first-rate popular entertainment, brought with intelligence and wit, as we experience the rarified atmosphere of the rich and powerful we see not dissimilar people where villainy can have a recognizable face and a human dimension.  Well done by a superb cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Tilde Swinton and Sydney Pollack, Gilroy has acquitted himself admirably.</p></body></html>

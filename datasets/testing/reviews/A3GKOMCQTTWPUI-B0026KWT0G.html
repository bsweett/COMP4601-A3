<meta name="summary" content="Friday the 13th Part 3"></head><body><p>Gather around, young children, for I have a tale to impart. It is of a young boy with a severe Oedipal complex who lived on Crystal Lake. The days of peaceful skinny-dipping and sweet young love are gone. Jason's mom has died at the hands of some buxom girl, and Jason is out for teenage blood. Please don't look behind the hockey mask, for it is horrifying. He is scarred, nearly mutated. He seems to possess super-powers because he is incapable of dying. Accept your destiny because he will always come back. Forget about slicing and dicing this once-kind lad. He is indestructible. Run for your life. No, don't go into the woods and down the road. That would make too much sense. Lock yourself in the house. Stand still. Breathe and wait to die.<br /><br />There you have it my dear on-lookers. This is the story of Friday the 13th Part 3, the same story as in just about all the sequels to Friday the 13th, except this time Jason goes to New York City. Since I was six years old when this film came out, my parents had little interest in taking me to this film. This is unfortunate because I will never get the chance to relish what might have been pretty nifty 3D effects<br /><br />The film was shot in 3D and looks pretty bland on video or DVD. A kid is about to swing a bat and it is strangely positioned near the filmmaker's camera lens. Ditto for a variety of other objects like a rope, a yo-yo, and a spear entering the eye of a Hispanic girl who only carries food stamps in her wallet. Without the ability to experience the 3D aspect, all that remains are gratuitous shot compositions.<br /><br />Watching this film is an unbearable experience because it rehashes the original's formula. There is no spontaneity, just by-the-numbers killings surrounded by crude filler material. The audience is aware that the purpose of the film is to see Jason kill a couple of a teenagers, with one teenager (two, if you're lucky) surviving at the film's end. There is no need to hear couples talk about sex and relationships because the material serves no lasting purpose. Our emotional attachment is to Jason's slings and arrows.<br /><br />Director Steve Miner gets credit for the camp element, though. It's delightful hearing characters say such things as "you put this barrier between us and I want to break through" or "nothing is going to happen if we're all here together." He seems to have fun with the idea of the teenager in peril and he flies with it. But all of this is ultimately irrelevant because the film is not particularly scary. An opening flashback reminds us of the events that transpired in the first two films causing us to expect more of the same. Teenagers will dress like Pat Benatar and smoke as much pot as they want and when they take off their clothes, heads will fly.</p></body></html>

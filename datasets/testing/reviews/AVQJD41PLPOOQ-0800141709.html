I will however, take the opportunity to test my memory in "public" with perhaps my favorite sequence in the entire film...<br /><br />"Hello?  Uh, hello, Dimitri?  Listen, can't hear too well.  Do you suppose you could turn the music down just a little?  Ah, that's better.  Yes, I can hear you now, Dimitri.  Clear and plain and coming through fine.  I'm coming through fine, too, ayy?  Well then, like you say, it's good that I'm fine and you're fine.  I agree with you, it great to be fine.  Ha, ha, ha,ha.  Now then, Dimitri, you know, how, we've always talked about the possibility...of something going wrong with the bomb.  The bomb, Dimitri.  The hydrogen bomb.  Well, what happened was, one of our base commanders, he went; well, he went a little funny in the head.  You know, just a little...funny; and he went and did a silly thing.  Well, I'll tell you what he did; he ordered our planes...to attack your country.  Well, let me finish, Dimitri.  Let me finish, Dimitri.  Listen, how do you think I feel about this?  Can you imagine how I feel about this, Dimitri?  Why do you think I'm calling you?  Just to say hello?  Oh course I like to speak to you!  Of course I like to say hello!  Not now, but anytime, Dimitri.  I'm just calling to tell you something terrible...it's a friendly call, of course it's a friendly call.  Listen, if it wasn't friendly...you probably wouldn't have gotten it."<br /><br />Whew!  I could go on and on, but it gets exhausting!  Love, love, love this movie!<br /><br />Miss you, Stanley.</p></body></html>

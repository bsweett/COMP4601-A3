<meta name="summary" content="a quite unique sci-fi movie"></head><body><p>but like robert dinero?, mcgregor should do something quick about his several huge moles on his face, better remove them sooner than later. why? because i could not help focusing on those moles every time when i watch him played some good roles. he's a very talented actor, if he could remove his facial moles so far, he might be even greater if he could do some facial improvement. this movie has the most uptodate cinematographical achievements and progress in the movie industry and you would be amazed how computer could do in a futuristic movie. this movie makes a lot of other old sci-fi movies look so outdated if you re-watch them after you have watched this one. the screenplay is not quite up to the standard of the technique shown in this movie.</p></body></html>

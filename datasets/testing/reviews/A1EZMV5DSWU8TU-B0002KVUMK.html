<meta name="summary" content="Action-adventure, not horror"></head><body><p>Into the macabre world of classic horror monsters brought back to life in this quaint film, where, not since Mad Monster Party, the three primary icons in Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankentein's Monster reunite - here to do battle in a rather ingenious plot wherein Dracula desires to bring his progeny life, but needs Frankenstein to complete the experiment.<br /><br />In the beginning, Mr. Hyde makes an impressive cameo appearence, although this seemed a bit unecessary, and could have been saved for a subsequent film, along with perhaps The Mummy - even with the other monsters for that metter. Unfortunatey, the characters in this depiction are rather one-dimensional, and the scenes move by much too quickly - the overall impression of this presentation seems more like an action-adventure fight movie, rather than a horror film, so the true fear element is absent here, but is fun nonetheless.<br /><br />I enjoyed the impressive aesthetics of The Wolfman, done to perfection in My opinion, although Count Dracula could have been better cast, but the brides are exquisite in their beauty and ferocity.  I thought it adorable when the "draclings" were released from their cocoons, flying down to feed upon the villagers below. Frankenstein is a tormented creature here, inspiring pathos in his apparent selfless nature and terrible desolation.<br /><br />Van Helsing himself is presented in a more contemporary manner, wielding remarkable weaponry, particularly the rotary crossbow and the shiroken-like blades. He is commissioned by The Vatican to purge these 'evils' from the world, and during his travel to Transylvania, meets with a gorgeous brunette warrior-princess, who joins him in his quest, whose brother just happens to be the wolfman. Eventually, Van Helsing is infected by The Werewolf curse, that proves to be a key ingredient in his battle with the demonic Dracula. I did like that idea - that The Count tranforms into a magnificent Vampire-Demon  - a decided improvement on his humanoid counterpart.<br /><br />CGI effects abound here {sometimes too much}, the soundtrack is pretty good, and the credits are actually quite creative as well.</p></body></html>

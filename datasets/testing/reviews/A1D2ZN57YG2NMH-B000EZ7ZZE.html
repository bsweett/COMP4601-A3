"Resident Evil: Apocalypse" takes the viewer straight to the world of the "Resident Evil" video games... and it's a TON of fun. Picking up exactly where the first film left off, "Apocalypse" once again puts the viewer in to the extremely competent shoes of our protagonist/heroine: Alice. This time, Alice is a genetically engineered killing machine who makes it her lot in life to kill as many zombies as possible using motorcycles, automatic weapons and even her own fists. From the start, the film takes off at a break-neck pace and simply doesn't let up through it's concise 94 minutes. Many character are added throughout the film (some great, some... not) but if there's one thing this film IS, it's vintage "Resident Evil."</p></body></html>

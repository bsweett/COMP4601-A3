<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Sci-Fi Thriller!"></head><body><p>The Terminator is likely one of the most widely screened movies of the last twenty years. In many ways its effects on popular consciousness have been notable, and it also made a major star of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who up to that point had appeared only in supporting roles in minor films like "Stay Hungry" with Jeff Bridges and "The Villain" with an aging Kirk Douglas.  With the release of this film, all that was over in a heartbeat. Or perhaps one could say, in the speed of a laser beam. For this is a science fiction thriller to end all thrillers! <p>The movie staggers the viewer with the horrifying vision of a world at risk, of a world we can recognize in the act of propelling itself toward a nightmare future, a future that may well be dominated by impersonal and anti-human machines. Linda Hamilton plays the hapless, disorganized, and playfully immature Sarah Connor, future legendary mother to John Connor, the future potential leader of the Anti-machine rebellion that might just save the world in that future time.  And while poor Sarah is trying to wrap her mind around all this data being hurled at her by a solitary soldier sent back in time through a time machine by her son to warn her, a cybernetic warrior is systematically hunting and killing every other Sarah Connor in the Los Angeles county telephone book! <p>This sets the stage for non-stop, heart-wrenching action, and the viewer is assaulted by both sights and data that intrigue and astound him or her, for this is science fiction very well done, a story that has meat and bones over its substantial interior, and like the cyborg that Arnold plays, is ready to slay you into submission.  The scenes don't follow each other so much as get exploded from one sequence to the next, in a blood-curdling, shotgun wielding struggle to kill or be killed. And the struggle goes on and on. This is a classic thriller, folks, one that has already spawned another hit movie (T-2), and rumor now has it that Schwarzenegger and company have T-3 ready to begin production soon. In the unlikely event you have been off the planet and have missed seeing it to date, no problem. Just grab this, some popcorn, and a box of Jujifruits.  The show is about to begin!</p></body></html>

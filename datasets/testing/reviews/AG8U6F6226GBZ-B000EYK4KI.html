<meta name="summary" content="Boring and silly"></head><body><p>I knew little about the film when it came on TV.  Naturally, I heard about Pitt and Jolie.  Who hasn't?  He left his lovely wife for a new cutie that he met while making this movie.  Both actors were boring and so was the script.  I thought I'd seen it all, but this one takes the cake.  The plot (what plot?) was a disaster.  You think, at first, they are just an average rich couple bored with each other and marriage.  And why not?  They barely talk to each other!  But soon you realize that this couple are each secret assassins married to each other, but neither one knows what the other does, despite the fact that all the high tech assassin stuff is hidden all over the house, in the oven, in the garage, under the kitchen cabinets, the microwave, the cutlery drawer, and anywhere a movie director and a computer geek can think of to hide it.<br /><br />These assassins are very, VERY  high tech.  (All of Jolie's associates are very sexy women)  In one scene Jolie escapes like a scene from Spider Man, where she slides down a very tall building on a thin little cord.  At that point, I nearly turned it off.<br /><br />Finally the two discover the profession of the other, and that they are working for two different organizations.  What kind?  We don't know.  Organizations that murder people, whoever they're supposed to be.  Then they get an assignment in which they are both going after the same person (but it's not too clear, why).  Never is.  Anyway, on this mission they spot each other on opposite sides, so they figure out that each of them is in the same business.  At first they decide to kill each other, and at that point it becomes totally ridiculous as they chase each other around the house and down the road.<br /><br />While preparing for the End Time, a few kids come up to Pitt and ask "What are you doing?"  Answer:  "Uh, preparing for a block party."  (or something like that. Don't remember.)<br /><br />At some point, the two change their minds about killing each other and from there the movie is just a jazzed up chase film.  I don't know how it ends, because at that point, I turned it off, and my husband had already fallen asleep.<br /><br />Personally I think films that resemble Spider Man or Batman should remain cartoons.  That's what they were meant to be.  I like a film with a good plot, good acting and as little high tech movie nonsense as possible.</p></body></html>

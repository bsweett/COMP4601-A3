Even though it is not 100% Biblically accurate, I felt that the Bible's message was represented accurately, and it does seem to follow Biblical prophecy very well. My favorite thing about the film is the ending, where Jesus returns &quot;not as a child, but as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.&quot; Sam Neill played Damien Thorne with scary realism and exciting presence. The only thing that could've been kept out was the sex scene (even though it's not as bad as the scenes in HIGHLANDER: THE FINAL DIMENSION and HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME). For anyone and everyone interested in Bible prophecy and exciting conflict. Grade: A+</p></body></html>

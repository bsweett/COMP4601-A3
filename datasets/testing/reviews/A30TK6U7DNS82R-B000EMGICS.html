You can see the cracks in the plot open up like chasms after an earthquake, and whole storylines just get lost forever.  One director after another tried fixing up the results, it must have been enormously expensive, and finally they brought in Rob Reiner to polish it all up.  Wonder why poor Kathy Bates, in a honey blonde wig, had only one scene to play?  I forget what her name is in the movie, but whatever it is she's playing "Exposition."  It's up to her to shoulder the whole burden of the back story, including keeping the treasured high school yearbooks from the 1950s.<br /><br />The scenarists had also to backdate the storyline by ten or twelve years, so that in the present day, it's 1990 or 1992--the early days of the coming internet revolution.  (And yet all the actors have the hairstyles and outfits of today.)  Why?  because otherwise the plot would have Jennifer Aniston playing a woman of 40 or so, and that just wouldn't have been very cute for poor Jennifer.  Because she was supposed to be the daughter born to the real life originals of the "Elaine" and "Benjamin" characters in THE GRADUATE, forever fixed as a mid-sixties book and movie.  It's like a giant jack inserted underneath a flat tire of a movie, this shift back to an earlier time, and yet still there's remnants of a plot in which Jennifer Aniston accidentally pockets Mark Ruffalo's cell phone.<br /><br />Didn't you think she was going to find, like Brittany Murphy in LITTLE BLACK BOOK, that her innocent good boy boyfriend had a secret life, a whole cell phone filled with other women's numbers?<br /><br />Well, she did in an earlier avatar of the script.  Then LITTLE BLACK BOOK came out and the producers realized they would have to change everything, so forget about the portable phone subplot.<br /><br />Then they must have thought that Nellie McKay was going to be the next big thing, not realizing that everyone, even Nellie McKay's mom and dad, eventually has a saturation point beyond which they beg, "Please, not another Nellie McKay song on the soundtrack!"<br /><br />The creepy dead ghost father from SIX FEET UNDER plays Jennifer Aniston's father in this one.  Originally, the script had the Aniston character confronting her mother, but Aniston has real life mother problems, so they had the mother die fourteen years before the story begins, a giant hole in the movie that all the Steel Magnolia shenanigans of Shirley MacLaine and Kathy Bates don't begin to fill.</p></body></html>

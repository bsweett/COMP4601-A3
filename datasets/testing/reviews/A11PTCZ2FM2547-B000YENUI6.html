<meta name="summary" content="Powerful, Yet Disturbing"></head><body><p>I figure Aragorn would come storming down out of the pinnacle of Minas Tirith if he knew Viggo Mortensen made a movie like EASTERN PROMISES.  Tolkienesque this dark film definitely is not.  Yet Mortensen definitely impressed me playing a "driver" for a Russian mob family in urban London.  From his stoic, almost inhumane demeanor, to his extremely convincing Russian accent, this actor shows some serious range.<br /><br />Translating the Russian diary of a dead young mother who just gave birth to an infant girl is the catalyst to this powerful, yet disturbing, story.  The midwife caring for the baby (Naomi Watts) is looking for answers to the mother's past; her search brings her inside the Russian mob, to a family led by a soft-spoken, yet very calculating, patriarch (Armin Mueller-Stahl).  Mortensen is one of the family's enforcers, a man whose tattooed body tells the story of his life in Russian prisons--a man who must keep tabs on the patriarch's hot-tempered, hard-drinking son (Vincent Cassel is fabulous); yet as the story progresses, a special bond develops between the midwife and the enforcer.  The movie builds to a rigorous climax, and when it arrives, the gratuitous violence takes over.  (The bath house scene, where we get to see more of Viggo than we ever wanted, while grisly and brutal was still over the top.)<br /><br />EASTERN PROMISES shows us Russian culture as well as the ugliness of the mob with its cold and stark inhumanity (the young working girls are treated like chattel).  It's brutal, dark, often terrifying, yet all of it is thoroughly believable.  Not a feel-good movie by any stretch, but very entertaining and informative.  Aragorn might not approve, but I do.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

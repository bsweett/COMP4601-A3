<meta name="summary" content="almost perfect"></head><body><p>The story is a romantic emotional one, taking place during the 1930s.<br /><br />The film director has played the emotional card rather well, and I must say the sets, the decors and costumes are marvelous.<br /><br />The actors were well cast, and is especially obvious through Briony.<br /><br />I say "almost perfect" because Keira Knightley just doesn't appear to act properly for the time period. All other actors are quite decent, and seem well directed. But Keira...<br /><br />Superb cinematography. The images are quite stunning.<br /><br />Clearly one of the best of 2007.</p></body></html>

The story has been altered to "modernize" it. Some roles were mis-cast. The basic story remains, however, and it is this that I review here.<br /><br />Comparisons between the 1951 original and this new incarnation are valid, because well hey, they used the title, right? Inevitably we look to Michael Rennie and Keanu Reeves. Mr. Rennie's performance was excellent for the times (I remember thinking so at the time). Rennie's "Klaatu" was an extremely informed EBE with knowledge of our habits, languages and technology, but THAT'S where things unravel just a bit. He seems to know everything about us, yet has conceptual difficulties on the simplest of human traits.<br /><br />So does Mr. Reeves' "Klaatu". For this new rendering, however, we get to see his "birth", and the synaptic difficulties he has with this new body. It's really not a stretch at this point to say that "he" actually has to experience being human to be able to make an "informed" decision regarding our fate (Reeves' conversation with James Hong's character confirms this). Reeves' "Klaatu" was a flat, very nearly monotone, dull and more than just a little forgettable kind of "person". How better to be, if you happen to be the one thing on Earth that Governments will kill to obtain.<br /><br />I LIKED GORT. In both films. Strong silent type you can't beat up, doesn't like violence and doesn't take crap from anyone (where can I get one?). In the 1951 original, GORT was just a somewhat minor character next to Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal.<br />In this new film, GORT gets to show off more of his race's capabilities that were only touched upon, in the 1951 original. The uneasiness of just being around Artificial Intelligence is effectively conveyed.<br /> Now we come to the heart of the matter. We all gonna die unless we shape up! In the 1951 original, it was goverments knocking off the wars and nukes, to save the Earth, and with it, ourselves. In the new film, we get an environmental message. Quit pooping where you eat, quit killing all the animals and quit polluting this rarest of worlds in the universe. Respect the Earth, and we save ourselves. They are both prime examples of their respective times. Still, the message remains the same.<br /><br />The lack of restraint and foresight on the part of us humans, upon Klaatu's arrival in both films underscores just how primitive we still are. Still, the preaching was uncomfortable, and that's how it was meant to be taken.<br /><br />I still find this rendering of "The Day The Earth Stood Still" a good one. the message is relevant to our times, and some would dislike this film because of it. This is NOT a political issue. It's a human one. If present methods don't seem to be doing much, reach a wider audience. What's wrong with that?</p></body></html>

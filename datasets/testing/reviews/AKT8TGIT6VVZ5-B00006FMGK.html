<meta name="summary" content="The Best ST: The Next Generation Film"></head><body><p>This is the film Paramount Pictures should have made for the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" crew for their theatrical debut, not the insipid "Star Trek: Generations". Although "Star Trek: First Contact" is slightly better with respect to pacing, "Star Trek Nemesis" is superior with regards to the script, acting and drama. Truly it is the "Next Generation" film which resonates most strongly with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's belief in mankind's ability in improving itself, as exemplified in the character of Lieutenant Commander Data (I shall not divulge any secrets, but Brent Spiner gives one of his finest performances as Data in this film.). <p>"Star Trek Nemesis" is also the most intelligent "Star Trek" film since "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country", with a villian, the Romulan Praetor Shinzon (portrayed well by young British actor Tom Hardy), who is a worthy adversary for Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the USS Enterprise of Khan-like proportions. "Star Trek Nemesis" is the most intelligent film in the franchise in years because of its thoughtful look at friendship, improving oneself with the goal of aiding others, and political intrigue within the Romulan Star Empire.<p>Other excellent performances are from Patrick Stewart as Picard, Dina Meyer as Romulan Commander Donatra and Ron Perlman as the Reman viceroy. Unfortunately, not enough screen time is given to most of the crew, though they do have their moments (for example, you'll laugh at Michael Dorn's Worf during one of the opening schemes of the film.). Jerry Goldsmith's concert hall-quality musical score, John Logan's excellent script and Stuart Baird's crisp direction are other splendid reasons for seeing "Star Trek Nemesis".<p>I hope Paramount Pictures will have yet another cinematic voyage for Picard and company. It's a shame the film isn't faring well due to stiff competition from "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"; surely it is one of the best installments in the "Star Trek" film franchise.</p></body></html>

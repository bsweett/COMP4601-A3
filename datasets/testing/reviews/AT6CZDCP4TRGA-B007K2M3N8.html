<meta name="summary" content="possibly Spacey's worst movie..."></head><body><p>Very few actors make the leap into directing successfully, especially when they star in their own movies.  Here, Kevin Spacey proves that he sure is no Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />Spacey does a competent job singing and acting, it's just his direction that makes this film embarassingly dull.  The musical numbers quickly become repetitive and pointless, adding nothing to character or plot development---in fact, the most engaging part of the film is the last 1/3 when we see Darin taking a long break from performing as he tries to "find himself."<br /><br />If you are going to have musical numbers that stand on their own as opposed to helping the character and plot develop, you'd better have some truly spectacular singing and dancing, which we simply don't get.  While Spacey tries his best to project showbiz charisma, he remains a hard-working amateur and the actual songs he does are not all that great either except for maybe "Mack the Knife."<br /><br />The storyline is ridiculously trite: poor sickly boy overcomes the odds through sweat and grit to become a smashing success, then (gasp!) is swallowed up by fame and somehow loses touch with himself.  Characters are mainly two-dimensional, with very mechanical and contrived growth.  Kate Bosworth provides some much needed eye-candy to distract us from the dead script, it's too bad she doesn't get more camera time.  John Goodman phones in a role he's done a million times before, the endearingly well-meaning but bumbling big fat beer buddy next door.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that you want to watch while doing something else half the time---playing with your cat, doing the crossword, skimming through the newspaper.<br /><br />Hopefully Spacey will develop into a decent director, but right now he's much better off sticking to acting.</p></body></html>

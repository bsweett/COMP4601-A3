You just can't mention this brilliant movie with giving kudos to an actress who steps into the shoes of England's current monarch and makes you believe with such eery success that she IS the Queen.<br /><br />This movie, one of the best of the year, looks at the life of Queen Elizabeth II, during the week of Diana's death.  With Tony Blair as a beginning Prime Minister (and played to perfection by actor Michael Sheen), the Queen tries to deal with the Diana's tragic death and the public's perception of how she should grieve.  Trying to protect Diana's young sons and preferring to hide at Balmoral, the Queen brings about the wrath of her citizens, seemingly acting in a cold and uncaring way to the death of a woman loved world wide.<br /><br />The movie is short and conise: the director concentrating on a dramatic time in the Queen's life, a turning point that perhaps changed the idea of the monarchy for the Queen and her public.  Mirren seems to fall away, becoming a woman who can't understand how she should be forced to deal with such a private matter in public, but eventually surrendering to the will of her people.  I found one scene very interesting, in which she grieves the lost of a brilliant stag, shot on a neighboring territory.  She waves him away, hoping to save him from hunters.  To me, the stag in a sense, was like Diana, beautiful but hunted incessantly.  However, with the stag, it seemed the Queen could grieve much easier and yet found it difficult to deal with the death of her grandchildren's mother.<br /><br />The cast does an incredible job with their roles (James Cromwell is [...]and mean spirited as Prince Philip) and as I mentioned before, Michael Sheen becomes Tony Blair.  The one actor I didn't care for was Alex Jennings who played Prince Charles.  He never seemed to get the mannerisms and character of the Prince of Wales, though the film treats him with sympathy as opposed to the other royals.  Other than that, this movie is deserving of winning the big award, Best Picture of the Year.<br /><br />If you enjoy great acting, the royal family or the brilliant Helen Mirren, you must go and see this film.  I look forward to the dvd release of this film!</p></body></html>

In its short lifespan in the public realm it has tended to polarize viewers into a camp that has dramatically overestimated its virtues and one that absurdly exaggerates its vices.  I belong somewhere in between.  I have often been impressed with the talents of Sacha Baron Cohen in the past, but have not always been convinced that they were being employed in a worthy manner.  I have often laughed my head off at Ali G., only to ask myself later, "What was the point?"  I can't help but wonder if there is a degree of cynicism underlying his work.  Much of his work depends on fooling other people into thinking this utter idiot he is portraying, whether Ali G., Borat, or Br&uuml;no, really exists.  Many of the interviews we are shown end up incredibly truncated, no doubt because those he is interviewing either walk away or see through his act.  Only rarely does someone figure him out and then join in (check out his interview as Ali G. of Pat Buchanan, who quickly figures him out when he asks whether or not Saddam had BLT's and Pat says that in fact Saddam used BLT's on his own people).  Who are we supposed to laugh at in these films and sketches?  Are we ever laughing with anyone, or only at people?  Sometimes we are clearly laughing at Borat and with Cohen at his creation.  But very frequently we end up laughing with the people populating his movie.  I had a great deal of trouble enjoying these scenes in the movie.<br /><br />It doesn't help that we can't always figure out when everyone in the scene is in on what is happening.  For instance, it is quite clear that Pamela Anderson was perfectly aware she was in a movie at the movie's end.  And the woman playing the prostitute who agrees to marry him at the end of the film obviously had to be in on the joke.  But it isn't clear that the owner of the antique store was aware.  If the owner wasn't aware, the grief Borat's antics caused anguish that I simply find unpleasant and if he was aware, it was simply not a very funny scene.  There were too many such moments in the movie.<br /><br />Despite these misgivings, however, there is no question that Cohen does an astonishing job as Borat.  He is gifted on so many levels:  he is a tremendous physical comedian, somewhat reminiscent of another tall graduate of Cambridge University, John Cleese.  He also has an astonishing gift for improvisation both in scripted and unscripted scenes.  Anyone who has seen him as Ali G. knows how he can make amazing adjustments with those he is interacting with.  And his ability to stay in character is a ceaseless wonder.  He is also a genuinely funny man.  I actually regret that all too often he seems more intent on seeing how far he can take things rather than trying to be funny, but he still manages to be incredibly funny in scene after scene.<br /><br />But, once again, to what purpose?  Many have referred to this as social satire, but I can't acknowledge that it ascends to that level.  There is no doubt that he wants us to see America as being as strange as we find Borat and he certainly finds a number of incredibly quirky people.  The scene in which he has dinner with a dining club the South illustrates this perfectly.  Despite his absolutely bizarre behavior, he somehow manages to make the diners look as bizarre as he does.  In the end, it doesn't reach the genuinely satiric levels of Albert Brooks or Neil LaBute, but neither does it become something that merely mines the gross and bizarre for laughs like HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE.<br /><br />By the end of the film I had winced a lot, groaned a bit, and shook my head in discomfort, but I also laughed very, very hard on many occasions.  I don't know if this adds up to a recommendation or not, but I can honestly say that except for the Borat skits on DA ALI G. SHOW, you certainly haven't seen anything like this before.</p></body></html>

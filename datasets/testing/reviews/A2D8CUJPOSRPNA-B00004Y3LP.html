<meta name="summary" content="When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth...Again!"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg has always been my favorite movie director because of his innate ability to tap into people's fears, hopes, and aspirations.  And while he may not always be successful at it (1941 and HOOK being examples), he is successful far more often than not.  JURASSIC PARK, based on Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, is a prime example of Spielberg's abilities.<p>The story revolves around the dreams of an eccentric billionaire (Richard Attenborough) to construct an amusement park on an island 120 miles off of Costa Rica that features genetically engineered dinosaurs, created from cloning dinosaur DNA.  He invites two paleontologists (Sam Neill, Laura Dern) to the island to check it out for themselves, along with a hugely cynical &quot;chaos&quot; mathematician (Jeff Goldblum).  But while the park itself is overwhelming to its visitors, including Attenborough's two grandkids (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards), there is a strong feeling that Attenborough and his fellow creators have left a few things out.<p>Then it hits.  An overly ambitious security expert (Wayne Knight) has involved himself in smuggling dinosaur embryos off the island for a competitor.  But the only way to pull it off is to shut down the entire park's security systems...which is exactly what happens, unfortunately.  With the fifty miles worth of electrified fences shut off, and a tropical storm lashing the island, the dinosaurs break free of their enclosures.  What results is some of the most terrifying and suspenseful sequences of 1990s cinema, from a director who clearly studied the techniques of the Master, Alfred Hitchcock.<p>Winner of three Oscars (Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Visual Effects) and a $1 billion box office winner to boot, JURASSIC PARK, scripted by Crichton and David Koepp, is a hugely entertaining and relevant science fiction/suspense thriller that, while giving audiences the requisite chills and thrills, also has a warning about the potential dangers of cloning, which now seem to be coming perilously true in reality.  Even well-meaning enterprises like this film's amusement park are susceptible to human failures or lapses of morality.<p>Neill, Dern, Goldblum, and Attenborough are pretty good in their roles; and, contrary to what others might think, I don't think the special effects overshadow them.  John Williams, yet again, provides Spielberg with another memorable music score.  Followed four years later by THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (a very respectable sequel), and in 2001 by JURASSIC PARK 3.</p></body></html>

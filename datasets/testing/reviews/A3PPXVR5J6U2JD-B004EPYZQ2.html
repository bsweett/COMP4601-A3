These were the days of E.T., Goonies, and The Monster Squad, where kids laughed, cried, and fought while having adventures.  It's pretty much how adults remember their childhood summers, free of the soul-crushing realities of school, puberty, and adults. If you look back on your misspent youth in the early 80s with nostalgia, then Super 8 is for you.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams has seen those movies, and with papa Spielberg's blessings, wants you to see them too.  Although this film is ostensibly about a child (Joel Courtney as Joe) coming to grips with the death of his mother, it is not for children.  There's swearing, drug use, and violence - pretty much what you would expect from a film set in the early 80s. In fact, despite the lens flares, the out of focus camera work, and the soaring musical score, Super 8 distinguishes itself from other coming-of-age-with-aliens flicks with its unrelenting violence. The alien in Super 8 is big, mean, and angry, and he expresses that anger by eating people.<br /><br />The alien is a stand in for the adult rage that seethes throughout the town of Lillian, Ohio.  It's destroying father and widower Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) from the inside.  It haunts Louis Daniard (Ron Eldard), who was indirectly involved in the accident that killed Joe's mother.  And it is passed on to the children, manifesting with painful eloquence in Louis' daughter Alice (Elle Fanning, bred from a race of superactresses).  When Joe finally confronts the beast, boy and alien finally see each other for who they really are: innocents thrust into bad situations.  Will their tortured legacy define them o r will they rise above it?<br /><br />Heady stuff for a movie, and Abrams' deft movie-making elevates a straightforward plot that might otherwise be lost in the alien-invasion morass.  The film is beautifully shot and, for the most part, tightly scripted.  But once boy and alien face off, the movie loses a lot of its momentum.<br /><br />Lurking throughout the military vs. townies vs. alien conflict is a hope of redemption for both Louis and Jackson.  This redemption is found in a car ride rescue by the parents, who of course don't rescue the kids at all.  Basically, the two guys could have had a beer and come to the same conclusions, but for pacing purposes it happens in a car.<br /><br />And that's where Super 8 isn't quite as successful. The ending struggles to mash the alien's resolution with a father and son reunited, complete with a symbolic locket of motherly love. It feels a bit forced, which detracts from an otherwise pitch perfect tale about filmmaking, death, and meeting girls.<br /><br />With less warmth than E.T. but a better script than Signs, Super 8 is a nostalgia-fueled trip for fans of horror and sci-fi who remember using words like "mint." Everyone else might be a little bored.<br /><br />Except for zombie fans.  Zombie fans will be pleased.</p></body></html>

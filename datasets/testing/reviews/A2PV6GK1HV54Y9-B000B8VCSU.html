<meta name="summary" content="White Rabbit."></head><body><p>8 Mile starring rap superstar Eminem was his feature film debut, and even though he hasn't done a movie since, his performance as struggling rapper Rabbit got my approval. I don't care for his music but his first try at acting isn't too shabby. Co-starring Kim Basinger as Rabbit's alcoholic mother and Brittany Murphy as a naughty girl that he meets also give standout performances. 8 Mile does have some awkward moments but director Curtis Hanson pulls off another almost solid film. Get this movie if you like "underdog" stories. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

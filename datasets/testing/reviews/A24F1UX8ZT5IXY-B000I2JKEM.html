<meta name="summary" content=""Tim Burton's" Corpse Bride: A grave injustice."></head><body><p>If there ever was a three-star film on Amazon, it's Corpse Bride. And for a very simple reason. It's math:<br /><br />Art Direction: 5 Stars<br /><br />Story: 3 stars<br /><br />Execution of Story: 2 Stars<br /><br />Hence, 3 stars. Calling it Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is an injustice. Because Tim Burton is most of what is WRONG with this film. As was the case with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, he has abandoned the 5,000-year-old tradition of placing characters and plot at the center of a story and has decided to damn the torpedoes and just lard his films with visuals.<br /><br />That, unfortunately, is all that Corpse Bride really has, and old Timmy didn't make hardly a frame of it. The story, what little of it there is, has it all wrong. Do not make the "Corpse Bride" the most interesting character and then focus the story on the two main dullards. Who is she? Where does she live? What are her emotions? All touched on, none explored.<br /><br />At a little over an hour in length, this is less of a film than an afterschool special. Kind of like the best thing you would have seen on Pee-Wee's playhouse or something.</p></body></html>

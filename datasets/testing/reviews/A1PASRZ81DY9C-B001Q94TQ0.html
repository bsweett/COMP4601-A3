The review was favorable, and I shelved the title on my list of movies to see. It's been there for some while until I finally spotted it in a local library. I hadn't known the story yet until watching the picture. When the first mention of the city Bogota showed up, I thought it was obviously going to be a story about drugs. When it was, I was right until I realized where the picture will lead me. It's a quite astounding story, and a wonderfully made picture at that. Its drawback is that it doesn't feel realistic enough. Nonetheless, the performances throughout the film are outstanding and outstanding. Catalina Sandino Moreno carried the film all the way from start to end. Maria Full of Grace painted a somber picture of girls who swallow pellets of drugs. When I say pellets, I mean the size of meatballs with cocaine in them. When I say pellets of drugs, that's in the vicinity of seventy of them. Sounds like your worst case of digestive system nightmare. And yes, it is. Aside from that, the walk-through of the young girl's life was well-appreciated, self-paced, and absorbing. I was pleased with the two sides of the story: Colombia and New York. Both were handled extremely well with the same level of excellence. That New York side was rather heightened with fear, anxiety, and suspense. All in all, since it does not glorify the surroundings like City of God, Maria Full of Grace is a very impressive picture.</p></body></html>

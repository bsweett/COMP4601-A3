<meta name="summary" content="Can't Stop This Beat"></head><body><p>Our story opens in 1962 Baltimore.  Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a high school student with a passion to dance.  Every day, she rushes home from school with her best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) to watch The Corny Collins Show.  On it, a group of teens dance to the latest hits.<br /><br />When the show has an open casting for a new dancer (one of the regulars is going on a nine month vacation), Tracy wants to go audition.  Her mother Edna (John Travolta) is against it.  See, Tracy is a plus size girl, and Edna is an even bigger woman.  Edna hides in the house because of her size and fears the rejection could crush Tracy.<br /><br />Tracy does get rejected at first, but a second chance gets her a part on the show.  She's an instant hit and her star power rises.<br /><br />This doesn't sit well with Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer).  Velma is in charge of the show, and uses her power to build a career for her daughter Amber (Brittany Snow).<br /><br />Even more dangerous, Tracy has some ideas about the once monthly Negro Day.  She thinks that instead of being the last Tuesday of the month, it should be every day.  Is this a good cause?  Can Tracy's new found star power help with integration?  Or will the show stay segregated?<br /><br />Obviously, the movie has a serious message, but it is never preachy.  It never forgets its first mission is to entertain us.  And it is very entertaining.  Well over half the movie is made up of songs, and they are all fun 60's pop.  The choreography was wonderful, featuring some truly imaginative stuff that expands beyond the stage, even when the song was part of the Corny Collins Show.  And all but one of the actors was great.  This is especially true of Nikki Blonsky is who perfect as Tracy.<br /><br />So what was the bad?  First, there's John Travolta.  I know it's a tradition of this musical that Edna is played by a cross dressing man.  But I'm sorry, I just never bought John Travolta as a woman.  Either way, every time he was on screen was annoying.  Like fingernails on chalkboard annoying.<br /><br />One of the characters is a bigoted Bible thumper.  Fortunately, she's a minor character, but you can bet how well that went over with this Christian.<br /><br />The movie skips around just a little too much.  I actually felt like the movie could have been a little longer with just a couple added scenes to better develop the characters and story.  It just felt like a piece was missing.<br /><br />Finally, there are the sexual innuendos and racial slurs.  I understand the racial slurs were acceptable for the time.  While they did bother my modern ears, I could accept them for the sack of accuracy.  But the innuendos really bothered me.  Why?  Because they felt out of place, especially when said on the squeaky clean TV show.  The movie definitely would have been stronger if they'd been taken out.<br /><br />In the end, this movie is a mixed basket.  Its fun with mostly great acting, but the flaws are fairly serious.</p></body></html>

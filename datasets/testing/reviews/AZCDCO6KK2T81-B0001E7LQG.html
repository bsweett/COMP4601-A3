Great acting, superior script writing, and well-paced directing make this a must see film.  It's a surprise that this film got made at all.  Imagine, a film about people over 50 being sexually active and still seeking love.  I'm not talking 60+ Harrison Ford with anorexic 30-something "Alley McBeal" sexually active, but two people over 50 sexually active with each other.  In fact, both, I think, are actually in their sixties.  Hollywood is obssessed with either youth or the older man/younger woman relationship.  We rarely see young men with older women or two 50+ individuals in a romantic relationship.<br /><br />It's also wonderful to see mature women not embarrassed or ashamed of how they've aged.  Diane Keaton looked radiant in the film; I don't care what age she is.  There are many other actresses these days who have aged very gracefully and are still a pleasure to see on the silver screen.  Anne Archer, Meryl Streep, Debra Winger, and Goldie Hawn are just a handful that come to mind.  It's nice that Hollywood has continued to give these terrific actresses top billing instead of putting them out to pasture.</p></body></html>

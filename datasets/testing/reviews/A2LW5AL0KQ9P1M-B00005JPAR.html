<meta name="summary" content="Breathtaking . . . But There is a Caveat . . ."></head><body><p>This film is a artistic masterpiece. Its graceful beauty is does not permit debate. It will be an exquisite experience for any lover of art. The sheer visual originality will transfix the viewer. It is without pretense . . . its message is universal.<br /><br />Here is the caveat: you need not be "educated" in film to understand this work . . . you need not be a Ph.D. holder to enjoy its majesty . . . you need not have any background in Early Colonialism to follow Aronofsky's thoughts . . . but you do need to be patient. You need to prepare yourself for a visual experience that rivals Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. You need to surrender yourself to Aronofsky's vision. His non-linear approach may initially confuse the viewer . . . his metaphors may initially frustrate . . . . his repetition may initially annoy . . . but try to understand these aspects as essential to the film's glory. Trust Aronofsky to guide you through the film . . . the more you resist his approach, the less you will be inclined to enjoy it.<br /><br />Some label this film a "tear-jerker" . . . this is a terrible misnomer. Aronofsky's work did not steal one tear from my companion or me. This is not as much a work about two people, but is allegorical. So, if you are concerned that this film is a "romance," you can dismiss those fears entirely.<br /><br />This film is similar to neither Requiem nor Pi . . . that is Aronofsky's genius. He is gifted with uncommon range. Moreover, this is not the Hugh Jackman with which many are acquainted . . . his acting is sensitive to detail and strikingly stark. Rachel Weisz enthusiasts may be equally surprised . . . but hopefully in positive manner.<br /><br />Here is the bottom line: this is neither X-Men nor The Mummy, it is neither Pi nor Requiem . . . this film is as innovative as it is spectacular. Nonetheless, if you need a linear plot, if you must have explanations, if you have limited patience, you will find yourself frustrated. But, if you find yourself bored with contemporary film, tired of its predictability, exhausted with its pedestrian qualities . . . if you simply yearn to view a challenging work of art, allow The Fountain to work its uncanny "magic" on you.</p></body></html>

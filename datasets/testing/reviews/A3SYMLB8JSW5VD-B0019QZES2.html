<meta name="summary" content="We love the Fockers"></head><body><p>This is hands-down one of the funniest movies ever. The movie starts out with meeting of Gaylord Fockers's parents. Who are funny as they are embarassing. The clear star of this movie is Barbara Streisand who plays a geriatric sex therapist. If you are looking to have a good time at the movies. This is the movie to see.</p></body></html>

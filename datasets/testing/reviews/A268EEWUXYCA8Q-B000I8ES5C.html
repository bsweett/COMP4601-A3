If that combination makes you laugh then you will undoubtably love this movie.<br /><br />The beginning brilliantly sets up the antagonists by showing how ruthless and bloodthirsty they are before going to the beginning credits and having the Axe Gang then dance to the music.  It's a wonderful beginning, showing the dichotomy of a ruthless gang that dances like they belong in a musical.  Very funny.<br /><br />When the movie begins in earnest, we are introduced to Pig Sty Alley where poor people are scrambling to live day by day.  Stephen Chow populates his area with wonderful characters who are hillariously funny and different from each other.  They all have motives, sometimes hidden, and it makes watching them quite humorous.<br /><br />But what Kung Fu Hustle does best is play with the martial arts conventions.  Like Wuxia films, the characters possess supernatural abilities to send swords flying by playing instruments and other plot spoiling devices.  But unlike some Wuxia films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, they are taken to the extreme as a sort of satire of the genre while at the same time embracing everything wonderful about those films.  The martial arts are spot on, having been done by the wonderful choreographer of The Matrix and Kill Bill Woo-ping Yuen.  Yet unlike those films and again in touch with the style of the movie, the action is playful.<br /><br />The violence is over the top, stylized with sequenes that remind us of the Looney Tunes cartoons.  In fact, Stephen Chow incorporates a lot of homages to American Cinema with quotes in line with Spider Man and the Matrix and even a sound sampling from the Matrix in a couple scenes.  It's funny to catch.<br /><br />Overall a terrific film that incorporates Oriental cinema with Western cinema.  Brilliantly shot, written and acted, it successfully merges many totally disparate genres into a movie that satirizes, makes homages to, and transcends the martial arts genres.  Absolutely wonderful a must see for all fans.</p></body></html>

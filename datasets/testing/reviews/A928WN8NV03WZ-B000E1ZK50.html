Like Frankenstein vs the Wolfman, or Zombies Ate My Neighbors.<br /><br />The movie is about Van Helsing. A man who is being employed by a secret service like organization to hunt down supernatural menaces. In his first encounter he is hunting down the evil Mr Hyde, and to try to get Dr Jeckyl back alive. The order is a mixture of priests and monks of seemingly every faith on the planet, all banding together to save humanity from dark forces.<br /><br />He is paired with an inventor and a monk named Carl(David Wenham, Faramir in LOTR). Though he can swear and womanize since, he is not a monk yet. They are sent on a mission to Eastern Europe, which not only suffers from Werewolves but Vampires. He brings a host of odd high tech weapons to fight the supernatural with. They are in the steam punk genre; automatic crossbows, crank powered saws, etc....<br /><br />It turns out that there is more than they expected. Count Vladislaus Dracula is working on animating his children, thousands and thousands of them, who lie dormant. He uses lightening, but for some reason the energy given to them is never quite right, and they die soon after. There is also some tie between him and Dracula, one that goes far back that he doesn't remember.<br /><br />This movie was so ridiculous it bordered on genius. The plot makes little sense, the acting is over the top and at times purposefully bad, and the plot devices are shamelessly obvious. In other words, it is the movie you watch with beer and lots of junk food.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be a sequel</p></body></html>

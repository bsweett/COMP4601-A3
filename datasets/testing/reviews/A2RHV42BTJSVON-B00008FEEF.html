<meta name="summary" content="The first Halloween was much better!!!"></head><body><p>In my opinion this is a very stupid and unrealistic sequal I mean I know for a fact that there is more then about 10 people working graveyard shift at the hospitals!!!There are always the same amount of people!!!And in this movie there is hardly any hospital staff and it relies to much on killing...I was highly disapointed with this movie it did not at all meet up to my expectations and they were not very high either...The acting was good and that's the only thing that kept me from rating this movie any lower...Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job as usual.!And that guy who wants her is quite charming,in this sequal you find out Michael the reason Michael Meyers wants to kill her is because he is her brother...</p></body></html>

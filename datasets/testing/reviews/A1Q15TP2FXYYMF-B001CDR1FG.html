<meta name="summary" content="I Loved It"></head><body><p>I admit this movie was very dissapointing because in alot of eyes it turned out to be a let down and in some ways it was.<br /><br />My thoughts are it was an excellent film that described the life of Bruce Banner and how he came to hold the gene that would turn him into the Hulk.<br /><br />There was over the course of the movie too much going on at any one time that would distract you from what you were ment to focus on and after that scene would end you would have to repeat the scene because you missed something and in my eyes that isn't good.<br /><br />The only really positive parts of the movie where the special effects & the action scenes. Eric Bana's performance was mediocre at best and in parts of the movie it was very hard to take him as the character seriously.<br /><br />Apparently they are in the process of making a sequel and Eric Bana is even considering taking the part again, they aren't using the same director and to me that's a good thing because the movie had the potential to be the best ever and it wasn't so let's hope the new Hulk movie is better than the first which in my opinion was great anyway.</p></body></html>

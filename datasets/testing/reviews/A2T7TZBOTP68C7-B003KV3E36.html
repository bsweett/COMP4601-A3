The film opens showing the cruelty of the current Burmese regime as they make prisoners run across a field littered with land mines.  That is one of the many things I appreciated about this film.  In today's politically correct Hollywood, foreign countries are actually made up so as not to offend.  But like Rambo, this movie shows guts, figuratively and literally!  Yes, the film is violent and graphic, but it moves very fast so the eyes do not linger on it, as it did in Apocalypto.<br /><br />The story finds Rambo reluctantly bringing Christian missionaries/doctors to Burma in his boat.  Some part of the hardened soul is touched by the honest and naiive/optimistic view of a female missionary.  When they are kidnapped by the Burmese army, the church's pastor goes to the American Embassy in Washington, D.C. for help, but they say their hands are tied, so the pastor hires a group of mercenaries.  Mercenaries meet Rambo, and the awesome action and story begins.  Every aspect of the film is top-notch: music, acting, and the sound engineering on this DVD was superior.<br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

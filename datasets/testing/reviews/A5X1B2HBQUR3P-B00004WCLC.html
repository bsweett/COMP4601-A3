PT anderson directs this movie as an epic and he paints this expansive story about a bunch of individuals with an operatic pallete. The soundtrack score is the most bold and audacious. There is a long sequence of shots which is accompanied by repeated staccato notes. The director and the composer are being bold here. Right from the prologue scene up until say 45 mins into the movie, PT anderson builds the scenario with the bold score and his balletic and long steady cam shots. The problem is that the the build up is so good that the movie is forever building up. The premise we are given is that these seemingly disconnected lives playing out in parallel are going to come together in some unexpected commonality or shall we say a kind of "got you" twist ending. But it isn't meant to be a Shymalan film although the first half plays so mysteriously that keeps you wondering "where is this movie heading" and what has all of these seperate stories got in common. PT anderson's amazing direction of the story makes us believe there is more to this and there is a higher plan in all of this that we are not seeing. But plain and simple this is still just a story about those seperate characters who often have a single of multiple connection to the other characters in terms of aquantainces and relationships. I enjoyed the film for the pure art of the film making of it and the amazing element of suspense that is bred into the story which keeps us guessing on where the story is heading. The movie ends in a sequence of scenes of biblical proportions. Although the matter in the story is little, the style and execution of the screen play is eye candy. I loved this movie. It's one of those 3 hr movies which you can actually see again right after you finished your first viewing. Extras include - behing the sceens dairy of the production, interviews with actors and PT anderson and the co-writers of the movie. This one is an all time cult classic for me.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

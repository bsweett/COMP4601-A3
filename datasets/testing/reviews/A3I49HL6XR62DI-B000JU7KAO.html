A group of misfit residents in an apartment complex called The Cove find their destinies when their lives intersect with a water nymph named Story. Paul Giamatti will make you cry in a poignant performance as a man who has lost his family through violence and who finds a purpose in life that he could never have imagined. M. Night Shyamalan performs in the film and he is arresting. Highly recommended. The special effects are unbelievably good. A special, spiritual film. You will like it if you are into M. Night Shyamalan's films, otherwise, you may find it not to your taste.</p></body></html>

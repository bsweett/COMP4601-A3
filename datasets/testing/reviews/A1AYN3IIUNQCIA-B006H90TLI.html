<meta name="summary" content="A Movie About a Whole Lot of Nothing"></head><body><p>Warning: Minor Spoliers<br /><br />For the past three years or so, I have been pretty oppossed to the Academy Awards and their Best Picture winners (the last of which I truley accepted being The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King). Million Dollar Baby was a nice movie, but it didn't stick with me in the long run. Crash was a very mediocre film that only got lucky because of its LA fan base and conservative members (Brokeback Mountain was by far superior and should have won), The Departed was pretty good but not one of my favorites of the whole year, and now, this years winner, No Country for Old Men, has won the award and so naturally, I had to see it. I've obviously heard about the raves this film has been getting, most everyone calling it a masterpiece, saying it was the best film in a long time and picked up almost every single major Best Picture awards. I figured, there must be something about the film thats so great.<br /><br />The film intwertwins three diffrent story lines that all seem to center around a drug deal gone bad. Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon the massacer and along with the huge pile of drugs, finds a suitcase full of money. So naturally, he takes it. Unfortunatly for him, he has just stumbled into a dangerous situation and is now being hunted down by a hired gun name Anton Chigurh, while a local sherrif is right behind them as he tries to piece together the whole crime.<br /><br />For the positives, I definently agree that all the acting was pretty good, Javier Bardem just morphing into a great villian. With steely eyes, cold determination, he's like a walking Reaper, armed with his pressurized gun and killing almost everyone unfortunate to cross his path. Tommy Lee Jones makes the most of his small role while Josh Brolin took me by surprise with his pretty restrained performence and Kelly MacDonald also surprising me with her nice gem of a role. Even Beth Grant does wonders in her role that literally only last for over a minute. So, bravo to the actors.<br /><br />However, and this is the big however, my one big problem with this movie is this. When its all said and done, the film was really just a whole bunch of nothing. Sure, we know there's a drug deal and money and a killer and all that stuff and there was a pretty thrilling scene during the middle but its almost as if the film just obidently trudges on through the film, having its characters do all this stuff and say all these things, and by the end, what does it all add up to? Is it a film about free will? or the after match of violence? is the whole thing about violence? changing times? what was this whole movie about?<br /><br />Now, to put it out, I have never really been a Coen Brothers fan. I just don't get any of there movies. Maybe i'm just the odd one out but I honestly don't see anything when I watch there films. Blood Simple, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, all of those films I just found either very average, completly upsurd, or just plain weird. So even before I was going to view this movie, I already had an idea that this may not live up to all the hype its getting.<br /><br />Another problem I have is with the ending. Now, I don't mind open ended movies. Hell, I think that a film can be superb with an open end. But for me, when the whole thing ended, I really just thought it was almost like a complete waste of my time. Again, the whole ending added up to nothing. I ask you, what was the whole point in the sherrif's ending speech? what significance did it have with the whole of the film? why are we shown Chigurh getting hit by some car at the end? is there something there that I'm not getting? and the whole thing with the sherrif and his uncle, again, what was the whole point of that scene? are we suppose to take notice and say 'yeah, violence, its always going to be there and stuff'. And as for Woody Harrelson, can someone tell me the whole purpose of his role? I mean, did he really had anything to the story? at all?. Basically, in general, were those last 30 minutes or so ABOSULTLY nessesary?<br /><br />I really just think this film is a critics film. Something that all the professionals rave about and absolutly adore and love. But for the general public, it dosen't always translate like that. For people like me, its just a jumble of events that lead to a pretty vacant (and slightly pointless) ending. For others, its a masterpiece of a film and the critics are right to cheer and its one of those films that has to be seen. And for some, they just won't get it at all and leave the theater (or television room) scratching there heads in frustration.<br /><br />In short, No Country for Old Men can arguably be added up to a film about a lot of nothing. For me, a film (no matter how great or bad) has some sort of meaning to its making, some sort of theme that drives it along. But as the credits begin to role and your sitting in your seat wonder 'so what exactly was that all about?', it just seems sort of like a waste of time. For the critics and all those who love this film, thats good for you and obviously you all see something that I'm not seeing. Cause all I see is a film of pointless violence, pointless talk, pointless scenes, and basically a handful of pretty 'decent' moments and great acting, all of which add up to...nothing.<br /><br />I guess I'll have to see what next years Best Picture winner has to offer. Who know's, maybe</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hugely overrated and somewhat dull; I don't think this aged very well..."></head><body><p>A lot of people will disagree with me here, and I won't fault them a bit.  `The Manchurian Candidate' is considered a classic and so just about everyone and their mother is going to be up in arms when they read this review.<br /><br />I just didn't get it.<br /><br />That statement isn't to say that I didn't understand it, it's to say that I just didn't get why this could be considered so grand a film.  It is touted as one of the most chilling and suspenseful political thrillers of all time, but quite honestly I found most of the film rather corny and the other half was plain dull.  The only aspect of the film that kept me entertained was Angela Lansbury's brilliant portrayal of the evil Mrs. Iselin.  She understood how to work with what she was given, stripping away the corn that was so prevalent and delivering a flawlessly chilled performance.<br /><br />So, the film tells of Bennett Marco who is having strange dreams involving the brainwashing of his platoon, all of it having something to do with Raymond Shaw, a decorated war hero whose new title seems to strike Bennett as odd; since Raymond was no hero.  As Bennett starts to unlock the truth, Raymond's dastardly mother Mrs. Iselin gets desperate to have her son complete the task before him.<br /><br />I can understand why maybe this was considered so great back when it was released, but quite honestly, I do see how this can still be considered great.  The plot is simple, yet it is overdone far too much in areas.  The acting aside from Lansbury is decent at best, with Laurence Harvey turning in a dreadful performance (and I thought after seeing `A Room at the Top' that he could do NO WRONG) and Frank Sinatra struggles to define himself here.  He does a decent job in parts, but overall he appears to be struggling.  I also felt that technically the film had some issues, especially towards the beginning, with the voiceover.  I thought that some of the major plot developments were a tad corny, some of them not just a tad, and they took away from the `chilling' aspects of the film.  I also felt that the pacing in the films center was horrible.  It drug out the prose too long and added back story that, if handled properly could have been interesting, but wound up feeling unnecessary.<br /><br />The film starts off on the low side of decent, takes a dive into mediocre and then struggles to redeem itself with a surprisingly riveting ending that just doesn't have enough to completely save the film entirely.<br /><br />Like I said, this is not a popular opinion, but it is mine none-the-less, and any of you who are familiar with my reviews know that I am honest always.  You may love this movie, and if so feel free to defend it (that's what the comment section is for) but I personally just didn't get it.  I adored Lansbury, but as far as political thrillers go, this one lacks any real bite.</p></body></html>

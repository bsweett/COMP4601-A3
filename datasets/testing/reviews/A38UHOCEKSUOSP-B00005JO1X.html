<meta name="summary" content="[4.5] A beautiful tale created into an epic film"></head><body><p>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is based from the first Book in the Chronicle of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis.  The book was actually required reading in my elementary school, so I was already quite familiar with the story.  There was an animated film created years ago, but it was very uninspiring, and I believe it to have been a direct to video release.  I was more than ecstatic when I learned the a real movie was coming to theatres, and the previews looked tremendous.  It was enough to assure that this was going to be big.  Epic big, as in The Lord of The Rings traditional sense.  The movie did not let me down.  It started out a little slow, but by time the climax approached, something triggered all kinds of positive emotions within.  This is a powerful tale, and perhaps even more powerfully transfered to the big screen.<br /><br />There are two ways of looking at this film.  One, is for pure entertainment.  The second, is on a religious perspective.  C.S. Lewis has been known for being a Christian author, and fascinated with placing religious events into fantasy lands.  It is very evident that this movie has those influences, and any watcher will pick up on the Biblical references throughout the story.  I actually chose option three, and that was watching it both for entertainment and for its content, and in the end, I felt I had watched something very satisfying and very complete.<br /><br />Happiness, excitement, despair, hope, and even war.  They are all in this film, and there are all well felt.  Its not just the story alone that shares practically all forms of emotion and character, and not even the characters in the film too, but the cinematography, directing, and musical score add so much to complete the tone.  The camera gives us plenty of wonderful sweeping shots of the landscape, which begins as winter in Narnia and eventually shoots into spring.  The score, is worth purchasing on cd.  Every scene of music fits so well and is so neat with what is going on in Narnia.  Then you have the final climatic showdown, where the good vs evil armies fight in war.  The score is both energetic and iluminating, getting you pumped to cheer on the good guys (or bad, if you wish).<br /><br />Perhaps one of the coolest things about the film are some of the effects, and more specifically, the way the creatures are used.  This isn't like Lord of The Rings where you got some elves and orcs - you generally have a mix of hundreds of creatures and animals in Narnia.  Bears, tigers, bulls, oxen, and wolves are just a few that shine, and all clash in the final battle.<br /><br />Another wonderful thing about this film is it is well suited for people of all ages.  If it weren't for the big battle in the end, this would easily have been a G rated film.  Though the fights go on for maybe a total of 10 minutes, there is no blood and the camera does a smooth job of skipping the details of swords piercing through bodies.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful film that would make most feel really good when walking away.  Though most people will clearly see the religious refernces, there is great entertainment value in this too.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wild Hogs"></head><body><p>The Wild Hogs is a motorcycle gang made up of four middle-aged men.  Doug (Allen) is a dentist. Woody (Travolta) is unemployed. Bobby (Lawrence) is a sewage engineer. Dudley (Macy) is a computer engineer.  They embark on a road trip to put some excitement into their lives.  Along the way, they run into the Del Fuegos, a real motorcycle gang, and barely manage to survive the encounter.  They seek refuge in Madrid, where Dudley meets Maggie (Tomei) and takes a liking to her.  Meanwhile, the Del Fuegos find out where the Hogs are, and come looking for them.<br /><br />"Wild Hogs" is an uneven movie that has some good moments, but they are balanced out by some unfunny ones.  Most of the major laughs can be seen in the previews, and that is never a good sign.  The four leads have a camaraderie that is believeable, and that is perhaps what saves the movie in the end.  This is by no means the best movie for any of them, but there is enough here that many will enjoy it.  I recommend waiting for the DVD.</p></body></html>

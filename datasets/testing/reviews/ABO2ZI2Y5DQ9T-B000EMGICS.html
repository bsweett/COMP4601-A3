<meta name="summary" content="Starts with a Clever Idea, Turns a Middling Romantic Comedy with Disappointing Ending"></head><body><p>`Rumor Has It' has two good things in it: interesting cast including hilarious Shirley MacLaine, and Ted Griffin's curious and intriguing idea about the 'origin' of classic film `The Graduate.' For the reasons I don't know Griffin (who is attached to the film as director) left the set, and Rob Reiner took up the project. Then something happened to the film, which should be more original and intriguing. `Rumor Has It' is still cozy and charming in its own way, but is a great missed opportunity.<br /><br />The plot starts like a standard romantic comedy, but there is one clever twist in it; that is, Jennifer Aniston's heroine Sarah, already vaguely angst-ridden about her future, suddenly finds the `Truths' about her mother's life. Sarah comes to believe that her deceased mom was actually the model of Katherine Ross character in `The Graduate.' Charles Webb, she insists, wrote the story of Benjamin Braddock in `The Graduate' based on the real life of one Beau Burroughs, who is still living somewhere in America.<br /><br />Leaving behind her nice and understanding fianc&eacute;e (played by underrated Mark Ruffalo), Sarah travels to meet Beau (Kevin Costner). The consequences of their meeting should not be told here, but anyway you can tell from the miles away.<br /><br />Very clever and intelligent initial setting gradually turns into a middling rom-com path where so many others have already passed. It is Rob Reiner who once directed charming `When Harry Met Sally...' and we naturally expect something better or different. But sorry, no such luck here.<br /><br />Naturally (and deservedly) Shirley MacLaine steals every scene as the grandmother with an acid tongue. Richard Jenkins is excellent as Sarah's slightly odd father, cute Mena Suvari is cute as ever, and you even see handsome Mike Vogel. Uncredited Kathy Bates also appears (with a very strange hair), and Jennifer Aniston and Mark Raffalo are both good, the incarnation of nice, good-looking American couple, if nothing more. But Kevin Costner is a huge disappointment, who should have been the inspiration of Dustin Hoffman character in `The Graduate' but shows little of the charms of Ben of the Mike Nichols film.<br /><br />Oh, and the closing chapters are simply banal, throwing away any cleverness of the original idea about `The Graduate' or the life in Pasadena, and take the safest course throughout. If Shirley Maclaine had punched Costner in the face, the film would be much funnier. I expected to see something like that, but got no chance of seeing it. Just a comfortable, unoriginal, and insipid ending of `Ever After.'</p></body></html>

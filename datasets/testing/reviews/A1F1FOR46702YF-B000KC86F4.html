<meta name="summary" content="Meet the Mutants"></head><body><p>Director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour 1 & 2) takes over the successful comic book franchise in the highly anticipated summer blockbuster "X-Men: The Last Stand". As tensions between humans and mutants continue to escalate, a "cure" for mutations grips an already unsettled mutant population. Now, opposing mutant leaders Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) clash for the ultimate battle that will ensure the future of all mutants. "X-Men: The Last Stand" is an entertaining action-packed summer joyride that became one of the highest grossing films of 2006. The 108-minute Sci-Fi adventure lacks the strong emotive mood and rich character development of the first two films. The latest chapter in the "X-Men" series has a few emotionally touching moments, cool eye-popping visual effects, terrific action sequences and an appealing cast including Emmy winner Kelsey Grammer as the intelligent blue-haired Beast. Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen deliver their share of memorable moments.<br /><br />Complete the trilogy with "X-Men: The Last Stand". The latest blockbuster sequel is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is somewhat weaker than previous X-Men DVDs but it is still a pretty sharp and brightly colored transfer. It's Dolby Digital and DTS audio tracks are the real highlights in this release and provide a top notch home theater experience. The DVD features two decent audio commentaries with director Brett Ratner and film crew, trailers, deleted and extended scenes and three alternate endings with optional audio commentary. Overall, "X-Men: The Last Stand" scores a worthy "B".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful adventure/romance/children's movie"></head><body><p>In comparison to the tripe that Disney produces now, this movie is even  more classic than it was when it was first made. The classic story of  &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; was ALMOST never better-produced (I still think  the &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; version is best, sadly not produced  anymore)<p>The animation is unusual for a Disney production--it adds length  and the appearance of fitness to the bodies of the humans, while making the  fairies... rotund? But the animation, rather than making the characters  look like the Barbie-and-Ken bodies of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; makes them  look beautiful and noble. In addition, the scenery in the movie is  breathtaking--the interior of the castle, the fields in which Maleficent  and the prince do battle, and the forest where Aurora first meets  Philip.<p>A baby princess is born to a kindly king and queen, who invite  hundreds to the celebration--including three fairies to bestow blessings on  the baby. But the evil witch Maleficent shows up as well--and curses baby  Aurora with death on her sixteenth birthday. But the third fairy is able to  soften the curse into sleep until a kiss wakens her. <p>And for added  safety, the fairies take Aurora, under the name &quot;Briar Rose&quot; out  to the forest to raise her. All goes smoothly until she falls in love with  a young man in the forest, but is told that she is betrothed to Prince  Philip. Guess who the young man is.<p>As her sixteenth birthday approaches,  the fairies bring Briar Rose back to the castle--only to discover that  they're delivering her straight into Maleficent's grasp.<p>Maleficent still  holds the record for best Disney villain--we don't need any explanation for  her evil works, except that she's pure evil! In case the horns on her cap  didn't tip you off! Her acts of evil towards the king and queen, Aurora and  Philip would be acceptable in an adult movie. That's how amazing she is as  a villainess, rather than the blustering morons that Disney has had  recently. She's not obvious--and watch out for her casual jaunts through  her ghastly castle!<p>Aurora was a big improvement on &quot;Snow  White&quot;--the only reason she doesn't decide her own destiny is because  she's royal. And Philip is the perfect match for her--I was in love with  him when I was a kid. He's strong, masculine, funny, and adventurous, and  the final battle with Maleficent is breathtaking in its dark  violence.<p>The music is amazing: the beautiful &quot;Once Upon a  Dream&quot; is a unique song, one that I still remember even though it's  been five years since I last watched the video.<p>And thankfully, the humor  is still sophisticated. Nowhere are the screaming gross-out antics of Timon  and Pumbaa. One of the sweetest scenes in the movie is when the three  fairies get into a massive, impressive fight over cakes and dresses for  Aurora's birthday, one that lasts until the end. <p>A beautiful, dark,  bright movie that adds pizzazz to an old favorite, this movie is a must-see  for any kids who ever dreamed a fairy tale.</p></body></html>

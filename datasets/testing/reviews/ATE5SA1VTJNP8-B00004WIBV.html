<meta name="summary" content="Excellent movie and DVD!"></head><body><p>This was a really cool flick! It actually was kind of creepy. The acting by Depp,Walken,Jones, Ricci was all great, and of course Burton's unique style of directing made for a visually stunning film as well. The DVD had all the cool extras that I like, such as the making of the film, which incedentally I found mindblowing to learn that they actually designed each tree that you see in the western woods individually. Ths story is obviously about the headless horseman. It shows his origens, I won't give away the ending, just see it for yourself!</p></body></html>

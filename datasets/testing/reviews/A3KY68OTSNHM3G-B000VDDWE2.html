<meta name="summary" content="The Dawn of a New Ice Age"></head><body><p>Dennis Quaid stars as climatologist Jack Hall in this spectacular thriller about the effects of global warming on the Earth.  Due to the rapid warming, the polar ice caps begin to split, hail the size of softballs begins to fall in Tokyo, huge tornadoes are spawned over Los Angeles, and a tidal wave with waves as high as the Statue of Liberty engulf New York City.  The after-effects of the storms are perhaps the most catastrophic, as temperature drops of as much as ten degrees per second occur, instantly freezing anyone who ventures outside.<br /><br />Jack's son Sam, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is in New York City participating in a scholastic competition when the weather starts to change.  Cut off from escape, Sam and a band of fellow survivors take refuge from the tidal wave and ensuing temperature drops and snowfall inside the New York public library.  They survive by burning books inside an old fireplace and eating chips and candy from vending machines.  But, with nowhere to go and no one to rescue them, will they survive or will they all perish from the bitter cold?  Will Jack make it to rescue his son before its too late?  What will become of the people in the southern United States who were evacuated to Mexico?<br /><br />I'm a big fan of special effects in movies, and this film has some of the best effects I've ever seen before.  Perhaps the best scene of the film is the formation of the tidal wave that slams into New York City.  Watching this wave form and ultimately engulf the Statue of Liberty, which stands well over 800 feet tall, was one of the high points in the movie for me.  The tornado sequences over Los Angeles, and the opening scenes of the fissure cracks at the poles were excellent as well.  Dennis Quaid , Jake Gyllenhaal, and the rest of the cast give top notch performances.  I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  The special effects will blow you away, and the thrilling story will keep you captivated throughout.</p></body></html>

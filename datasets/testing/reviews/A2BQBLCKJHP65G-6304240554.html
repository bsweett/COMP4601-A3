<meta name="summary" content="Looking Back At The Cinematic Effect Of Dawn Of The Dead"></head><body><p>Even though George Romero is credited with the<br />birth of the modern-day zombie in 1968, it's real debut<br />can go all the way back to 1932 with White Zombie<br />featuring Bela Lugosi. But I think what Romero<br />introduced that got him the credit was the zombie's<br />cannibalistic need of living parts, be it flesh or brains<br />along with the disease factor of if you get bitten alive<br />you'll end up walking dead like them. It also didn't<br />hurt to be one of the first films to have a multi-racial<br />cast featuring an African-American as group leader<br />which of course in '68 was pretty rare indeed. Yeah,<br />Night Of The Living Dead deserves this honor even if<br />technically it isn't quite true.<br /><br />But it wasn't until almost ten years later Romero<br />really put the zombie in pop-culture with the much<br />heralded Dawn Of The Dead in 1978. This film took<br />the trapped survivor scenerio of NOTLD up a notch by<br />putting in the more modern day setting of a typical<br />American pleasure, the indoor shopping mall. DOTD,<br />while offering pretty much the same living character<br />design, this time made the zombies more in number,<br />appearance, and graphic actions. It was this film with<br />instead of it's shades of gray now bursting in bloody<br />color that put the Zombies on the map permanently.<br />It's a great film that not only fleshes out the characters<br />at a good pace (though at times it does seem a little<br />too detailed in that department), but truly shown that<br />zombism has no cultural bounds. Not only did the Americans<br />just eat up this new genre, but on the opposite side of the world, Europeans did so even more, especially the film-making members of Italy.<br /><br />When Romero wanted his film to be presented over there,<br />he enlisted the help of Italian filmaker Dario Argento to<br />re-edit it for Italian audiences. Argento slimed down bits<br />of comedy & slower dialouge, gave it a faster soundtrack, and<br />changed it's name to Zombi. This may have been one of the<br />most important effects this film ever could of have. Not only was the film an even bigger success overseas, but it inspired many<br />Italian filmmakers to continue what Romero started. Before<br />Romero even thought of his 1985 third installment Day Of The Dead, Italian director Lucio Fulci brought a year later his unofficial (yet honored by Romero himself) sequel called Zombi 2. This film showed what the worldwide Zombie outbreak was doing half a world away from that mall. But this time the zombies were far more graphic and the gore and pacing were turned up by leaps & bounds. It was this film along with Dawn that gaveway for the Italian Zombie craze of the 1980's. Like how the Italians created their own successful version of the classic American Western ten years earlier, they once again did it but with our Zombies. What followed was a barrage of great Zombie films that never seemed to be carbon copies of Romero's then two classics, but new ways of defining the genre. Unfortunately by '85 with Day Of The Dead, Romero seemed to be beaten at his own game by them with Day's lackluster audience response (though over time, it in itself has become the classic it deserves). But all of this couldn't of happened without Romero & his original update of Dawn Of The Dead. It was that film that launched a thousand ships filled with the living dead.<br /><br />...And now a review of the 2004 DVD Ultimate Edition Anchor Bay release:<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is one of the most exhaustive releases any one film has ever received, and it's completely deserved. The film that started the Zombie craze that still lives to this day, gets an amazing FOUR disc set that shows you every little piece of it's history and formations. With this set you get THREE different versions of the film: the US theatrical, the extended Directors Cut, and the rare Dario Argento European cut known as Zombi. Each version has it's own merit and differences that never, ever feels like release overkill. All has been fully remastered to the hilt, with different commentaries for each equally entertaining (though it would have been nice to have an Argento one for the European cut). No lack of movie presentation here, you get it all.<br /><br />Extras? Wow, you got them! Documentaries, commercials, trailers, stills, photos, home movies, easter eggs, Jeez this thing is packed! In fact, I couldn't even think of what it's missing. All enclosed in a great box-set with wonderful artwork and an errie front cover to boot. C'mon, it even comes with a comic book, for cryin' out loud! Now I know Anchor Bay/Starz is known for double-dipping their audience, but it has never been as necessary as this one. If you own any of their previous releases, sell them and add it to the pot to get this. Something of this quality to me has only been seen for a franchise, not a single film release, so you can tell just how impressive this set is. So if you're a fan of any level to the original Dawn Of The Dead, or the genre of Zombies itself, your collection is NOT complete till you own this. I personally have never given a DVD release a full 10 before, and I feel once you get this you might do the same.</p></body></html>

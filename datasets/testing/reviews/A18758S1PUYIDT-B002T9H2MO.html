<meta name="summary" content="A psychological character study"></head><body><p>This is an interesting and thoughtful character study of a lonely man on a lunar mining outpost.  He finds out after a while that.....spoilers ahead...............<br /><br />he is simply one in a long line of clones of the original Sam Bell, who apparently died some time ago.  The clones are of course not supposed to be aware that they are clones, nor are they to know that there are many more just like them.  This is the central conflict.<br /><br />More could have been done with the emotional complications that would ensue if any of us discovered multiple copies of ourselves. We would feel threatened and frightened.  Sam shows some of this, though not quite enough.<br />Still, this is a fascinating look at loneliness and corporate exploitation.</p></body></html>

It had a decent budget and an attractive, experienced cast.  It had a creepy setting and a good set up.  What it didn't have was a credible script or tight execution.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage plays a patrolman who, after a horrific traffic accident, takes some time off from work, but is soon summoned by his ex-fiance to come to "Summerisle," a mysterious island off of the Washington State coast because she needs help in finding her daughter who has disappeared.  Cage, while still hurting from their long ago breakup, comes to her aid.  The island is privately owned, and on the surface appears to be a commune of some sort...dedicated to living off the land in a way which reminds me a lot of the village in M. Night Shymalan's THE VILLAGE...a pseudo-puritan society.  Turns out, on Summersisle, the women run things and the men are mute servants.  And the little girl who has disappeared has almost certainly been appropriated for a mysterious ritual of some sort that might involve human sacrifice.<br /><br />The plot elements are ridiculous but could have been fun.  When we go to see a horror/suspense movie, we're ready to suspend some disbelief and have fun.  See where the filmmakers want to take us.<br /><br />Sadly, THE WICKER MAN doesn't even earn a modest suspension of that disbelief.  Primarily because Nicholas Cage's "experienced cop" doesn't even ask the most basic questions.  He'll go up to some mysterious old woman, ask a question, get a vague response and then just go on his way.  No follow up questions.  Not even the questions any halfwit would ask.  He's an investigator who would NEVER solve a single darn crime in the real-world.  He's almost laughably inept.  And Cage gives one of his weaker performances.  When he's on, his quirks make for great entertainment (ADAPTATION, MATCHSTICK MEN).  When he turns off the ticks and plays more normal (WORLD TRADE CENTER) he can be restrained.  In this film, we get the worst of both worlds.  His character will burst into a rage for no reason...then become soft-spoken and "sensitive."  But most importantly, he doesn't do believable things for someone in his situation.  And best of all, at one point, he puts on a bear suit!  It almost makes sense that he does so...but after 80 minutes of bad-movie...it's just so funny.<br /><br />I have never seen the original WICKER MAN...although I guess I will now to see what all the fuss was about.  But this movie is pretty bad.  It has gorgeous scenery.  It has Eileen Brennan nicely chewing the scenery (and looking quite lovely) and it's always great to see Frances Conroy from SIX FEET UNDER.  It has a modest twist ending.  But it has no emotional impact, seems to take much longer than its 97 minute running time, and is terribly frustrating.  If you must see it, at least wait for the DVD...which you must only rent, not buy.  It's PG-13 and that seems about right.</p></body></html>

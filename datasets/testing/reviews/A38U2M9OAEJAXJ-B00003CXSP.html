When word got out that &quot;Hannibal&quot; was going to be filmed, expectations were high, and critics gave the movie no love, often comparing it unfairly to the far better &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; But &quot;Hannibal,&quot; as a film by itself, is a decent picture, and should be watched with an open mind, flaws and all. Julianne Moore gave a great performance as Clarice Starling, although Anthony Hopkins verged on camp during his revisited role as Hannibal Lecter. Some of the scenes were so outrageously graphic, it was often hard to take them seriously and realize the full horror of Lecter's actions. But for all its shortcomings, &quot;Hannibal&quot; the DVD is a worthy purchase because MGM gave this disc such a deluxe treatment. The picture and sound are top-notch, while the features on the second disc inlcude multiple angle shots, documentaries, and other goodies. So my advice is this: if you hated &quot;Hannibal,&quot; then you're not going to find much to like here. But those who, like myself, found the film flawed but still entertaining should grab this DVD: it's among the best MGM has ever produced. It's clear that the studio put a lot a love into its making.</p></body></html>

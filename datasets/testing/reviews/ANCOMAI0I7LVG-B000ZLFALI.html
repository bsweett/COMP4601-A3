That is what `Across the Universe' brings to the table.  It doesn't always work and yet it is never less than intriguing.<br /><br />Using Beatles songs as jump off narratives for plot shifts, Taymor wraps her `Shakespearian' tale around a poor artist from Liverpool who travels to America and falls in love with a girl out of his league and mourning the loss of her beloved (who died in the war).  Together they make an odd pair, born more out of division than unity (their style, taste and political aspirations all stem from separate places) and yet the stars have aligned and shown them the light.  Musically, it doesn't always work.  It seems a little too all over the place and other than Sturgess and the dynamic Dana Fuchs, the vocals don't always deliver the goods.<br /><br />That said, it is a lovely looking film (the art direction is stunning and those costumes are spot on) and it has a central flow that keeps one glued, but it doesn't always make it's point quite how it wants to, and the interwoven storylines (especially concerning Prudence and Sadie) don't add anything to the film...in fact they tend to take away.  Taymor has an issue with overthinking her productions.  She creates truly grandiose looking vehicles (you can add this in with `Titus' as one of the prettiest feature films in recent memory) and yet they are hollow, forgettable almost.  She hasn't figured out how to incorporate her obvious talent for window-dressing into a film that has substance.  Oh, and the special effects here are somewhat atrocious.  She tries to tamper with Baz's insane editing and fast paced musicality with one of the earlier numbers and it comes across messy and childish.<br /><br />It had promise, but overall `Across the Universe' falls flat.</p></body></html>

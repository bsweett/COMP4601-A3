<meta name="summary" content="A James Bond movie with a female lead character"></head><body><p>- It's a James Bond movie with a female lead character.<br /><br />- It has some exciting action scenes but it's so implausible because of Angelina's small body. For example, the scene where Salt jumped over the rail of staircase and choked a bad guy with her handcuffs. So, I watched it with a bucket of salt!<br /><br />- The pace is fast.<br /><br />- The majority of the film is predictable.<br /><br />- In short, it's worth watching once.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Horror Fan's Horror Movie, A Not-So-Subtle Classic!"></head><body><p>I can't believe how scary this movie is.  The effects are reflective of the small budget.  The acting is over the top.  It is utterly unbelievable.  And I love every minute of it.  Bruce Campbell as the reluctant hero, Ash,  is a staple of any horror fan's diet.  Every movie in this trilogy is  revered by any true horror fan.  A cabin in the woods, a book bound in  human flesh capable of bringing back the dead, and the words for the  incantations recorded for posterity only to be played back by unwitting  college kids.  Sam Raimi did a good thing with this and the subsequent 2  movies in this trilogy.  He reminded horror fans that big budgets don't  always translate into good movies.  He reminded us that we can be scared by  atmosphere alone.  And he showed us that when it comes to demons, the  messier the death, the better.  The Evil Dead is a horror fan's horror  movie, a not-so-subtle classic that deserves a place in every true horror  fan's heart.</p></body></html>

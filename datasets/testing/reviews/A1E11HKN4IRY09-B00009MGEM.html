<meta name="summary" content="Should only be shown in ROB ZOMBIE's house."></head><body><p>Pretty much unwatchable.  Loud, silly, and filmed in that amateurish music video style that is becoming so utterly common that it should have a genre of it's own, HOUSE OF 1K CORPSES was made by rocker ROB ZOMBIE obviously for ROB ZOMBIE.  All shlock, no shock and certainly not scary, skip this hoaky hommage to 70's horror movies because it just doesn't work.  Watch the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE again and revell in a more accurate view of horror in the 70's.</p></body></html>

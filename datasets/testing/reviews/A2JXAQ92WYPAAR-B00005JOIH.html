<meta name="summary" content="Justifying Revenge"></head><body><p>We have gotten awfully used to the defense of inaction in this country. From Kindergarten on, we are told to turn the other cheek, tell the teacher, sticks and stones... blah, blah, blah. Here, however, is another take on this dilemma, one terribly relevant, it would seem, in this time of arbitrary killings, defended by grinning thugs. We can wring our collective hands or we can act. This film takes on this subject in a time when America's revenge genre, the Western, has gone out of fashion. "Munich" really is "The Unforgiven" set in Europe. The killers are hunted down and killed in return. It's more or less as simple as that, but here one is asked to identify with the assassins and to ask oneself if it would be as easy as it may have seemed, in so many movies where the good guys catch up with the bad guys. It's a film built around an ethical issue, a real issue, it seems to me. The film is not fully satisfying, but it is hard to say why. The acting is fantastic. I came away thinking the ending was weak. The entire sequence is New York seemed soft and sentimental suddenly and out of keeping with the film. The screen play by Kushner has other weaknesses. For example, I had trouble accepting that these guys would be so amateurish. Each killing is botched, which, were the assassins American, would seem believable but, given that they are Israeli, the finest intelligence units the world, it seemed somehow contrived. The setting is great, the subject matter thankfully adult, and it is finally a political film, which is a rare and fine thing.</p></body></html>

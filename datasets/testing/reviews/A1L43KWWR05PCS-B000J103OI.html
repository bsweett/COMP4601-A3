<meta name="summary" content="TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE..."></head><body><p>This is the film adaptation of a best selling novel of the same name by Lauren Weisberg. My daughter, who loved the book, was home visiting and suggested that we rent the film. We did so and really enjoyed it. The film is a tightly scripted, well-directed one with excellent performances.<br /><br />The story turns around an aspiring journalist, Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who lives with her hunky boyfriend, Nate (Adrien Grenier), an aspiring chef. Having just graduated from college, Andrea is looking for a job and improbably gets one working for a top notch fashion magazine. Her job is to be second assistant to the Editor-in Chief herself, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), a veritable dragon lady before whom everyone kowtows. It is a job for which many would give their eyeteeth to have. Andrea, however, sees it just as a way station stop to becoming a legitimate journalist, as she is not at all interested in fashion, as evidence by the way she dresses.  Meanwhile, for Emily (Emily Blunt), the catty and acerbic newly promoted first assistant that lives in fear of Miranda Priestly, her job is her life.<br /><br />Thrust into the fashion maelstrom and thought of  as a size six fatty by all the size zeros with which she works, Andrea begins to change as the perks that go along with working for such a powerhouse fashion rag become apparent. The magazine's stylist (Stanley Tucci) ultimately helps Andrea pull together a look that serves to quell all criticism about her fashion sense.  This affects the way she dresses and, ultimately, the way she acts, as she starts emulating, to some degree, the dragon lady herself.  Moreover, the suave, sexy, and sophisticated Christian (Simon Baker), who is a serious and successful writer, sweeps Andrea off her feet.  As her relationships with her boyfriend and friends start to head south due to Andrea's absorption with her career, Andrea gets a wake-up call. The only question is whether she will answer it.<br /><br />Ms. Hathaway give a coltish and engaging performance as our erstwhile journalist, and Adrien Grenier is appealing as her heart stoppingly hunky, personal chef. Christian Baker is dead sexy as the serious writer who has designs on Andrea. Stanley Tucci gives a strong performance as the stylist who helps Andrea overcome her fashion faux pas. Emily Blunt is terrific as the harried first assistant.  The standout, however, is Meryl Streep. Her coolly understated, low key performance as the ruthless and powerful Miranda Priestly gives conviction to the adage that less is more.  Her very whisper commands attention, as her performance is that powerful and should not be missed by anyone who enjoys top notch acting.  The film leaves little doubt as to why Meryl Streep merited an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good special effects but the predictable plot put me to sleep."></head><body><p>Saw this 1984 film on Netflix.  I had never seen it before.  Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a cyborg from the future who is not human.  His mission is to kill a young woman (Linda Hamilton) because these creatures are going to take over the world but the son she will bear in the future will foil their plans.  However, Michael Biehn, who also comes from the future but is human is out to stop all this and save the world.<br /><br />What follows are a lot of chase scenes, guns, explosions and other predictable special effects that were available to 1984 audiences.  This fight doesn't seem fair at first because the cyborg is not human and can grow new body parts when necessary.  However there is no doubt how it will all turn out.<br /><br />The plot is simple, actually too simple for me.  Once I figured it out I fell asleep and awoke just once in a while to the sound of explosions.  I guess I'm just not into this kind of film.  But I'm glad I tried to watch it just to check it out.</p></body></html>

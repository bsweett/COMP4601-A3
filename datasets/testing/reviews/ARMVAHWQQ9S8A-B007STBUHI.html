Had a little drink about an hour ago, and it went right to my head"></head><body><p>I was reluctant to watch "Jaws" at first, due to the fact that most movies made prior to the nineties are pure cheese and corn.  I was happily surprised with Jaws, however, which was consistently entertaining.  The characters were likable and the dialogue was rich and humorous, heavy in sea-captain lingo.  Much of the dialogue may be hard to understand without a prior understanding of marine life, but all in all it's an easy movie to follow.<br /><br />There was more gore in the movie than I expected, but it made everything realistic.  Many of the scenes from this movie have, rightfully, become famous and have been repeated (and/or parodied) many times.  This movie does everything it's supposed to.  You root for the good guys, and boo the shark (and the mayor).<br /><br />On a side note, the Amazon Editorial Review got a significant detail wrong:  They mistakenly think the movie takes place is Long Island, but it truly occurs in Massachusetts, close to Boston.  The town is called Amity Island and it takes place by the water, so it's easy to see how that can be confused, but there are multiple references to living by Boston in the movie and how badly the family misses New York.<br /><br />All in all, the three main characters are different, memorable, likable, and have everything that it takes to make a trio of flawed but stalwart heroes.  Bravo.<br /><br />9/10</p></body></html>

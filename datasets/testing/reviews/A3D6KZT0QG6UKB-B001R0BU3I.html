<meta name="summary" content="Solidly Mediocre"></head><body><p>This is another movie like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7WGOW">The Kingdom (Widescreen Edition)</a> where Hollywood feels the need to make up for their old easy Arab terrorist stereotypes with great swaths of verbiage about how Islam is peaceful and decent and real muslims wouldn't become terrorists, blah blah. Just kidding about True Lies and Gene Simmons. One wonders when rich freelance bad guys who want to rob Fort Knox will get their due.<br /><br />The main problem with this movie is that you're supposed to believe that Don Cheadle is a rogue agent turned terrorist instead of a double agent that's infiltrating the terrorist organization. That bit of fluff doesn't hold up for a second (even if the entire marketing campaign wasn't set to SPOILER ALERT) and Cheadle is doing his blandly virtuous role throughout. I miss the Cheadle that played Mouse in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767818075">Devil in a Blue Dress</a>. Without much tension on the Cheadle side, Guy Pearce has to do the heavy lifting but he's saddled with a Southern accent that goes between genuine and grating as all hell and a back story about being a Preacher's Son who studied Arabic in college.<br /><br />And every 5 minutes someone stops to say that Islam is peaceful. Really. Whether you got Cheadle preaching at his terrorist friends or Guy Pearce talking about the problems with profiling Arabs, there's the speechifying. Good intentions make for deadly dull viewing and this is a movie brimming with good intentions. The only part that I liked was the fact that there's no Big Reveal where Guy Pearce's sidekick turns out to be the FBI mole. Of course, there's no big reveal concerning that FBI mole so it's probably somewhere on the cutting room floor.</p></body></html>

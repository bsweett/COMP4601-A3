<meta name="summary" content="This Film is a Blast!"></head><body><p>I am a fan of Roland Emmerich's films. This one is almost as good as Independence Day! I saw this in the theaters, and when it came to DVD I snatched it right away.<br /><br />This movie is full of great action/disaster scenes. It also has a surprisingly good score by Harold Klauser, "a composer who is not that well known." I am used to hearing David Arnold scores on Emmerich's movies, but Klauser has proven himself to be a worthy oppenent. Also, Dennis Quaid does a wonderful job portraying the scientists who nobody believes. In fact, all the actors do a splendid job!<br /><br />A must see for action lovers!</p></body></html>

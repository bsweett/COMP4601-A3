"I Robot" is a suprisingly great movie and among the best that Will Smith has done in recent years.<br /><br /> Set in Chicago around the summer of 2035 (I'll be 52 then), a scientist named Doctor Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) is found dead after going through an office window and falling to his death in the lobby of the corporate headquarters. An agent who is highly technophobic (spiteful of advanced technology, preferring 'old-fashioned' lifestyles) decides to find out who commited the crime and believes that the perpetrator of the crime was in fact one of the 'modern' robots that was designed by Lanning.<br /><br /> The acting is absolutely great in this movie. Although I'm skeptical of Chicago looking like that at that point, I loved the way that they made Chicago look in this time frame with the John Hancock and Sears Towers still standing out despite the looming heights of the corporate headquarters. The look also was great to see with the 'L' trains although I'm not too sure about the 'expressway' in relation to the Sears Tower. If it was the Eisenhower Expressway in there, it would be farther south unless they upgraded Lake or Madison Avenues into elevated expressways. Other than that, the look of CHicago in 2035 is great!<br /><br /> The special effects are excellent and not too overdone. While not necessarily a 'thinker's movie, "I Robot" is sometimes unsettling in the way it makes one wonder if robot technology advances to the point that even they can think independently in the same patterns that the human brain can although the human brain is FAR too complex to duplicate in even todays most advanced technology.<br /><br /> Anyhow, "I Robot" is a great summer popcorn flick and is definately a movie worth checking out, if not buying. I guarantee it. Well done Will! I look forward to more movies from you man! :)</p></body></html>

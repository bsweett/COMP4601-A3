<meta name="summary" content="A really well done thriller/serial Killer Movie"></head><body><p>Kevin Costner plays a well off business man at the top of his game, awarded Man of the Year in the business world, loving wife and daughter, living the good life.  Little does the world know that he has a constant companion with him that only he can see, and a closet full of secrets that none could imagine.  Surrounded by an excellent cast including Demi Moore, Dane Cook and William Hurt, this movie is slightly predictable, but a couple of nice twists at the end that will leave you speechless. Only one small flaw in it at the end, careless of the Mr. Brooks Character, but doesn't change the ending.  Very graphic with the gore though, not one for the family, but one worth buying and watching again and again.</p></body></html>

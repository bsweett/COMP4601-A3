<meta name="summary" content="ALMOST HARD TO SWALLOW BUT...."></head><body><p>...one can't deny the ferocious intensity of this indie thriller.  Ellen Page is nothing short of brilliant as Hayley, a young girl who meets a charming photographer on an internet chat line.  Played by Patrick Wilson, this charming but creepy young man takes Hayley home with him, and what could have been a film about pedophilia becomes a disturbing tale of revenge.  Page is convinced Wilson is a pedophile and responsible for the disappearance of a young girl.  She imprisons him in his home and vows to castrate him for his crimes.<br /><br />What makes the film so uncomfortable at times is the sympathy one can't help feel for Wilson and how calm Page is in her mental torture of the supposed pedophile.  Is he guilty?  Is she insane?<br /><br />The ending is a surprising one, but the real reason this movie works is the brilliant work of Page and Wilson in a basically two character movie.  Sandra Oh does show up as Wilson's neighbor but its a cameo performance for sure.<br /><br />A good if disturbing movie.</p></body></html>

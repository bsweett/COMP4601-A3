The Unrated version is a marked improvement over the choppy theatrical version of the film that we saw in theaters with better pacing and giving us a better understanding of the characters in the film (it's also a bit more graphic as well). Why studios continue to listen to preview audiences when deciding to re-editing a film (I can think of many films that later were seen as classics that suffered at the hands of studios..."Blade Runner" anyone?)in a seamlessly branched edition with both versions. "The Wolf Man" looks marvelous with a sharp, detailed looking transfer.<br /><br />Be aware however that I noticed a drop out in the sound at around the 1:30 mark it could be an isolated glitch but you may want to check your copy (and no it wasn't related to the player nor any dirt or debris on the disc as it happened at exactly the same spot. Could be something in the dual layer of the BD disc though). I didn't notice any other glitches and/or problems.<br /><br />Director Joe Johnston creates an atmospheric film with terrific production values. While there are elements that don't work in the film (Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt have zero chemistry both do give good performances although Del Toro at times seems a bit miscast to me). The action sequences particularly the sequence set at an asylum in London are terrifically staged and directed. Is the film flawed? Most certainly although the "Director's Cut" eliminates many of these flaws and "The Wolf Man" remains a gory entertaining movie.<br /><br />Actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro)returns home at the request of his brother's fiance to discover who or what mutilated and killed his brother. Long estranged from his father (Anthony Hopkins who chews the scenery quite ably), Talbot returns home reluctantly at first but becomes determined to find the creature stalking the locals. When Lawrence is attacked by the creature he becomes cursed becoming a monster when the full moon hangs high in the sky.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has quite a bit in the way of special features focusing on the visual effects, make up and thoughts behind remaking the 1940 film. Included as part of the package here is the ability to stream the original film via BD Live (it would have been nice if they had included it on Blu-ray as an extra here)and it looks quite good (here's hoping a BD version will arrive soon).<br /><br />"The Wolf Man" is QUITE gory and as well as being an atmospheric film. While I'm not sure if it is a "classic" it is an entertaining if flawed film and the "Unrated Director's Cut" is far superior to the theatrical version even if it is only 16 minutes longer.<br /><br />If in doubt, I'd suggest renting before buying.</p></body></html>

There was a great mix that went well with the story, making it enjoyable for adults as well as children. There are some PG-13 moments with very slight hints to 'reproduction', so parents will want to view it first and determine if it's age appropriate for their youngster. The story is a wonderful tale about a penguin that doesn't have a song in his voice because it's in his feet. If he can't find his own heart-song, how will he ever find a mate? The movie touches on environmental themes, references to being different and finding your own unique qualities, as well as introductions to other cultures. The music plays a key role and is very well woven into the screenplay. Overall, I thought it was very enjoyable and none of the issues the story was trying to highlight were 'preachy'. I'll watch it again and again.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

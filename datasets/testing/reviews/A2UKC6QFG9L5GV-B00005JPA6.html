<meta name="summary" content="FAIRY TALE IS JUST A CLOAK; LOOK DEEPER"></head><body><p>When I think theoretically about some films of mixed genres I can't come up with any excuses for them to exist, because - again theoretically - the idea itself seems absurd. But on the other hand when I try to recall some and primarily From Dusk Till Dawn comes to mind, I start thinking it's not a bad idea after all. So although you can call Pan's Labyrinth whatever you want - a fairy tale, a war drama, a fantasy or a Harry Potter for adults - it's neither of the above. This movie exists out of any genre and that's almost always a sign of a good picture.<br /><br />Ofelia comes along with her mother to a remote mountain village in the Northern Spain where mother's new husband is waiting for them - a sadistic captain Vidal who, after general Franco had taken over Spain, was directed to the rural fort to fight guerillas. In one of the nights Ofelia, who lives in her own imaginary world, meets Pan from a fairy tale who tells her she must accomplish three tasks so that the fairy tale kingdom he's from can go on.<br /><br />And so the action begins. Half of the film looks like real life where captain and his soldiers are tracking down guerillas in the woods and fighting them. Another half is Ofelia's adventures in the world that looks not so real. But who knows - you'll be waiting till the very end of the film to discover whether it was real or just a creation of Ofelia's imagination. So you have a salad of fantastic creatures, hidden underground world a la Alice in Wonderland, and cruel fights between captain's soldiers and partisans. But it only looks like salad from the first glance. When you take a closer look everything becomes pretty plain and clear with no fairy tale nonsense.<br /><br />The fairy tale part is rather dark and frightening. Ofelia comes across not very pleasant creatures and finds herself in places that are not very sweet. The episode with a child-eater who has eyes in his palms is pretty creepy and disturbing especially for a small girl to bear. But at certain point you start wondering: what is scarier - this fantastic stuff or events that surround Ofelia in "real" life? People are being tortured and killed around her, she has to see all kinds of atrocities that her stepfather commits and she has to live in this atmosphere of suffering and madness all the time. No surprise she choses a fairy tale evil. Here Guillermo Del Toro compares and shows us the difference between these two evils and comes to a conclusion that even the most intricate and sophisticated mind can't invent things that happen in real life. Real life evil, real life vice are more dreadful and more abysmal than anything we can ever imagine. Child's mind of Ofelia tries to escape the things she sees around, she seeks shelter in a fairy tale, but it turns out you can't run far...<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth is utterly violent and what's most disturbing all the violence is shown through the child's eyes - it's not shaded, not sugar-coated, it's the way it is - simple and cold-blooded. The way soldiers are being finished off with a shot in the head after a fight, the way people are tortured (no hard feelings - just to get information) makes you shiver, and I wonder what a child must feel observing all this. Pan and fairies are only an excuse here, this ain't no fairy tale. Pan's Labyrinth is a thoughtful and serious story of growing up and trying to stay sane in the madness of the world. It's one of the most interesting, bizarre, sad and magical pictures I've seen lately. Surely not to be missed.</p></body></html>

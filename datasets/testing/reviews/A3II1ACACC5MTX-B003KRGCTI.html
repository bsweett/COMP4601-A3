Do Amazon think I might be Benjamin Button and be growing younger, or perhaps I am testament to the education system that Wexford is producing very erudite and splenetic 12 years olds? I digress....<br /><br />"Can I tell you about the word of our Lord"?<br /><br />Is one phrase that thankfully that Eli managed to avoid. The following also does not appear..<br /><br />Washington "Can I interest you in a Watchtower?"<br />Oldman "No thanks, I'm quite happy with my hotel thank you".<br /><br />Its 30 years in the future, the bombs fell, the world ended, nuclear fire blossomed and the fire of the sun scorched the earth. The stunned survivors roamed shooting, gouging and murdering each other, civilisation fell, the wheels of industry stopped turning, and yet still, the roads in The Book of Eli are still in better condition than those we have in Wexford.<br /><br />The world was broken some 30 years previously when some sort of war occurred and probably destroyed the ozone layer causing the world to be flooded with UV light. In the short term, everybody got a lovely tan, but in the long term, everyone who managed not to live underground for a year died. A year?? Who on earth could live underground for an entire year?<br /><br />In the intervening years, the lazy good for nothing folk of Carnegie's town had done nothing at all to tidy up the place, it looked like a ruin, there's no excuse for living in a ruin, its sheer laziness.<br />Eli is wandering around the place lugging a Bible that he reads from lovingly every night, as he listens to his IPod, not you understand, one of those crappy ones that break down after 5 minutes, but one that lasts for 30 years, before he has to recharge it, perhaps it is solar powered or something? Tom Waits was actually tasked with recharging it during the film, but presumably resisted the temptation to load any of his own tunes onto it.<br />The other thing that everyone has is a supply of cool sunglasses, which is great. I don't know how they do it; I lose mine all the time.<br /><br />And the last thing you would probably want to see in the post apocalyptic world is some bloke with a Bible. I mean, thinking about all of the wars caused in the name of religion, the Inquisition, the Crusades, oppression of people and cleric abuse, an outbreak of organised religion would be the last thing I would like to see. And what is the big deal? The folk he meets in the town  could have the following conversation. Observe.<br /><br />Townsman - "Howdee stranger, what have you got there?"<br />Eli "I have a Bible".<br />Townsman "What's that all about then? What happens at the end?"<br />Eli - "Why, Revelations, Armageddon, the end of the world!!!"<br />Townsman (expansively indicating the post apocalyptic landscape) "Seen it already."<br /><br />Anyhoo, Carnegie (Gary Oldman) decides that the bible represents a handbook to dominate and oppress and entirely new market segment, and he might well have been right. You see, the survivors of the apocalypse had destroyed every other copy of the Bible in America, so this is the last one.  Even those Gideon ones. Oldman lives in a town centre hotel, he might like to have checked his bedside table, which would have been ironic if there was one there all the time.<br /><br />Oldman wants the Bible; Washington has a higher calling for it. Shenanigans ensue. There is some chopping, a bit of stabbing, some shooting.<br /><br />In the end, there is an ironic and moderately unexpected twist, which frankly on first viewing is really outstandingly daft, I mean mega daft, but the point of the film is faith, and so you have to take the silly twist on faith as well, which sort of makes it more bearable.<br /><br />I really rather liked the post apocalyptic setting of the film, its well done, the washed out colour and the utter devastation is nicely realised. Oldman and Washington are solid in their performances, the fight scenes are well realised without being graphic, for me, who loves the post apocalyptic genre, this was an enjoyable film, and recommended. Mad Max, it is not. More "Reasonable Max".</p></body></html>

The movie is (very) loosely based on both the truth, and the book of the same name.  It covers a Scottish doctor who falls for the charisma of Amin, and eventually serves as one of his closest advisors.  The backdrop is the history of Amin's consolidation of power in Uganda, and other events such as the expulsion of the Asian community and the famous highjacking at Entebbe.<br /><br />The movie (more specifically Whitaker) succeeds in showing the dualily of Amin - his good humor and charisma, as well as his raw evil.  It also shows the complexity of relations between Africa and the West in post-colonial Africa.  Certainly the West is not left with clean hands.</p></body></html>

Shockingly, the cinema was only just half full I would have said. I've only seen Jaws once, and that was many years ago, and my friend and me spent the entire time talking throughout it. And it was shown on TV. Hardly great quality. My mum loves the movie, and she owns the sequels, but I've just never got round to watching it.<br /><br />The print we watched wasn't the greatest quality. It was grainy, and jumpy at times, and one important bit was completely missing (the bit where the shark comes out the water for the meat, and Brody says "We'll need a bigger boat.") The famous line was kept in, but it completely skipped the shark, so one of the most important scares of the movie wasn't there. Disappointed, slightly, but the rest of the movie was still good.<br /><br />I am not going to go into the plot of Jaws. Duh, it's perfectly obvious. Yes, it was 1975, and it was a Steven Spielberg movie (I haven't seen many, I really need to educate myself), but it hasn't dated that badly. Not as badly as I was expecting. Brody, played by Roy Schneider, was excellent, as was the supporting cast, although I didn't know any of them. It did start off, in my opinion, like a really bad slasher movie, with the two teenagers stripping off, and going skinny dipping, but it did get better.<br /><br />The shots from the shark's view were really creepy. I think that's what made the film for me, as it would have ruined the film more, if the shark had been shown more than it was. There was only a couple of very brief glimpses here and there of the shark, towards the end it was shown more. It's good when horror etc movies do that, cos I do have the impression it ruins it otherwise. Predator for example, is a lot more scarier, than if we'd actually seen the Predator more. The thing with Jaws is it's scarier/creepier what you don't see - I tell you, my imagination was making up some awful images when Hooper was looking at the first girl's remains. Bleurgh.<br /><br />Jaws has held its own, against many other contendors/spoofs over the years, and has proved to be very successful. I wasn't even around (never mind thought of) when it was first released, and I enjoyed it. Jaws will always be loved by generations old and new. It shows with me.</p></body></html>

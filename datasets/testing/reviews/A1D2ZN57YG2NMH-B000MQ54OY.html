It is nothing like the other computer animated films that have been coming out, and is mostly a musical involving penguins and 80's music. Another interesting thing about this film is it's strong message on enviroment, extinction and other things like that, (maybe a bit odd for a childrens movie?) Overal though, this is some of the better family entertainment to come out, and that is why I give it four stars.</p></body></html>

Don't get me wrong, the long opening sequence was great but the film bogged down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation of WWII and the accompanying interminable dialogue (in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this. I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WWII film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of mostly subtitled dialogue.<br /><br />Well, I finally decided to give it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the "interminable dialogue (with subtitles)" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. I discovered that the drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.<br /><br />There ARE elements that bring to mind "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKNM4">The Dirty Dozen</a>", including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick in until the final act, but "Basterds" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.<br /><br />All great films have great characters. With "Basterds" we have the stunning M&eacute;lanie Laurent as the cinema proprietor, who drips with vengeance toward the Nazis; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Landa, who mercilessly hunts down Jews, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but entertaining and memorable, leader of the Basterds; and super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy.<br /><br />Tarantino is renown as a great modern director, and so it is. "Basterds" shines with confidence, style and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the roll-your-eyes "blockbuster" syndrome that plagues modern cinema.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="UNCLE SAM NEEDS YOU!"></head><body><p>Of course, this franchise could be twisted into an enlistment plug, since it applies mostly to testosterone pounding youth, and the odd freak of genetic misconsctucture, but really - even dear old 'tante Piero Pasolini would smirk and frown .... Jule Taymor might sniff at this since it reeks somewhat of "Titus" and aptly relflects out delightfully Axes of Evil times, ["Off with their heads!"] ; but what is next?  Hannibal vs Jigsaw?<br /><br />More pointed is the Great Gret Froebe "Assault in Broad Daylight" ~ a fave of my youth ....... "The List Of Adrian Messenger?" ......could make a great re-make.<br /><br />"Hostel" had more charm as well as eye-candy .... this one's passable I guess and will no doubt provide lots of wanking pleasure for the young.<br /><br />NOW , can anyone vaguely remember "Dr. Phibes" or "Theatrre of Terror" - dear, dear, how we try to reinvent ourselves ......?<br /><br />HOWEVER, I did like the 'hog-shredding' sequence .......YUM!</p></body></html>

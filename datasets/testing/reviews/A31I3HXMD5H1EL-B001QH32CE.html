<meta name="summary" content="An Indie Film with Style and Charm!"></head><body><p>While the tragic death of writer/director/co-star Adrienne Shelly has given "Waitress" a bittersweet quality, the film deserves to be appreciated on it's own merits, as a terrific romantic comedy/drama.<br /><br />A 'slice-of-life' tale of a waitress at a small-town diner with a gift for pie-making (Keri Russell, in the best performance in her career), the film offers a rich variety of supporting characters, from her quirky-but-lovable fellow waitresses (Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Shelly), her less-than-lovable husband (Jeremy Sisto, who gets her drunk and pregnant), the gynecologist (Nathan Fillion) who falls for her, and, best of all, the cantankerous yet funny owner of the caf&eacute; (81-year-old Andy Griffith, who DESERVES a 'Supporting Actor' Oscar for this role!)<br /><br />Wickedly funny (Russell's observations on her pregnancy are hilarious, and very true), and unafraid to portray issues like spousal abuse and infidelity, Shelly's script doesn't 'sugarcoat' life in and out of the diner, or ruin the ending by tying up all the romantic 'loose ends' neatly; while the finale is perhaps predictable, it is very satisfying, and will certainly bring a smile!<br /><br />"Waitress" is a film that will brighten your day, and become a welcome addition to your DVD collection...I highly recommend it!</p></body></html>

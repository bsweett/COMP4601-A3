I really do think that this movie (filmed in 1950) was truly ahead of its time, and had the spark, the intelligence, the biting wit, the terrific score, the fabulous dance numbers, and the stellar cast that remains timeless today.<br /><br />"Singin' in the Rain" takes a behind-the-scenes look at the silent film stars of the Roaring Twenties cinema, whose careers were put in possible jeopardy when "talking pictures" were first introduced.  Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) is a handsome, charismatic and talented Vaudvilian performer who took a leap into silent film.  His career as a man who spends film after film miming, overacting and mouthing romantic and heroic words behind a film score background are in trouble when a "talking picture" demo is presented at a Hollywood party.  His leading lady (Jean Hagan) happens to have a terrible voice that could never be transferrable to sound photos, no matter how beautiful she is.  Don also meets beautiful Kathy Seldon (nineteen year old Debbie Reynolds), a young woman and aspiring dancer who hesitates to admit her adoring love for him as an avid fan of his films.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many priceless scenes are in this film.  The humor is warm, genuine and very, very funny.  The musical numbers are first rate.  The "Make 'Em Laugh" number with co-star Donald O'Connor is physical comedy and agility at its best.  He was a brilliant dancer and comic.  If I listed all of the dance and singing numbers, I would need more room!  Please view this film with family, friends or anyone you know who enjoys comedy, music, dancing, and entertainment at its best.</p></body></html>

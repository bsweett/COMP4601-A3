The major difference between this and Spielberg's gem is that "Schindler's List" is more objective, and "The Pianist" is subjective.  In this film a rapport develops with Szpilman and you see the horror through his tired eyes. The direction is astounding, and I pity anyone who did not see this on the big screen. There are many shocking scenes, most of which happen so fast that they are indigestible before the next horrifiying sequence.  This may leave some people feeling cold, but the technical filmaking in this movie is superb.  Roman Polanski richly deserved the Oscar for Best Director. This is a moving film with many unnerving scenes that linger long after the lights have come up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's Vietnam."></head><body><p>Vietnam War has inspired many films, ranging from excellent to abominable.<br /><br />In my opinion there are three outstanding: Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" (1979), Oliver Stone's "Platoon" (1986) and Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" (1987). Each of them shows their director's personal approach to this dramatic and tragic war.<br /><br />Kubrick has constructed his film in two huge parts: Boots Camp and Vietnam.<br /><br />The first part is by far the best. The process to transform young "green" civilians into "hard killer" soldiers is shown in depth.<br /><br />The figure of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman emerges overshadowing everyone with his sadistic methods. He effectively erases all "civil" traits in his charges, straining them to the utmost limit of endurance. Some will resist, some will not. All will be changed into a different person.<br /><br />The second half is more conventional. Is a war movie with excellent production, photography and Kubrick's splendid choreographic deployment, but conventional nonetheless.<br /><br />Playacting has two outstanding performers: Lee Emery as Sgt. Hartman and Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt. Pyle. The rest of the cast is good and convincing.<br /><br />The music score, original from Vivian Kubrick and non-original from various authors, is very good and enhance the scenes they underline.<br /><br />The final scene with the Marines singing the theme from Mickey Mouse Club is chilling. The contrast between kid's music and devastated battleground is a synthesis of the inferno lived by those almost teenage soldiers.<br /><br />An interesting film for anyone interested in the historical period depicted.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

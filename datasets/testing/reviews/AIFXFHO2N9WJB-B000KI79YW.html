They are a group of people that many Presidents have trusted with their lives for many years, and for many more to come.  There has never been a traitorous agent in all the years the Secret Service has existed, until now.  At least that is the premise for the movie "The Sentinel", starring Keifer Sutherland and Michael Douglas.<br /><br />"The Sentinel" begins with the Secret Service dealing with the standard, every day threats that the President receives on his life.  But when a plot on the President's life appears to involve a traitorous Secret Service agent, and the evidence points to one of the most decorated agents in the service, Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas), this threat becomes anything but standard.  As two federal investigators (Keifer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are pursuing all the facts and zeroing in on the traitorous agent, the only thing Garrison, who knows he is being framed, can do is go on the run and try to prove his innocence by finding those responsible.<br /><br />Let me say that the premise of the movie is one of pure fiction, there has never been a traitor within the Secret Service, the men and women that serve in this job continue day in and day out to put their lives on the line to protect one man and his family no matter the cost.  With that being said, lets move on to my thoughts on the movie at hand.<br /><br />When I saw the trailers for this movie, I instantly wanted to see it.  For two reasons, 1) I was a fan of Keifer Sutherland's work on Fox's hit show "24", and 2) the story seemed intriguing and looked like it would be a really solid action movie, with a good mystery thrown into the mix.  Now that I've finally watched the movie, I have to say that I thought it was really well done, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  All of the actors did excellent jobs, Michael Douglas even surprised me with how physical he was for as old as he is.  Keifer Sutherland turned in a solid performance, though this role didn't test him much, since he was essentially playing his character Jack Bauer from "24".  Eva Longoria and Kim Basinger rounded out the main cast, and both managed to do very well with not a whole lot of screen time.  The story was very well put together, with plenty of suspense to keep things interesting, and the mystery element was a nice touch to shake things up a bit.  Although the final reveal of who was behind the whole thing wasn't all that big of a surprise for me, I had the character pegged fairly early on.  Even though I had a strong suspicion as to who was the traitor, that didn't bring the movie down for me at all.  This may have been helped by the amount of detail that was shown as to what the Secret Service must go through every day to ensure the safety of the President and his family, which was really interesting to witness.<br /><br />I'm sure after watching this movie that any President, past, present, or future, will be very appreciative of the loyal service provided by these good men and women, but they may also be a little suspicious that one of them may betray them someday.  It's a scary thought, but a realistic one, when you know someone else is holding your life and the lives of your loved one in their hands.<br /><br />"The Sentinel" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and sensuality.</p></body></html>

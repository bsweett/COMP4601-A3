Cammila Albertson, All Movie Guide<br /><br />When I came across this incredibly accurate quote I knew I had to convey it here.  I highly recommend seeking out the entire review for anyone who enjoys insightful writing.<br /><br />"The Fountain" moves along at a snail's pace throughout, but it is also frequently mesmerizing and thought-provoking.  I saw this in the theater with a handful of moviegoers, and by the end, the credits rolling, absolutely no one moved to get up and leave.  We all sat transfixed in thought by what we had just seen.  While I don't think this film is genius, it is beautiful to look at and experience if you have the patience for poetic, non-linear storytelling.  The acting is solid, and the production value is pristine and often gorgeous to behold.  Some day in the future I will be renting a DVD and glance over to find this film for sale as a used copy for under ten dollars and I will snatch it up without hesitation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="They managed to do a very good job"></head><body><p>The directors and production staff took what could have been just any bad sequel and give it a life of its own.  They managed to turn what could have been a shadow of the first movie into a run little chase movie in its own right.  It was also interesting that they divided the movie into a 28 days/28 weeks later timeline (however briefly) to make the audience understand that the infection was happening in other parts of the country.<br /><br />All of those involved managed to do this by violating zombie movie rule #1 if a family member becomes contaminated destroy and dismember them immediately.  Of course if they did that we wouldn't have much of a movie.  You also can't ask yourself other inconvenient questions like "if you escaped rage infected Brittan why in Gods name would you go back?"<br /><br />The acting from the children was also surprising they in particular did a great job.<br /><br />Overall-If you have a fan of Zombie movies you need to see this.</p></body></html>

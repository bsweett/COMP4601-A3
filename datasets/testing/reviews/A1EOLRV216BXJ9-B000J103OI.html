<meta name="summary" content="Meryl Streep is amazing but the movie can have gone further"></head><body><p>Meryl Streep is surely the main draw to this movie. With one look, she shows her like or dislike. I especially like the way she pursed her lips, her admiration with one nod, two nods and the very rare smile she would give.<br /><br />Emily Blunt and Stanley Gucci are wonderful. Anne Hathaway looked so attractive and classy in the second half of the movie. Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway in the limo letting their thoughts out were well presented and proved that Anne Hathaway could act and impress. Yet the movie was not as great as I expected.<br /><br />Many a time the movie could not decide who the leading lady is. If it is Anne Hathaway, it failed because her performance was not consistent. It is one thing she had to display her lack in fashion sense, her ability to mix and match; it is quite another thing to deliberately dress her as bulky and unattractive. After all, she is a successful reporter at university with a brilliant resume. She can have brains as well as looks - casual as it may be. Second, if it is the fashion sense she lacks, the movie surely does not show much either. Compared with Project Runway or ANTM, fashion in this movie just focus on expensive clothes with not a single reference to fashion sense. Some dresses Anne Hathaway wore that were supposed to dazzle the room full of people did not really do her justice. Her other clothes at work were much more flattering. One can dress well without skyhigh price tags - just look at how good Anne Hathaway look in her leather jacket and jeans in the final scene.<br /><br />More importantly, the script could have been bolder. It could not bring out Anne Hathaway as an intelligent, beautiful person with a dream, at least not in the first part of the movie. Here, there is no Melanie Griffth in Working Girl; no Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Only Meryl Streep can deliver throughout the movie. The unfortunate thing it doesn't look like she is the leading lady, unlike Glenn Close in Dangerous Liasions.</p></body></html>

This film certainly suffices as society's ultimate artistic revenge on sexual predators and then some.<br /><br />Ellen Page gives the performance of a lifetime as a young woman named Hayley Stark, who for the most part remains a mystery throughout the film.  Luring Jeff (Patrick Wilson), an internet pervert who has a taste for photography and underage girls into a situation that seems ideal for a guy like this, the tables are turned are turned very quickly and predator becomes prey in a brutal fashion.  Hayley drops hints here and there of her absolute contempt for Jeff in the most subtle, teasing ways, but he has absolutely no way of knowing what's coming.<br /><br />Hayley has so many different motives that it gets hard to keep track of amidst all of Jeff's screaming: it seems that she wants to cause him the most grievous psychological and physical pain, remove his manhood and make him feel as docile and impotent as possible in the face of her considerable wrath, and also bring him face to with exactly what he is, allowing him no easy way out--not even death.  At least not immediately.  Her thoroughness and absolute ruthlessness lead one to wonder if Hayley herself is all that balanced.  At no point does she display any emotion but delight in his suffering and enthusiasm for finding new ways to cause it, which she does very well.  She mentions a model who disappeared named Donna Mauer, though when Jeff desperately probes the possibility of a friendship between the two she gives no definitive answer.  She may be anybody--a random sexual abuse victim who decided to go head hunting, indeed a friend of the young model he had a part in killing, or a psychopathic teenager looking for a legitimate moral cause as the the outlet for her rage.  In any case, one cannot sympathize with Jeff; Patrick Wilson portrays him realistically, as a con man who is hollow and perverse at the core.  At one point--while a perceived castration is taking place--Jeff relates a horrific from his childhood to Hayley.  Is it real, or something he made up to generate sympathy?  There's no way of telling.  At any rate, it does not phase Hayley one bit. The black humor here lies mostly in snippets of the dialogue, and you have to laugh loudly because otherwise you can't breathe.  A brilliant, remorseless film and one the best psychological horror films I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

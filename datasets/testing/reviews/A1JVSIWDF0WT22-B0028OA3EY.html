<meta name="summary" content="COULD HAVE, SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER"></head><body><p>This movie gets plenty of things right but the little kid in peril routine feels very, very old and tired. I also disliked the part of Lois' boyfriend who casually flies planes and lives in a house by the sea, too expensive looking for any non-millonaire (just like Margot Kidder's apartment in the original). The ending, featuring tons of CGI water felt way too artificial also.<br /><br />Still, Routh is perfect for the part and Spacey is great as Luthor. The flying effects make the ones in the old Superman feel rudimentary but after 28 years, that was to be expected.</p></body></html>

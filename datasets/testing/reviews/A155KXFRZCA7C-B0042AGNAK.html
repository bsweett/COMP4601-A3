<meta name="summary" content="A fun comics hero flick - More like 3 1/2 stars"></head><body><p>First of all, based on the original material - the graphic novel -, the film is actually executed very well. Fans of this genre won't be disappointed. Cage is cool as always and it was a delight to see Peter Fonda again, even though he's playing Satan. Also the modern-day ghost rider legend comes across well. As usual with Cage in the picture, there's a slight touch of Elvis in there. Technically, I don't think they could have done it any better, because the CGI effects are all in the right places and the ghost rider looks cool. Again, it's a fun comics hero flick with cheese nachos in one hand and a bucket of popcorn in the other ... and in a sense it's a thrill ride, but don't expect a super mega Hollywood movie blockbuster. Still, it's well worth watching it on a rainy/snowy Saturday afternoon.</p></body></html>

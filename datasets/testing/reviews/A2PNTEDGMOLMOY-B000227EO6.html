<meta name="summary" content="Vintage Tarantino!"></head><body><p>Tarantino's many, varied, and devoted fans had to get used to a slightly new Tarantino film in "Kill Bill, Vol. 1."  While Tarantino has always had a love for action sequences, most of his films were heavier on the dialogue than the fisticuffs.  Not so in "Vol. 1," which skewed much more towards the action side of the scale.  Sure, the trademark quips and pop-culture references were there, but the movie was defined by its over-the-top violence.<br /><br />"KB Vol. 2" represents a return to form for Tarantino (yes, it's an extension of the same film, but since had to pay two ticket prices, they are two films), with the dialogue once again returning to the forefront.  From the opening narrative, essentially working as the Chorus reintroducing the audience to the film after a long intermission, to several great scenes with the lethal Bill (David Carradine, in a performance that makes us wonder why we haven't seen much, much more of this guy), this film is a refreshing return to Tarantino's incredible pseudo-70's jargon and speechifying.<br /><br />Tarantino's fans are also always checking his films for references to other flicks.  Overt references include "The Searchers" in addition to homages to Tarantino's other movies, and they do not disappoint.  While Volume 1 was entertaining, I suspect that Volume 2 will receive more replays, if only because the tale is a bit more complex.<br /><br />The film does not have the audacious Japanese anime sequence used with such great effectiveness in Volume 1, but Tarantino includes an even more daring shot from inside a coffin as the occupant is buried alive (look for the exhumed corpse to play a little shadow-puppet game during the gravedigging scene).<br /><br />While Tarantino has said that he is interested in the idea of bringing back Vernita Green's daughter (from Volume 1) for a future revenge drama, I think the better chance for a spin-off character is the character who finishes the film without eyeballs.  The "Blind Swordsman" is one of the most beloved Japanese action heroes, and this character would be a perfect vehicle for Tarantino to give us his take on that legend.<br /><br />Top-notch performances abound in this film . . . Uma Thurman remains at the top of her game, the remaining survivors of DiVAS are pitch-perfect, and (again), David Carradine just plain steals the picture as an articulate, seductive, incredibly mean s.o.b.<br /><br />A must for fans of QT's previous efforts.  The extras on the DVD are pretty good, but you should buy this one for the film, not the bonus stuff.</p></body></html>

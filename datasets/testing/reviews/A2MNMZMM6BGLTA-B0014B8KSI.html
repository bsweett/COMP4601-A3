<meta name="summary" content="Good Clooney Flick"></head><body><p>I thought this was a pretty good movie. I am a huge George Clooney fan and I enjoyed the movie. But I must say, I didn't think it was as good as the hype. That said it was a compelling movie with great performances. It just wasn't 'great'. Tilda Swinton deserved her Oscar as she was excellent in her role.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Yes it's that good"></head><body><p>Now I'm not a huge Marvel comics fan, but i have to say. Having read some of the Iron Man comics, this movie is spot on. Robert Downey Jr. does an awsome job as Tony Stark, the good thing is , that this movie isn't afraid to be a comic book movie. From watching Stark build his suit in the cave, to all the interactions with the other characters. This is a fun movie</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent but underwhelming...for me anyway"></head><body><p>It's kind of strange to be reviewing Dawn of the Dead, the 2004 remake of the film of the same name originally done by George Romero. I've never actually seen the original (or any of them for that matter...well except that god-awful Land of the Dead though) so while most people are watching this with a sense of "how does it stack up to the original" while I'm just simply wondering if it's a good film or not. While I prefer my horror films foreboding and creepy, there's at least enough to recommend here, even if it's not exceptionally well-done from beginning to end.<br /><br />Nurse Ana is having a normal day at the hospital with some people mentioning cases of bites but nothing out of the ordinary. After coming home to her husband (or boyfriend?) and falling asleep, Ana wakes up to find her neighbor's kid with blood on her lips and takes a chunk out of Ana's neck. Ana escapes and eventually meets up with some survivors and they hide out in the mall. But these people willing to chomp on them are outside and eventually they'll either get in or they'll be a reason to try and get out.<br /><br />A lot of the older horror films and the films coming out of Asia are mainly concerned with developing a sense of dread and unease; a creepy atmosphere that's meant to make you feel uncomfortable. However, films like Hostel, the Saw series and others are mainly concerned with using as much disgusting stuff happening to their characters, thinking that's what'll scare people. Well it doesn't scare me (in fact, it's mainly a disgust factor, not a scare factor) but it's a bit more tense and action-packed than I'd expect from a horror film and it all starts with the "zombies". Instead of the slow, constipated walk of the old days, these zombies bolt to get to their prey and the film benefits from it.<br /><br />One of the more surprising things about the film is in its casting. Normally these films are littered with WB...sorry, CW veterans that end up getting munched/chopped up so it's weird to see indie favorite Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Pfifer, and Kim Poirier but they also manage to create likable characters. My one gripe is their defenses against the horde of undead after them. I mean, they're in a mall! Surely something must be available in these stores to wail on some zombies but they just make an armored van. Poo.<br /><br />It's a likable zombie film sure although I'm not a big fan of them. Some hate it, some love it while some find it merely entertaining so I'm kind of the last one: it didn't zap under 2 hours of my life but I didn't feel like I gained anything having watched it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not as Good as It Could Have Been"></head><body><p>This movie was this summer's TV rerun turned big screen flick.  I laughed.  I cringed.  I held my breath.  And, ultimately, I wished I'd listened to my two roommates who saw it opening night and hated it.  I thought it was okay, but there were other things I could have done with my time and money.<br /><br />While most people think the Communist organization KAOS died at the end of the cold war, it really went under ground.  So, too, did the US organization devoted to stopping it, CONTROL.  Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) is their top analyst, but he secretly desires to be an agent because they get all the glory.  His idol is Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson), not only the best, but a popular nice guy.  But The Chief (Alan Arkin) won't promote Max because his extremely detailed reports are critical to the success of the agency.<br /><br />All that changes when KAOS manages to attack CONTROL's main office.  With all their agents' identities exposed, Max has to team up with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to discover KAOS' plan.  But Agent 99 is less than thrilled to be working with an obvious rookie who is a bit of a spaz.  Can the two stay alive long enough for CONTOL to gain ... well, control?<br /><br />Fans of the original show will see glimpses of what they loved here, including some of the outdated gadgets that were cutting edge for the 60's.  Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway do a good job of making the characters their own while also recalling the originals.  And the rest of the cast is entertaining in their parts.<br /><br />But while the original was a sitcom, this is an action comedy.  The plot was fairly predictable, but I certainly got caught up in it and was holding my breath for the climax.<br /><br />There was still humor here.  Some of Max's antics were funny, but I found too much of it stemmed from bathroom humor and sexual situations for my tastes.  These were what earned the movie its well deserved PG-13.  The funniest bits went to the two gadget geeks, Lloyd and Bruce, and the agents who were reduced to being analysts.  If the movie had had more of them, I would have enjoyed it more.<br /><br />Then there's the message the film is trying to send out.  I think it might have been trying to skewer both sides of the political spectrum.  But if that's the case, it didn't work.  Instead, I was left confused about what it was trying to say.  I've got to say, however, that one line the villain has related to all this got the loudest laugh from me.<br /><br />I wish I enjoyed all of this movie because I enjoyed most of the film.  But for me, the sex jokes and bathroom humor made me wish I hadn't seen it.</p></body></html>

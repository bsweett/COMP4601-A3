<meta name="summary" content="Grittier, heavier and plenty more fun than before"></head><body><p>Successful sequel to the 1998 gore-fest, this time Blade (Snipes)teams up with an elite vampire squad called the Bloodpack (who are actually trained to kill him) to hunt down and eliminate a new and tougher breed of bloodsuckers called the Reapers (reminiscent of Max Schrek's portrayal of NOSFERATU) who attack both humans and vampires. More dark, gothic and grotesque than the original with even better visual effects and martial-arts scenes. Gabriel Beristain's atmospheric photography and Del Toro's focused direction also give this bloodthirsty film a real, horrific European feel. Flawless entertainment all the way.</p></body></html>

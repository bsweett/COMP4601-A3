<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie-faithful to book"></head><body><p>Marie Antoinette gives an honest portrayal of the French Queen from the time that she was just Archduchess Maria Antonia (the daughter of mighty Empress Maria Teresa) to the time shortly before she and her husband lost their heads in the French Revolution.<br /><br />Between the two time periods, Marie Antoinette led a very interesting life.  At first the Dauphine of France who wanted to have children, but whose husband would not make love to her so she substituted the longing with shopping, to the French Queen who was the mother of the future King of France who had an affair (and maybe child with) Swedish Count Axel von Ferson,  to a political prisoner and the Widow Capet.<br /><br />All in all a very well done movie with an interesting cast headed by Kirsten Dunst. Based on a book by Antonia Fraiser the movie is very faithful to the life of this interesting French Queen.</p></body></html>

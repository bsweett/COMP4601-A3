<meta name="summary" content="INDY FANS AROUND THE WORLD ARE WEEPING...  4.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Damn you, Steven Spielberg! You've ruined my day, hell, my whole damn week! Thanks a lot for f***ing up Indiana Jones, you dumbass! I was left shocked and horrified over this failure, I didn't want to believe this had actually happened. Why God, why? What did Dr. Jones do to deserve this?! This movie has hit the feared sequelitis, and it sucks. Now we'll never get the triumphant return Indy we were hoping for.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Year: 1957. When Dr. Jones is kidnapped and taken to a military base in Nevada by Russian soldiers, he is asked to find a box containing a body he had discovered ten years earlier. When it's found he makes a grand escape from the Russians. After his masterful escape he is investigated by the FBI and loses his teaching job. When he is on a train to leave for Europe, he is stopped by a Greaser kid calling himself Mud, who shows him a letter mailed to him by his kidnapped mother in Peru and a map to some long-lost city. During their search in Peru they discover an artifact called a Crystal Skull and must find the lost city and return it. They don't go without being pursued by the Russians and even meet up with some old friends (The return of Marion. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!). I know I shouldn't spoil the rest of the story, but I'm going to so you'll stay far away from this disaster. It turns out the Crystal Skull was from an alien and has the ability to hypnotize and control people (LAME!) and the crazy Russian chick wants that power. There, I ruined it for you, now don't ever watch it.<br />MUSIC: Oh my God! What the hell happened here?! Even the musical score is bad. How did this get messed up too? The music from the old movies was fantastic, but this film's music sucks...<br />ACTION SCENES: You know Indy for being in over-the-top action scenes, but this film contains perhaps the worst action scenes I've seen in film in years. They are covered in more cheese than a woman covered in water at a wet t-shirt contest. Sword fighting on two cars? Random Peruvian savages who attack people who enter graveyards using martial arts? Big ants that eat people? Indy being able to survive a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator that gets tossed like a mile away? Cheesy hand-to-hand fighting scenes? Dear God, it was like these scenes were scripted by Jean-Claude Van Damme himself. Just when you think Indy is about to rise back to former glory with action scenes and save this movie, he doesn't. Instead the action falls flat on its face and leaves you with your jaw dropped in horror. Good job, guys!! Some action scenes are cool, but those moments are rare and difficult to come by.<br />ACTING: Shia LaBeouf does a good job at playing a teenager as usual, but the rest of the cast just sucks and what makes it worse other than the fact Marion comes back, is the fact that the dialogue sucks (I don't care if Indy has daddy issues, move on dammit!). Marion sucks just as bad as she did in Raiders of the Lost Ark, not to mention she's not even good-looking anymore (At least her sexyness in that movie that made her more bearable). The story doesn't do anything special and it goes nowhere at all. It's rather stupid and there is very little that is enjoyable about it. Not mention it focuses less on action and traveling this time around.<br />OVERALL: Don't buy or rent. If you loved Indy's past excursions it will only bring pain. Go watch the original trilogy instead, or go play Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb (Xbox, Playstation 2), a game that should have been the movie instead. Come on, let's go play that game and watch the old trilogy to savor the memories and forget the pain, it'll make you feel better.<br />THE GOOD: Some action scenes are cool, Shia LaBeouf is fairly good actor in the movie.<br />THE BAD: The rest of the action scenes are incredibly cheesy, all the actors suck (Why the hell was Marion brought back?), crappy music, and an uninteresting story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Vampire Hunters!"></head><body><p>_Van Helsing_ is a decent action/horror movie about a monster hunter who must travel to Transylvania to meet Dracula and his minions.  If you enjoyed _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ you might enjoy this, because both feature the same Mr. Hyde character (who appears briefly at the beginning of this movie).  Kate Beckinsale, as always, is just swell as the Transylvanian princess.  The movie isn't anything heady but it is good fun.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

Despite my father's best efforts to keep me from seeing it when it released, I still got my chance and I still love this movie like no other in my collection. I've always been fascinated with serial killers and this movie fueled my fascination even further.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, I can only assume you've either been living in a cave this whole time, or you were too young to watch it when it came out. Either way, if you're one of the few people on this planet who has not yet watched it, go now. With so many reviews covering the plot, I won't go there, but if you like thrillers and serial killers and you've never seen this, you won't regret it. It's one you should own, not rent. It's timeless and amazing and it's worth it just for Hopkins' performance alone. Red Dragon and Hannibal were interesting and fun as well, but they have nothing on Silence of the Lambs. It will always stay in my top 10 favorites.</p></body></html>

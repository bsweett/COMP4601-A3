<meta name="summary" content="Well...this was unprecedented"></head><body><p>I'll say this right now: I don't like Zack Snyder as a director and I admit I outright laughed when I saw the trailer proclaming him as a "visionary director". No, the likes of Spielberg, Kurosawa, Scorsese and Kubrick are visionaries, Snyder is at best serviceable in making likable movies but completely off the mark as much as it succeeds. I am probably one of the few guys that outright hated "300" so I wasn't exactly looking forward to "Watchmen" and I'll admit on first viewing I didn't like it. But unlike "300", somehow Watchmen got better on second viewing and while I still have issues with it, it at least shows Snyder improving as a director; it's just unfortunate he wasn't at his A game when he made this one.<br /><br />It's 1985 unlike the one we had where President Nixon is enjoying his 5th term as president and the world ticks ever-so-closer to nuclear war, shown visually by the Doomsday Clock, which inches gradually to midnight. Helping out the city were the Watchmen, a group of costumed superheroes who were then outlawed or put under government control by the government after protesting of vigilantism. But when the Comedian, a.k.a Edward Blake, is murdered, attention now comes back to the Watchmen as they try to figure out who murdered the Comedian as well as if they have the capability to halt the impending nuclear war.<br /><br />A lot of director's cuts are usually extended to either provide an alternate version of the film, a kind of optional "if you want to" version where it doesn't really add or subtract from the film but gives you an alternate take on the movie like Terminator 2 or Alien whereas most of the time this is the director's preferred cut; the one they wanted to make that got sidelined thanks to intervening executives. With the "Watchmen" and its director's cut, one can actually see that a better movie was hiding underneath than what we got theatrically as scenes are aloud to breathe a lot more, things are fleshed out and the overall pacing, while still a long movie (hair above 3 hours), is at least a little more likable. However, that still leaves things a little awkward in terms of the whole where pieces of the movie work really well like the jailbreak scene and the assassination attempt on Ozymandias and yet things in the middle just kind of feel "there" and never really connect or add to the movie's flow.<br /><br />As far as the casting is concerned, it's a bit inconsistent. Arguably, the best thing Snyder did on the movie was casting Jackie Earle Haley as the seriously messed up Rorschach and now it's hard to picture that character or read the graphic novel without his voice and performance being remembered. In many ways he's the best thing about the movie and I'd even go as far as saying it's similar to the great performance Heath Ledger did as the Joker. (Might even have my new Halloween costume, HA!) As for everyone else, well Jeffrey Dean Morgan makes a good lasting impression with what little screen time he has and Carla Cugino has the first Silk Spectre is good as well and yet I found Billy Crudup's voice as Dr. Manhattan to be, well, more like bored or lazy than detached and unemotional and the should-be awkward and poor shaped Nite Owl is instead played by handsome looking Patrick Wilson so unlike say the X-Men movies where there was barely a miscasting, here it's like one works but somebody else doesn't fit the bill.<br /><br />One thing that Watchmen does do is look rather stunning in Blu-Ray and many times I was like "wow, now that's impressive" and many scenes such as the crashing of glass at the end of the movie, a late-movie explosion and even the detail on Rorschach's mask where you can see the strands and thread is quite outstanding. However when you look at the way the film was shot well, this is Snyder we're talking about and the words "slow motion" will frequently come to mind. It's clearly a style-over-substance tactic he's using and he does severely overkill it at times but the clarity on the Blu-ray transfer at least makes it look cool. Also note that this is a particularly violent film and there's quite a few parts that'll make you go "ooooh...." in wincing.<br /><br />For those of you who are wondering, there is a bigger edition coming out in December which will include most likely an even longer cut and other things in the package which is not surprising considering "300" just came out with its, what, Blu-ray release? But as a movie I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this; now I have to go watch "Zodiac" again and make sure my tastes haven't been diluted with time.</p></body></html>

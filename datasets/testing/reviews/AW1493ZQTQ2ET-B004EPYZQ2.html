Unfortunately, some of these elements felt like caricatures, and their blending often felt contrived.  In other words, the movie felt too formulaic, rather than developing from a fully matured vision.<br /><br />I asked my daughter what she thought of it, and she said it was good, but she didn't love it.  I guess I felt about the same.  I suppose you could do worse than to watch it, but I can't strongly endorse it.  Certainly not destined to become a classic.</p></body></html>

In this latest edition, we find the planet still overrun by flesh-eating zombies, but now the hitherto mindless creatures seem to be developing the ability to think for themselves.  In true "Masque of the Red Death" fashion, the elite survivors have holed up in a protected fortress trying to carry on the rituals of everyday life as if nothing whatsoever were wrong with the world outside.  The city is run by a ruthless tyrant, hammily played by Dennis Hopper, while Simon Baker and John Leguizamo portray mercenaries who go out on zombie-zapping missions to protect the citizenry, but who aren`t "good enough" to secure a home alongside the well-to-do in the walled-off city.<br /><br />Although there are a few novel twists floating around in "Land of the Dead," the sad fact is that, with this film, Romero may have gone once too often to the zombie well (actually make that twice too often, since the third film "Day of the Dead" was no great shakes either).  Gone is the nightmarish starkness that informed both "Night of the Living Dead" and "Dawn of the Dead," having been replaced by scenes that look as if they came straight out of a poor man's version of "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."  These zombies have simply lost the power to either disturb or scare us, and so the movie becomes just another flat action flick with a lot of random shooting at nameless targets.  The terror of the original film came from seeing ordinary, average people trying to cope with a situation for which there was no precedent, and having to fight against a threat they could not even begin to understand.  Yet, in a world in which zombies have become an everyday event, and everyone we`re involved with seems to be a trained zombie killer, the ability of the creatures to unnerve us becomes severely diminished.<br /><br />I guess we're not supposed to actually link this film all the way back to the 1968 original, since the characters in here - who are clearly in their twenties and early thirties - keep referencing back to a more halcyon time before the zombie invasion.  Moreover, the presence of modern technology, in the form of cell phones and home computers, implies a much later date for the initial event as well (I mean, if the world had really been overrun by the living dead for close to forty years, would cell phones ever have been invented?).<br /><br />As he did (quite successfully) in "Dawn of the Dead," Romero tries to make some satirical points along the way - in this case, about the cravenness of human nature and the inequity of the caste system - but the attempts here are so feeble that they just come across as stereotypical and hackneyed (particularly Hopper's callous, unfeeling, every-man-for-himself dictator).<br /><br />With so many other directors beating Romero at his own game of late - with better zombie pictures like "28 Days" and the remake of "Dawn of the Dead" - the filmmaker may have inadvertently laid the groundwork for his own destruction.  One wonders if, like the zombies who have made him famous, Romero will ever be able to rise again.</p></body></html>

The soothing and comforting persona of Michelle Rodriguez is twined and contrasted with the rugged and disfigured character of Danny Trejo. Rodriguez retained her consisted role of anti establishment and conscientious bend she performed in Avatar in saving the Pandora population. Trejo depicted the endless suffering of illegal aliens and fitted perfectly in the role of a fearless underdog who could transform society with his serious and deep wounds.<br /><br />Watching the two movies; Machete and The Lottery Ticket, in one week gave a sense of the disparities of the Black and Hispanic struggles for civil rights. The Lottery Ticket displayed the law abiding citizens of the black projects living under the poverty line and succumbing to the dominance of felons.  Machete played the harsh realities of a society of law that would only uphold its laws when the public remains vigilant. The Hispanics must climb the hills frequented by the Blacks in order to gain justice and ward off the foul play of crooks with official power. They did so with the modern access to high tech firearms.<br /><br />Machete kills and kills again and always comes back. But Machete's gathered hard evidence could easily be suppressed with the greater evil of corruption in a government that lacks conscience and motivated by greed and self enrichment. However, the network appeared a logical evolution of the suffering of the illegal aliens. Michelle Rodriguez was fortunate enough to find the Pandora clans on another planet, in parallel with her Hispanic Planet. Her people are described as cockroaches, illegal, and undocumented and marginalized from society, but she was blessed with gift of healthy soul and untainted conscience. From flying an exotic airship on Pandora, to running a taco truck in Machete, Rodriguez added a spine to a movie that already has many bright stars.<br /><br />The movie succeeded brilliantly in touching the hearts and souls of the underdogs and oppressed, when the mass media wages incessant onslaught on illegal aliens without the slightest chance to represent the other side of the story.  Machete did.</p></body></html>

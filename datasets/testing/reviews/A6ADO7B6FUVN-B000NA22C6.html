This is however, one of the better adaptations of a King novel.  Nonetheless, it is not unique in its presentation as it carries much similarity with films such as Brian de Palma's Raising Cain (1992) and the more recent Identity (2003).<br /><br />The second opening of the film has suggestive undercurrents to the theme of the film, as it cues the audience into the story.  The audience follows the camera lens in over a lake as it depicts a small rural house toward which the audience smoothly moves.  The audience moves in closer toward the house and in through a window as it finally faces a mirror through which the audience can see the main character sleeping on a coach.  The person sleeping is Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp), a successful writer who has escaped his wife and divorce after having discovered her cheating on him six months ago in a local motel.<br /><br />When Mort wakes up from one of his afternoon naps a southern man by the name of John Shooter (John Turturro), demands justice as he insinuates that Mort has stolen his story.  Shooter gives Mort three days to rectify what he has done wrong, as he demands justice.  On the second day, Shooter kills Mort's dog.  Mort contacts the police, but the local police do not seem interested in his case, and in turn, he seeks help from a private agency that he has used in the past.  Nevertheless, the help Mort hired seems to be incapable to providing the help that he requested, as Shooter threatens him once more, this time inside his house, while the deadline draws nearer.<br /><br />David Koepp who wrote the screenplay for Spider-Man (2002) directs Secret Window, which brings a similar suspense that can be experienced in his other film Stir of Echoes (1999).  Johnny Depp as well as John Turturro enhance the cinematic experience through their great performances, as a well performing cast supports their parts.  As the end credit roll before the eyes of the audience they will have experienced a well-made film with the lesson of not trusting what one sees.</p></body></html>

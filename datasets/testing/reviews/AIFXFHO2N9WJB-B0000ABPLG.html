Proving that good sci-fi can be comprised of terrific storytelling, and contain issues and ideals that do apply to the modern day, the sci-fi world was allowed to explore other things than just the inside of a space ship.  In 2002, writer/director Kurt Wimmer presented audiences with a bleak look at a post-World War 3 existence for humanity in "Equilibrium".<br /><br />"Equilibrium" is set in Earth's future where World War 3 has occurred, in an attempt to stop any and all future wars from happening, the powers that be have outlawed the very thing that makes us human, emotion!  Requiring that all people of the world take a daily dose of a emotion-blocking drug, and that anything that could possibly trigger emotional responses are destroyed.  To enforce these laws, the governement forms an elite police force known as, Grammaton Clerics.  Trained in the art of 'Gun-Kata', a blend of martial arts and weapons training, the Clerics are a force to be reckoned with.  When a resistance to the anti-emotion laws begins to increase in strength, the government looks to it's top Grammaton Cleric, John Preston (Christian Bale) to bring an end to the rebellion.  During a raid on a rebellion hideout, Preston meets a woman who slowly unlocks the emotions within him.  As a result Preston slowly begins to cease his emotion-blocking drug, and starts to feel all of the emotions he had never experienced.  Realizing that what the government and the Grammaton Clerics are doing is wrong, Preston joins forces with the resistance to bring down the emotion-less leaders of this dark world, bringing emotion back to Earth's people.<br /><br />Packed full of incredible action scenes that can easily rival "The Matrix", a strong story of redemption and self-discovery, writer/director Kurt Wimmer has masterfully crafted a new classic for the sci-fi genre.  Terrific performances from all involved, it has to be tough for an actor to give a solid performance without relying on their emotions, delivering their lines virtually dead-pan and not sounding bored is an achievement for any actor.  This cast comprised of Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, and Sean Bean deliver on all counts, Christian Bale especially, his journey of self-discovery regarding his emotions is carefully handled, and Bale truly excels with conveying every newly discovered feeling Preston has in this film.<br /><br />Sadly, this movie did not do well in the box-office, mostly due to other sci-fi films of recent time overshadowing it's possibility, films such as, "The Matrix", "Minority Report", and "Star Wars - Episode 2:  Attack of the Clones".  Though it didn't do well, it has enjoyed a fairly strong following on DVD that serves as a testament to the film's quality, that even though it didn't produce strong box-office numbers, doesn't mean it's not a good movie that audiences will enjoy and pay money to see on DVD.  If you are a sci-fi fan, especially of the other movies I listed above, or even just an action movie/martial arts fan, then I truly believe that you will enjoy "Equilibrium".  So do yourself a favor and rent it today, you won't be sorry.<br /><br />"Equilibrium" is rated R for violence.</p></body></html>

You get wrapped up in his portrayal without it being a distraction.  Isn't that what's most important when taking on a role like this?  I think the movie remained fair and accurate without being overly liberal, considering most of the talent involved I'm assuming, were not Bush Fans!  The old quote "just reportin' the facts, folks" comes to mind.  I think this film put a face on how George Bush operated and functioned as a man and as our Commander In Chief.  I'm sure republicans will only deny most of the films accuracy, but I think we all know this was just a tiny slice of what really went on in that man's world.  Actually he was probably WORSE than what this film portrayed, I think they were being NICE and in the end, generous to George Bush as not too humiliate and slander him any more than what he's already done to himself.  The end scene plays out in a prolific statement that the sport he so loved baseball, was how Bush saw himself in the field of politics.  And when it really counted, that last chance at catching a home-run ball, the moment eludes him, the ball flies over his head and all he can do is sit there and look dumbfounded.  Such as his 8 years in office.  This film confirms my belief that George Bush really was a terrible man and comes from a spoiled arrogant family that seems to think they are entitled to the world on a platter.  Humble he was not which is a contradiction to his religious lifestyle.  This film is a testament to the worst presidency our country has ever had the misfortune to endure.  A special shout-out to the actor who played Colin Powell.  There was one scene that added some much needed comic relief when he told Cheney to f@#$ off.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dahlia fails to deliver"></head><body><p>Rich in initial promise, De Palma's plush period drama is ultimately notable only for its utterly unfocused execution and the mostly squandered potential of an A-list cast.<br /><br />Set against the backdrop of LA in the 1940's, the film revolves alternately around the odd love triangle between its three lead stars, the murder of a young aspiring actress (the titular "Dahlia") and socio-political commentary on the corrupt origins of the home of America's film industry. If this wasn't ambitious enough, a vague whisper of the ongoing war in Europe, a subplot about boxing, another about a robbery/blackmail/vendetta, and a host of ancillary characters and events are thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The film stutters awkwardly from one event to the next and often fails, throughout its 2 hour course, to address or explain the significance of what is occurring. Even the final "unmasking" of the mystery is not convincing enough to illuminate the meaning of the previous 120 minutes. This leaves the viewer with the distinct impression of having watched a very finely polished turd, but a turd none the less.<br /><br />One gets the impression that De Palma is trying to outdo a film of similar ambition and setting: LA Confidential. Unfortunately De Palma is unable to recreate the balance of character study, ambiance, and cohesive plot that made Confidential a success, not to mention, a movie actually worth watching.</p></body></html>

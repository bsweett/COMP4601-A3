Although small in scope, it nonetheless enchants because of its ample supply of charm.<br /><br />Andrew Largeman (Braff) returns to his hometown after the death of his mother.  Andrew's father, Gideon (Ian Holm) wants to re-establish his relationship with his son but Andrew chooses to keep company with his circle of old friends instead.  One day he meets a girl named Sam (Natalie Portman) who starts to introduce him to all the possibilities life can offer him.  As their relationship develops, Andrew finds the courage to come to grips with his tragic past.<br /><br />The success of "Garden State" is due primarily to the three performances at the center of the story.  Zach Braff gives just the right touch of poignancy to Andrew and Peter Sarsgaard brings a likeable, roguish charm to Mark, one of Andrew's old friends.  It is Portman, however, that shines the brightest.  Her offbeat and touching performance gives the film its eccentric identity.  While the melodrama in "Garden State" gets a little too heavy at spots, its universal story about moving on with one's life still is told well enough to make the film worthy of a viewing.</p></body></html>

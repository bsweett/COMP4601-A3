That is, he had nothing of great import to say about his chosen subject and expected us belatedly to do the work. The result is of questionable merit. After 9/11, the need to compile and endlessly replay Twin Towers footage from every conceivable angle struck me as almost getting off on the spectacle. Likewise here, "Roll up! Roll up! Dare yourself to climb aboard the United 93 Rollercoaster ride of a lifetime! You'll "ooh", you'll "aagh" and leave covered in sweat and tears with your stomach in your throat!" The 'movie movie' type thriller music, especially when the second plane impacts is a dead giveaway in this regard. Since the purpose of 9/11 was to create terror in the civilian population, it seems wilfully perverse to allow oneself to be terrorized a second time, doing their work for them. It is giving them the 'oxygen of publicity' as Maggie Thatcher once put it. I'm not saying it was made purely for reasons of venality. Few films make money and this was definately a hard sell. Nevertheless, I suspect many will be going for the visceral experience alone, rather than for anything edifying (which is, in any case, not there) and must be counted as something of an own goal by the West.<br /><br />I was also minded of 'Hookey' in 'Zulu', whose descendants were offended by the wholly unjustified portrayal of him as a malingerer at Rorke's Drift. A passenger had his life cruelly cut short by terrorists on board United 93.  Was it neccessary to besmerch his memory as a collaborator, and on what evidence? That was really disgraceful.</p></body></html>

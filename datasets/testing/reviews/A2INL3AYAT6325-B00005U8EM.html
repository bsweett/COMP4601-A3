<meta name="summary" content="Funny, original film"></head><body><p>I remember when this came out.  Bill was on "GMA" & did the weather.<br /><br />Funny, original film.  You wish comedies were ALL like this.<br /><br />Bill did a great job as Phil.  All the things he did in the film as February 2 kept repeating.<br /><br />Harold in his bit part as the doctor.  Another cameo by Willie Garson  (Stanford from Sex & the City, There's Something About Mary).<br /><br />Decent extras on the DVD.<br /><br />BUT, an anniversary edition?  Needed more.  Like.........<br /> NO CHAPTER LIST OR ANY INFORMATION INSIDE ON THE FILM.  The film was a hit & this is an anniversary release of it, how about something inside to read on the film?<br /><br />I did NOT care for the artwork on the front.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Much better than Lost in Translation"></head><body><p>I've alaways been a big Bill Murray fan, Ghostbusters, Rushmore, Groundhog Day, Kingpin, Caddyshack, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Ed Wood and now Broken Flowers rate as some of his best performances to date. After the disappointing Lost in Translation which was praised as if it had been blessed by the buddha himself by every single critic under the sun, I wasn't sure if this was going to be another overrated, over hyped boring snoozer too. This one turned out to be a fresh highly original and beautifully acted film, equal parts humor and dramatic narrative, a movie with a heart and a brain. Bill Murray is in peak form here. Bill Murray has the ability that many actors whose primary income was based on comedic talents to switch effectivly between serious and tongue in cheeck hilarious with a blink of the eye. Highly recommended film. Funny,touching and tragic at times, a quality film that I wish we saw more of.</p></body></html>

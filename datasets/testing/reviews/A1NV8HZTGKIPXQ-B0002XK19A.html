For a long time sequels are looked down upon, and are almost never as good as the original. But a superior sequel, while rare, does happen. Just look at "Aliens" and "Terminator 2", among few others. And so Sam Raimi and his cast and crew have done one of those rare hollywood achievements. A big Hollywood sequel that's so much better than the original. Not saying anything about part 1, of course. Here, with a bigger budget, more dazzling effects, a better, more interesting villain, and a more richly textured script and story with more heart and meaning, the films eclipses the first one on all levels. I am surprised with how well I took in the franchise because I was never a Spider-Man fan when I was little. Knew absolutely nothing about it. What a surprise. Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker, still a young kid now in college, who is trying desperatley to keep his life together, although with school, a job, and being a web slinging superhero, it's not going very well. Enter Dr. Otto Octavius(Alfred Molina), a brilliant scientist whose recent research is funded by Peter's good friend, Harry Osborne(James Franco), who is out for revenge against Spiderman who he thinks killed his father. Things go bad when Dr. Octavius' new experiment foes horribly awry(don't they always?), and soon his tentacle arms he created are now a part of his body. Instead of getting help, the tentacles become more ominous and soon Doc Ock(as he is now referred too)begins to go mad to continue his research. What will he get?. Harry offers Doc Ock whatever he needs, if he brings Spiderman to him. Besides all that, there is the ongoing story of Peter's love for the lovely Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). And this is what's so great about the movie, and how it foes against the expected Hollywood conventions. The action and all of the superhero aspect of the movie is not what's important. It's not what's going on here. It's not how to make it bigger and bigger and throw in a storyline here to balance it out. In these movies, the movie is about the people. Not the heroics or the effects or whatever. Raimi and his writers create characters that, under some odd circumstances, are real. People we believe in. The movie doesn't come back two years later and throw these people into just another wild adventure. The characters grow as anyone in reality does, and they are where they should be in two years. They don't stay in once place. They grow and mature and the storylines develop and go further, instead of forgetting everything and just making another movie. It's about the story and characters, and in this day and age, that is so refrshing and welcomed. The actors here are as good as ever. Maguire continues to prove that he is an excellent Peter Parker, and makes a convincing super hero. Kirsten Dunst emits just a lovely radiance that really makes her seem like the sweet girl next door that anybody would fall in love with, even tho her character still kinda becomes the "damsel in distress" here. James Franco is good, but his obsession with revenge got old pretty fast. It was a nice story arc for him and the movie, but it got annoying. Whenever you saw him, he would just change direction and throw it in Peter's face. Or at the party when he, drunkenly, sloshes up to Peter and just starts accosting him. It just felt pushed more than anything else. Alfred Molina was so much more likeable as the villain, because he had the humanity left in him. At the end, he was the nice guy we met earlier on. Willem Dafoe, who cameos, was good, but Molina and the character of Doc Ock was just so much better. It was also nice that J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris got bigger roles as well. And yes, Raimi regular Bruce Campbell makes another welcomed cameo. As does Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben. Things happen in this movie that will forever change things in the next film. I won't say what they are, but it will bring a new dynamic to the ongoing storyline for Part 3. The extras on the DVD are also incredible and exhausting. Spider-Man 2 has been hailed as the best superheo movie ever, and while I have another one that takes that place, this one is definitley strong enough to take that title. This movie makes Spider-Man 3 that much more exciting. Thanks Sam.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Bio-Pics I've ever seen!"></head><body><p>Jamie Foxx more than earned his recent Best Actor Oscar win with this brilliant portrayal of the one and only musical genius of Ray Charles.  Perhaps more than Denzel Washington as Malcolm X, Lawrence Fishburne as Ike Turner, Angela Bassett as Tina Turner, or Will Smith as Mohammed Ali...Foxx's performance made me forget that it was anyone other than Ray Charles himself on the silver screen.  To call it merely an "impersonation" is to belittle a skill that many actors can't pull off.  Watch "Saturday Night Live" for impersonations of famous people, but can any of those actors carry an entire film, causing the viewer to forget that its merely an impersonation and getting absorbed as though we are watching Ray Charles' life play out before our very eyes.<br /><br />I read some critiques of this film suffering from the usual bio-pic pitfalls of what angle to present a famous person's life story and where to begin and end such a film.  This film does everything right in terms of how a bio-pic should be made and the creative license that convey a person's inner demons was well done in this film.  The flashback sequences were well done and weren't confusing, and they helped the viewer understand the underlying motives of a childhood tragedy and how it helped create the person Ray Charles came to be.<br /><br />What I loved most was seeing just why Ray Charles was considered a genius, as he knew when to move on to bigger and greener pastures with an impeccable sense of timing and what he is owed.  He could easily have wasted years if not decades at the hands of some craven club owners in Seattle who knew they had a rare and profitable talent on their hands and weren't thinking in his best interest, but their own greed.  People might have thought they could pull things over a blind man's head, but he always got the last laugh.<br /><br />That's not to say that he was a perfect man.  The scenes of implied heroin use were heartbreaking, but redemption comes in the end when an arrest and drug treatment forces him to face his demons once and for all to kick his habit.  The scenes of his going cold turkey should be a warning lesson to anyone considering using drugs without regard to aftereffects.  That Ray Charles kicked his habit cold turkey and never relapsed is another testament to his genius.<br /><br />What got the most laughs and applause in theaters where I saw it, was when Ray Charles refused to perform in a segregated venue in Georgia, causing the state to ban him for life.  The irony of it all as we watch the film in 2004/2005 is that we know that his "Georgia On My Mind" is the official state song of our state and he was given the hero's welcome in the state capitol in 1979.<br /><br />This film is an impressive tribute to one of the greatest musical geniuses of our time and worth seeing and owning in your personal dvd collection.  If you buy this dvd, you'll probably want the cd soundtracks as well...as the first thing I did after seeing this movie was running out to buy a greatest hits cd since I regrettably didn't have a single Ray Charles cd in my collection.  That'll change after seeing the movie.  Ray Charles' music is diverse enough for everyone to like at least some of his songs.</p></body></html>

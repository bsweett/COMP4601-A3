<meta name="summary" content="Very enjoyable!"></head><body><p>This movie doesn't stand out on its own like Wall-E does, but it is definitely a good movie and worth watching again. The story's funny, the CGI is gorgeous, the relationship between rat and cook is endearing, and the villain and his motives believable. Overall, I can't really complain about this movie, so two thumbs up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's easy to look down on other animated movies when you're flying on a dragon"></head><body><p>DreamWorks has hit an absolute homerun with How to Train Your Dragon.  Holding its own against anything from Pixar, the animation is nearly unparalleled.  The story of Hiccup (Baruchel), a gangly Viking teen with pipe-cleaner arms, is one of courage, understanding, and acceptance.  When all other Vikings are learning to engage in war or actually battling the evil dragons alongside Hiccup's conspicuously-named father Stoick (Butler), young Hiccup must ignore his fears and unfortunate name to show the others a more delicate and ultimately superior approach toward winning over the dragons.<br /><br />The primary draw of HTTYD is of course the animation.  One scene in particular shows multiple characters flying over an ocean that literally made me want to dive in.  The waves, the colors, the breakers, the motion, it was all perfect.  The water itself could have been replaced in any non-animated movie and not a sole would have noticed.  The rest of the animation came in a close second, with amazing detail in every blade of grass, every eyebrow raise, every gust of wind.  Stunning.<br /><br />Not simply a movie for the kids, this is perfect for all ages.  It's truly wonderful, with all facets of comparably good films represented.  The score is magnificent, allowing a viewer to be absorbed into the action.  The characters are well developed, diverse, interesting, and heartwarming; they blend perfectly.  The story itself is a classic tale of underdog winning by unorthodox methods to save the day, become famous, and get the girl.  Nearly everything works together seamlessly.<br /><br />In my opinion, there are only minor negatives of the film.  First and foremost, Jay Baruchel's nasally, whining voice fits the character, but comes across as fingernails on a chalkboard.  The other flaw as I see it, and it is admittedly minor, is the grayed moral relativism.  The primary antagonist was doing nothing wrong, merely surviving, and I couldn't help but compare her/it to Bambi's mother as an innocent character who met its demise.  Is it only sad when an ugly character or creature suffers?<br /><br />Nonetheless, I can't praise this movie enough.  I give it my highest possible recommendation.  There is a story and lesson for every age.  DreamWorks has really produced an outstanding movie that deserves repeat viewings.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

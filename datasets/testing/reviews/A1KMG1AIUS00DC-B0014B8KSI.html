<meta name="summary" content="Corporate Fixer Discovers Unpleasant Truths"></head><body><p>George Clooney is a genuine movie star.  He commands the screen, he attracts audiences, he chooses his film projects carefully, and he is incredibly good-looking.  When you toss in the fact that he's a fine actor, the combination of talent, looks, and charisma become a powerful force.<br /> Nowhere is this more in evidence than in his new film, "Michael Clayton," a movie that is so well conceived and so well acted that it practically jumps off the screen.  Few movies achieve this level of craftsmanship.  The script is truly a finished product rather than a draft that should have gone back for rewrites.<br /> Michael Clayton (Clooney) is a lawyer at Kenner-Bach, one of New York's largest and most prestigious law firms.  But he doesn't litigate or engage in other traditional lawyer activities.  He is too valuable as a "fixer," a role Clayton has been assigned by the  firm's co-founder, Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack).  Clayton is the go-to guy when embarrassing incidents involving staff members have to be covered up, bribes and payoffs must be made, or anything involving corporate profits pops up.  The divorced, burned-out Clayton is unhappy with his job, has a failed side business, and has built up a huge gambling debt.  Financially crippled, he can't walk away from a job he's come to hate.<br /> At the U/North corporation, the career of litigator Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) relies on the multi-million dollar settlement of a class action suit being handled by Clayton's firm.  All appears to be moving to a successful conclusion until Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), Kenner-Bach's star attorney, sabotages the case.  Clayton is called in to bring the erratic Edens under control before the entire case is irrevocably undermined.<br /> Wilkinson has a field day as Edens.  Whether he's having a tantrum in a board room, striding down the street with a dozen loaves of Italian bread under his arm, or explaining to Clayton in legalese why it would be nearly impossible to have him committed to a mental institution, he simultaneously conveys exasperation, guilt, cunning, and authority.  Wilkinson's precisely modulated performance is one of the movie's joys.<br /> Writer/director Tony Gilroy has done a masterful job at centering Clooney in an intriguing tale of morally crippled corporate cutthroat politics while anchoring us to the personal story of Clayton as he first coolly observes the mess created by an apparent nervous breakdown of his firm's top lawyer, but ultimately sees the man's actions as entirely clearheaded and sound.  We get to see Clayton change from a disgruntled, though highly efficient, guy who does the dirty work to a man with a conscience.  Never preachy, always riveting, the script explores all facets of Clayton's life, explaining how his weakness for gambling and his desire to create financial security for himself have left him at a depressing low.  Clooney keeps us in his corner, even though his Clayton is no traditional hero.<br /> Swinton is excellent as attorney Crowder, whose future rests on her success on the case.  Director Gilroy shows us her at home, facing the mirror, rehearsing not only the precise wording of her presentations, but their cadence as well.  She won't leave any detail to chance.  Swinton, seen previously as the White Witch in "The Chronicles of Narnia," is letter-perfect as an icy professional who will employ all resources to win.  We never see her in private life, except for those moments in front of the mirror.  Her life is work, and excelling is her agenda.  Little else matters.<br /> Sydney Pollack is also perfect as Marty Bach.  A friend to Clayton, he also knows how to tighten the screws, and he does this not with histrionics, but with soft-spoken, carefully chosen words.  This is a man who doesn't have to shout.  He's used to wielding power, and understands people often better than they do themselves.  Marty never panics when things get sticky for the firm.  He knows how to make bad things disappear, and Michael Clayton is the means.  Pollack has a completely natural delivery, which comes with his years as feature film director working with such stars as Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, Al Pacino, and Tom Cruise, among others.  He is immediately believable, particularly as a powerful man.  The role of Marty Bach fits him well.<br /> The film is a bit slow early on, where John Gilroy's editing could be tighter.  Overall, however, "Michael Clayton" is engaging and quite a ride.  It allows the viewer to eavesdrop on the inner workings of a big-money company, showing that a company with warts has on staff a guy who can surgically remove them before they fester.<br /> Rated R, "Michael Clayton" is top-form movie making.  Clooney is at his best -- perhaps his best screen work ever -- and the excellent supporting cast and clever, literate, script add up to two hours of solid entertainment.</p></body></html>

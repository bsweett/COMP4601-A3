<meta name="summary" content="If you like the game, you'll like the movie"></head><body><p>Resident Evil is a movie version of what is called "Survival Horror" in the gaming industry.  The ideas and a number of scenes are directly inspired by the Resident Evil Games.<p>Milla wakes up, naked in a shower and has no memory of the past.  She is in a large mansion.  Soon she is beset by commandos who claim she is one of them and that they work for the Umbrella Corporation.  In the mansion is an underground train station that leads to a large underground research facility that is in trouble.<p>In the facility, known as The Hive, the team is trying to shut down an AI computer that killed everyone in the facility.  Aside from the killer AI, there are plenty of zombies and even a monster.  The team must defeat these and get out before the facility becomes completely sealed.<p>Milla's character is central to the movie and she slowly regains her memories as the plot advances.  We come to know her better and feel sympathetic for her.<p>All of this is bound up and painted with classic elements of horror and action and blended so well you don't really notice the switches.  Camera angles, stunts and atmosphere really push the viewer's buttons and keep the fear and adrenaline running.<p>As the film nears its conclusion, the viewer tries to guess just what is going to happen and how it will be resolved, but the surprises keep coming until the final scene.<p>Very fun with a minimum of blood and gore for this type of movie, but with plenty of action and spookiness.</p></body></html>

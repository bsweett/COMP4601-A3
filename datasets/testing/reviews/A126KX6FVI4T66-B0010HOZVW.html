<meta name="summary" content="kill or be killed in New York?"></head><body><p>As much as I may have enjoyed this movie,<br />I think it is questionable making heroes out<br />of people twisted by life into monsters they themselves no longer recognize.<br />New York has turned itself into an hell on earth<br />with greed, crime and drugs, such that those receiving crime<br />are hard to distinguish from those dishing it out?<br />The woman vigilante here is New York's finest?<br />Something is very wrong when the police have lost so much<br />respect that people take the matters into their own hands.</p></body></html>

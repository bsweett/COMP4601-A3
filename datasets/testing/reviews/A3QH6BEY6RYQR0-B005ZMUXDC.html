<meta name="summary" content="Disney at its best"></head><body><p>An updated take on the story of Rapunzel. A young queen has been snatched from her crib and held for years by a woman posing as her mother. The young woman is not permitted to venture outside due to the "dangers" that lurk. A young thief who is running from the local authorities finds her, and their journey begins. An enchanting love story that looks great in 3D, this film will be enthralling for all who see it. Alan Menken's music is first-rate, There is humor for all ages, and the development of the relationship between the heroine and the hero will captivate adults. There is a paucity of cute and funny characters, which makes the film appeal to a slightly older audience than the typical Disney fare. This is a welcome addition to the line-up of Disney animated films.</p></body></html>

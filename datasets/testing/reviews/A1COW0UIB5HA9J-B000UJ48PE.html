<meta name="summary" content="An improvement over the original!"></head><body><p>Three American girls (Bijou Phillips, Lauree German and Heather Matarazzo) are on a European vacation in studying art. They aboard a train from Italy to Slovokia where they stay for a while at a local hostel that has a unique hot springs spa where it seems like a harmless vacation, it later turns into a nightmare of unrelentless horror when they are kidnapped by criminals that torture and murder people for profit but can they escape the horror of it all?<br /><br />While the original movie was a good if flawed effort into torture horror, i believe this is a very slight improvement over the original movie. Writer-Director Eli Roth and producer Quention Tarantino really delivers a sequel with more thrills and chills plus more gore such as the cringe-inducing castration sequence that is quite realistic, a young boy being shot, saw-blade to the skull etc. and decent acting. There is some darkly humorous moments especially the ending which i can't reveal but has to be seen to believe, legendary Italian horror director Ruggero Deoato (director of "Cannibal Holocaust" and "Jungle Holocaust") makes an amusing cameo appearence as a cannibal doctor.<br /><br />This DVD contains the uncut unrated version with footage not shown in the theatrical cut and has some goodies like three audio commentaries, radio interview with Eli Roth, deleted scenes, Gag Reel, International Televison Special on the film's making, and four featurettes.</p></body></html>

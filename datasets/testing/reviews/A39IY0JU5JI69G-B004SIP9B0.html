<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating film but how accurate is it?"></head><body><p>As one who has seen pictures of Elizabeth in early black and white newsreels in the local movie houses during WWII, I've been aware of her existence it seems like forever.  Sort of like water to a goldfish, she's always been "there" but I never thought much about her.  Until Diana's death and then my focus was on Diana.  Now this film has switched my focus to the Queen.  Hmmm.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Mirren's performance was superb and certainly Oscar worthy.  She's a classy lady and the class shows up here.  The one thing that worries me, though, is that she may have infused the character of Elizabeth with some of her own generous humanity, thus making her more friendly than she really is. I found myself much more sympathetic to her at the end of the film than I was in the beginning.  Even the doltish Prince Phillip seemed sort of harmlessly quaint and even humorous. Were these people really that nice?  Who knows?<br /><br />I have found this to be a problem in many films---I loved John Lone as the Last Emperor of China but was the real emperor really that sweet?  Doubt it. Also, Sir Thomas More....After watching Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons, anyone would immediately vote for More's sainthood.  Yet, we read that the real Thomas had a dark side that the film doesn't show.<br /><br />Like Marlon Brando's performance of the Godfather did a lot to glamorize  guys who probably were really an ugly bunch of thugs.<br /><br />So....I think it's important to see these "historical" movies, enjoy them, but keep an open mind about the veracity of the characterizations.  Film actors are by nature, attractive people, and it's a mistake to attribute their innate likableness to the people they portray.</p></body></html>

Of course, like all great stories, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan isn't so much trotting across the globe as descending into his own subconscious, a place populated with the angels and demons that lurk within each of us. Is he in Uganda to help the poor, to sleep around, to play out some paternalistic fantasy, or for something else? Does -- or could -- Garrigan even know? The Last King of Scotland understands that this is the essential, and essentially unanswerable, question of who and what we are.<br /><br />While McAvoy, as Garrigan, is wonderful as the smart, but self-deceiving doctor, his real accomplishment is holding his own in the face of as astonishing performance by Forest Whitaker as dictator Idi Amin. Whitaker brings to life a multi-dimensional, manipulative psychopath drunk with the thrill of adulation and power. Garrigan becomes more than Amin's personal physician, and, eventually, emerges so enmeshed in the psychopathology of Amin that, in defending the indefensible, he is defending himself and the monstrous adoptive father he will ultimately betray.<br /><br />Gillian Anderson, of X-Files fame, is emaciated and almost unrecognizable, with a brief, and fairly weak, turn as the wife of a clinic doctor and the target of Garrigan's blunt efforts at seduction. Kerry Washington, in contrast, shows startling power as the elegant and extraordinarily beautiful wife that bore two of Amin's sons and, ignored by him, falls into a torrid affair with Garrigan.<br /><br />The ending sequence of The Last King of Scotland is brutal and difficult to watch, but ultimately redemptive. Like another great film of 2006, Pan's Labyrinth, it is a very adult meditation on the nature of our humanity in all of its nobility and brutality.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Grace"></head><body><p>Maria is a young dissatisfied Columbian woman (actually 17) who works at a rose plantation to help support her family, including her unwed-mother sister. Life, including work, boyfriend and family, continue to grate on her and she gravitates to a recruiter of "mules"--young women who swallow latex-covered "pellets" of heroin to transport by commercial airline to New York City. Her veteran trainer describes the work as "not difficult, but not easy, either". I couldn't find the easy part. Swallowing in excess of 50 pellets didn't look too easy; nor did facing the suspicious US Customs agents; nor did risking the overdose that loomed if any the pellets broke.<br /><br />The result is a heartbreaking tale of longing for a better life and how criminal elements can exploit that longing. The "grace" of the title presages Maria's outcome, but much pain and sadness populates this movie as well. Catalina Sandino Moreno is riveting as the determined Maria and all the other cast members do a fine job well. The production and directorial-style and very straightforward so as to not distract from the compelling story.<br /><br />This movie is in Spanish with English subtitles. With the drug-related story and one violent scene, it is not really suitable for sub-teenage children, though it would help teenagers understand better the costs of the drug culture.</p></body></html>

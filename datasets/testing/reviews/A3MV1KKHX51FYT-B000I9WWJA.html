They have hostages and want two buses to transport everyone to an airplane at the airport. The police have plans to prevent this. But what if the gang knows what the police are planning and have a trick? [Believable?] Can they use the hostages to divert attention while they escape? [Only in a film.] Was anything stolen from the bank vault? Is one of the safety deposit boxes missing? Did it have any valuables or just documents?<br /><br />The conversations bring out the backgrounds of the characters. The film shows the trick used. [Is it possible to hide in a building for a week?] "No robbers, no loot missing, what happened?" Who would know what happened to that safety deposit box? Does it involve an event from the 1940s? Will Detective Frazier find a clue in his jacket? Will this crime be solved by the end of this film? If not, is this an inherent flaw in this story? [Yes.]<br /><br />The film has some good action scenes in the beginning but loses its way at the end because it lacks a better ending.</p></body></html>

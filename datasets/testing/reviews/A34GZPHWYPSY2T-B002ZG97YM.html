<meta name="summary" content="Vikings and Dragons ... Never Gets Old, Much Less Ancient"></head><body><p>HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON (2010) is a delightful and beautifully animated fantasy-themed story, the story of Viking teen Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) and his endeavors to fit in with his village. Also, they have the usual nasty dragon infestation and that turns out being the key to Hiccup's success.<br /><br />This is one of the most beautifully finished, well-shot animated features I've seen since THE INCREDIBLES and SURF'S UP. While it is slightly lacking in vocal talent (the best they could do was Jay Baruchel and America Ferrara as their lead voices??) it certainly isn't lacking in story, humor, charm or pure animation accomplishment. While I will not spoil anything further, I have to skewer the animators on one point: why is the most important dragon in this film made to look like Stitch from LILO AND STITCH?<br /><br />The details, though, make that well worth enduring; I loved all the different funny dragons and the Runic book which Hiccup is studying intently during his dragonslayer training. Saying which, though this film does borrow a bit too liberally from DRAGONHEART, young viewers won't notice - and won't care.<br /><br />All I can add is this film brought a sorely needed smile to my face, and is one of the best animated features I've seen in years. With the bizarre happenings at Pixar and Dream Works taking over the field, I was wondering when the next animated extravaganza would appear. Well, here it is, warts and all, and I love it. Kids from 3 to 103 are going to adore this great film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="above average assembly line thriller"></head><body><p>Despite the rather thorough drubbing it suffered at the hands of most of the nation's more prestigious critics, "Premonition" is actually a pretty well-thought-out and tightly wound thriller, given emotion and heart by its star, Sandra Bullock.  It's not a movie I would be willing to go to the mat for, but as throwaway thrillers go, this one is really not half bad.<br /><br />Bullock plays Linda Quinn Hanson, a suburban mother of two, who receives the shattering news that her husband has been killed in an auto accident.  However, when she wakes up the next morning, she finds him, strangely, sitting in the kitchen, suddenly alive and well, benignly sipping coffee before heading off to work.  The question quickly arises, did she dream the story of his death, is she dreaming now, or is she undergoing some sort of mental crisis precipitated by the shock of her loss?  Or is she caught in some sort of bizarre time warp that allows her to jump back and forth between the periods before and after his "death,"  and, if so, might she be able to step in and alter the course of events to prevent the accident from happening in the first place?<br /><br />In both concept and form, "Premonition" is pretty much an assembly-line thriller designed to tweak the audience's brain cells for a couple of hours before sending everyone home with not a whole heck of a lot left to think about once it's over.  Still, it's intriguing enough while it lasts and only the true nitpickers among us will feel compelled to put its twists and turns in logic under the scrutiny of a critical microscope.  Despite a few weak moments in her performance, Bullock actually makes us care about the character and the very strange thing that is happening to her.<br /><br />"The Premonition" is by no means a classic - or even first rate - chiller, but those with a few spare hours on their hands and a penchant for cinematic brain-puzzlers could do worse than check it out.</p></body></html>

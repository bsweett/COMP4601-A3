<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest Comic based movies ever!"></head><body><p>A collection 6 stories that interweaving the whole film set in the fictional city of Basin City aka Sin City as we start off with part 1 of "The Customer is Always Right" where a Salesman (Joss Harnett) invites a sexy customer (Marley Shelton) to his place to die. "That Yellow Bastard part 1" tells us how hard-boiled officer John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) swore to protect a young girl named Nancy (Makenzie Vega) from a child-killer/rapist named Roak Junior (Nick Stahl) but fails then next we have "The Hard Good-Bye" where a big-chinned powerhouse named Marv (Mickey Rouke) was having an affair with a sexy girl named Goldie (Jaime King) until he wakes up to find her dead. He has been set-up as he runs from the law as he interrogates some people including a priest (Frank Miller) for finds out a crazed swifted clawed maniac named Kevin (Elijah Wood) who has a taste to literally eat prostitutes and finds out the rotten cardinal (Rutger Hauer) is all behind this for justice must be served. Following after that "The Big Fat Kill" has Dwight (Clive Owen) taking care of an abusive man named Jackie-Boy (Benico Del Toro) but while he finds the sleaziest part of town run by protective prostitues lead by tough but sexy leader Gail (Rosario Dawson) who wage a war with some mercenaries like Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan). Then we have "That Yellow Bastard part 2" has Hartigan sentenced 9 years to prison then after that he is released to find the young girl Nancy (Jessica Alba) all grown up at 19, unfortunately a deformed yellow man named Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahls) kidnaps her as he must save the girl then finally we end with part 2 of "The Customer is Always Right" where i won't reveal to you the ending.<br /><br />A brilliant, cold-blooded and hard boiled adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreaking graphic novel series from Dark Horse Comics. Robert Rodriguez who is one of the best action directors joins up with Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino to make a dazzling cocktail of a movie with stunning visual effects. I like how it accurately depicts 4 graphic novels in one movie page-by-page scene-by-scene shot in glorious black-and-white with some color tints in some areas for select objects. The violence is gory and graphic but mainly white colored at times to make it look like out of the comics which is a very nifty and creative idea i should say. The performances are very good as is the direction by 3 directors and i love the surreal nature of the design for the film. Co-starring Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Jason Duoglas and Brittney Murphy i gotta say the casting was spot on especially Mickey Rouke as Marv was absolutely perfect. I saw this movie 4 times in theaters as i knew they would not screw up this adaptation and satisfies action fans including fans of comics/graphic novels.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set has absolutely flawless picture and sound quality like if it was like going to the theaters. Disc one has Cine-Explorer where you hear an audio commentary by the filmmakers plus shots from the graphic novels with green screen test footage along with the movie as you watch plus audience reaction track as well. Disc 2 has the unrated recut extended edition which is longer and violent with cool extras like "Kill em good" which is an interactive comic plus Rodgriguez extras like 16 minute film school, all green screen version, the long take, Sin City: Live in Concert and 10 minute cooking school. Additional extras are featurette on how they put the graphic novels on film, interview with Quentin Taranitno, 3 featurettes and trailers and teasers.<br /><br />A must have for cinema fans and even geeks of comic book/graphic novel films.</p></body></html>

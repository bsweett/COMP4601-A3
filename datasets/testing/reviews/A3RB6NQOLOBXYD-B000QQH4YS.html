<meta name="summary" content="Great movie....And Great DVD!"></head><body><p>Robocop is deff. one of the most underated sci-fi movies out there. Being under the shadow of terminator it never got the respect it derserved. The criterion dvd is also amazing, robocop fans like myslef finally get to see the directors cut. The extra violent shots taken are out are pretty interesting and the commentary is also very good. This verison is currently out of print, but if you can get your hands on it, its worth every penny. It is rumored that MGM studios is re-releasing a robocop special edition, but I can assure robocop fans that it will not have the unrated director's cut, or commentary. In other words stick with the criterion version, Thier line of dvd's are amazing, and well worth the extra money.</p></body></html>

This time they are short on time, since they only have 72 hours until a massive number of probes will reach the underground city of Zion.  Before this Neo must get into the Matrix where some strange occurrences have been observed by the crew on the Nebuchadnezzar, the hovercraft, which leads to some visually stunning scenes.  In the Matrix Neo seeks out the Oracle in order to find some answers to some questions that they have; however, the answers lead to further questions which turn into a maze of problems.  Matrix Reloaded uses some amazing special effects that cost a fortune to produce, however, the beginning of the film has some troubling transitions and scenes that causes awkwardness in the storyline.  These clumsy cinematic moments are temporarily saved by the special effects, but in the long run the film suffers from a cinematically congested introduction that is full of inelegant transitions between scenes and characters. In the end, the audience is presented with a story that offers some valuable lessons and quick paced entertainment, but it does not measure up with the forerunning story.</p></body></html>

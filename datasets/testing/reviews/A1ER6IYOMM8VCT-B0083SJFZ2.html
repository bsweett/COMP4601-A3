<meta name="summary" content="A GOOD REMAKE! BUT COMPARE THE TWO FILMS!"></head><body><p>When it comes to Ray Harryhausen there is no bigger fan of his work and films. When I heard about this remake I was excited, but after reading many reviews I decided to wait until it came on cable before seeing it. I happened to come across this Blu Ray very cheap and I took a chance. To my surprise, this remake isn't as bad as many have claimed, but does nothing to improve on the original either.<br /><br />The special effects are a highlight in both versions, but in this film they are used sparingly. You never get a good look at the monsters, only quick cuts and fast motion I assume to hide the cracks in the CGI work? I know the younger generation see Ray Harryhausen's(RH)work as old fashioned or even quaint, but he is one of the pioneers of the craft and has and will continue to inspire generations of film makers long after this remake disappears into obscurity. It was fitting of the makers of this fim to put in a cameo of BoBo the owl as a nod to RH.<br /><br />The story has been changed, but not for the better, only adding confusion and depriving us of a real hero. In RH's original film the story was more straightforward and even though a little corny at times, it did a better job of keeping the motives of the characters more believable.<br /><br />Back to the special effects as this is really the reason to watch any Harryhausen film remake or not. I'm glad that they kept RH's design for Medusa as is it one of the coolest interpretations of her, even though not accurate by Mythological standards. As far as RH's stop motion work, I really don't think people are aware of the amount of work that RH put into the Medusa sequence in the original. Medusa's snake filled hair, her tail and all body movements are painstakingly done with the upmost finesse and skill. Even more amazing is that the flame lit lair is also something he had to take into consideration. Switching the light reflection frame by frame to make it look like flames flickering. Add in the fact the man was in the twilight of his career at almost 70 years old! It was nothing short of breathing taking in its time and I doubt it could ever be duplicated. If we factor in the money and time allowed to create this and all the other creature effects, it is unbelievable that it was completed. I would have loved to see what he could have done with a budget of the remake!<br /><br />The Medusa in this film looks very good, but I think there is more tension in the original scene with her slowly stalking her intruders. In fact, most of the creatures in this remake serve only as a reminder of how great Harryhausen was at his craft, giving his creatures life and personality. The original film suffers from budget restraints that actually effect the look of the film, as all the prints I've seen of it are dark, grainy and the matte shots stick out like a sore thumb, so naturally this remake looks incredible by comparison.<br /><br />The original has more creatures and the story is told in a more entertaining way, but the remake has some impressive special effects and a story that is not as corny. If only we could combine the two to make one great film. Clash of the Titans is a solid action adventure film with some nifty effects, but I will watch RH's version far more times than this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Makes you feel just as good as Forest Gump did!"></head><body><p>Big Fish didn't do that great in the box office and also wasn't as well appreciated as it should've been. Critics seemed to take more of a liking to the foreighn film Barbarian Invasion. Since both came out around the same time and both are about an old man's last hours with his family. So most critics gave Big Fish lower ratings because they liked The Barbarian Invasion more. Some critics did notice it and appreciate it a lot but not enough did.  <p>  Meanwhile I think Big Fish deserved the sort of appreciation that Forest Gump got. Hell for me it made me feel the way I did when I first saw Forest Gump as well. It's touching, uplifting, funny, romantic and highly imaginative. The performances  are great as well. Ewan McGregor is fantastic as young Edward Bloom and Albert Finny is equally great as old Edward Bloom. Billy Crudup (Almost Famous), Jessica Lange (Tootsie), Danny Devito, Helen Bohen Carter (Fight Club) and Steve Buscemi (Ghost World) are all good in supporting roles as well. Critic Roger Ebert said that Tim Burton does better work when he focuses more on a story than effects like with Sleepy Hollow and Edward. He makes it sound like Big Fish doesn't focus more on the story when it does. It's all story and all heart. Burton isn't George Lucas, he can make a good movie even without eye popping effects. He proved that with EdWood and I think he proved that with Big Fish too. When it was over, I was thinking about the acting, direction and the story and about how good of a movie I just saw.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Steve Carrell makes this movie funny..."></head><body><p>I remember watching the old t.v. show version of "Get Smart" in reruns as a kid and laughing my head off.  I didn't do it with the movie, but it did get a few chuckles out of me. You can thank the comedy genius known as Steve Carrell for that.  He plays Maxwell Smart.  Like most t.v. shows turned to movies, the movie verion of "Get Smart" isn't that good, but I still laughed quite a bit, mostly during the bits Steve Carrell had.<br />Agent 99 was played by Anne Hathaway who merely impresses me. She isn't an actress I generally watch films of. She is ok, but she doesn't hold a candle anywhere near Barbara Feldon's 99.  Okay, I'll stop comparing the two now.<br />The film also stars Alan Arkin as the Chief(who is actually pretty good in this movie, he does comedy well), Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock as Agent 23, Terrence Stamp as the bad guy, Siegfried, and Bill Murray has one scene he is in as one of the other agents.<br />This is worth renting if you like Carrell's work, if you are a big fan of the show, rent or buy the episodes instead.</p></body></html>

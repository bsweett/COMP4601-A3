This set contains four DVDs, with the first three Indiana Jones films ("Raiders of the Lost Ark", "The Temple of Doom", and "The Last Crusade") being housed in their own cases. As a bonus (and the real jewel here) is the informative and entertaining fourth disc that contains a slew on bonus features on all three movies. Among the features are over three hours of bonus material that includes an amazing extra-length documentary called "Indiana Jones: Making The Trilogy", The Stunts of Indiana Jones, The Sound of Indiana Jones, trailers, and much more. Subtitles for all the films are English, French, and Spanish and this boxset either comes in full screen or widescreen formats. A wonderful addition to anyone's home DVD library at a fantastic price.</p></body></html>

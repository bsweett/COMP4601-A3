As far as performances go, George C. Scott exceeds all expectations in this role. You get the feeling while watching him that the actor indeed thought he was his character during his time on the set. His Patton is the epitome of passion, desire, will, and honor. Of course, true to life, he was a complicated figure and the film displays this aspect of the man as well. He was vainglorious and rash--attributes often expected, and forgivable in a general. Scott's impressive but so is the script. One of the nice things about this DVD is that Francis Ford Coppola gives a short intro in which he shares that he was the screenplay writer and also fleshes out a few circumstances around the making of The Godfather. His perspective adds to one's appreciation of the film. Patton also has some great action scenes such as the initial battle in the desert against, who he thought was, Rommel. The German General Staff scenes are speculative but unquestionably entertaining. I find Patton to be a fun and noble flick.</p></body></html>

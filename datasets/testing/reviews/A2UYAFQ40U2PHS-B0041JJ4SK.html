It has a few choice moments (especially Neil Patrick Harris's turn as himself), but overall it's rather dull, and the stoner genre was covered much better with Cheech and Chong.  A few critics (Roger Ebert, especially) thought that this was an important (!) film, because the lead characters were Asian and Indian, and that it was historically signficant because of casting ethnic minorities.  That theory is actually funnier than the movie itself.  This is a really ordinary stoner flick.  The fact that the 2 main characters aren't white doesn't make the film important or groundbreaking (please!).  Cheech is Mexican, and Chong is part Chinese, so was Up in Smoke a groundbreaking film?  No!  Up in Smoke was about two stoners, and so is this one.  For the record, Up in Smoke is light years funnier than this film.  This film is nothing special, but it has no pretensions on being a boundary shattering film.</p></body></html>

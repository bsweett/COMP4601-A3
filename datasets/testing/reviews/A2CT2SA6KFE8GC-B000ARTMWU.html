Sorry about that awful and pitiful attempt at a pun, but I didn't really know how else to start this review.  Coming from the land of Lattes, Pepe LePew and croissants, this film is actually pretty good considering it's a newer horror film.  Plotwise it's not terribly original, but it's pulled off with style and never becomes boring considering most of the film is a cat and mouse game.  There isn't a very high body count, but the murders are especially graphic and look quite realistic actually.  The blood really looks like blood in this film.  I catch a big Dario Argento influence to the whole thing.  Basically we have two women who are witnesses to a brutal slaying of one of the girl's parents.  The killer kidnaps the daughter, binds her and throws her into the back of his truck to take her to God knows where to do God knows what with her.  The second girl sneaks aboard the truck and basically tries to free her friend without arousing the killer's suspicion.  This constant dodging of the killer is what leads to the moments of High Tension.  Plotwise it's similar to the book Intensity by Dean Koontz if you've ever read that.  Many folks despise the "Twist" of this film.  I won't pretend to understand it either, coz it does defy all laws of physics, but if you really want to analyze it deeply, you can probably find something more to it.  I won't waste my time doing that though.  I found it entertaining enough, and could just accept it as implausible as it is.  Highly recommended if you're like me and all but given up on the state of the horror genre anymore.  Take the plunge!  Check it out!  D'accord?</p></body></html>

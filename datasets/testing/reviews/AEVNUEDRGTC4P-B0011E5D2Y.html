<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie That Inspired Poor Behavior"></head><body><p>The Wedding Crashers is a case of a good movie that inspired a rude fad. The movie itself is very funny and is a good comedy. However, it inspired all sorts of copycat behavior. As a result, many weddings came to need such expensive accoutrements such as extra security and sending tickets for admission in the wedding invitations.<br /><br />The Wedding Crashers comes well recommended provided that you don't try any wedding crashing yourself.</p></body></html>

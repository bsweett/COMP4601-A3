Although it has flaws, it has always been among my favorite films.<br /><br />This version misses virtually every important point behind the original, and is nothing more than a sloppy, stupid, and ultimately incoherent mess.<br /><br />I really don't want to waste a single second more on this review.  See the original.  Please.</p></body></html>

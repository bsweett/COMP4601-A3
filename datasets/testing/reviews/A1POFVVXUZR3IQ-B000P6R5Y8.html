<meta name="summary" content="A stirring story about friendship, compassion, empathy, and much more"></head><body><p>I had never read Katherine Paterson's YA novel of the same name and when I came across this DVD at my local library, I was captivated by the synopsis and decided to view it with my seven-year old daughter.<br /><br />The film adaptation is beautifully done, and most of the credit goes to the two young stars who play the central characters. Fifth grader Jesse (Josh Hutcherson, who was also in [[ASIN:B000DBHX4M Zathura (Special Edition)]) lives out in the country with his parents and four siblings (two older sisters who could not give him the time of day, a baby sister, and a very young Bailee Madison playing eight-year-old May Belle). Jesse's family barely scrapes by on the meager wages brought in by his dad (Robert Patrick) who works at a hardware store and also grows vegetables which he then sells to make ends meet. Jesse's relationship with his dad is tense because the older man is strict and consumed by his own financial worries. Jesse is also a loner at school, finding himself without any real friend. Jesse's only solace is his art and portfolio of drawings.<br /><br />Then a new family moves in next door and Jesse's entire perspective on life changes. Leslie (Anna Sophia Robb) is lovely, confident, and possessed of a sunny disposition. There's nothing that fazes this young girl, not the resident school bully, a surly eighth grader, nor anyone else who tries to ruffle her good nature. Soon Leslie befriends Jesse and the pair find they are both blessed with great imagination. The pair find their very own refuge from the outside world in a part of the woods that seems to have been forgotten by the rest of humanity. Here the pair really give free rein to their fantasy and imaginations, creating a hideaway in a magical land they nickname Terabithia.<br /><br />Inevitably, harsh reality intrudes in the form of tragedy, and the rest of the story focuses on how one of the main characters forges ahead despite grief and a sense of loss. This heartwarming, inspiring, and heartbreaking story makes for wonderful family entertainment. My daughter and I had an interesting discussion after the movie ended about some of the themes in the movie such as compassion, empathy, and friendship. Recommended!</p></body></html>

The cast is uniformly excellent (surprised at no recognition for Davis and Paltrow at award time).<br /><br />Anyway this unfolds like a mystery and surrounds itself with a hint of depressed madness.  Dour sounding - but it's not.  Gyllenhall brings great energy to his scenes and Hopkins is all demented gusto.<br /><br />If you are looking for a thought-proking piece of drama, stop here.</p></body></html>

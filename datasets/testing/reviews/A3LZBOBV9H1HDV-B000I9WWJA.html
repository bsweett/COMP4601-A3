Denzel Washington (two-time Oscar winner) as Keith Frazier, Clive Owen (a Oscar nominee) as Dalton Russell, & Jodie Foster (two-time Oscar winner) as Madeline White, brilliantly lead the all-star cast that also features Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe (two-time Oscar nominee), & Chiwetel Ejiofor! One of the year's best! Spike Lee's (two-time Oscar nominee) directing is excellent (This is the fourth movie with Denzel), this is one of his best films to date! The story & screenplay by Russell Gewirtz is brilliant! The music by Terence Blanchard (the composer that Lee has worked with for nearly all of his films) is brilliant! The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who did the cinematography to Lee's "She Hate Me" (2004) is excellent! The film editing by Barry Alexander Brown (the editor that Lee has worked for nearly all of his films) is excellent! The casting by Kim Coleman (who did the casting to Lee's "She Hate Me" (2004) is excellent! The production design by Wynn Thomas (who has done the production design to 5 of Lee's movies, most recently "The Original Kings of Comedy" (2000) is excellent! The art direction by Chris Shriver (one of the art directors on Lee's "Malcolm X" (1992) is excellent! The set decoration by George DeTitta Jr. is excellent! The costume design by Donna Berwick (who did the costume design to Lee's "She Hate Me" (2004) is excellent! This is one of the intelligent, brilliant crime thrillers in years! This is smart, imaginative, and well-made!</p></body></html>

I mention this because Sofia's career path is following a similar trajectory as her father's.  With this film and "The Virgin Suicides" and "Lost in Translation"(which I didn't get) Sofia is not yet on equal footing as her father but she has established herself as a talent to be reckoned with.  "Marie Antoinette" is not a great film but most certainly it's an interesting one.  The intent here is to portray the notorious Queen of France in a sympathetic light.  The film follows her from the time she was a callow teenager born of Austrian nobility forced into a loveless marriage of convenience to the Dauphin of France till her inevitable fate with the guillotine.  Kirsten Dunst, always a formidable actress, probably gives her best performance ever in portraying the evolution of her character.  Jason Schwartzmann, in what could have been a totally unsympathetic role, engenders some empathy for Louis.  The great Rip Torn gives a lusty turn as the King of France.  The decor is sumptuous and the Oscar winning costumes are breathtaking.  The film's lone glaring debit is the intermittent use of latter day pop music.  Really, Sofia, what place does Bow Wow Wow's "I Want Candy" have in the Eighteenth Century?  That quibble aside "Marie Antoinette" is a worthwhile viewing experience.</p></body></html>

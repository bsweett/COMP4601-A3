He wears track suits every day and has a sexy young girlfriend who leaves him at the beginning of the film. When he receives a mysterious letter that claims that he is the father of an adult son he never knew existed he doesn't know if the letter is a hoax or if he really has a son out there. His Jamaican friend Winston (Jeffrey Wright) is intrigued by the mysterious letter and relentlessly urges Don Johnston (Murray's character), to pursue the women he was with at the time to find out if he really has a son out there.<br /><br />Broken Flowers is an intriguing film about a subject matter that is constantly in the tabloids and on daytime television. Bill Murray once again offers an excellent dead pan on performance as Don Johnston who seems to careless about solving the mystery. When he finally cleans himself up and sets out to find the women from his past the story really heats up. Broken Flowers features Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton.</p></body></html>

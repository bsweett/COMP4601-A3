<meta name="summary" content="Pathetic Gangster Style Movie"></head><body><p>I've read a lot of reviews for this movie stating that it is an excellent film and some even call it one of the best movies of all time.  I couldn't disagree more.  I found this film to be a disappointment.  Tom Hanks & period-gangster style films just don't go together.  When I see Tom Hanks, I see him in Big.. not as a serious actor.  In "Road To Perdition" Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a born and bred gangster in the 1930's, who is forced to abandon his lifestyle when his wife and one of his sons are killed and he is forced to protect the elder son, a witness of a killing.  The story does leave something to be desired. Predictable and hackneyed plot, with pretty weak story development.  I'm a big fan of movies like the Godfather & Goodfellas but this one just plain stinks.</p></body></html>

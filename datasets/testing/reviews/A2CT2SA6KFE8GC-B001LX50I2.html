Manhunter and Silence were enough.  Overdosing on Hannibal Lecter makes him less and less scary(Hellraiser suffered the same fate in the sequels by desensitizing us to Pinhead).  My main gripe withh this is the same as most reviewers that gave this a negative review: Edward Norton.  As much as I admire Edward Norton, he was just a bad choice.  That character called for someone totally different.  I think I speak for most people when I say that when reading the book, you don't picture anyone remotely like Edward Norton as Graham.  Ralph Fiennes was okay I guess.  Emily Watson was decent with her extremely cutesy , wild googily eyed look.  Keitel was there just coz they needed an older stern looking guy for Crawford(I guess Scott Glen wasn't available this time).  People knock Keitel in this, but I think he did what he could with the not-so-demanding role of Jack Crawford.  Hoffman was completely wrong for Lounds.  This movie wasn't terrible or anything(that title goes to Hannibal), but it has a very strong &quot;been there, done that&quot; vibe going on all through it.  I think it was very late in the game to make this film, coz it offers nothing that we didn't already see in Silence Of The Lambs or Manhunter(if you saw that one!).</p></body></html>

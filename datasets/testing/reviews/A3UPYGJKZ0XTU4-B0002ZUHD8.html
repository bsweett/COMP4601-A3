Although King Arthur's legend gained popularity in the late Middle Ages, it refers to the exploits of an unknown warrior-king in Britain of late antiquity. In "King Arthur", screenwriter David Franzoni makes Arthur out to be a Roman-Briton Commander of a group of Sarmatian knights who act as a sort of special forces unit to protect Roman interests in 5th century Britain. As the Roman Empire plans to pull out of Britain, leaving the native population and invading Saxons to fight it out, the visiting Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti) gives Arthur (Clive Owen) a final order. He and his 6 knights are to escort a Roman family to safety whose estate is in the path of the Saxon General Cerdic's (Stellan Skarsgard) ruthless advance. The Woads (normally called Picts), a Celtic people whose relentless attacks have Rome on the run, share Arthur's disdain for the Saxons. So politics makes strange bedfellows, then as it does now.<br /><br />Contrary to the film's hype, "King Arthur" isn't attempting to be historically accurate. Although it is generally accepted that the source of Arthurian legend was a king and/or military leader of late antiquity, the identity of this person is hotly disputed. To my knowledge, there are 3 major schools of thought on the subject and some minor ones. King Arthur is thought to have been either: Lucius Artorius Castus, a 2nd century Roman stationed at Hadrian's wall who commanded a group of Sarmatian cavalry, as King Arthur does in this movie. Or, Ambrosius Aurelianus, who led the pivotal defeat of the Saxons at Badon Hill circa 500 A.D., as Arthur does here. Or, Riothamus, a 5th century British king. King Arthur is an amalgamated legend, in the way that the legends of Robin Hood or Black Beard started with one person and were amended with the exploits of others as the centuries passed. The fact that Sarmatians were cavalry and their tradition of being buried with their swords at the head of the grave leads one to believe that these warriors were, indeed, the inspiration for much of the mythology surrounding knights of the realm. The legendary King Arthur won 12 battles, including the Battle of Badon Hill, as Ambrosius Aurelianus did. These 2 men, who lived 3 centuries apart, are both Arthur. But the story, itself, that is presented in "King Arthur" is fiction.<br /><br />As for the movie, "King Arthur" may be the murkiest film I have ever seen. Many scenes take place at night., but those in daylight aren't much brighter. I might have wondered how it is possible to make a snowscape dark, if I had not learned from the bonus features that it was done with CGI. It's unfortunate that so much detail is hidden in shadow, but it does create an oppressive effect. Britain looks very cold and very dark in every frame. The blue body dye that the Picts traditionally donned in battle is one of those little pieces of history that just begs to be filmed. But it would have had more visual impact had the lighting been more realistic. The Picts actually didn't wear clothes with their paint, and why they are called "Woads" in this film is a mystery to me.<br /><br />"King Arthur"'s performances are fine but unremarkable. The knights are probably the most interesting characters, but they are usually in the periphery. Acclaimed character actor Ray Winstone entertains with a nice over-the-top performance of Bors, the loudest knight. Some fine European actors were corralled for foreign roles, but they are given little to do. The fabulous Stellan Skarsgard is the Saxon General Cerdic. I've always thought that Skarsgard could make any character believable, and maybe he does as much with Cerdic's few lines as is possible. Somehow he gives the man weight by whispering all the time. But Cerdic still comes across as a one-dimensional villain -although a scary one.<br /><br />There is a lot of very modern talk of "freedom". As is common in period pieces, these are conspicuously contemporary characters in an ancient drama. So "King Arthur" is not intended to be a historical document. Its grittiness and modern ideals turn the shiny Arthurian legend on its end and attempt to create an interpretation of the myth that strikes a chord in the 21st century. I don't think it succeeds in that. The script just isn't very good, the characters poorly drawn, their actions incomprehensible, the situations implausible, and the whole thing is drab and overprocessed. But "King Arthur" is an  action film, even if it isn't anything more, and I enjoyed it at that level.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary, a roundtable discussion with cast and crew, an alternate ending, an optional trivia track while viewing the film, a photo gallery, and an audio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua. In "Blood on the Land: Forging King Arthur" (18 minutes) the cast, principle crew, director Antoine Fuqua, and a historical consultant comment on the origins of the King Arthur legend, the film's characters, and the sets. "Cast & Filmmaker Roundtable" (16 minutes) is a discussion of Arthurian legend, the movie, and filming by screenwriter David Fanzoni, Keira Knightley, Clive Owen, director Antoine Fuqua, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), and Hugh Dancy (Galahad). The "Alternate Ending: Badon Hill" (4 minutes) puts a slightly different philosophical spin on the death of the knights in battle. It's too contrived, even for a fairy tale. Skip it. "Knight Vision" allows you to enable an optional track of subtitles that provide production and historical trivia during the movie. The "Producer's Photo Gallery" includes color and black-and-white stills. If you insert th DVD into your XBox, you can view a "King Arthur XBox Game Demo". In the audio commentary, director Antoine Fuqua talks about making the film and the meaning that the story of King Arthur holds for him.</p></body></html>

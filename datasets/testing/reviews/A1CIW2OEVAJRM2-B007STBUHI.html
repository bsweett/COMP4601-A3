<meta name="summary" content="A movie that grabs you by the teeth."></head><body><p>Amity is a small beach town that thrives on summer tourists, where the Chief of Police's biggest worry are kids practicing karate on neighbourhood fences.  Until a great-white shark arrives and starts killing beach-goers.  His new worry is how to get rid of a man-eating shark.  That's the basic premise of Peter Benchley's famous novel, brought to screen by Steven Spielberg with some major changes to the plot.  The plot consists of two halves: the first half describing the shark threat, and the second half describing the shark hunt.  The first half is the most enjoyable, as director Spielberg evokes a sense of fear from the outset with the gruesome discovery of the remains of a shark victim.  There is a constant and strong sense of impending doom: "who will be next?"  <p>Unlike most modern movies, the fear that "Jaws" creates is not produced by graphic displays of blood and gore, which are reserved for the conclusion of the shark hunt in the closing stages of the movie.  In fact you don't even see the details of the first attack or the body of the first victim, and very little of the shark or its victims is seen in the first half of the movie.  Rather, splendid directing creates an emotional fear with small and brilliant touches throughout.  After a few false alarms on the beach, we as viewers start seeing the beach-goers as "shark bait" through the eyes of the Chief of Police and share his fear.  A most memorable scene occurs as the camera pans between him and the swimmers in the surf, and as he reacts first to an apparent shark which turns out to be an elderly swimmer, and then to the screams of a young couple which turn out to be innocent screams of fun.  Similarly, there are other scenes where his wife surprises him as he is looking at a book with pictures of sharks; and where the camera zooms in on a shark attack and pans out to show it is just a killer-shark video game.  Creating chilling fear in this emotional manner by suggestion rather than by sight of explicit gore is a skill that has largely been lost by modern movie-makers.  Fear is evoked more by what you don't see than what you do see.  John Williams impressive score with its recurring shark theme turns up the chills all the higher.<p>The second half of the movie does not quite live up to the promise of the first half, as the shark hunt gets underway, complete with the memorable line "You're going to need a bigger boat."  But here two wonderful characters come to the forefront to join the police chief in the quest for the shark: the kooky shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), and the eccentric shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) who is humorously and completely impersonal in his passion for sharks.  The conclusion is rather more graphic than a PG rating would suggest, but is quite satisfying.  (The PG rating is overly generous by today's standards, considering the incidences of blasphemy and graphic violence, particularly in the latter half).<p>It's not hard to see why this is a landmark movie continues to stand out more than 25 years after it was made.  It's dated only in that it pictures people with 70s clothes and hair, and an artificial shark produced by 70s technology.  But there is certainly nothing old-fashioned about the sense of terror and suspense it evokes.  It is this spine-tingling atmosphere that has made the chilling story of "Jaws" an unforgettable classic that will continue to grab viewers by the teeth in years to come.</p></body></html>

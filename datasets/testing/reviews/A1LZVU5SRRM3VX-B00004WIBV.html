<meta name="summary" content="Burton Puts His Own, Unique Stamp on The Classic Legend"></head><body><p>As he did with Batman and Planet of the Apes (and is reportedly doing with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) Tim Burton has taken a classic story and placed his own unique stamp on it. The atmosphere and sets are classic Burton, especially the gnarled and nightmarish trees that surround and define an important part of the collective psyche of Sleepy Hollow.  <p>Johnny Depp (as Constable Ichabod Crane) displays his skill at portraying a character who is both humorous and earnest in this adaptation, applying Burton's concept of 19th century forensic equipment to the task of uncovering the origin of the mysterious circumstances that are causing people to lose their heads in the small village...literally. <p>For the most part, the supporting cast is also marvelous, from the voluptuous Christina Ricci to Miranda Richardson to Christopher Lee and Ian McDiarmid, just to name a few.  <p>The only person who seems miscast in this Burton fable is Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman.  Come on, Mr. Burton, just because you have given Walken pointy prosthetic teeth and the ability to ride his supernatural steed out of a gnarled old tree, are we supposed to be frightened?  The only thing frightening about Walken is his general lack of acting ability. Then again, Mr. Burton has always approached macabre subject matter with a dark sense of humor, so perhaps this casting is intended to be as tongue-in-cheek as the &quot;scientific instruments&quot; that Depp's Ichabod uses to practice his detective work. <p>If one went into the film not knowing that it was a Burton creation, one might come out of the film scratching one's head over the visual treatment of the story.  Since Burton has trained the viewer to expect a slightly exaggerated and off-beat style, however, the look and feel of the film should not come as a great surprise to anyone who is familiar with Burton's previous work.  In fact, for the most part, Burton shows great restraint in crafting most of the characters to be unusual, but not as over-the-top as, for example, his characters in Mars Attacks!<p>Best watched around Halloween, Sleepy Hollow is an entertaining ride through a &quot;nightmare&quot; with a distinctly Burton-esque feel.</p></body></html>

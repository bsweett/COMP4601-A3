<meta name="summary" content="Excellent filmography..."></head><body><p>This is one of the better movies that I have seen in sometime, although it does not hold a candle to the much similar A Beautiful Mind...Paltrow and company do a wonderful job with the material in this one...it is gripping, interesting, something that you will watch with wonder. I felt attached to most of the characters in this movie, and I felt as though I was really in for a ride with them at every step of the way...great movie, not to be missed....")</p></body></html>

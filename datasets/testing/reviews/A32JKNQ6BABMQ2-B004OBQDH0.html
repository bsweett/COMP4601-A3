<meta name="summary" content="my favorite movie of 2010"></head><body><p>this was by far the darkest chapter in the harry potter series yet.it reminded me of "empire strikes back" or "revenge of the sith" in that it was a family film that took a very dark turn.<br />  the kids have to carry around a trinket for a while that makes them turn on eachother.it reminded me of "lord of the rings" and the hobbitts with the ring.<br />  it was not my favorite part.my favorite part was "prisoner of azkaban".although,i would rank it in the top half along with "the half blood prince"<br /><br />  i say it is a good movie.the only harry potter movie to be my favorite for an entire year.yes the movie industry is going to crap but this was still the winner.<br />  now id like to address all the ill informed misfits out there about something.i hear a lot of people saying that harry potter is evil.they say just because the kids are at a school learning magic,that they must be satanic.well,magic is magic and satanism is satanism .they are 2 entirely different things.some of the wiccans and celts and such belive there isnt even a devil at all.others still belive that he is real but they belive he is pure evil and they sure as crap dont worship him.any idiot in the multiverse knows that.so i say to these uninformed misfits....GET A LIFE AND THEN AN EDUCATION.......ITS this same of short cuts to thinking that caused the inquisition.<br />  its just a bunch of family movies.nothing to run away from.kids playing with sticks and casting spells that make spiders walk on roller skates and stuff.</p></body></html>

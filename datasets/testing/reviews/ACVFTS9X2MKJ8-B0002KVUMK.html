<meta name="summary" content=""Stop the roller coaster!  I'm bored to death!!""></head><body><p>When movies are described as a "roller coaster ride", or just a "non-stop thrill ride", I already suspect that this is just another movie that will give me a headache.<br /><br />When is Hollywood going to figure it out that making movies with too many special effects, and very little comprehensive drama, ends up being a very disatisfying experience for the viewer?!  Many unnecessary special effects were thrown in just so someone who enjoys creating special effects can "show off" his particular animation talent.<br /><br />When compared to an actual roller coaster, yes, the results can seem to be the same.  Usually a "thrilling roller coaster ride" is only about an honest minute and a half.  You don't want to be on a roller coaster for two hours.  That's what this overkill "roller coaster ride" of a movie does to people like me.  If you're like me, you'll definitely be bored to tears before the "ride" is over.<br /><br />If this movie was written word-for-word as a book, the contents of the story would be very bleak.  Van Helsing, written here, is a pretty bland story.  A loud, "in your face" display of absolutely nothing interesting!  The movie "Twister" was the same way.  All visual, but no real story.<br /><br />"Your reputation precedes you..."  Nobody in real life talks like that, but Hollywood seems to think that's a cool line.  I hear it in movies alot.  In fact, this film has alot of cliches' of films of the past which continues to prove it's lack of originality.<br /><br />And, what's more, they couldn't have picked a more boring, uninteresting actor to play "Dracula".  What is he, a "she-male" or something?  Realistically, Dracula should have been more handsome and charismatic, the way Bram Stoker (the writer and creator of the original "Dracula" written in 1897) perceived him to be.  This Richard Roxburgh as Dracula definitely contributed more to the non-appeal of this film.<br /><br />Come on, honestly, is this the limit of comprehensive imagination?  Does "character development" make you feel like you're having to learn more about a character that you really want to?  The absence of "character development" makes it so that you don't care what happens to anyone in the film.  "Kill him off!", "Kill her off, too!"  Who cares?  We didn't get a chance to know the character anyway.<br /><br />I was really hoping to enjoy this film because I love "gothic artwork".  The still scenes in this film really were very beautiful.  But, it wasn't enough to save this "lame" film.</p></body></html>

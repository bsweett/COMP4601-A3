<meta name="summary" content="A terrific ending to one of animation's most beloved trilogies"></head><body><p>All Things Must Change. That seems to be the main message to the third & final Toy Story movie. As fans have waited eleven years for the next sequel, the sequel itself has noted the passage of time...Andy is now a young man & ready to go off to college. His toys--whom he has outgrown--are despondent that Andy no longer plays with them. So it's up to the attic as storage for the toys; except a terrible mistake sends the gang to a pre-school called Sunnyside. Thinking the place is a new life for them, they soon learn they've been duped: The place is a prison, a living nightmare as they are caged at night & put at the mercy of ruthless toddlers during the day. This is where the storyline becomes surprisingly dark as Woody returns to rescue his friends & hatch sort of a "Mission Impossible": Get everyone past security, "all-seeing monkeys", and all kinds of obstacles so they can be reunited with their owner.<br />Disney-Pixar just never ceases to amaze me. The first two films were oh-so-imaginative & clever--with the trademark Disney "heart"--but this one pulls out all the stops. It's full of thrilling, almost suspenseful twists & turns, humor & powerfully emotional moments. And what can I say about the animation that hasn't been said? It's simply wonderful. The voice talent, as usual, is superb. Veteran actor Ned Beatty turns in a good performance as Lotso, the bear that's cuddly & sweet-smelling on the outside, but hides a dark heart of cruel villainy inside. Michael Keaton also has some wonderfully hammy moments as Ken.<br />There's the usual satiric toy humor here, but what will probably get to you are the heart-wrenching moments. Namely, when the gang finds themselves hopelessly staring death in the face, and touchingly holding hands as the end draws near; and the finale, as Andy donates his toys to a sweet little girl down the street, allowing himself one last play with his "old pals" before heading to college. It's a fitting ending to a charming trilogy.<br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

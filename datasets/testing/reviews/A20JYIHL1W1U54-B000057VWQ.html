<meta name="summary" content="All that is Good in Our Lives"></head><body><p>This Frank Capra film is a perennial classic full of emotion and warmth. I do not find it depressing as some people do. Instead, it is reflective and pensive on the good that is all around us yet we never truly see. The film is a celebration of all that is good in our lives and the performances ring true to that end. I only wish Dimitri Tiomkin's score had not been truncated before the film's release. Yet most important is the film's true meaning and there it is indelibly endearing and sincere.  Frank Capra's images are indelible and the print of this DVD is outstanding.</p></body></html>

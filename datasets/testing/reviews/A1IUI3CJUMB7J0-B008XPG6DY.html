<meta name="summary" content="I guess it's enertaining overall but the acting is bad"></head><body><p>While you watch it you think to yourself is this a  good or bad movie am I entertained or not. At the end of the film i found out I was entertained but the acting was not good and the film is slow at times. I would say it's entertaing becouse of the twist and turns in the movie even though I guess it half way through the film. The plot is good and remindes you of a early 90's fatel attraction type film. The acting is the downfall of the film Jennifer Anistion is bad and Clive Owen is boring the abd guessa re entertaning. I had no intrest to see the filma nd then I was enjoyed by it so overall i would recomend it.</p></body></html>

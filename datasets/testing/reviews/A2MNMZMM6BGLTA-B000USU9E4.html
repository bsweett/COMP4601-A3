<meta name="summary" content="Affleck and Jackson... Pile One More On The Garbage Heap."></head><body><p>How Ben Affleck has ever gotten to be a 'star' in Hollywood is beyond me. I did like him as George Reeves in the Superman movie but for god sake... this guy is like a piece of notty pine. He is just plain horrible as an actor. He should stick to kissing Kevin Smiths butt and being in his stupid movies because he is a bad actor.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson was funny at first. But his cussing and shouting gimmick has really gotten old.<br /><br />This movie is predictable, simple and just a bore.</p></body></html>

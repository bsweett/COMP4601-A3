<meta name="summary" content="HAPPY GROUNDHOG DAY!!!"></head><body><p>In honor of today actually being Groundhog Day, I thought I'd write this review. This movie is very funny. Bill Murray stars as a self-centered TV meteorologist named Phil Connors. After dissing his assignment and his crew, he finds that he keeps living the same day over and over again. Will this make Phil learn his lesson and teach him the error of his ways? I highly recommend GROUNDHOG DAY!!!</p></body></html>

When she was tragically killed it hit me (just like millions and millions of people around the world) very hard. She was so beautiful on the outside and on the inside. She was also very unique, because (perhaps?) she was the only member of this crazy family, the royals that had a heart and soul.<br /><br />"The Queen" stars legendary veteran actress Helen Mirren who plays the title role. "The Queen" deals with both the public's reaction to Princess Diana's tragic death, as well as the Queen's/royal family's cold and unsympathetic feelings towards this tragedy.<br /><br />I am not sure if the producers of "The Queen" were trying to shed a positive light on Queen Elizabeth? If they were though, it would have been nice if they would have discussed her life in greater detail so the viewers could gain a better understanding in to this complex individual.<br /><br />But after watching this picture I really believe that the Queen is a very cold person. She is more interested in what the press has to say about her and her family, but she is never seen comforting her grandchildren or even talking to them!<br /><br />Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen was really scary because she looked just like her! I have no idea how the Queen behaves in private but I can only suspect that Helen Mirren was really on the money because she acted just the way most people would probably expect the Queen to behave.<br /><br />Michael Sheen played the newly elected Tony Blair. Did anyone else find it odd that a prime minister of one of the richest countries in the world was portrayed as a desperately middle-class man in a very middle-class home? I found that very unrealistic.<br /><br />Tony Blair tried to evoke some type of humanity into the Queen after it was apparent to the British people that she did not give a hoot about poor Princess Diana. He even acted as publicity agent, spinning stories about the Queen's departure from London and tight-lipped stance. It seemed that he was trying to play both sides of the fence though, although he did win much brownie points for his involvement during this tragic time in British history.<br /><br />I found the performance of Helen McCrory (playing Mrs. Cherie Blair) to be top-notch as well. She was very comical in many scenes (her curtsey to the Queen was so different), and she also lent a little bit of realism to this picture. Because as Cherie described, the Queen and her entire family are a bunch of emotionally retarded people.<br /><br />Princess Diana was the most famous women in the world. Is that why the Windsors disliked her? I can only suspect that the reasons why the public (and the world, alike) loved her so much were the same reasons why the royal family detested her. Such a shame...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good but a confusing mess"></head><body><p>As a sequal to the original movie "Pitch Black" this movie was completely different. It didn't follow the thread of the first one at all. Riddick's character is different, and there are too many things that are not explained. Just thrown out there for the public to make of it what they will. Such as Riddick's feelings for Kera, or where the Necromongers came from in the first place. Why did they just of a sudden pop up in the universe? Other than that, the movie was not too bad. The actors where ok, not great, just ok. The planets where pretty cool, especially the prison on the one sun where Kera was held. But the movie certainly did not showcase the best of Vin Diesel's talents. His lines left you pretty unsure at what they where trying to get at, or why he even bothered saying them.<br /><br />Definatly better than the first one however, at least you could watch it a second time without being bored because you knew the entire plot. Still, it tended to drag. I think Twohy went for two hours without first wondering how he was going to do it and make it stay interesting. Make sure you rent this movie first before committing to buying, unless you saw and liked the original.</p></body></html>

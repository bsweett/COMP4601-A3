<meta name="summary" content="Way Too Predictable"></head><body><p>I had never heard of this movie prior to watching it so I had no expectations at all.  After the first 15 minutes I realized what a predictable plot it was.  There's no surprises in this film, at all.  This is another "horror" film that isn't scary, isn't original in any way, and doesn't have any particular redeeming value whatsoever. It's shot like a typical commercial or music video director would shoot, and the story suffers in the same way - there is no real character development and no dramatic development to sustain a feature length.  The only attempts at humanizing the film are so utterly misplaced as to be absurd or laughable. It's a one note movie and that note is one that really ought to leave it's audience feeling disgusted at the end - not because of the gore, but because of the utter waste of time we have been subjected to.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best "Threequels" You Could Hope to Find"></head><body><p>I grew up with the characters of Toy Story; the first film being released when I was 3, the second when I was 7, and the third months after I turned 18. With that in mind, it's worth noting that there's an added pathos to the proceedings in that regard. Toy Story 3 is Pixar's conclusion to their Toy Story films and while many studios could have just made a cash-grab based on an established name, Pixar has produced one of the best "threequels" you could hope to find. The film is the highest grossing movie of 2010 and it's been established by audiences and critics that saying a negative word about it is hearsay; but, luckily, that's not necessary here.<br /><br />Andy is now all grown up and off to college, while his favorite toys have been cast off into the toybox hoping for the off-chance that Andy will play with them again. Planning to take his favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) to college with him and putting the rest of the gang in the attic, a mistake leads all the toys to end up at Sunnyside Daycare. A new villain emerges as the soft-spoken, purple teddy bear Lotso (voiced by Ned Beatty) along with his henchmen Big Baby and Ken (Michael Keaton).<br /><br />All of the main characters and voice cast from the previous two films return (with the exception of the late Jim Varney) and none of the charm of the original films has been lost. The toys really take center stage in this film, with very little human involvement this time around. In terms of storytelling quality and execution, Toy Story 3 is exactly what you'd come to expect from Pixar studios. Endlessly creative in their endeavors, I found the new toy additions brilliantly used (my favorites being Chuckles the Clown and the "eye in the sky" Monkey).<br /><br />It's a wonderfully creative film that I enjoyed even more the second time around. It's got a witty, poignant script by Oscar-winning screenwriter Michael Arndt ('Little Miss Sunshine'), sight gags that are as amusing as ever, and voice work by actors who haved stayed with these characters for over 15 years yet never lose their energy and flair. The latest voice actors to join are particularly good, notably Ned Beatty, alternating between comforting and sinister and Michael Keaton, a total scene-stealer.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, growing up with these films in the way I have has added a significant amount of pathos. This is not more apparent than it is at the film's conclusion. The conclusion of Toy Story 3 is one of the most heartwrenching scenes I've ever encountered in an animated film. It may be because it seems symbolic of my own childhood ending or that it's just a really well-executed conclusion, but whatever the case...I can't help but be impressed by an animated film that nearly moves me to tears.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is not my favorite film of 2010 or even my favorite animated film of 2010, but I have to agree with the general consensus that it's one of the best films of 2010. An entertaining, amusing, exciting, crowd-pleasing close to an iconic trilogy of films that will appeal to both adults and children alike. There really isn't a negative thing to say about it.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

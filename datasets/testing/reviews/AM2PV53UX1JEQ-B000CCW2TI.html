<meta name="summary" content="NIFTY SUMMER THRILLER"></head><body><p>This simple, effective, tight little thriller is the most purely engaging and entertaining movie I've seen all summer.  The two lead performances sustain more than their share of charisma - Rachel McAdams is delightfully appealing, matched with Mr. Murphy's reptilian scariness.  The plot is full of holes, but the movie is so well-paced that you don't notice.  And it features a number of winning supporting performances, all of which round out the fun.</p></body></html>

"Inside Man" also makes some telling social observations while delivering plenty of surprises. Lee provides a fine acting ensemble (Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer) with an inventive screenplay from Russell Gewirtz and excellent cinematography by Matthew Libatique. The result is a crackerjack entertainment and one of Lee's most accomplished films.</p></body></html>

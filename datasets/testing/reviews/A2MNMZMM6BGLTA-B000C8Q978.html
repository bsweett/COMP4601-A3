It is very understated as is Bill Murrays performance but I still enjoyed it and the subject matter. This is not a real feel good movie. It deals with regrets and past loves lost. It also deals with going back and confronting your past and what you left behind and really if you are not better off leaving the past in the past. Don is a sad character and time has past him by. He is what he is and suddenly he gets a letter that makes him question who he is, how he has lived his life and that he may have a grown child out there that he doesnt even know about.<br /><br />This movie is kind of a downer but is worth a look.</p></body></html>

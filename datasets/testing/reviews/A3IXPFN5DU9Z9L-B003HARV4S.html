<meta name="summary" content="Though critically flawed, The Illusionist is still a captivating film"></head><body><p>For the first half of The Illusionist I sat spellbound, swept up in a beautifully realized world of magic and intrigue.  The film's style calls to mind the Albumen prints of the 19th century, with their soft edges and muted sepia tones. It lends the film, which is set in the waning years of the Austro-Hungarian empire, a sense of time and place as well as an atmosphere of mystery. The scenery and costumes certainly convey period authenticity. Old Vienna, with its cobblestone streets and narrow alleyways, grand theaters and resplendent mansions, really comes alive.<br /><br />Even the picturesque quality of the film could not distract me from the glaring flaws in the story. The Illusionist turns on one pivotal event and resolves with a 'twist ending' that turns this pivotal event on its head. This is not a bad thing in and of itself, but the execution, as well as the twist itself, is sub par.<br /><br />Strangely enough, the ending made me despise the character(s) I should have been rooting for, and pity the character(s) who had been served up as villains.<br /><br />The acting, for the most part, is excellent. Norton and Giamatti (who plays an ambitious and principled police detective) deliver good performances. Rufus Sewell steals scenes as the arrogant and conflicted Crown Prince Leopold. Biel's performance doesn't disappoint either, although she is badly miscast as a down-to-earth princess as well as Norton's love interest. She's nice to look at, especially in the bosom enhancing dresses they have her wear, and that was probably intended to be her primary function anyway.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, The Illusionist is a captivating film, at least the first time around. More critical viewers will have no trouble seeing through the pretty packaging on subsequent viewings, so the film will depreciate rapidly. Personally, I think "The Prestige" (which contended against The Illusionist at the box office for "Magic Dollars" ) is a much more solid work, with more staying power.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Action Classic"></head><body><p>This is a popcorn movie with smarts.  It's got everything you want in a good action flick; an average guy hero, charismatic(yet sadistic) villains, dumb beaureaucrats, and things blow up real good.  Bruce Willis established himself as a film star after his stint on "Moonlighting" and Alan Rickman introduced himself to audiences as an actor to be reckoned with.  The beauty of this movie is it's total lack of pretense outside of entertaining the audience.  Today's action film-makers can take a cue from this film.</p></body></html>

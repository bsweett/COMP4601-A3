I have to say that Chap Taylor & Michael Tolkin wrote a great story for this film. Each little thing that happened in this film had me hooked waiting on what would happen next. Also Director Roger Michell did a great job with this film; his vision for this film was great. Of course you know that the acting in this film was great, Samuel L. Jackson as always was perfect in is role as the down & out good guy who deserves better. And at the opposite end of the spectrum is the high class, highly paid lawyer who has slipped from his moral ways played perfectly by Ben Affleck.<br /><br />The story for all those who don't know is about two very late people who end up in a very bad situation. One is a down 7 out man {Jackson} who just needs to get to court to try and get his kids. The other is a lawyer {Affleck} who is running late to put the last nail in the coffin of some one who used to tryst him. Well neither gets what they want when they have an accident on the road which causes both to be very late. Jackson doesn't get any custody rights to his kid, and Affleck loses a paper he needs. It turns out Jackson's character has the paper and the two have an all out war over that little piece of paper.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it I recommend that you do, this is a very entertaining film.</p></body></html>

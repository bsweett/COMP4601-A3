<meta name="summary" content="Great character story with a twist!"></head><body><p>Nicolas Cage has been one of my favorite actors for a long time now.  He has had some stinkers recently (8MM, Bringing out the Dead) but he returns with a performance so masterful, it almost makes the earlier bombs not seem as bad.  He is forced into multiple roles in this movie and he pulls them off masterfully.<p>Cage plays Roy Waller, a con man (or Matchstick man) who works with partner Sam Rockwell to bilk people out of money to install water filter systems.  Once they have that cash, they go to the house of the suckers posing as Federal agents and gain access to their accounts to get all they own.  It's brilliant and the two work it perfectly.<p>There are a couple of hitches.  One is that Roy has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)  He has to open and close doors three times (while counting aloud) before going through them, he abhors shoes or any dirt on his carpet at home, and when he loses his medication down the drain, he goes through his entire house cleaning every square inch.  Cage plays the part perfectly; he is totally believable as a man with this condition and that speaks highly of his performance.<p>The other hitch is 14 year old Allison Lohman playing Cage's daughter from a previous marriage.  She shows up in a park to meet him and soon they are the best of friends.  She finds out eventually what he does for a living (he told her at first that he is an antique dealer) and even learns a few tricks of the trade from him.  She is a real breath of fresh air in the film and she will be making movies for years to come.<p>This film has been compared to "The Sting" many times, presumably for the ending, which does contain some surprises.  It is similar to the 1974 classic.  This time the Robert Shaw role is played by Bruce McGill.  But as you will see, this film even takes the con further, to areas that were a complete surprise to me.  It is effective, smart, funny at times, and with the performance Nicolas Cage turns in, it's a complete winner.  Cage should get some votes for best actor here.</p></body></html>

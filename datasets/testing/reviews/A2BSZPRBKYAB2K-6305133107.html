<meta name="summary" content="One of John Wayne's signature movies.  An outstanding classic!"></head><body><p>This is John Wayne at his best.  The Searchers is the ultimate role for the actor and what a movie it is.  The excellent directed John Ford was at his best when he directed this movie and this is one of the 100 best films of all time according to AFI.  It is easy to see why.  A great plot that keeps the viewer interested from the opening scene to the last scene.  Great acting by awesome actors and actresses, beautiful landscapes, are just a few of the highlights of this movie.  The ultimate collection has alot of great things.  From production cards, commentary, and previews.  This collection is a must for any John Wayne, western movie fan.  I can't recommend this movie highly enough.</p></body></html>

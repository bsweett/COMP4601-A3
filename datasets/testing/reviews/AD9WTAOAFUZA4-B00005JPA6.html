<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film of 2006"></head><body><p>"Pan's Labyrinth" is one of those rare films that stays with you long after you leave the theater. In my 40 years of movie-going, few films have ever managed to dig themselves deep into my subconscious, let alone stay there for months.  This is one of those inspired movies that will be acclaimed a classic by generations to come.  Unlike last year's uber-movies (The Departed, Dreamgirls) or sweet-n-sappy-love-fests (Little Miss Sunshine), Pan's Labyrinth is a mystical tour-de-force that combines pure escapism with raw emotional intensity to create an indelible story of loss and redemption.  Ivana Baquero deserved an Academy Award nomination for her amazing and inspired performance, and the film certainly deserved the Oscar as Foreign Language Film - it was do good, I dare say even Scorcese should have lost the award to the non-nominee Del Toro, and it stands heads and shoulders above "The Departed" as a pure movie experience you will never forget.  See it in a theater for maximum impact; and if you dare to buy the dvd, be prepared for PAN to become one of your finest movie watching experiences ever.</p></body></html>

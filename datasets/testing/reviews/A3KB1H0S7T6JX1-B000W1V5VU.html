<meta name="summary" content="It's back to Vegas!"></head><body><p>Ocean's Thirteen takes place after Ocean's Twelve returned from their European heist.<br />This time the target is Las Vegas' finest: Willy Bank.  Up against such overwhelming odds Ocean has to ally with someone he never thought possible...<br />George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Al Pacino, Elliott Gould, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few laughs.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!<br />In short, Ocean's Thirteen is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection along with the other two in the trilogy!</p></body></html>

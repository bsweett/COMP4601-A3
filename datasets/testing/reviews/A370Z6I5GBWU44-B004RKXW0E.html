I hope there's no more movies after this, because while this movie was good, the ending was bittersweet and somewhat dissatisfying and there were a couple of rather dark moments (the previous two movies would be appropriate for little kids, but this one is definitely for kids who are a bit older, or for those of us old enough to have seen Toy Story 1 when it first premiered over ten years ago.<br /><br />There were a lot of great characters, lines, and action sequences. There's a lot of funny stuff going on - Andy's imaginative opening scene where the toys were portrayed in a real Wild West atmosphere, various day care scenes, and the escape scene, along with Barbie and Ken getting together.<br /><br />This movie would have been five stars if not for the message conveyed at the ending. Yes, I'm all for donating unwanted toys or passing them down to a younger generation, but I still have a couple of toys from my childhood though most have been given away to younger cousins or donated. For Andy to do what he did to Woody somehow cheapened the times he shared with Woody.  Sure, Woody would probably be lonely at college, but the message conveyed by the ending of the film is that we have to like, give it all away. Sometimes having something from one's childhood - or young adulthood - is a comfort and a treasure for people who have gotten older and passed various phases in life.<br /><br />If the ending had been less bittersweet, then I would give 5 stars. Nonetheless, this is still a very good movie at 4 stars and definitely worth watching.</p></body></html>

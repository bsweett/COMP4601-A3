<meta name="summary" content="Thats What You Get For Being A Vegetarian !"></head><body><p>I'd like to start off by exclaiming that Eli Roth's "HOSTEL" is by no means the "scariest movie in a decade" it could've come pretty close though if the last 20-30 minutes wasn't so un-realistic. With that said "HOSTEL" is one of the most entertaining horror films to come in a decade! Between the nudity,lots of blood,chainsaw's,surgical tools & a one or two very frightning moments i did not feel cheated by the end of this bloodbath. My only grudge is that the creampuff vegetarian boy should have been the one on the surgical table with his chest cut open & the mama's boy should have been the one to prevail! p.s. Realisticly nobody would have made it out of that nightmare!</p></body></html>

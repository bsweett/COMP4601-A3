U.S. government secret agent Scott (Val Kilmer) is dedicated, determined to get any job done his way.  That is a good thing because he is assigned to the challenge of rescuing the kidnapped daughter (Kristen Bell) of the president.  Soon he discovers plots within plots and a larger more insidious plot, and he has to get to the bottom of it.<br /><br />Overall, "Spartan" moves at a steady pace, has a interesting story with a dash of surprising twists and action sequences.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A definitive indie film takes on a family circling the drain"></head><body><p>Michael Arndt claims to have been inspired by his own family's road trips to write "Little Miss Sunshine."  If that's true, the man needs a hug, stat.<br /><br />"LMS" takes a big old bellyflop into a family held together by the barest shreds of convention.  Seething rage and resentment lurks virtually everywhere, but is masked in suburban conformity.  That is, almost every family member lets their resentment show in subtle ways, but is too strait-laced to truly let go.  Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are marvelous as the unhappily wed parents, while Paul Dano dives into teen angst with relish.  Steve Carell unexpectedly dials it down ten notches as a jilted gay Proust scholar.  If you attended a dinner party with these folks, you'd be on your second bottle of pinot by the time the salad course was finished.<br /><br />The only two free spirits in the family are Grandpa (Alan Arkin) and Olive (Abigail Breslin).  Grandpa is freed from the strictures of conformity by his age and his drug habit.  Olive is just a wonderful young person, and fortunately the story more or less revolves around her.  Breslin is enchanting as this chubby contented soul bobbing along in this sea of misery.  Without her stellar performance, "LMS" would be another glum romp through unhappiness like "The Squid and the Whale."<br /><br />But fortunately, Olive lives.  The family decides to help Olive with her dream of winning the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach.  So the family piles into the infamous yellow VW van and heads off.  Family road trips and Thanksgiving are Hollywood's two favorite excuses for getting families stressed out at each other, and "LMS" pulls no punches.  Fortunately, the humor is biting, but not savage, and you will laugh more than you will cringe.<br /><br />But you'll cringe a lot too.<br /><br />Occasionally over-written and hyper-clever (marks of a Sundance fave), "LMS" nevertheless brings the goods.  Fine acting across the board saves the film, and at the end of the day, the Hoover family has restored some dignity and sanity to the world.  Good for them.</p></body></html>

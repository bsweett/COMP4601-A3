<meta name="summary" content="Not really true to the book but still an enjoyable thriller"></head><body><p>Based on the bestseller by the late Robert Ludlum and executive produced by Ludlum and Frank Marshall, THE BOURNE IDENTITY pares down the book and 1988 miniseries while updating the story for the 21st century. For the few thriller fans in the world who haven't read the book the basic story appears rather old: an amnesiac struggling to learn his real identity, while predictably being pursued by people who want him dead. Director Doug Liman's (GO, SWINGERS) first attempt at an action thriller is fairly good with some spectacular stunt work and an OK performance from Franka Portene (RUN LOLA RUN). Julia Stiles also has what is basically a glorifed cameo and Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lecter also co-stars. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a good movie, but don't expect it to remain true to the book. Apparently there are plans to film THE BOURNE SUPREMACY with Damon. I hope that one turns out a little better. And I hope Damon has developed some kind of acting range by them. His Jason Bourne seems to have been "Bourne" prematurely. Not that Richard Chamberlain was much better in the role. It's still worth watching though. Don't let my quibbling put you off.</p></body></html>

Score by Danny Elfman.<br /><br /> Starring Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman as the whiny cowardly Jew.<br /><br /> After an Al Quaeda attack on the American section in Saudi Arabia leaves over a hundred dead, a team of FBI agents manage to gain entrance to the Kingdom for five days to try and solve the case in spite of general Islamic obstruction and intolerance. Though aided by a sympathetic Saudi Police officer, they do not actually solve the case but rather the case resolves itself when the terrorists attack again allowing the agents to shoot them all dead in as confusing gunfight.<br /><br /> While not the typical anti-American/proterrrorist liberal propaganda fare coming from Tehran West, the film shows that even when they try and not do the above, Hollywood simply has no idea how since its morals and knowledge of the subject is so puerile and deranged that it is simply beyond them. The film does have Muslim Terrorists murdering innocent people but it is far more concerned with showing the single muppet like Muslim police officer be all cute and cuddly as he tells us how he grew up watching Bill Bixby in The Incredible Hulk. The film's dialogue and tone is atrocious adapting a sort of hip Not Ready for Saturday Night Live characterizations for the four FBI agents completely trivializing the recent mass murder of their fellow citizens. The dialogue such as it is consists of people talking unintelligibly over one another, cursing and making empty catch phrases. Easily 90 percent of the dialogue could be cut with no loss to the plot. There is no reason for Jennifer Garner to be in the picture. Her part could have been played by anyone. Her part could have been cut. The usually good Cooper is awful. Because the film does show some Muslim's behaving badly, to provide "balance", we get subjected to Bateman's APPALLING and increasingly regular Hollywood stock figure of the whiny cowardly Jew thus indicating that the West Coast seems to think that there is money to be made in anti-Semitism.<br /><br /> The film is so concerned with being innocuous and non-threatening(except for the Jews) that about 30 minutes in it begins to distance itself further and further from the film's basic plot--to wit Muslim barbarians killing people and the race to stop them. The film seems to want to be anywhere else than where it should be. Thus we get pointless scenes of Bush Administration officials----though portrayed acting like Clinton Administration officials. We get endless scenes of the cute FBI agents engaging in mindless banter. They never actually solve the case and instead we get shots designed to show us that Muslims love their children too. Which is not the problem. Rather it is that they hate everyone else's children and want to kill them. The film never even attempts to address what should be the film's main issue. Just why are these Muslims racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, xenophobic mass murdering barbarians and what should we do about it??<br /><br /> The film does not know and does not want to know. It's message seems to be that Americans should just stay home and never leave the country.<br /><br /> AND in the last scene, presumably to assure good reviews, the film compares Al Queada with the FBI indicating that they are morally equivalent. And as was once noted in regards to the Cold War. Those who claim moral equivalence between the forces of freedom and good and the forces of oppression and barbarism actually mean nothing of the kind and are on the side of the later.<br /><br /> The film is badly directed with action scenes so incomprehensible that the DVD comes with a feature allowing the viewer to figure out what was going on.<br /><br /> In spite of the repugnant final scene, the film is not terrible but it is not especially good. If one cannot tell the difference between good and evil then one cannot make a film about the difference between good and evil............and if one tends to be sympathetic to the later........................<br /><br /> Boring more than anything else.<br /><br /> A wasted opportunity...probably by design.</p></body></html>

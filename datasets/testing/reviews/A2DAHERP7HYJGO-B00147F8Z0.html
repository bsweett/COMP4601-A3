<meta name="summary" content="CAN HOLLYWOOD MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE?"></head><body><p>In 2004, Fox Studios took two hot properties and blended them into a single motion picture. Granted, it had already been done by Dark Horse comics, but this was the first time it made it to film. AVP: ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR was a hit at the box office but not so among fans and critics alike. When word leaked out that another film with the two extra terrestrial combatants came out, it was met with hope that it wouldn't be the same. In some ways it was and others it wasn't.<br /><br />The film opens with a spaceship commanded by one of the Predators, a race that lives to hunt, careening through space filled with jars containing infant aliens, those shiny black shelled creatures with extending dentures. The spaceship crashes on Earth, letting lose the aliens to breed and the Predator to pursue them.<br /><br />The aliens quickly attack a hunter and his youngster son, mutating into the normal ugly acid blooded creatures we've known to love. But the Predator, with his gadgets and weapons, is hot on their trail. Unfortunately, there are more of them than him.<br /><br />We are offered several other characters that will eventually become fodder for the creatures that are far faster and more adaptable. A returning war hero and her daughter, a troubled man returning home after a prison stint, his brother and the girl he has the hots for, a police chief, etc. Don't worry if you don't get the background stories on each. For the most part, it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />What does matter, or at least should have, are the skirmishes between the two main creatures in the title. There are a few fights between them that rock and roll, but the biggest problem seen is the unseen. Most of the fights take place at night and in near total darkness. I could be wrong but I felt like I saw more of the aliens in the first two movies than I did in total here.<br /><br />And the Predator? It fluctuates between being a good guy protecting people and a hunter that cares little about anything that gets in his way. The fact that he is shot at by humans that have no clue what he is other than a big ole ugly alien don't help him in deciding that the only side to stand on is his own.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are several scenes in the film that are a fan boy's dream. Face to face creatures, one spewing acid like blood, projecting its metal like fangs as it tries to penetrate the defenses of the other warrior bred predator, were what fans were waiting for all along. But again, little light is shed to get a decent glimpse of either one.<br /><br />The long lost love stories, the instantaneous interests between characters, the decisions made on how to survive are supplemental at best. The acting among these characters is well done but none stands out above the rest. And the final solution to the film, a military one that sounds feasible, leaves a tiny opening for another sequel.<br /><br />My guess is that this won't be happening though. The movie did well at the box office, but word has already leaked that Sigourney Weaver was in talks to do another film in the ALIEN series which was squashed with the results from this one. Who knows, perhaps someday one of those fan boys who loves both movies will find a way to make the film that the whole world has been waiting for. We can only hope.</p></body></html>

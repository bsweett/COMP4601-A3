<meta name="summary" content="2 Superb Movies for the price of one"></head><body><p>You could say that 'Full Metal Jacket' is a movie which in fact consists of two movies that can be seen seperate, though we can see some of the characters back in part II.<br /><br />Part I is about boot-camp where new marines are taught to be killing machines by a magnificent Lee Ermey. There are so many insults and so much degrading that there aren't really any personalities. There are just soldiers with their own quirks but we never get to know anything about them.<br /><br />Part II is your typical war movie with of course a Kubrick twist. Visual signs are everywhere. The main character, Private Joker, starts out in the bootcamp but in Vietnam is a reporter wearing a peace-sign, while on his helmet we can read "Born to Kill". There are many signs like this, which makes the movie really interesting to look at.<br /><br />The movie is an anti-war movie and shows the contempt soldiers have in war for the enemy. There is a scene of someone randomly shotting people from a helicopter, a mass grave and more.<br /><br />Better than Platoon, almost as good as Apocalypse Now.</p></body></html>

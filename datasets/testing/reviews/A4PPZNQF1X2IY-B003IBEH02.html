<meta name="summary" content="Could have been excellent movie, but too scattered and long"></head><body><p>This movie has great content, but it seems like they forgot to hire an editor.<br />One moment you're creeped out, the next moment you're supposed to be filled with awe and wonder at a heavenly sequence, it just is too scattered and ambitious.  It's a shame because the casting is great and the story does have the potential to be powerful in more skilled hands.  Several parts were too contrived, worst of all the relationship with her "boyfriend", which they inserted like a letter into a mail slot, no chemistry or feeling.  Tucci was great and I'd still recommend the movie.</p></body></html>

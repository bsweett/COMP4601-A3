I'm not familiar with the Aeon Flux cartoon series, but after watching some clips from the Special Features of the DVD, I actually prefer the movie.  The cartoon Aeon has spazzy hair, is scantily clad in some strange male-fantasy sort of way, and I was a little disturbed by the scene of a man sticking his wiggling tongue into a woman's ear.  Borderline pornographic if you ask me.<br /><br />The movie version took some license, softened the hues, made the Bregna world stylish and organic.  I admit the plot is a bit oversimplified and the characters dramatically flat, but the physical action is a pleasure to watch. Charlize made for a gracefully efficient and lethal Aeon Flux.  She maimed her victims with elegance.  Somewhat contradictory in terms, but the action was very fluid and feminine.  I do like that director Karyn Kurasama chose to make a sci-fi futureworld that was very beautiful versus the traditional industrial, hardcore, burnt out look. Think of this movie as the softer version of the Matrix in haute couture.</p></body></html>

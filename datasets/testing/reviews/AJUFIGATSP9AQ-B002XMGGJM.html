<meta name="summary" content="Rage of the Monster"></head><body><p>Monster on the Loose with Vengeance!... for the Saw Era. Rage is the way it starts and then procedure, then rage, procedure...and so on. Revenge film poses better than its sleazy heart. It's like "Jason" in court and fighting the system with a "Jigsaw" presentation. It's like Death Wish Science Fiction Fantasy played out as real. Blue-ray is muted but looking the high G it is. Sound isn't showy, but is crystal clear even when booming and zapping with interest.<br />It's a lot of fun. You will be inrtigued. perhaps shocked or bored; depending on taste.</p></body></html>

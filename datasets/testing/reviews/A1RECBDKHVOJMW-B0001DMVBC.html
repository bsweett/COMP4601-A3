<meta name="summary" content="A Dark Tale Of The American Dream Turned Nightmare"></head><body><p>Vadim Perelman, in his directorial debut, has created an extraordinarily powerful drama with &quot;The House Of Sand And Fog.&quot; Award-winning actors Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley give truly great performances in this dark and tragic film of the American Dream turned nightmare. Shohreh Aghdashloo, as Kingelsy's wife Nadi, and Jonathan Ahdout as his teenage son Esmail, are also superb. And cinematographer Roger Deakins stunning photography sets the mood throughout the film.<br /><br />Persian immigrant, Massoud Amir Behrani, (Ben Kingsley), is a former colonel in the late, deposed Iranian Shah's air force. He is an intelligent, well educated man, who used to be respected in his native country as a person of position, power, and means. Behrani's former life, with all his efforts to build it, seems like it was constructed on a sea of shifting sand. He came to America with his wife, son, and daughter with limited funds, and has spent almost all of his money setting his family up in the manner to which they had been accustomed. One of the primary reasons for doing this was to marry his daughter to a member of their former social class. He is now reduced to working as a common laborer by day and a convenience store manager by night in order to provide for his family. His co-workers are men he would have given alms to in his native land. Angry and humiliated at how far he has fallen, Behrani decides to invest his remaining funds in a house that has been put up for auction at a Sheriff's Sale, because the owner had not paid property taxes. He wants to make improvements on the house and sell it at a large profit, which he hopes will enable him to provide his family with their former lifestyle, and restore some of his lost dignity. <p>Kathy Niccolo is a disaster waiting to happen. She is a depressed, quietly self-destructive, recovering alcoholic and addict. Her house, in the California hills overlooking the Pacific, was bequeathed to her and her brother by her beloved father. It is all she has. She is adamant in her refusal to give-up her home because of a bureaucratic error. She was evicted for failing to pay a tax she never should have been charged in the first place. However, with her usual carelessness, she ignored a number of correspondences and warnings from the local tax board. <p>Sheriff Lester Burdon, (Ron Eldard), delivers the eviction papers to Kathy. She confides in him and he becomes obsessed with helping her fight for justice. Lester finds himself falling in love with Kathy, although he is married with two children and much personal baggage of his own. <p>The contested ownership of the house is the fulcrum of the intense plot. Two people compete with increasing desperation, for the title to one small bungalow, which has a different meaning for each of them. The tragedy lies in their inability to communicate and understand one another. Part of the movie's incredible power is the difficulty one has in deciding which party to side with, as both are at once sympathetic and worthy of censure. <p>The film is absolutely riveting and the tension builds to a surprising climax. To say that &quot;The House of Sand and Fog&quot; is not upbeat entertainment is a major understatement. So, although I give the movie my highest recommendation, I do so with reservations. Prospective viewers should be cautioned that the grim intensity of this piece will stay with you for a very long time. Definitely not a films to see twice.<br />JANA</p></body></html>

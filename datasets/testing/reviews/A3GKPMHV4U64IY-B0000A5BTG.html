<meta name="summary" content="The Novelization is Better"></head><body><p>Watches stop.  People with pacemakers drop dead.  Thousands of pigeons (and one fish) fly into things at Trafalgar Square.  All these things are symptoms of a greater problem.<p>One scientist consulted on one of these problems does a little data compilation and reaches a terrifying conclusion:  There is something wrong with the planet and we are all going to die.  He asks for help from a more public scientist (a back-stabbing plagiarist) and his fears are confirmed.  But military minds do not like defeat without a fight so they put every conceivable resource to bear on the problem.<p>We wind up with an expedition to the core of the planet for the purpose of setting off a pile of nukes in hope of getting the core to spin properly again.  Time is on the essence but gives way to billions of dollars and the expedition sets off.<p>We are then treated to some serious assaults on science as we find a geode the size of the Superdome, diamonds the size of Cape Cod (theorized to exist in planets the size of Jupiter), and a ship without power that somehow races to the surface.<p>The novelization was better as it did not suffer from the harsh editing.  For example, the film skips over the crucial problem that the instructions fro the nukes are in French and their Frenchman is dead.  The supposed change of heart in the plagiarist does not work when he says, "Yes, this ship is yours, but I wish it could have been ours."  It comes off as if he wanted credit for yet another discovery of someone else's.<p>All in all the movie is sort of like Armageddon with it's absurd science, but not quite as fun (space scenes a cooler than a shot of an uninteresting ship surrounded by red-orange whatever).  Still, I am sure there are many who will enjoy this one and it is quite superior to Deepcore (the movie Terry Farrell left Deep Space Nine for).</p></body></html>

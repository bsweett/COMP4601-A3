<meta name="summary" content="They rarely make 'em like this"></head><body><p>This movie has got just about everything.  Borderline classic.  Jack is an obsessive compulsive guy who tries to overcome so many of his "hang-up" for the sake of a relationship with Helen Hunt.  She realizes this is "As good as it gets", and has to make a choice.  So very many subplots, and contemporary statements made in this movie.  Not only does it make you laugh, but think and feel about your own foibles, and your own views on various topics.  Its very good!</p></body></html>

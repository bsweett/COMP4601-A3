<meta name="summary" content="DeNiro and Fanning light up the screen..."></head><body><p>Robert De Niro (Heat, Taxi Driver) and rising child actor Dakota Fanning (I Am Sam, War Of The Worlds) star in this suspenseful new thriller directed by John Polson (Swimfan).<br /><br />Hide and Seek is about a man, David, and his daughter, Emily,  who have to cope with the sudden death of the mother and move out to a small town in upstate New York to help the stricken young girl heal. What happens next is Emily begins communing with an imaginary friend named Charlie that her father fails to see eye to eye but senses his existence after strange occurences begin happening around the house, including murder.<br /><br />Hide and Seek succeeds in gluing the viewers eyes to the screen and making him ask the usual question of "Who's doing it?"<br /><br />Although I figured out who done it about half way through the movie (because I'm psychic...just kidding!), due to some common horror movie cliches, the movie's stars De Niro and Fanning light up the screen with their excellent performances.<br /><br />A recommended viewing<br /><br />B-</p></body></html>

This  leads to a public outcry for Mutant Registration and a covert operation by special forces that has been approved by the president against the school for the gifted.  The attack leads to a joint operation between both sides of the mutants, since a dark future seems to lie ahead if the problem is not solved.  As in the predecessor, this film has several subplots that are built up around the general storyline that offers something for all viewers, which generates a terrific cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

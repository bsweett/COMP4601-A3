<meta name="summary" content="Detective story writers against cops"></head><body><p>A simple situation in cop country, L.A. California. An oldtimer did something irregular to prove the guilt of a criminal who otherwise would have gone through unscathed. His younger partner is put under pressure by some investigation in the service and he is going to yield, i.e. speak. In a difficult investigation in Alaska the senior cop is confronted with the possible accident of shooting at some outline that could be the criminal or any other cop on the ground, because of the poor visibility due to fog. He shoots, and it is his partner. The criminal witnessed this event and, as a detective story writer, manipulates the cop into some impossible situation that is aiming at making someone else be found and proved guilty. Unluckily things are moving slightly differently. And the result will be a whole slate of dead bodies. There definitely is some suspense in all that. We are constantly wondering what the criminal or the cop are going to do to trap each other and we are in for quite a few surprises. Good entertainment even if it is not a masterpiece. No psychological depth, no social dimension, no symbolical power, just a cat and a mouse playing together and we of course never know who the cat is, not to speak of the mouse. A perfect situation for a third little animal to come into the picture and play his own game.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

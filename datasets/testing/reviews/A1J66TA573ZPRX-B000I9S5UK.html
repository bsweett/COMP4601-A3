<meta name="summary" content="Great action movie and a funny movie"></head><body><p>Dont read if you havent seen the movie.  Great action, comedy, and a great movie.  Lots of action and lots of comedy.  I was surprised that it was funny because the trailer doesnt make it look like a comedy its an action movie but its funny.  The only thing I did not like about it was the fact that almost everyone dies in the movie.  Other than that it was a good movie.  Also Drea de Matteo and  Maria Bello are hot.</p></body></html>

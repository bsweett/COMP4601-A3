<meta name="summary" content="What an intense two hours!"></head><body><p>This was an extremely difficult film to watch.  It starts off Kafkaesque, and even from the beginning it is very hard, if not impossible, to know what is fantasy and what is real.<br /><br />Oh Dae-su has been inmprisoned for 15 years and he has no idea why, or who has done this to him.  Upon his release, he finds a young woman, Mi-do, who is extemely attentive to him.  The rest of the movie centers around these two people and uncovering the secrets which led them to each other, and in identifying and dealing with his nemesis.<br /><br />In particular, the relationip betweeen the young woman, Mi-do, and the protagonist, Oh Dae-su, does not appear credible, but this and other happenings which appear to be unexplainable come together at the end.<br /><br />The musical score is beautiful, and forms a counter-point of sorts with the violence of the film.<br /><br />There is a lot of violence, and some of it is so extreme that I did not know if the violence was meant to be real, or was it a fantasy, a dream in the mind of Oh Dae-su.<br /><br />While the ending ties most of the movie together, you have to have a strong stomach to get there.<br /><br />This has to be one of the strangest films that I have recently seen, and although I finally came away with a sense of satisfaction with it, it is too intense, too difficult a film for me to recommend to anyone I know.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NOT A CLASSIC BUT STILL VERY GOOD."></head><body><p>Some Romero purists no doubt find it a sacriledge that a remake of his classic zombie film was even made.  Yes...the original stands not only as the greatest zombie movie ever made, but also a bonafide horror classic.<br /><br />That said, director Zack Snyder's remake, or re-imagining if you will, has a LOT going for it.  First of all it has a much bigger budget and as a result has better special effects, better production values, and superior acting.<br /><br />Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mekhi Phifer are all names and faces that the audience is familiar with.  And look for TVs Max Headroom (Matt Frewer) in a bit part.<br /><br />The Story begins with Nurse Ana (Polley) sleeping comfortably with her hubby in a nice upscale suburb in wisconsin.  Suddenly her husband is attacked by the little neighbor girl and has his throat bitten out.  within seconds he rises from the dead and attacks Ana.  She narrowily escapes in her car and finds the city on fire and people running about madly.<br /><br />Soon she meets up with cop Kenneth (Rhames) and then Micheal (weber), Andre (Phifer) and Andres pregnant girlfriend Luda.  They decide to break into a large shopping mall where they encounter three mall security guards led by the aggressive CJ (Michael Kelly) who have claimed the mall as their own.<br /><br />Later they are joined by another group of survivors as they make the mall their own and later try to flee by boat to what they hope will be small islands uninhabited by zombies.<br /><br />Snyder has taken a page out of "28 Days Later" and instead of making his zombies slow and shuffling like Romero, has made them move at full speed and hell on wheels.<br /><br />This does certainly make the zombies much more dangerous since they are stronger and faster and more difficult to get away from.  You're just not going to run out into a crowd and dodge them or keep them at bay with a torch.<br /><br />On the other hand making them faster makes them less scary in a way.  Because they move so fast you never really get the kind of up close looks at them the way you did in the original.  That's a shame because the FX teams did a great job with the makeup, but you often just catch glimpses of the zombies.<br /><br />One thing this Dawn had that the first didn't was the tough female lead in Polley.  Also standing out was Michael Kelly as the head mall security guard who is a gung-ho rent-a-cop but shines as the courageous leader at the end.<br /><br />While this unrated version packs in some of the gore left out of the theatrical version, it still is not as raw and visceral as the original.  While we have many bites on victims, we don't have the dismemberment, and entrails being torn out and eaten as we did in the original.  Although there were a lot of very well-done effects of zombie heads being blown off and later documented in one of the featuretts.<br /><br />The remake doesn't quite have the undertone of black comedy and social commentary of the original but does have it's share of funny moments such as when gun store owner Andy is sniping at zombie celebrity look-alikes like Jay Leno and Burt Reynolds, as well as a funny part with the security guards taking a quiz out of Cosmopolitan magazine.<br /><br />In all, This Dawn is a welcome addition to Zombie Lore.  Better I think than 28 Days Later and leagues ahead of many low-budget movies, but still not a classic like the original.<br /><br />Great DVD extras cover special effects, makeup, deleted scenesm Andy's secret tape, and more.<br /><br />Well done!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Gritty, Underworld Masterpiece."></head><body><p>&quot;Scarface&quot; is one of the greatest of all mob movies. It's an epic crime drama done with style and care. Brian DePalma presents a film that ignites the screen with a great screenplay by Oliver Stone and an  amazing performance by Al Pacino. Unlike &quot;The Godfather,&quot; which  was more about family and relationships between father and son,  &quot;Scarface&quot; is an exhilarating and intriguing journey into Miami's  mob underworld, seen through the eyes of Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee with  some of the greatest lines in movie history. The degree of excess here is  brilliantly done and adds even more realism to a great work. DePalma shows  a wonderful touch of style in the sets, costumes, cars, even in the  violence. Look at the brilliant eye for composition he shows in a scene  where an assassination attempt is carried out on Tony in a nigh club. The  movie is full of that Latin style and intensity. The screeenplay By Oliver  Stone is brilliant because it's complex in the way in which we are not just  interested in the action, but characters and events as well. We really care  about what happens with these people, least of all Tony. Pacino gives one  of the greatest and most intense performances, always believable. He steals  the show entirely through his accent and facial expressions. The action  sequences aren't dim-witted, but smart and stylish. &quot;Scarface&quot;  vibrates with style and realism like few gangster dramas have. It stands as  a masterpiece. One of the greatest crime pictures of all time.</p></body></html>

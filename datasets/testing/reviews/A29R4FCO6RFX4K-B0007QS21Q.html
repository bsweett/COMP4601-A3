<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith's best movie"></head><body><p>Making a return to form after the disappointing sequels MIB 2 and Bad Boys 2, Will Smith gives his best performance to date in Alex Proyas' I, ROBOT. Like a cross between Metropolis and A.I, the story carries the action, rather than depending on special effects and stunts. Sure, the `robots created by man go bezerk and turn on their masters' premise is hardly original, but thankfully by process of eliminating the predictable clich&eacute;s, the film manages to outshine previous cinematic future-world robotic chaos dramas. Marco Baltrami's techno-schizoid musical score shifts the film out of first gear, and William Hoy's slick editing tempers the film's fast-paced action scenes. Simon Duggan's stunning cinematography veils the film in an eternal dark city-slick that is both easy on the retinas and appears gloomy at times. And despite some action scenes feeling a little too reminiscent of previous Sci Fi efforts, I, Robot still has some fantastically contrived frenetics.<br /><br />But it's not all about action. Smith (As detective Del Spooner) delivers a performance that, while not Oscar worthy, still manages to rise above expectations. Especially considering how ill suited he is for the role. And Bridget Moynahan adds much to her admittedly secondary role. One of Isaac Asimov's most intriguing SF tales, the adaptation has been handled well, inserting scenes and characters that give more meat to the story without losing sight of the original message.<br /><br />There are flaws: Some exposition scenes run long and become tedious, and while there is solid action throughout the film's lengthy running time, the finale feels somewhat overcooked. However all this is small beans, because it's not about the action quota, instead focusing on a more personal level. Rising above the sub-genre's restrictions while simultaneously providing a cerebral mystery movie, this has everything that a SF fan could want. One of 2004's most satisfying films, I, Robot does more than linger in the memory for a while, it asks some very important questions about the frailty of humanity and queries the strength of our very existence. The DVD has plenty of extras to satisfy the most ardent of aficionados, including behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, trailers and more. This is a highly recommended addition to anyone's DVD collection.</p></body></html>

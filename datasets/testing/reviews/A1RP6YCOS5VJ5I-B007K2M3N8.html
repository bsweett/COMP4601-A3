It goes against traditional films and skips right through scenes to get to the next. For example, Darin at his home but when he walks out the door he is automatically at the film studio. It may sound confusing but it really works on screen and skips all of the driving scenes and it is at times funny. Which is the intention at some parts of the movie. I also like how they turned this biography into almost a musical. Having dance numbers and songs that tell stories, this movie really does go against the grain and works! I really do recommend this movie just to see how something different can be done and see the story of a really great performer and singer. Even if you aren't a fan and don't know who he is, it is still worth seeing. Really well made!</p></body></html>

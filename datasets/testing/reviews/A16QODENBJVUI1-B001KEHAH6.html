<meta name="summary" content="A delightful light comedy"></head><body><p>Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit famously quipped, "Dying is easy; comedy is hard."  Jennifer Garner has enjoyed phenomenal success starring as Sydney Bristow is the superb action series ALIAS, but comedy acting is much more difficult than performing an action role.  The question with this film was whether Ms. Garner was going to be able to make the transition to comedy.  The verdict?  Quite well.  I don't want her to quit ALIAS, but I hope she takes another stab at comedy at some future point in her career.<br /><br />The movie is basically BIG meets A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  A thirteen-old-girl, who like all teens yearns desperately for a host of things that seem important at the time.  After a particularly humiliating birthday party, she yearns to be thirty, and she gets her wish.  Jennifer Garner does a fine job of playing a thirteen-year-old girl trapped in a thirty-year-old's body.  She suffers by comparison with the extraordinary performance by Tom Hanks in BIG, but who wouldn't (I'm not aware of any comic actor ever who would have been more delightful in that role than Hanks).  But as the film goes along, it transforms from a female version of BIG to A CHRISTMAS CAROL, with Garner's character Jenna learning what a terrible person she has become, cut off from her parents, without having talked to her male best friend in seventeen years, ruthlessly stealing ideas from other people in her job, cheating on her boyfriend, sharing company secrets with another company, and just generally living a pretty rotten life.  Of course, we all know from the first seconds of the film that Jenna will get to go back and do her life over, getting it right this time.<br /><br />There are a few scenes that are a bit too precious that I think could have been dispensed with, such as thirty-year-old Jenna giggling with a bunch of young teenaged girls, telling them about her kissing a guy.  But there were also a lot of fun scenes, and if as a whole it stretches credulity, this can be forgiven because the movie never pretends to be anything other than a fun time.  I especially enjoyed some of the scenes were grown up Jenna gets incredibly embarrassed by grown up behavior, such as when her self-absorbed hockey-playing boyfriend does a strip tease for her.<br /><br />I enjoyed Mark Ruffalo as Jenna's thirteen-year-old male friend all grown up, and it was fun to see Andy Serkis in a role without CGI masking him (he memorably played Gollum in THE LORD OF THE RINGS) playing Jenna's boss.  The cast was not an especially strong one, but it was up to the task at hand.  The two main performers-Garner and Ruffalo-acquitted themselves well, and the teenaged actors playing them were convincing as younger versions.<br /><br />This is not one of the great films ever made, but it is a very pleasant one.  I recommend it for an evening when you want to kick back, turn off your brain, and pass a pleasant couple of hours.</p></body></html>

It is just too difficult to take seriously any message - no matter how important it may be - when you cannot stop guffawing at the messenger.<br /><br />Paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is frustrated that his warnings of a global warming disaster are falling on deaf ears at a New Delhi conference.  However, it soon becomes clear that the danger is closer than anticipated when countries all over the world start experiencing unusual weather conditions.  As the northern United States freezes over, bands of survivors desperately head south to escape the deadly super-cooled air.  Jack, however, heads directly into the danger zone in order to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is trapped in New York.<br /><br />"The Day After Tomorrow" has that big-budget blockbuster feel with its impressive production values and visual effects.  However, while the film gets major brownie points for its "wrath-of-nature" scenes, it gets failing grades for its handling of its characters.  Virtually no time at all is devoted to character development and the situations they find themselves in are either preposterous or tiredly familiar.  Quaid, Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum, Arjay Smith, Dash Mihok, Sela Ward, Tamlyn Tomita, and Ian Holm all struggle to make something out of the wooden dialogue given to them but they never manage to breathe any life into their respective characters.  In all honesty, the snow in this film should have gotten top billing since it is by far the most interesting performer in this production.</p></body></html>

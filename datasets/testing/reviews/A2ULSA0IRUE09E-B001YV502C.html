<meta name="summary" content="An Exercise in Poor Film-Making"></head><body><p>This is at best, a good book turned into a very slow, tepid, and clueless film. We are supposed to care that people can't get pregnant anymore, and then one woman emerges pregnant, and the entire film focusses on getting her to safety so that she can deliver her baby.<br /><br />On paper, this is interesting, and yes, I have to give credit to the director for making a deep, hued film of a certain texture. However, you cannot get past the very weak casting, as well as the extremely useless ending. I never once cared for any of these characters, and am I really the only person who cannot for the life of me understand all of these five star reviews?<br /><br />"Children of Men" is a very poor 'futuristic' drama. This is a movie that is definitely overrated, and I am sorry I wasted time on it. Next time, I'd trust my own judgement rather than these 5 star reviews on Amazon.</p></body></html>

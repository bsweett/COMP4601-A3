<meta name="summary" content="Sounds Like 'Die Hard 3.5': Implausible, But Fairly Entertaining"></head><body><p>As the title suggests, 'Hostage' has two things -- hostage situation and Bruce Willis.  For most of film fans, that conbination means 'Die Hard' but as it turned out, his new film is not as good as that classic actioner.  Still, for all its too implausible story, 'Hostage' is full of (often violent) actions and suspence, hugely supported by a large amount of bullets flying over Willis's head.<br /><br />The film opens with a familiar pattern -- a failed police negotiator Bruce Willis moves into a small town with his family, where he becomes a cop.  Now, three young thieves sneak into a rich family's house to steal a car, but their plans go awfully bad when they are instead trapped in the house fortified with surveillance cameras, where they find many 'Benjamins' concealed in a safe.<br /><br />Things don't stop there, for another family (and that is Bruce Willis's character's for that matter) is also kidnapped, and he has to deal alone with the TWO cases at the same time, without letting the authority know the truths.  This superhuman task needs a help which comes from the inside of the house (of the first case), in the shape of a wise little boy, who escaped from the crinimals, and maintains the contact from the outside by a cellphone.<br /><br />Familiar?  Sure, it is familiar -- hostages, radio contact, etc. -- but all the elements that were seen in 'Die Hard' are used in a different way, to give more pumped-up effects.  The script of Doug Richardson ('Die Hard 2') provides enough actions to grab our attention, directed by French director Florent Emilio Siri, who clearly has good skills of composing reasonably exciting action sequences with good pace and editing.<br /><br />But the fact still remains that the story is too far-fetched, and at least they should have re-considered the casting of Rumer Willis (Bruce's real-life daughter) as, you know, kidnapped daughter of Willis's cop.  Quite frankly, she is doing the same thing as Sofia Coppola did to her father's 'Godfather III.'  The key roles should be given to actors strictly according to the acting ability.<br /><br />In spite of its unbelievable story and the obvious lack of good supports (Kevin Pollack remains unconscious through the considerable part of the film), 'Hostage' is still a reasonable action film made with taut, slick direction from Siri (whose 'The Nest' made in his native country is a real surprise), but it does not change the course of the fading star status of recent Bruce Willis.</p></body></html>

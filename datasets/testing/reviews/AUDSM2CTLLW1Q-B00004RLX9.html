It even is responsible for adding the word `trekker' (which, obviously, refers to fans of Star Trek) to the official English language, courtesy of the Oxford English Dictionary.  It is not hyperbole to say that "Star Trek" is a true cultural phenomenon that has reached into many corners of society.  The second full-length feature film "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" may be more responsible than any other production (television or film) for the series' widespread popularity.  To call it only a science-fiction movie would not do it justice.  After a dull predecessor that tried to hard to be like "2001" and appealed only to die-hard Trek fans, "...Wrath of Khan" reintroduced fans, new and old, to the great space opera that is Star Trek.  What enabled to transcend its genre and reach mainstream audiences was that it contained elements that spoke to most movie goers.  It is a tale of revenge in the same vein as "Moby Dick"; a tale of dealing with growing old and trying to recapture youth; it is part "Star Wars" and part "Run Silent, Run Deep"; and, most of all, it is a tale of supreme sacrifice.  All of those elements combined to make this the most successful "Star Trek" movie to date (both critically and at the box office) and enables the power of this film to resonate more than 20 years after it first premiered.<br /><br />After suffering the effects of a stiff story and sluggish fan reception for "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", producer Harve Bennett went back though all the old episodes of the original series to search for a storyline that would be most worthy of a sequel.  An episode called "Space Seed" which introduced audiences to the genetically enhanced super villain, Khan Noonian Singh, or more simply `KHAN!' (as Captain Kirk so eloquently put it in this film).  That choice produced one of the finest science fiction films to grace the silver screen.  In addition, the producers also did away with the clinical sets and pastel uniforms in favor of a cozier Enterprise bridge and uniforms more befitting a space navy.<br /><br />Khan (played with delicious melodrama by Ricardo Montalban) was a character that would have special reason to seek revenge against Captain (now Admiral) Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew of the Enterprise.  After defeated by Kirk at the end of the "Space Seed" episode, Khan and his cadre of genetic super humans were exiled to a planet that soon became an ecological wasteland, killing much of the crew (including Khan's wife).  Fast forward 15 years and Khan is presented with a golden opportunity to exact revenge when an ill-fated scientific mission by the USS Reliant stumbles upon his planet in an attempt to find a lifeless planet to test the Genesis Project, a new experiment that can produce life from lifelessness.  Khan manages to capture the investigative team (which happened to be the ship's Captain and its first officer, Chekov, from the original series) and use mind controlling parasites to take command of the Reliant.  Once in possession of his own starship and free from exile, Khan begins his quest to exact revenge upon Kirk while also seeking to possess the dangerous power of Genesis.<br /><br />"The Wrath of Khan" provides some of the most gripping moments of drama this genre has to offer.  The twists and crests in action are frequent, natural, and spectacular.  It's fascinating to watch the horror Kirk's face when he realizes that the man behind the surprise attack on the Enterprise is Khan.  When Kirk, and the damaged enterprise, abruptly turn the tables on Khan as he prepares to finish them off, a rush of adrenaline courses through the veins of all who are watching.  The cat and mouse battle in the Mutara Nebula reminds many of the submarine warfare from "Run Silent, Run Deep".  Then, there is the tragic sacrifice at the very end.  All of this made this film such a spectacular mainstream success in 1982 and continues to give it amazing strength today.<br /><br />The Special Edition Director's Cut restores a few scenes that have been absent from most of the past video versions, most notably two scenes that show what the connection is between Scotty and the young midshipman who dies during Khan's first attack.  In addition, the special features disc provides insightful interviews with cast members that shows the creative process and inspiration that brought "The Wrath of Khan" to existence.</p></body></html>

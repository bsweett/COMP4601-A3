And noir movies opened up with The Glass Key, The Postman Rings Twice, Key Largo, and Dark Passage.  The dark mood of these movies were put to best effect with black-and-white film, with dimly lighting in nighttime scenes reflecting the grimness of the genre.<p>Sam Spade becomes involved in the search for the title artifact with the introduction of three characters--Brigid O'Shaughnessy, Joel Cairo, and Kaspar Guttman.  All three are involved in one way or another with the title object.  The cynical Spade though, shows his loyalties to no one, but the one who pays him the most.  He is also quick to strike out at anyone menacing him, such as a pistol-wielding Joel Cairo or Wilmer, a hired gun.  His steel heart extends to his relationship with his partner, whose wife Iva he has an affair with, and even that is passionless.  Only Ebbie, his loyal secretary with a nice personality who can handle Spade, gets the less hard part of his hard edge.<p>However, two murders entangled themselves in the web.  The first is that of Spade's partner Miles Archer, who charmed by Brigid, offered to shadow a man she wanted followed.  The second is Thursby, the object of his hunt.  And Spade's caught up also because he is suspected of his partner's murder due to his affair with Iva, and he's got to fend off the police and D.A.'s office.<br />Certain camera shots get great mention, such as the shadow of the "Spade and Archer" sign cast from the window to the floor.  Another is the bright spotlight effect shown on Miles's surprised face as he gets shot.  And the way the camera focuses on the Fat Man's belly shows the weight he has, both physically and in terms of power.  The lights and shadows enhance the costumes as well.  Most of the characters are dressed in black.<p>This was the film that pushed Bogart to film legend status, making it his biggest success since The Petrified Forest.  Ahead of him lay greater roles such as Rick (Casablanca), Phil Marlowe (The Big Sleep), Allnutt (The African Queen), Queeg (The Caine Mutiny), and Linus Larrabee (Sabrina).  <p>Mary Astor (Brigitte) needed this kind of film, especially to counter the 1936 headliner scandal made over her sexual exploits with playwright George Kaufman, made public with the splashing of her diary across newspapers.  Sydney Greenstreet as the plummy but dangerous "Fat Man", i.e. Guttman, Peter Lorre as the slightly effeminate Cairo, and Ed Begley Jr. as the neurotic gunsel Wilmer all add to this classic.  He speaks in a low but quivering and menacing tone:  "Keep on riding me, they'll be picking iron out of your liver."<p>Cinematically, a classic, and remember that line, "the stuff that dreams are made of."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="United We Stand"></head><body><p>For weeks now we have heard the question asked, "are people ready to see a film about 9/11?" I laughed at the thought of the question. Of course people are ready. Did anyone ask that question during World War 2? Hollywood was turing out movies about the war left and right. Surely audiences members had loved ones fighting abroad. Did any one say, hey wait a minute, there's a war going on, people don't want to see a movie about a war. What about films such as "Since You Went Away" and "The Best Years of Our Lives", two of the greatest films made dealing with how the war effected the home front. Did people shout, "too soon!" Of course not.<br /><br /> "United 93" is one of the most intense, absorbing, touching, heartfelt movie going experiences I have had all year. No movie has touched me in such a profound way since "The Passion of the Christ". "United 93" is more than a movie. It transends comments such as "best film of the year". It is above that.<br /><br /> It should be pointless to go over plot description, so let me discuss my reaction to the film. First of all the movie makes no moral judgements. All the movie does, similar to a documentary, is show us what happened and allow us to come up with our own thoughts. We don't need to be told what happened on September 11th was bad. We don't need to be told the people who hijacked these planes were evil. So the movies doesn't feel any need to state the obvious.<br /><br /> But, "United 93" does raise some questions, only I'm not sure we are suppose to talk about them. I don't want to make "United 93" sound like a political film, it doesn't have a left or right point of view, but political questions will stir in your brain as you watch the movie. For instance, if the President could have been reached, what would have changed? Why couldn't the president be reached? Why did all branches involved not know what the other was doing? If every second was vital, what does the president's famous "seven minute" blackout tell us? Should he have done something?<br /><br /> The truly great movies make us ask questions. Not because they have plot-holes, but because we become so involved with the characters we don't want the film to end. We linger on and on about the characters and the events. "United 93" makes us ask a lot of questions.<br /><br /> Here's one more thing to think about. Remember when "The Passion of the Christ" came out, and groups were afraid it was going to cause anti-Semitism? I haven't heard a word from Muslim groups afraid this film would case race riots, have you? Why is that?<br /><br /> Ever since 9/11 happened people have claimed the "united 93" flight was American propaganda. I don't know enough about the issue to decided whether or not it is or isn't, but, lets assume it is. If it is all a fake, a story the government created to inspire patriotic feelings within us, than strickly as a work of fiction the film is still powerful and emotionally involving. But a bigger question lies underneath all this. Is it okay to talk about 9/11 and ask questions? Will this film push forward a debate?<br /><br /> "United 93" is a film everyone should see. Is it difficult to watch? Yes. I'm not going to lie to you. You may have the urge to look away, but don't. This is a gripping, emotionally draining experience that will linger in your mind long afterwards. It may even take a while for you to decided if it was good or not. But that's okay. See the movie, think it over, and most importantly, ask questions.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: The year's most emotionally draining, heartfelt, intense,and absorbing films I have seen since "The Passion of the Christ". I look at this work of art and feel it is more than a movie. It should be seen by everyone.</p></body></html>

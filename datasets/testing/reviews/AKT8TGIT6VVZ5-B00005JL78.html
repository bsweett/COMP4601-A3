<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's Splendid Cyberpunk Film"></head><body><p>Spielberg's second mature science film after "A. I.", "Minority Report", is not only a splendid homage to Philip Dick, the author of the short story "Minority Report", but may also be the best example so far of cyberpunk literature translated into film. Tom Cruise's character, police chief John Anderton, is a classic example of the loner, or drifter, found in many of William Gibson's early cyberpunk short stories and novels, especially the "Cyberpunk" trilogy depicting the dark, gritty world of the "Sprawl". Here, the screenwriters play tribute to Gibson in referring to Washington D. C.'s ghetto as the "Sprawl", and depicting computers and nanotechnology (e. g. the robot spiders) like those described vividly in Gibson's work and those of Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling.<p>Tom Cruise gives the finest performance in his career as John Anderton. It is matched with excellent performances by the young Irish actor Colin Farrell, British actress Samantha Morton, and the venerable Swedish actor Max von Sydow. The supporting cast, featuring the talents of Neal McDonough and Lois Smith among others, is excellent too. John Williams's score for "Minority Report" is as vividly intense as his for "A. I.", and is a far cry musically from those he composed for cinematic blockbusters such as "Jaws", "Jurassic Park" and the "Star Wars" saga.<p>I salute Spielberg for his excellent directing; his first foray into the realm of adult film noir, in the guise of a near future cyberpunk thriller. It is as thrilling a film as the first "Jurassic Park" movie or "Jaws", but easily transcends both with its adult depiction of crime and the meaning of individuality. Without question, this has to be considered as one of the finest films of 2002.</p></body></html>

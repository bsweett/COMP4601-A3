<meta name="summary" content="Who Doesn't Love It When Underdogs Come Out On Top?"></head><body><p>This is a great feel good musical with a real message. I couldn't quite picture John Travolta in fat padded drag until I actually saw it but he does a great job as Edna and even manages to capture a bit of the Baltimore accent.  All the parts are well cast and Seinfeld fans will enjoy seeing two of that shows "older" supporting players on screen again along with teen idols Zac Efron and Amanda Bynes as well as proven stars like Travolta, Christopher Walkon, Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah.  The music and dancing in the show are a lot of fun and the authentic period costume design is superior.  Lots of subtle visuals such as a woman scrubbing the famed white marble steps of her row house really set the tone of Baltimore in the early 60's.  But the film's good heart and  messages of tolerance,  acceptance and ultimate victory for the underdogs who believe in themselves and do what is right are what will make this musical an enduring classic.</p></body></html>

Some of Melvin's quirks include washing his hands and throwing away a whole bar of soap after one use (we see his medicine cabinet is packed with bars of soap), he can't step on cracks in the sidewalk or on any floors, uses his own utensils in a restaurant and has to sit in the same booth and order the same meal.  He is also the most insensitive, inconsiderate jerk you could ever meet.  He insults everyone he meets and uses stereotypical comments.  He has a crush on Carol (Helen Hunt), the only waitress in the restaurant that will put up with him.  Carol has problems of her own as her son is constantly sick due to the fact he is allergic to just about everything.  Melvin also has to &quot;put up&quot; with Simon (Greg Kinnear) his neighbor.  Simon is a gay artist and Melvin mercilessly rides him about his sexual orientation and despises his dog, who urinates all over the floor in the hallway.  Simon is beaten up badly and robbed by some thugs and Melvin is drawn into his life as Simon recuperates. Eventually, Melvin, Carol &amp; Simon take a trip from New York to Baltimore so Simon can visit his parents.  The movie gets a little sappy at the end, but the movie is so well acted, you can forgive director James L. Brooks for this.  Mr. Nicholson is at his curmudgeonly best.  He burns up the screen overtime he appears and gives the most comically performance of his career.  Ms. Hunt is both sweet and tough as she keeps pace most of the time with Mr. Nicholson.  Mr. Kinnear gives a breakout performance in his role.  Mr. Nicholson won his third Oscar for the role and Ms. Hunt took home her first.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This psychopath could give Hannibal Lector nightmares."></head><body><p>"Saw" is the suspense horror film to buy on DVD for this first quarter of 2005. After hearing mixed opinions about the movie, I felt that there was only one thing to do, ..see the movie for myself. I wasn't among those that were disappointed. Although the acting was a bit rusted (not by all), it was easily tolerable. The film had plenty of suspense, chills, and thrills around every unexpected twist and turn. Sure, there are those who knew what was going to happen next, but did they really? I found the idea of the movie fresh. I welcomed each intense moment. I'm not much on breaking things down in a movie review. I just recommend them or not. In this case I recommend "Saw" to those who like well paced horror. However, if movies like "The Grudge" scare you. Avoid this and save money on a therapy  bill.</p></body></html>

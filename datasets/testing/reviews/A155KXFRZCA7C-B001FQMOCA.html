<meta name="summary" content="Good Film about a miserable life with great music. More like 4 1/2 stars"></head><body><p>No doubt, that the acting performances by Phoenix and Reese are top-notch and really fabulous and for that aspect this movie is worth 5 stars. The life of Johnny Cash up to a certain time in the late 60s or so is well portrayed, although it's kind of depressing with Johnny's drug use, alcohol, infidelity and so forth. Overall it's an inspiring film, especially for aspiring singer/songwriters, because this film gives them hope that their music may reach a broader audience some day too. And the inspiration aspect alone is well worth watching this flick. The music is great too and as mentioned Phoenix just plays his part so very well and Reese as June Carter does also an excellent job without overplaying the role.<br /><br />The photography has also been executed very well especially regarding the set details for each particular era. It's just that there are a number of slow passages and as every movie should have a beginning, a middle and an end, the ending was rather abrupt and out of the blue so to speak without a lead-in and that bothered me a bit. But overall it's an inspiring movie and well worth watching it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3.5 Stars - Good Effects bolster a flagging drama"></head><body><p>Not wanting to address what personal issues Wolfgang Petersen has going on, with this, his latest venture in World destruction, one can't help drawing comparisons with his apparent penchant for portraying the end of mankind, in other movies like Godzilla, and Independence Day.<br />Dennis Quaid plays a paleoclimantologist (cross between a weather expert and a fossil expert I presume) who warns of the end of the World and is predictably ignored by the powers that be until his warnings begin to unfold in dramatic and horrific fashion. He is then summoned to offer his advice (albeit too late) to the President and try to set out a plan to save mankind. Despite the advances in believable CGI representations on screen recently, what plays out before your eyes is arguably amazing and gripping viewing and builds the tension nicely. Those expecting much more than has seen in the trailers may be disappointed, but the power of the visuals I feel lies more in the eerie tiny points of realism that paint much more of a complete picture than pure in your face graphics. Sadly from this point onward the storyline takes something of a nosedive on the credibility scale, and leaves you thinking EH? Mr. Quaid is continually battling with his conscience for not spending enough quality "Dad" time with his Son Sam (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and against his own advice to everyone else, sets off on foot to snow covered New York to save him. This is a valiant effort to portray intimate human drama amidst a morass of human annihilation, but the message gets lost and unlikely and ultimately leaves you not caring due to the implausible nature of it all. The story continues to center on a handful of characters trapped in New York but is disjointed as it tries to make you believe the importance of whether Sam should tell Laura he loves her whilst seconds before you have been told that entire continents are being obliterated, and most people in the Northern Hemisphere are likely to perish. This is NOT a bad movie, and will be undoubtedly be a big early summer hit at the box office for the main reason that the special effects are just about enough. The huge visuals successfully manage to carry the movie and make you endure a plot that is about as deep as a child's backyard swimming pool. The undertones and messages of human ignorance and perhaps timely warnings of global warming add some intelligence behind the eye candy, and make you sit up and pay attention throughout the 2 hours, which moves fairly quickly. It's just a shame that there are too many niggling and unanswered inconsistencies along the way to really pull off the story completely. 3.5 Stars at best.</p></body></html>

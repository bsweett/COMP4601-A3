This is basically how the film felt: 90% disgusting porn and dirty talk and 10% blood and gore action. The gore is fantastic along with the Lynyrd Skynyrd tracks, but the whole movie is about disgusting topics that I don't even don't want to go in to(It makes Hostel look like a Disney movie). Just avoid this movie people, it's not worth it.</p></body></html>

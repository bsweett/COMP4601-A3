<meta name="summary" content="Think twice"></head><body><p>A somewhat heavy-handed morality tale about the evils of arms trafficking and a not-so-subtle implication of the world largest suppliers (the U.S., China, France, and U.K.).  Nicholas Cage saves the film, however.  While I'm glad I didn't spent $18 to see this in the theater, it was worth the $3 rental.  Are you sure you want to pay $20 for this DVD?  Think twice about it.</p></body></html>

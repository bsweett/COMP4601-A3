<meta name="summary" content="Best Cops and Robbers Shootout Ever!"></head><body><p>Pacino and De Niro were perfectly cast for this movie. Jon Voight is the guy who gives De Niro and his crew "the scores." Pacino is the cop who tries to nail De Niro's kind before they can "take down scores."  Great acting, great plot. Bad Guys vs. Good Guys. Bad Guys vs Bad Guys......<br /><br />The bank robbery shootout was a masterpiece. For once a movie portrayed the "professional bad guys" as actually knowing how to shoot.  And boy, do they hand the cops their BEE-HINDS in their hats. They basically kicked cop-butt. Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore join De Niro with their assault rifles in the mayhem they lay out on the streets of L.A. This is the kind of movie that's get cops wailing and whining that they're out-gunned in the streets, when in reality, all you gotta' do is to practice shooting your weapon, and lay off the freakin' donuts.<br /><br />William Fitchner plays a double-crossing bad guy who gets his just desserts toward the end of the movie. The scene where his men try and double-cross DeNiro's crew in the abandoned drive-in was just another example of the difference between the pro's and the amateurs.<br /><br />The dialogue between Pacino and De Niro in the restaurant should have been an "Oscar" winner.</p></body></html>

Heather Graham releases a fine performance with her almost perfect accent.  Yet she's way too much of a knock out to be taken seriously as a late 1880' prostitute or &quot;wench&quot; while the other women looked filthy and harsh. Note how her Mary Kelly role is always the cleanest looking one of the bunch of...well, you know. What was fascinating was the alternate take on the Jack the Ripper murdering theory and who his true indentity was and the so-called diabolical motivation for doing what he did and to whom ! Also, the role the Royal British family patriarch figures into the whole plot. Wonder if the real Royal Family appreciated how their ancestral hierarchy was portrayed !<br />However, this film is not for the squeamish as there are several graphic violent blood and gore scenes. One scene in particualr is very disturbing since it depicts the Ripper doing what he does while another character holds the victim. The opium induced imagery adds to the already dark and dreary atmosphere for complete full effect...The ending is also, without giving it away, a complete surprise and shock.</p></body></html>

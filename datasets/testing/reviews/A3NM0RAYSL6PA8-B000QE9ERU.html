It felt more like the comics I read as a kid than any of the other Marvel outings of late, and had an array of villains who deserved the Punisher treatment.  The cast of characters in the movie range from bland to downright fun, the best of whom are three people who share the Punisher's tenement--to lovable losers and a gorgeous waitress with sensitive eyes.  John Travolta is decent as the lead villain, but sadly underperforms.<p>I must warn you that Punisher has some disturbingly violent events, including a man who has various piercings ripped from his face with a pair of pliers.  No, they don't show it!  But it's unsettling, obviously, as these are sadistic villains that go way beyond anything in the movies based on Spiderman, the X-Men, Batman, or Superman.  In addition, the Punisher himself becomes almost indistiguishable from the bad guys in his violence and sadism.<p>In the end, The Punisher is more of a ride than a movie.  I enjoyed it, but that's probably because I've become completely deadened to brutality and violence.</p></body></html>

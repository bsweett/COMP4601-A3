<meta name="summary" content="It's Just for Fun....Don't Take it Too Seriously"></head><body><p>I purchased Ocean's Thirteen because I enjoyed Eleven and Twelve. All techie details and between movie comparisons don't matter tremendously to me. I didn't watch it with a check list and detailed focus to make sure all the facts lined up perfectly. My review will be different on that level. I love a good story, snappy dialogue and fun characters. I want my movies to either entertain or make me think. Ocean's Thirteen is entertaining. Not perfect, but entertaining.<br /><br />Though less technically splendid than Twelve and the laser dance, Ocean's Thirteen still delivers. Neither of the females from Eleven and Twelve return but Ellen Barkin lends a feminine touch.<br /><br />The charm of the previous films still plays out. I love the camaraderie and bantering. The campy, quirky blending of outlaw "good guys" is still fun. I like the differing points of view, piecy film editing, the time twists and the final reveal of missing details.<br /><br /> Al Pacino is a nice addition to the cast and Terry Benedict's turn as a semi-good guy produces a few laughs.<br /><br />Thirteen may not be enjoyable unless you've watched the other two. If you have and liked them both I think Thirteen is a safe bet for you.</p></body></html>

Frankie (Eastwood) is an aging trainer who is afriad of moving on to the future and dwells on his past, which is really never told to the audience in the film.  All we know is that he and his daughter are not getting along, and each week he sends a letter only to have it returned to sender unopened.  Maggie (Swank) is the opposite, a young woman who also has a bad relationship with her family, but instead wants to move on from her past instead of trying to mend broken wounds.  She is poor, lives in a one room place, and is a waitress who pockets the leftovers for herself.  After Frankie's boxer moves onto another manager due to the fact that he felt that Frankie was holding him from a championship, Frankie feels lost.  His only friend is an aging boxer, Eddie (Freeman), who lost one eye because his manager left him and couldn't "protect" him.  Frankie feels that the number one rule in boxing is to "protect yourself", and Eddie feels that Frankie can't always protect his boxers from everything because he's protecting himself from a championship. While reluctant to train Maggie at first, he ends up taking her under her wing and she slowly becomes one heck of a fighter.  The relationship of these two build and build, and the audience really sees how they fit each other perfectly.  Maggie's father is dead, and her mother lives in a trailer ignoring her, Frankie has no family it seems (but the audience never  really knows) and her daughter never answers his letters.  The film is told through partial narrations from Morgan Freeman's character, who is really the only person who knows Frankie.  He lives in the gym that Frankie owns, and serves as the janitor.  The theme of boxing is used as a symbol for the punches that life throws at you, and that is why it is important to always "protect yourself".  This is not a boxing movie, but a film about the troubles of life that all of us can relate to.  The ending is very beautiful, very sad, very moving.  I am a huge film fanatic and usually see Oscar contenders before the ceremony, but I missed this one, in fact it was the only one I missed.  Now I wish I saw it before because it would have had my vote. The film is beautiful, just beautiful, probably the most moving film in the last 10 years. I don't remember a film where I was as touched as I was from Million Dollar Baby. Even when I watch the trailer now I get tears in my eyes.  If you haven't seen the film, I cannot stress enough the journey you are missing.<br /><br />ACTING: Hilary Swank deserves the Oscar, and so does Morgan Freeman. I thought DiCaprio gave the best performance of the year before I saw Clint Eastwood here, and he was definately more deserving than Jamie Foxx or DiCaprio.  The chemistry is perfect between all three of them. The sweetness of the relationship betwen Frankie and Maggie are so real and it never feels forced or unreal.  While Swank's character is 32 in the film, you'd swear she was a little girl, and that is what really sparks the father/daughter relationship the two share through these times in their lives even though they're not related.  Morgan Freeman, while a washed up boxer, is the wisest of the characters, always providing insight in every situation that is befitting.  The acting is top notch, and Clint Eastwood is magnificent.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Eastwood's production company is called Mal Paso, which translates from Italian as Bad Choice. This is a tribute to Sergio Leone because everyone in his life back then told him that doing those Spahgetti Westerns was a bad choice, and would ruin his career.  Well, I guess they weren't such a mal paso after all. Eastwood is more accomplished as a director than he is an actor, while he was America's (and Italy's) tough guy, here he shows his emotional side and his brilliant perspective on  drama, which is equivelent to life. Isn't It? I mean drama in films and books are meant to tell a story based on one's view on life, so drama is life.  Clint Eastwood sees this, and that's why his films touch close with everyone.</p></body></html>

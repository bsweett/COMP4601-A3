Action films are usually my least favorite genre. Who cares! This was one edge-of-your-seat,formulaic,tense and funny film for pure entertainment. I didn't think about the plot or character angst for one minute. I was entertained and had fun. What I did enjoy was the seamless editing and Michael Kamen soundtrack for this film.This film was shot in my neighborhoods of Baltimore and D.C. and it was great fun watching the two cities shot and pieced together to make Washington. For those wondering about Woodlawn in the film, it is a Baltimore suburb where the Social Security Administration is located. The only thing that goes on there is the highest murder- rated neighborhood in the city!The packed theatre where I saw this film howled when we saw that!!!</p></body></html>

This is unavoidable. The German-made biopic DOWNFALL is no exception. In this story of Adolf Hitler's last days, he's depicted as what he was: both a compassionate person and a deranged dictatorial monster. This attempt at honesty is admirable, and yet, the filmmakers exercise restraint, perhaps respect, in dealing with his and Eva's suicides. They're simply not shown, nor do we see their faces afterward.<br /><br />This same method is used when Goebbels and wife die in the courtyard: the camera discreetly cuts away. I'm not lusting for gore, but what would've been so wrong in actually witnessing the ignominious ends of two of the worst villians in history (Hitler and Goebbels)?<br /><br />By contrast, Frau Goebbels, who only hours earlier was anointed by der Fuhrer as "Germany's best mother," drugs her five children with a potion and once they're incapicitated she kills them by breaking cyanade capsules into their mouths. These horrific acts are shared with us in their entirety.<br /><br />It's troublesome. Lesser Nazis are seen blowing their brains out, so not showing Adolf or Josef doing so is a choice that sends a message, albeit not a loud one, to the viewer about the meaning of these figures to the German people, even in death.<br /><br />That's the only issue I take with what is an extraordinary and often nerve-shattering film, one that otherwise constantly rings true and is in fact a must-see for military history buffs.</p></body></html>

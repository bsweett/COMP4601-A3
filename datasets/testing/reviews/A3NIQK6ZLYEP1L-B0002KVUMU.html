<meta name="summary" content="Dracula just wants to be loved.."></head><body><p>Well, not really.  But at least the main idea, the main plot, was more realistic than Dracula just trying to take over the world, or England, for no reason.  Here, Dracula, played by the wonderful Richard Roxburgh, just wants to give his children LIFE.  That gave him a emotional touch, a shadow, a relic, from his human side that many other vampire characters in other movies have lost.<br /><br />Also, I enjoyed many of the scenes, I liked how they really brought out the beauty of Kate Beckinsale as well as the Brides -what nice outfits!  Thou I feel sorry for them - they had to wear almost nothing in very cold enviroments.<br /><br />Why only three stars?  Well, first off it was hard for me to see the character of Abraham Van Helsing as a homdsome, butt kicking, action hero.  A, as somebody else pointed out, James Bond for the Church.<br /><br />I liked the Mummy movies but I did't know much about the legends or myths behind the Mummy movies.  I DO happen to know a lot about vampire myth and fiction.  In other words, the very people who might wish to watch this movie, vampire lovers, might be the very ones who will spend the whole time shaking their heads and wondering what the heck they're watching.<br /><br />IF you watch it with the understanding that you will see werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, Mr Hyde and lots of vampires than you might enjoy it.  Don't compare it to ANY other movie - it is within a class by itself.  It is, after all, a Stephen Sommers movie.</p></body></html>

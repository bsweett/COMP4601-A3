<meta name="summary" content="An interesting, but almost complete failure"></head><body><p>Where to start?  There are so many things to dislike about this film, I hardly know how to start.  It's a bad film, but not like BLOODRAYNE II or BENCHWARMERS is a bad movie.  It's been made by committed, creative people who somehow missed actually stepping back and seeing that what they were making was silly, ludicrous and often quite boring.<br /><br />Why did I give it 2 stars?  Well, the one truly great thing about the film is that it reconvinced me that the music of The Beatles is a miracle...that it can stand the test of time in a way that no other "pop/rock" music can.  So that was good.  And I suppose it will turn a lot of the current teen generation on to the Beatles...I just hope they go out and listen to the real stuff.  Then they'll realize just how bad some of the renditions in ACROSS THE UNIVERSE are.<br /><br />Full disclosure time:  I'm a 44 year old man, who saw the movie with my 44 year old wife and 15 year old daughter.  The theatre was quite full (about 85%) and many, many teenagers were there...that was heartening.  My daughter liked it alot...my wife liked it okay.  All I could muster when it was over was "At least I stayed awake."  So I understand a lot of people won't agree with my assesment.<br /><br />The "story" follows a British "lad" named Jude, who in the early '60s leaves his Liverpool home to sneak into America to try to find the father who unknowingly left his mother pregnant when he was in Britain during WWII.  Jude meets up with Maxwell (Max) at Princeton.  Max is the unruly child of wealth and the two become fast friends.  Max drops out of school (naturally, since this is the Vietnam era, and being in college protected you from the draft...wouldn't YOU drop out of college just because it "wasn't for you.") and Max takes his new best buddy to Greenwich Village.  There they rent a room from Sadie, a Janis Joplin type.  Their crew is soon joined by Prudence, a lesbian from Ohio, Jo Jo (a Jimi Hendrix type) and most importantly, Lucy.  Lucy is Max's sister, who is coming to "spend the summer" with her brother, because she is grieving over the death of her boyfriend in Vietnam.  She gets over her grief awfully fast, because of course she falls for Jude...who returns the affections.<br /><br />The rest of the movie basically shows us the totally overworked, cliched view of the Village as America's heartland of music, drugs and Vietnam protest.  Every idea about the village that is presented has been done millions of times before.  The whole concept is not informed by real life, but by the filmmakers' remembrance of how the village always looked in other, far better movies.  You wonder if any of the people who made the movie had ever been to New York City.  Naturally, the all take psychedelic drugs and we get lots of scenes straight out of a '70s exploitation movie, with swirling reds and greens and images of bodies floating through mult-colored water smooching.<br /><br />Relationships struggle, the war protests grow more violent and the movie gets more and more laughable.<br /><br />But what of the music?  Well, early on, I had hope.  The film starts with our young Jude sitting on a lonely Liverpool beach, singing simply to the camera the opening lines of "Girl."  His voices aches, but he has a mischievous smile too.  I thought, "okay, this isn't bad...the song fits."  (Later, you come to realize that this young actor [in a BAD wig] can't really sing anything any other way...so you hear lots of slow aching renditions of songs that needed more texture.)  We also see a scene bouncing back and forth from UK to US of teenage kids dancing to cover bands performing "Hold Me Tight."  That was good.  But once we hear Jude achingly, slowly sing "All My Loving," it's pretty much over.  Soon after, we see Prudence, a cheerleader in Ohio, slooooowly singing "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" to the crush who will never return her love. When we first realized that she's singing about a fellow cheerleader and not the hunky football player, the audience burst out in laughter...not the good kind, either.  (Prudence would prove to be the worst character in the film..and the inspiration for a STUPID rendition of "Dear Prudence.")<br /><br />"With a Little Help From My Friends" was centered around an unimaginative night of partying with Max, Jude and Max's fellow rich, lazy Princeton classmates.  Much later, Max is inducted into the army, and "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" is used as a setting for a strange anti-war kinda thing in which all the soldiers wear creepy masks and the line "She's So Heavy" shows a group of recent inductees carrying a gigantic statue of liberty through a Vietnamish landscape.  Oh, and "I Want You" is sung by an animated Uncle Sam on an induction poster.  I found it all "heavy"-handed, recycled and vaguely offensive as an American.  Other "winners" include Jude's gutless "Revolution," Eddie Izzard's head-scratchingly weird take on "For The Benefit of Mr. Kite," and Sadie's Janis-Joplin take on "Helter Skelter."  The Beatles totally rocked that song, and yet somehow, Sadie's backup band is hardly heard in the film, and the song looses the insane nature of what Paul McCartney had meant to show that the Beatles could do a head-banging song (not that they called it head-banging in the '60s...but you know what I mean.)<br /><br />Were there NO good song renditions?  Okay, I admit some were okay.  "I've Seen A Face," set in a bowling alley, was actually fun, but it felt inspired by (or ripped-off) musicals like GREASE.  Bono singing "I Am The Walrus" reminded me how nice having a singer who actually knew how to sell a song is...even though much of the scene was generic psychedelic dribble.  Joe Cocker sang a decent "Come Together" although he didn't need any screen-time, with his heavily made-up face and cliched pimp clothes.<br /><br />Julie Taymor, the "creator" of this movie, is best known for her Broadway staging of THE LION KING.  She clearly has deep theatrical roots...but her sense of film is missing.  Many scenes feel like a theatrical staging, not a film staging.  And the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long...to much for such fluff.  Yes, it's fluff, even though it wants so badly to be taken seriously.  It feels way, way too much like everyone thought all the time..."oooh, aren't we clever, we worked in a joke about 'She Came In Through The Bathroom Window'?"  Also, the movie fails because almost every person in it is a terrible actor.  Even Evan Rachel Wood, the experience young actress who plays Lucy,is unlikeable.  She's a heartless brat most of the time.<br /><br />All that being said, I know others will respond to the movie totally differently.  So I'm not saying YOU shouldn't go...just that I wish I hadn't.  If you do go...I hope you enjoy it more.</p></body></html>

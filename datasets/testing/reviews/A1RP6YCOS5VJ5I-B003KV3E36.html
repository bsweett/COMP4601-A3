The story is surprisingly edge-of-your-seat storyline with great special effects with Stallone looking as great as the character as he ever has. Believe me, he is awesome! If you are a fan of the Rambo series, then there is no disappoinment to be found in this movie. It has some very detailed scenes that are almost so realistic it's scary. People watching this movie will stop and realize how good they have it in their lives after watching this movie. I wouldn't want to be put in anybody's shoes in those villages under attack. Great movie, definitely worth buying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE THING"></head><body><p>THE THING has to be one of John Carpenter's stand-out horror films, especially in terms of special effects. The plot is simple: A team of scientists in the Ant-artic are terrorized by a shape-shifting alien being from another world. The only problem is, who's the alien, and who's human? There's plenty of suspense, drama, thrills, and over-the-top gore. I recommend this to fans of both action, sci-fi, and horror films!</p></body></html>

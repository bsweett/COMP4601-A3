I am not by any means a QT fan. but I thought there wasn't that much gore, The Movie is A fun "What If" Scenario.It's worth renting to see for yourself. Although Valkyrie is a better movie. Would be nice to see the treatment in this movie given to Communists..With Stalin and all the Politburo in the same situation. Highly Doubtful,Hollywood would ever make such a film.</p></body></html>

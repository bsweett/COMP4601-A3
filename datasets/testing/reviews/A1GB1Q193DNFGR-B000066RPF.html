<meta name="summary" content="I Never Thought Looking For A Shrubbery Would Be This Fun!!"></head><body><p>In the early 1970's the Monty Python troop (Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, and Terry Jones) stars from the immensely popular television series Monty Python's Flying Circus began producing, with the help of a fundraising concert headlined by Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd (You lie!! No, I didn't!), initial photography on what would later become (from all my extensive years of movie watching) the single most unforgivably sidesplitting, enormously irreverent, shrewdly perceptive, unremittingly uproariously aggressive, gruesomely hysterical, and endlessly quotable comedies EVER. Not even Mel Brooks's Best Efforts (The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein) comes very close to the revolutionary medieval merriment sustained in this royal purebred of cult classics. BAR NONE. No contest here.<br /><br />Endlessly stockpiled with hauntingly hysterical sketches that will probably never leave your mind (no matter how hard you try) including, The Knights Who Say Nei, The Self-Abusing Monks (Eah aay ess eay dom eay nay), The Black Knight, The Trojan Rabbit, the Ever-Appearing Verbally Abusing French (I don't want to talk to you no more!!!), The Enchanter Named Tim, The Killer Bunny, The Bridge of Death (What is the capital of Hysteria?), The Old Woman Named Dennis, and so many countless more great sketches to include here that I'd die trying. Monty and Python and the Holy Grail remains an ever-enriching mirthful cult-classic that just seems to improve with age. Since Columbia has a bountifully hefty new special edition of the Holy Grail out now there should be no excuse, if you've never seen it (I think I'll go for a walk!!), just drop everything your doing (including Bringing Out Your Dead) and go experience this life changing movie today. You won't be disappointed, just tell them the Knight Not Appearing In This Film sent you, and they'll know what to do.<p>As for the options on the special edition here's a run-down:<p>Disc One: -&quot;21st Anniversary&quot; cut of the film running an extra 24 seconds;  -Anamorphic Widescreen; -Dolby 5.1 track; -Original Mono Track; -Audio commentary with Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin; -subtitles &quot;for people who don't like the film&quot; (you get the text from Shakespeare's Henry IV instead); -an &quot;on-screen screenplay&quot; feature which lets you read the screenplay as you watch the film; -&quot;Follow the Killer Rabbit&quot; feature; <p>Disc Two: &quot;Three Mindless Sing-Alongs&quot;; -&quot;The Quest for the Holy Grail  Locations&quot; featurette; -&quot;How to Use Your Coconuts&quot; educational film; -&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Japanese&quot; (with English subtitles); -the BBC Film Night special &quot;On Location with the Pythons; -an interactive cast directory; -still galleries with Terry Gilliam's original sketches and behind-the-scenes photos; -&quot;A Load Of Rubbish&quot; with mystery items; -unused ideas and other material; -two trailers<br />and web-links.<p>Both discs represent the absolute final word resource for EVERYTHING and I do mean everything you'd need to know about the Python's greatest film. An Absolute Necessity for any Python Fan!! <p>P.S. You can't base a system of government just because some watery tart threw a sword at you.</p></body></html>

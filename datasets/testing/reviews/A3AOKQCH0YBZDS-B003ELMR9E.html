<meta name="summary" content="Insomnia is a Good Suspense Movie"></head><body><p>"Insomnia" is a combination of cat and mouse suspense between the murderer in this movie played by Robin Williams & that of a seasoned, hot shot, LA detective played by Al Pacino AND whether or not Pacino's character is in fact a good cop or good cop made into a bad cop by the system.<br /><br />The acting and storyline are good, but not great in "Insomnia". Robin Williams isn't as convincing as the bad guy in this movie and the movie could have been a tad less predictable in the ending, but otherwise a good movie overall.</p></body></html>

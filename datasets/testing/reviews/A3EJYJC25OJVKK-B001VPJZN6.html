<meta name="summary" content="This Dragon has a lot of fire!"></head><body><p>I had relatively low expectations for the prequel to 1991&#65533;s &#65533;Silence Of The Lambs&#65533; but to my surprise, &#65533;Red Dragon&#65533; surpassed my expectations and in my opinion, a somewhat underrated and underappreciated movie. <p>The movie begins in a dark and suspenseful arena where Agent William Graham encounters the extremely evil and psychopathic serial killer Doctor Hannibal Lector. However, after witnessing the extremely disturbing scenes of grisly murders that took place in someones house though creates enormous emotional trauma in Graham that causes him to retire from the FBI but three years later, two families are slaughtered on the full moons and Graham comes out of retirement and goes into a hunt to stop the next murder of another family when the next full moon occurs in three weeks. However, the next target of the mysterious Tooth Fairy Killer is Graham&#65533;s own wife and son, and to the dismay of Graham, the only one who can be able to help him stop the horrific wrath Francis Dolarhyde aka Tooth Fairy Killer, is Dr Lector himself, the same man Graham stopped and put away years before. However, Dolarhyde is also being assisted by Dr. Lector in his murder spree and is the main villain known as the &#65533;Red Dragon&#65533;. Dolarhyde though is approached by an innocent woman whose blind (loss of eyesight) and falls in love with him, or so it seems. The psychopathic tendencies of the &#65533;Red Dragon&#65533; are driven by a painting that brings back memories of his childhood where he was horribly abused by his grandmother and the mental illnesses that resulted and he shows the remaining &#65533;human&#65533; that still exists. Sometimes in a way, it&#65533;s hard not to feel at least a bit sorry for him. <p>I have to say that this movie had a wonderful and incredible cast and couldn&#65533;t have been much better. Ralph Fiennes absolutely brings out the evil and extremely disturbed inner being of &#65533;The Red Dragon&#65533;. Anthony Hopkins wonderfully and cleverly portrays the disturbed mind of Dr. Hannibal Lector. Edward Norton was wonderful as William Graham. Quite frankly, this movie benefits from the excellent acting by all of the actors and actresses in the movie. <p>The movie has a ton of suspenseful and dramatic storylines and is a wonderful adaptation of the book and kind of replaces &#65533;Manhunter&#65533; from many years earlier. &#65533;Red Dragon&#65533; is just the forerunner to what was to come on &#65533;Silence Of The Lambs&#65533;. The movie kind of drags on a bit during the first 45 minutes or so but then really takes off from there and becomes an intense thriller. A definitely classic this film is! Two thumbs up!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good film - interesting"></head><body><p>This film is very well made and its subject matter is about a man's (Nicolas Cage) ability to see about 2 minutes into the future. In real life it's a rare ability that some people have in some particular area(s).<br /><br />Cage's character, who uses his ability to perform magic tricks in a stenchy Las Vegas downtown casino, has been waiting for his true love (Jessica Biel) for years and he saw her in his mind for years. Once he meets her in a Diner, his abilities extend to see the future a couple of hours in advance, and he realizes that based on his actions he can change the immediate future to some extent.<br /><br />And that's the interesting part of the film to see various possible outcomes of the immediate future if he, Cage's character, makes this or that decision/action at the moment. This flick is executed very well, and yes, because Cage being an Elvis fan to the bone, there's some Elvis touch in there. Nicolas Cage, who years ago I wouldn't have cared to see him in any movie, has grown as an actor and again delivers a superb performance - he's really a great actor.<br /><br />Julian Moore wasn't too exciting as she plays a special FBI agent or something, but her character and performance seems flat. Also, the script had its problems with some lose ends here and there as well as some high-school quality dialogue with the lines of the supporting actors at times.<br /><br />Jessica Biel is appealing as usual and she ads color and brings life/authenticty to the film.<br /><br />The overall storyline of the nuclear bomb threat seems somewhat of an afterthought, but that's okay, because I think the main issue is that phenomenon of certain people having the ability to see briefly ahead for a few seconds or a minute and making certain decisions based on such an ability, while in this flick of course the ability is Hollywood overemphasized, but it's a movie. Why do I give this film 4 stars, because it's stylish, and the acting escpecially by Nicolas Cage is excellent, and it's interesting and a fun film to watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock's Masterpiece"></head><body><p>This movie works on so many levels, right down to the clever choices of colours for the actors costumes.  Hitchcock created a tour de force showcase for Jimmy Stewart (only Rope ranks has a better performance) and the simply beautiful beyond words Kim Novack.  The pace is mermserising, slowly drawing you deeper and deeper into the complex study of man and fears and his obsessions.<p>Just does not get any better than this!  You might also check out Bell, Book and Candle which teams Stewart and Novak (even more beautiful then) in another charming tale.</p></body></html>

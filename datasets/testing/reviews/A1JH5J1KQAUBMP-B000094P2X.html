<meta name="summary" content="Not quite as good as &quot;Silence,&quot; much better than &quot;Hannibal&quot;"></head><body><p>In a story set before the events of &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; FBI investigator Will Graham (Edward Norton) returns from an early retirement to hunt for a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes) with assistance from the imprisoned Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins, of course).  I was leery about this one, especially because the director, Brett Ratner, has not done very much good work in the past.  However, he really rose to the challenge here.  He understands the Lecter character and has put together a very suspenseful, scary movie.  The outstanding cast does a wonderful job.  Ted Tally, who wrote the screenplay for SOTL, also took on the writing chores here and acquitted himself well.</p></body></html>

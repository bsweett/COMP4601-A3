It was too long, too boring, and DID NOT rewrite the "zombie genre" which so many people claimed it did.  I found the the plot jumpy and inconsistent.  There was no real "feel" of terror.  All that being said, I think the main thing that failed this movie was the outside over-hype.  It was nothing that I expected, because if it had been, then it would have been good.  Sorry, can't recommend this one.</p></body></html>

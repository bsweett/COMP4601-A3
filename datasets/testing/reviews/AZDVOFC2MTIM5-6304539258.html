<meta name="summary" content="SW Episode IV- the classic original"></head><body><p>Let's face it,although a bit dated and flawed in places, the original Star Wars(aka Episode IV A New Hope) is a movie that broke the mold on movie blockbusters.Although slightly altered by George Lucas in recent years, it's still a fascinating movie to behold.<br /> Although hard to comprehend to younger movie goers, when SW first came out in 1977, it was a ground breaking movie with it's state of the arts special effects, which continue to push the bounderies over the past quarter century, and it's fast paced editing.Where most recent science fiction movies were dark, cerebral and apocolyptic,(2001- A Space Odessy, Planet Of The Apes, and Lucas' own THX 1138), SW was an all out action movie that featured heroes to cheer for(Luke Skywalker, Han Solo,Leia Organa), as well as villians to hiss at(Grand Moff Tarkin, and of course, Darth Vader).George Lucas referenced his characters on literary and cinematic classics.<br />  Lucas' enthusiasm for his work  brings out the weaker points of the movie.The acting and screenplay are a bit over the top(Luke's whining,Darth Vader sounding more like a mad scientist, than the sinister figure of Empire Strikes Back), and even the dialogue comes off as forced (Tarkin's foul stench?).<br />  The flaws are petty compared to the impact of the  movie, and the love from fans who would still wait in line for weeks until a new episode .</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shouldn't have won the Oscar and definietly shouldn't have won best screenplay!"></head><body><p>It's an okay movie. the action scenes were very suspenseful and the main character's story arc is okay. he goes on his mission of indignation when he finds out his little kid friend is killed only to see that he was still alive and that he really is what his team mates say; an adrenaline seeking fool. this would have worked better for me if the ending wasn't him going back to serve for 365 more days! what exactly did this guy learn about himself?!! also all the sub plots were weak, the african american character who wants to be a father, (why?! where are these emotions coming from? yes you risk death everyday but why fatherhhood? WHY?), the white guy whose afraid of dying seemed forced. these themes are thrown at us instead of unraveled like a good screenplay should be! i can't believe this won best screenplay! the military doctor getting killed was too predictable! it's an okay movie with great suspenseful action but as a war movie about the soldiers it sort of fails. i have a feeling this movie winning was purely political. shouldn't have even been nominated.</p></body></html>

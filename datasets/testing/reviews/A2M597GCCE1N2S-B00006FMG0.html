<meta name="summary" content=""He's my son.....""></head><body><p>Road to Perdition is a story of betrayal, affection, respect, and heartbreak, as Tom Hanks, Jude Law, Paul Newman, and Tyler Hoechlin [the young kid] come together in this intriguing film.....<br /><br />Tom Hanks stars as Michale Sullivan, a hit man who works for an older man named John Rooney [Paul Newman] in the early 1930's. When Sullivan's oldest son [Tyler Hoechlin] witnesses an unplanned murder on one of Sullivan's mob hits, Sullivan is determined to have his son keep it to himself.<br /><br />However Hanks character's world is turned upside down as he is betrayed by his mob family and his wife and youngest son are killed in fear that the kid will tell the police of the mob hit. Sullivan takes his remaining son and goes on the run, always looking over his shoulder and swearing revenge on the man who killed his family [Who also was Rooney's son in the first place.]<br /><br />Paul Newman portrays John Rooney, the mob boss himself, a man who is nearing the end of his time, but is still intimidating and powerful none the less. He himself has great respect for Sullivan, and even cares for him like a father would for a son [Ironic, isn't it?]<br /><br />The main plotline is both Sullivan and his son on the run, looking for a new safe place to live. There are other littler plot lines that keep the movie entertaining:<br /><br />From Sullivan teaching his son to drive the car so he can rob banks to get money to keep them alive, to even Rooney hiring a hit man/photographer [Jude Law]to track down the two runaways and kill them. So many great actors, one movie that will assure you the acting will never get dull.<br /><br />Not to let too much info get out [in case you haven't seen the movie yet] I will say that the interaction between Newman and Hanks near the end in the church is absolute gold, where both men have their final respects and say what they think about each other.<br /><br />Jude Law gives a chilling performance as a photographer who takes pictures of the dead because he was always captivated by the way they looked like and how they lay still. His interaction with Hanks in the diner is chilling, telling Hanks what he thinks of his line of work as a photographer as he loads a camera [and also a gun under the bench.]<br /><br />The ending is surprsing [At least I thought so] and a powerful message from the son gives this movie a 5 star rating.<br /><br />The extras include commentary by the director, Sam Mendes, and also some of the actors. Deleted scenes, with alternate commentary, a photo gallery, and also HBO's "Making of Documentary." of the movie.</p></body></html>

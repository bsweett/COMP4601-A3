Eminem pulls out all the stops here with a strong performance as a somewhat alter version of himself, a white boy growing up in Detroit with dreams to be a rapper.  What makes this film better than the weight of the plot is, first the A list cast including Kim Bassinger and Mikhi Phifer but it's the brilliant script and excelent direction that picks this movie up and carries it further then plot alone would.  Yes, this may or may not be how Eminem got his breaks in life but regardless, this film, watched as a fictional story and not an autobiography will do well to make the difference.  Eminem shows true talent as his charactor (Rabbit) tries to rise above the life he was given, the drunk mother and the slum living conditions, the ex-girlfriend who took him for everything and the dead beat friends he's determined not to become.  Rabbit wants more for himself and for his family, and he's determined to work hard to get it.  Throw in a new love interest (Britany Murphy in a peformance to make you go GA'GA) and some rival thugs and you have a simple plot turned great movie with subplots that hold your interest and keep you in anticipation of the next scene.  Great film all the way around.</p></body></html>

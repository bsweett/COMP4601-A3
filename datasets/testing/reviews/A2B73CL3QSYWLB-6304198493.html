<meta name="summary" content="Film Falls Short of Classic Status"></head><body><p>There is much to recommend "The Usual Suspects" for.  The film is surehandedly directed by first-timer Bryan Singer.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  The script, that won an Oscar, keeps you guessing until the very end.  What I'm not certain of is whether this film meets the status as a modern day classic.  It is certainly one of the more ambitious films in recent memory.  In my mind, though, it may be a little to slick for it's own good and it wraps things up a little too tidy.  That said, this film has a rabid partisan following that is understandable and I recommend this film to those who haven't seen it and let them judge it for themselves.</p></body></html>

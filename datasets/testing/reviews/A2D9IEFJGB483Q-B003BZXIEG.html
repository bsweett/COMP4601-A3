That is the source of all the problems that X3 had.  Bryan Singer had a specific vision for the series, which is impossible for Brett Ratner, to reproduce.  When Singer jumped ship to do "Superman Returns," this film and franchise was doomed.  As always, the fans (i.e. the people who pay YOUR bills) were hurt the worst.<br /><br />This film focuses on two threads: Magneto's War and Phoenix.  In order to make this film work, they had to eliminate the deadwood, viz. Professor X (whose sole purpose in the first two films was not to lead, but to get captured) and Cyclops (who, in order to highlight Wolverine as field commander, was written as a wienerschnitzel).  As I watched the two deaths, I realized that 20 Century Fox was taking a cue from TV Fox's "24."  Sudden deaths make for an exciting story, because you don't know who is going to go next, but at times--as happens in "24"--the unpredictably can itself become too predictable.<br /><br />So with the leader and the field commander gone, the questions is--will Halley Barry want to come back as the next field commander, and will Kelsey Grammer want to dawn the blue fir again?  Or maybe the oblique reference to transferring the consciousness into the body of another being means they can have Professor X back, but with a less-expensive actor?<br /><br />Phoenix was mostly a prop, and as I saw her rather disturbing black-eyed, wild-haired psychic whirlwind sequences, I kept thinking about the previews for the Omen remake.  The Phoenix Seduction and Tragedy only works if you like Cyclops.  By writing Cyclops they way they did, Singer painted Ratner into a corner.  And, once again, the fans (i.e. the people who pay YOUR bills) were hurt the worst.<br /><br />The film is at its best--and most intelligent--when it focuses on Magneto's War.  It is a metaphor for racism (Mystiques reference to her "slave name" is smouched from Malcolm X), prejudice, and the Holocaust. The question of the anti-mutant of course, reminds us of the nature/nurture discussion and the hot issue of curing homosexuality.  Of course this is propaganda, but so was Star Trek, Twilight Zone, and Ray Bardberry.  The real question is with this is "Are you thinking, or merely being entertained?"<br /><br />In regards to the mutant cure, I am glad that they brought out how mutations affect people differently.  Mutants who could pass off for normal, such as Wolverine and Story hated the cure, but Rogue and Beast understood why a person would want to de-mutant themselves.<br /><br />There is a third thread--the subplots, all of which go by too quickly.  The Angle subplot--you got to love that introduction!--is not a subplot, but more of a book-end.  When we last saw Iceman, he was willing to work around Rogue's "problem," but now he seems to have turned on a dime.  This makes him seem less heroic, and after Rogue is "cured," what is going to happen to Sprite-Shadowcat-Kitty Pryde? And speaking of Kitty Pryde, where is Colossus's heart? And if Leech's anti-mutant is only mimicked, not replicated, will Rogue go back to her poison touch? And if Mystique goes back to being a mutant, why revenge will she wreck on Magneto?  Heh-heh-heh!<br /><br />Another sub-sub plot was the crowd sizes at the cur clinics.  Apparently there are a lot of mutants--low-level class one and two mutants.  This of course raises a deeper question--if so many people are mutants (factoring out the wannabes), it seems like they would represent a substantial voting block.  This would explain why Beast had such a high office, and why you could never have a Project Wideawake.<br /><br />Despite these problems, Brett Ratner did a marvelous job in keeping with the feel of the first two movies.  I thought the film worked well, and would welcome Rater to come back and do a film four.<br /><br />PS--so will the next film be a part four, or will it be a reboot?</p></body></html>

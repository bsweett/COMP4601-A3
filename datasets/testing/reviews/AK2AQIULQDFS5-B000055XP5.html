<meta name="summary" content="20th Century Fox Sure Know How To Make Special Editions."></head><body><p>&quot;X-Men&quot; is a Great Movie (4 Stars) made even Better (5 Stars) by this Brilliant Special Edition DVD. The Extras are to Die For, (deleted scenes that you can insert into the film, Hugh Jackmans screen test and a making of that isn't just an extended Trailer) and the Box is one of the Greatest Ever Made. (tied with &quot;Fight Club&quot; which is also a Fox release)<p>Aussie Hugh Jackman assures his International Success with his Wolferine, a Leader and a Loner, Tough and Vulnerable, he conveys it all. For a film about a comic book, that is alot of Character Development. The Rest of the Cast are also Great and they Embody their roles wonderfully. Bryan Singers Direction is Suitably Good and he sets up a Sequal well by leaving alot of Unanswered Questions.<p>A Franchise is assured after this ones Box Office Takings.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Incredible Hulk is only credible.."></head><body><p>"The Incredible Hulk" is a romp in a Marvel Comics translation into film, but lacks the depth of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QDS">The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)</a>. What could have been absolutely astonishing becomes only credible viewing enjoyment, a great popcorn movie, as other reviewers have described it.<br /><br />Edward Norton is fine as the scientist Bruce Banner, but not outstanding. He does a credible job with the script as presented, but motive is lacking, a foundation for the story. The film--its writers, director--assumes viewer knowledge of the Marvel story, but a great film would fold the viewer into the story by providing missing background. We know what the Colonel wants but not why Banner was participating.<br /><br />So the film ends up being superficial--all show and no depth. I want to know more about Tim Roth's character, what motivates him. The film certainly gives nod to the stereotype of the military seeking troop enhancement at all costs. Are they all like that? As for William Hurt as the Colonel, he went beyond his usual acting portrayals to give us at least a thoughtful "villain" rather than his usual bullish portraits. I thought this character was the highlight of the film.<br /><br />And moon-struck Betty? How did these two get together? I have to assume that Betty and Banner worked together, but how? Showing her wearing a lab coat cannot take the place of some kind of explanation. What is their connection? I know that a film cannot be all-inclusive but some are. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA">Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition)</a> did just that! Now there's a five-star film!<br /><br />"Incredible Hulk" is certainly a well-made film--the cinematography is awesome!--but it takes more than film editing and CGI to make an incredible movie. Although I enjoyed the movie, I finished wanting just a little more. However, the final scene is something to cheer about! May it happen!</p></body></html>

I heard the reviews and Oscar nominations, but I had no idea what I was going to experience when I popped this into my DVD player.<p>What makes the film so oddly compelling is Adrien Brody's silent performance.  There are long sections of the film that smoulder on the screen with an eerily noisy silence.  Combined with the constant uncertainty of what will happen next, the film places the viewer unnervinngly on edge...for two and a half hours!  While it was undoubtedly the director's intent to convey the sense of imminent danger to the audience, much of the film involves Adrien Brody crawlingly silently through the rubble of ruined buildings. I can't help but to wonder if the film could have been shortened considerably with some careful editing of some of these long pauses, which ultimately do not provide much in the way of exposition or character development.<p>Also interesting to me as a music lover was the subtext of music transcending race and nationality, even between a Nazi and a Jew.  A commendable piece of filmmaking, although ultimately not quite as powerful as Schindler's List.</p></body></html>

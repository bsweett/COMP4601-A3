<meta name="summary" content="A study of characters in a horrible situation-Blu-ray offers slight improvement but this won't look good in HD"></head><body><p>First for those looking to buy the Blu-ray of this film--be aware that this was shot on standard definition home video equipment and it looks like it on both DVD and Blu-ray and while the image quality is improved somewhat on Blu-ray, you'll notice the defects much more as well. If you're thinking of upgrading to Blu-ray be aware this will NOT look that great on BD.<br /><br />First the obvious; 28 Days Later borrows from many sources. It's not so much a horror movie but a character study of people in a horrifying situation. 28 Days Later has much more in common with Hitchcock than (Tobe)Hooper. Danny Boyle focuses much more on character and the eerie situation the characters find themselves in more than the thrills and chills of Resident Evil. That's one of the strengths of this fine film. While it may ape Night of the Living Dead (the prototype for all these films), Boyle makes 28 Days Later worthwhile by focusing on how the characters adjust to their horrible situation.<br /><br />Jim wakes up in the hosptial after a biking accident. What's frightening is that he wakes up in a completely deserted building and, from all appearences, city. London is as quiet as a field mouse with no moving traffic and, more importantly, no signs of human life. He quickly discovers that a plague of some sort has broken out and that the uninfected residents were evacuated.<br /><br />He arrives at a church and goes inside. The church is filled with human bodies. Hoping that there might be someone alive in the building he calls out. Two of the "dead" bodies rapidly raise their heads staring right at him. More of the bodies stir. As Jim attempts to leave, he's confronted by a priest who clearly is suffering from the plague. He escapes but is being pursued by the walking dead. Suddenly, he's saved by two masked people who fight off the "Zombies" by burning them and, ultimately, blowing up the gas station where they've converged.<br /><br />Boyle manages to elicit moving performances from his young cast and captures all the torment, fear and sense of dread the survivors feel as they relate stories to each other about what has happened to them.<br /><br />The DVD includes three alternate endings (one of them in storyboard form with narration by the writer and director). One of the film's variations includes a completely different second half to the film (again, it's in storyboard form). This radical departure from the film's theatrical version is very interesting and suggests a completely different, darker film than what was ultimately shown in theaters. It's not surprising that they didn't film it (they had some narrative issues) as this version would have been a complete downer and the film wouldn probably not done as well at the box office as it did otherwise. It also feels a bit unnatural after having viewed the film's actual narrative course.<br /><br />The internet trailer, theatrical teaser and trailer (the latter two basically identical)and audio commentary by director and writer give a unique perspective to the viewer; it feels almost as if one has been working on the film.<br /><br />The DVD transfer looks very good considering that the film was originally shot on standard definition digital video and transferred to film. The sound -- both the effects and the soundtrack itself chillingly come to life on the DVD. While 28 Days Later is a horror movie it's not just slash and burn horror movie. It's a film with heart and, ultimately, more in the tradition of great horror films that examine how the characters cope with the horrible things they witness as the horrible things seen.</p></body></html>

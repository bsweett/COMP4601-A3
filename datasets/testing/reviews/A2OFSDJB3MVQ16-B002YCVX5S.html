<meta name="summary" content="A disappointing so-called war movie from Tarentino"></head><body><p>I walked out of the theatre after about an hour of this film by Quentin Tarentino because after seeing such WWII films like "Defiance" and "Valkyrie", it lacked authencity.  It seems that Tarentino basically gathered every cliche that he has seen in much better films like "The Dirty Dozen", "Underground" (an obscure film with Cornel Wilde), etc.--and thrown in a blender and out comes this monstrosity.  I even gave the film a second try on Blu-ray and still despite the favorable reviews, changed my opinion of this film.  The film lacks suspense and Tarentino over does it in the dialogue department--allowing a scene to go on much longer than it needs to be. Christoph Waltz's performance as the evil Nazi is perhaps the only saving grace in this disappointing film.</p></body></html>

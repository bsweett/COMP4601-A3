<meta name="summary" content="STILL THE BEST WEREWOLF MOVIE EVER"></head><body><p>David Naughton and Jenny Agutter were outstanding in John Landis' classic take on lyncanthrope, but Griffin Dunne as Naughton's friend, fellow victim ( fatally attacked by the same werewolf that mauls Naughton's character ), and rotting 'cheerleader' is gruesomely, outrageous. Rick Baker's FX work was simply amazing, and still holds up well ( it certainly beats the CGI 'mud puppies' created for AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS by a few lightyears ). The cinematography ( particularly on the moors ) is beautiful, and creepy. This is a genuinely scary movie, with a nice love-story, an excellent cast, and still the best transformation scene ever. Definitely a meat-lovers choice.</p></body></html>

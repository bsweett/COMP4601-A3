<meta name="summary" content="Okay, but even with Chris Rock just a patch on the original"></head><body><p>Adam Sandler is the straight man for most of this remake of "The Longest Yard," starting when his character, former NFL quarterback Paul Crewe, is hauled off to prison for taking his wife's Bentley for a late night drive and finding a way to wreck a whole lot of cop cars while standing still.  If you have seen the trailer for this 2005 film then you have really seen most of Sandler's funniest bits.  However, most of the funny lines go to Chris Rock, and you are not going to be able to see them on a trailer or repeat them in polite company for that matter.  Unfortunately, Rock's character of Caretaker does not get to stand on the sidelines and make jokes during the big game because that honor goes to ESPN's Chris Berman and color man Baby Face Bob (Steve Reevis), which is too bad because Rock is a lot funnier, especially without a script.<br /><br />The basic situation is the same as the original.  Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) is proud of his football team made up of prison guards but insists Crewe help his team prepare for the new season.  Crewe's suggestion is for the guards to play a tune-up game against some weak opponent they can crush.  The warden loves the idea and insists Crewe put together a team of inmates to be the requisite cannon fodder.  The problem is that all the murderers, thieves and rapists in the prison do not like Crewe because he was kicked out of the NFL for point shaving.  So he has to put together a rag-tag team of misfits and psychotics until the real bad studs come out to play.  There are some bumps along the way but apparently these convicts can run around in the middle of the night all they want and eventually we get to the big game between the Guards and the Cons (a.k.a. the "Mean Machine").<br /><br />All of the best scenes in this movie come on the football field, where the goal is usually to come up with the most viscous hits ever seen in a football movie.  The two most famous bits from the original movie pop up in this one as well with only one slight variation on what we enjoyed the first time around way back in 1974.  How different are these two films?  Well, the warden's secretary was played by Bernadette Peters in the original and this time around Cloris Leachman gets to milk the role for more than it is worth.  But I can make a better case for the more important difference that while the original had to do with the quest for human dignity this one is more violence for the sake of violence.  Crewe has to remind the players that any bones the guards break are going to heal, but beating them will be something none of them will ever forget.  But since Burt Reynolds is around to play the coach ("Iron" Mike Conrad in the original) instead of the quarterback this time around, there is an implicit stamp of approval, although my guess is Reynolds knows these guys are just making the original look even better.<br /><br />It is strange that MTV Films is part of the mix on this one because the familiar faces tend to be from "Saturday Night Live" (e.g., Tracy Morgan), ESPN (e.g., Dan Patrick, Jim Rome), and the NFL (e.g., Brian Bosworth, Bill Romanowski).  Then there is Michael Irvin who would count for both the NFL and ESPN, and Nelly, who counts record sales.  Also running around are Steve "Stone Cold" Austin, from the wonderful world of wrestling, and playing the role in the film I would most like to have seen cut is Nicholas Turturro, who learns there are worst things then filming a nude scene on "N.Y.P.D. Blue."  But for it me it was the fact that not long after I was thinking that Bob Sapp as Switowski was one of the biggest human beings I had ever seen along comes Dalip Singh as Turley to prove me wrong.  The only thing is that there are so many of these characters running around that not everybody gets to have a decent payoff while the difference between steroids and estrogen is driven into the ground.<br /><br />Strange to realize we live in a world where the appearance of Rob Schneider yelling, "You can do it!" is greeting by an audience with something akin to delight.  For me it was nice to see Ed Lauter who played Captain Knauer in the original film putting in an appearance in this one, although the cameo was bittersweet given that Eddie Albert died at the age of 99 the day this remake opened (and the obituary in the paper did not mention he was the warden in the original despite the fact everybody was impressed that the guy from "Green Acres" played a villain so well).  I was rather disappointed by the sports media people who play themselves and ended up rounding down on this one because the humor was not up to "BASEketball" standards let alone "Major League."  Chris Rock makes the first half of the film enjoyable and the football game delivers for the most part at the end, but in the final analysis I think that the actors had more fun remaking "The Longest Yard" than we had watching it.</p></body></html>

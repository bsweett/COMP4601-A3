There's not as much as the sequels, but there is enough to make it edgy and exciting.<br />*Lots of memorable parts.  The scenes of the future war are stark and frightening.  The finale is great.<br />*Excellent filming style.  It's very fresh, original, and memorable.<br />*Good story.  It's very simple but also very original.<br />*Good characters.  The actors are excellent.<br />*Good music theme.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A little slow in the middle.<br /><br />This is still one of the most quintessential sci-fi movies ever made.  Its simple premise is executed effectively, leaving lots of room for strong characters, gripping action, and some good emotional moments.  It is also well-filmed, and contains some good special effects for its time.  The only downside is that the drama becomes a little intense towards the middle, slowing down the momentum.  Still, it really is one of the best.</p></body></html>

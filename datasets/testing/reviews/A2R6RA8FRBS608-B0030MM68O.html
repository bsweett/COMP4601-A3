The acting is easily some of the best I've ever seen; and along with that hand-held camera style of photography I genuinely felt as if I were watching a documentary about real people instead of a film with Hollywood actors in it. In addition, the choreography works wonders for the film; the script was well written and the casting was superbly done.<br /><br />It isn't long before we meet three soldiers who take on the task of deactivating bombs: Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner), who gets a drug-like thrill from being the one to go in and deactivate bombs even when he doesn't have to and his two backup men Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and the somewhat troubled Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) who talks to the company shrink but doesn't ever get comfortable with the war the way William James does.<br /><br />I could say so much about this movie, including what James' "hurt locker" represents but then I would be giving too much away. Suffice it to say that the movie is essentially a series of sequences that show the difficulties and the life-or-death stakes the troops face as portrayed by the characters James, Sanborn and Eldridge. There's plenty of action, tension and thriller aspects that add to the overall quality of the film; and the cameos we get from greats like Ralph Fiennes are wonderful. Look also for well done cameos by Evangeline Lilly as Connie James and Guy Pearce as Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson. Christopher Sayegh does an excellent job of playing the role of Beckham, a young boy who gets caught up with William James as the film progresses.<br /><br />If the film has any flaw, I would say that they could have edited down just a bit of the war footage and added just a few minutes more to the scenes in which Williams James is a civilian.<br /><br />In addition, the DVD comes with a "behind the scenes" featurette and an optional running commentary.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker will forever be one of the great movies about the modern day war in Iraq. I highly recommend this film for people interested in this subject; and people who enjoy thrillers, action movies and even dramas would do well to add this to their collections.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="strange"></head><body><p>i liked it. it kept me wondering. well the film is backwards. it starts withwhat would be the end sequence and ends with the beginning. it is a superb mystery about a guy whos wife was murdered but by who. there are so many suspects. this movie does exit the plot once in a while to fill in another great sequence. overall this is not for everyone. if you dont like confusion dont rent or buy it. but if you like to be confused this is your movie.</p></body></html>

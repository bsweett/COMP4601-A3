Yes, all 4 films are here and all are presented wonderfully. But really, it's the extras here that are the star attractions for this release. By now, you have heard how large the extras are and how "exhaustive" they are. So wonderfully true. Going thru every disc and feeding on the special features that are here is an epic adventure in itself right along with the actual films. 9 discs in all!. Each film comes with a second disc full of all the bonus features. Almost every person imaginable is here and accounted for in the documentaries. There are featurettes on how the films got started, Pre-production featurettes, sketches, designs, trailers, differnt camera angle scenes, deleted/extended scenes, commentaries, photo galleries, special effects and creature designs, H.R. Giger, and so on. It seems endless. The bonus disc even has a new 64 minute documentary on the first film, a Ridley Scott Q&A and more. Seriously, you will be suffering from Alien overload once you are done with this set. You already know the films, so there is no real need to go into detail about every one. Each film comes in two versions - the original theatrical run, and a director's cut version. Some of those new cuts enhance the films(Aliens), some are unnecessary(Alien), and some just don't make that much of a difference(Alien 3 and 4). 1979's "Alien" is a classic masterpiece. Truly original and brilliant. The extras are great. Where is Yaphett Kotto and Ian Holm?. 1986's "Aliens" was one of those rare sequels that is just as good, if not better, than the original. James Cameron isn't as involved as other directors in the new features, but he is there. I find the documentaries and behind the scenes features here the most interesting. The demanding Cameron, the clashes with the London crew, and so on. Good stuff. 1992's "Alien 3" was where it fell apart. Fincher is a great director, and there are some good moments, but it was a major disappointment. The documentaries and features are far more fascinating. Once you watch them, you may feel for Fincher and how Alien 3 was an uphill battle from the get go. Fincher is also the only director who doesn't appear in new interviews for this set. 1997's "Alien Resurrection" was an improvement, but by no means was anywhere near as good as the first two. Writer Joss Whedon(of Buffy fame)has condemned the film every chance he gets. Resurrection is entertaining and has some good moments and factors to it. The film is not great, but it's not the unwatchable abomination Whedon thinks it is. If not that isn't enough, the set comes with a booklet that has a small overview of every film, and tells you where the extras are, what can be found on each disc, and their running time. The Alien Quadrilogy set is a mammoth experience that hasn't been matched yet. I can't imagine what it would take to even go further than this box set. The Alien films are batting 2 out of 4, but even the lesser films are better than a lot of other stuff that is out there. This is a must have.</p></body></html>

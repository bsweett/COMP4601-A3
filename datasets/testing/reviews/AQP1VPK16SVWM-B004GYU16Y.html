<meta name="summary" content="Solid thriller spiced up by plot twists of other thrillers  3 1/2 stars"></head><body><p>REVIEW FOR BLU-RAY EDITION ONLY:<br /><br />I'll be honest when I first saw "Salt" I was a bit underwhelmed because frankly the trailer set me up for a different thriller.  Sure some (or most depending on how well you know the thriller genre)of the twists in "Salt" are clever but what makes "Salt" a step above most mediocre thrillers is how the director unfolds his story. "Salt" is a good if predictable film where some of the cliches of the genre are turned inside out. "Salt" plays as a cross between "No Way Out" (itself a remake of "Out of the Past") and the Bourne movies and, although not as good as those films, manages to be an entertaining thrill ride with plenty of action so you don't really notice some of the holes in the plot until after the movie is over.<br /><br />Image quality is exceptionally crisp without being over process. The lossless audio sounds exceptional and is immersive. We get subtitles with this as well.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW:<br /><br />Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt a CIA agent who suddenly finds herself being hunted when a rogue Soviet spy master named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski)shows up and states that she is a Soviet spy and is there to kill the Russian President who will be attending the funeral of the Vice President of the United States. While Salt denies that she is a Soviet spy everything including the fact that she goes on the run indicates to her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schrieber) and Counter Intelligence Agent Peabody (Chiewetel Ejiofor)that she is, indeed, a Soviet spy who has been living and working undercover for most of her life. Salt claims she has gone on the run because whenever a spy's cover is blown their entire family is taken out and she's concerned that the only person in her life her husband will be assassinated.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Directed by veteran thriller director Phillip Noyce ("Clear and Present Danger", "The Quiet American", "Rabbit Proof Fence") and written by Kurt Wimmer ("Law Abiding Citizen", "Street Kings")"Salt" plays with the expectations of the thriller genre with both Noyce and Wimmer knowing use the twists and turns of other films. What really sells "Salt" though are the performances and the stunts in the film as well as the ingenious flashback story that is integrated into the main film revealing almost everything about Salt well before the midway point of the movie. While these attributes don't save the movie entirely, it does make the film diverting and entertaining.<br /><br />There are some gaps in logic/the narrative but these are pretty easy to over look because you end up if you become involved in the movie. The ending which sets up a sequel wasn't quite as conclusive as it should have been as they could easily have left it open on the theatrical version but given us a bit more closure for the audience. Most films that leave an opening this large just don't work and it is a major Achille's heel for "Salt".<br /><br />You can watch the "Director's Cut" an "Unedited Version" or the theatrical cut of the film with the Blu-ray. You should note that the story unfolds and is resolved in a slightly different fashion with the "Director's Cut" rather than the theatrical cut. As to which one you enjoy most, it'll, again, depend on your expectations of the movie but most of the changes are fairly cosmetic (i.e., don't add or subtract from the overall impact of the film).<br /><br />There's also featurettes on the production of the movie as well as Noyce providing a commentary track that is quite interesting particularly when it comes to the decisions for the editing decisions made for the film.<br /><br />If you set your expectations aisde set up from the preview trailer, "Salt" is an enjoyable action flick (of course it has little to do with reality but when was the last time you saw an action flick that DID have something to do with reality) and you might want to give it a chance to "prove" it's case.</p></body></html>

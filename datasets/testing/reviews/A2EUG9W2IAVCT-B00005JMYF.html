<meta name="summary" content="Likable and entertaining comedy"></head><body><p>Though not a classic in terms of Hollywood comedies, Dodgeball does have its moments.  The performances (with the exception of the brilliant Justin Long and superb Christine Taylor) sometimes get over the top and so stereotypical they're unbelievable--but the film's many comedic points keep most of those elements out of mind.  Regardless of its obvious flaws Dodgeball is an entertaining and at times inspirational film.</p></body></html>

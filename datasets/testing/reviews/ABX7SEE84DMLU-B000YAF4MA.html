<meta name="summary" content="It's The End of All Strain, It's the Joy In Your Heart"></head><body><p>Two world-class actors work together and have a hellacious time, and we get to share that fun.  And we get to see Rob Morrow practice medicine again.<br /><br />The plot's wildly improbable and pretty simple:  two guys learn that they are going to die, and assemble and execute a list of things they will do before they kick the bucket.  BTW, the scene where Morgan Freeman gets his initial cancer diagnosis (on a cell phone, which is also improbable) is wonderfully performed.  There are other scenes which reminded me of my wife's career work as a family advocate;  she takes care of family members and visitors of emergency room patients.  Arguably the first part of the movie is just like a day at work for her and for millions of other doctors, nurses and caregivers.<br /><br />One item on the bucket list was "to kiss the most beautiful girl in the world."  In this movie, Jack Nicholson's character gets to do that by kissing his granddaughter, whom it looked like he'd never met before.<br /><br />I shared a song with the most beautiful girl in the world many years ago, called "The Waters of March," written by Antonio Carlos Jobim.  The lyrics sound like nonsense;  my girl and I used to debate what they meant.<br /><br />But the last words of the "doggerel" are, "It's the end of all strain, it's the joy in your heart."  While looking at the Pyramids, Morgan Freeman tells Jack that the ancient Egyptians believed that, at death, you were asked two questions to gain admittance to heaven:  did you have joy, and did you bring joy to others.<br /><br />Mayve Jobim and the ancient Egyptians synched up.  Death is surely the end of all strain, and what matters is the joy in your heart.<br /><br />Nicholson tries to attain heaven by bringing his brand of erotic joy to Freeman;  Freeman's decision to decline the offer regains him his marriage.<br /><br />Freeman tries to attain heaven by bringing his brand of family joy to Nicholson;  Nicholson's immediate reaction is rage, anguish and withdrawal, wonderfully acted (reminded me a little of Nicholson's work in "Carnal Knowledge").<br /><br />But the common thread was family.  Shelby Mustangs, Himalayas and skydiving aside, family is what brings us the greatest joy, and we can only get what we give.<br /><br />So, kiss the most beatiful girl in the world, and don't put it off.  Embrace your family and find the greatest joy there is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Why oh why oh why?"></head><body><p>Ready for the movie?  Ready for the Ultimate Edition?  Ready for the Special Ultra Limited Collector (with numbering) 10-disc edition?<p>What am I driving at?  I would love a show of hands of who is sick and tired of a series of movies being released, only to in turn have special releases with deleted scenes, and in turn ultimate releases with deleted scenes, making of documentaries, etc.<p>So, after having purchased Legacy when it first came out, we are now presented with the Quadrilogy -- after getting past the initial guffaws of the title, I'm annoyed that YET ANOTHER SPECIAL EDITION HAS BEEN SLIPPED PAST ME.<p>Case in point -- Lord of the Rings.  I was disgusted to learn that after having purchased Fellowship that they were going to release ANOTHER edition that had added footage, etc.  The same has been done with Terminator 2, Stargate, and Army of Darkness.  Although it has not been done yet, I would not be surprised if Lucas follows suit <p>If you're going to release something, do it right the first time and stop wasting our money.<p>Five stars for LEGACY.  1 star for the blatant commercialism that Quadrilogy intends to reap.</p></body></html>

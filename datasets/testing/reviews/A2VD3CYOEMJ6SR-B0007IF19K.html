<meta name="summary" content="Foxx is best actor"></head><body><p>Ray Charles works his way, blind, on a cross country bus trip from Florida to Seattle. He wanders the streets seeking to get into the local jazz scene. He forms a romatic relationship. He gets married then cheats on his wife. He gets hooked on heroin and begins to jerk arond and scratch himself, as so many addicts do. He sits at the piano, playing and singing with a huge grin on his face. He goes into rehab and undergoes the agonies of detoxing. He.... wait, what was that? That wasn't Ray Charles???? That was an actor named Jaime Foxx? No it can't be, it's too real!!!<br /><br />Anyway, you get the picture. Jaime Foxx was the incarnation of Ray Charles. A great contrast would be a competing actor for best picture. Like Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio also played a public figure, Howard Hughes. However, in watching the Aviator, you always are aware that it is DiCaprio portraying Hughes. Foxx, on the other hand becomes Ray Charles. You forget that it is an actor portraying Charles. This is one of the most convincing acting jobs I have ever seen. Jaimee Foxx truly deserves his best actor Oscar.</p></body></html>

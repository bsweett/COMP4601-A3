<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies in recent years"></head><body><p>This is one movie that deserved all the acclaim it got. Forrest Gump is one of the most original ideas for a movie ever created. It follows the unbelievable life of Forrest Gump and the humorous and heartbreaking journeys that he endures in war, love, and life. Hanks is wonderful as the slow, but innocent Forrest and there are so many great and powerful moments in this movie. I think it is so enduring because it is about the human experience, and we, as an audience, feel for Forrest as he must learn life and the problems life presents. It is an experience that we all must go through, and I recommend this movie to anyone.</p></body></html>

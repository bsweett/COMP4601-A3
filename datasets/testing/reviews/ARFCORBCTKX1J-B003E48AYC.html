<meta name="summary" content="Dark, morbid, violent -- NOT for the kids."></head><body><p>"Alice in Wonderland" is a literary/intellectual story, full of clever ideas and wordplay, which render it essentially unfilmable. It's highly episodic and has no particular point (unlike "Though the Looking Glass", which at least offers the conceit that the story represents a chess game). But its fantasy elements have tempted too many filmmakers who ought to have known better.<br /><br />I haven't seen every version, but up to now, the least-bad has been -- yes -- the 1951 Disney version, which, when it sticks with the original, is quite good. But I've long felt that, if you're going to turn "Alice" into a film, it should be aimed at adults, and emphasize the darker elements of the story.<br /><br />This is what Tim Burton has finally given us. Linda Woolverton (who penned several successful Disney features) put together a script that provides dramatic movement -- Alice is destined to kill the Jabberwock *, which the Red Queen uses to threaten those who would oppose her. Whether this is the best-possible dramatic arc, I don't know, but it's at least broadly consistent with the original story. It also roughly parallels Alice's need to stand up for herself and reject the wussy twit her mother and late father's business partner have chosen for her to marry. Yes, this is trite and obvious -- but how many basic storylines /are/ there? This is one of the two most-basic -- someone has to make an important decision. (The other is "someone wants something they're blocked from getting".)<br /><br />Not only is the Burton/Woolverton take on the story dark, but so is the imagery. With the exception of the White Queen's abode, "Underland" is a dark and often-dismal place. This is absolutely not a film for children much under the age of 12. It comes close to PG-13, not so much for content, but for tone. The tykes will neither appreciate it nor enjoy it.<br /><br />Adults probably will. Recommended, if you like your fairy tales on the dark side.<br /><br />PS: I just made some revisions and noted the "5 out of 11" helpful votes. (As we all know, these votes are more-often based on whether a review correlates with what the reader /hopes/ the review will say, rather than whether it provides any useful information.) What do you /want/ me to say, that this "Alice" is one of the greatest family films of all time, and you should grab the kids and rush right out in a viewing frenzy? Well, it isn't, and you shouldn't. It's a film for teens (not tykes) and adults. I've told you why, and you ought to be grateful enough to give the review a "helpful" vote. So there.<br /><br />* With one exception, the Jabberwock is referred to as the "Jabberwocky" -- but that's the name of the poem, not the monster. It's perhaps worth noting the Tenniel's drawing of the monster is rather uglier and more-frightening that Burton's. I'm surprised it wasn't used.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good horror film"></head><body><p>A very good zombie film, it even surpasses its predecessor, the very worthy 28 Days Later. Directed by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, the movie starts 28 weeks after the first film. With the first outbreak apparently ended, an American led military force arrives at the deserted London (in a not so subtle allusion to the occupation of Iraq), securing certain areas and allowing English citizens who have been abroad during the outbreak to return. Among them are two children (played by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton; one of the best scenes of the movie has nothing to do with zombies and have them running through the deserted streets of the English capital). As expected, though, the zombies have not exactly disappeared, and are bound to return with a vengeance. Robert Carlyle does a fine turn here as a survivor of the first outbreak who becomes infected here (and the opening scene is great). Intelligent, very bloody, entertaining, what more can you ask from a horror film.</p></body></html>

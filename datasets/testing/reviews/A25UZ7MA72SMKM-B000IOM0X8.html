Once you get over that implausible sounding premise, you have a fine and very fun movie.<br /><br />The stars are personable and humorous in their roles, the action is exciting, and you lose yourself in the story very quickly. Of course, the book is another chip off the ol' Indiana Jones block, and therefore most of what you see is pretty derivative. Considering that the majority of movies are derivative though, what is important is if you enjoy it. If you like most McConaughey movies, you'll like this one. If you don't particularly like the average McConaughey vehicle, give this a pass.<br /><br />The DVD presentation is solid. Both picture and sound are good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="62% more laughs if you can tolerate the annoying presentation"></head><body><p>I've seen the theatrical version of this film twice.  Once when it was in first run, and again now on Blu-ray.  To be blunt, I thought the film was ok when it was in first run, but wasn't impressed enough with it to want to see it again.  It was and is ok in my book, but I felt it lacked somewhat, at least when compared to my memories of the original TV series.<br /><br />Ah, the TV series.  Total camp, but fun at the same time.  Loved by enough viewers that I can see why it would seem to be a target to mine on the bigger screen, especially with someone like Steve Carell in the lead. Carell makes a good Maxwell Smart, and if the story were better, I think this one could have been a genuine 5 star hit.  Unfortunately, as others have said here, it missed it by that much :-(<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is ok in taking over the Barbara Feldon role, and Alan Arkin isn't bad as the chief.  Honestly none of the performances are disappointing to me, it's just that the story itself, at least from the theatrical version isn't as funny as it should be.<br /><br />Which brings me back to the 62% more laughs that are promised in the Blu-ray.  Ah, more laughs from promised bonus scenes actually sounds good and enticed me to give the Blu-ray a try, but ... the presentation is just so disappointing to me that I have got to slam it in this review.<br /><br />Offering up a director's cut or extended cut version of a film is something that I greatly appreciate, but if you are going to do it, by all that is right in the universe please do it in a way that respects the viewer and not as done here.<br /><br />Seamless branching has been around in the DVD format for a while and it's used here, but isn't even close to being seamless.  Far from it, it seems that if you turn on the bonus scene viewing version of the film you get a neat little icon of Maxwell Smart in the phone booth (or at least of the phone booth) to indicate that bonus materials are now being shown.  That's not bad but... the icon is much larger than it needs to be and obliterates part of the screen when it needn't have been so intrustive.  Even looking past that there's a greater annoyance -- when the bonus scenes are accessed there's an annoying pause present, at least when played on my PS3.  Just enough of a pause that you'll find yourself highly annoyed and will probably want to turn off the bonus scene feature asap.<br /><br />Sadly, from a cursory glance at the menus, there doesn't seem to be a way to just play the bonus scenes.  Instead you must access them in place.  I could be missing something obvious there, but then again, if it was obvious I don't think I would have missed it.<br /><br />So, to summarize, there's a disappointing story (at least in the theatrical version) that doesn't get the best from the talent on hand, and an even more disappointing presentation of the bonus scenes that make the experience less satisfying than it should be.  Missed it by that much indeed.</p></body></html>

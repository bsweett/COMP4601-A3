The plot also incorporates aspects of the Bourne novel "The Bourne Legacy" (2004) written by Eric Van Lustbader (born: 1946).<br /><br />It is a sequel to 2002's "The Bourne Identity" (as is 2007's "The Bourne Ultimatum").<br /><br />This movie continues the story of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), an amnesiac and former CIA assassin, and his attempt to learn more of his past.  This time the CIA what's to bring him in.  Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), a CIA Deputy Director and Task Force Chief who is pursuing Bourne says this more forcefully:<br /><br />"We're going to find this son of a b**ch and take him down.  I'm not having Jason Bourne destroy any more of this agency."<br /><br />Awesome fight scenes and breath-taking car chase scenes are two major highlights of this movie making it a state-of-the-art espionage thriller.  This movie is more dialogue driven compared to the first one making it for me, actually better than the first movie.<br /><br />Matt Damon as Jason Bourne effectively carries the entire movie.  Kudos should also go to Joan Allen as Director Pamela Landy for her intriguing performance.  I found the background music to be quite exhilarating.<br /><br />The various action scenes employ shaky camera work making them sometimes difficult to follow.  Some people may be put off by this but I found that this technique gave the movie a gritty, realistic, and edgy feel.<br /><br />Total box office for this movie was about two hundred and eighty-eight million, surpassing that brought in by "The Bourne Identity" (about two hundred and fourteen million).<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are many extras including an alternate ending.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie effectively continues the plight of a new action hero named Jason Bourne!!!<br /><br />(2004; 1 hr 40 min (excluding end credits), wide screen;  24 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></body></html>

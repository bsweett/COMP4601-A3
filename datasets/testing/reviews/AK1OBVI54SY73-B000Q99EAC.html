<meta name="summary" content="Wasn't Worth It..."></head><body><p>This movie was best never made in my opinion. There was really no point to it and it really just came off as cheesy and unbelievable.<br /><br />I mean Rocky is older, and although his character comes still quite strong as in any of the other films, everyone around him are just weak and lacking characters. Steps, his son, Paulie even are just standing around with frowns and a frozen stare for most of the film while Rocky still goes on and on about the world being lousy and you have to take your hits and get back up- you know all the same stuff he went on about in the other films before. And now it is just old to hear about.<br /><br />Along with the lack of any real characters to care about besides Rocky, the story itself is just a little too unbelievable in my opinion. He being able to last in the ring with that young and uninteresting boxer I found a little silly and it wasn't played out in any way exciting.<br /><br />The story is boring, the characters are worse- the only thing that helps this movie go to just 'okay' status is Rocky himself. After loving the character for so long through Rocky 1-4 (5 was pretty iffy too for me) you want to see how he turns out regardless. But besides the loveable Rocky character, nothing else is worthwhile to watch. So I say stick with Rocky 1-4, even 5 for it did have its moments, but it's not worth the time to watch this one. I just felt this last movie wasn't worth the time or money making it.<br /><br />3/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just when..."></head><body><p>Just when I thought no film on the planet could ever scare the &^%$ out of me, the remake of "Dawn of the Dead" comes along and proves me horribly wrong (no pun intended).  I have seen just about every horror flick that was deemed so-called "Scary" in recent years, but this one tops them all.  I may honestly have nightmares, something I've only had over my failed marriages in those same recent years - LOL.  This blood bath is so frightening I held my own hand throughout the film.  It didn't help.  I jumped out of my skin so often I felt like a 50-year-old iguana.<br /><br />Loosely based on the original film by George Romero back in 1978 (26 years ago), this is a must for every horror fan.  I don't think a film has taken me on this type of ride since "Silence of the Lambs" and "The Exorcist".  Even then, "Lambs" could be considered a "slow" movie when compared to the "Dead".  I had never heard this quote before today's feature.  It explains so well the true nature of zombies:  "When there's no more room in Hell. The dead will walk the earth."  And they do...<br /><br />Many of my colleagues have seen this film.  Two of them told me they walked out of the theatre...1) for the non-stop gore  2) for the scene with the pregnant girl.  Trust me my buds, if you like flesh-crawling terror, this one is for you.  I will be first in line to buy this DVD when it hits the market.  It is so well done (considering the source), I was actually looking over my shoulder during the screening.  This was a lunchtime treat at my local theatre and there were only three people in the audience (it's been out for four weeks).<br /><br />Furthermore, if you are a Quentin Tarantino fan (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs), then you must know what he said in a recent issue of "Entertainment Weekly".  When asked, "So what recent movies have you enjoyed?", Tarantino responded, "I can't believe it, but I really liked the remake of "Dawn of the Dead".  It was terrific.  I don't really expect to see much better film-making in any set piece this year than that.  I was almost offended when (they announced) a remake - I mean, the idea of remaking a George Romero film without George Romero!.  And there are things about the new "Dead" that don't compare favorably at all. In the original, Romero used mostly amateur actors from Pittsburgh and they're giving their all, and you just completely buy into these characters in this world gone wrong.  They become your friends.  It wasn't like a character in a movie just got killed, it was like, Oh, this is horrible.  It had the most intense character study of almost any pure genre movie.  Even the zombies had personalities."<br /><br />Right on, Quentin.  I couldn't agree with you more.  A horror fan???  Ya' gotta see it!  10 is written all over it.  And, like I said, trust me.  I've seen them all and this one honestly scared (...)me.</p></body></html>

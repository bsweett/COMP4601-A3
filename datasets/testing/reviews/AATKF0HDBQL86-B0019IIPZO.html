<meta name="summary" content="I want more Diesel, please"></head><body><p>I've been hearing lots of comments about this movie from friends of mine, so I finally decided to buy it.  Lemme tell ya, it was worth every penny!  Vin Diesel was absolutely wonderful as Riddick, the convicted murderer whose ability to see the planet's indigenous, man-eating lifeforms proves to be most helpful in getting the crash survivors around in the dark, and Radha Mitchell was great as Caroline, the surviving officer of the crashed ship ... Riddick .. escapes with (the) survivors.  It was also wonderful to see Keith David of Armageddon fame as the Muslim holy man.  I only wish he'd had a bigger role!<p>My only real gripe with Pitch Black (and one, I am sure, that is shared by lots of others everywhere) was the fact that the character played by Farscape's Claudia Black was 86'ed barely halfway through the film.  She was a real tough cookie who seemed to know what she was doing, and it just seemed so senseless that she got offed so early.  Except for that little blunder, I found Pitch Black to be very entertaining, and the behind the scenes documentary to be very informative.</p></body></html>

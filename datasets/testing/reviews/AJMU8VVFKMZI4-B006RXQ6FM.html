(I didn't care for her musical)  This is a slow, character driven piece that I was totally head faked into believing that Streep was the unreasonable one.  I agree with one reviewer that there are no real good characters here--except perhaps for the little boy.  But then again, we see nothing through his eyes.  I like Amy Adams but she felt more like wallpaper in this piece.  To me, Hoffman didn't bring his A game--but Meryl is the master of the game.  It's a good solid movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rule #115: Never walk away in a funny jacket!"></head><body><p>Wedding Crashers is an instant comedy classic. It is surprising that director David Dobkin hasn't done more. There was Clay Pigeons, with Vince Vaughn, but as a psycho, not a comedy. He worked with Owen Wilson on Shanghai Knights, but his resume is otherwise thin. Why hasn't Dobkin made more comedies? It is really remarkable. The chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson is like it was between Vaughn and Jon Favreau in Swingers, because first and foremost, this is a buddy picture.<br /><br />---------------<br />Jeremy Grey: John? I need to see you right away. It's important.<br />John Beckwith: [Walking into Jeremy's office] What's going on?<br />Jeremy Grey: [sighs] We got three big weeks ahead of us. It's wedding season, kid!<br />John Beckwith: You sandbaggin' son of a *****!<br />Jeremy Grey: I've got us down for 17 of them already.<br />John Beckwith: Okay, now how many of them have cash bars?<br />Jeremy Grey: Great question. I like where your head's at and two of them actually are, but I got us covered: Purple hearts. We won't have to pay for a drink all night.<br />John Beckwith: Oh, yeah. Perfect.<br />Jeremy Grey: We are gonna have tons and tons of opportunities to meet gorgeous ladies that get so aroused by the thought of marriage that they'll throw their inhibitions to the wind.<br />John Beckwith: And who's gonna be there to catch them?<br />Jeremy Grey: Grab that net and catch that beautiful butterfly, pal! What do you like better, Christmas or Wedding Season?<br />[Jeremy raises his hand]<br />John Beckwith: Mr. Grey?<br />Jeremy Grey: Yes. The answer would be, um, Wedding Season?<br />[shimmy-shakes]<br />John Beckwith: Bingo! I'm gonna get my suit. Now who are we this time?<br />=====================================================<br /><br />But it is also a great romantic comedy, and Isla Fisher and Rachel McAdams are gorgeous and fantastic--also great chemistry with Vince and Owen, respectively. Finally, it is a coming of age story where a lesson is learned about the value of commitment, but marriage doesn't have to mean the end of fun.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Jeremy Grey: Gloria, I've been doing a lot of soul searching recently, and I think I'm ready to take this relationship, our relationship to the next level.<br />Gloria Cleary: Jeremy, I am so ready to take it to the next level.<br />Jeremy Grey: Really?<br />Gloria Cleary: Yeah. Do you want to watch me with another girl? How about those Brazilian twins we met at the ball game?<br />Jeremy Grey: I was thinking more along the lines of an engagement.<br />Gloria Cleary: Oh Jeremy, I do!<br />Jeremy Grey: I love you.<br />Gloria Cleary: I love you.<br />==============================================<br /><br />So, it is like having your wedding cake and eating it, too. This movie has something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, and a six pence in her shoe--succeeding on so many levels, as buddy picture, romance, and coming of age; but mainly, it is always funny, no matter what level it is currently succeeding on.<br /><br />---------------<br />Claire Cleary: What is true love?<br />John Beckwith: True love is your soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another.<br />Claire Cleary: It's a little cheesy but I like it.<br />John Beckwith: I read it on a bumper sticker!<br />============================<br /><br />Plus, the best wedding disruption since 'The Graduate.'<br /><br />-------------------<br />Jeremy Grey: Do you know what that awareness is, Gloria?<br />Gloria Cleary: What?<br />Jeremy Grey: That we're all one. That separateness is an illusion, and that I'm one with everyone - with the Prime Minister of England, and my cousin Harry, you and me, the fat kid from 'What's Happening,' the Olsen twins, Natalie Portman, the guy who wrote 'Catcher in the Rye,' Nat King Cole, Carrot Top, Jay-Z, Weird Al Yankovic, Harry Potter, if he existed, the whore on the street corner, your mother. We're all one.<br />========================================<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141687">The Cable Guy (Full Screen)</a> (1996) ....

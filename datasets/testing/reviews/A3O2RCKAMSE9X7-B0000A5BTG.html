<meta name="summary" content="CORE: Isaac Asimov Meets Jules Verne"></head><body><p>The advance reviews of Jon Amiel's CORE were terrible so I had rather low expectations that ranged from special effects, to dialogue, to plausibility.  I was pleasantly surprised that CORE delivered in the critical areas that a disaster movie is supposed to.  The opening scene of birds flying amuck brought back some twitching memories of Daphne Dumorier's THE BIRDS.  Other vignettes of geological and meteorological minor catastrophes well prepared me for the initial premise that would destroy the earth: that the spinning core of the planet's molten center had--well--stopped spinning, thus destabilizing the earth's magnetic fields and exposing humanity to the full force of incoming cosmic radiation.  Now, even though I had no previous awareness that the core rotates, I could accept that it might stop.  The so-called cheesy special effects were not cheesy at all.  The lightning bolts ripping apart the Colloseum in Rome looked real enough. Further, the images seen through the drill ship's camera of the earth's core reminded me in a wacky way of the sights and sounds experienced by James Mason and Pat Boone as they also headed down towards the center of the earth in the film of the same name.  Having a lovely female terranaut-scientist aboard brough back an image of Raquel Welch from FANTASTIC VOYAGE.  To carp over the unlikelihood of humanity's being able to build a drill ship in three months is to miss the point.  As the terranauts drilled their way down to the core to restart its rotation, I found that I actually cared about their collective fates.  The ability of the audience to do that is what separates impure dreck from its more pure cousin that CORE certainly is.  CORE is not a great movie, nor is it even a very good one, but is is good enough to be the latest update of a colorized 1950s B movie about the end of this world.</p></body></html>

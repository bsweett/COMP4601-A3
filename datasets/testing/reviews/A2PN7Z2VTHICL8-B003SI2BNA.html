<meta name="summary" content="There is always something gross about filthy water in unexpected places"></head><body><p>When beautiful Dahlia (Jennifer Connolly) goes through an ugly divorce and custody battle with ex-husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) over their daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade), she decides to move to Roosevelt Island in order to live closer to the best school for their daughter.  Kyle doesn't care for Dahlia's decision but is unable to stop her from moving into a horrid and weirdly disturbing rent-controlled apartment complex, sprawling and psychologically dark.<br /><br />John C. Reilly plays landlord Mr. Murray, an overzealous and officious man who prefers to avoid problems with the large complex once pushing the hard sell to its tenants.  He repeatedly passes off Dahlia's problems to the building's super, Mr. Veeck (played by Pete Postlehwaite), a cantankerous old man without an ounce of friendliness and more than a little odd.<br /><br />In Dahlia's tiny, dilapidated apartment, in spite of recent paint and both Veeck and Murray's promise of considerable work done, the ceiling in the bedroom begins leaking dark and murky water.  Veeck blames it on two juvenile delinquents who break into the empty apartment above and vandalize it.  Then Ceci's new teacher (played by Camryn Manheim) informs Dahlia that Ceci has an 'imaginary friend' and is becoming antisocial within the classroom.<br /><br />Ceci's behavior inside the darkly unsettling complex becomes more and more bizarre, leading Dahlia to discover an unlocked door to a roof without a railing and a rusted water tower menacing the filthy rooftop.  Dahlia starts to wonder why she is having dark dreams, dreams of her own childhood, and why Ceci is infatuated with 'Nastasha', the girl who lives upstairs.<br /><br />But the apartment upstairs is empty and flooded with gruesomely fetid water, the same water leaking into Dahlia's apartment, so Dahlia forces Veeck to tell her the truth about the absent family from above.<br /><br />'Dark Water' is a very good psychological thriller.  The performances of Jennifer Connolly and Dougray Scott (two of my favorites), along with Pete Postlethwaite, Camryn Manheim, and John C. Reilly are exceptional, their talents bringing justice to the dilapidated and unforgiving eeriness of the apartment complex.<br /><br />The nastiness of the unclean water is presented so expertly that I could actually smell its foulness.  Dahlia's slide into depression and anxiety is very well portrayed as she questions her own sanity in the mess that has enveloped her and Ceci's lives.  The overall creepiness of this movie definitely deserves five stars, along with the photography, script, editing, and director Walter Salles.<br /><br />'Dark Water' is not the fast paced gore-fest us horror aficionado's enjoy, but the stealthy and creeping terror of unstable minds, decrepit architecture, a slow slide into madness, and the unworldly forces of the dead pushing their way into our lives.  A nice surprise awaits you at the film's conclusion, also.  I definitely believe this movie is worth a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Special Effects!"></head><body><p>I liked most of this movie, especially the special effects, but the ending is too abrupt and the story is never resolved.  I like movies where the author tells you the ending.  It bothers me when I have to figure it out.<br /><br />Cage is ok in his role but not quite as good as he was in National Treasure.  His relationship with Jennifer Beals character seemed forced and not real.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is excellent as a Secret Service agent tying to enlist Cage's ability to see into the future so that she can prevent an atomic bomb from destroying Los Angeles.<br /><br />It could have been a lot better.</p></body></html>

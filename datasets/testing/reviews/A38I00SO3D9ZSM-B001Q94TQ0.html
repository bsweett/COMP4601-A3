<meta name="summary" content="Captivating"></head><body><p>It's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Catalina Sandino Moreno.  Though beautiful, it's her performance, not her looks, that captivates.  You feel the indignities and frustrations of Maria's life.  Her desperation, which drives her to a near-tragic end, is palpable.<br /><br />Lots of movies have glorified (for lack of a better word) drug dealers and the drug trade (think: Blow, Scarface.)  Maria Full of Grace, quite beautifully, shows the conditions which drive otherwise good people into that lucrative "business."  This film moves steadily but hardly at a breakneck pace; yet, it is intense and keeps its viewers glued to the screen.<br /><br />Maria Full of Grace is one of the best movies I've seen in the last few years.  Everything about it -- acting, script, cinematography -- is great.</p></body></html>

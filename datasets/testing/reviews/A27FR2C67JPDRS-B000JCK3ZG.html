<meta name="summary" content="The Mutants Take a Stand! (SPOILER ALERT)"></head><body><p>....And the summer movie season is off!!!  X-Men: The Last Stand is the first REAL blockbuster of the year and a great action film!  The third installment of this X-Men franchise brings us the appearance of new characters, old ones and a the transformation of Jean Grey into the Phoenix, all in one movie.<br /><br />The plot involves humans discovering a "cure" for those who wish to be rid of their mutant powers and blend into society.  While both sets of mutants, led by Professor Xavier and Magneto, respectively, do not agree with a cure, the two take different view points on how to deal with the situation.  Magneto decides it is time for the mutants to stand up to the unevolved humans who are trying to erradicate anyone with mutant powers.  Xavier's X-Men knows it is up to them to stop their evil counterparts from going to war with humanity.<br /><br />This film marks a huge change in the franchise.  There is the death of THREE major characters, major characters lose their powers to the "cure" and there are changes in leadership at Xavier's school.  Magneto's Brotherhood is also affected, left in shambles by the end of the movie.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the film, I do have some small complaints.  I'd liked to have seen the director do more with Angel.  He was pretty much left with nothing to do.  To be honest, I would loved to have seen the Phoenix hang around for another film.  The Phoenix is such an interesting and complex character, I think we could have benefited from another appearance in the franchise.<br /><br />As for compliments, I really enjoyed Kelsey Grammer as Beast. I really hope we see more of him in the next film. I think the director did a good job of keeping the story fast moving and giving the fans a lot of action.  And the ending pretty much shows us that things are not over.  I, for one, am looking forward to the revamped mutants and the next challenge they will face.  Worth your money and highly recommended!<br /><br />(I just edited my review to encourage movie fans to stay until the end of the credits.  I just found out there is a secret scene at the end of the credits!)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fun to watch!  Kate Beckinsale can act and move!"></head><body><p>I say this is an excellent sequel that compliments the first film quite well.  I believe the films are equal in storyline, but the second film seems to have cooler sets and special effects.<br /><br />My one complaint about this film is that it verbally tells you what is happening just a little too much.  Although I enjoy Beckinsale's voice and accent as she tells us about her journey, I was waiting for her to even tell me how many bullets she had left in her gun.<br /><br />However, that minor flaw does not take away that this is a great action film.<br /><br />Some people have commented that this movie fails to deliver what the first movie did, but I don't think that's a fair statement, as we had the element of surprise in the first one.  This film was more of a bad guy chasing after the good guys adventure.  And when one looks at it from that perspective, the movie is really quite good.<br /><br />Give this movie a viewing.  I think you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />It delivers action, drama, romance, suspense, and a little bit of gore.  What more do you want from a film called Underworld?<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is very brutal"></head><body><p>Whether you saw the theatrical or director's cut, unless you're a die-hard Rob Zombie fan, (and I'm not!)this film is not owner's material.<br />The language is way too constant, and the violence is needlessly graphic.<br />If John Carpenter really wanted his film re-made, he should've done it himself, or gotten any other director to do it, besides Rob Zombie, he doesn't have the slightest idea what he's doing and should continue writing music, and retire from directing.<br />I give this film 3 stars for two reasons: Malcolm McDowell and the explanation for what made Michael go nuts, this is rent-material only.</p></body></html>

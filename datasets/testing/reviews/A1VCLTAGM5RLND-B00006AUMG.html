When it comes to kill the mutant creature that came from another vampire he is the man to do the job. When he needs the blood he jumps in and start kicking butt. I recommend that all people own this movie and watch it everyday for the rest of your lives and live by it. It is the best movie of all time to where I would make it my last wish to see Wesley Snipes in full costume.</p></body></html>

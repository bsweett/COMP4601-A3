<meta name="summary" content="Totally weird - but in a great way @}->---"></head><body><p>This is a cute, romantic and dramatic movie that is really unusal but done very well.  I love the Sandra and Keanu combination.  They click really well and the chemistry between them is like a Meg and Tom chemistry - they belong together on the screen.<br /><br />Some parts of this are predictable, and some will leave you with your jaw wide open when you see it all unfold.  It's a great and cute story that is probably more of a chick flick than anything else.  I thought the special effects were good (especially when they were both in the park) and while at first you might be confused and frustrated by not understanding where it is going - be patient because when it all comes together, you'll realise that it was worth the ride.  Really well done and a new fast favourite of mine.  Enjoy.</p></body></html>

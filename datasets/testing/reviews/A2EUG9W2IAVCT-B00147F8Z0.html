<meta name="summary" content="Big disappointment"></head><body><p>I know lots of people thought the first movie in this series (Alien vs. Predator) had a lot lacking, but I still ended up enjoying it.  Sure, it couldn't compare to the first Alien or Aliens by any means, but it held some merit nonetheless.  But this film is a complete horror to a decent predecessor.  The story line lacks direction and it appears that the director just chose to include as much horror as possible to shock value.  So while it may have some moments, this is one movie you can avoid.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="About Men & Bugs."></head><body><p>Paul Verhoeven has become a very successful sci-fi film director after he moved to America. "Robocop" (1987), "Total Recall" (1990), "Starship Troopers" (1997) and "The Hollow Man" (2000) are there to testify this.<br /><br />The present film is not "just" a sci-fi movie, even if it is a very good one for the genre and sci-fi lovers will enjoy it very much (as I did).<br />The approach chosen by Verhoeven is that of a caricature of an authoritarian Human society fighting an annihilation war against Bugs.<br />Aren't Bugs the perfect Enemy? YES, they may be exterminated, desecrated, demonized, whatever WITHOUT remorse.<br />But the not na?ve viewer will bear in mind that in every major armed conflict  the "enemy" will be metamorphosed little by little into a Bug.<br />At the same time the Human's military wardrobe is highly reminiscent of nazi uniforms.<br /><br />I have read Heinlein's book but I will not compare the text with the movie. After reviewing movies for a while, is my conviction that they are a "kind" of art products that should stand by themselves, detached from their literary origin.<br /><br />Aside from Verhoeven's approach, this is a very good sci-fi action film with great special effects and relentless rhythm.<br />The cast delivers fairly good acting pieces. Actors: Casper Van Dien as Rico, Neil P. Harris as Jenkins, Clancy Brown as Sergeant Zim (over par), Jake Busey as Levy and Michael Ironside as a perfect Lt. Rasczak.<br />Actress: Dina Mayer as Dizzy Flores very dynamic, athletic & sensual at the same time; Denise Richards as Carmen Ibanez is just lovely.<br />In supporting roles many good parts are delivered also.<br /><br />Jost Vacano is the usual filmography director that collaborates with Verhoeven and they team well.<br /><br />It is a good yet violent film. Sci-fi fans shouldn't miss it!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

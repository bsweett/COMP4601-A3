He succeeded brilliantly on both counts, with cinematography that captures both the mystery and harshness of the desert, Maurice Jarre's haunting score, action scenes that are riveting, and performances that are all first-rate, headed by Omar Sharif's charismatic Ali, and, in the title role, Peter O'Toole as the enigmatic title character.<br /><br />Lawrence remains a controversial figure to this day, a man of incredible abilities, yet devastating character flaws that would, in time, destroy both his credibility and his reputation. O'Toole's sensitive interpretation of the man is simply brilliant, balancing a larger-than-life ego and bravado with a confusion of who he really is, and a growing moral corruption that would eventually bring about his downfall.<br /><br />An amazing film, truly David Lean's masterpiece!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ABSORBING, BUT..."></head><body><p>Frank Darabont knows his way around a prison -- he gets the look, feel, atmosphere and assorted characters dead on.  The Green Mile, again an adaptaton of a Stephen King story, does not disappoint when it comes to  evoking this world.  But, unlike the far superior Shawshank Redemption,  this movie has, for me, an alienating dose of the supernatural, like Carrie  in prison.  The human scenes and characters, Tom Hanks chief among them,  are so compelling without this extra layer, I cannot help but feel that  this movie would have been even more powerful without resorting to the  special effect moments of strangeness.  It is also bloated in its running  time, as if the story was so important that it required three hours to  tell; the narrative simply doesn't warrant it. However, these flaws  notwithstanding, Michael Duncan is riveting; Bonnie Hunt again delivers a  subtle, warm performance as Hanks' wife; the villianous types are villians  extraordinaire, and the movie is completely enjoyable on its own terms.  A  fantasy portending to be something much deeper, The Green Mile is superbly  packaged pulp, designed, it seems, for a younger audience, with excellent  performances and production values.</p></body></html>

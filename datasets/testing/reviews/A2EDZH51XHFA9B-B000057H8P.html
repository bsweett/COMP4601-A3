<meta name="summary" content="I've been watching the wrong musicals."></head><body><p>Singin' in the Rain (Stanley Donen, 1952)<br /><br />I have long held to a belief that Fiddler on the Roof was the only decent movie musical ever made (unless you want to count Pink Floyd: The Wall as a movie musical and not a long-form video, or The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which I guess is more a musical than anything). I have now come to understand that I've just been watching the wrong movie musicals, because Singin' in the Rain is about as delightful as they come.<br /><br />Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) comes to Hollywood looking to make it big in the movies. He quickly hooks up with composer (and funnyman) Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor, who comes perilously close to stealing the movie), and together, the two of them make great silent films with Lockwood's ultra-popular, but shrewish behind the screen, leading lady, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). Lockwood, meanwhile, has met someone he actually likes, a dancing girl with a marvelous voice named Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). The voice comes into play with the advent of talkies; Lina Lamont has a voice to match her personality. What to do?<br /><br />I've been (no pun intended) dancing around this review for weeks now because I just don't know what to say about this movie. It's just out-and-out wonderful. Even if you think you don't like musicals, give it a shot; the music is much better-integrated here than it is in most musicals I've had the misfortune to come across, and of course the dancing is first-rate. This ain't world-famous for nothing. **** ?</p></body></html>

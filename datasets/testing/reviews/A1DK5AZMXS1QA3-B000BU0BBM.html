Once you understand and accept this fact of life, then you realize how good a movie this really is.  The storyline is simple; the two Grimm brothers (Damon and Ledger) are traveling con men in Napeolonic Europe.  They use their knowledge of optics, chemistry, physics and psychology to create apparitions in isolated villages, and then appear to save the villagers from these demons.  The local French ruler (Price) uncovers their ruse and sends them on a mission to solve a real mystery in a German village.  They, of course do, and proceed to become local heroes.<br /><br />There are numerous aspects of this film that are quite impressive and admirable.  First of, this is one of the few films to accurately portray European village life before the Industrial Revolution.  The roads are muddy, the people and their clothes are dirty as daily bathing is unknown, bad hygiene (missing teeth, etc...) is universal, superstition is ingrained in daily thoughts and speech, and children of both genders often wear the same clothes.  None of the Musketeer films have done such a good job of portraying rural Europe circa 1800.<br /><br />Second, the action scenes are deliberate and integral to the story.  There are no grand war scenes, nor eye-catching CGI.  Every action scene progresses the story in some way or another, and each is innovative.  A good example is when the farmer's horse swallows his daughter.<br /><br />Third, the casting was quite good.  Lena Headey was perfect in her role as the village outcast.  She was attractive, but not too much as to cast doubt on the validity of her role as village outcast.  The choice of Monical Belluci as the Mirror Queen was also great.  She is very attractive, but for a queen who is centuries old, Belluci's natural age was a good fit.  And Peter Stormare does quite well as local henchman.<br /><br />I saw this movie twice; once at the theater and once on DVD.  The DVD viewing is much better because I could read the subtitles.  Terry Gilliam made this movie so authentic that a lot of the dialogue includes strong accents that can be lost in a movie theater, but which is captured with subtitles.</p></body></html>

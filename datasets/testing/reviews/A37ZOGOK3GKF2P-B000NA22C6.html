It is a shame to see good actors in a very predictable plot.  Not much suprise here.  In the first 10 minutes you will figure out this "gimmicky" movie.  I'm really tired of these gimmicky movies.  What ever happened to straight out suspense and drama, well written thrillers with tight direction?  This is slickly produced, looks real good.  Eye candy as it were.  Nothing much else, a real disappointment to say the least.  You'll get more suspense from a Pay-Less Shoe Store sale.</p></body></html>

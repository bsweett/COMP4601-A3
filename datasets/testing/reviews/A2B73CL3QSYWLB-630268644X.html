<meta name="summary" content="Smashing Debut For Tarantino"></head><body><p>In contrast to Quentin Tarantino's more polished and more elaborate later work, "Reservoir Dogs" pales in comparison.  This is ultimately an unfair criticism because this is the debut of a director getting his feet wet and he had limited resources at his disposal(a budget under one-million dollars).  Considering that, this film is a smashing success.  The dialogue that Tarantino has written for his characters is priceless, the tension he ratcheted up is palpable, and the performances he's gotten from his actors is top-notch.  I cannot cite one performance here from a single actor that is better or worse than another.  They work as a true ensemble, like an efficient machine.  This DVD is loaded with good extras, my favorite being a remembrance of Lawrence Tierney who played Joe in the film.  Tierney was a real character and it is lovingly related in this tribute.  My least favorite are the sections where Tarantino talks (and talks) about the movie.  Tarantino is an interesting person but not everything he says is a pearl of wisdom.  He should employ his editor, Sally Menke, whenever he has a sitdown interview.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Half Good, Half Bad"></head><body><p>It started off really interesting in an American Psycho kind of way, but then it just seemed like everyone was or wanted to be a killer.<br /><br />I must say that Kevin Costner and William Hurt put on a very good show. Demi Moore and Dane Cook are simply miscast in my opinion. Danielle Panabaker plays the same character she does on the television show Shark, but she is cute as a button, so she has that going for her. Mr. Brooks never really bored me, but some of the dialogue and situations seemed too unrealistic. The hallway shootout towards the end is a fine example of this. When did Demi enter the Matrix? You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad film, but one to wait for on DVD.</p></body></html>

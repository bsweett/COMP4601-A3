<meta name="summary" content="Marvel made another good comic book film"></head><body><p>Daredevil is by no means a perfect film but when it comes to eye candy films I take them for what they are which is eye candy. Ben Affleck plays Matt/DD very well he actually surpised me with his performance. The film has a dark tone and isn't all colorful like Spider Man was. Colin Farrel and Micheal Clarke Duncan as the villians do good jobs but Colin steals the show as Bullseye. In my opinion Farrel did one of best comic book villain jobs since Jack as The Joker. When it comes to Jenifer Garner as Elerkta she did a good job she's sexy as always. My only complaint with the film was I feel it needed more action but I'm guessing since this wasn't a hit then we won't get sequel with loads of action. It's a fun film just don't take it seriously.</p></body></html>

But what would you expect?<br /><br />As most people would know, "Thirteen" is the third part of what is becoming a series around the antics of Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his team of Hollywood buddies.  The plot is inconceivable in any realistic sense but who really cares?  This is a movie about characters and the fun they get up to.  No one would seriously expect anything more.  So long as you have this mindset, "Thirteen" offers a couple of hours of good escapism.</p></body></html>

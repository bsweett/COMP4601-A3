<meta name="summary" content="I'll be back"></head><body><p>The phrase "I'll be back" conjures up pretty much one image in today's world; yes that of the first of the Terminator series of movies.<br /><br />Night time, wind and electricity swirl around and the appetence of a naked Anry (Arnold Schwarzenegger.) Frightening in its self but only a taste of what is to come. It seems that he is invincible and is targeting all the Sara Connors in the phone book. Each one being dispatched more violently than the last. A less robust being (Michael Biehn) also appears the same way. He too is seeking Sara.<br /><br />What is so intriguing about Sara Connors (Linda Hamilton)?<br /><br />Who will find her first?<br /><br />What effect can the outcome have on humankind?<br /><br />I thought Arnold's accent added to the character of the movie. It is the way one says "I'll be back" that adds the threat.</p></body></html>

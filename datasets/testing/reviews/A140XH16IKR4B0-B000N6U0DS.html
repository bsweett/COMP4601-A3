<meta name="summary" content="Too many setbacks, too small a dream"></head><body><p>"The Pursuit of Happiness" tells the story of Chris Gardner (Will Smith), a lower middle class black man whose dream of prosperity is evaporating. He and his wife invested heavily in a portable bone densitometer, but sales are horrible and the family is just a step ahead of eviction. Slowly but surely, Chris loses nearly everything, until he is left almost literally with nothing but his young son (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) and the clothes on his back. By luck, he connects with a group of E.F. Hutton employees and starts a long and uncertain trip out of his predicament.<br /><br />The film does a phenomenal job of communicating just how difficult it can be to rise from the margins, even if one is talented and ambitious. Gardner must feed and house his son while studying for a soul-crushing investment exam, showing up to work fresh every day and managing child care. The difficulties he faces are enormous and daunting, and would have deterred many a less hardy soul.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />But from a filmic perspective, there were problems. How many close calls can a viewer endure without getting irritated? And using the name of a real investment firm pretty much gives away the ending. Then too, there was the lack of emotional intensity between the characters, with the exception of Jaden, who was delightful and real throughout. One had to wonder as well about the likelihood that a man who washed himself in subway bathrooms could be fresh -- both mentally and aromatically - every day for months. And without once cutting corners in the childcare area.<br /><br />"Pursuit of Happiness" is a fine movie that depicts the experience of individuals who are dogged about achieving their dreams. But it does so at the cost of its own integrity, shortchanging the damage that such a pursuit, no matter how well-motivated, has on those around them. By the end of the film, I was unconvinced by Chris Gardner's sterling character and mistrustful of the depiction of his money-grubbing dream as worthy of his efforts.</p></body></html>

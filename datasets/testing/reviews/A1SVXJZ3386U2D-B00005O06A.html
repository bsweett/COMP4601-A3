When "Citizen Kane" topped the list of the 100 best American movies of all time, there were a few critics of a choice that many felt did not appeal to the majority of American movie-goers.  Fair enough although "Citizen Kane" certainly has a story that is a lot easier to follow and enjoy that most of the "artistic" movies of the last century. It does seem to slow down at times but this is one of those movies that reveals more and more about itself each time you view it.<br /><br />It is as though the puzzle of the movie is also a puzzle for the movie audience.  What did Kane mean by the dying word, "Rosebud"?  Well, everyone who saw it through to the end certainly got a big clue but did that really tell everything there is or was it just a big hint to the larger story hidden in the movie itself?  As we watch the reporter trying to find the answers, we can see inside the story to the many insights hidden throughout the film.  Every time we see it again, the picture becomes clearer.  It isn't just that Kane wanted his childhood back; in many ways he was reliving his childhood as an adult with bigger toys but just as much enthusiasm.  It isn't just that he wanted love that was real; it was clear that he was unable to handle the love he received.  It is a far more complex picture that we have before us than most of us comprehend the first time or two through the reels.  Perhaps it is best to leave it at its' simpler messages but that is to miss the appreciation for the intentional complexity given it by its' creator, Orson Welles.<br /><br />There are many examples beyond just the story itself as to why "Citizen Kane" is such a classic; the camera angles and perspectives, to name one.  However, as much as I appreciate the cinematic innovations, I am fascinated by the story and the many insights to life itself that are revealed in this classic.  This is not necessarily a movie I stop at if I come across it while changing channels.  Sometimes I'm just not up for it, preferring, instead, something lighter for my tired mind.  However, when I want to appreciate just how well all the elements of a great movies can come together in near perfection, I chose to watch "Citizen Kane".  It may have a few faults (such as who the heck was there to have heard him utter the work "Rosebud"?).  However, the faults are almost embarassing to mention compared with the magnitude of its' achievements.  This is a movie everyone should see at least twice.</p></body></html>

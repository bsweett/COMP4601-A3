If you said that, and I know I did, it is even more deserving when you watch the movie.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx gives the performance of a lifetime.  He may never get a role like this again, and if not, who cares?  He will always have this.  The story spans most of Ray Charles' life up to the point where the state of Georgia officially apologized to him for banning him from playing in their borders due to his cancellation of a huge concert because it was segregated.<br /><br />Flashing back to scenes of his childhood, he grew up in a poor working community of blacks in the south.  He took interest in piano as a small boy and was taught by a man in his neighborhood.  Moving swiftly the plot and story shows how he traveled to Seattle and made a name for himself in the blues scene. As he moved up, he encountered racism as well as discrimination for being blind.  Strangely more people seemed to shun him for his blindness rather than his race.<br /><br />As he gained more popularity he struggled to find his `sound'.  He also married and went on the road making a lot of money.  As his wife kept his home and had his children, he toured the country as he slipped deeper into drug use, infidelity and increasingly haunting memories from his childhood where he witnessed his younger brother die and his sight slowly slip away at an early age.<br /><br />The story climaxes with his own realization of what his life had become.  Despite his fame and fortune, his drug use and torturing memories were taking their toll.  Salvation comes the hard way.  Despite it's two and half hour running time, Director Taylor Hackford makes sure the movie moves at a steady pace, never getting too slow or bogging itself down in intellectual over thinking of what the character is feeling.  Emotions are displayed and expressed, giving real tangibility to the story.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx made playing the part look so easy, and his talent has surfaced as he surely will be offered more substantial roles after this.</p></body></html>

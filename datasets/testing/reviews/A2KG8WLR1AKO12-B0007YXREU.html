<meta name="summary" content="Team America to the Rescue"></head><body><p>Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park fame have put together a fantastically funny story regarding the war on terror.  Try imagining sixteen year old boys sneaking into the movie studio when their parents aren't around.  Team America is juvenile humor on steroids.  Our heroes are out to save the world from militant Muslims and the Communist terror of Kim Jong Il---and the naive actors like Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin, and Helen Hunt who stand in their way.  The terror masters manipulate the Hollywood crowd to unwittingly further their evil plans.  And no, this film is not even slightly politically correct.  Everyone may be offended.  Both the religious right and the goofy left will find things to appall them.  The vulgar language and wild sex scenes (yes Virginia, puppets do indeed enjoy sex!) will definitely get your attention.<br /><br />Team America's irreverent and insightful look at today's terrorist threat makes it well worth your time.  Ultimately, it not too subtly argues that the terrorists must be opposed by violence.  Pacifism will only render us vulnerable.  Our enemies primarily respond only to a serious booty kicking.  It's a message that needs to be heeded.  Are you too late to see Team America at your local theater?  In that case, you should purchase the dvd version.</p></body></html>

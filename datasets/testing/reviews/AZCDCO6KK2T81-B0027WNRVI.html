<meta name="summary" content="Van Helsing is a fun, tongue-in-cheek, salute to the horror films of the 50's and 60's."></head><body><p>This film is a throwback to those old 50's horror films that had classic monsters doing battle with each other coupled with the wit of the 60's era all combined with the thrills and special effects of today's films.<br /><br />Entertainment rarely gets better than this.  Now stop laughing at my five stars for this kind of film.  This isn't the five stars you would give a film like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079284646X">Platoon</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOIX48">The Painted Veil</a>.  It's more like the five stars you would you give a film like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILDE">Aliens</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Die Hard</a>.  This is fun, thrilling, and engaging entertainment.  It's simple popcorn fun that the whole family, for the most part, can enjoy.  The CGI can be a little over-the-top, but it is still excellently done and doesn't get in the way of the story.<br /><br />The film has engaging actors who, while playing their roles with some seriousness, you can tell that it is all tongue-in-cheek and one expects them to wink at the camera at any time.  Hugh Jackman certainly carries the film with great charm and coolness that reminds one of Ford's Indiana Jones.  Kate Beckinsale is great as his reluctant partner and just looks dang sexy in this role that brings to mind her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001WTUH6">Underworld</a> character.  She just sizzles on the screen.  In addition, excellent support is rendered by David Wenham, most known for his roles in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QXDED6">300</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy</a>, Richard Roxburgh of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KLQUSU">Stealth</a>, Kevin J. O'Conner from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IONJGU">The Mummy</a>, and Robbie Coltrane who is best known as Hagrid in the Harry Potter films.<br /><br />The direction is confidently done and unobtrusive.  He combines action and horror very effectively.  The photography is appropriately creepy and atmospheric.  The set designs are elaborate and the score is compelling.  The entire film is excellently produced and is what I call a high octane film.  This film gets you running on all cylinders.  Watch it and have a blast enjoying it for the kind of entertainment it is.<br /><br />The film is thrilling and suspenseful with the various classic creature battling each other and at times forming uneasy alliances.  This is just old fashioned witty and enjoyable entertainment.  The repeat value of this film is what also makes this film worthy of a place in your DVD collection.</p></body></html>

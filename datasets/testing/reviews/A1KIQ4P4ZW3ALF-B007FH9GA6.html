Within the movie itself viewers of the original are most apt to be put off by other differences such as the  exaggerated tats, piercings and makeup as well as the exaggerated robotic emotional portrayals. The difference is analogous to seeing entertainment oriented fake wrestling vs. the real wrestling. The editing was disjointed as our characters seemed to jump from scene to scene despite the distances. The acting was a little too stiff. Lisbeth's and Mikael's computer skills seemed like what an older, computer illiterate person might engage in while doing a goog search. The sex scenes seemed to be added solely to gain market share and just didn't add to the story. Lisbeth's and Mikael's problem solving research were a far-fetched not believable. Their physical actions seemed dumb e.g. Lisbeth sneaking up on someone in loud clunking shoes on marble floors was just a "sure you are" or Mikael sneaking around and out of the house only to get caught. A "dummy" of a supposedly smart investigator. You didn't feel as if she was the one riding the motorcycle. Just a roller coaster, uneven ride of a movie.</p></body></html>

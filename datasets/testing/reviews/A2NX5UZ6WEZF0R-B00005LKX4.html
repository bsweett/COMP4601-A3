No wonder she disagreed to such a film. It's a joke my friends. It was merely violence combined with absurd ideas and stupidity. It isnt even in the same LEAGUE as LAMBS. It probably had Foster laughing that they would even have the nerve to expect a talented actreess like her to part take in such a movie. She takes her acting career seriously, and only plays roles that she as a person connects with. And a plot in a movie doesn't hurt! Red Dragon was good, only because it reflected alot of similarities with silence of the lambs. I hate it when there is such a great and unforgettable movie like LAMBS, and then comes a new film, claiming to be the third of the trilogy, but they bite off more then they can chew. Their confidence exceeded their ability as well as their underestimating LAMBS fans. Not many LAMBS fans, (who actually knew all the info about how they created such a realistic and modern suspense/thriller), would enjoy hannibal even a little. Like me.  Lambs was caviar, hannibal was cheese wizz.</p></body></html>

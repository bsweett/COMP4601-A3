Dead people are coming back to life as flesh eating zombies and no one really has any idea why. A small group of survivors, including a mall cop and a couple of news reporters, finds a refuge from the terror by boarding themselves up in a shopping mall. Zombies begin flocking to the mall in droves, but have no way of entering. Giving in to their every whim and desire, the group settles down to a fairly comfortable existence until a roving motorcycle gang finds out they have a helicopter. The motor gang has no desire to move in and live in the safety of the mall, but wants everything for their own. Their invasion of the mall brings about the film's climatic finish.<br /><br />Though the movie is fairly graphic and is a zombie flick, it's actually more of a commentary on materialism and consumerism and how it affects and infects all of us. As a commentary, the film is almost brilliant. As a zombie movie, DAWN OF THE DEAD set the bar for almost every other zombie movie to come. However, DAWN OF THE DEAD is also a movie and as a movie, it has a lot of faults. Like a Charles Dicken's novel, just about everything interesting or worthwhile that happens, occurs near the beginning and end of the movie. The middle, which should be the meat of the movie, doesn't contain much substance and the long commentary on our culture goes on too long. Nevertheless, even though the film isn't for the squeemish, DAWN OF THE DEAD is worth watching if your a fan of zombie or horror movies. Also, it's a movie that film buffs should watch just because there are very few horror films that are made that have a social context as deep as a Romero film and DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the best.</p></body></html>

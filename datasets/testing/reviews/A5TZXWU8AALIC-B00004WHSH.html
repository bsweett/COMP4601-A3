<meta name="summary" content="A Stanley Kubrick Love Story"></head><body><p>Through Stanley Kubrick's camera lens, the universe is a cold and frequently sinister place.<br /><br />The man-made world of DR. STRANGELOVE marches to its wacky Armaggeddon even as its silly characters struggle valiantly to save it.  The technology that got us into the outer space of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY betrays us and leaves us as nothing more than a well-fed, well-dressed specimen to the powers we find beyond our solar system.  The government of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is so bent on behavioral modification that it makes a hero of a rapist thug like Alex the Droog.  The mask covering our historical and psychological sins is ripped away and leaves us as absorbed ghosts in the Overlook Hotel in THE SHINING.  And the military of FULL METAL JACKET chews up our young men and spits them out as psycho-killers razing someone else's countryside.<br /><br />So at the end of his life, Kubrick makes a love story.  Talk about confounding everyone on the planet, including his fans.<br /><br />Kubrick died just after finishing the cut that was released to theatres and much speculation has been placed on what he would've done before anyone saw it.  There were enough wild rumors during production.  Even now, I read a story that Kubrick was disappointed with the Hollywood power couple of Cruise and Kidman.  (Although he's a very earnest actor, Cruise seems to struggle with depth, but I thought Kidman was a good choice...although she plays getting high on marijuana too silly and ridiculous--has she ever been high?).<br /><br />But something worked for me with EYES WIDE SHUT.<br /><br />And there's something new here that's never been seen in a Stanley Kubrick film before: optimism.  Even as Cruise's love for his wife is assaulted by the haunting images of her making love to the officer in uniform, even as he recklessly follows paths to violate his vows and his faithfulness...something always stops him.  He doesn't ravage the hooker, he doesn't indulge in the bizarre private orgy, etc.<br /><br />Something always brings him home, safe and sound.  Something you never saw in the Kubrick film before.<br /><br />(When will they release a version without the computer-generated orgy attendees blocking our view?)</p></body></html>

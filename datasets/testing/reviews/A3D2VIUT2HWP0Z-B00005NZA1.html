<meta name="summary" content="Excellent film, Tightly Packaged"></head><body><p>Immensely enjoyable, tightly presented, and even the edits are sensible.<br /><br />Usually, I find that at least some deleted scene is a studio ripout of a key scene. This was done so tightly, that it all made total sense; however, the sense also had an incredibly visceral side. The one element that sticks out in the worst possible way is the bone breaks that the baby, the child, and the adult, played by Jackson , goes through... kind of an OUUUUCH, that GOTTA  hurt, sort of feel.<br /><br />Most of the action seems to be about Willis's characters journey, however, in a very sudden twist, we discover that this is a journey of a dualistic kind.<br /><br />In many respects this is a reductionist version of a superhero style story.<br /><br />However you view it, this film will leave you with some degree of impact, and you will undoubtedly take sides. It is absolutely brilliant escapism.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></body></html>

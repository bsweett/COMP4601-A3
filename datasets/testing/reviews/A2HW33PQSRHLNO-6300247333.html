That would be a bit unrealistic. Julia Stiles is no Lee Remick, and Schreiber is certainly no Gregory Peck. Mia Farrow's role as Ms. Baylock does not come close that boorish original actress, whatever her name was. And finally, David Thewlis is no David Warner, at least not in this one. We do get some treats, actually more than a few; some of the stylistic additives the director decided to make work spectacularly, and I myself jumped at certain scenes as the other reviewer did. I liked seeing a different take on Damien as a little more threatening than Harvey Bernhard, although in the end I find this ineffectual. The scene in this film where Damien knocks Mrs. Thorn off the balcony with his bicycle is more maliciously done than in the first version. (Here Damien displays telepathic powers occasionally, too--that is how he and Ms. Baylock communicate and one of the ways that his mother ends up quite dead.)<br /><br />Whether you have seen the original film or not, some of this will be genuinely frightening--possibility for nightmare frightening. The ending was done beautifully and some of the classic scenes from the 76' version were creatively enhanced. Not really remade, just enhanced.<br /><br />Why people are complaining so much about a film that adds some innovation to a great movie while not disrespecting it by making some impossible attempt at transcending it is beyond me. (There are only adequate actors/actresses here--the resources simply weren't there. This is a good thing.  There's plenty here to enjoy. (I have to admit, though, that Mia Farrow really disappointed me: you would think a veteran-horror movie actress lik herself would have came to this determined to beat the first Ms. Baylock.)<br /><br />The director has respect for the horror genre, I think, and probably saw all the ridiculous remakes of decent ("When A Stranger Calls", etc) horror films and was unwilling to do that with "The Omen". God Bless him, no pun intended! Worth buying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WATCHMEN..."NEVER COMPROMISES" Faithful Adaptation...great movie!"></head><body><p>1st: WATCHMEN is an amazing film adaptation of an amazing graphic novel and you need to see it ( and read it)...<br /><br />2nd : Neither the film nor the graphic novel is for kids...this ain't the Incredibles (although there are obvious intention parallels on Pixar's part). WATCHMEN is rated R for sex, intense violence and big blue full frontal from the only true super-powered super hero in the mix, Dr. Manhattan. This is actually fairly distracting in IMAX,  but props to the director for refusing to put pants on the guy (yes he does wear pants at some point but this part is true the comic).<br /><br />If you've never heard of the WATCHMEN now is a good time to learn.... Comic book fans, like myself have been waiting over 20 years for the big screen live action version...Alan Moore's 12 part comic mini-series which coined the term "Graphic Novel" and established the genre's ability to aspire to the ranks of literature (Time Magazine ranked it in the 100 greatest novels of the 20th century 1923-2005)...set in the year it was published WATCHMEN tells the story of cold war era world with masked heroes (forced into retirement) who are being killed off. More importantly the story centers on the deconstruction of the "super hero" exploring the flawed heroes of two generations of vigilantes. In addition to having lots of costumed heroes around History is different is that President Nixon is still president, currently serving his 5th term thanks to have won Vietnam, using the god-like power of Dr. Manhattan. In fact Dr. M's power is the only thing keeping the super-powers in check, but nuclear war still seems inevitable.<br />In less than typical fashion, hero origins and backstories are told throughout the movie through flashbacks, some more brutal than others. Although WATCHMEN was a DC comic it isn't set in the DC Universe of Superman and Batman.<br /><br />But you can tell your players without a  program...The next generation of heroes following in the footsteps of their post-WW II predecessors the MINUTEMEN are...<br /><br />The NITE OWL II aka Dan Dreilberg, the Batman like hero desperate to get back in action in his the Owl-looking air-vehicle, Dan is probably most heroic and the least flawed of all the characters.<br /><br />The SILK SPECTRE aka Laurie Juspeczyk, her mother was one of the original Minutemen and Laurie inheirents the role. Gets involved with Dr. M and the Nite Owl.<br /><br />RORSCHACH  aka Walter Kovacs, kind of a hard-boiled-detective-with-a-grappling-hook, Rorschach is trying to catch the "Mask Murder" and probably has more problems than any other character in the story, the villains included.<br /><br />DOCTOR MANHATTAN aka Jon Osterman, the result of an "accident in the lab" Dr. M is the only super-powered character and is blue.<br /><br />OZYMANDIAS aka Adrian Veidt is the self-styled world's smartest/fittest man. Veidt fancies himself akin to Alexander the Great and is the only hero with the wherewithal to create his OWN action figure line.<br />The COMEDIAN aka Edward Blake is the murder victim of the "Mask Killer" and ex-owner of the iconic-bloody-smiley. Blake is a mercenary feared by the bad guys as well as the good guys. Imagine a sadistic, over-sexed Capt. America.<br /><br />It has nearly panel per panel recreated the original comic composition of Moore's artist co-creator Dave Gibbons.... the dialogue is almost identical and very few edits were made (biggest cut was the comic-within-the-comic "the Black Freighter" which was animated to be released later in full (it is likely that the film pacing is better for the cut). The casting is perfect and thankfully mostly low profile "unknown" actors.  The costuming and effects are equally incredible. The art direction, from Alex McDowell and Francois Auduoy,  is on a scale of it's own, with attention to detail that is overwhelmingly accurate to the backstory and lesser details of the graphic novel.<br /><br />A great and complex look at "super-heroes." Like the graphic novel, WATCHMEN the movie, truly explores the highs and lows of the human experience, with or without capes, Moore's words are still powerful and with a running time of under 3 hours, I say, why so short?</p></body></html>

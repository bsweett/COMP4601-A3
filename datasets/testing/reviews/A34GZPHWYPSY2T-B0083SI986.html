For the interested dvd-buyer, I have a few words. Also, I wish to speak to the cinematic merit of this film.<br /><br />Being an Eastwood fan since "Paint Your Wagon", and a veteran watcher of his spaghetti Westerns, Eastwood can do no wrong by me. As a director/producer, his seminal work on jazz musician Thelonious Monk in "Straight, No Chaser" will stand as hugely in the future as "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil".<br /><br />"Gran Torino", in my view, does not meet the standards of the two abovementioned films. In the still-lambent light of "Million Dollar Baby", it is a rather trivial little thing. What strikes me most is that you will love this beginning to end if you love Eastwood; otherwise you might think you just been had by yet another overblown after-school-special-type flick.<br /><br />Still, I have to admit no one could do this sort of thing except Eastwood. No one would have the balls, no one would have the talent or the know-how. This brings me to ask, "Why didn't Eastwood make this film better?"<br /><br />I know there are intense comments in other reviews about how great this is as a statement about racism...somehow I wonder if Eastwood really meant it exactly that way. After all, the story IS about him, a crusty, nasty old Korean War vet with a big guilt complex about "killing gooks". It is always all about him. Perhaps this film is more geared toward the way we change our prejudices. I know the character reminded me of myself--perhaps that's why I'm one of the few who's NOT raving about the movie.<br /><br />Take this review as-is. It isn't in my purview to tell you to avoid the film: I say buy it and watch it 100 times--Eastwood deserves that much, and it is worth watching at the end of the day. Cinematically, it's as perfect as one can get: the cinematography is gorgeous considering the setting. Finally, I'd take a cue from this movie and study up on the Hmong Tribe, very important real-life people living in this country.</p></body></html>

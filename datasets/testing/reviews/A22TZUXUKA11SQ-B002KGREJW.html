It's a story about a typical suburban family focuses on a little girl who dreams of success in beauty pageants.  Olive, age 7, has nothing else really going for her besides her ambition.  She enters numerous contests with the dream of taking home the crown, even placing second in the Little Miss Sunshine competition.  Her mother, played by Toni Collette is the complete opposite of a stage mom.  She is encouraging to the point of being nauseous--even when the audience knows her daughter doesn't stand a chance.  Olive's father, Greg Kinnear, instead usurps the role of stage mom letting Olive know that if she even dares to eat a bowl of ice cream she might wind up fat. The cast of Little Miss Sunshine is rounded out by Steve Carell at his humorous peak as the sarcastic, suicidal gay uncle, Alan Arkin as the porn-obsessed grandfather who gives Olive hope, and Paul Dano as her introspective older brother who can't even be bothered to speak.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is a movie for families--not in the traditional sense, but anyone who can understand that any of the National Lampoon's Vacations--and I mean the early ones with Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase--are family films will certainly get this one.  It's the family comedy in the way that they don't make them anymore.  Dysfunctional, sarcastic, hilarious.  If you go into it with an open mind, then I'm positive you will enjoy this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HEY BUB! WHAT WOLVERINE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 3 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>Having known Wolverine since his first appearance in The Incredible Hulk issue #181, which I bought at my local magazine store for 25 cents! I know official issue #180 is the first appearance, but one panel hardly counts as an appearance. 'X-Men Origins Wolverine' is bound to raise a few eyebrows on hard core fans because of the reworking of the original story. Origins are tough with super heroes because they try to squeeze 20 to 80 years of hero history into a film that runs two hours or less.<br /><br />I enjoyed Wolverine for the most part, but I was confused at times not knowing some of the heroes from their comic counter parts on screen. The action sequences are very cool and the story moves along smoothly for the most part, but in the end it seemed like it could have been better. It's not the worst super hero film, but it's not the best either. I liked the X-Men movies, but none of them are as well thought out as any on the Spider-Man films...yes including Spider-Man 3!<br /><br />The single disc edition has the movie and some trailers so for fans of the character I think you might want to buy the two discs edition. The DVD transfer looks very good!</p></body></html>

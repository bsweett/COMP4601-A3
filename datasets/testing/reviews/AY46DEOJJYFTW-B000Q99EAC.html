<meta name="summary" content="yo Rocky!"></head><body><p>being a big fan of Rocky and subsequently turned off by all the sequels I was a bit skeptical of this one when I first heard it was being made. I even kept putting off watching it even after everyone I know who saw it, said it was good. All right so I finally got to see it and what a great movie. The Bill Conti score is there, the turtles Cuff and Link, Maria from the old neighborhood, Paulie and his irrascible ways. Rocky now runs a restaurant in Philly named Adrian's, whose death he is still mourning, he's lost connection with his son who is trying to escape the shadow of his famous dad. Rocky's future is stuck with his past as his life consists of regaling customers with old fight stories. When he decides that he needs to fight again because "he still has stuff in the basement". The action builds slow as we are brought into the characters lives and we feel so much for these characters the story builds and builds and pulls you in. Well written and acted without all the histronics of the sequels and just the pure heart and soul of the original Rocky. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

I walked into this one five minutes late, which I normally don't do, but I thought it would be okay because the credits usually eat up five minutes anyway. But in this case, the movie had started already, at a scene that I knew was halfway through the film. I thought to myself "did I come in one hour and five minutes late instead of just five minutes late?" But what the director does is he starts at an important scene from the middle, then jumps back two weeks.<br /><br />The film is a very faithful remake of the original, and it's always interesting to see how the director's going to stage any given scene. The one thing that is very different is that neither of Owen's divorcing parents are ever seen; the father is only heard on the phone, and the mum, who he lives with, is only seen from the shoulders down, heightening the sense of Owen's isolation and loneliness. No adult befriends Owen, and his classmates are either indifferent or hostile. Owen's moral lapse comes out strongly in this film, and he's so happy to finally have a companion that he forgets that Abby is a heartless killer.<br /><br />One complaint is the soundtrack, which is too moody, and when it turns moody it projects that something bad is going to happen. I don't remember much music in the original at all. But since its intention is to make the viewers tense, it sure does its job well.<br /><br />Owen is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, the young boy who was in The Road, and he was 13 at the time it was filmed. Abby is played by Chlo? Grace Moretz, who was Hit Girl in the movie Kick Ass, and she was also 13 when the film was made. Both actors have been working since 2005 and have been in a bunch of films!</p></body></html>

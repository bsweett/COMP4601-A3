<meta name="summary" content="Good Performance by Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in Ok Romantic Comedy..."></head><body><p>Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is the sequel to the popular Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) that conveys Bridget Jones' (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) most intimate thoughts and feelings in her diary.  This time the audience is introduced to her new diary, which opens with the happiness and joy that Bridget experiences through her love life.  Everything seems to be perfect, as her boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), a human rights lawyer, provides the most delicious escapades in the bedroom, at least according to Bridget, who willingly shares this with her diary and people she meets.  This sharing of secrets becomes a little repetitive as the film moves along.<br /><br />Preoccupation with obsessive dreaming of Mark affects her life, as she thoughtlessly steps into trouble and embarrassment.  This embarrassment further increases her already strong insecurities.  Insecurity then leads to situations where she begins to question Mark's honesty, loyalty, and love for her through assumptions that she makes based on information inflamed with jealousy.  She could be a poster child for insecurity, as she continuously questions Mark's integrity and in the end only hurts herself.<br /><br />In the middle of her predicaments regarding her relationship with Mark she once again meets the sly womanizer Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who is the anchor for a TV travel program called "The Smooth Guide."  The TV station that Bridget works for wants to make the program more accessible for a wider audience and suggests that she becomes a co-host on "The Smooth Guide."  Initially Bridget refuses, but as expected, she gives in.  Their first episode together is to be shot in Thailand, and Bridget brings one of her friends to help chaperone her.<br /><br />When they arrive in Thailand Daniel turns up his charm and tries to sway Bridget to give him a second chance, however, Bridget is cautious as she was once hurt before.  This happens while Bridget's friend hooks up with a younger man who asks her to bring home a gift from England when they are about to leave.  The na?ve Bridget thinks she is going to be helpful, but she has evidently never seen Bangkok Hilton (1989), Return to Paradise (1998), and Brokedown Palace (1999), which would make her a lot more cautious.  Just as in these other films there are drugs in the item that she is to bring to England, and she is sent to a Thai prison.  Who could help her get out of prison?  Well, that might not be a surprise to the audience, as they will see this film unfold.<br /><br />Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason delivers a cinematic experience full of obvious stereotypes that are turned into slapstick moments.  Furthermore, the film attempts to make fun of Bridget's lack of knowledge and insecurities, which occasionally work, but frequently lead into awkward and confusing moments where the audience does not know whether to feel sorry for Bridget or to laugh at her.  As if it was not enough, the film uses clich&eacute;s that have been seen in similar films many times before throughout several decades, and this enhances the predictability of the story.  Ultimately, this sequel falls way short of the accomplishments made in the initial film.<br /><br />As mentioned, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason falls short compared to the first film, yet the film has its funny moments.  Those who are Ren&eacute;e Zellweger fans might want to see this film, as her performance is actually remarkable.  However, overall this film is only a mediocre romantic comedy that is worth renting on an evening when the audience feels that they need to put things in perspective in regards to relationships and love.</p></body></html>

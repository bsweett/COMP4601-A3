<meta name="summary" content="Mild thriller plays games with its audience"></head><body><p>HIDE AND SEEK<br /><br />(USA/Germany - 2005)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)<br />Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS<br /><br />Following his wife's tragic death, a New York psychologist (Robert DeNiro) takes his 9 year old daughter (Dakota Fanning) and relocates to a remote house in the country, where the little girl acquires an 'imaginary friend' who seems intent on ruining her father's life.<br /><br />Mild, inconsequential thriller in which DeNiro's widowed protagonist engages in psychological conflict with a rebellious child who appears to blame him for the loss of her mother. Perhaps because it IS so mild, the climactic revelations aren't nearly as shocking as director John Polson and screenwriter Ari Schlossberg might have hoped, and the narrative builds to a lacklustre conclusion. DeNiro is miscast as the 'saintly' psychologist who tolerates his daughter's worst excesses, and the glossy production values are wasted. Also starring Famke Janssen as a fellow psychologist, and a virtually unrecognizable Amy Irving as DeNiro's ill-fated wife. Casual viewers will get their money's worth, but die-hard horror fans are urged to look elsewhere.</p></body></html>

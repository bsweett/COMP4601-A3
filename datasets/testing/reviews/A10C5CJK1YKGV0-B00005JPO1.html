It delivered the goods for everyone waiting to check back in with the rough-and-tumble Dr. Henry Jones, (junior ... ahem). But having grown up with Indiana Jones, I've already gotten past the Lucas Factor of being let down long ago. I hung my head in shame after I scurried home from the theatre after seeing '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">The Temple of Doom</a>' back in 1984. I wish I had missed that film altogether, even to this day. Needless to say there is a section of this film which I find down-right embarrassing and the Cthulu call for George Lucas.<br /><br />Crystal Skull takes a nose dive during the 'Jungle Chase' scene which seems to be action filler so Cate Blanchett and Shia LeBeouf can rack up some screen-time minutes or perhaps fill a quota or a  contractual agreement with the producers. Whatever it was, it was not just the slowest part of the movie but also the most unnecessary and the biggest reminder, or throw back to The Temple of Doom, thus far. Going over cliffs was well covered in parts two and three, but now we have to revisit it again just so we can add to the run time.<br /><br />I do realize that it was just framework to the very interesting fight-action sequence with the ants which was cool and had a nostalgic feel to it. I think that kind of action is what people tuned in for, but what came before it in the ten minutes previous and the next ten minutes after, should have been left in the editing hard-drives.<br /><br />The 'Jungle Chase' scene though, more directly is classic Lucas faire. He's probably covered this same ground in almost every film he's ever done. A lot of people have complained loudly about just this sort of thing spoiling the Star Wars franchise. So why bother to do it again? The scene of a young fighter precariously hanging on to some shaky edifice, fighting for his life with legs splayed akimbo, desperately trying to fend off his enemy and move the story forward with some type of sword fight. Sigh ... please.<br /><br />How many times did we see this stuff in Episode I, II and II? Too many. It only seemed that Lucas began to learn his lessons by the third film, which was already too late as he had alienated his core audience and even most adults. His interest in his Lego Land contracts and peddling to toddlers always looked to interfere with his real filmmaking, unlike Spielberg who never pandered or bowed full-bend to the marketing aspect of these productions never forgetting that the reason for the film was not the toys.<br /><br />So why Spielberg would let this kind of element creep in and slow down such a good movie is beyond me. Maybe he just can't tell the guy, his good friend, George -- that what he's 'seeing' isn't that great after all. We saw this same element in Jedi, which killed the movie and now he pulls it out once more. At least you can see that Spielberg learned a few things over the years with some of his other movies, by using the absurd to insert his heroes into history like in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXA2">Forrest Gump</a> in the 'Doom Town' sequence.<br /><br />In all honestly, this film is a perfect candidate for fanedit dot com. A place where film editors, some professional, some work-man, anonymously re-edit films removing certain scenes or offending elements, tightening them up and making them better movies in most cases. A good example of work done through fan edit was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007V6ITE">Blade III</a> (retitled 'Kill The King'). All instance of Hannibal King, aka Ryan Reynolds is completely removed. Having seen the movie, I can tell you without doubt it's leagues better than the studio release.<br /><br />I thought I had seen everything in film, but watching Dr. Jones step into the refrigidaire and close the door on himself in order to avoid a nuclear blast was pretty riveting to say the least and very inventive. It's exactly this kind of chess-playing in the writing that most people are hoping to see. The scene where Indy crests over the berm and is face to face with the mushroom cloud is a great piece of film-making. For the last two years I've been seeing artificial CG renderings of atomic and nuclear bomb blasts showing up on blogs and littering youtube, now I know why and where they came from. Some people were put-off by this and cried foul, but every element in this franchise is over the top. Trying to ground it in Christopher Nolan workman-style realism is foolish. Are you paying attention?<br /><br />Upping the ante at this point in the film was pretty genius as well as wiley, making room for excellent long-range planning. Immediately after the radioactive scrub down, we learn that Dr. Jones, is ... gasp ... an Army General ... and then a member of OSS ... gasp! ... and later a double-agent within the CIA. The back story that was built up lends this whole franchise to now be reinvented and the older adventures of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDDVE">Young Indiana Jones</a> to be forgotten and revisited, probably picked up as Dr. Jones runs through a secret trap door from Hitler's Bunker with a smoking gun, not played by Shia LeBeuf, but possibly some as of yet unknown. The writers scored a big plus here and I'm sure Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were very happy when they read that portion of the script.<br /><br />The ending of the film where the mantle doesn't pass, yet, is probably the question both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have been batting around themselves. Who will take over my life's work, when my hair is too gray, too thin, my time too short and my interest in the job too waning? You have to wonder who exactly has been groomed to carry on all those unfinished projects, the war adventures of Indiana Jones being apart of that probably massive pile.<br /><br />The Fifth and likely conclusion to this franchise in this era is already being discussed, planned and will probably be announced sometime in March of 2009. Harrison Ford is close to 70 now so time is of the essence in every aspect. The directors are older, too as are the producers. The question of handing his whip & pistol over is a tricky one. Edging out the hero from a franchise has proven fatal before. Yes, back to Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer we go.<br /><br />There was a time in Hollywood when studios no longer wanted to bankroll and produce comic book action movies because a long string of failures that had almost bankrupted several studios in the mid-nineties. A few actually folded. Then along came Wesley Snipes and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780624890">Blade</a>. It's no secret that Blade reinvigorated the genre and thus the current generation, singularly, owes him a debt of gratitude greater than his IRS burden or the value of Ed McMahon's home. Blade made a lot of money and gave both the confidence and greenlight to other movies that in turn did well and made money.<br /><br />But one day, David Goyer disagreed with Wesley Snipes like a bad episode of House MD and broadcast it unfairly from the rooftops, thus Alienating our favorite Vampire Killer. Wesley didn't think Vampire Hunters teaming up with him was a good idea or that the Vampire Hunters should be teenagers. It sounded good, because after all Vampire films started off with stuff like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AUHOK">Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter</a>, again -- it sounded good. But, Wesley openly disagreed with the direction of the franchise and was ignored. It didn't go well, neither did the movie. But I mentioned this already, didn't I? In this scenario, with Harrison Ford, there is no disagreement, but the problem is the same. The studio needs to extricate its hero and find a way to continue without being a clich&eacute;. All I can say is: Good luck, folks.<br /><br />Overall, this story covers a lot of ground, and perhaps in retrospect, maybe too much. Maybe the flaw of this film was giving the audience too much to chew on. I was happy to see Cate Blanchett in something other than a period costume drama of either Elizabeth or a depression era redressing of Katherine Hepburn. I felt the film time that she was given was adequate (minus the 'Jungle Chase') and  her character was more than fleshed out for the escapist action drama that we were all sinking into. Sometimes not overstating a character gives the character more power. Look at Julianne More as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AEF6D6">Maude Lebowski</a> who has little screen time compared to Walter or The Dude, but she has one of the most memorable modern film roles in recent history. Who doesn't remember the line: 'Do you like coitus, Jefferey?'<br /><br />You don't need to beat a viewer over the head in order to make a point. I think we all got the evil persona that she was after the Area 51 scene. Doctor-Professor was a nice touch. Look for it soon in the next Pixar flick. Blanchett's period costume though left much to be desired as she looked more like Lara's work-camp daughter from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9M">Doctor Zhivago</a> than she ever did as a female version of Dr. Evil in her gray and unappealing jumpsuit. Trying to work us on a seductive Madame Blavatsky angle was good and quite interesting and probably factual to period maniacs of the time, but they overplayed her hand and dashed the project into the rocks that they thought were heading for, all in the drama.<br /><br />Also, as much as I like Ray Winstone, (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UV33">Sexy Beast</a> is a masterpiece), I felt that his addition was overwrought and unnecessary. Somehow his whole presence seemed very last-minute, maybe his role had something to do with the script leak. Maybe. Maybe not.<br /><br />The ending is quite good. The whole story arc of Roswell, Area 51, General Jones comes together nicely and is probably one of the few times in blockbuster cinema where the subject matter is dealt with in an interesting manner and not treated as an off-handed joke. Knight's 'Signs' was an interesting mix of fundamental religion versus new-age lore and was treated well there. It was handled with equal skill here.<br /><br />Maybe, with a few more viewings and a couple of sit-downs with the commentary track (ahem ... next DVD version of course, as this one doesn't have one), my thoughts will develop and change, but until then, I think I've gilded the Lilly to the point of wilting.<br /><br />.... ....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A surprising and impressive achievement!"></head><body><p>I rented this because I had heard so many good things about it and after watching it a couple times, it certainly did not disappoint.  Zach Braff has done something remarkable for a debut film project, and its an achievement he should be very proud of.  This film works on several levels, but mostly, its a relevant film for the younger generation that is too often assigned to take drugs to solve whatever problems their parents don't want to deal with.  The numbing of the emotional pains of life doesn't lead to a life fully lived, and in a sense, we are turning our children into emotional zombies.  This film is a wake up call...get off the drugs and experience life the way its meant to be experienced.  Emotional pain is a burden everyone has to work through and deal with, and finally accept before moving on.<br /><br />The great thing about this independent film, as in many independent films, is that it doesn't follow the standard Hollywood formula.  You are taken in with the character and experience his life over the course of four days, as Andrew (Zach Braff) returns home to attend his mother's funeral after a nine year absence.  At home, he avoids his father and hooks up with friends who seem to all be stuck in dead-end jobs (some, quite literally).  Andrew is the only one trying to make something of his life, as a struggling actor in Hollywood who's claim to fame was playing a mentally handicapped football player on a TV show.  He meets the lovely and quirky Natalie Portman at the doctor's office.  Some people have doubted her abilities as an actress after seeing her in the "Star Wars" prequels, but make no mistake...see this film and "Closer" and you will be captivated by her range.  I loved her performances in both films, but she especially has unique charm in "Garden State"...helping Andrew come to terms with his long-delayed grief over an incident that happened when he was much younger, guilt that he put aside for years.<br /><br />There are many quirky characters in this film and a couple of them seem caught up in some pyramid schemes.  My favorite small performance is by Method Man, who almost steals the film by his very brief, but hilarious scene.  Perhaps the only person who seems out of place in a film like this is Ian Holme, whom I can't view in any film without thinking Bilbo Baggins!  He often appears like a ghost in this film by his wardrobe choices, and his role is small (his most significant scene is cut and on the deleted scenes special feature) and he just doesn't resemble Zach enough to convince me that he's his father in the film.  It was a minor distraction and what I think is a serious miscast of that role, but not enough for me to subtract a star from the rating.  That's because the overall message of the film is simply powerful and one we should all take to heart.  We should live a life that's uniquely ours and seek moments where we attempt to do things no one else might have ever done before.  To live is to risk, and we can't truly live if we are drugging away our personal pains (whether through doctor-prescribed zoloft/ritalin, or through ecstasy and other illegal means of artificial happiness).  We control our own happiness and we can't be responsible for making other people happy.  That's the garden state of our own desires.  See this film again and again.  Its simply amazing and Zach Braff deserves huge kudos for making this film.</p></body></html>

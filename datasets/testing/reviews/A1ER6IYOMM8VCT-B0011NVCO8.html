<meta name="summary" content="GOOD BUT, MISSING SOMETHING? 3 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>I love a great gangster movie! White Heat, Scarface, The Godfather(part 1 & 2), Goodfellas, Casino.....the list goes on and on. 'American Gangster' has a great cast, excellent production, interesting story, but for all it has going for it, the film didn't completely draw me in. It's certainly worth seeing, but I don't see myself watching this movie more than one or two more times......once to see the extended addition. I rate it 3 1/2 stars. Rent it before you buy it.</p></body></html>

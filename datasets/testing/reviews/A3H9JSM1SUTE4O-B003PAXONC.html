And yes, Will Smith is very good.  For about 45 minutes this movie teases with huge potential and then it descends into below average jolts of blood-thirsty mutants jumping out of the dark with their mouths open.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />In the end, super-hero-with-abs Will Smith (certainly not the relatable, ordinary man of the novel) sacrifices himself for no reason and then there's a hastily  tacked on ending of survivors entering a walled-in compound somewhere in Vermont.  Is there unintentional irony here?  Have they traded freedom for the illusion of security?<br /><br />No legend.  No myth.  And finally, not much of a story.<br /><br />I was hoping for a movie that tickled my brain as well as my eyeballs -- like "Blade Runner."</p></body></html>

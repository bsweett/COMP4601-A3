<meta name="summary" content="Quirky Johnny Depp performance doesn't save pedestrian horror/thriller"></head><body><p>David Koepp ("Panic Room") wrote and directed this horror/thriller flick, an  adaptation of a Stephen King story.  Johnny Depp sinks his teeth into the role of Mort Rainey, a successful author tortured by the memory of discovering his wife's infidelity.<br /><br />Living alone in his gorgeous, rustic lake cabin, Rainey is plodding through the hum-drum writer's life (procrastination intermixed with drinking and breaking vows to stop smoking) when a mysterious stranger shows up at his front door.  John Shooter (John Turturro), who appears to be Mississippi Amish, claims that Rainey stole one of his stories, and he demands a reckoning.  It's clear from Shooter's stony gaze (and Turturro's inherent zaniness) that Rainey faces dire consequences if he does not comply.<br /><br />Is Shooter telling the truth?  Can Rainey bluff his way through, or does he have to hire some muscle (Charles S Dutton)?  And what role does Rainey's soon-to-be ex (Maria Bello) and her lover (Timothy Hutton) play in the whole mix?<br /><br />The Law of Economy of Characters, plus the knowledge that you're watching a Stephen King flick, basically gives away the creepy ending.  So you're left with the performances to keep you interested in the story.  For the most part, it succeeds, and largely due to Depp's willingness to find the  shadiest sides of his own persona.  What could have easily been a paint-by-numbers flick becomes something more interesting.<br /><br />But it must be said that this is neither King's nor Koepp's best work.  "Secret Window" is a fine purchase from the bargain bin, but only the most die-hard King or Depp fanatic will keep putting this DVD back into the player several times.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Memento delivers"></head><body><p>Memento is a great movie.  By reading other reviews, you can get the idea of the plot.  I watched this expecting unique storytelling and a great climax.<p>Memento begins with a murder and then works its way back through the eyes of Lenny who has know short term memory.  Each scene begins with us not knowing how Lenny got there.  This is appropriate (not a gimmick) since Lenny has no idea either. <p>I paid attention to each scene trying not to miss any details that would confuse the ending.  But there really aren't any details to miss.  The ending covers all the bases and explains everything, yet there are many unresoved questions, and I think the director Nolan wanted it that way.<p>While Memento was unique, it was also quite humorous.  Guy Pierce did an excellent job of portraying Lenny.  Lenny seemed so trusting of everyone and since he had no memory of them, he assumed they were always being honest with him.<p>So while this movie is dark at its core, it portrays an innocence and lightheartedness that makes it fun to watch.<p>If you watch this movie and are somewhat confused then check out the movie's website.  It gives a lot of good information that may shed light on Lenny's condition.</p></body></html>

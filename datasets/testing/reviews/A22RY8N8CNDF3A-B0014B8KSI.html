He is divorced, a gambler and alcoholic of sorts so tied to the fixer job at Kenner Bach's Law firm.<br /><br />Michael has his own problems with gambling, which leave him almost broke.  He is playing poker one night when he receives a call to drive to Westchester to fix a hit and run problem.  After Michael handles the executive involved, he drives back in the early dawn, but suddenly parks and decides to take a walk through a field.  As he is looking at some horses his car blows up.

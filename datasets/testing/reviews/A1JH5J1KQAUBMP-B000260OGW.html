<meta name="summary" content="Classically constructed western"></head><body><p>Two veteran free-range cattlemen (Kevin Costner and the incomparable Robert Duvall) must enter hostile territory to get medical attention for the wounded boy who works for them (Diego Luna).  The town is under the thumb of an unscrupulous cattle baron who despises free-rangers and has no compunctions about killing them (Michael Gambon).  This is a classic Western in which the two protagonists are compelled by their moral code to face danger instead of retreating from it.  Costner and Duvall have magnificent chemistry in this film--Duvall as the moral conscience of the pair, and Costner as the former killer who is haunted by his past and longs to be able to see himself as a good man.  Although director Costner has had a somewhat checkered career, he demonstrates here that he is a man with true talent.  The final gunfight is a real highlight and not to be missed./</p></body></html>

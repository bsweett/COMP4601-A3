<meta name="summary" content="Keeping the Beatles alive for all generations to continue to cherish"></head><body><p>I'm usually uncomfortable about anybody singing Beatles songs.  I grew up with the Beatles so, of course, I had to see this movie.  One thing I have basically confirmed again to myself about this movie, is that John Lennon and Paul McCartney were fabulous songwriters.  Some songs here were sang slower that the original Beatle versions so it's easy to cherish every written word of the songs while hearing them with a mildly darker, grungier, intention.  Listen again to the words of "I've Just Seen a Face."  What an excellent song!  Nobody writes songs like this anymore.  No wonder everybody continues to love the Beatles.<br /><br />You know, if you liked this film, then check out 1978's "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"  which starred Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees, plus an all-star cast.  It's basically the same intention that you're seeing with "Across the Universe".  In "Sgt Pepper..." you'll get a series of go-nowhere events that allows the stars of the film to break out into a Beatles song.  Plus, in "Sgt. Pepper..." you'll get a variety of popular seventies artists singing Beatles songs.  Many which became hits.  Aerosmith did "Come Together", Alice Cooper did "Because", Steve Martin did "Maxwell's Silver Hammer", Earth, Wind, and Fire did "Got to Get You Into My Life", and Robin Gibb did "Oh Darling".  Plus lots of other songs by various artists.<br /><br />Though the film "Sgt. Pepper..." was considered silly at the time, all you "Across the Universe" fans just might think that it's one to cherish as well.  At least, rent it and check it out.</p></body></html>

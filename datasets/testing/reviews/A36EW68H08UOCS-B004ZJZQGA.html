<meta name="summary" content="Black, black comedy about Irish Hit Men"></head><body><p>Warning: this film may not be for you.  The two leading characters are Irish hit men, and their language would shock those shocked by coarse language.  There are also essentially no "good guys."  In addition to murderers, the film is populated by prostitutes and drug dealers.<br /><br />But since violent and profane films have become prevalent, I think that they are worth your time, like any film, if they are good.  This one is good.<br /><br />We were invited to a friend's for movie night and the Mrs. didn't care for it.  We didn't know what film had been chosen and I think she felt a little blind-sided.  As the opening credits showed the writer and director was Martin McDonagh, I was a little prepared for the desperately comic violence that followed.  Mr. McDonagh, you see, is the Irish playwright who gave us "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1408111071">The Lieutenant of Inishmore (Student Editions)</a>", a play in which much murder and mayhem follows the death of a cat belonging to a dim, but fearful, Irish terrorist.<br /><br />Colin Farrell plays Ray and Brendan Gleeson plays Ken.  Ray and Ken have been sent to Bruges to hide out after the botched murder of a priest.  Ken has been a hit man for years and accepts the baggage that comes with the job.  He finds Bruges delightful and at one level the film plays as a magnificent travelogue for the town.  In the film it seems as picturesque as Amsterdam or Venice, but with less tourists.  Ray is a new hit man, and the botched hit was his fault, and his first job.  We can't tell if Ray is jumpy only because of guilt over the bad priest job (as Farrell implies with his acting), or if (as he says) he truly doesn't like Bruges.  Ray didn't know much about Bruges before being sent there, Farrell tells us in an f-bomb-laced opening narration.  He concludes "It's in Belgium."<br /><br />While Ken is delightfully taking in the centuries-old architecture, Ray comes along to brood and complain until they come upon a movie in production.  Ray is entranced by Chloe, played by Clemence Poesy, a woman working at the edges of the film crew, and he doesn't quite know what to make of American dwarf Jimmy, played by Jordan Prentice.  Ray keeps calling Jimmy a midget, and he harbors a grudge against Americans for killing John Lennon.<br /><br />Ray and Ken work for Harry, who ominously orders them to Bruges in Ray's opening monologue.  We know Harry is a darker, more sinister character than our protagonists before he phones Ken with an assignment that gives the usually agreeable Ken grave reservations.  McDonagh gradually shows us Harry - played by Ralph Fiennes with full profane fury.<br /><br />McDonagh's screenplay peppers the proceedings with comic dialogue on subjects such as the morality of being an assassin, ("I have to reconcile that with the fact that yes, I have killed people. Not many people. And most of them were not very nice people. Apart from one person."), diverse views on the pleasures of Bruges ("Ken, I grew up in Dublin. I love Dublin. If I grew up on a farm, and was retarded, Bruges might impress me but I didn't, so it doesn't.") and choice of weapon for assassination ("An Uzi? I'm not from South Central Los Angeles. I didn't come here to shoot twenty black ten year olds in a drive-by. I want a normal gun for a normal person.")<br /><br />In Bruges is the kind of film where a character can be sent to murder another character and find THAT character about to commit suicide - then finish the scene with the assassin instead sending the other character away on a train.  But it is also the kind of film where deadly violence erupts repeatedly, sometimes with ironic and often with comic overtones.<br /><br />So - if you're in the market for a black comedy about Irish assassins, "In Bruges" fits the bill.</p></body></html>

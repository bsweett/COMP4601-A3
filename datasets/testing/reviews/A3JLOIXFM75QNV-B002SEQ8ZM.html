It revolves around a mom and dad and their daughter Coraline moving into a huge and sorta creepy looking victorian manor which is also occupied by other weird tenants. It is based on a children's book, but the look and feel of the film is certainly on the creepy side. Personally, I think younger kids would get frightenend after watching certain parts and there is this high wire act by these 2 old lady tenants that creeped ME out.<br /><br />The plot is actually a tad on the confusing side, especially towards the end, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The fantastical elements were wonderfully executed and the grim, washed-out feel to the film really created the mood. There are a few great but weird characters and it seems like everyone has some mystery to hide.<br /><br />It's a shame it didn't really get much recognition when it came out into theaters, but I predict it will do nicely on DVD.</p></body></html>

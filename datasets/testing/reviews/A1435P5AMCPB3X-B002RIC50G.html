This is the backstory to the great series of books/films in the Hannibal Lector series.  Based in Lithuania and France during the WWII and the aftermath of the Nurenberg Trials, Hannibal Rising takes us through a backstory of how a montser is born.  Guspard Illiel does a decent job as a young Lector, but the performance was a bit stale, but it is tought to follow Sir Hopkins.  The overall cast was decent, story plausable and reasonable fit with the story of the series.  I'm sure this will not be the last in this series.  There will likely be a filler inbetween this one and Manhunter/Red Dragon soon to come in the next 2 years.  Worth going to see if you are a fan, and if you are new, see Manhunter (better of the two) or Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal first.</p></body></html>

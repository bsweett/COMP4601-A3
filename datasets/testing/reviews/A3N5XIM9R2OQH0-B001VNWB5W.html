<meta name="summary" content="Not un-awesome"></head><body><p>After years of superhero/comic book/graphic novel adaptations that promised big things but fell just short of their marks (I'm looking your way, "The Dark Knight"), Zack Snyder's awe-inspiring adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's "Watchmen" has finally delivered the goods: a truly epic film version of a beloved comics institution that expands on the source material without compromising its vision.  While definitely not for the squeamish or short of attention span (or for the small child someone decided to bring to the theater where I saw it), "Watchmen" is still one of the few Hollywood products of the past few years that manage to be thoughtful and entertaining at the same time.  In a move that breaks with pretty much every other comic/graphic novel adaptation to come out this decade, "Watchmen" is set squarely in the real world, or at least in one possible version of it, and the actions of its protagonists don't take place in a fictional city or a vacuum but against a Cold War backdrop of paranoia, fear-mongering, and the looming threat of global annihilation.  The plot leaps back and forth and time and sprawls in all sorts of directions, with violent confrontations sharing space with quieter, more reflective moments, but Snyder manages to keep things moving inexorably forward and maintain tight control of a sizeable ensemble cast throughout.<br /><br />For fans of the book, the setup of the movie should be instantly familiar: the year is 1985, Nixon is still president following the abolition of term limits, the U.S. and the Soviets are at the brink of mutually assured destruction in the face of a showdown over Afghanistan, and costumed heroes have been chased underground following a popular backlash and a governmental ban on their activities.  More important than the similarities in plot, though, is Snyder's shocking level of success in transplanting the world of the book onto the big screen.  While certain aspects of the story naturally had to be excised, the bleak, uncompromising worldview and moral complexity of Moore and Gibbons's book has made it to the screen almost fully intact.  Where Snyder's last directorial effort, "300," was generally simplistic, humorless, and excessive, "Watchmen" by contrast is ambiguous, challenging, darkly comic, and never overreliant on its uniformly excellent special effects.  Some of the fight scenes are a little overly stylized and implausible (though again nowhere as annoyingly so as in "300"), but given that they take up a few minutes of a film that runs over two and a half hours that's a minor concern at worst.  Besides, Snyder's gritty, grimy portrayal of New York City and the unflinching portrayals of brutality are more than enough to outweigh a little excessive stylization.  The use of music is great as well, with the intro set to Dylan's "The Times They Are A-changing" and the sex scene set to Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" being especially memorable.<br /><br />For a movie accompanied by so much hype (and a clearly large budget), the cast is pretty short on big names, but the relative lack of star power turns out to be something of an advantage, with the sprawling ensemble fitting almost perfectly into their roles and the film's alternate reality without overpowering it.  The juiciest parts go to Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the smirking, misogynistic nihilist Edward "The Comedian" Blake and Jackie Earle Haley as the tormented vigilante Walter "Rorschach" Kovacs, and neither disappoints.  The Comedian is an especially ambiguous figure for this genre: he appears on the surface to be (and in many ways is) a bloodthirsty villain, but a closer examination reveals someone who sees past the veneer of civilization to grasp mankind's true (and ugly) nature, and can't think of any reaction beyond laughter.  As played by Morgan, The Comedian is an almost completely irredeemable character, but I still couldn't help finding him at least a little sympathetic.  In the equally pivotal role of Rorschach, Jackie Earle Haley is even more compelling, with the air of menace in his voice (and, later, his face) more than making up for his character's laconic nature.  Much as in the book, Rorschach is as much a force of nature as a character, equally as capable of monstrous violence as of heroism, and Haley's alternately muted and fearsome performance captures all of the inner turmoil and bizarre compulsions that drive him forward.  Malin Akerman seems to have been singled out for criticism in her role as the second Silk Spectre, which I don't find entirely fair--her work in some of the more dramatic scenes in the later going didn't make me forget Merryl Streep, but her character clearly wasn't intended to be the most heavyweight of the bunch, and she's at least adequate most of the time.  Besides, her near-total hotness and prominent presence in the aforementioned sex scene should more than mitigate any concerns about her acting chops.  The rest of the major players--Billy Crudup as the tenuously human genetic mutation Dr. Manhattan; Carla Gugino as the aging, jaded original Silk Spectre; Matthew Goode as the superhuman crime-fighter-turned-tycoon Ozymandias; Patrick Wilson as the nostalgic, relatively normal and well-adjusted Nite Owl--are all pretty competent, even if a few of them seem to have been picked at least in large part for their resemblance to the characters from the book.  And of course, Robert Wisden deserves special mention for his frighteningly believable performance as the neurotic, high-strung President Nixon.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of a few minor flaws, Watchmen still easily manages to emerge as one of the top Hollywood movies released this decade.  While there were certainly a few concerns going in--its prodigious length, its daunting source material, the spotty record of recent superhero films--I for one was glued to the screen from minute one.  Having seen the movie, Moore's refusal to have his name associated with the project now seems more like pettiness than principle.  This is one adaptation he should be proud of.</p></body></html>

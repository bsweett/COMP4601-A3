<meta name="summary" content="Sophomoric Action"></head><body><p>I  wanted to see this when it first came out, and I'm glad I didn't. This film seemed like one big advert for a universal studios feature ride. There was zero believability whatsover as the main characters fall for thousands of yards and like cartoon characters survive without bumps or bruises. Sled on the fossilized skull of some unbelievably large dinosuar, ride a broken coal cart like it was a roller coaster etc.<br /><br />The main characters were likeable. The absent-minded professor, the trailguide, the unhappy nephew. But everything was dumbed-down and cartoonized presumably to appeal to an audience of children.<br /><br />I found myself fast-forwarding scenes where characters were constantly yelling and screaming as they were being chased and hounded, an the really sappy scene in the middle.<br /><br />Kids might like the action-y bits. Myself, I found it got old about halfway through. 2 stars.</p></body></html>

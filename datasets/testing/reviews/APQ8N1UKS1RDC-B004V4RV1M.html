<meta name="summary" content="R.I.P. Karl Hardman"></head><body><p>Though it was last month,I found out today that Karl Hardman<br />has passed on.  For those of you who do not recognize the<br />name he will always be famous for the GREAT performance<br />of the jerk husband/father in N.O.T.L.DEAD who's famous line<br />was....THE CELLER!  It's the safest place!!!  He not only<br />was a gifted make up artist,but for not being a actor blew<br />the pants off big bankable actors I've seen with just his<br />soul performance in the immortal N.O.T.L.D. When I first<br />read the news I said NO! For I really liked him. He will<br />always be a part of us and for you DIE HARD HORROR fanatics<br />you can really see him for who he was in the 25th anniversary<br />edit. only avail.on VHS but for low $$$ and worth a look to<br />see how he did the make-up and his input. Speaking of input<br />buy N.O.T.L.D. millennium edition it is the ultimate version.<br />It has commentary from almost everyone involved in the film<br />and it is priceless.  I myself am a avid FRIGHT fanatic and<br />proudly own Sir Romero's N.O.T.L.D. it is SOOOO influential<br />to our GREATEST Decades of CREEPERS the 70's and 80's!<br />My fav. scene will be the truck after the fire and the Zombie<br />Ghouls fighting over the intestine's and the zombie girl in<br />hospital gown doing the shuffle walk while eating a arm.<br />Say it now without hesitation NIGHT of the LIVING DEAD<br />is ONE of thee GREATEST HORROR films of ALL time!<br />Also like to point out the zombie girl with the<br />immortal look of the hair covering left eye and the<br />famous garden trowel scene is no other than Kyra Schon<br />and she is the loving daughter of Karl Hardman.<br />Please own the NIGHT!!!  IT IS A MUST!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Juliette Binoche & Johnny Depp Have Delicious Chemistry!!"></head><body><p>I would go as far as to call this a modern era classic film!<br />This story is an excellent one which Juliette Binoche carries off well...<br />a mysterious woman and her daughter wander the european countryside<br />and come upon a quaint little village. They decide to set up shop<br />there and much magic & chocolate treats ensue!<br />Even though Johnny Depp's character doesn't come in until halfway<br />through the movie, he just lights it up!<br />The combination of he and Binoche is one you can't tear yourself<br />away from until Depp leaves the screen!--That guy is pure magic!<br />This is a keeper for sure!

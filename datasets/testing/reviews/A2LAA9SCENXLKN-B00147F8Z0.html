<meta name="summary" content="Could have been a 5/5 masterwork. BUT THEY...I will tell you in the review."></head><body><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. However, in this review I am reviewing the Unrated version.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />A.V.P:R|UN-R[4.0BETA](2007)<br /><br />What's the problem with the movie? Well, lemme tell you the good things. Every good thing from all 9 previous installments of the two separate franchises is carried into this film. Now for the bad things. There are horrid side stories that don't MATTER to this film. IN ALL OTHER ALIEN AND PREDATOR MOVIES, THE SIDE STORIES USUALLY MEANT SOMETHING! HERE THERE JUST ADDED TO MAKE THE FILM OVER 100 MINUTES!!!!! @#$%. And here's the real crap. Everything that is good about this movie, has the Ninja Assassin effect. YOU CAN'T SEE ANY OF IT. True both Alien and Predator (and Batman) movies are typically dark, BUT YOU CAN'T SEE ANY OF THE BRAWL!!! Do you understand? If you can't see anything, WHY HAVE IT!?!?!<br /><br />Oh wait, you can see something. THE STUPID SIDE STORIES!!! It's half the time boring, half the time as dark as space. Now, I will say something good about this movie. It updates the original ALIEN title screen from the first Alien, to say AVP:R and be more awesome. But that's just flashy effects covering up the horridness of this film. AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL! The action is awesome and fast pace, the screams and blood are top notch, and everything good about the original installments is carried into this one. YOU JUST CAN'T @#$%ING SEE ANYTHING!!!!<br /><br />Who the he11 is the cast&crew director...let's see...wikipedia...The Strause Bros.! Let's see what they've done...well I can see why the effects are so good they are special effects masters...m hm...Holly $#!T! They've done The X-Files Movie? The Nutty Professor? Titanic...oh wait...they're just special effects masters. They haven't directed a single film besides AVP:R. YOU DON'T DO THAT! A Big Blockbuster or any major film with a big budget doesn't deserve first time directors. Film directors should have experience in original material of independent matter and not jump immediately. Spielberg did two independent films before he directed a TV movie before he directed Jaws! YOU NEED EXPERIENCE!!!<br /><br />And only having experience with special effects is the worst kind. But this does worry me, because wouldn't a special effects guy know your movie hast to be bright? Wouldn't a special effects duo be used to bright effects? Well let's get the producer. John Davis is the big one. Holly $#!T, The Predator Trilogy? AVP? But no, he's produced some stuff you might not be so fond of. Asteroid, WaterWorld, Little Monsters, the new Dr. Dollitle, I Robot, Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties, and Marmaduke. But surely he couldn't have messed up the lighting for those movies, most of them are dead bright! Maybe the Predator movies and I, Robot aren't so bright but the lighting in them is still good!<br /><br />So another producer is on the list...Walter Hill. He is a screenwriter. He shouldn't know anything about lighting, and all the stuff he's done is unknown. I guess he co-wrote Aliens, but between 3 people! And I think we all don't like Alien 3, but I do. The only two notable films he didn't direct and are between more than one person. HE'S NEVER PRODUCED! I blame him. He had no experience, and just thought to himself "Alien and Predator are traditionally dark movies." Blaugh. Now that we've got that out of the way, let's see what else is in store. For one thing this movie has credit for, is for showing us a more in-depth look at the Predator ship and homeworld. But those come very early and don't really help this film.<br /><br />I could see they wanted to make a third AVP, because most people thought they could before the first came out, and I see that they've been testing on the Alien parasites. This could lead to some really good stories. In fact, look at the comics and video games that have come out!!! There's a scene in this film where both the father and son die from an alien in their stomach. I found this ironic, but some might just find this disturbing or even symbolic. I don't know, it's all three put into a pile of mashed potatoes. Here's something to piss you off: when a parasite isn't moving it's real effects! When it isn't moving, IT'S FLIPPING CGI! ASYLUM STYLE CGI! I thought the directors were special effects masters! But I guess it's the producers fault, for one had no experience producing and the other had produced terrible CGI.<br /><br />I will admit that the PredAlien (terrible name,) has a really cool design. IT'S TOO BAD WE NEVER GET AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AT IT! The characters are idiotic, the storyline is idiotic, the lighting is idiotic, the makers of the film are idiotic, it is non-attention grabbing and the dialogue is idiotic! @#$%! This movie gets a 1.5/5!</p></body></html>

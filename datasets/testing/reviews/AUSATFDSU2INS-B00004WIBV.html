<meta name="summary" content="The dark genius of Tim Burton"></head><body><p>In the middle of the mist we hear a horse ride, accelerated rhythm, until the fog dissipates and we see an impressive figure, his presence irradiates pure evil, his arm is ready to take another head.<br /><br />Tim Burton's back to the macabre.<br /><br />Gothic, colorful and vampire-ish, Sleepy Hollow shows us the vision of this extravagant director about Washington Irving's tale. It's a melodramatic story about the quarrel between intellect and emotion, pragmatism and mysticism, science and superstition.<br /><br />The sleek Constable Ichabod Crane puts science above everything. His controversial brainstorms take him to investigate a series of murders committed in the local community of Sleepy Hollow. Four people have been beheaded and everyone thinks the murderer is a headless horseman, a fierce war mercenary that came from the dead to take his vengeance.<br /><br />Ichabod will try to rationalize the facts, while he struggles to resist the charms of Katrina Van Tassel, only to reach the inevitable conclusion: that there is not a logical explanation for the murders.<br /><br />Visually stunning, Sleepy Hollow has some elements from the horror genre. A demonic villain that terrorizes a town. But it's also a gothic adventure with a pale hero running through skeletal trees to rescue his damsel in distress. That the hero is in more danger that the damsel is one of the great twists in this film.<br /><br />As Ichabod Crane, Johnny Depp is an exquisite mix of neurosis, extravagances, manias and quirkiness. He's the antithesis of the classical hero, a coward with a brilliant mind but no experience in how to defeat an evil ghost. He's funny without being clowny.<br /><br />Alongside him, there's a cast of excellent actors that help recreate Burton's story.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow is a little over the top in his drama management and his approximation to comedy. But still, is a movie that achieves to recreate a world of fantasy with great realism, thanks to the skills of those who imagined an 18 century village that it could well be hell's portal.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow also confirms that Burton continues to ride on the dark side of creativity, hearing his own voices. In the movies, that's an enough excuse to feel forever grateful.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies ever..."></head><body><p>This is Sinatra's best movie.  There is a great deal of folklore that's grown up around this.  For the record, NO it wasn't taken out of distribution because of the Kennedy assassination: Frank Sinatra owned the rights and withdrew it after a feud with United Artists - eventually forgetting he owned it and was preventing his own best work from being shown.<br /><br />This is another great film the way they used to make them.  The black & white photography is beautiful.  Frank Sinatra plays Ben Marco, a Korean War vet who is plagued by the same nightmare night after night.  Soon, he discovers his whole platoon is having the same nightmare that he is.  The standout performance is Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Iselin - the mother of a brainwashed assassin.<br /><br />Everything about this film is spot-on - the performances, the direction by John Frankenheimer, and the script by George Axelrod.  It is the best, scariest political thriller ever made and it is just as timely as ever.  Watch the interview with Sinatra and Frankenheimer included as a bonus feature</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A pointless convoluted mess of a plot"></head><body><p>Just because a film is filled to the brim with awesome action sequences does not excuse it from having an actual plot. Live Free or Die Hard, the 4th kinda sorta but not really sequel is all action and no plausable story line. Though far better than the 2nd sequel, it doesn't even begin to compare to the first movie, or even the surprisingly cool Die Hard With a Vengeance. Those had an actual plot that you can follow even though they were a tad on the far-fetched side.<br /><br />For this movie, you pretty much have to suspend all belief and sort of go with the flow, if you like that kind of thing. There is nothing wrong with mindless violence in films; we see it all the time. But it's hard to enjoy a film if you are scratching your head over the ridiculous story line.<br /><br />The one good thing about this film is Justin Long. He's a funny nerdy type of character and it completely works. Bruce Willis is laid back and fits into his role nicely, but it really is the same old thing over again. Also, the whole subplot with his daughter is pointless AND when exactly did he have a kid? No mention of it was ever made in the third one and she seems to be at least seventeen. It's been only thirteen years since the last one came out, and he wasn't that young back then. It just seemed sort of weird watching it.<br /><br />Though the plot is ridiculous and confusing, it is also very predictable. There is nothing new or exciting; it really is the same old thing you've probably seen a million times over. I would definetely skip this one and check out D H 1& 3 instead.</p></body></html>

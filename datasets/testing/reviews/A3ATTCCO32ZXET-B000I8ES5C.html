No, scratch that; how about a clever martial arts cartoon fleshed out with live action and a little CGI?  As soon as I saw this I realized that I've been unconsciously yearning for this weird combination of the ridiculous and the impressive. Kung Fu Hustle is long overdue.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hustle is a bona fide comedy.  It has an original plot, action, and jokes that don't reference any other particular movie.  What's more, it would seem that filmmakers have finally discovered how to use CGI to simulate cartoon action in a live action movie (who even knew that would ever  be called for? And yet...).  This is an entirely new category of martial arts film, deserving of its own evaluation apart from spoofs like Kung Pow.<br /><br />The story is basically the universal archetype of poor people being oppressed by a powerful but corrupt man, and an unlikely hero emerging out of nowhere to save the day.  That much is old hat, I will admit.  And I'm not sure that I'd go so far as to say that the entire film is good, because it does drag on in spots.  On the whole, though, I found myself enjoying it and being continually surprised by the irreverent tone, the sometimes silly humor and the very entertaining fight scenes.<br /><br />If you like your kung fu movies straight and serious, this one might seem silly.  But I think that's its odd charm, so I will give it a solid four stars and call it a good pick for a contrarian in a lighter mood.  If that's you, then you're probably a Warner Bros. fan, too and you will be able to appreciate Kung Fu Hustle.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka merribelle</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DIE HARD IS STILL ALIVE AND WELL! 4 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>The original 'Die Hard' film is the quintessential action movie. The first two sequels are very entertaining, but couldn't possibly live up to the original. 'Live Free or Die Hard' is a worthy entry in the series and the best since the original. Willis is in fine form and Justin Long proves he can hold his own. Fantastic action sequences and a tight story line will keep you on edge from beginning to end. The single disc unrated release has the theatrical release included as well as the unrated version. There is enough extra stuff on this one to keep me happy, but a two disc is available for "DIE HARD" super-fans. ;-b</p></body></html>

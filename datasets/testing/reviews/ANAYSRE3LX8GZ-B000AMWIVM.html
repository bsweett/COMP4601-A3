But, it's actually nothing like that surprisingly. This is a fresh feel to a horror movie, probably seen before, but hasn't been done to death over the past few years.<br /><br />The movie starts off a bit confusing, but you pick up on whats going on. It starts off showing the two main actors, already stuck in their prison that the villain has placed them in. They're locked in chains, have no idea how they got there and don't know what is going on. As it goes on, they find these sort of clues, and have to solve little riddles or something while a clock is running down. If they run out of time, pay the consequences. Also it follows a story of an ex-cop played by Danny Glover who is on the hunt for the "Jigsaw" killer. During the movie there are flashbacks to things the main actors are remembering from their pasts, trying to remember how they got into the situation they are in, what they had heard, who they thought it was, who they where etc...<br /><br />It's hard to say anything really without giving away the whole deal. So I'll just say, this an interesting movie because every-time you think you predict something, you don't! Plus it's interesting that the killers actions aren't murder, he puts his victim in a situation where if they want to live, they must make sacrifices to stay alive.</p></body></html>

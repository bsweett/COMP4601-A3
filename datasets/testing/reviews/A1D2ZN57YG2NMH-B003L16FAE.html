<meta name="summary" content="Schwarzenegger's Best Film!"></head><body><p>This is an amazing film. The tension is completely covincing, in fact, this is one of the rare films that had my heart pumping big time. It seems that after seeing enough creature-action thriller films, you become desensatized to the thrill, that's why this film shocked me so much. Everything from the heavy action, to that onimous drumbeat that means, "predator is near" screamed complete surrender.<br /><br />If you are a Schwarzenegger fan, or just like really good movies, see this.<br /><br />PS<br /><br />Don't see this if you're the least bit squeemish, as some of the violence tops Saving Private Ryan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Deplorable characters just prevent this film from working"></head><body><p>After watching this film I was in a state of ambivalence the likes of which I had not seen in a long time.  Closer featured four actors at the top of their game, wonderful dialogue, a fairly downbeat ending (I rather like downbeat endings- they're so much more powerful than light and happy ones), some very amusing scenes, and a very novel approach to a relationship movie.  However, I did not like the film's structure, feeling that by flashing forward over so many months a lot was left off the table.  While I recognize that this tactic could be seen by some as adding to the narrative instead of detracting from it, I felt it was far more of a hindrance than a help.  Nonetheless, it was not the jumpy trajectory that really got to me, it was the fact that each one of the four main characters was a truly miserable person.  Although the characters start out as relative innocents, in a few scenes all of them have become in turn vapid, power-crazed, masochistic, obsessive, foul, cheating, and low.  At the end all four are despicable and not worthy of the audience's time.  Now this could still be a compelling picture and to some degree it is, but the movie is not really about their plummet to deplorability (indeed some of the characters begin that trip in the second sequence).  Instead of judging its characters the movie merely observes their interactions, and herein lies my principle complaint.  Was Closer boring?  No, not at all.  Was it involving, well-acted and well-directed?  Yes, absolutely.  Was it an enjoyable film? No, it was not, hence my two and a half star (out of four) rating.  If Amazon allowed me to give 3.5's this would have earned one, but I cannot award give Closer 4 stars in all good conscience.  **1/2</p></body></html>

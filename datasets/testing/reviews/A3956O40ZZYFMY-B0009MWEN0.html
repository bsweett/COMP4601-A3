<meta name="summary" content="THE excuse to buy a blu ray player"></head><body><p>This movie is a hoot!!! It is also probably THE greatest reason to buy into the blu ray system. I needed a shower after watching this movie because I actually felt like I had been knee deep in giant bug guts for 2+ hours when it was over. GREAT EXPERIENCE that could only be experienced with Blu Ray!!<br />There are a lot of other movies that you will just plain miss out on way too much without the superior video and audio quality of Blu Ray. If you dont believe me, check out a system with this movie then watch the same movie on standard DVD......night and day difference!!!!</p></body></html>

It was also a bit nostalgic, as it may be the first remake of a film that I saw in theaters in its original release.<br /><br />The Amityville Horror is a famous bit of American pop-culture.  It is supposedly based on a true story.  The truth: Butch DeFeo murdered his entire family in their house in Amityville.  The next residents - the Lutzes - fled the house after 28 days, claiming that it was haunted.  But - according to Snopes.com, which has a great article - it was all a hoax.  It doesn't matter - it was made into a bestselling book and a successful haunted house movie.<br /><br />The most interesting thing is the way the two Amityville movies epitomize the different styles of moviemaking.  The original film was not a great movie - it is a bit creaky and clich&eacute;-ridden.  However, it is certainly not an awful film - Stephen King discusses it at length in his wonderful non-fiction book, Dance Macabre.  It did have good performances from James Brolin, Margot Kidder, and Rod Steiger.  It had creepy theme-music and - most memorably - that house with windows for eyes.<br /><br />Back then, the emphasis was on character-development and story.  Now, the emphasis is on making a slick-looking picture.  We don't waste that much time on back-story and character-development anymore - we go for economy.  The movie doesn't take much time getting the family into the house and having weird things happen.  The family is the standard good-but-dysfunctional brood but all semblance of normality goes out the window as George Lutz descends into madness.  The most unbelievable bit of pandering to modern audiences occurs when they hire a babysitter who looks more like a prostitute.<br /><br />Still, I like all the actors - especially Ryan Reynolds as George.  He is mostly a comedic actor who finds himself in action/horror pictures lately.  It is hard to believe him as a suburban contractor since he has the body of a male model and spends most of the movie with his shirt off.  However, I suspect people don't come to this movie for verisimilitude.  I wanted to be entertained and feel nostalgic and I came away satisfied in those respects.</p></body></html>

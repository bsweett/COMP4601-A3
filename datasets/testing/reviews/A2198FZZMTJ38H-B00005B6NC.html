As with &quot;Legend,&quot; I feel that &quot;Pitch Black&quot; begins with an open canvas, which segue into regular tactics and cliches of horror and sci-fi, and then is rescued in the end by a climax that proves to be satisfying (of course, &quot;Urban Legend&quot; does it in a much less appealing manner). I did have my doubts at the beginning, but in the end, I felt that it was a good enough effort to sit through, and even enjoyable in certain places. <p>The film begins, fittingly enough, with a spacecraft crash-landing on a secluded planet where there are three suns that shine multiple colors of brilliant light across dry, arid plains of dirt and rock. The planet itself is never identified, nor is it an important factor in the movie. It merely provides for an eerie and unstable setting that will set the tone for the terror to come, and it does a commendable job in doing so. This is where the filmmakers get to show their stuff as well, leaving the norm of filming techniques and giving us lots of yellow and blue hues to give the sense that the atmosphere is quite uncomfortable. <p>Our group of survivors, assistant captain Fry, a female, and less than ten civilians, begin surveying the terrain in hopes of finding water and nutrition to live off of until they can safely make it off the planet's surface. The intrical character of the film is Riddick, a muscle-bound prisoner whom no one trusts until things begin to get intense. One of the group members is mysteriously killed, and further prying leads to the discovery of a small abandoned town, where a 3D diagram tells them that an eclipse is about to take place, bringing with it the thousands of carnivorous creatures that fear light. As the group searches their crippled ship for supplies to make it to the abandoned ship in the ghost town, the realization comes over them that they must face their greatest fear without even being able to see it. <p>The first thing that needs to be discussed is Riddick's character, who is played quite well by actor Vin Diesel, a man who could match muscles with Schwarzenegger and wit with Eastwood. The script sets up his personality so that we never know when to trust him, or if we'll ever be able to. He went to jail for murder, and he shows no remorse for the crime yet neither does he express a need to rehash the events of his past. He is the typical macho man who has a hidden soft side. This makes it much more interesting, because he is the only way for the group to see where they are going (his eyes were altered by a prison mate to take on a sheen which allows him to see in absolute darkness). His swarthy looks will keep the female fans swooning while his way with words and quick reflexes will intrigue the major audience of sci-fi buffs. <p>The movie's structure, as I said before, tends to dwindle in the middle of the film. After the lights go out, the intensity does pick up, but for some reason, I just was not as involved in this section of the story as I felt I should be, or as I usually am with movies of this sort. It seems like there could've been a little more intensity to the entire sequence of events, which involves the group's treck across the darkened terrain to the working vessel in the abandoned town. I think one of the ruinous factors of this section, and the most important, was the predictability factor. It was easy for me to tell who was going to lose their life next because the movie sets it up by developing certain character's personalities more than others, and there you have it. Then there's the old cliche where something you do in the beginning of the movie comes back to haunt you. In this case, it has to do with Fry, who was willing to save herself in the beginning by sending everyone else into oblivion while trying to land her spacecraft. This is revealed, and there is an argument among the group about the next course of action and who's in charge, but it doesn't tie up too much of the running time. <p>However, the movie is bookended, so to speak, by a fascinating beginning and a pleasantly satisfying ending that makes the movie work. The beginning of the film really gives us the feeling of isolation and loneliness in the vast universe, and we get the feeling that even though the group is together, they are so much more apart from the rest of the universe. While the special effects employed in creating the creatures leave much to be desired, the effects used for the beginning third are superb. One shot that sticks out in the mind is the shots of the Saturn-like planet elevating on the horizon. It appears massive on screen, making the characters seem small and minute, which is very important. The ending also gives us something to smile about. The predictability ends, and the actions and tactics of the characters, especially Riddick, make the movie worth the trip. Also worth noting is the inner conflict of Riddick, if there even is one going on. You are left with the question of whether or not he has become a changed man after the events of the film, and basically you get to decide. <p>The cast is mostly comprised of unknowns, most of whom die off in the beginning of the movie to leave the higher ranking performers to do the dirty work. Vin Diesel is a marvelous action hero/villian, and he really brings to life the uneasiness and intimidation that his character inspires in the rest of the survivors. Radha Mitchell does a commendable job as Fry, who comes off as strong-willed and involved with the events at hand. She doesn't break down or give up in the midst of tumultuous situations, but instead presses on when things get harder. It soon becomes a battle of opinion between her and Riddick, which is quite intriguing to watch. <p>In summation, I entered in the world of &quot;Pitch Black&quot; without much expectation, and left it feeling more surprised than I thought I would. The movie does have its redeeming qualities to rescue it from being a mere two star flick, mostly in the acting and the majority of the story. It's an interesting look, moreso than &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; at the fact that what scares us the most is what we cannot even see.</p></body></html>

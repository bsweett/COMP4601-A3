I did do some time in theater a few years back and that gave me a new respect for them. I must say that this movie musical is done right. Lets start with the songs....right? How good can a musical be without great songs? The songs in Hairspray are fun and catchy and like the movie, fast paced. The cast is very appealing and has the energy to keep this film alive. Travolta is pretty scary looking as the obese Edna but, the charm of the character wins you over. Pfeiffer (50ish)is as hot as ever and plays a villain. The three leads, spunky ever-positive Blonsky, "cutie pie" Bynes and "heartthrob" Efron are perfectly cast. I thought the film was just a little too long but, it is one movie that lives up to the trailers promise of fun! The DVD transfer looks great, with excellent audio and there are many fun extras.</p></body></html>

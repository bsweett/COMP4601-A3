<meta name="summary" content="Not bad, but..."></head><body><p>it is an unnecessary remake of the 1976 film. Lee Remick and Gregory Peck were magical stars and the new "stars" lack their authorothy and star quality.<br /><br />True the killing scenes are inventive, but so what???<br /><br />This is only a reharsh of the not so-old-film and when u don`t have anything NEW to add to a story, why DO IT AT ALL???<br /><br />Liev Schreiber also filled Laurence Harvey`s shoes in The Manchurian Candidate and did a poor job in that 1 also... It`s ok if he wants to be a remake-hero, but it`s nothin`to build a career on....<br /><br />Mia Farrow excells in this 1(naturally 1 thinks of Rosemary Woodhouse and that indeed the Devil did take a hold on her hehehe), but her departure is ridiculous....<br /><br />As a matter of fact.... it doesn`t leave much excitement nor thrills and u  m a y go back and see thr original. As a matter off fact......... DO!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kiosk Rating &lt;1"></head><body><p>Chick flick appealing to guess who for the following reasons:<br />Reasons presented in "Bridesmaids":<br />(1.) Female insecurity showcased with lots, of shopping, eating, swearing and girlfriend breakups.<br />(2.) Women pursuing the perfect marriage but ending up feeling trapped; multiple examples.<br />(3.) Implied sex scenes revealing that it's not uncommon for it not living up to the girl fantasy.<br />(4.) Female mutual jealousy and competitive envy cat fights.<br />(5.) Female bipolar/manic depression alternating between hysterical and slovenly episodes.<br />(6.) Whether showing women social drinking or individually it was all formula stereotypical.<br /><br />Basically, just dumb jokes and even dumber slapstick. It is a bit of a concern that a significant number of Americans look forward to these TV soap-as-film reruns. It's just another in an endless stream of LA/NY rewrites for an established audience. Note; Not that the guys don't have their formula flicks.</p></body></html>

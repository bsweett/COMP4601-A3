<meta name="summary" content="First fresh and innovative movie I've seen in at least a decade!"></head><body><p>I watched the Oscars without having seen Slumdog Millionaires. I thought Hollywood was making too much out of the movie. However, after watching it for myself, I can honestly say this is the first fresh and innovative movie I have seen in at least a decade. It doesn't follow the well-worn Hollywood conventions and stereotypes. The acting is heartwarming, not mushy. The characters take interesting and unexpected twists.<br /><br />The movie also teaches Western audiences (most of whom have never been to the slums of a developing country) about the struggles of life as a "slumdog" without lecturing or moralizing. In fact, at times, the movie turns heartbreaking situations into heartwarming ones. For example, in one scene, a little boy wants to see a famous movie star but is locked in a run-down outhouse, so he runs out of the outhouse, through the waste, and asks for the movie star's autograph while he is covered in poop.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the best movies of the past few years. I certainly hope Danny Boyle makes more great movies like this.</p></body></html>

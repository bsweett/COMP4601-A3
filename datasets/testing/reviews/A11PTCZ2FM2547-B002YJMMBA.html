And does Howard wisely bypass some of the hysterical physical antics Dan Brown makes Harvard Symbologist Robert Langdon suffer through in his nonsensical <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416578749">novel</a>?  Gratefully, yes.  But alas, is the plot just as farfetched, just as out of control, and the ending just as plain numb dumb silly as Mr. Brown's tome?  Unfortunately, yes.  Which makes ANGELS & DEMONS one thrilling ride, but overall it's as lame as a pack mule swimming a mill pond.<br /><br />We're all familiar with the story; suffice it to say Professor Langdon (Tom Hanks, reprising his role from 'The DaVinci Code'), accompanied by his appealing compadre Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer), rushes breathlessly from one Roman locale to another to prevent the murders of four cardinals who are in line to succeed the just-departed Pope; meanwhile a canister of antimatter must be found before it obliterates all of Vatican City.  And who, pray tell, initiated all of this chaos?  The Illuminati!  &lt;&lt;Shudder.>>  Only was it truly the Illuminati, or a desperate plot inside the Vatican to make Catholicism--and religion in general--more essential to mankind?  Only Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (a confused-looking Ewan McGregor) can answer that! This is a movie that rushes at breakneck speed from one depiction of carnage to another until the over-the-top ending has us chuckling under our breaths.  Yes, ANGELS & DEMONS is darn fun to watch, but it's as silly as The Three Stooges in hemp-colored vestments.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.</p></body></html>

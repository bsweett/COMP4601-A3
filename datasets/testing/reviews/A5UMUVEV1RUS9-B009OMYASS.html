If you couldn't get enough of either Saw or Saw II (and are as excited about the upcoming theatrical release of Saw III) then Hostel is right up your alley. What's most shocking are all the reviews here commenting about the nudity at the beginning of the film. You have to keep in mind that the setting is in Amsterdam and people over there are less hung up about nudity. That being said, I think it fits perfectly into the movie. The story follows 3 guy friends around Amsterdam, who head to another town for the women and the prospect of what these women will do...the locals say the women will do ANYTHING and just love American men. The guys go, and sure enough, sexy women abound, taking them out for a night of fun. Everything seems great until the next morning when one of the friends is discovered to have left. The 2 remaining guys try to find their friend but he never returns or calls them back. Even more disturbing, he's sent them a picture from his camera phone saying he's gone home. But things soon get even stranger in this strangeland and to say more would ruin it for anyone else who's been wanting to see this. If gory and gruesome are things you enjoy in a movie, you should not miss Hostel. I was riveted from beginning to end, and I must say I very much liked the ending too. Be prepared though...this is not for the squeamish. You've been warned. A must-see for fans of this genre.</p></body></html>

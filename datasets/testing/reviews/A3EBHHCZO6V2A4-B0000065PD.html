<meta name="summary" content="The Stargate-a Portal through Time&Space"></head><body><p>"Stargate" is a fun film,for all its wacky cheesiness. Kurt Russell stars as a Marine, Jack, who's mourning his wife's death&is suicidal. James Spader stars as the geeky Egyptologist Daniel. The androgynous Jaye Davidson (from "The Crying Game") is Ra,a tyrannical alien who recalls Michael Jackson with his delicate voice&retinue of boys.<br /><br />"Stargate" has an interesting premise. Daniel finds the stargate&thinks it's from outer space. His fellow academics laugh at him.. but it turns out to be a portal to ancient Egypt. There,Ra is lording his power over humans. Daniel romances a native girl (it's not as kinky as Spader's usual ventures,but may be disturbing to some viewers),finds out Ra's true nature,while Jack raises a revolt. Good triumphs (of course). Ra turns out merely to be an evil parasite,somewhat like the fake gods in Star Trek (think of "Who cries for Adonis?")<br /><br />"Stargate" is good cheesy fun. See how the Stargate series originated. Watch the geek get the girl&walk like an Egyptian!</p></body></html>

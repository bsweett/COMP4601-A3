Little as measured by his talent compared to others who have held the office.  But more than that, the tragedy of George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, is a direct result of a sociopathic personality that this film was not able to fully capture.<br /><br />That personality belonged and belongs to Dick Cheney, Bush's prince of darkness-like vice president, a man who was able to manipulate W. as a puppeteer might manipulate a puppet by playing on W.'s vanity and insecurities, and on his vainglorious lust to outdo his father and to shine brighter than his brother Jed.<br /><br />Or is it George W. himself who has the sociopathic personality?  How can you approve the torture of people to find a justification to invade another country knowing full well that thousands of people will die because of your actions?  Can you tell yourself you are bringing democracy to another land when in your heart of hearts you know that your motive is to be able to run for reelection as a wartime president or one who has just won a war and thereby upstage your father who was not reelected?  I think the question of whether George W. was the more manipulated or more the manipulator has not yet been answered.<br /><br />This film is curious in what it shows and where it would not go.  We do not see W. as a boy blowing up frogs with firecrackers.  There is no snorting of cocaine.  We see him as a fraternity pledge at Yale ticking off the names and nicknames of his fellows, but what is missed is the significance of the nicknaming for George W., which is to control others through the threat of demeaning them with an embarrassing tag.  We do see how nicknaming allows him to simplistically regard others, as he calls Cheney "Vice" (yes!) and slaps derogatory names on foreign leaders who fail to come into his war coalition.  But the psychological essence of calling other people names is to boast a personality suffering from a poor self-image.<br /><br />So the 43rd president was simultaneously a vain and self-conscious man acutely aware of his limitations, always working to boast himself up.  He went to all the best private schools, knowing of course that only his father's money and prestige got him in, and of course as a C-student felt his miss-measure against the others.  Yet he is that C-student who became the most powerful man in the world, and yet he had no idea how to use his power.  He became isolated and controlled by the office of the presidency and by those in his inner circle.<br /><br />There is always the danger when making a film focused on a putatively despicable character that you will by showing his all too human attributes and behaviors make him into an anti-hero with whom the audience cannot help but identify.  I'm sure Oliver Stone was aware of this trap, but nevertheless he fell into it.  We see George W. on the John, watching ballgames on TV, in domestic embrace with his wife.  We see his father favoring the other son.  We see George W. fail and fail again, and then we see him give up drinking and become a rousing political success as he helps guide his father's winning campaign for the presidency, as he wins the governorship of Texas and as he becomes president of the United States.  In some ways--at least as far as intelligence and compromised morality goes--he rose from greater depths than perhaps any other American president.<br /><br />But of course without the intervention of his father and being the son of a powerful man, George W. would probably have amounted to little.  And so his triumph in becoming the 43rd president is tainted by the full knowledge that, as this film makes clear, he couldn't have done it without his father's influence and his father's name.<br /><br />The real truth of the phenomenon that is George W. Bush lies not in him or the political dynasty he derailed or the shame he brought on America, but in the fact that so many Americans actually voted for him.  He is the product of his times, and these were the times of great moral corruption in America, times in which preemptive war and torture became accepted practice, times in which the Republican Party became the property of people like Karl Rove and Rush Limbaugh, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, Dick Cheney and the neocons, until in 2008 it became a parody of itself with Sarah Palin and Joe the Plumber.<br /><br />Josh Brolin is convincing in capturing the contradictions in W.'s personality while Richard Dreyfuss makes for a surprisingly apt Dick Cheney.  Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush is as pretty as pretty can be, and James Cromwell as the senior Bush is very true to type.  Thandie Newton captured well Condoleezza Rice's quality of quiet, submissive loyalty while being able to keep her hands clean.  The unavoidable weakness of the casting however is that the characters unfortunately do not look enough like the characters we have seen on TV to fool our eyes.<br /><br />The script by Stanley Weiser, who also co-scripted Oliver Stone's Wall Street (1987), and Stone's direction are competent but undistinguished and a bit shallow.  The right way to make this film in my not so humble opinion is to really show us the evil of George W. Bush, the evil that was tragically the man, and the harm that he did to this country and to the people of Iraq, and to show us how America itself, from the Congress to the media to the pulpit and pew, was manipulated and complaisance in bringing about the tragedy.  Instead Stone and Weiser emphasize George W.'s little guy vain personality and the irony of his rise to power.</p></body></html>

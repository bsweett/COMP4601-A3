Ask any normal movie-goer before 1995 who Pixar was, they would have given you a direct blank stare. In fact, unless you were well familiar with animated shorts, you would be hard pressed to find an average Joe who really knew that such an animation facility was in operation. After 1995 and the prodigious success of their first full-length animated venture, Toy Story, Pixar Animation Studios grew with tremendous strength partnering with Walt Disney Pictures in distributing their future animated films. That deal is now in serious question on whether it will be renewed or will result in the parting of the two studios. On Disney's side, the executives may be leaning more and more toward giving in to Pixar's demands considering the animation studio's features have brought in a combined $600 million domestically alone and recouping their budgets with each release. This is opposite to several of Disney's animated feature films such as Fantasia 2000, Dinosaur, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire that have failed to meet expectations. What happens with the two studios after this may hinder on the success or failure of Monsters Inc.<p>The story center around the misadventures of two monsters that create havoc in the secret monster city. James P. Sullivan works for Monsters Inc., a company that provides energy for Monstropolis. How do they obtain this energy you ask? By going into the bedrooms of children, scaring the young ones and gathering their screams which power everything from cars to lights. Sulley is the best of the best, thanks in part to his buddy Mike Wazowski who helps him on the scare floor. What's more is that everyone seems to just love the big guy, everyone except Randall Boggs, who continuously attempts to pull ahead of Sulley in the scare numbers only to fail. Everything in Sulley's life seems to be going perfectly, that is until he accidentally lets a small little girl into the monster world. From there, all hell breaks loose. Disney and Pixar once again create a picture perfect story that is filled with humor and heart. If you don't usually cry while watching a movie, you'll be hard pressed to see a dry eye including your own while watching this charming tale.<p>One of the most engaging aspects of Monsters Inc. has to be the vibrant voices behind the delightful, and at times scary, characters. The teaming of Billy Crystal and John Goodman has to be one of the biggest, if not the best, highlights of the film with each actor playing off each other gracefully and showcasing perfect chemistry together within the course of the feature. Steve Buscemi gives an utterly chilling voice-over performance for the slippery and cunning Randall Boggs. The familiar voice, at least for many adults going to see Monsters, brings about much needed sinister-like quality to outweigh the humor and the heart-tugging emotions that might have over-flooded the feature had the character not been added.<p>Overall, Monsters Inc. serves as a perfect example of the blending of intensity, humor, and heart so perfectly, it could only have come from the talented artists and writers at Disney and Pixar. They manage once again to out-due their previous successes including the original Toy Story and its sequel in both quality and storytelling unlike most films which, from film to film, tend to take a step backward. As effective as the feature was, there were moments where the filmmakers try too hard pulling off tear-jerker moments and eventually the emotions become a bit much. The ending to the film was a bit of a disappointment especially after it brings the audience to such an emotional peak as the film draws closer to its finale. What makes the ending more disappointing is that it seems to hint at a possible sequel that could never happen under the current Disney and Pixar agreement. But those squabbles are nothing compared to the overall effectively entertaining humor and visuals from one of the best family features in quite awhile.</p></body></html>

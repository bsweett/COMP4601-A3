Brancato and Michael Ferris<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: McG<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Action / Science Fiction<br />Release Date: 21 May 2009<br /><br />It's fair to say that most everyone has a favorite movie franchise they like to geek-out on. As I am no exception, the Terminator series has always been my favorite. Unfortunately for me, I'll have to pretend Terminator Salvation doesn't exist.<br /><br />The futuristic post-apocalyptic side of this story is indeed long over do; but making a Terminator film without Arnold Schwarzenegger, is like making Jaws without a shark. Throw in the facts that James Cameron walked away from the franchise (that he started, I might add), two films ago; and that this is the first installment to be watered-down to a PG - 13 rating; and it seems absurdly pointless. Nevertheless, the film exists anyway.<br /><br />It's been six years since we left John Connor and Kate Brewster in a fall-out shelter at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You would think the look of the Terminator would only improve with time, but you'd be sadly mistaken. For whatever reason, yet again, a character that was visually perfected years ago (1984), has now shown up computer generated.<br /><br />I ask the redundantly un-answered question again, with a breath of desperate annoyance - WHY? Why does Hollywood continuously feel the need to take amazing characters and transform them into computer generated pieces of garbage? George Lucas did it to his very own Yoda, nearly twenty years after he looked more than real in 1980; so why should I even be surprised anymore? Rumor has it there is to be a remake of Spielberg's classic, Jurassic Park. At first I was excited, but will God actually allow them to do the T-Rex with CGI (computer graphic imagery)? Let's hope not.<br /><br />As if using CGI wasn't bad enough; did they really need to make the new Terminators appear to have some sort of physical birth defect to their face? Why are their heads so small? If you haven't seen the film and don't know what I'm talking about, check out the cover of the single disc DVD. If the filmmakers aren't going to take their own movie seriously, how do they expect us to as audience members?<br /><br />The character of John Connor has not once been played by the same actor in any of the four films. This time, Christian Bale gets a shot, and surprisingly was the worst Connor yet. Bale plays Connor with less human emotion than the Terminators have. And I'm not sure if they began shooting a few scenes of this while he was wrapping up with The Dark Knight; but he randomly has the same annoying scratchy voice he had as Batman! What is the deal?<br /><br />The problem with the Terminator movies is that you really need to have an open mind when it comes to the plot. They ask us to buy that John Connor had his father Kyle Reese sent back through time, to save his mother Sara Connor, from a pesky Terminator. If you go with it, it's a lot of fun. If you stop and dwell on it though, it will give you a splitting headache. For the sake of this review, we'll just go with it.<br /><br />In this one, we are in the future nearly the entire time; with the exception of the first few minutes, where we start back in 2003. We meet a new character named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). Marcus is on death-row. For dark personal reasons to be revealed later in the film, he volunteers the use of his body to research, for Cyberdynde Systems (the company that generated Skynet - a stream of computers that became self aware and created the Terminators, thus causing Judgment Day).<br /><br />From there, we jump to 2018 in the middle of the nuclear holocaust between what few humans remain alive, and the self aware nightmare Skynet. John Connor is the only survivor in an attack and stumbles across Skynet's hidden secret: a massive assembly line of T-800 Terminators. Schwarzenegger's brand, in case you were wondering.<br /><br />Connor delivers the message to his chain of command. They plan on taking Skynet out, based on data that leads them to believe they can stop the hellish machines, with some sort of signal.<br /><br />Where did this signal come from? Who knows? Why didn't they use this signal to begin with instead of the excessive sending back through time drama? Because this is the third sequel and let's face it, they're reaching. Folks, that's the best explanation I have for you.<br /><br />Something I could not figure out for the life of me, no matter how many times I re-round the DVD; was why the character of Marcus goes skipping across a river like a thrown rock. He falls from a bridge that has been blown up (which looked awesome, by the way), and then sure enough, goes skipping down the river, bouncing like a ragdoll. Aside from bad directing and editing, what could have possibly caused this to happen?<br /><br />Also, in the scene with John Connor and Marcus sharing a conversation in the water, everything seems to be hatched out quite nicely between the two of them when Marcus turns to leave. So why on earth does Connor scream at him angrily, "What are you?" Was this accidently placed in the film out of order? On the day when Christian Bale lost his cool with that sound guy, perhaps?<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of the series or not, Sam Worthington will be the most rewarding element the film has to offer you. By now, you surely know him from Avatar (ironically also generated from the mind of James Cameron). He is a true gift to action-movie fans: a guy who can play the butt-kicking hero, while being able to act extraordinarily well. You won't find too many of those.<br /><br />Had it not tried to be a Terminator film, it may have been a little better. The action is intense and the cinematography is breath-taking. We see some really cool new machines that were done very well with CGI. But this only made me question again, why the Terminators looked so horrible.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing part of the film was its ridiculously un-original third act. If you've seen the first two films, then you've already seen the ending to Terminator Salvation.<br /><br />Remember when the T-100 was first frozen and then sent into a vat of hot liquid metal at the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day? Same thing happens to a Terminator in the climax here; only in reverse order. And do you recall in The Terminator, when they had that climatic showdown amidst all of those machines, and Sarah Connor went toe-to-toe with the Terminator; and there was the suspense of the Terminator climbing up the stairs and her having no-where to go? Yeah, well if you don't, it's all here again for you; nearly frame for frame.<br /><br />This may be considered a SPOILER, to some, but I like to think of it as more of a friendly courtesy; to point out that they also CGI'd Arnold's face onto the body of another actor, for a cameo. I guess these filmmakers didn't realize the technology that now exists to digitally reduce wrinkles and make someone look incredibly younger; as used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. They didn't have to make Arnold look like he did in the first two films, either. All they had to do was take off six years; he looked great in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Guys, come on.<br /><br />If I had to guess, they probably did this because they weren't able to get Arnold on-board, with their poor excuse for a script. And of course Arnold would have had to train insanely to get his body back to where it was; as he did for the third film. But if that's the case, then you don't use a shot of Arnold at all, hello! You come up with something else, original. Why do these huge studios and directors insist on settling for crap? Crap may very well be cheaper, but it's not as appealing to the eye.</p></body></html>

Although I have had an oportunity to visit the pyramids in Mexico and Central America and have seen Discovery and History channels specials on Mayas and Aztecs I was always relatively disturbed that the TV specials had a lot of PC (political correctness) control over the production.<br /><br />Apocalyptico is an in your face depiction of the exteremely advance, intelligent and perverted bloodthirsty societies that both the Aztecs and the Mayans really were in their day. If I had any slight disappointment it would be that the city depicted in the movie, the temples, residences and most of all the pyramids were much much smaller than real life. I would guess that they couldn't film in some of the larger well known historical sites and had to build the set themselves. It does not take away from the movie but I only make this comment to emphasize the real horror of the Mayan history.<br /><br />This movie is so violent it's pornographic. The sexual abuse of the women is glossed over in this film, also to it's detriment cause I would guess Gibson probably thought enough with the violence that he will have to deal with never mind any explicit rapes etc.....<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />If you want to understand this culture then read 'Aztec Summer' by Gary Jennings, (not Aztec Bllod by the same author  ... the book is a dog). This is a novel with the most fabulously and for the most part historically correct depiction of the Aztecs, and of course to the same extent the Maya and their bloothirsty rituals.<br /><br />To give you an understanding, as you watch the sacrifices at the Mayan temple in this movie, the Aztecs did the same sacrifices when they conquered warring armies that they actually were killing people 24 hours a day for periods of more than 10 years!<br /><br />Finally, for those of us that have visual memories, the chase and the hunt does not diminish the impression of the sacrifices. It most certainly is not a film for the weak of heart or young people, and by that I meand under 30 for goodenss sakes.[...]</p></body></html>

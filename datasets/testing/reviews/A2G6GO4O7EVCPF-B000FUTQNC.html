<meta name="summary" content="Harrison Ford still kicks butt but Firewall is basically what you've seen too many times before"></head><body><p>Harrison Ford (Hollywood Homicide, Star Wars: A New Hope) plays Jack Stanfield who is the big CEO of the bank and whose world turns upside down when Bill Cox, played Paul Bettany (The Reckoning, upcoming Da Vinci Code) in a disappointing performance, and some of his men, take hostage Ford's wife, played by Virginia Madsen (Sideways, Candyman), his daughter, played by Carly Schroeder (Mean Creek) and his son, played by Jimmy Bennett (Hostage, Everwood). I guess Bettany wants Ford to hack into his own system so that he can steal some money and wire it to his offshore accountants and if Ford doesnt cooperate, what will happen? I dont know, I guess it's the old trick in the book, threaten to kill the family. Bascially it all leads up to a showdown between the badguy and the good guy. Predictable, sometimes really cheesy and hey, when havent you seen this? Also starring Robert Patrick (Walk The Line, The X-Files), Alan Arkin (The Jerky Boys Movie, Wait Until Dark), Robert Forster (Jackie Brown, Mulholland Dr.), Vince Vieluf (Rat Race, Grind) and Mary Lynn Rajskub (Fox's 24). Harrison Ford does his usual Air Force One routine here, though he doesnt say "Get off my plane!", he says "You wont get a dime!"...the man must of had serious backaches after those figh scenes...especially at the end.</p></body></html>

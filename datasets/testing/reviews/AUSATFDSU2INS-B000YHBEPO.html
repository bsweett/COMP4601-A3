<meta name="summary" content="Intolerable mission"></head><body><p>The mission, should you decide to accept it, is to read a completely negative review of this movie.<br /><br />Before, I need to make clear that I enjoy action movies a lot, that I enjoy the explosions, the frantic action scenes, the villains, heroes and any other accessory that contains a film of this kind. Likewise, it's important to emphasize that I enjoyed enormously the "prequels" of Mission Impossible, and for that very same reason, I have to explain why Mission Impossible III did not fulfill my expectations.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. YES, it has lots of action, special effects and above all, it has Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain.  The problem in this movie falls in the absurd turn that the plot took.<br /><br />Mission Impossible used to be a series where a group of extraordinarily gifted secret agents were assigned to carry out "impossible" missions, with state-of-the-art technological tricks, disguises, and the possibility that always they were about of be discovered.<br /><br />Though MI-I and MI-II suppressed at  the most the "group of agents" concept and centered all the action in only one, Mr. Ethan Hunt, we could accepted that once again it was Hunt the leader of this new mission.<br /><br />But when the "supposed" mission revolves around the hero romantic relationship, I would expect that at least such relation had some sense. On the contrary, is a relationship based on lies, and it doesn't have enough dramatic weight for us to value the faith of these two people.<br /><br />It would appear the Tom Cruise can't allow the prospect of sharing scenes with other co-starts that could offer anything else more than his worn out smiles, facial expressions and tiresome acrobatics.<br /><br />JJ Abrams (Lost), in his debut on the big screen, directs the movie as if it was a 2-hour Alias episode, cluttered and clumsy, presenting an elaborate plot without substance, always with a fast pace, descending the rhythm only when Hoffman is on the screen.<br /><br />And it's thanks to the unquestionable qualities of Hoffman as a performer that MI-III is not a total fiasco.  Many people will stay astonished with the explosions, the frenetic helicopters pursuits, the disguises, the jumps from skyscrapers and the explosive action scenes. Others will get out of the theater mentally bored and exhausted after expending 2 hours watching what should had been more of than the same old action thing, but worse.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Remembering This"></head><body><p>In the various special features included in this package, you'll hear the assertion (over and over again) that one of the reasons for CASABLANCA's greatness is that the actors themselves (as well as director Michael Curtiz) were filming pretty much on the fly, with no idea what tomorrow's shoot would entail or how the darn thing was going to end.  Makes sense, I suppose.  If the actors were as tentative and uncertain about the outcome as the characters they portrayed, it could only add to the authenticity, right?<br /><br />Well, of course, and I don't doubt the veracity of this story really, but when you think about it, COULD this story really have ended any other way?  Could Rick and Ilsa really have suddenly announce to Victor Laszlo that THEIR (Riok and Ilsa's) personal desires really did "amount to more than a hill of beans in this crazy world."  Would they ever have been so selfish and crass as to add, "So you just board the plane, Vic old boy and vamoose on out to Lisbon.  After all, you've got your work, your cursed integrity and principles, and you sing a mean version of "The Marseillaise," so take some satisfaction in your mission and leave us lovebirds alone.  We've always had Paris, and now we'll have Casablanca too." In 1942? Not bloody likely.<br /><br />That point aside,  film scholars and critics have every reason to hail CASABLANCA as one of the all-time greats.  It does what the best movies always have done: tells a great story with wit, sophistication, a sense of intrigue, an expression nobility--and doesn't stint on the romance.  It's got it all, and even better, it's totally unpretentious.  Whether or not Bogart and Bergman knew where the story was headed, it's almost certainly true that they did not know how good a movie they were making.  Maybe Curtiz did: he was framing all those gorgeous shots after all, but I believe Bergman's film critic daughter Pia Lindstrom when she says her mother was absolutely baffled by fans' comments for years afterward that they just loved her CASABLANCA.  Though Bergman was never anything less than professional, it's reported that throughout the shooting, the actress was obsessing about her next big part in the more "literary" (and therefore more prestigious) FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS.  She never anticipated that Ilsa in CASABLANCA would become her signature role.<br /><br />And it's certainly one of Bogart's greatest too.  As the special feature on Bogie indicates, he was an actor thoroughly dedicated to his profession, and while his range may have been limited (or his casting options "typed") by this point in his career, audiences knew that he was much more than just a screen tough guy.  His Rick Blaine is indeed evert bit the romantic and the idealist that the cheerfully corrupt police captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) accuses him of being.  We scarcely need Renault to tell us that, however.  If ever there was a sensitive sould hiding under a mask of worldly cynicism it's got to be Rick--and if there was ever an actor capable of embodying those elements (and all the shades in between) it was Bogart.<br /><br />It's also interesting how much commentary there is in the features about how much an ensemble player Bogart really was.  It's hard to think of a more individualistic screen presence than Humphrey Bogart: yet it's also true that his best roles are in films with brilliant supporting players.  Aside from the aforementioned Bergman and Rains (who is perfect as the prefect),  there are great (co-)star turns by Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre (must have felt like old home week after MALTESE FALCON), Conrad Veidt and the solid, stolid Paul Henreid as Victor Lazlo.<br /><br />The qualified ending is happy enough...for wartime.  Everybody gets to feel good about themselves in the end, as even Renault finds he's capable of something like nobility after all.  About the only people who lose out in the end are bad guy Nazi Major Strasser (Veidt)--and oh yeah, those "USUAL SUSPECTS."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Is It True that Windex Can Heal Any Cut?"></head><body><p>Since this movie looked so good in the coming attractions, off I went to see it asap. VERY funny! It's a sort of "Moonstruck" about Greek-Americans--folk ways and family relationships exhibited for all to see. <p>Toula has always been self-concious about her Greek heritage, but can't seem to find a way out. She lives at home and works in the family restaurant, Dancing Zorba. Both her aunt (Angela Martin) and her mother (Lanie Kazan)are flamboyant women making vats of food. Michael Constantine is a stand-out as the father who believes that any cut can be treated with Windex (I thought it was very funny that no matter where you looked in the house, there was a bottle of Windex lurking somewhere). And then, out of the blue, into Toula's life comes Ian Miller, a sort of lite Kevin Sorbo. In time, she bucks her father's resistance and takes a computer class at a nearby college, and before you know it, in go the contact lenses and on come the lots more attractive wardrobe, so that the next time she sees that Ian guy, she's prepared. From there, you can figure out what going to happen: after all, it IS called "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", isn't it?  <p>My only criticism about the movie would be its lack of conflict. I kept expecting Toula to have a fight with her fiance Ian, but this never happened. I mean, even Liz Taylor had a fight with her fiance in "Father of the Bride"! <p>But that's a relatively small quibble for such a funny movie. Go take in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and have yourself a good laugh.</p></body></html>

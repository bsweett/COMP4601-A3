<meta name="summary" content="Did you know that your $120 asthma inhaler costs a Cuban $.05???"></head><body><p>Does the U.S. have some of the worst health care in the world? Could it be that the "land of the free" ranks #37 concerning health care just above Slovenia? Do insurance companies "weed out" those that they predetermine to not cover? Have important politicians, who a few years back supported a move to socialized medicine in this country,been "bought" in order to have this put on the back burner? Why am I paying a $30 copay for the same medicine that last year cost me $10??? Why do some people get approved for medical procedures and others do not? Thank you Michael Moore for finally bringing these questions to the attention of a sleeping American public. If his facts are only 50% correct, then we are still in big trouble and deserve alot of explanation. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS are both held equally responsible for this mess in Michael Moore's film, so no one should, whatever their politics,  avoid seeing this film.This is good information that equally effects all of us as Americans.Yes, I laughed and I cried as well.Yes I was entertained. Ultimately I left feeling low and concerned. I do have health coverage and stay at a dead-end job because of it,too.It would be nice to have this paid for so that I could do what I really wanted to do.As you get older in the U.S. you realize that benefits, for what they are, are essential to survival.How sad for us!God help anyone who has a catastrophic illness with no coverage. It's frightening.Are other countries panaceas? Watch the film and you decide!<br /><br />Two great movies to follow up SICKO would be  1990's THE DOCTOR with William Hurt and BEAUTIFUL DREAMERS with Colm Feore.These films were released as socialized medicine was becoming an issue under Clinton.</p></body></html>

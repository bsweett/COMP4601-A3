<meta name="summary" content="Good, not great"></head><body><p>Chicago is the story of a young woman (Renee Zellweger)who kills her lover (she is married) and seems doomed to die on Murderer's Row. While in the slammer, she hears about and eventually gets a lawyer (Richard Gere)to help her get out.  The lawyer is famous for freeing guilty women who have walked in her shoes before.<p>As musicals go, it's just ok.  I can't believe it got all the hype it received including best picture.  The characters are all interesting, especially Queen Latifah, who makes the most of a small role.  Gere and Zellweger are their usual passable selves, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, as another convicted killer looking for a way out also does things pretty well.<p>The problem is, that when musicals insist on making everything musical, it gets in the way.  I swear, not one important point is spoken in this film, it's all sung.  That gets on my nerves.  Since the performances are good, not great and the story is average at best, this film would appeal to only real musical fans, or fans of the performers.  Since I fall into neither category, it was average for me.</p></body></html>

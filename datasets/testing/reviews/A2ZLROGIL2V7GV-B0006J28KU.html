<meta name="summary" content="A Crime Saga to Remember"></head><body><p>Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are two of my favorite actors.  So when I found out that they would be in a movie together, I was very excited to see it.  "Heat" is a crime saga masterpiece that mixes drama and film noir together.  Combine all of those elements together and you get one hell of a movie.<br /><br />Pacino plays a L.A. detective who is obsessed with his job.  He has dedicated his life to put away every single criminal in the state.  Much so that he has become obsessed with his job.  De Niro plays a criminal who loves to go on heists.  A professional he is, and he never gets caught.  Soon, the two's lives collide with each other and all hell breaks out.  Pacino becomes obsessed with catching De Niro.  He will not rest until he is locked up.<br /><br />That is only half of the story.  There are many stories in this crime drama that interact with each other.  Other great actors in this film include Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, and many more.  Every character is unique in his or her way.<br /><br />The director/writer does an excellent job of making us feel sympathy for the characters, even the bad ones.  He has created a very dark and gloomy world in which nothing is certain.  Problems lurk around every corner, ready to destroy each person.  Don't be mistaken, this isn't an action flick.  This is more of a film noir if anything.  It's dark, the tone is somber, and it doesn't have the happiest ending.  Although there is a bank heist scene in the movie that has to be one of the best action sequences in a long time.<br /><br />As much as I love Robert De Niro, and he does a great job portraying his character, Pacino steals the show.  It's one of his best roles in recent years.  He's vulgar, rude, offensive, and short-tempered.  But, he also has a heart, and you get to see that as the movie progresses.  As serious as his character is supposed to be, he has some of the funniest lines you will ever hear him say.  He definitely wins "best actor" in my book.<br /><br />Again, this isn't an action film.  It is very long (almost three hours), and it is very story oriented.  The film concentrates on character development the most.  This is a great film that realistically portrays these kinds of characters.  This is a movie about choices and consequences, and you're not exactly sure how the movie will end.  A very good movie that should've received more recognition.<br /><br />P.S.  I haven't had the chance to check out the special features on this DVD.  From what I remember, there isn't too many.  But that would be because the movie is so long, and it's all on one side.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the most original horror movies ever"></head><body><p>The world population has been infected by a disease that turns people into flesh eating zombies. Four humans have decided to escape the plague by escaping in a helicopter. They end up landing at a zombie infested shopping  mall and its up to them to use the proper survival tatics to stay alive.  This is actually a horror movie with  a plot, not just some gore loaded  splatter movie. Even if your not a horror movie fan, this one might  actually appeal to you, because it has a dramatic mood to it. Its actually  horror mixed with adventure and drama. Written and Directed by George A.  Romero (Night of the Living Dead).</p></body></html>

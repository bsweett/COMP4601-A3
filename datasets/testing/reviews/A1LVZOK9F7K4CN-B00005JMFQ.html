As it makes perfectly clear in the beginning, the premise of this movie is that "love actually is all around."  Nowadays, cynicism is too often confused with wisdom, and "independent" movies that go for the cheap "unhappy" ending are really just cheating the audience.  In the movie, as in life, the characters care about being happy and are ready to put in the work to achieve happiness.<p>There are a lot of stories going on here, so we never delve that deeply into any one of the characters.  It may be simply an over-ambitious plot exercise, but I think it succeeds more than it fails.  I sat through the movie with a dopey grin on my face and I was never bored.  The only story-line that didn't pan out for me was the one concerning Laura Linney - but I won't spoil it.<p>This is a sweet, funny, life-affirming film and very entertaining.</p></body></html>

Why neglected, you ask? Because, thanks in large part to its stylistic tricks and the presence of Danny Elfman, ask ten fans of the movie who directed it, and you'll get nine people who say "Tim Burton." (Burton was actually the writer of the story upon which the movie is based, after a brilliant adaptation by Michael McDowell.) There can be little doubt that Burton had a profound influence on Selick, given his later work, but Selick has proven himself quite capable of standing on his own. Here, he partners up with another dark-fantasy great, Neil Gaiman, for an adaptation of one of Gaiman's finest novels, Coraline. And I have to say, this is the best film I saw on the big screen since El Laberinto del Fauno. Selick, who also wrote the screen adaptation, nails Gaiman's book in a way I wasn't sure could be done.<br /><br />Plot: Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) and her family move to a spooky old boardinghouse in the middle of nowhere thanks to her mother (voice of Teri Hatcher)'s new writing assignment. While she does make a tentative new friend, the nerdy Wybie (voice of The Happening's Robert Bailey Jr.), she's roundly unsatisfied with her home life, and wishes she could find something better. That night, she discovers a tunnel into an alternate dimension, where she meets analogues of her mother and father (voice of Daily Show regular John Hodgman) who seem to have no interest other than pleasing her. The only other denizen of the house who can travel between the two worlds is a cat (voice of Keith David), who cautions Coraline that not all is as it seems. Coraline is willing to forego warnings for cake, but with the help of some of the house's more eccentric inhabitants, Coraline discovers that not all is, in fact, as it seems.<br /><br />The house's other inhabitants are brought to life wonderfully, and with incredible talent (French and Saunders in fine form, Ian McShane), but it's Fanning and Bailey who steal the show here; they bring a magic to these characters that's rare even in live action. I tend to think of voicing animation as the opposite of silent film; rather than having no voice and having to get things across with exaggerated gesture, you have no gesture at all, and have to get things across with voice. Voice, however, is more subtle, and overdoing it can kill a movie (or a series, as anyone who's seen English-dubbed anime series can attest). Fanning has already proven herself an accomplished voice actress, but it's hard to believe this is Bailey's first outing. Good stuff, indeed. Hatcher is right at home playing a desperate housewife, of course, and French and Saunders just do what they do best, and it works. Heck, the whole cast have themselves a great time here, and it shows. It's all backed up with Selick's trademark creepy animation, that works just as well here as it did in The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. (It may be heresy, but I'll note it, at least in passing; the film is currently rated a tenth of a point higher at IMDB than is The Nightmare Before Christmas. Shocking!) As a side note, making Teri Hatcher's character look like, well, Teri Hatcher will be an extra kick for Desperate Housewives fans.<br /><br />In the afterword to the novel, Gaiman notes that while adults are likely to read it as a horror novel, children see it more as an adventure, and tend not to be scared by it. This is one aspect of the book that Selick didn't translate, and my thirteen-year-old daughter (who is rapidly becoming a connoisseur of bad horror films, just like her dad) was extremely creeped out by a few scenes towards the climax of the film. You may want to shoo the younger kiddies out of the room before watching this, but no matter. The adults will be just as charmed by it as the older kids will be. Maybe even more so. ****</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Infectious family fun, weighted down with environmental message"></head><body><p>I guess Children's movies should come with some sort of moral or message.. but does it have to be so heavy handed as it is here..?<br /><br />This is a beautifully rendered and infectiously entertaining movie about an individual finding and recognising their own form of expression -a wonderful moral tale in itself.  The voice cast and animators all do full justice, and the accuracy of the penguins in terms of drawing and animal habits is astonishing.<br /><br />However, on top of this the director (George Miller- Babe, Mad Max) has shoe-horned in a message about mans environmental impact in overfishing.  It too is a good message, but feels oddly forced here.  The final q5 minutes of the movie feel almost from a different story.<br /><br />Rest assured, this is still a thumbs up event, greatly entertaining and with a great soundtrack of well known songs.  What a great idea, using well known songs instead of writing them all for the movie, rather like Moulin Rouge did.<br /><br />Recommended - but I still wish they had not forced one message too many down our throats.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OK for Bond aficionados"></head><body><p>"Die Another Day" is a reasonably entertaining installment in the seemingly endless James Bond series - provided you don't go into the theater expecting too much that is.  This edition boasts an utterly preposterous plot (that goes almost without saying in films of this type), spectacular stunts and special effects (except for one really badly done shot of Bond boogie boarding down an ice floe), cool gizmos and gadgets, and one of the most beautiful Bond girls of all time in the person of none other than Academy Award winner Halle Berry.  Ms. Berry is not the only Oscar-winning actress to lend her talents to this venture, however.  Dame Judi Dench brings her own touch of class to the festivities as Bond's brittle, starchy boss, known only as M (one does get the sense, however, that the British grand dame is doing a bit of slumming appearing in a work of this caliber).<p>Like most Bond flicks, this one runs about a half hour longer than it should.  And one does begin to feel that these films have gone so far over-the-top in their plotting and style that there really isn't a whole lot of humanity left in the series.  That's where Pearce Brosnan comes in.  He provides enough of a down-to-earth quality to help keep the film at least somewhat grounded in reality, which is certainly necessary considering just how cartoonish in nature many of the action scenes are in this picture.  The fact that the North Koreans serve as the arch villains of the story might have lent the film a patina of social relevance were the sociopolitical issues not dealt with in so utterly absurd a way.<p>There is one amusing scene wherein Bond looks with wry disdain at the retinue of  "high tech" spy devices from the past, including many used in the very earliest 007 pictures.  That kind of bemused self-ribbing is all to the good in a film as lightweight in substance as this one.  <p>There are plenty of better films playing out there right now that could certainly use even a smidgen of the box office proceeds that will be generated by this movie, but "Die Another Day" is must viewing for any hardcore fanatic of the Bond called James.</p></body></html>

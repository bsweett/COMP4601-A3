I mean, the filn has only appeared on hundreds of "best-of" lists, been deepyl analyzed by film students across the country, and has been called masterpiece 500x over. So, really what's left to say? Well, I'm a little stuck, but I'm gonna try.<br /><br />When Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" was released in 1958, it was, as most people know, initially a flop. Perhaps it was because of its deep subject matter, it's frank portrayal of sexual obsession, or maybe because it was simply ahead of its time. Whatever the reason, it doesn't matter anymore, as "Vertigo" has stood the test of time to become a defining masterpiece of American cinema.<br /><br />Hitchcock neever worked better behind the camera than he did with this film. Every far shot, closeup, etc. was and is just perfect. The film's plot was definitely somewhat of a sensitive topic, eritten expertly by Alec Coopel & Samuel Taylor. And of course, the performances in this film are superb. As the back cover states, Jimmy Stewart is brilliant as Scotty Ferguson, a San Francisco cop with a deathly fear of heights known as vertigo. And Kim Novak simply smolders in her dual role as Madeline and Judy. Novak deserved an Oscar for her role. Barbara Bel Geedes (who unfortunately left us this past summer) offers strong support as Midge, Scottie's ex. And of course, some of the best scenes ever put on film. The bell tower sequence is up there with the shower scene from "Pyscho", and has been payed homage to millions of time, most notably in Tim Burton's "Batman" (1989).<br /><br />The dvd comes with several extras, including a making off documentary and a beautifully put together booklet. "Vertigo" is a masterpiece that belongs in any dvd collection.</p></body></html>

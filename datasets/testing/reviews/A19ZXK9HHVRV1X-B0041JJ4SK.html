If, however, these topics don`t offend you, then you may find yourself enjoying this raucous, riotous and high-spirited tale of two young potheads who take to the road in pursuit of the world's greatest hamburger.<br /><br />Harold and Kumar are two young men desperate to overcome the burden of their respective ethnic stereotypes.  Harold is a shy, introverted Korean businessman who wants to be anything but a shy, introverted Korean businessman.  Kumar, a young, twenty-three year old Indian, has opted to become a slacker, mainly as a way of rebelling against the future his high-pressured dad has mapped out for him (being an "Indian doctor" like his far-more-ambitious older brother).  One Friday night, bonged out of their minds and desperate to find a way to satisfy their "munchies," Harold and Kumar decide to go on a quest for the stoner's holy grail - White Castle hamburgers, of course.  As they traverse the wilds of northern New Jersey, our two illustrious compatriots undergo a series of bizarre and often surrealistic misadventures that give them a night neither of them will ever forget.<br /><br />As stated before, the humor in "Harold and Kumar" is crass, crude, vulgar and epicene.  It is also clever, good-natured and downright hilarious, with a little satirical bite thrown in from time to time to keep the higher thinkers in the crowd entertained.  John Cho and Kal Penn make a great comic team as Harold and Kumar and the other actors are all fine as well.  Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser) makes an appearance playing himself, showing that he's a game player when it comes to engaging in a little good-natured ribbing at his own expense.<br /><br />Although "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" is not likely to earn the Concerned Parents of America Seal of Approval, that's no reason why the rest of us can't just sit back, buckle up and enjoy the trip.</p></body></html>

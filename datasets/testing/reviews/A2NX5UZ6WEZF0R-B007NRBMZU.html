<meta name="summary" content="Saw both versions- loved them but director's cut better!!"></head><body><p>I first saw BE on video rental, then I watched the director's cut, and the ending was very sad, when she was giving birth and he died. It made me cry. The movie is well acted but the story is very sad and disturbing. I DID NOT LIKE THE PART WHEN THE DOG WAS SET ON FIRE!!!! And whoever did has problems because that was horrible. There is alot of violence in the film, but what do you expect with a rated R version. Amy Smart is a very talented young actress and gives an unforgettable performance as the estranged girlfriend who was abused by her father. Both versions were sad, and both endings, but especially when he has to save everyone by wiping out his own existence by not being born, which the psychic said he was never meant to be alive, a still-born was suppose to be his fate. If you put all the tragedies together, it's a depressing story about fate, and how changing one thing can cause a rift of disaster. I think this is the first serious film Ashton Kutcher has done. I wish that it wasn't so sad and dark.</p></body></html>

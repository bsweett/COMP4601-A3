<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Tale Reimagined..."></head><body><p>1999's "Sleepy Hollow" is Director Tim Burton's excellent reimagining of the classic Washington Irving fairy tale.  Johnny Depp steals the movie as Ichabod Crane, in this version a New York City police constable with new-fangled and unwelcome investigative techniques who is exiled to Sleepy Hollow by an unhappy magistrate (Christopher Lee in a spot-on cameo).  Crane arrives in Sleepy Hollow (authentically portrayed as a post-American Revolution farming community) to find a string of unsolved murders attributed to the headless but ambulatory corpse of a Hessian soldier.<br /><br />Crane finds also a town full of intrigues and mysterious goings-on, which he will patiently unravel with the help of Katrina Van Tassel (nicely played by Christina Ricci) who turns out to have secrets of her own. A solid supporting cast helps carry the movie.<br /><br />Burton lays on an escalating series of horrible murders, each with supernatural overtones, that challenge both the investigative techniques and the rational beliefs of Ichabod Crane.  Each such scene is nicely creepy without overindulging the gore.  As it turns out, a genuine horror has been unleashed in Sleepy Hollow.  The betrayal of the long-deal Hessian is at the heart of his current incarnation as a killer.  Ichabod will have to dealt with his own bitter experience with witchcraft in order to identify the guilty and save the innocent.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to those looking for an entertaining and well-executed update of a classic fairly tale, featuring fine direction and excellent if sometimes campy acting.</p></body></html>

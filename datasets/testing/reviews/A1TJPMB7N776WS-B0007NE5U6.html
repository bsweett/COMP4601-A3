Zellweger is still chipper and a blast as Bridget. It's just that the plot and everything surrounding her is just a bit off.<br /><br />Many scenes, in particular the Skiing sequence, reminds me of a similar one from a 1960's Doris Day movie: which is OK if it is done in the same light, snappy vein, but it isn't... it just falls flat. Humorless.<br /><br />One scene that does work is the fountain scene/fight between Darcy and Daniel. It's silly, awkward and dumb.... but very very funny.<br /><br />But to tell the truth, what we all want to see anyway is some kind of resolution to the Bridget-Darcy-Daniel triangle. Am I right? And we get one...finally. But like life it takes awhile to get there.<br /><br />"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason" is humorous and sometimes even downright funny. But with all the talent involved here, this last of the Bridget Jones movies should of at least been all the things that the first one was: warm, emotional, caring and hilarious.</p></body></html>

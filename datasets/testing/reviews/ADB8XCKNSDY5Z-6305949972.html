The premise is wonderful, the character designs are spectacular, and the animation is beyond marvelous.  But it feels like some of the movie is missing.  It's almost as if the first 30 minutes of the movie was cut out.  The plot is rushed into before the characters have time to develop so there's no chemistry in Jack's romance, which looks like it was practically tossed in at the end.  Maybe if some of the songs were removed there could have been more room for development.  Or perhaps the film could have been made longer (something I almost NEVER recommend but would be okay with here).  The Danny Elfman soundtrack is terrific of course, but it's tough trying to develop character and plot through music alone, especially in a film that's only an hour and sixteen minutes.  I think the attempt to make this into somewhat of a musical was just too ambitious.  I wouldn't rank this as high up as Pee-Wee's Big Adventure or Big Fish where a lot more goes into the development of the protagonist.<br /><br />I still can't believe this movie came out way back in 1993.  Amazing.</p></body></html>

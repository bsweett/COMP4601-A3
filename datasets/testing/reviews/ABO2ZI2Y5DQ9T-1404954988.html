<meta name="summary" content="Decent But Unremarkable Except Paz Vega's Irresistible Charms"></head><body><p>Perhaps it's Adam Sandler that you want to see in `Spanglish,' James L Brooke's culture-clash drama. Yes, Sandler is surprisingly good with understated acting. He is good enough to make us forget his terrible near career-killing turn in `Little Nicky,' but let me remind you that this film is one of his recent attempts to undo his traditionally accepted image as comedian doing mainly madcap persona. This is not `The Wedding Singer' and it is meant that way.<br /><br />Young Mexican girl Christina (Shelbie Bruce) recounts how she and her beautiful mother Flor (Paz Vega) arrive at the Clasky Family and their gorgeous house in LA (it's `economy class,' she says), where Flor starts to work as a house keeper for a nervous and obsessive mom Deborah (Tea Leoni). Flor cannot speak English, but the fact is not a big problem among this dysfunctional family - see incredibly patient daddy John (Adam Sandler) first-rate chef so devoted to the family that he cannot say what he should to his nagging wife.<br /><br />Flor is after all a capable housekeeper, and of very affectionate disposition for that matter, so John is gradually attracted to her while to her dismay her daughter Christie is drawn to the rich life of the Clansky Family. Though the film gives some interesting supports, especially from deliciously off-beat comic performance as a retired jazz singer from Cloris Leechan, the budding romance between Sandler and Vega lacks chemistry, and is concluded with unconvincing ending.<br /><br />I know this is a matter of taste, but I found Tea Leoni's acting as the frivolous, self-obsessed mom interesting at first, but her constant one-note yelling and mugging gradually became annoying and irritating as the story went on. The character played by Leoni, who is better in recent `Fun with Dick and Jane,' gets alarmingly close to being monstrous.<br /><br />But if something or somebody should be praised for her freshness, naturalness, and most of all, radiating charms, Paz Vega should be the real star of `Spanglsih,' which, though well-intentioned and sporadically funny, is curiously devoid of the originality, or the quirky charms of the characters Brooks has been good at creating. The film is largely well-acted, and also amusing enough thanks to some of the one-liners, but everything about the characters looks oversimplified. And I totally disagree with the stilted and unnecessarily soapy ending.</p></body></html>

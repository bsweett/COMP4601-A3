<meta name="summary" content="Crowe, Washington, and Scott triumph here"></head><body><p>Russell Crowe proves once again that he is one of the most versatile and chameleon-like actors working these days, this time in a role as a cop trying to bring down a drug kingpin.  Denzel Washington gives a nuanced performance as Frank Lucas, who ran a tremendous drug operation in the 1970s that spanned two continents.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott handles the complex and lengthy tale well, with excellent production values, appropriate music, and a nicely executed ending that gives us a bit more info on the two main characters even after we read subtitles about what became of them.<br /><br />And once again, Crowe is dissed by the Academy, which could have nominated this film instead of Juno or Atonement.  But what else is new?</p></body></html>

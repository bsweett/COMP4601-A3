<meta name="summary" content="A turning point in the Gangster Genre"></head><body><p>Brian DePalma has never been known for his subtlety, and Oliver Stone was just beginning his career as a screen-writer of kerosene soaked volatility. In 1983, when they released the violently over-the-top "Scarface,' a lot of film-goers didn't know what to make of it. Hundreds of F-Words and thousands of gunshots in the life of a Cuban Drug Lord outraged the Cuban community and offended the morally fragile. Yet some 25 years later, Al Pacino's burning portrayal of Tony Montana continues to resonate. And there has not been a Gangster movie made since that doesn't owe to "Scarface's" legacy. Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729725">GoodFellas</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDSW">The Godfather</a>, "Scarface" redefined the way this stlye of movie is made and viewed.<br /><br />Perhaps the bizarre affinity gangster rappers have for this has overwhelmed the actual film's content (dudes, Tony becomes an impotent paranoid man before his inevitable bloody end), but the look of the film is amazing. "Scarface" takes its time and comes to a boil ever so slowly as Tony first lands in "Freedomtown" before he starts to climb to the top. Despite the hype of the violence, much of the actual death and destruction is implies (the infamous chainsaw sequence in particular), and Tony even tries to cling to a certain moral code. Murdering an enemy is fine, but not the enemy's kids.<br /><br />DePalma also sticks to a filmatic elegance, allowing cameras slow-pans and eschewing rapid cut editing, while also infusing the film with stabs of humor. (Personal favorite, the job offer in Frank's car dealership.) The color scheme is strictly tied to its time; colors will make you flashback to old Miami Vice episodes and Giorgi Moroder's score just screams "dated." (However, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000UX4XA">Soundtrack</a> does include one exquisite Debbie Harry single.) Given DePalma's legendary fight with the ratings board over the violence and language, he could have easily clipped the film down from its near three hour running time, but he held his ground and delivered the movie he wanted. Love it or hate it, "Scarface" is a visionary movie that has deservedly left its mark.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gorgeous Blu-Ray of the '82 Theatrical Version"></head><body><p>The old clich&eacute; that you cannot go home again happily doesn't apply to Steven Spielberg's E.T., the 1982 classic that hits Blu-Ray for the first time on October 9th. Right off the bat I can say that the film's HD transfer is beautiful, boasting clear detail, no overt use of DNR, and no color scheme "retweaking" that I could detect.<br /><br />The last time I had seen the film theatrically was in 2002 for its 20th Anniversary re-release -- the ninth time I had seen the movie in theaters, but the first viewing I had on the big screen since E.T. first opened in 1982. At that point, I was not quite eight years old, and my lifelong love for the movies was about to take hold during that magical summer of genre favorites.<br /><br />Watching the film again, as an adult, in 2002 was fascinating - not just because of how well the movie holds up, but in how it captivates children as well as adults, who can watch the film from a different perspective and yet be every bit as moved and spellbound by the story as kids are. I was finally able to see what critics had described in 1982, about how Speilberg's movie works for grown-ups in profound yet subtle ways. Whereas kids primarily identify with Elliott's plight to help E.T. get home, on this viewing I carefully studied the reaction of the other characters in the film, and was in awe of how Spielberg carefully painted every character's nuance in seemingly small background detail so effectively. Specifically, I was moved by how Elliott's older brother (an underrated performance by Robert McNaughton) aids his younger brother and gains his uncompromising trust, and how Peter Coyote's initially-villainous, ultimately sympathetic "Man With The Keys" is essentially Elliott as a grown-up, understanding his emotions and wanting to help the abandoned alien but not knowing how.<br /><br />The movie is told with beautiful economy -- each scene creates and sustains an emotion integral to the characters, or serves to propel the story forward. The sequences with Elliott showing E.T. his room, his Star Wars figures, are so genuine, feel so real, that you forget you are watching a sci-fi fantasy that tugs on your heartstrings. It's the kind of movie that cynics love to bash because it makes them feel emotional, but E.T.'s cinematic virtues are plentiful. The movie is anything but saccharine emotion. It makes you care about Elliott and his family because Spielberg and writer Melissa Mathison make them seem like real people. There aren't any moments early in the film that don't feel like real life, and this timeless quality makes one get past the occasional '80s staple like an Atari 2600 camping out on the top of the family TV.<br /><br />We all know and love the film's operatic ending, but there are scenes throughout E.T. that are subtle and yet every bit as sublime. This is illustrated perfectly in the sequence in which E.T. watches the mother (Dee Wallace) read "Peter Pan" to Gertie (Drew Barrymore), with the creature almost as interested in studying their interaction as he is in Elliott's plan to help him return to the mothership. Henry Thomas' performance is still the greatest juvenile performance I've ever seen, and the sequence in which Elliott says goodbye to E.T. -- whom he believes to be dead -- is as moving as any moment in the entire film.<br /><br />Making all of it work, of course, is John Williams' music, still arguably his finest score for not only its outstanding lyricism, but its unforgettable, symbiotic relationship with the movie itself. From the quiet, poignant cues underscoring Elliott and E.T.'s scenes together - to the glorious finale that says every word in musical terms that Spielberg happily didn't feel the need to spell out with dialogue - Williams' music is E.T. It's another character in the film, punctuating every emotion in a fashion that's as restrained at times as it is powerful at others.<br /><br />It's a marvelous, wonderful film and its Blu-Ray release, coming up early next month, adds to its legacy.<br /><br />Universal's 1080p AVC encoded transfer of E.T. (in its 1982 original release version) is crisply detailed without any obvious noise or DNR filtering; overall, the presentation is sterling, enhancing Allen Daviau's cinematography in a transfer that does justice to the film's '82 theatrical cut. The DTS MA audio is effectively rendered as well, boasting a broad stage for Williams' masterful score.<br /><br />For extra features, the disc adds one new interview with Spielberg and more of John Toll's behind the scenes footage, as well as recycles other extras from the 2002 DVD releases. This unfortunately means that, once again, Laurent Bouzereau's unedited 1990s laserdisc documentary hasn't been included (just a cut-down version is on hand), and it's a strange, notable omission since it contained the only full release of Harrison Ford's deleted appearance as Elliott's school principal - as well as the film's excised ending coda. That those particular scenes have never been screened again outside of that documentary sadly remains a mystery (just a few shots of the Ford scene are included in the "Evolution & Creation of E.T." documentary, with Spielberg talking over them).<br /><br />Here's a specific breakdown of what is included:<br /><br />-Steven Spielberg & E.T. (12 mins., HD): A new conversation with Spielberg on the production of the film, its genesis, the essential component of Melissa Mathison's involvement, and a nice anecdote involving his screening of the film to President Reagan at the White House.<br /><br />-The E.T. Journals (53 mins., SD): This release's other noteworthy new extra is a longer assembly of behind the scenes footage from the production of the picture, much of it shot by future "Braveheart" Oscar winner John Toll. Some of this was included (in various forms) on prior releases, but there's more of it here, presented uncut and without new "talking head" commentary, thanks to Laurent Bouzereau.<br /><br />-Deleted scenes (3 mins., HD): Two deleted scenes, added to the 20th Anniversary re-release, are presented here in HD. Neither is essential to the film and the CGI does seem out of place given the rest of the picture (though it's subdued and well executed), but the brief Halloween bit sets the scene nicely. None of the digitally "reworked" scenes involving the government agents' guns are included - although Spielberg said 10 years ago he wanted the guns removed, apparently he's had a change of heart and prefers to let his original version speak for itself.<br /><br />-A Look Back (37 mins., SD): Retrospective doc compiled for the 2002 home video release, which is essentially a cut-down version of Laurent Bouzereau's '90s laserdisc documentary (which ran more than twice as long).<br /><br />-The Evolution and Creation of E.T. (50 mins., SD): Previously available in the three-disc, more expensive 2002 DVD box-set release, this recounts the production in a lengthier manner than "A Look Back."<br /><br />-The E.T. Reunion (17 mins., SD): The cast reunites with Spielberg in this 17-minute piece from the 2002 DVD package.<br /><br />-The Music of E.T.: A Conversation with John Williams (10 mins., SD): Williams interview from the 2002, three-disc DVD box-set.<br /><br />-The 20th Anniversary Premiere (18 mins., SD): Another previously-released featurette showing John Williams conducting the L.A. Philharmonic at the Shrine Auditorium for the movie's special 20th Anniversary screening. (Note the prior DVD had an isolated audio track of this performance that ran during the film, which is not included here).<br /><br />-Designs, Photographs and Marketing: A series of previously released still galleries<br /><br />-Trailer (SD): The full 2-minute theatrical trailer (offering some unused footage of E.T.'s ship landing) in non-anamorphic standard def.<br /><br />-Special Olympics/McDonalds TV spot</p></body></html>

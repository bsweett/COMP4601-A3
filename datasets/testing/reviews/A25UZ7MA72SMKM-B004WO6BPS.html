<meta name="summary" content="Expertly brought to the screen, but very dark."></head><body><p>When I say this film is dark, I don't mean in its visual presentation, which is superb. The cinematography and special effects are top notch. But much like "Half Blood Prince", DH Part 1 has very little of the delight and joy which were evident in the early books and movies. Yes, those stories had the dark elements associated with Voldemort and in the dangerous seeming climaxes, but other parts of the stories were highly entertaining and uplifting in their depiction of life at Hogwarts. Harry's problems with his aunt, uncle, and cousin were played for laughs. Classroom scenes were at time frustrating, and at times funny, but always interesting.<br /><br />At some point in this process JK Rowling lost the wonder of her early books, and began to see herself as a SERIOUS WRITER OF DRAMA. At that point all the fun drained out of her stories. I have finished them merely to finish them, not because I really had fun with the last books, or these last three movies. DH Part 1 is a lot like "The Dark Knight" in that the movie is expertly crafted, but just gives the viewer very little hang onto in terms of tension breaks. I think this is a big mistake for any movie. The goal of a movie such as this should be to entertain the audience, not exhaust them. I'll have no problem re-watching the first five movies at times, but I seriously doubt there will be ANY repeat viewings of the final three movies for me. Just as even though I'm a big time Batman fan, I've had absolutely no desire to watch "The Dark Knight" a second time. Unrelenting tension and misery for the main characters isn't my thing. I get enough of that just running a business. LOL<br /><br />So if you have read all the books and watched the first six films, certainly there is no way you are going to miss this one, or the conclusion. You have too much invested in the story over the years, just as we do. You will be impressed at the special effects, which are so natural to this vision of a magical society by now that you will forget that they ARE special effects. You'll be uplifted at our heroes' little victories, and sad at the tragedies which befall them. If you're like me, in the end you may also feel a bit empty, because the charm and joy which the first books and movies in this series promised is long gone by the stark and depressing tone of its ending.</p></body></html>

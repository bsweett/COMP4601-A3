If you missed this film during it's theatrical run, it's a great drama to pick up on DVD during the holiday seasons.<br /><br />Russell Crowe stars in the film as Jim Braddock. Jim Braddock and his family are living during hard times in the early 1930's during The Great Depression. Jim is a boxer who is dealt a blow when he breaks his hand. After he breaks his hand, most everyone in his inner circle loses faith in his boxing career. Renee Zelwegger stars in the film as his wife who is doing the best she can to keep the family together. At one point, she finds herself facing an eviction from their apartment as her daughter looks on. When one of their three children gets ill, Renee's character does what any concerned mother would do. She takes her children to a better environment with other family members. Jack-furious with her decision applies for public assistance and continues his boxing dreams. Cinderella Man is one of those real period piece type of films. In the film Jack will eventually fight Max Baer. For those of you who might not know this, Max Baer is the real life father of Beverly Hillbillies star Max Baer Jr. They did an excellent job of re-creating life in the 1930's. Jack's story of struggle and triumph is inspiring also.<br /><br />The film is well over two hours long, so when you pop in the DVD, make sure you have plenty of snacks ready because it's a long one, but it's a good story. This DVD will make an excellent gift for a family member or friend who lived during that time period, or someone who enjoys boxing.</p></body></html>

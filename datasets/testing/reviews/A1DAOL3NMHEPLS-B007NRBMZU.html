<meta name="summary" content="It's a Not-so-Wonderful Life"></head><body><p>The idea that the world around you would change -- perhaps dramatically -- if you changed something in your past goes back at least to the 1946 classic, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot; In &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot; this theme gets beaten to death (as is one of the characters in the movie, at least on one timeline).<br /><br /> Many reviewers have erroneously called this a &quot;time travel&quot; movie; it's really more of an examination of what might happen in one young man's life if he had the ability to project his adult persona back into the past and alter events in his childhood. And boy, does he have reason to do so! There's a lot of grim stufff back there!<br /><br /> Overall, the movie works fairly well, although it's pretty heavy-handed and Ashton Kutcher is no great shakes of an actor. He handles the lead role passably well, but it's no Oscar-level performance. And there are some places where Evan does things that are obviously stupid even at the time he does them; it's almost as if Kutcher's &quot;Kelso&quot; character from &quot;That '70s Show&quot; has taken over. Still, if you like movies of this genre, you'll probably be willing to overlook them. And Amy Smart shines as the ever-changing Kayley.<br /><br /> If you're expecting greatness, look elsewhere. But if you just want passable entertainment with a smidge of thought-provoking ideas mixed in -- and you don't mind depictions of violence directed against children and animals -- &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot; fills the bill.<br /><br /> PS: Of the two versions on this DVD, I personally preferred the version released in theatres.</p></body></html>

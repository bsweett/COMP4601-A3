Its three hours flow like the Mississippi and I can't think of too many films that can be watched over and over again while still managing to entertain and excite. The Godfather made the reputations of De Niro, Caan, and Pacino, but it made Brando a god among men. Unbelievable! After my tenth time renting it, I finally bought it off Amazon. I encourage you to do the same.</p></body></html>

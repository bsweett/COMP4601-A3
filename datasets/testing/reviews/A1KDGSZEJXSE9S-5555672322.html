This time, all the victims aren't teens, or even all young people... Anyway, the main character is Chris. A girl that was once before attacked by Jason and has returned to see how "strong" she is.<br /><br />Little does she know that the man that attacked her before is still around and looking for more victims.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This is one of the better ones in the franchise... Yeah, we have people going on about originally... But it's pointless to complain as I think because everybody knows what these movies are before you even watch them. It's beating a deadhorse really...<br /><br />Besides, this movie attempted to add abit of a story with the Chris/Jason thing... It just didn't explore it well enough. But the gore, and the feel of the movie make up for it.<br /><br />We get some of the more gory kills and mood is good here. The film was in 3D at theaters and naturally you will not get the best of it on TV... But I enjoyed this entry due to the killings and the pace is better here. It doesn't hurt that Chris is possibly the best "hero" of the series.<br /><br />It could have got 4 had it explored the Jason/Chris connection that happend before.</p></body></html>

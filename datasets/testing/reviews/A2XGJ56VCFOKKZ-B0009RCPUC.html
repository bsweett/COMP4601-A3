<meta name="summary" content="Haunting portrayal that leaves a lasting mark"></head><body><p>I never understood why this film caused so much controversy in Germany. It was about about time that the Germans examine their own history and the most notorious leader of the 20th Century. Because the controversy surrounded the portrayal of Hitler as a real human being who could pet a dog one minute, while ordering other people's death the next; or who was kind to his secretary even while he yelled tirades against his staff of military men for their incompetence...I actually expected to see more of Hitler's "nice side." The controversy was nothing but overbloated talk, as this film clearly portrays Hitler as the monster he is. If people don't understand that humans are often contradictory and capable of showing kindness to some people while ordering massive death for complete strangers...then they really don't understand human nature. Just because one shows Hitler as a complex, contradictory human being doesn't soften his reputation. So he was kind to dogs. So he was a gentle boss to his secretary. So what? This film doesn't excuse the fact that he was still a monster of a human being.<br /><br />The actor who portays him is so uncanny in his physical likeness that I did wonder how people might act towards him after this role. The film is so compelling and disturbing to watch...for the same reason as I remain clueless as to how anyone could follow and be loyal to this man's evil vision to the very end. Perhaps the most disturbing part of all is the beautiful, elegant, upper middle class lady Magda Goebbels who decides to poison her six blue-eyed, blond-haired Aryan children because she didn't want them to grow up in a world without National Socialism. She does the deed with such cool, creepy finesse that it downright shocks the viewer just how much the Nazi movement resembles a doomsday cult, complete down to the charismatic leader.<br /><br />After watching this film, as great as it is, I didn't think I'd want to see it again. However, a few days later, I was still thinking about this film and will probably buy it on DVD at some point. It is something that should be seen by all and seen a few times. For one reason, reading subtitles throughout the film only makes me miss some of the facial expressions of the various people. I do like that we get the authenticity of a German-language movie about the last ten days of the Third Reich, but an English language track would have been nice so I could watch it in English once while I concentrate on the images and expressions that I miss when trying to read subtitles. Anyone interested in WWII history, history in general, or totalitarian systems/cults should definitely see this film. After I watched it, I wanted to watch "Schindler's List" and "Band of Brothers" again, as well as picking up my long postponed plan to read "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich." This film belongs in that canon of extraordinary work, capturing the chaos of a collapsing government, a ruined nation, and a group of leaders who preferred to commit suicide than face punishment for the evil they unleashed on the world. They knew the Soviets would be harsher in retributive punishment than the Americans. An excellent lesson in history grounded in realism.</p></body></html>

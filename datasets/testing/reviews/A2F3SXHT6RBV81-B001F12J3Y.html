<meta name="summary" content="Adventures Galore in a Magical Train."></head><body><p>Adapted from a classic children's book written by Chris Van Allsburg to the screen using computerized technology about a train ride to the North Pole, an expensive process but well worth the visual effects.  This was a complete Tom Hanks film using software to match his voice and mannerisms to many varied roles.  I liked him best as the conductor who punched letters into the children's tickets, return punches would complete a word -- each different to match their personalities and needs.<br /><br />There is a lovely snow scene in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at 11 p.m. on Christmas Eve when the mysterious steam engine arrived in the boy's own front yard with effects (shaking and noise) similar to an earthquake.  A skeptic about the validity of Santa Claus, he'd already looked in the World Book encyclopedia to read about the North Pole never thinking he'd travel there in less than an hour.  The boy was a lot like Brett (age 9) as he watched the mechanical Santa in a store window as the train went past.<br /><br />It is a magic train, all alight in several cars but the children, dressed in sleepware, sat in one car except for Billy.  A sad little boy who'd never received Christmas gifts, he sat by himself in the caboose.<br /><br />There were tapdancing waiters who served refreshments.  The hot chocolate left a brown mustache (like the while 'milk' one) on each child.  A lost ticket, swirling in the wind, lands amid a wolf pack; with the help of a bald eagle, it magically found its way back inside the train.<br /><br />That's only the beginning.  Boy discovers the hobo who calls himself the 'king of the train' on top of a coach car and they ski (cross-country style) to the engine where he jumps into the coal car.  He thought he was asleep and dreaming in the swirling snow.<br /><br />The hobo imprints on his mind that 'seeing is believing.'  But after a harrowing escape from the breaking ice after the train jackknives and slithers to safety, he learns that 'sometimes the most real things in the world are those we cannot see.'<br /><br />Inside the cab of the locomotive, he blows the whistle, and the train has to stop as deer are all over the tracks.  It seems that the engineer could talk Karibo when his long red hair is pulled.  Both engineers were comical characters as played by Michael Jeter.<br /><br />The music was magnificent as they take a wild ride down the mountain like a roller coaster.  We witness optical illusions with the Northern Lights at the Arctic Circle.  The tramp turns out to be a puppeteer with a marionette of Scrooge (bah, humbug), both patterned after Tom Hanks.<br /><br />At the North Pole, we see a lighted Christmas tree even taller than our National tree in Washington, D.C. or that at Rockefeller Center in New York City.  Three children are separated from the group and endure another wild ride on the curvy tracks around this city of lights in the runaway caboose.<br /><br />There appears to Boy a ghost of the hobo offering a nice hot 'cup of Joe' before they are stranded on a train turntable.  After a perilous walk to the tunnel, they find Santa's workshop in a cul-de-sac (dead end).<br /><br />The lost children had adventures galore in the inner workings of the labyrinth and see all the 'good of Christmas.'  If you see only one Christmas movie this year, let this be it.  A delight for the whole family, it can't be beat for having Christmas spirit -- plus appropriate music.<br /><br />Bing Crosby's version of 'White Christmas' is playing as the mountain of gifts is lifted from an open observatory like Kitt Peak in Arizona and floated over the lighted city in a hot air balloon.  The 'flying eleves' ("kids, do not try this at home," directed the conductor) sky-dived as the enormous bundle is loaded onto Santa's sleigh.  It takes some bungie-jumping to put the star on the tall tree.<br /><br />As long trumpets herald the arrival of St. Nick, the prancing reindeer are a sight to behold.  It's as if we were in the Land of Oz with all the munchkins.  Santa's blue eyes were like those I remarked on recently when I talked with a 'Victorian Santa' at the East Tennessee History Center.<br /><br />Santa explains his gifts: first, you must 'believe'; one child received a 'smidgin of humility'; another, "no greater gift than friendship."  He tells everyone that "the true spirit of Christmas is in your heart."  His fiber-optic reindeer whip made the tall tree magical.<br /><br />The Polar Express returns and they leave the city of lights as they head for home amid thick snow flakes and sparkling icycles.  The children are told that "it doesn't matter where a train is going; what matters is to decide to get on."  Under the tree on Christmas morning is an old fashioned truck toy (which dates the story) and a harlequin doll like the one I have for Eric, age 4.  Santa had gift-wrapped and delivered his special present, The Christmas Bell.<br /><br />Our local excursion train, the Rambler, is taking a Polar Express this Christmas on its regular route with readings of this book as special entertainment.  A giant step (I've been on these trips at different times of the Spring, Summer and Fall.), but this time it's 'reservation only.'<br /><br />Completed in only 56 days as a result of the computer technology (rapid progress), I predict this will become a classic like Burl Ives' 'Frosty the Snowman' and 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'  An uplifting story.</p></body></html>

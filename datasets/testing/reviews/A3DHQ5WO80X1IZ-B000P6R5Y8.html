<meta name="summary" content="Better than a lot of kids movies, even if not perfect"></head><body><p>I have never heard of this childrens book, but I watched this on a whim. Pretty good, and there are some surprising twists that I wouldn't expect. One review described it as "Chronicles of Narnia" meets an After School Special. Pretty accurate, IMO. Hits a little too hard upon the Bible a couple times for my taste (at least 'Narnia' was more subtle about it), but otherwise an entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

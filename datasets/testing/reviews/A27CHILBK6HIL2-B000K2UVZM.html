People sit up and take notice when De Palma takes the director's chair. De Palma directed The Untouchables, one of my favorite movies of all time. However, The Black Dahlia is probably his biggest dud ever, even more so than Mission To Mars. Rarely do you see a film with so much potential go absolutely nowhere. The trailer would lead you to believe that the movie was about the murder of actress Elizabeth Short and the entire process of uncovering the mystery. The movie is more about the characters and the murder sort of serves as a backdrop to the central plot. That's where the problem of the film lies. There is no focus in the plot as to what the movie is actually about, and it doesn't help that it moves at an incredibly slow pace. The film is centered around three main characters: Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett), Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). Two buddy detectives fall upon the case of Elizabeth Short during a routine bust, and we slowly move away from the case and just see how it affects their relationship with their female friend. What follows is a mess of film noir that uses the case merely as a backdrop. There was also one aspect of the film that just sort of took me out of the whole experience, and that was the use of the POV (point of view) shot. It was used sparingly for Hartnett's character with absolutely no dramatic effect. The reason why you don't see POV shots that much out of horror films is that a camera does not mimick human vision. If we saw the way a camera saw then our eyeballs would not be able to move, so when POV is used in film it has to be used for a real purpose. Here, De Palma uses it with no purpose to it and it was just frustrating. The only thing it did do was take me out of the movie. There was a distance between me as an audience member from the story being told on screen, and when you lose that emotional connection then the film becomes boring. Let me state right now what the trailer tried to trick you with. The movie is based on a book by James Ellroy who is the author of the novel L.A Confidential, not the screenwriter of either films. The screenwriter of L.A Confidential and this film are two different people. Josh Friedman wrote the screenplay for The Black Dahlia, and his previous work only consists of Chain Reaction and War Of The Worlds (2005). So, you can see we have a novice screenwriter on our hands, and that is where I point my finger to blame.<br /><br />ACTING: While there are no Academy Award winning actors in the film, we do have a pretty great selection of talent. Josh Hartnett fits the role and does a mighty fine job of playing it. Aaron Eckhart was pretty good too, his character was what really made the film a film noir. Scarlett Johansson is one of my favorite actresses, and she does a great job here. She plays the counterpart to Hilary Swank's character (look for the black/white contrast in the characters' appearance), but Hilary Swank may I say was quite awful in this. I just didn't like her acting in the movie, which is strange because I loved her in Million Dollar Baby and Insomnia. She doesn't add any depth to her character and she merely serves as a plot device who will end up helping you easily figure out who the murdere is. Anyway, the acting can't hide the fact that the script is in disarray.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Brian De Palma doesn't give the film any style, Mark Isham's weak score didn't help either. There was a real lack of atmosphere despite great sets and costumes, and I blame the score for that. The lack of focus lies in the script's flaws, and don't look for the acting to save it. The movie swung hard and missed the target completely. Universal spent $60 million on the production, and with the recent release of Hollywoodland I figure that someone stole from someone. If you want less cheesy film noir and a great movie experience then go see Hollywoodland.</p></body></html>

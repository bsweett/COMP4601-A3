The plot, the dialogue, the acting, the mystery are too artificial and contrived. Not a single scene, from the start in the bathtub to the kiss in the doorway, is in any way believable: the same might be said of the others I've mentioned, but they succeed in drawing the viewer into their stories, and make him care about the outcome. This does not happen here: it is impossible to identify emotionally with anything that happens, and the murder puzzle is routine, in the style of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers and countless other detective mystery authors in the 30s and 40s. Nevertheless, Laura does have a certain fascination. Although none of the actors convince as living in their parts, they still seem interesting as highly contrasted personalities, with widely differentiated careers and backgrounds. What struck me throughout was that I was being presented with a life-style and a set of values which seem totally to have vanished. A recognizably real world of constant cigarettes and cocktails, over-furnished apartments, social free-loaders and polished snubs --- perhaps this still exists somewhere, it's just that I left it behind 5 decades ago. 1944 was well before the days of method, minimalism, psychedelia, kitchen-sink and trailer-trash. Class ruled, and manners held a meaning they no longer do. This brittle house of cards was bound for collapse.<br /><br />The best thing about this disc is the section featuring the sympathetic biographies of Gene Tierney and Vincent Price. Both seemed to be, in very different yet oddly similar ways, rather fine and good people. One fortunate, the other unfortunate. These insights make the whole package well worth seeing, but the film on its own is, regretfully, not worth more than three stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An okay movie..."></head><body><p>This movie is okay.  The speical effects were awesome the actors were good but it just felt like I was missing something when watching it.  I did like it just not well enough to own it which I did buy it because I had never seen it before and thought it looked good.  I would recommend going out and renting it first because like me you may not feel this is a movie to own just more of a one time thing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'John Coffey - Like the drink, only not spelt the same'"></head><body><p>A truly great film, starring the terrific Tom Hanks. This movie shows he can play any one in any film, and he does it well. <p>Many Stephen King movies aren't worth their weight in gold, particularly some of the "Stephen King's" whatever. This one, along with Carrie, is. It's worthwhile watching (even if you do need to keep your legs crossed throughout!) and it'll definitely make you re-think certain things.<p>There any many good actors in this. Alongside Tom Hanks, there's David Morse (Brutus "Brutal" Howell), Bonnie Hunt (Jan Edgecomb), Michael Clarke Duncan (John Coffey), the late Michael Jeter (Eduard Delacroix) and Dabbs Greer - 'old' Paul Edgecomb, better known to a select few as Reverend Alden from Little House On The Prairie!<p>There is a lot of clever camera trickery used in this movie, to make Michael Clarke Duncan look even bigger! He's a big hunk of love to begin with, and considering there's only an inch between him and David Morse to begin with, it was done very well, as Michael seems to tower over everyone. Also, quite a lot of the time, you only saw Michael's top half - I'm sure he must have been standing on something. It's the first shot(s) of him, when he first comes onto the Green Mile, and everyone looks upwards!<p>Of course, unless you're thick as two short planks (like moi) you will have realised that Michael's character, John Coffey, has the same initials as another infamous healing character. So it's almost a modernised version of that, although maybe better and less graphic.<p>It's obvious what will happen, but what I noticed throughout the movie, other characters get "seen" sitting on the electric chair, and getting electrocuted, but you don't see this with John Coffey. The camera goes somewhere else and you only get a quick shot of him sitting on it - it's almost like he got a dignified exit. I suggest if you have a very weak stomach, you turn away when Eduard Delacroix gets electrocuted. It is not pleasant, and you WILL feel sick.<p>There is a lot of 'green mile' imagery in this movie - of course, during the main part of the film, but at the start, the floor of the nursing home is a green-ish colour.<p>And if you're Mr(s) Know-It-All about your movies, you will perhaps notice that the music played over the loudspeakers in the retirement home as Old Paul Edgecomb first walks out of his room is the same as the music the nurses played at medication time in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest!<p>This film comes highly recommended, and the book is just as good. The extras are quite good at the same time, although not if you don't like looking at Stephen King!</p></body></html>

Yes, it appears that Saw III is the end of the series as we know it (doubtful though) as Jigsaw's increasingly debilitating health leads him and Amanda (Shawnee Smith) to orchestrating one last, terrifying game.  This time around, a doctor (Bahar Soomekh) and her vengeful husband (Angus MacFadyen) are now pawns in what could be Jigsaw's last game; and needless to say, things don't turn out well for anyone at all.  Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed the lacking second film in the series, returns to helm this chapter, and does considerably better this time around.  The traps and death scenes aren't as intricately put together as what we've seen before, but they're all the more grisly.  The gore level gets upped as well, as people are tortured and dispatched in ways that if they don't make you squirm, consider seeking help.  James Wan and Leigh Whannel, who crafted the first film in the series, are reportedly done with the franchise, but rumor has it that Lion's Gate won't let the Saw series ride off into the sunset just yet.  All in all, Saw III is a better than expected entry into what is becoming a predictable series, but let's hope that the Lion's Gate execs know when to call it quits.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny and the cast is great"></head><body><p>Starsky and Hutch is based on the 70's tv series. It stars Ben Stiller as Starsky who takes his job as a cop way too seriously. While Owen Wilson plays Hutch who doesn't take his job seriously as well. Stiller and Wilson are perfect for the parts. Stiller trys harder to be in character with his curly black wig. While Wilson just shows up for every movie he does just as....Owen Wilson. He doesn't need to change his look or attitude, he's just funny as himself.<br /><br />  The supporting cast is great too. You have Vince Vaughn who's making a name for himself in comedies. He plays the coke dealing villain who made an untraceable coke. All he did pretty much is mix coke with sweet and low lol. Juliet Lewis (Natural Born Killers), plays his g/f and Jason Bateman (Teen Wolf Too) plays his main henchman. Will Farrell is funny as always in a small role as a prison inmate that Starsky and Hutch go to for info on the coke dealers. He has an obsession of dragons and has Starsky and Hutch do all these weird poses before he'll tell them what they want to know. Last but not least Snoop Dogg plays the role he's meant to play, a pimp like character who knows his grass lol. With a cast this funny it's hard not to like Starsky and Hutch.</p></body></html>

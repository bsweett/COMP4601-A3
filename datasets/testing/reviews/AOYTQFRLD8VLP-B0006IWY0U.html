Confidential", Russell Crowe was the cop with  the dark and tragic past who found love in an unlikely place. In his Oscar-winning turn in "Gladiator" he showed us that man cannot live by bread and circuses alone. In "A Beautiful Mind", he takes the audience on a bizarre journey between genius and madness, and now, in this seafaring epic to which Peter Weir gives a surprisingly lighthanded direction, based on the novels<br />by Patrick O'Brian, Crowe lends his formidable stance to the role of Captain Jack Aubrey as he leads the crew of HMS Surprise in a campaign against the French ship Acheron in 1805.<br /> As the story commences, we view the British ship on the glistening waters off the coast of Brazil. The pre-dawn calm is shattered by the sound of the Acheron's cannonfire.<br /> Soon, the audience bears witness to the poignancy of lost innocence, graphic surgeries at sea, and the general claustrophobic conditions of a battleship in the early 19th century. A viewer can almost smell the stench, taste the awful food, and feel directly in the presence of both the lesser and greater of two weevils.<br /> The monotony is broken up with singing by the crew members, upperclassmen as well as underlings, and occassionally the elegant sound of Aubrey's violin as it mingles with the cello played by the ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin (a role in which Crowe is reunited with  his 'Beautiful Mind' co-star, Paul Bettany)on a duet or two. As Aubrey's friend, the more analytical<br />Maturin provides a stablizing influence on the Captain.<br /> The camaraderie among the men deepens during Aubrey's dinnertime anecdotes, and outrageously bad puns as he loosens up a little while slightly inebriated.<br /> But the astute captain is firm and consistant in running his ship.  The film drives home the point that the young boys who served (personified by the angelic Max Pirkis as Lord Blakeney) were not coddled because of their tender ages, and were made to grow up quickly in an era that had less respect for childhood.<br /> Viewers follow the crew through tragedies caused by natural or man-made disasters, and they also receive psychological<br />profiles of men who are forced to serve in such confining conditions.<br /> Aubrey often faces some wrenching dilemmas, but after many years at sea, never wavers in his certainty of whatever course of action he chooses. He spends a good bit of onscreen time  bestriding the deck with eyes that narrow and a perfect Cupid's bow mouth twisting into a scowl of determination during battle. A lot of the drama that cannot be expressed in words is expressed in close-ups  of Crowe's gracefully oval-shaped visage. When speaking in a jesting or slightly jesting manner, his large, deep-set  eyes-- which can never decide between emerald and opalescence--widen, and grow round as if he were daft.But he is mostly staid and stoic although we do see his delight in his work as he climbs up to and down from the highest heights of his ship to be rewarded with a more panoramic view of the ocean with upperclassman James D'Arcy at his side.<br /> Occassionally the men serving under him share his delight, and are relieved from months of confinement at sea when they weigh anchor in the Galapagos Islands where Dr. Maturin does his naturalist research and the crew play cricket as a respite from their duties. There is a sense of gentleness and serenity  brought on by the  beautiful Oscar winning-cinematography of the curious seals, tortoises, and other creatures as they receive a rare visit from humans. In a few brief moments the maimed Lord Blakeley has a chance to be a child as he roams about joyously in loose clothing as an assistant to the recently injured Maturin.<br /> Soon enough the pursuit of the Acheron is resumed. But the trip to the Galapagos results in Aubrey's gaining insight on how to lure and overtake the enemy ship. Strangely, the film's battle scenes didn't strike me as too intense, and while this film has its inevitably  dark and brooding moments, the lighter moments compliment and compensate for them quite nicely. There is a very stirring moment when Aubrey finally  views the corpse of his mortal enemy. Perhaps he feels some satisfaction...But how young and handsome his rival looks even in death. One wonders what his story was and how hard Aubrey had to try to suppress any feeling of common humanity as he accepted the French Captain's sword in surrender.<br /> Suppression of any such feelings may not have been too difficult when we see the high price of victory, laid out in sewn-up hammocks on the deck of the British ship...Men and boys of all ages in whom we've invested a few hour's time...The loss of sage advice of the elderly seamen, and the permanently halted ambition of the young men are dramatically emphasized as we view them lined up, pale and still, awaiting their final journey...<br /> But soon life aboard HMS Surprise resumes its normalcy, and when a piece of misinformation is revealed to Aubrey the merry pursuit of duty continues and as the crew go to quarters, we are left with a stringed duet to remember them by.</p></body></html>

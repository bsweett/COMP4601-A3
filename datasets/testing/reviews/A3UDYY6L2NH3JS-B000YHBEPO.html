<meta name="summary" content="Difficult to swim in that shallowness"></head><body><p>This is a strange film in many ways. The music is always the same. The packed action is always the same. The spectacular events are always the same. The same is in the series I remember from 1969-1970. And yet everything is different. We have the right to doubt we are on any right or wrong side. Everyone is against everyone else and everyone is a double agent somewhere. When all agents are double agents, then we have turned the circle of the plot into a square dance and that does not really help us know what is who and who is what. Some beautiful scenes in Shanghai, less in the Vatican, but apart from that we don't have much time to sightsee around. This film is nothing but action and the depth of its meaning is so shallow that we are happy to be able to compensate for it with the height of the buildings. The TV tower in Shanghai is really impressive. But I defy you to find out what that rabbit's foot is.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></body></html>

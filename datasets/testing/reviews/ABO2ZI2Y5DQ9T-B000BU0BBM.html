<meta name="summary" content="Disenchanted: Gilliam's Least Magical Film"></head><body><p>Personally I welcome anything from visual maestro Terry Gilliam or ex-Monty Python members, but 'The Brothers Grimm' falls short of enchanting magic of 'The Fisher King' or deliciously dark humor of 'Time Bandits.'  'The Brothers Grimm' is fun to see, especially the detailed visual techniques of the director, but the story is stale and dull, not knowing what it wants to do.  Sorry if I offend his fans, but this Grimm world is far from the originality his name is always associated with.<br /><br />[GOOD STARTING...] You know where the problem lies.  It is the story of Ehren Kruger, whose previous work was very ordinary horror 'Ring 2.'  Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are The Brothers Grimm, who, in this film, are not respected scholars of falklore, but are jolly con-men who make good use of gimmicks to convince the unsuspecting German people of the presence of the horrifying witches.  Of course, it is the brothers who banish the monsters from the village before receiving the money.<br /><br />So far the story is not bad.  Silly, but OK, I kind of like that.  Then, we are told that girls are missing in the cursed forest surrounding one decaying tower, where a witch (a real one, played by Monica Bellucci) is said to live.  There, many girls start to vanish, including Little Red Riding Hood.<br /><br />[AND THE STORY GETS ASTRAY] Nice touch, I admit.  However, the film gets slower, becoming more and more dull as it reaches the part where the French troop led by the commander Jonathan Pryce (remember him in Gilliam's masterpiece 'Brazil'?).  They arrest the Brothers after occupying the land, and hand them to an overconfidnet "Italian" officer Peter Stormare, who does overact so much that I really wished his early and quick demise.  Sadly Terry Gillaim thought otherwise.<br /><br />The rest of the stort is about the mystery of the forest, which is not particularly fascinating.  Kruger's script fails to interest us because of the too familiar elements, and as the story nears the conclusion, the logics of the film starts to fall apart.  The climax is terribly incoherent, and the disenchanting love triangle involving one femele hunter (Lena Hedley) only drags me down.<br /><br />Thankfully Terry Gilliam's vibrant imagination and his wicked humor are still there, barely saving the film itself from a total mess.  Well, actually, it IS a mess, especially in the second half, and not-so-good CGIs (of the wolf, specially) and very detached acting from Bellucci do not help, but still a beautiful mess to see.  But I'd rather watch his great films in the past again, except 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.'</p></body></html>

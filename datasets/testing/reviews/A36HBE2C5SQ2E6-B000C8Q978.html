<meta name="summary" content="a solid, brooding film that leaves alot of questions unanswered"></head><body><p>After being dumped by yet another girlfriend, Don Johnston(Bill Murray)receives a mysterious envelope with news that he has a son and that his son is looking for him. He, along with a friend, plans a trip that will devolve into his past and will examine his relationships with his old flames long after they have ended.<br /><br />Jim Jarmusch is notoriously known to have films that are slowly done. People say that his films move at the pace of a snail. Well, in this movie, his style really finds a niche here. The film is slow and really detailed when it comes to the shots and the pacing. I have had no problem with that. His films, Down By The Law and Dead Man, were impressive. Jarsmuch's writing skills are solid too, although there is not all that much dialogue in the film.<br /><br />Bill Murray's performance was sluggish, brooding, and depressing yet brilliant in a way. He takes a role that is extremely complex and lonely and makes it his own. He literally amazes us and makes us locked to the screen with his performance. He was fantastic.<br /><br />I have been a big fan of Jim Jarmusch after I watched Dead Man late one night in my room, with no light on. I felt for the characters in every films that he has made. His slow style won't suit anyone. In fact, some people probably won't have the patience to watch a Jarmusch film. In my opinion, Jarmusch probably originated the long shots, no dialogue and Gus Van Stant just borrowed off of him. Jarmusch shows that he is a great filmmaker and this film is proof why we need more films from this man.</p></body></html>

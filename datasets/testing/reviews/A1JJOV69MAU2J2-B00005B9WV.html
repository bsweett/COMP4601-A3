<meta name="summary" content="Modern classic, don't miss!"></head><body><p>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon looks great on DVD, with great sound and lots of interesting extras, including  fascinating interviews with Director Ang Lee and Michelle Yeoh (who looks and sounds far different in real life).<p>The movie itself transcends the romance and martial arts genres with a mystical, magical fusion that is breathtaking.<p>From the moment the actors fly over the first rooftops to the last final leap, the movie is mesmerizing, taking us into a fully realized vision of old China, and its martial arts gang underworld.<p>The acting is first-rate, the cinematography revolutionary and the fight scenes weave tales of their own...<p>This is Ang Lee's second masterpiece. Check out Sense and Sensibility for the other.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best in sci-fi/horror."></head><body><p>In the distant future, a group of passengers-which include a murderous convict and a brave though morally conflicted pilot-aboard a transport ship crashland onto a seemingly uninhabited desert planet. Exploring the region, they discover there are ferocious creatures living under the ground, afraid of the light. The survivors believe they are safe, only to become aware of an approaching solar eclipse! Fast-paced thriller has lots of action, scares, and suspense, boasts very impressive special effects and production values, and features two terrific leads in the sexy Radha Mitchell and Vin Diesel. Superb direction from David Twohy solidifies this exemplary sci-fi/horror tale.<br />**** 1/2 out of *****</p></body></html>

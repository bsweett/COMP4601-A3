<meta name="summary" content="One of the funniest movies ever"></head><body><p>This movie is just hilarious.  I don't know how else to put it.  It's basically a series of short sketches that have to do with the legend of King Arthur.  He blunders his way about the land gathering 'knights' on his way and leading them on a search for the Holy Grail.  Along the way, he has some hilarious encounters.<p>One of the funniest aspects of this movie is the dialogue.  Some of the scenes are incredibly funny.  The burning of the witch (she turned me into a newt!) and Dennis the peasant (you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just cause some watery taut threw a sword at you!) are among the most memorable.  Equally funny is Arthur's battle with the black knight and Sir Robyn's encounter with the giant (when danger reared it's ugly head, he boldly turned his tail and fled).<p>The special features in this set are fabulous.  What could be more funny than Monty Python in legos!  Just the bonus disc is enough to entertain someone for hours.<p>Monty Python is undoubtedly one of the most talented comedy troupes ever to perform, and this is the creme of the python's crop.  If Monty Python isn't funny, I don't know what is.</p></body></html>

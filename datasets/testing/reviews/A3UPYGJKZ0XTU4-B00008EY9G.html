<meta name="summary" content="Thoroughly Enjoyable Suspense Film. Worthy of the Genre."></head><body><p>When flash flooding caused by heavy rains makes nearby roads impassible, 10 people are stranded at a roadside motel somewhere in the American West: a middle-aged couple with a young child (John C. McGinley &amp; Leila Kenzle), a prostitute named Paris on her way to a better life in Florida (Amanda Peet), an aging irascible actress (Rebecca DeMornay) and her driver, Edward (John Cusack), a police officer (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner, a recently married young couple (Clea DuVall &amp; William Scott Lee), and the motel's manager, Larry (John Hawkes). One by one, the stranded motorists are murdered. Edward and the police officer take it upon themselves to keep the motel's occupants safe and to find the killer, whom they immediately suspect to be the police officer's escaped prisoner. But even confining the guests to one room where they can observe one another doesn't slow the killer's progress, and panic ensues.<p>&quot;Identity&quot; is a thoroughly enjoyable suspense film that is truly worthy of the &quot;suspense&quot; genre. It's a slasher movie of sorts, with one gruesome murder after another. But the mystery of the killer's identity is emphasized over the gore. And the killer's identity truly is a mystery. Michael Cooney's clever screenplay and director James Mangold's adept direction give the audience more information than the characters have, so we believe that we may know who the killer is. This increases the audience's investment in the story and helps create suspense. But it turns out that we have incomplete information, as well, which leaves the audience to be surprised but satisfied when the killer's identity is revealed. The film's only real flaw is that we never understand exactly what happened at the motel. I found the difficulty in separating fact from fantasy when all is said and done to be frustrating. This didn't actually detract from my enjoyment of the film until the very end, though. Everyone loves a murder mystery, so I think that &quot;Identity&quot; will appeal to a wide audience -although not a squeamish audience.</p></body></html>

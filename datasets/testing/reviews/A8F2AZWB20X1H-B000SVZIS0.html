Burton is a very talented director; I loved "Sleepy Hollow", but someone should make him write 100 times on a blackboard "IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT."  The original "Planet of the Apes" is one of the best sci-fi films ever made; it didn't need re-telling, so what was the point in remaking it?  The story line doesn't work, the apes look like humans dressing up in simian costumes on Halloween, and the dialogue is from hunger.  There's a lot of grunting and groaning that I guess is supposed to convince us that this is how apes communicate, but it's only marginally worse than the spoken lines in the film.  The mind-blowing scene in the original, Charlton Heston staring open-mouthed and bug-eyed at the ruins of the Statue of Liberty and realizing he was home all along, couldn't be duplicated in the remake, so this time around we get Mark Wahlberg zooming home from Apeland in a rocket ship and crash-landing on the front steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, only to discover that the Memorial has undergone a facelift and Lincoln now looks like the Most High Ape who successfully revolted against human domination and established the reign of the simians.  It just doesn't work; but then, neither does the picture.  See the original.</p></body></html>

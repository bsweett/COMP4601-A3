Wow, this is the 335th review of this movie so I guess no one will ever see it but me.<p>I didn't like charlie angels, the TV show that much, but my wife went out and rented this movie on the recommend of my oldest son.  As harry Carey would say, holy cow!  I liked it.  The whole family likes it.  This is one of the movie we now bring when we go for a trip in the motor home.<p>OK.  It is not a 5 star movie, but it is fun.  There are funny bits, there are cool scenes and cool fights.  There is wierd thin man.  There is drew Barrymore.  There is Bill murray as Bosley and fun music.<p>We also like Tremors and Princess Bride becuase we like movie that make us smile.  This movie has a lot of smiles and a lot of fun and OK for the family to enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A film so great you are forced to like it"></head><body><p>The epic saga of a Mafia family, focusing on the youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), an honest war hero who is progressively drawn into the family business.<br /><br />The mark of a great movie is that, even if you have no interest in the subject matter, the film is so well made that you are forced to like it, or at the very least appreciate it. "The Godfather" is one of those movies. In general, I do not like Mafia movies, and as a result, I felt certain that I would hate this movie, and yet, within the first 15 minutes of starting this film, I found myself drawn into the saga of the Corleone family.<br /><br />It is virtually impossible to find fault with "The Godfather". Everything about it is perfect, from the script, to the acting, to the directing. Some negative reviewers have called this film boring, and I will admit that this film is slow moving, but slow moving does not translate into boredom. The pacing of this film is perfect for what it is and it allows the viewer to become fully acquainted with each and every member of the Corleone clan. The only factor that I would say could possibly prevent someone from watching and enjoying this film is the violence. Back in 1972, "The Godfather" was considered to be extremely violent, and even by 21st century standards, the violence is still intense and likely to distress some viewers.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can think of about "The Godfather" is the unfortunate timing of its release. "The Godfather" was released in the same year as "Cabaret", another great film, resulting in the Academy Awards for that year being split between the two films ("The Godfather" got Best Picture and Best Actor, while "Cabaret" got Best Director, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor). Both of these films are so good that they deserve all of the above mentioned Oscars (well, with the possible exception of Best Actress, since there was no lead actress in "The Godfather"), and I just wish that they could have been released in separate years so that they could have achieved just that.</p></body></html>

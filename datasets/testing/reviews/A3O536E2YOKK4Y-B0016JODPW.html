<meta name="summary" content="A "Victimless Crime" Gone Wrong"></head><body><p>Sidney Lumet's 2007 film "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a drama/crime thriller about two brothers who decide to solve their money problems by robbing a jewelry store, and not just any jewelry store. It's a "victimless crime" argues the older brother and mastermind (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The younger brother (Ethan Hawke) is hoodwinked into the harebrained scheme, but makes the mistake of adding a third person to the mix. From there it's a steady downward spiral.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei plays Seymour's wife and, although her character is shallow, materialistic and immoral, Marisa never looked better (at 42). She appears in a couple of very adult-oriented scenes, so stay away if that deters you.<br /><br />Albert Finney plays the grieving and vengeful father.<br /><br />The story is akin to 1998's "A Simple Plan" in regards to a money-making scheme gone awry. The difference is that the loot in "A Simple Plan" was drug money from a crashed plan, which was basically up for grabs. Hence, the characters are never viewed as criminals by viewers. They're just regular folks taking advantage of a pot of gold thrown into their laps. Their lust for filthy lucre is their downfall. By contrast, the scheme in "Before the Devil..." is a clear-cut crime right out of the gate, even though Hoffman justifies it as victimless. With the possible exception of the wimpering Hawke character none of the people win the viewer's sympathy. They're getting exactly what they deserve.<br /><br />Another problem is the ending. The scenario in the hospital room is unrealistic. A 3-Star review by a physician (Judith S. Inouye, June 2, 2008) gives the details of why this entire scene is implausible. Check it out.<br /><br />That said, the film is expertly made. Roger Ebert gives it a perfect score. Some complain about the mixing of chronology, but I found it well done, interesting and easy-to-follow.<br /><br />The main problem is that the film revels in the worst in humanity. Take, for instance, Hawke's ex-wife who can't say one word to him without cussing and sheer antagonism. Or how about a peripheral character's brother who seeks to extort money from Hawke, an obnoxious tough guy who evidently thinks he's immortal? Or what about the father, Albert Finney: Can the tragic events be an opportunity for him to search his own heart and work toward positive changes, investigate the "sins of the fathers", discuss things, etc.? Forget it. With the possible exception of one character these people are too far gone.<br /><br />So what's the point? Don't commit crimes to make fast cash? Don't develop an expensive drug habit? Don't marry a selfish, unfaithful, materialistic woman? Don't marry a witch with a capital 'B'? The sins of the father will pass on and multiply? Arrogant tough guys must die? Perhaps all the above.<br /><br />"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a hard film to rate. It's well made and maintains your interest. Most importantly, it lingers with you, which is the main reason I recommend it. It offers wisdom to stay on the straight and narrow. But, come on, can't we have one person with redeemable qualities, even if it's an enlightened change of heart?<br /><br />I give it 4/5 Stars but I can understand why some rate it lower and others higher.</p></body></html>

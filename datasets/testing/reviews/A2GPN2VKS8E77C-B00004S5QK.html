I Can't Stop Singing The Song."></head><body><p>I just viewed this classic motion picture about the transition from silent films to talking pictures after seeing it, albeit severely edited, in my History Of Film class. I wanted to see it uncut and enjoy it for myself. I'm so glad my mom rented the film for me.  Gene Kelly co-directed this fantastic production with Stanley Donen, in addition to starring the the film. Joining him are Debbie Reynolds (my gosh, she was absolutely gorgeous and still is), Donold O'Connor, Jean Hagen ("Adam's Rib"), Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno (who would play the tragic princess, love-struck Tuptim in "Rodgers & Hammerstein's The King & I" and win an Academy Award in 1960 for Best Supporting Actress in "West Side Story.")<br /><br />The most popular sequence is when Gene Kelly is performing the title number in a street full of puddles; he had a 102 degree fever while filming the scen, but ever the professional, he didn't tell the producers or Stanley Donen until after he had finished filming the scene. He also choreographed the amazing dance sequences himself. My personal favorite musical numbers are "You Are My Lucky Star," "You Were Meant For Me" and, of course, "Singin' In The Rain." I can't stop singing it now and I love it.<br /><br />This is the way movies were made back then and, with the exception of Walt Disney Pictures and a few period films ("Ever After: A Cinderella Story," "Sense And Sensibility," "William Shakespeare's Hamlet" (1996), etc) the major studios in Hollywood don't make films like this anymore, which sucks. I recently wrote a paper on violence in the movies and how the graphic violence in films is causing kids to kill others (the Columbine massacre; in 1972, there was a nasty rape case in Britain that had odd similarities to a scene in "A Clockwork Orange" (a film that I never plan to see). The following is a sample of my conclusion to my paper (I got an A on it by the way, thank God).<br /><br />"Unless movies are based on classic literature ("Bram Stoker's Dracula,"<br />"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," etc) or a historical event (the horrible persecution of Christians in ancient Rome, the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., the sack of Rome in 1453 A.D., etc), movies with graphic violence should not be made; movies that use these things for source material only inspire interest in the literary work or historical event."<br /><br />The film is rated G, though it was made before the Motion Picture Association Of America (MPAA) was established in 1968. I highly recommend this excellent picture for film buffs & dance lovers everywhere.</p></body></html>

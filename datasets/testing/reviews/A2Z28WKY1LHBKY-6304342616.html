It has been repeated several times since: sometimes the aliens are destroyed by a virus, sometimes by Slim Whitman, but it's such a good plot that it's difficult to improve upon, and it's always been popular. So much for the plot. In this version the acting was good, and the dialogue was perfectly OK. The story moves along at a great pace, and there's always something interesting to gawp at. This is exactly what I like to see: heroes saving the world, baddies coming to bad ends, leaders leading from the front, family values and true love conquering. Just the stuff to fill in some time with a bit of escapist fantasy, humour and entertainment. Fortunately I'm not gifted with the genius of all those one-star reviewers, with their giant intellects, who are able to explain all the technical faults so excellently, but sometimes I think it's a bit funy that thy knt seme to spel to wel. I enjoyed this movie, but it wasn't quite as good as Robin Hood, which was much more realistic and credible. But better than Saving Private Ryan.</p></body></html>

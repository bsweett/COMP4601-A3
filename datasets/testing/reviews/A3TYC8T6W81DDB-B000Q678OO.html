<meta name="summary" content="A Taste of the Old Ultraviolence"></head><body><p>Alex DeLarge is your average eighteen year old boy...if by average, you mean he fully embraces the old ultraviolence and wanders the streets with his three droogs causing havoc and doing whatever he likes. Skipping school, breaking and entering, rape, assault...just another day in Alex's life. However, when a planned rape turns into an "accidental" murder, things start to turn fowl for Alex. His droogs turn on him and he winds up being caught by the police. He is then taken to a correctional facility where he spends the next few years, puts on the front that he's fully embraced the bible, and that he's now a changed man. But when word makes round of the experimental Ludovico treatment, Alex realizes his chance at freedom and jumps through the proper hoops to get out of the penitentiary he finds himself in and get into the experimental facility where he can be "cured." He is promised that he'll be a free man within a fortnight. The treatment consists of a drug known as Serum 114 being injected into the patient before making them sit through short films such as a man being beaten to a pulp, a woman being the sexual victim of several men, and a Nazi concentration camp film set to the soundtrack of Beethoven's ninth symphony. Alex begins to feel sick during the films and the doctors insist it's part of the cure. Alex's love for music and Beethoven in general become one of the adverse affects of the treatment as the ninth symphony has the same affect on Alex as the urge to beat or rape someone would. Alex soon comes to realize that you can never go home again and that being a free man isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially after a treatment such as this.<br /><br />It took me this long to finally sit down and watch this film. I have been told for months, maybe years, by friends that I need to see this because I'd enjoy it. I should have listened to those recommendations long ago because I did enjoy it. It is definitely an odd film. The film starts and it makes the viewer feel like they've missed something entirely that everyone else already knows about, but as the film unravels it snowballs into a unique vision of cinema. It kind of reminded me of Altered States, but I enjoyed this much more than Altered States. Even though A Clockwork Orange has a running time of well over two hours, it didn't feel that way. I wasn't glancing at the clock wondering when the film would end. The film didn't drag at all. It was odd, as I mentioned before, but it was interesting enough to keep my attention span throughout the entire film. That's something I take note of with the amount of films I sit through every week.<br /><br />The way the film looked and sounded was amazing, as well. Even though Clockwork is closing in on being forty years old, it sure doesn't look like it. Every scene had brilliant, vibrant colors that pretty much made every frame jump off the screen. The sound in the film was also near perfection. I was reading on IMDb that this was the first film take advantage of Dolby Digital surround sound and it shows.<br /><br />I also really love the way Kubrick shot this film. His sense of perspective is incredible. The long hallway shots and scenes that highlight an actors facial expressions are some of the most memorable scenes in the film and a lot of credit for that goes to the way he shot it. He's a director that I've come to realize I actually admire quite a bit, but need to actually see more of his work.<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell deserves a nod, as well. I doubt I'll be saying anything that hasn't already been said about him in this role, but humor me and pretend that this movie was just released on DVD or something. He makes the film and I'm not just saying that because he's in the lead role. I mean, it's hard to imagine A Clockwork Orange with another actor in McDowell's place. Malcolm McDowell is Alex DeLarge, period. Some of the speeches he gives along with the way he acts during and after the treatment process are some of the most memorable of any film I've sat through.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange is quite a unique trip, no matter how you look at it. It is weird and unusual, but is worth the watch since it's never actually boring. Kubrick's vision of the film could be the main reason to sit through it as it seems like every shot grabs your attention largely in part to its perspective. Arguably though, the film could be worth seeing due to being the film that Malcolm McDowell is best known for. Clockwork is a film I wouldn't recommend to anyone as I feel like it may not only go over some viewers heads, but soar over. It's for viewers with unique taste for cinema that are willing to sit down and actually pay attention to a film rather than be on the computer or do anything else while trying to watch a movie. A dramatic/science fiction/thriller that is not only viewed by some as one of the ten greatest films in the sci-fi genre but also one of the greatest films of all time.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10</p></body></html>

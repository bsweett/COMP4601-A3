<meta name="summary" content="Very good but very loose adaptation of the DC Vertigo comics."></head><body><p>In Los Angeles, chain-smoking John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a supernatural exorcist detective who went to hell originally but got his life back as now he hunts for demons and evil spirits to do good for heaven. After a mysterious suicide, Officer Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) helps Constantine battle the forces of evil.<br /><br />A well-made and well-acted if not entirely faithful adaptation of the popular cult DC/Vertigo comic book "Hellblazer: John Constanstine". It's a mix of H.P. Lovecraft-esque horror, fantasy and action combined with some dazzling special effects and an intriguing story, the main character is quite a complex and tragic hero that shows us the way to hell and heaven in this movie. It's a fascinating and dark film that's both fun and serious at the same time that i still recommended despite some flaws.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD has great extras like audio commentary, music video, trailers, deleted scenes with alternate ending, still galleries and featurettes.<br /><br />Also recommended: "The Exorcist", "Sin City", "Batman Begins", "The Crow", "Blade Runner", "Demons", "The Omen (1976)", "Daredevil", "Batman (1989)", "Batman Returns", "Evilspeak", "Ghostbusters", "Spawn (Animated)", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Hellraiser", "Hellbound: Hellraiser 2", "Silent Hill", "Dreamscape", "The Exorcism of Emily Rose", "V For Vendetta", "In The Mouth of Madness", "From Beyond", "End of Days", "Underworld", "Blade Trilogy", "Night Watch", "Day Watch", "Vampire Hunter D", "Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust", and "Ghost Rider".</p></body></html>

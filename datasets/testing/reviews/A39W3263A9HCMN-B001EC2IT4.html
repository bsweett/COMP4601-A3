<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, HORRIBLE DVD"></head><body><p>I love this movie and I bought it on VHS a long time ago. Recently I bought the regular PG version on DVD at my mom's store. The first thing i noteced was that the disc was double sided! about halfway thru I had to flip the disc over to watch the rest of the movie. and another thing: It was censored. I don't mean just the "violence" i mean language. Then I bought the PG-13 version hoping for a better verson. Instead I found out it was the same thing, just with a different cover. So i reccomend you buy the VHS.<br /><br />Trust me, it sucks.</p></body></html>

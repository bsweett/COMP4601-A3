<meta name="summary" content="Oh. My. God."></head><body><p>This psychological thriller descends into the realm of madness as Dr. Hannibal Lecter (encased in an escape-proof cage - but is it REALLY escape-proof?) establishes an unusual connestion with FBI agent Clarice Starling. She comes to him requesting his insight and help figuring out the criminally insane mind of a serial killer she's stalking. Lecter agrees to cooperate, but at a price...<br />Impecable performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster playing the leads.<br />Warning: Do Not Watch This Movie alone on a dark and rainy night. And take some Excedrin PM afterward, or you'll never get to sleep. Highest recommendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HORROR IN ALL IT'S BEAUTY!!!!!"></head><body><p>Dario Argento is in my opinion the MASTER of colors<br />in HORROR. Never has color looked so beautiful and<br />NEVER has Argento been so perfect.  Argento's MASTERPIECE<br />SUSPIRIA tells of the TERROR that befalls American ballet<br />student Harper when she attends the celebrated Tanz Akademie<br />at Frieberg,Germany. After several murders,a maggot infestation<br />and rumors of witchcraft(all in one movie,don't you just love it)<br />Jessica discovers that the school is a haven for a witch dubbed<br />the Black Queen. From its shocking opening double-murder to its<br />fiery finish,this is Sir Argento's finest film! Full of lush<br />colors,bizarre set design,and very loud EERIE Goblin music<br />A MUST OWN!</p></body></html>

They have a little problem in with the crash landing. This kills two of the three residents in their stasis pods right away and trashes the synthetic Bishop beyond salvage ability,<br />This leaves Ripley sitting amongst the residents of a prison planet that has been tucked away and forgotten. Still, she's safe because there aren't any creatures on this rock, right? Unbeknownst to her or the residents of this unarmed rock (unless you call a few flares, some flammable liquid, and some hand tools having weaponry), however, she did bring a little bundle of joy into the fold here and, more importantly, she herself finds that perhaps, in this big misadventure, that she has finally managed to step into a pothole of gargantuan proportions.<br />As far as the Alien series (or Legacy, as the box set indicates) goes, this movie is oftentimes cast off as something that is worth forgetting. In many ways this is because it is a reversion toward the die cast in the first movie and forgotten in the second, where only one alien menaces a group of people instead of an armada of them and where the people find themselves without enough "heat" to "pack." Still, being a fan of the idea and of the furthering of the Alien concept, I didn't exactly see it in that light. Instead of seeing it as a reversion in any sense, I saw the storyline as something that explored the outskirts of the society that they had landed within as it explored how the people managed to get along and the power structure involved therein. This touched on their belief system, the fact that even a hairless (because of the little Lice problem that the planet has) Ripley can be considered a supermodel amongst a colony of forgotten "lifers," and that they find someone shouting "Xeno" much the same as anyone else would. Further, it explores the way the Alien adapts to its host, showing you the body difference in the beasties that come from the atypical human model vs. something that manages to come from an animal like a dog. With the dogburster this requires a little creative ingenuity and it looked pretty good, holding the characteristics of its kind and its host's body type quite nicely.<br />The only problems I had with the whole thing was that Newt, someone we had to watch salvaged from the jaws of a Queen in the 2nd installation, is dead on arrival and doesn't really give while the giving is good, and that the Alien's view is sometimes shot through its eyes. Personally, I thought this was something of an insult to the people that watched Ripley trudge through the depths of LV-426 for what amounted to futility, and I wanted to see something tragic happen besides drowning in a stasis chamber. Also, the view of the alien, while interesting when it's running up walls, is something that you have to be in the mood for. It does add an odd prospective to the viewing, but I'd sometimes like to watch the man and monstrosity meet in an awe-inspiring puddle of fear-driven demise.<br />This is a movie that I like in quite a few ways, but that I know isn't exactly the most embraced chapter in the storyline. It doesn't involve the dripping of acidic blood in most of its chapters, the alien decides to check in and say hello when it feels the need, and you really don't get anything like you did in Aliens. So, saying that you will or won't like it is something of a rocky road. If you were a fan of the first two then you should get this one,also.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Sigourney Weaver, the slimy reptillian creature and the alien quadrilogy.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008</p></body></html>

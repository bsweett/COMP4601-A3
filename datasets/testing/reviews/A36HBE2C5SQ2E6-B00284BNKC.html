But, no matter what, they still maintain that happiness because they have nothing else to hold onto. They all still cling onto it even though their lives are thrown into a fiery downfall.<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky has made one of the best films of the 90's. He hits you hard with his sensory-based direction. He makes you react to what is being shown on the screen with a gut thudding motion that would make the strongest man cry. He has mastered the art of showing people that are all good then sends their lives into a tumbling downfall. His direction is wild and all over the place, and he does the direction with such an artistry that you can't help but merzmerized by what is going on the screen.<br /><br />Delusions of Grandour come to mind when we look at these characters. We feel some sort of pain when we watch these characters go ahead and form a niche in making their life worse until the point where they cannot turn back and realize all of the mistakes that they are making. It self induces pity from us towards the characters. We feel things when we watch the film.<br /><br />We don't even realize what we are watching till the end when we tell ourselves how we like this film.<br /><br />In my personal opinon, I was watching a mastery of filmaking. I formed that we all have our own dreams and reality that we hold onto no matter how much pain, torment, trouble or feeling that we have towards our life, we hold onto the dream no matter what. Dreams can be ruined by what we do and the mistakes that we make.<br /><br />I enjoyed this wonderful piece of film making, because it shows us a harsh and brutal reality.</p></body></html>

Where other heist-based films push the button for unremitting tension, THE ITALIAN JOB combines sleekly written dialogue and character interaction which makes all of the tension scenes (and there are plenty) all the more credible.  The photography of the inevitable car chases and 'inside shots' of the capers is terrific, with the scenes set in Venice, Italy among the best.  The cast is electrically charged without that all too familiar over-the-top push.  Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron (father/daughter team) are superb, and Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G establish a comraderie that is destined to overcome their betraying partner Edward Norton.  With a cast like this you almost don't need a script, but the writing has a fine balance of bite and wit.  For sheer explosive entertainment by a crew of winners this movie is among the best in this genre.</p></body></html>

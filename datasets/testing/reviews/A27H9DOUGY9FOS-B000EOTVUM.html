<meta name="summary" content="A Surprisingly Intelligent Foray Into Torture Cinema"></head><body><p>This Australian exercise in sadism may also be the biggest, most pleasant surprise I've had in quite some time (at the risk of alienating anyone--pleasant is an odd choice of words for this film)!  Expecting little, I found much to appreciate in "Wolf Creek"--a potent entry in the slasher/torture genre.<br /><br />First of all, the film is practically a masterpiece compared to recent American films with similarly nasty themes.  Without a Chad Michael Murray, Paris Hilton, Amber Tamblyn, or other fresh faced TV-ready star in place, "Wolf Creek" already starts out at an advantage.  Here, we get a young trio on vacation.  They like to party hard, but unlike their American counterpoints, they speak and interact believably without that self-aware dialogue that plagues many modern horror films.  You get to know them, the build up and character development is admirable.  In fact, there is one scene where two of the characters tentatively kiss.  It's well played and very sweet.  How often have you said that when watching a film for its gore content?  Maybe never.<br /><br />Once the torment begins, I was invested in these three kids.  I wasn't wishing them to be dispatched--say like in "Hostel" when I was thrilled to see our obnoxious horndogs put to the knife (of course, they were cartoons not characters)--no I wanted our heroes here to persevere.  And every action and reaction is credible!  When they can help a friend, they try.  If they can't, they don't.  And they take every opportunity to escape.  This is not a witless exercise.  Logical choices are made--for good or bad result.  So this played out in a very real, very unexpected way--I was surprised by the outcome several times as we got closer to the end.  I can't give it much higher praise than that.<br /><br />One cliche, however, that seems to extend across all borders--the rural caricature.  Be it the Australian Outback or the American backwoods, those unfortunate enough to inhabit these desolate countries are depicted as mentally challenged an/or bullying rednecks!<br /><br />I think this film could appeal to an audience outside typical slasher films.  There is a resourcefulness and intelligence that make this distinct from a lot of Hollywood product.  It's a tale of survival as much as anything.  But obviously, there is brutality and unpleasantness.  Approach with caution, and you might be rewarded!  KGHarris, 10/06.</p></body></html>

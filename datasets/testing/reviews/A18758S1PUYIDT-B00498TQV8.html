<meta name="summary" content="A teen's struggle to survive"></head><body><p>This is an unusual story of a teenage girl who must care for her depressed mother and younger siblings after her dad supposedly dies.  Problem: the bail bonds guy and police don't believe he is dead, so she has to try to find him and prove whether he is alive or dead.  If he is still alive, there is another problem: their house will be seized and they will be left to die in the cold hills of Missouri, where life is rough and the citizens are unforgiving.<br /><br />Great performances by Jennifer Lawrence and the others.  Good soundtrack and foreboding locations too.</p></body></html>

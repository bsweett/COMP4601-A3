And yet here I sit typing about the latest thrill ride featuring the character portrayed excellently by Bruce Willis as he battles the newest form of terrorism, cyber terrorists.<br /><br />Computer whiz Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Oliphant) has assembled pieces of a master planned puzzle by putting to use information garnered via internet and computer hacker geniuses. Unbeknownst to each, they are a giving him the tools needed to take down the country and increase his bank account at the same time. The best way to cover his tracks is to eliminate each one, which he does.<br /><br />Enter McClane who has been asked to pick up one of these hackers, Matthew Farrell (Justin Long), for the FBI for questioning when a hack on their systems is discovered. A normal pick up turns ugly when mercenaries show to make sure that Farrell never gets a chance to talk to the Feds. One raging gun battle later and McClane and Farrell are on the road and looking for help.<br /><br />Gabriel launches his attack in the midst of Farrell's being taken into custody, cutting into the traffic control system of Washington, D.C. and then into the entire broadcasting network system to create hysteria across the country. Locating McClane and Farrell, he dispatches a helicopter as well as rerouting traffic while the pair is in a tunnel. What follows is one fantastic assemblage of stunt coordination and special effects to make your adrenaline pump faster than a tossed car.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, the duo attempt to find out exactly what it was that Farrell helped assemble with his one small part. Attacks on the power system that controls the entire east coast, a computer area that holds more knowledge than it should and the kidnapping of McClane's college aged daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) turn things personal. Is there any doubt that a final face off between McClane and Gabriel will take place?<br /><br />This movie is not to be believed. No one could take the physical punishment that McClane does. No one can jump from an out of control jet onto a crumbling bridge and expect to survive. No one could dodge a car rolling through the air. And yet the answer is in front of you all the time...WHO CARES? This movie is not about actual physics or honest solutions to national problems. This movie is a roller coaster ride that gets the blood pumping, that makes you root for the good guy and that is nothing more than pure fun filled entertainment.<br /><br />The actors do their best between performing and being replaced by stuntmen when the danger ensues. Along with these stunt men and special effects people, they make this one fun flick to watch. Probably not suited for the youngest members of your house, but for everyone else, this movie is a blast and one worth adding to your collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good,but cluttered"></head><body><p>the Problem with alot of films today is that they often try to be too much to everyone&miss the most important part:making any sense. Kevin Costner does a good job here. this film feels like about 3-4 films that i have seen over the past few years tied together.it gets heavy handed in spots&then shifts into more Humor.sometimes it can't make up it's mind what it wants to be.the story has moments though.</p></body></html>

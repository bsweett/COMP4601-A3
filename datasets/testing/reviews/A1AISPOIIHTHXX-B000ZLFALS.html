Starting out with male lead Jim Sturgess singing directly to camera, a bit of snickering came from the crowd. Not quite the response the film would eventually garner but filmgoers were rather unsure of what to make of the film with some loving it while others either hated it or didn't even bother to go see it. While the film isn't one of those "best films no one saw", it's kind of surprising how lukewarm the reaction was.<br /><br />The story's really a cliche love story set in the 60's with the use of Beatles' songs for narrative or just coloring. But a more detailed story is that Jude, a British worker, travels to America to find his father and on the way meets Max, a wild do-whatever-I-want kid who comes from a rich but stuck-up kind of family. Jude meets Lucy, a girl who just recently lost her boyfriend in the war in Vietnam and the 2 end up falling in love. But with the war going on and Lucy getting motivated and Max getting drafted, the 2 have to stick together...all the while singing Beatle songs.<br /><br />For the life of me, I could never get into musicals. Aside from Disney films, I couldn't get past the idea that characters would all of a sudden break into song and dance but with the Beatles catalogue as the songs, it's not all that bad. Sung by the actors, the songs get different interpretations that in some cases, and this is gonna turn heads,("blasphemer!"), is even better than the originals. Songs such as "Dear Prudence", the title and "Strawberry Fields Forever" strangely just sound better and the actors do good jobs; Sturgess particular with his sort-of Beatles-y vocal tone and Dana Fuchs with her Joplin-esque wail. However, some don't work such as "For the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" which is not only way too strange looking but it doesn't even feel like a song and it drags the pace while "With a Little Help From My Friends" and "Come Together" could've been taken out as well.<br /><br />But this is a film and to that end, it's sort of a polarizing one since on one hand it's visually inventive with tons of strange, abstract and even beautiful images and on other occasions it's long, nothing in terms of character development and it even runs a little long. Then there's other just strange stuff as having characters named after Beatle songs (Hey Jude, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, Dear Prudence, Doctor Robert), 60's references (Jojo and his Hendrix look/sound) and odd character/song use such as the character Prudence singing "I Want to Hold Your Hand" to a fellow cheerleader implying an unrequited lesbian attraction which she then feels towards Sadie which then gets dropped out completely.<br /><br />As I was nearing the end of the film, one thought struck my mind: I could rewatch this again one day. While some might hate it and I don't necessarily love it, I wouldn't mind owning it.</p></body></html>

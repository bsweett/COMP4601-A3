It's you typical post apocolypse movie with a big enough star on it to sell. For full out gratification seek out the cult classic 28 days later by Danny Boyle, not '...Weeks later' though! Weeks is the sequel. This movie could have been so much better. The mutants, the main character, the story all could have been vamped up and kicked everyone's A@@'s out of their seats. And I hear NewLine's out of business, but hell, if they had gotten their hands on this it would have been epic. Bob Shaye would have poured millions into it and properly hired Weta to do the effects and voila, magnifique!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What A Powerful Tribute To Bob Marley & A Great Movie To Boot!"></head><body><p>There's lot of Bob Marley in this film. My favorite line was the Bob Marley quote  about why he was going to perform TWO days  after being shot in an assassination attempt: "The bad people in the world never take a rest, so neither can I." Bob Marley believed that music and love could change and heal the world. He was a true visionary, and I'm so very glad his very important message has not been forgotten by Hollywood! Playing various tunes from his Legend album makes Bob Marley's dream for peace all that more poignant!<br /><br />I'm a fan of the original Omega Man film with Charleston Heston. Over the years I have watched it about a dozen times. I never tire of it! This remake pays homage to the original. But it's a very, very different interpretation. For example in the original film it was a biological warfare agent that got loose in the world. Now it's a genetically engineered virus to cure cancer that caused the destruction of the human race. In other words - biotechnology does us all in!<br /><br />"I Am Legend" also made me squirm because other than the occasional Bob Marley tune, so much of this film had zero music or sound effects. After a while you felt the Will Smith character's  mind-boggling loneliness. This is first, and foremost, a psychological film. Even the movie theater audience barely made a sound! The filmmakers had tremendous courage not to dumb the story down to the level of  adolescent boys. I have been begging Hollywood for years  to make a Sci-Fi film suitable for the mature adult mind - so thank you! You've done it!<br /><br />My favorite scene was the very last one. It showed how civilization can survive  in the future - by being self-sufficient. Keep an eye out for the ultra-modern windmills and solar panels. The scene only lasts a few seconds, but it speaks volumes!<br /><br />This film will be watched a 100 years from now! It's that good!</p></body></html>

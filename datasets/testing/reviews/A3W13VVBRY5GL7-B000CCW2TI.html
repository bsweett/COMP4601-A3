<meta name="summary" content="Way above-average, certainly no B-Movie..."></head><body><p>In 'Red Eye', we have Cillian Murphy starring as a Seemingly-Nice-Ne'er-Do-Well, alongside newbie Rachel McAdams' surprisingly fluid portrayal of an anally retentive hotel manageress, whose devotion to her job and her father make her the ideal scapegoat for a team of assassins intent on ending the life of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. With Wes Craven taking the directorial helm, one could be forgiven for writing this off as an obvious and unrewarding cash-in on the new paranoia surrounding airline travel - but, surprisingly enough, Craven, alongside the excellent pairing of Murphy and McAdam, has managed to craft a tight, tense and wholly captivating thriller out of what could so easily have been 'Flight Plan's poor cousin.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy is just like Johnathan Rhys-Myers; he's Irish, he's beautiful, he's great at accents, and he's able to turn on a dime from hero to villain. There's one major difference between Murphy and Rhys-Myers, though: Murphy has talent, he can act. He makes for a compelling villain here - the script offers no explanation for the actions of his would-be terrorist character Jackson Rippner, but Murphy's superior characterisation skills make for an enigmatic and menacing sort of villain. McAdams as the hapless-yet-plucky heroine Lisa Reisert is excellent - for a new star, she certainly displays a wealth of talent that belies her relatively scant experience. Sympathetic, energetic and totally watchable, I'm very interested to see just how the next few years of her career turn out - if this movie is anything to go by, she, like Murphy, seems to be headed for great things.<br /><br />Wes Craven is something of a revelation behind the camera here - personally, I haven't seen him do anything really original or standout since 1996's 'Scream' - but his fast pacing and skillful management of the action scenes make 'Red Eye' a definite success. There's a real sense of claustrophobia in the on-board turbulence and take-off sequences, and the penultimate scenes at the hotel and at Reisert's home are totally compelling. Not in the same league as "Fatal Attraction", perhaps, but top-notch stuff nonetheless.<br /><br />All in all, 'Red Eye' is a great movie, and does what any good action thriller ought to do: it's fun, fast and riveting, and is a very definite recommendation.</p></body></html>

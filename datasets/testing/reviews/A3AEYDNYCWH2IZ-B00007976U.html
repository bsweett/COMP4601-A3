Having just watched One Hour Photo I can no longer make such a claim. Director/Writer Mark Romanek has brought out the very best in Robin Williams who, in my estimation, delivers his most significant performance to date. Williams subtley brings a creepiness to the screen in a character the likes of which one would not have though him capable of playing. The film keeps viewers on edge for its entire running time and manages to deliver a few honestly funny moments. I would recommend this film to anyone in the mood for darker than normal fare.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Couple's therapy anyone?"></head><body><p>Though probably labled a 'chick flick', this does have something for both genders. I imagine they'll start showing it in couple's therapy. However, it's not all drama, there is some comedy in there so guy's don't despair if your gal brings it home. There's the typical struggles between man and woman, only intensified with a twist of comedy. The creepy thing is they could've been making a movie about many couple's past relationships. It did remind me of a few. It has a bitter-sweet ending, not the one I expected, but worth watching. I especially love the character 'Marilyn Dean'. It's a shame her sassy role was only used briefly in one movie.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

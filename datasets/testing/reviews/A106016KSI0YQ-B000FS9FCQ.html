They bring a depth to the material through their acting that would otherwise be very much lacking. Portman's finely felt work here as the heroine Evey is a revelation, given her woodenness in the recent Star Wars trilogy, but the real acting honors must go to Weaving, who wears a plastic Guy Fawkes mask thoughout the entire film in his role as the dashing Shakespeare-quoting freedom fighter (or terrorist, depending on your perspective): all his acting has to be done without the benefit of facial expression, and damned if Weaving doesn't make an actor's showcase of of the part nonetheless and invest it with multiple dimensions.<br /><br />The concept of both the film and the graphic novel involves the political resistance of a masked swashbuckler in a totalitarian Britain of the very near future: its resonances in the wake of 9/11 and the Patriot Act are quite strong. The film's visuals are actually a bit heavyhanded: the evil High Chancellor (John Hurt, in an atypical scenery-chewing performance) communicates with his council of lackeys via closed-circuit TV in scenes reminiscent of the famous "1984" Apple Super Bowl commercial, while his rise to power is documented in clips that almost exactly evoke the Nuremberg rallies documented in "Triumph of the Will." The film's scenic designer seems to have felt his audience would be so dim that even THAT wouldn't be enough, and so the Chancellor's Norsefire Party uses as a color scheme black with red accents, as in a Satanic Black Mass. But the intelligence behind Alan moore's original conception for the work overrides this, and Weaving and Portman greatly redeem the material. This special 2-disc DVD features a short on the making of the film's visual look (the producers and director and scenic director seem intent on convincing us that what they've done with it really brilliant, which seems funny in a film all about propaganda), another on the original Moore/Lloyd graphic novel and the new wave of comics, and a third on the historical underpinnings of this film in the Gunpowder Plot and Guido "Guy" Fawkes.</p></body></html>

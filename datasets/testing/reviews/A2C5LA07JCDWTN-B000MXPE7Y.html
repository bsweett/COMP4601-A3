Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a priviledged Yale graduate and former Skull and Bones member who is recruited to help the United States stave off the growing threat of communism both to our East and later our South. The movie centers around the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and how and why our mission in Cuba failed. Much of the film is told through flashbacks as Wilson trys to determine how and why this mission has failed. The pacing of the film is slow, but the plot is layered, intricate and engrossing. Damon does an admirable job as Edward Wilson, he is as cold and calculating a character as I can ever remember on the screen. A man of very few words even when it comes to his wife and child. Obviously this affects his marriage but the film thankfully does not overbear on this point. For anyone whose read about CIA interrogation tactics, this movie will not shock or surprise you. Overall, a look inside of one of the most secretive organizations in American history should be reason enough for you to see this film, but if it's not then the superb acting and direction of De Niro will nonetheless draw you to see The Good Shepherd.<br /><br />Best Line EVER:<br /><br />Joseph Palmi (as played by Joe Pesci): The Italians we have our families and our kids, the Irish have their homeland, the Jews have their traditions, even the N----rs have their music...what do you people have?<br /><br />Edward Wilson (as played by Matt Damon): We have the United States of America, the rest of you are all visiting.</p></body></html>

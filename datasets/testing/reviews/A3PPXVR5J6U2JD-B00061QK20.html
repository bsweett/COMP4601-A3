<meta name="summary" content="Who Moved My Hero?"></head><body><p>Red version: Hero is the story of one man's quest (Nameless, played by Jet Li) to destroy the three assassins (lovers Broken Sword played by Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Flying Snow played by Maggie Cheung, and Sky played by Donnie Yen) who tried to kill the King of Qin (Chen Daoming).  Nameless bests Sky in combat, and Broken Sword and Flying Snow betray each other, all the while fighting off the King's entire army, until Nameless finally kills Snow. At least, that's the story Nameless tells the King, who is privileged with advancing within ten paces of him.<br /><br />Blue version: The King disagrees.  He knows the assassin lovers and doesn't believe the story. He instead believes that the three assassins sacrificed their own lives to allow Nameless the audience with the King, and thus a chance to commit regicide himself. He has developed a special move, the King theorizes, that can kill a man at ten paces.<br /><br />White version: Now the truth comes out.  Nameless explains who he is, where he came from, and why he is in the King's palace. Nameless has a technique that can skewer a person while missing all their vital organs, making the blow look fatal. He used it on Sky and he uses it again on Flying Snow. Surprisingly, Broken Sword is against the entire notion of assassinating the King at all, a decision that harkens back to the duo's first assassination attempt. It failed only because Broken Sword chose not to kill the King.<br /><br />Throughout the movie parallels are made between calligraphy and martial arts, and specifically the symbol for the word "sword." There are deeper meanings within the brush strokes, a form of enlightenment that Broken Sword achieved and that the King discovers in his conversation with his would-be assassin. Nameless' decision and the effect it has on the other assassins provides the twist to the tale.<br /><br />Hero is a breathtaking movie, filled with balletic martial arts, lovely scenes in vivid colors, and natural settings reflecting China's ancient history and beauty.  It's entertaining and moving, and the relationship between Broken Sword and Flying Snow anchors the piece.  The three different tales, each depicted by a particular color scheme, provides different backdrops for heroics, drama, and warfare.<br /><br />On the other hand, Hero is a Chinese cinematic version of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399144463">Who Moved My Cheese</a>" - it reinforces the status quo with a sinister charm.  Killing kings is foolish, says Hero, because it only leads to more war.  Nameless' decision is one of sacrifice, one for the many.  Were this only a fable, the story wouldn't be politically charged.  But the King of Qin went on to become the Emperor of China, who did a lot of great things.  So, you know, killing him would be bad because China wouldn't be nearly as great without him.<br /><br />The question becomes whether or not that matters on a greater moral scale.  Hero clearly makes the point that we should feel sympathy for the poor King in his enlightened state. Revenge never gets anyone anywhere. And yet by reducing the course of history to the assassination of one man, Hero makes many assumptions: about the importance of said man, about the progress of China, about our own human failings.  It's a very Chinese movie, which makes it either more authentic or less palatable to American audiences. It all depends on your definition of the term "hero."</p></body></html>

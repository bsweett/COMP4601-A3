I did happen to like certain aspects of it and liked certain characters more than others. I could have done without a 10 year old rapper kid jibber-jabbering about being a prophet.<br />  This movie really reminded me a lot of Crash, or maybe because Magnolia actually came first Crash really reminded me of it. The movie seems to be a primer in the chaos theory. The famous example of chaos theory being if a butterfly flaps its wings on one side of the world it causes typhoons on the other side of the world, or maybe big fat bullfrogs raining from the sky. A lot of movies seem to want explore this degree of separation theory. I am getting a bit over it as they say.<br />  Everyone except Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds was in Magnolia from Boogie Nights, I began to wonder if the just didn't have the script reading on the same day.<br />  Overall I think this movie was well thought out, but a bit too convoluted and maybe just too many characters with too many sub-plots.<br />I gave it 3 and half stars.</p></body></html>

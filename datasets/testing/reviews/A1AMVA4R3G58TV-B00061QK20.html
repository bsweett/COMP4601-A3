<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful Film"></head><body><p>Hero is a beautiful and stunning film. The cinematography is outstanding. And just seeing the landscapes of the Chinese countryside are breath-taking.<br /><br />I have to admit for me the story was alittle hard to follow. The subtitles moved alittle to fast in places, and I missed some of it. In certain scenes I may have been looking at the beautiful<br /><br />landscapes and just missed the subtitles. And the same story is told in three different versions so it does not flow continuously.<br /><br />The special effects were also amazing. And these were done in such a way that they added to the beauty of the film.</p></body></html>

I rented it anyway and I was very pleased with the viewing experience. Not to delve too deeply into it, there is some amazing star power in this talent pool. From Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman, on to Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci and down to Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu- there are plenty of excellent performances to go around.<br /><br />This movie is similar to many others you've seen, no doubt. There is a crazy back and forth plot happening and all is revealed at the end, after many twists and turns. The difference is that this time, it is actually interesting along the way - AND the ending actually comes together and ultimately makes sense.<br /><br />I would recommend the movie. It's  interesting and it should be able to keep you entertained for 109 minutes.</p></body></html>

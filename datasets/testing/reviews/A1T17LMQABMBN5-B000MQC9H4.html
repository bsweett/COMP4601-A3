<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful, feel-good film!"></head><body><p>I am not a big Nancy Meyers fan, but I did enjoy What Women Want and thought I'd give this a whirl.  The Holiday is a sweet, feel-good romantic movie that impresses in some areas and underwhelms in others.  More on that later. Amanda (Cameron Diaz), a creator of movie trailers from L.A., has just broken up with her boyfriend and wants to get away and be alone for a while. Iris (Kate Winslet), a London newspaper writer, is heartbroken as well.  The man, a colleague, she loves and has pined over for years has become engaged to another woman and she wants to put some distance between them.  So when Amanda finds a home exchange travel program on the Internet (using Google, a very obvious product placement ad within the film) and finds the perfect vacation spot -- a small, picturesque cottage in Surrey, England -- she contacts the owner (Iris) and they agree to trade places for a couple of weeks.  Iris has the time of her life in L.A., where she meets some interesting people (including a retired screenwriter played by veteran actor Elli Wallach) and becomes friends with a sweet film music composer (Jack Black), whereas Amanda is bored out of her mind... until she meets Iris's gorgeous and enigmatic brother (Jude Law).<br /><br />This is the sort of movie you either want to enjoy with your girlfriends or watch by yourself when you're in the mood for something warm and fuzzy.  The script is well written and it isn't the typical romantic comedy in that the characters are one-dimensional for the most part.  In this film, you get moving performances, especially from Kate Winslet.  She once again showcases her talent in this one and her character's kindness and transparency to loving and caring for others is wonderful.  I was also impressed with the fact that she and Black had chemistry.  I often avoid a Jack Black movie like the plague, but he was actually endearing in this film.  Cameron Diaz underwhelms as Amanda though.  She played a character not unlike most of her romantic comedy heroines.  Even though I liked the chemistry between her and Jude Law, I found myself more interested in Winslet and Black.  As for the setting, I loved the beautiful takes of Iris's English cottage and the village she lives in.  They were so much more eye-catching than the mansions and palm trees in Los Angeles.  All in all, this is a great film.  The DVD is not that great though.  The picture quality is not that great and you don't get any special features (at least not the one I got).  I recommend you rent this one before you decide to own it.</p></body></html>

If you leave the lights on, you will find that you can barely see what's going on. So much of the action is shot in the dark that you will find yourself squinting and getting seasick. The action is OK, but the first hour of the extended version is pretty boring. Much of the dialogue and story are copied from Alien, Aliens and Predator. The Rock is entertaining and the musical score also rocks. Brace yourself for the seizure-inducing action sequences that copy the video game (you are the camera, running down corridors, shooting cannibal zombies); it's migraine time.</p></body></html>

I personally have yet to truly make up my mind about it.  Do I think it's an epically-drawn sci-fi piece, or an ego-driven effort into heady ideas and special effects?  I can't tell you.  Probably because, truthfully, it's both.<br /><br />The plot begins simply enough: a pair of scientists discover ancient cave drawings that they feel point toward a distant planet.  This planet may or may not hold the secret to life on Earth.  The scientists gain funding, a crew, and a spaceship, and head toward said planet.  Bad things happen when they get there.  Very bad things.<br /><br />There's a lot of good to be said in PROMETHEUS's favor.  The acting is solid; mainstays Charlize Theron, Noomie Rapace, Guy Pearce, and Logan Marshall-Green deliver solid, if not altogether memorable, performances.  Idris Elba is a standout in his supporting role.  Undoubtedly the best thing to be said about the film, everything else aside, is Michael Fassbender's performance as the LAWRENCE OF ARABIA-loving android David.  Fassbender has Peter O'Toole down pat, quoting him left and right in a near-perfect imitation, while keeping his character ambiguous and vaguely threatening (think Lance Henriksen's Bishop, but British).  Fassbender possibly deserves an Oscar nom for this one...but then, he usually does.<br /><br />Other good things: cinematography, special effects, overall ideology.  This film was a labor of love, and it truly shows.  There are some shocking scenes; there are some funny scenes; there are some touching and haunting scenes.  Bad thing: these scenes don't necessarily congeal.  Or maybe they do.  It depends if you buy into the overall goal of the movie, the point that it either makes or doesn't make (depending on how close attention you pay to details and plot holes).  The script is decidedly lackluster; it's bland and cliched, especially in dialogue.  Where the film excels is ideas.  The question is whether those ideas are carried out effectively.<br /><br />MILD SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW (though I give nothing away that I didn't know going into the film; if you are overly cautious, skip to the final paragraph).<br /><br />Here's the thing: PROMETHEUS tries to do too much.  It's a sci-fi adventure film; it's a borderline-theology piece; it's needlessly a part of the ALIEN universe (as though director Ridley Scott forced his writers to add that in there); it's a commentary on the human desire to know everything, and the consequences that come with such knowledge.  It is all of these things separately; it is rarely all of these things together.  There are many great ideas buried at the core of PROMETHEUS; Scott and company mine deep enough to give us a glimpse of most of these, but rarely go far enough to fully dig them out of the ground.<br /><br />Ultimately, whether you enjoy PROMETHEUS is based on your ability to suspend disbelief, open your mind, and marvel in what is otherwise a solid B-movie with A-list special effects and talent behind it.  If you can't do that, don't fret--PROMETHEUS doesn't work hard to make you to believe.  Instead, it bombards you with ideas.  It's supposedly the first of three films, so hopefully the second entry will settle all of the unanswered questions, and perhaps explain many of the plot holes.  (Though again: shouldn't this film answer all of its own questions?)</p></body></html>

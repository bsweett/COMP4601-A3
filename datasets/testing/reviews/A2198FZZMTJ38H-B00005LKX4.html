So much does director Ridley Scott push the envelope with excessive bloodshed and drawn out sequences, that he loses touch with the magic of the first film, that which made the hairs on our neck stand up. The film is well acted and grand in scale, but without a familiar sense of dread and mystery to keep us intrigued, it chews itself to pieces. <p>The film kicks into gear with a chase sequence that looks like a deleted scene from Scott's earlier film, &quot;Gladiator,&quot; as Clarice Starling, now played by Julianne Moore, guns down a well-known drug ring operator. Her conduct in apprehending the suspect gets her demoted, and for a good hour or so of the movie, she will spend most of her time rummaging through files on Hannibal Lecter, reprised by Anthony Hopkins, who escaped from the law at the end of the previous film. <p>Her investigation leads her to Mason Verger, one of Lecter's victims, who is out for revenge. Verger is played by Gary Oldman, who is probably doomed to look like someone other than himself in any role he plays. His promise of a hefty reward catches the eye of an Italian police officer, who has spotted the famed cannibal masquerading as an art collector in Italy. He intends to turn Lecter in to Verger, ignoring the constant warnings from Starling and unaware of the real danger involved in meddling in Lecter's life. <p>The setup is good, but the execution and payoff are constantly tedious. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; had a low-key feel to it, something not quite so Hollywood or glossy. Director Jonathan Demme was able to evoke genuine suspense and tension through his photography, the fittingly creepy and downtrodden score of Howard Shore, and through the unconventional and frightening connection between its two lead characters, Lecter and Clarice. <p>Ridley Scott gives &quot;Hannibal&quot; all the guts (literally), grandeur and Hollywood glitz money can buy, something that this sequel does not need; in fact, it's a diminishing trait. His attention to cheap thrills with the use of violence and gory murders ruins the effect that Hannibal Lecter has on us. In the first film, he was frightening because of his ability to penetrate Clarice's mind, and through that, he found escape. Here, he is free to roam the Earth without worry, and witnessing his violence, I lost what little respect I had for him. <p>This attention to gloss diminishes any mystery or intensity we may have had in the beginning. Unlike &quot;Lambs,&quot; which kept its secrets until the blazing, bloody end, &quot;Hannibal&quot; has no secrets to reveal. Starling's hunt for Lecter turns into a cat-and-mouse hunt, which comes too little to late towards the film's end. Those of us who know the relationship these two character had in the beginning know full well that any filmmaker would sooner hang himself than deny us a final confrontation involving the two. This confrontation is the cheese atop the cracker, a finale that is more laughable than it is horrific, and further decimates the connection of these two muddled souls. <p>Anthony Hopkins still churns out a very kinetic performance as Lecter, employing wit and intelligence through his character. We may never feel anything for the new Lecter, but the old Hopkins has not changed a bit since his days behind a pane of glass. Julianne Moore takes over where Jodie Foster left off; her acting is wonderful. In fact, it's not really Foster that we miss, but the traits of her character from the previous outing. This Clarice is given little to go on, and doesn't grab the audience's attention quite like the past Clarice. <p>High hopes and high expectations abound, &quot;Hannibal&quot; became one of 2001's most anticipated films, and one of its biggest disappointments as well. It's mind-boggling to see just how much cinema has changed in the last decade; &quot;Lambs&quot; is genuine, while &quot;Hannibal&quot; is standard fodder.</p></body></html>

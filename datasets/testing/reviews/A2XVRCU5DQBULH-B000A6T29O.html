Loaded with nonstop action and thrilling fun, Angelina Jolie plays the very sexy Lara Croft, a british chick with an attitude. She uncovers the secret of an ancient legend hidden in a mysterious clock. Now it's a race against time as she must go against fellow archaeologists to find an all-powerful triangle. Great special effects, great direction from Simon West, and some high-flyin' explosive action mixed with the seductiveness of Jolie make this film an adventure-fans weapon of choice.</p></body></html>

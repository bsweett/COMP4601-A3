<meta name="summary" content="Mary Poppins is Still MAGIC After all these 40 Years!"></head><body><p>I received a special preview copy of the 40th anniversary of Marry Poppins DVD edition. I must say I spend two whole days reviewing the special features. It is amazing and a must have DVD for the Holidays and all year long.<br /><br />This DVD edition is remastered in the DISNEYS' THX home Theatre set up. The audio is incredible and the restored print is amazing bright, vibrant and textured. The movies are toted as Walt's best achievement ever. And it has everything you would want in a film for the entire family including a break down of sing-a-long songs.<br /><br />40th Anniversary DVD contains:<br /><br />A special audio commentary track with the none other than Academy Award Winning JULIE ANDREWS (The Sound of Music, The Princess Diaries, 10) and DICK VAN DYKE (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Bye Bye Birdie, The Dick Van Dyke Show) themselves. Reminiscing about the music, production and even Mr. Walt Disney himself. Also on the track is Karen Dotrice (Many Lives of Thomasina) who plays young Jane Banks and composer Robert Sherman (All the Disney Classics). They all seem to speak fondly of the shoot, the cast and crew and especially have some funny memories of the production itself.<br /><br />A MAGICAL REUNINION: There is a great walk down "memory lane" with Robert Sherman, Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews. They musically review through stories and example of the songs and how the evolution occurred. Dick van Dyke is amazing enthusiastically about his part as Bert. Julie discusses everything from the children to learning about making her very first film ever.<br /><br />THE MAKING OF MARRY POPPINS: Is an amazing visual and educational look at the making of the film. This is the longest of the extra features and goes in depth of the time, energies and efforts into making this Walt Disney classic. Filled with outtakes, behind the scenes footage and commentary from Julie and most of the cast, crew and musical influences of the film. It is hosted by - Dick Van Dyke (Bert) himself!<br /><br />Other features include Dick Van Dyke's original MAKE-UP test, THE GALA WORLD Premiere at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and one of my favorites the DECONSTRUCTION of two scene that include the break down of special effects and animation and their elements being combined.<br /><br />I LOVE TO LAUGH - A game for the kids who have watched the movie and handle some visual trivia from the film.<br /><br />THE CAT THAT LOOKED AT THE KING: Finally there is an extra bonus of a great little new animated short that is from one of the original P.L. Travers books. Julie Andrews herself takes you through the adventure in a very "Marry Poppins" sort of way. Guest voices include David Ogden Stiers (Beauty and the Beast, M.A.S.H., Pocahontas), Tracey Ullman (The Tracy Ullman Show, I Love You To Death, Once Upon A Mattress) and England's own Sarah Ferguson.<br /><br />The film directed by Robert Stevenson  (Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Love Bug, The Absent Minded Professor)  is an amazing piece of fun, entertainment and a true lesson in life and the love of family. Richard and Robert Sherman's score, music and songs will leave you singing long after the movie is over! This is an Amazing DVD with tons of extras for the family to enjoy. Sentimental moments, very funny moments and some very heartwarming emotions get this one before it disappears like Marry Poppins herself does! I loved it! (12/04)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent film, Great Performances"></head><body><p>Stylish, visually excellent, and a total  entertainment  treat, both aurally and visually.<br /><br />For a comprehensive experience, I would recommend reading the original tale by Washington Irving. The amazing thing about this re-telling of the story, is that although it is an original script, all of the threads of that great story are present in the film. Which is part of the reason, I feel, that this film works so very well.<br /><br />After watching the film, you get a definite feeling of a wide open space, but listen to the commentary, and find out just what the crew had to do to create the illusion that is there in the film. Depp is in great form , as his chameleon like  ability to change for roles is expressed, and he incorporates his version of Roddy McDowell ( in a sort of tribute I think), together with the Ichabod Crane character ( and Ichabod apparently means "The Glory is Gone"... so kind of interesting there). Depp hones that nit-picking, detail  orinted, and partially jittery character that seems to be expressed by Roddy, and uses it well in the films course.<br /><br />Surrounded by a cast which is brilliant as well as totally supportive, you can see the best of the best in this group; all the main support characters appear in films regularly, and the very avuncular Patriarch of the family whose daughter is Christina Ricci's  character, is joined by the Notary, the Doctor, The Priest, The Magistrate, and etc., as well as the pre-eminent Brom, and the mysterious second wife of the Patriarch.<br /><br />The film is well paced, from the start where the Elder of the Village is attacked, through the introduction of Depp's character, with the all too brief appearance of Christopher Lee, the cast draw out an amazing series of performances.<br /><br />The unravelling of the threads of deceit and conspiracy make for a well crafted  tale. And Christopher  Walken's role as the body and head of the Horseman is truly masterful.<br /><br />An Excellent  film.<br /><br />ENJOY.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Why????"></head><body><p>Positive two stars for selecting the Bollywood style colorful clothes and accoutrements and some of the music although they could have chosen more entertaining representations of  the '80s (probably didn't want to spend the money).<br /><br />Negative two stars for just copying a well worn "going back in time" storyline that made no sense (not a requirement), implementing it with another alcohol induced night of juvenile plot and dialogue writing in which, I lost count at around 200 uses of a f word or it's derivatives. At least the script writers did not have to exert themselves on a dictionary/thesaurus for dialogue longer than four letters.<br /><br />Viewers that were hot for "Hot Tub" will also have their rebellious inner self  fulfilled by "Youth in Revolt".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the original, but ..."></head><body><p>The movie had very good acting: Washington, Schreiber and Streep were all excellent. The plot was tight and suspenseful. The original was better, but this was a pretty good thriller on its own. The remake filled in some of the pot holes that were opened in the original and created some of its own. The original was more suspenseful and I cared more about the characters. However, Denzel's character very sympathetic.<br /><br />I am stuck because I don't want to reveal the changes in the plot. The original Manchurian candidate has the Cold War as its milieu. The remake has a nebulus corporate entity pulling the strings. It is just not as scary as the communist scare.<br /><br />It is a good movie and the acting is very good.</p></body></html>

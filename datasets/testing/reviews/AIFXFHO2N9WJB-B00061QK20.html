Here's what I mean, I didn't want to see "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", it just didn't appear to be that interesting to me, yet critics applauded the film for its intense action and drama, so like a brainwashed moron I watched the film, and go figure I hated it.  Apparently I didn't learn my lesson though, since I was convinced yet again by critics and by a couple of friends this time, to see the Quentin Tarentino produced, Jet Li epic "Hero".  This movie with subtitles or dubbed, either way has incredibly boring and wooden dialogue, and the action sequences, while awesome lack the realism that I was hoping for to some extent.  I'm ok with over-the-top action, that is unrealistic to an extent, but the action in this movie was just like that in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", impressive but unrealistic.  The difference between the action scenes in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Hero", is that in "Hero" the wirework used to create the action is quite obvious because some of the flying appears to be wobbly and clunky.  Well, that's enough complaints for now, let's get on with the story description for "Hero" and then I'll give a final breakdown to finish things off.<br /><br />"Hero" is a movie that apparently was made in China a few years before it's release here in the states, because when the movie was in theaters the Chinese import-DVD was at several retailers.  The story of "Hero" is set before China became one country, when the different regions of China were divided up into warring provinces.  The ruler of the Qin province has a plan to unite all of the warring provinces together to form one nation.  However, some of the other provinces do not want this to occur for fear of being oppressed under the ruler of Qin or anyone else that may not have their province's best interests in mind.  To thwart the unification from occurring, several highly paid and trained assassins are sent to eliminate the ruler of Qin, and anyone else who gets in their way.  After cutting down one soldier and/or bodyguard after another, the assassins are getting closer and closer to achieving their goal, that is until they encounter a local prefect (Jet Li) of one of the villages of Qin.  This prefect, though only one man, single handedly eliminated all of the assassins and now serves to protect the ruler of Qin at all costs.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, I knew I would probably not enjoy this movie too much, but I thought surely my friends would not lead me astray (I didn't have the same faith in the movie critics), sadly my faith was misplaced.  Though the movie had potential, in my mind, it quickly squandered it, leaving us with a story that defies belief (even more than "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), I mean one man taking on entire armies, give me a break.  The acting and dialogue seemed wooden, and truthfully the parts of the story that are purely drama are incredibly boring and really don't propel the movie forward at all, they are only there to fill space between overblown fight scenes.  The special effects and wirework were impressive in some scenes while others weren't as good.  "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" contained better special effects and wirework than this film.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie, unless you absolutely loved "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" or are a fan of Jet Li, then you might enjoy this film.  Otherwise I suggest avoiding this movie and seeing a much better Jet Li movie, "Unleashed".<br /><br />"Hero" is rated PG-13 for violence and minor sensuality.</p></body></html>

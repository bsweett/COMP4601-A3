Eliminating emotion is the accepted panacea for future wars. Each citizen is to take a dose of medication every day.  In addition, books, works of art, artistic embellishments, and music are all banned--a loudspeaker continually announces the latest "bans for E10 content." Their hope is to create a sterile utopia.  What they create instead is a totalitarian state run by the "Father" (Big Brother) of an order of Grammaton Clerics.<br /><br />John Preston (Christian Bale) is the chief of these clerics.  In the first scene, we see him verifying the authenticity of the Mona Lisa--and then firing it himself instead of allowing it to be taken in 'because some things manage to escape.'<br /><br />Preston is literally the 'cop's cop' and he's as straight arrow as they come.  When his partner, Partridge, begins to feel for the people of the Nethers, who are resisting being drugged and suppressing their emotions, Preston turns him in.<br /><br />Preston may well have eradicated the Resistance problem had it not been for an accidentally skipped dose of medication.  The next day, he saw the sun rise for the first time and began to unthaw himself.<br /><br />Preston begins to feel and consequently, his sympathies change.  He's thrust into a plot to overthrow the current government by killing the Father.<br /><br />Bluntly, I could pick this film apart--yes, few of the individual ideas are new.  However, the way the film's ideas are put together is very well done.  Battles are in my opinion, better than "Matrix" and martial arts fans really need to see the "gun katas."</p></body></html>

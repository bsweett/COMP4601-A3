<meta name="summary" content="A deeply provocative film"></head><body><p>It cannot be said enough, whether in film or books, that experimenting with certain aspects of Mother Nature can produce catastrophic problems with unconscionable consequences. So enter "Splice" into that select pantheon of stories that provoke life-altering, ethical consideration with a loud, clanging warning.<br /><br />I don't much care for Adrien Brody as an actor, didn't know Sarah Polley, but did recognize the Monster element from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1897093519">Frankenstein (Qualitas Classics)</a> and was thus hooked. In fact, it's the tailed creature shown in promos which drew me to the film in the first place. You know humans have the physical structure to have had a tail at one point. That tail develops into an interesting part of the creature's anatomy, plus its bird-like physiognomy and its amphibious lungs. Evolution compacted into one beautiful creature.<br /><br />Yet, every time, whether on the page or in celluloid, let someone experiment with the human element and see what you get. Every time. As one who had taught "Frankenstein" in high school English classes, I was pulled into viewing the film despite potential silliness often wrought in such films. Instead, I was absolutely mesmerized, so much so, that after the film ended--very open-ended, I might add--I watched again and picked up nuances I missed the first time.<br /><br />So, what was so mesmerizing? The idea of splicing human DNA with animal DNA? Enter Dr. Moreau and his entourage of misshapened critters. How about re-animating a creature with component human parts? Yes, Mary Shelley told us about those problems and the pathos of the creature who merely craves acceptance and love. Or Robin Cook's half-human, half-monkey in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425161242">Chromosome 6</a> with the brain to speak and think and feel, but physiognomy that required being locked out of sight. However, the Greeks warned us extensively about hubris--that pointedly selfish human element that permeates and poisons human history, both individually and collectively. All these problems merge and re-emerge in "Splice."<br /><br />Elsa, half of this couple, both in the lab and in the bedroom, and Clive, her partner, have produced blobs with the potential of using the DNA proteins of future genetic experiments (new creatures with human DNA) to correct human ills, like MS, cancer, and the like. The pharmaceutical company that underwrites their expenses encourages them to do so. However, the grossly effective scene in which Fred and Ginger (the DNA "monsters") horrifies their scientific audience by engaging, not in paramour, but in vicious, to-the-death battle, sets up the second half of the story. Although this scene, protested by some as unnecessary, is, indeed, required because it provides important foreshadowing in horrific plot development to come. Unequivocably.<br /><br />And so we have "Splice," not simply an entertainment, but a violent commentary on going beyond, eating that denied fruit of the untouchable tree--and, of course, it is the woman who violates all protocol to create something new. Once she breaks the rules--all sorts of rules: common sense, ethical, scientific, religious--there is no going back, no undoing. Oh, yes, excuse me. Clive does try to kill their creation. Yet, once this new species lives, he will, inevitably, step beyond another boundary and taste completely this new fruit. Consequences? Just as in the biblical story: No more garden, no more eternal life, then just problems, problems, and more problems.<br /><br />Remember <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXA0">Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)</a> and all the dialog that resulted for weeks and weeks afterward? "Splice" is definitely one of those films.<br /><br />(Note: Really surprising is how good the animation is. In fact, the creature early on looks so real that I kept looking for some clue as to technique, some little slip to show the creature was indeed not real. Nothing looks phony or tacky. The creature's realism lends serious credence to the plot and the film as a serious entity.)</p></body></html>

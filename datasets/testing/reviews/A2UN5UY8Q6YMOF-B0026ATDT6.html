<meta name="summary" content="One of the worst I've seen in a while"></head><body><p>I'd never heard of this movie so I thought I'd give it a rent.  Big mistake.  The movie is described as a thriller and a comedy, but there is nothing thrilling about it and the only funny thing is how bad the plot and acting are.  Within the first few minutes of the movie, we see the monster.  It looks like a giant tadpole.  There's no build up or suspense like in Jaws or Alien.  Then the troops come in much like a Godzilla vs Smog Monster movie.<br /><br />The rest of the time a family hunts the monster to recover a little girl.  The grandfather is the only decent character.  The brother and sister are mean, while the father of the girl is an annoying idiot.  Bad acting and plot aside, the movie is just plain boring.  I noticed 1 playback glitch on my Toshiba A1 with version 2.3 firmware.  It reminded me of a layer change on a regular DVD.  Otherwise playback was fine and picture quality was good.<br /><br />Next time I gripe about a Hollywood movie, I'll remember this turd and keep my mouth shut.  Don't waste your time on this one.</p></body></html>

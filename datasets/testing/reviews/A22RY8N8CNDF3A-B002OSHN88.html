The music throughout was "The Third Man Theme" with the zither's upbeat circus-like twang ringing oddly between the film's dark and shadowy black and white murder mystery.<br /><br />Unemployed pulp mystery novelist, Holly Martins (Joseph Cogtten) arrives in post-world-war II Vienna, hoping to live with a childhood friend Harry (Orson Wells).  Holly is "between books" and has little income, so he is grateful when his friend offers him room and board in Vienna, as well as a one-way airline ticket to get there.  When he arrives, Holly learns that his friend Harry has died in an accident.  He is in time for the burial and arrives at the graveyard confused and shocked at the events.  Compelled to investigate the death, Holly slowly uncovers startling revelations about Harry's life.<br /><br />The visuals alone make this film (DVD) worth owning.  The movie dragged a little in the beginning and Orson Wells does not appear until after about an hour of viewing.  Many questions arise during the first part that are chewed over with looks and glances, but no real "grab" to the viewer.  After Orson Wells appears there is more action and interest.<br /><br />There are a lot of dark corners, nighttime chases on cobblestone streets as well as beneath Vienna's rubble in sewer labyrinths.  The close-ups and angles give the film a touch of class as the mystery unfolds.</p></body></html>

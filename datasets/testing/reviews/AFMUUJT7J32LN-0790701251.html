<meta name="summary" content="Boot camp is fantastic. " This if for fun, this is your gun""></head><body><p>The boot camp is entertaining and absorbing. The plot starts too loose it way when hippie factor starts coming out. Poor little vietnamnese girl want boom boom. What is it with always the BOOM BOOM vietnamnese girls. Like platoon it starts well and then it goes back to melodrama. I feel like watching it half way through and then not watching the rest. More special effects could of helped it along. The moral of this story is the americans went to vietnamn for BOOM BOOM. All girls in vietnamn are sexy and americans all lust after them.</p></body></html>

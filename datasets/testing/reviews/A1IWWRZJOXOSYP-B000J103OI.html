<meta name="summary" content="A World of Perfectionists"></head><body><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is a funny fast-paced story about the world of high fashion.  Meryl Streeps' performance is riveting.  She has two Oscars (Best Supporting Actress for "Kramer vs. Kramer" 1979 & Best Actress for "Sophie's Choice" 1982).  "The Devil Wears Prada" was her 13th Oscar nomination.  For this film she won awards from the Golden Globes, London Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics, Satellite Awards and Women's Film Critics Circle.  Her performance is an amazingly controlled one.  We see her as the quintessential difficult boss with snide quips and impossible demands.  The scene that totally makes the film for me is the one where she sits in the hotel in Paris without makeup and tells Andy about her latest divorce.  Her disappointment is so real, muted and emotionally deep that it throws all of the rest of the character into perspective.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's performance is easy to overlook, even though it is the lead.  Her basic chore as Andy Sachs is to make us like her.  She accomplishes this.  She goes from the one they call "the fat girl" to a high fashion professional meeting all of the demands and repeatedly placing job over her personal life.  At the film's climax, she makes her decision & changes course.  She doesn't have any wild quirks like Streep's Miranda Priestly or Emily Blunt's Emily, but she makes the film accessible for the viewer.<br /><br />British actress Emily Blunt plays the first assistant Emily.  (Did they rename the character or was this a coincidence?)  She won the Best Supporting Actress award from the London Film Critics Circle and has translated this high profile role into five upcoming films!  ("The Snow Goose," "The Girl in the Park," "Wind Chill," "The Great Buck Howard" & "The Jane Austin Book Club.")  Her snide quips and cold exterior are hysterically superficial as she treats Andy with a "kick the dog" mentality.<br /><br />Standley Tucci does a good job as Nigel.  His cold wisdom is so picky and prickly that we love to hate him instantly.  Adrian Grenier who was in several films I saw ("Cecil B. Demented" & "Hart's War") plays her boyfriend Nate.  His wide-eyed, slightly ethnic good looks play well opposite Hathaway.  Australian Simon Baker plays the writer Christian Thompson who eventually beds Andy in Paris.  He oozes romantic charm.<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada" is about superficiality and artifice, which may make some think that the film isn't about anything significant.  But at its heart is the desire to get ahead and success at all costs.  It asks the cogent philosophical question, "Does the end justify the means?"  However, it also presents a world of perfectionists for whom excellence is the standard.  I found the film funny and moving, filled with excellent performances.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark, depressing, duplicitous and deadly tale of debauchery"></head><body><p>How do you like my alliteration? Two brothers, Hank (Ethan Hawke) and Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) sink to new lows trying to ripoff their own parents jewelry store (and fence "the goods") to pay off debts and start new lives; from their completely screw-up ones.<br /><br />The story was tedious but extremely tense and nerve-wracking once the plan unravelled and "went completely south," as Hawke's accomplice shoots his Mom (she in turn kills him during the robbery attempt). She's taken off life support soon after. Then, it's their Dad, Charles (Albert Finney), who's on a relentless hunt to find out who the accomplices were. It's a predictable and tragic ending for all families. Not a happy ending.</p></body></html>

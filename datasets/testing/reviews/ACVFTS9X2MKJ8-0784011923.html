<meta name="summary" content="This disc undermines what Blu-Ray is all about"></head><body><p>Sony must think we just want any movie on Blu-Ray, so we can say that we have the best quality available of any particular movie.  I really wish these companies that release Blu-Ray would stick to the REASONS WHY we would upgrade our movie collections from DVD to Blu-Ray.<br /><br />This release of "The Terminator" onto Blu-Ray is a waste of everybody's money if your intention is the same as mine as to get a High-Definition improvement of our favorite movies.  If it can not be made to look any better than the DVD, please don't release the Blu-Ray version of the same mediocre quality.  However, I know with today's quality enhancement skills being applied to many films, this movie could have been greatly improved for a pleasing High-Definition improved picture and sound.  We know it takes a pain-staking frame-by-frame articulate effort to improve video quality but it CAN be done.  It has been done by many movie companies already.  And only then, should our movies be converted to Blu-Ray so that it JUSTIFIES why we would want to buy the movie again.  Jeez, is that too unrealistic of an expectation?<br /><br />Here are some words of deception used as well as some vague statements to explain what you're getting with this Blu-Ray release of "The Terminator":<br /><br />On the front (bottom), it says: EXPERIENCE HIGH DEFINITION<br /><br />The deception here is that this statement DOES NOT apply to this Blu-Ray disc.<br /><br />And on the top of the back it says: BLU-RAY DISC TAKES YOU BEYOND HIGH DEFINITION<br /><br />Again, that statement is not supported by this movie's un-enhanced transfer to Blu-Ray.  Shame on you, Sony!<br /><br />Then, there is this rather vague disclaimer that I guess we should start to look for before we waste our money buying the Blu-Ray to replace our DVD:<br /><br />Near the top on the back it says:<br /><br />PURE (meaning unchanged and unaltered) PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY. TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE MASTER<br /><br />Well, there you have what best explains that NO EFFORT has been made to improve this movie for transfer to Blu-Ray.  You're going to get the same un-improved video transfer as that of your DVD, and this Blu-Ray disc gives you less extras than the DVD.  And why is that?  So that, some day soon, they may actually apply that pain-staking, frame-by-frame, articulate effort to improve the video quality, and then put in all those currently existing extras that your DVD already has, so that they can sell the Blu-Ray version of this movie AGAIN.  Why else, would they leave out all those already existing extras?  It's a pre-calculated rip-off! It's a recognized release pattern that we've seen for years, and they still do it.  I believe George Lucas is the master of this corrupted "bilk-the-consumer" re-release then re-sell, style of profiting.  Sell it at a bare minimum for quality and content.  Then, improve on it, and then sell it again.<br /><br />So, I hope this will be a lesson to us all.  And I've learned this with several Blu-Ray releases as well.  Just because it's been transferred to Blu-Ray, DOES NOT mean that it's going to look any better than your currently owned DVD.<br /><br />So, buyer beware!  If possible, RENT IT FIRST!  So, you can compare it to your DVD.  That would save you money in the long run, don't you think?</p></body></html>

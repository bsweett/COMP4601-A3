<meta name="summary" content="ANOTHER WASTED OPPORTUNITY"></head><body><p>Good concept. Good cast. Good scares. Good suspense. That being said, the good things about Wrong Turn are outweighed by the wasted opportunities to be unique.<p>Instead, Wrong Turn falls into the realm of typical, forgettable, predictable movies that are being mass produced these days. It doesn't take any chances, it doesn't do anything different and it doesn't leave a lasting impression.<p>The movie builds up into something that is gonna be cool, scary and unique, but eventually you realize that... nope... same old movie, different actors. Another movie that didn't have the guts to break the mold and thus is just ordinary.</p></body></html>

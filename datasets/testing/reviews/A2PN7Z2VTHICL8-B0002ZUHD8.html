<meta name="summary" content="Not standard Arthurian legend but still spectacular!"></head><body><p>Forget the Arthurian legends you have grown up with, just take them and put them aside, along with all your clean and proper kingly court ideas, and get ready for an epic medieval battle film that will leave you breathless from its stunningly flamboyant proportions.<br /><br />Following a myth of different origins, this tale of King Arthur tells of a Briton who serves the Roman Empire's army for 15 years, something that they were required to do while under Roman control for God and Country.  Arthur, or Artorius Castus, (played expertly by Clive Owen) and his six Knights have carved a name for themselves in the Roman armies, a legend of being an unbeaten force.<br /><br />At the end of their 15 years of service, they are summoned by Bishop Germanius (played by talented Ivano Marescotti) to receive their freedom from service.  But the Bishop tells them they are not to be freed until performing one last task for Rome, freeing a loyal Roman family from invasion by the Saxon's to the north, in particular, the son of the family, Alecto.<br /><br />Arthur and his six Knights, Gawain, Lancelot, Tristin, Galahad, Bors, and Dagonet set off for the north, grumbling at Rome's betrayal.  They must travel through the lands that the Woads occupy, strange barbaric foes led by a wise man named Merlin.  Once past the Woads, Arthur finds the Roman family taking the power of their God and Country and using it to create serfs and slaves, torturing those who they deem heretics.  One of the heretics Arthur frees from the prisons is Guinevere, a Woad.<br /><br />With the Roman family unwilling to go submissively with them, and Saxon drums beating on their heels, the seven Knights flee into the mountains in a desperate attempt to fulfill their last obligation to the empire and gain their freedom.<br /><br />Does this movie follow any Arthurian legend?  Not remotely.  Does this movie have any historical value?  None whatsoever.  Is this a good movie?  Yes, indeed!  Put down those history books and King Arthur fantasies and get ready for a stunningly filmed epic, a medieval battle movie far superior to any of the bad "Arthur" movies (except Excalibur).  This is a medieval fantasy, and a very grand one at that.  The photography is spectacular, the acting is superior to many of the "bigger names".  The dialogue is interesting, funny, and intriguing, capturing a closer bond to the feelings of the Knights of their time with the humped up society of today.<br /><br />These are not the shiny Knights of Boorman's `Excalibur', but a rough and dirty bunch, still keeping nobility about them and Honor above all else.  Special mention goes to Ray Winstone, who plays Bors, Joel Edgerton who plays Gawain, Ioan Gruffuddand who plays Lancelot, and Keira Knightly who plays Guinevere, along with Clive Owen, who I can see as the next Mel Gibson.  Owen fits the part to a Tee, and Knightly plays Guinevere the way she should have been played, both soft and tough.  Knightly was good in Pirates Of The Caribbean, but she is great as Guinevere.<br /><br />Still, the real attraction to this movie is the striking photography of the battles.  Take particular notice of the fight on the ice, the way the arrows fly through the air, and tip your hat to the costume designer for some spectacular outfits and gear that truly bring this epic to life.  This movie is pure eye candy for those who love a good medieval fight, tossed with realistic characters and a touch of romance.<br /><br />My only negative thought would be that it needed a little more blood, but since King Arthur was headed towards the PG-13 crowd like LOTR, some decapitation scenes didn't occur that I thought may have enhanced the battles.  All in all, a very lovely piece of tasty filmmaking that should not be ignored simply because it didn't follow someone else's rules.  Enjoy!!</p></body></html>

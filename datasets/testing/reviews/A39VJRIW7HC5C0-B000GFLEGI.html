A lot of interesting ideas are put onto the screen, but ultimately the movie doesn't end up being terribly memorable.  By no means is this a poor film, but it lacks dynamic and has more in common with the Dawn of the Dead remake than any of the original Romero films.  The characterization, so integral to the enjoyability of Night, Dawn, and Day, has been to some degree short-changed.  Dennis Hopper's tyrant is enjoyable enough, Asia Argento is tough enough, and Jason Riley is stolid enough, but the audience never really gets in under the proverbial skin of their characters.  Again, mediocre but not exceptional.  One could argue that humans are not the point of Romero's movies, zombies are, but that wouldn't be quite true: all the "dead" movies are about how the humans react to the rising of the dead, and characterization is essential.  The undead are quite good, and I liked how they united under the leadership of one exceptional zombie to invade the human compound.  The organization of the city was good, the class conflict handled reasonably well, the acting competant and the special effects/makeup superlative.  However, the lack of characterization coupled with a subpar ending (although in fairness "Day's" ending wasn't spectacular either) make this a two and a half star effort in opposed to a three.  **1/2</p></body></html>

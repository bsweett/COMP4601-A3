I thought the film was entertaining but I certainly don't think it deserves all the hoopla that's been going around. Visually, it didn't offer anything that was new. The plot was very different from the first but what I liked about the first one was the character development.....getting to know who these people are. In Spider 2, it seemed that there were so many maudlin moments that were unnecessary. Constantly telling the audience that things are bad. Alrgiht. I got the point. Move on. I thought the acting was very forced also. Too many tears for a comic book character. In fact, every character had some tears to shed at various points, even the bad guys, the supporting actors and the EXTRAS!!! C'mon. This is NOT heavy drama and could NEVER be construed as such so why throw it in so many times?</p></body></html>

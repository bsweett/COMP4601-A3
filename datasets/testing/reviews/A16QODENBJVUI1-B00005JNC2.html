<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies I've seen on DVD in quite a while"></head><body><p>I had intended to see GARDEN STATE when it was in the theaters, but for some reason I never got around to it.  Then when it came out on DVD, I kept intending to see it, but for whatever reason didn't, until now.  As they say, better late than never, and I'll add that this ends a personal losing streak of seeing one disappointing movie after another<br /><br />The movie is basically about a struggling actor in Hollywood who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral.  Like so many movies involving a trip home, this one becomes a journey of self-discovery and renewal, as Andrew Largeman confronts the shape life has taken since the moment he caused a serious accident his mother suffered when he was nine.  Heavily medicated for most of his life, he resolves to get off the host of drugs he is on.  Meanwhile, just as he is determined to get off anti-depressants so that he can feel again, he meets a charming yet quirky girl who has her own set of problems.  For whatever reason, they click and embark on their own romance.<br /><br />Plot in a movie is not the same as execution, but luckily the film is executed marvelously, maintaining a perfect balance between funny but quirky weirdness and emotional authenticity.  The film is full of laughs, but it is much more than just a collection of laughs.  All in all, it is a very impressive movie.<br /><br />You have to love what Zach Braff did in this film.  Few have pulled off the triple feat of acting, writing, and directing as well as he did here.  What is remarkable is how well he managed all three.  As an actor, he is a performer of immense likeability.  I think if he manages to stay within the range of that fundamental likeability as an actor, he is going to have a remarkable career.  The general feeling is that next year will be the last for SCRUBS, which while a great vehicle for Braff is probably keeping him from the movie career that beckons.  I hope that at some point he returns as well to both writing and directing.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is enjoyable in her role as Sam, the epileptic girl he meets and falls in love with.  She is an actress.  I mean by that that she performs roles, she doesn't just play herself in films.  This isn't one of her most impressive performances to date, but it is further evidence of her considerable talent.  Unfortunately, much of her time was eaten up in recent years by the lamentable STAR WARS trilogy.  I'm very anxious to see what she does from here on out.  Her character gave me a bit of a pang because of the way it reminded me of a major ex-girlfriend of mine, who like Sam was a compulsive liar (as with Sam, she would lie on all manner of incredibly small--as well as big--things) and who also like same carried about the tattered remnants of her "blankey."  A definite moment of deja vu for me.<br /><br />GARDEN STATE contains one of the most celebrated soundtracks of recent years and it isn't an accident that it has enjoyed considerable success on its own.  In addition to all else that he did on the film, Braff picked out all the songs on the record.  It is a very well chosen selection.  I've often wondered how much of a role, if any, he plays in the music selection of music on SCBUBS, which has some of the best music of any show on TV.<br /><br />All in all, this is a superb movie.  If you like intelligent, serious yet eccentric comedy, you will almost certainly enjoy this one.</p></body></html>

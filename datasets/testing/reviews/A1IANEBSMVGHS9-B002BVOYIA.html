<meta name="summary" content="So easy to overlook... still so powerful"></head><body><p>It is so ironic how, in a world of omni-connectivity and 24/7 news,  perhaps as a result of an overabundance of "information", events as horrific as the Rwandan conflict could be overlooked as blatantly. This movie portrays the manager of a hotel in the capital of Rwanda (played impeccably by Oscar nominee Don Cheadle) as he harbors over 1,200 refugee Tutsis and moderate Hutus who were fleeing from the horror of a certain death by machete in the hands of the Hutu extremists.<br /><br />It is simply impossible not to be touched by the movie and be on edge all through it, when you realize how much cruelty there can be in this world, potentially leading to the killing of as many as 1 million people because they are different in some way, or happen to have a certain label stamped on their passport... The movie does not focus as much on the killing of the people, but rather on the heroic acts of the hotel manager (Paul Rusesabagina). Still there are numerous moments of violence presented in the it.<br /><br />You just have to see this movie. Not doing so would be equivalent to looking away, the same way that most countries (the U.N. included) did during the Rwandan Genocide.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I actually liked it"></head><body><p>I'm surprised that I liked this film.  I did have to replay the ending to make sure that the DVD hadn't skipped or something.  When I sat back to think about the point the film was making, I believe I understood its point.  Every generation once it reaches a certain age thinks things are getting worse.  The whole 'back in my day' soliloquies we give, but the truth is elusive sometimes.  The wickedness of mankind has always been violent.  We are the ones that change.  Our tolerance, our view of the world and what we think our place is in it.  Everyday there is some story in the news that makes absolutely no sense, but in our films we want the motivation spelled out to us.  In this piece I think the Coen brothers and McCarthy does a good job in portraying "senseless" violence.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

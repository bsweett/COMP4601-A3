<meta name="summary" content="great movie from a great director and actors"></head><body><p>this is another wonderful movie done by the greatest david lean. i just wish that now and in the near future, new directors like him with big heart would appear again. by watching this movie without computerized special effects manipulation, the realistic feeling was far too superior to all the movies that flooded in theaters and on dvds nowadays. by comparison, what clint eastwood did and is doing now are little bit closer to what david lean did before, but still lagged behind about mile long. david lean is one of the rare directors who could transform good screenplays and made them so vividly alive and presented to us with the most wonderful cinematography. he's one of the pillars of our human civilization.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Updated for review of the 2012 "Mind-Bending Edition""></head><body><p>A clever Arnie science fiction thriller "Total Recall" maintains the over-the-top vibe of Paul Verhoven's ("Robocop", "Basic Instinct", "Starship Troopers", "Showgirls")other American films; the films feature an absurd almost pornographic level of violence, tongue-in-cheek humor and a clever plot twist.<br /><br />The story for the five people who haven't seen it is based on Phil Dick's (Dick wrote the novels that were adapted into the films "Blade Runner", "A Scanner Darkly" and has had numerous stories turned into films)story "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale", features Arnie as construction worker Doug Quaid who feels like something is missing in his life. Against his wife's (Sharon Stone) advice Quaid goes to REKALL a company that specalizes in memory implant vacations. Quaid elects the Martian vacation package where he'll be an undercover operative helping to liberate the Mars colony. There's one hitch--it turns out that Quaid MAY very well be the character he was going to pretend to be on vacation and that REKALL's attempt to implant the memory uncovers a suppressed one.<br /><br />Ronny Cox gives a deliciously over-the-top performance as the bad guy here that rivals his slimy, evil performance in "Robocop". Sharon Stone isn't hard on the eyes here and Arnie gives a solid performance as Quaid (although I can imagine a VERY different film if the original star attached at one point--Richard Drefyus--had been cast and someone a bit more subtle had directed). "Total Recall" is a fun, loud, violent flick typical of what you'd expect from Arnie and from the 1990's but this version, well, it looks pretty awful.<br /><br />Update for 2012 Edition:<br /><br />The "Mind-Bending Edition" is a marked improvement over the original subpart Blu-ray release. The image quality improves with a sharper, more detailed picture. Having said that, the effects sequence have a softer quality to them which is not atypical for a film from the 80's using pre-CGI visual effects. The color is also improved here but I seem to remember the film having bolder colors in theaters although I should note that it's been a long, long time since I saw this in theaters and that memory may be "colored" by seeing it on television with boosted color values that weren't part of the original presentation.<br /><br />This edition features an often amusing commentary track (Arnie's habit of describing the action isn't as annoying as it might appear to be at first listen--it actually is quite amusing to hear him describe the action at times on the screen)while director Verhoeven's commentary track is pretty good although far less animated than, say, "Starship Troopers" or "Showgirls".<br /><br />We get a "making of" featurette as well as a restoration comparison, stills gallery and the original trailer. Compared to the previous edition, this version is positively filled to the brim with special features. We also get featurettes on the various effects in the film while the only one missing that I can think of is on the production history of the film (this is one of two projects that the late Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett were working on at the same time--the other one was "Alien").<br /><br />I'd recommend this new edition (the review for the previous version is below).<br /><br />PREVIOUS EDITION (2006):<br /><br />I'm saddened to report that this is one of the worst Blu-ray transfers I've ever seen; Lion's Gate's version looks like it was upscaled from a standard DVD or pulled from the same regular definition source. The film looks soft with fine detail often lost in the murky looking Blu-ray disc.<br /><br />I'd recommend skipping this edition which even for $9 (amazon's price when I wrote this review) isn't worth it. It's ugly looking. Wait until Lion's Gate elects to upgrade this with a better looking transfer from a better source or go for the UK edition which looks better than this pathetic excuse for a Blu-ray. Skip it.</p></body></html>

If there was an academy award for &quot;most enjoyable movie of the year&quot; this would win hands down. Brandan  was perfectly cast as the gung-ho hero and rachel was great as the  beautiful love interest. (and beautiful she is) just like his less  sucessful but(in my books) equally enjoyable &quot;Deep Rising&quot;,  Steven Sommers trades horror in for fun thrills. The Mummy is a perfect  action movie and the DVD version shows you can improve on perfection.</p></body></html>

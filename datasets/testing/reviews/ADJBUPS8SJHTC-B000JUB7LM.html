<meta name="summary" content="A powerful story with a powerful punch"></head><body><p>I can see why this picture was named Best Picture and Hillary Swank won the award as well as Morgan Freeman for their performances. Swank plays this waitress from trailer park Missouri who comes to California to pursue her dreams. She eats off folks leavings at work and saves up just about every dime and works hard because as Morgan Freeman so beautifully narrated in the film, there is a dream in everyone that only they can see and for her it's a shot at becoming a female boxer; She don't have many people in her corner rooting for her; Matter of fact, her family down her and even spurns the house she buys in cash money for them because as the mother puts it, "she don't wanna mess up her welfare" that just reinforces to me that that mentality isn't in any one group of folk. Anyhow, in spite of the odds(she's over 30, little or no support, one woman in a male dominated field,the lack of respect female boxers get, the reluctance of Eastwood to even want to train her ("I Don't Train Girls") she makes a name for herself and rise up in the ranks in spite of the fact that other fighters are reluctant to spar with her due to her knocking them out in the first round.And even when things get better, she stays grounded and keeps on training. One of the saddest yet triumphant scenes in the movie is when her family comes to see her in the hospital, going to Disneyland on her dime mind you(Remember they felt she was a laughing stock) and wanted her to sign some papers basically giving them complete control over her affairs and with the lawyer in hand, mind you but she kicks them to the curb and sends their butts packing. But in spite of the good, there's some bad and sad; Won't spoil it all. One more thing, I think Morgan Freeman's role in the movie as narrator and as the voice of reason to Clint Eastwood's character was refreshing and candid; I liked and applauded it; Eastwood gave a great performance as well. I tell you what though, that priest needed telling off. If a person is trying to find God no matter how old or what have you, it is your job to help them to him. How you gonna sit and pass judgment over a man who wanted answers? didn't like that at all. Otherwise, a great movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It is what is not being said...wonderful film!"></head><body><p>Hours is about the profound affect that Virginia Woolf's book 'Mrs. Dalloway' has on herself, a reader, and someone who knows the reader.  This is depicted through three different periods over an 80 year stretch.  The first period takes place when Virginia (Nicole Kidman) is writing the book while going through a tough time in her life.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) represents the second period.  She is the reader of the book who can identify with the main character in the book.  The present time, and the third period, is embodied through Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) who has received the nickname Mrs. Dalloway from someone who has read the book.  The cast of Hours enhances it's monumental film experience by using deep rooted dialogues tangled with periods of silence.</p></body></html>

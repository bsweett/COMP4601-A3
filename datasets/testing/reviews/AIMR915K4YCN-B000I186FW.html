I don't care about the overt politics of the Wachowski brothers, I just love their movie! Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are the oddball, dream-pair of revolutionaries Evey and V, w/ a neo-fascist regime to clobber. Said regime is lead by a Big Brother-ish figure (John Hurt) who uses all media outlets as tools for mass distribution of propoganda (aka: news) in order to control, contain, and deceive the populous. If that's not enough, he also has his military, as well as his gestapo-like secret police force. Unfortunately for him, he has totally mis-judged and severely underestimated the human spirit and its hunger for freedom. V exploits / utilizes this catostrophic oversight to bring his master plan into being. Does V use violent means? Yes. Does he have a personal score to settle? Definitely. However, V's targets are each responsible for thousands of torturous deaths, and would certainly cause thousands more. V's vendetta will knock these deadly, dictatorial idiots out of the way, so that the people can take back their country and their government. Wonderful stuff! Highest recommendation...</p></body></html>

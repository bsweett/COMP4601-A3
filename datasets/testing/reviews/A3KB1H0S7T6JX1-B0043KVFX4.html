<meta name="summary" content="Mad Max meets Waterworld in a desert Zombieland"></head><body><p>Picking up from where Resident Evil Apocalypse left off, Extinction sheds light on events following the spread of the T-Virus aboveground, in and around Raccoon City.<br />The virus has now spread all over the world rapidly killing all life on the planet while below ground the Umbrella corporation is carrying out experiments on Alice's clones in order to provide the zombies with intelligence and turn them into a work/labor force. Alice on the other hand begs to differ...<br />Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well!<br />The plot, the setting, the special effects, and the battles are all very good. Moreover, the film does a great job of establishing a cliffhanger for a sequel.<br />In short, it is a movie worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment as long as you are in the mood for that kind of a film.</p></body></html>

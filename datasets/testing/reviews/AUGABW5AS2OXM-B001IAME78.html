<meta name="summary" content="Another Marvel Masterpiece!"></head><body><p>This is another fantastic movie made about a Marvel superhero. The Hulk<br />was one of my favorite characters when I was a kid. I am now 56. The<br />lead character is played by Edward Norton in the role of Bruce Banner.<br />He is exposed to gamma radiation which in turn creates the Hulk when he is angered. He is pursued by General Ross who wants to create a super soldier in the mold of the Hulk. His daughter is the love of Banner's life. Banner escapes from South America and returns to America to see Betty Ross. He is again pursued by General Ross. There is nonstop action<br />of the Hulk doing battle with the Army soldiers. General Ross has a major<br />played by Emil Blonsky. The major wants to be a monster like the Hulk. He<br />is finally able to do this. He is horrible and mean. He and the Hulk have<br />a battle to the death. It is quite a contest. The special effects in this movie are unbelievable. Be sure to see this movie. You will not be dissapointed.</p></body></html>

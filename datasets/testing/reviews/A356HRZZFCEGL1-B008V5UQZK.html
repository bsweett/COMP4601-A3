<meta name="summary" content="My Big Fat Greek Wedding Laughs :D :D :D"></head><body><p>My name is John Panagopoulos.<br /><br />Yes, my last name is Greek and I am Greek, Greek Orthodox to be exact.<br /><br />Yeah, my name is long (many Greek surnames are quite longer), but not that hard to pronounce.<br /><br />Parse it into syllables and say it slowly....<br /><br />Pa - na - gop (hard g, like "gus")- ou - los.<br /><br />Now that wasn't so difficult was it?<br /><br />Like many other ethnic groups, Greeks have endured their slings and brickbats of outrageous prejudice, stereotyping, and even general indifference. I believe many consider Greeks the evolutionary equivalent of paramecia. But I am not here to bewail Greek ethnic suffering, but to praise "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", a movie I took my fairly conservative but reasonable Greek parents to see. I honestly confess I laughed uproariously and continually throughout the movie. To non-Greeks, Toula's Greek universe may seem cartoonish, surreal, and even outrageously "sitcommy". Perhaps, but the exaggeration is only slight. I assure you the Greek beliefs, mannerisms, characteristics, and ideosyncrasies the game cast manifests on the screen do exist indeed. Tia Vardalos manages to satirize, lampoon, and skewer a vast variety of Greek life elements. Yet, she is not vicious, mean-spirited, or self-loathing. For all the guffaws, frenetic pacing, and boisterous interaction of the huge cast, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" graciously and generously reveals the sweet heart and humanity of her extended exasperating family. As the clich&eacute; goes, I laughed a lot with recognition and cried a little with recognition.<br /><br />It is pointless to rehash the admittedly derivative plot: it's a pastiche (this is the Greek word for "casserole" by the way, as Toulas irascible father would say) of "Romeo and Juliet", "Father of the Bride", "Only the Lonely" and every "ugly duckling", "coming of age", "class warfare" and "crazy ethnic" movie you can conceive. But who cares? The movie is achingly funny, people, for both Greeks and non-Greeks. I would recommend all families - ESPECIALLY Greek families- to see this hilarious farce. They will be pleasantly shocked by how true to Greek life it gets. "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" serves as a concise but comprehensive primer to Greeks in general. If you're not careful, you may learn something about us kooky, overlooked Greeks.<br /><br />Not once was I bored with this delightful movie. No one is an irredeemable villain in this movie, not even the obvious target of the chauvinistic patriarch, who only really wants his family to be happy. Everybody is flawed, but everybody also has their worth. Each actor/actress in the film was an unfettered joy to behold, and contributes admirably to the overall effect of a wonderful slice of precious ethnicity.<br /><br />Apart from two anatomy jokes a couple of Greek cousins trick Ian Miller, Toula's beau, into uttering in Greek, the movie is not profane, depraved, or crude. This is a family movie in every sense of the world.  It's safe to bring the kids.<br /><br />My commentary could easily extend into a surgical dissertation of every joke, character, plot device, and theme this celluloid cornucopia abundantly provides. But I will conclude with a paraphrasing of the theme the Greek patriach (Michael Constantine - a real Greek) hilariously and touchingly enunciates: The world is more than a melting pot. It is a fruit basket where apples (Millers) and oranges (Portokaloses) must and can happily live together with warmth, mutual respect, and happiness.<br /><br />Yes, I bought the DVD.<br /><br />P.S.: I almost forgot; my parents loved the movie too, though they were still a bit disappointed about Greeks marrying "xeni (non-Greek stranger)", though they admit that it is all but inevitable. In fact, my mom thought the "xenos" elements was even a bit dated; more and more, Greeks are marrying non-Greeks.</p></body></html>

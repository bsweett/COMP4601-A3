<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film Of The Year!  A Masterpiece!"></head><body><p>There will most likely never be a better film made about the subject of Hitler.  This film is incredibly well done.  The cinematography is unbelievable, the acting is amazing by the entire cast especially Bruno Ganz and the actresses playing Eva Braun and his secretary (using the clips from Blind Spot was a masterstroke).  The score was also quite good and the writing was superb throughout.  I found the film gripping from start to finish and I would definitely watch it again.  The element of it that I believe I most appreciated was its uncompromising portrayal of the people surrounding Hitler as the time just before his death(suicide)in the bunker.  This movie really makes you feel like you're there...You feel their sense of dread and loss.  Its a film that leaves you with many conflicting emotions.  One of the most haunting lines in the film is one that Hitler himself has where he basically implies in no uncertain terms that it isn't so much his fault that things happened as they did as it was the German people for going along with it and allowing it to happen.  He basically says the German people cut their own throats.  Listening to Hitler saying something like that is some powerful and riveting stuff...Its an honest, gutsy albeit controversial approach/statement that sets the film apart from many other films of its type.  There is no sugar coating here or beating around the bush and its particularly admirable in that this was entirely a german production.  You could almost think of it as if germans from the time like Hitler's secretary said you know what we screwed up big time and we better accept responsibilty for our actions and never forget what we did to so many innocent Jews and the stain we've left on our country's history.  Its not in any way that you feel sympathy for Hitler as some reviewers have suggested as it is you get an idea of what psychologically was going through people's heads during that time...And it can be quite a disturbing and despicable experience watching these people love and honor their Fuhrer so much.  But without a doubt it is a brilliantly directed thought provoking motion picture and one with core themes that we should never forget and that we are unfortunately dealing with today in this county (The U.S.) I am saddened to say.  But I'll refrain from going there...Just see the movie.  Also...It would make an effective double feature with Werner Herzog's film Invincible.  Some other films I'd highly recommend that deals with the same time period are Fasbsinder's BRD Trilogy (all three of the films in this Criterion collection are nothing but pure filmmaking genius), Verhoeven's Soldier Of Orange (a stunning film), Das Boot by Wolfgang Peteresen, All Quiet On The Western Front and a personal favorite of mine The Young Lions.</p></body></html>

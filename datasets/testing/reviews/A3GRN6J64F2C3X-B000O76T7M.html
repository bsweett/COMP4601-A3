Jason", but watchable"></head><body><p>My first instinct is to report that this movie really isn't all that good, but when you think about it, how wonderful and subtle and artful could a movie called "Alien Vs. Predator" actually be?  So, I'll be charitable and say that some of the scenarios are interesting (like the continually shifting walls in the pyramid where most of the story takes place) and many of the battles between the two alien species are cleverly staged and fairly fun to watch.  Also, the DVD offers a slightly extended cut of the film in addition to the version offered in theaters, as well as some commentaries, so you get a good bit more than just a movie for your rental dollar or purchase price.  Still, I wouldn't choose watching this film over actually going out and doing something.  But, if it's raining outside and you'd be sitting home anyway, give it a whirl.  It's a respectable time-passer.</p></body></html>

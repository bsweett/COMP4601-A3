<meta name="summary" content="Very cool"></head><body><p>I like occult movies generally and I like Keanu Reeves as an actor: both of which are things that my put me in the minority. Either way, I really liked this movie. I'm not familiar with the comic book it's based on but I thought the plot was very cool. The portrayals of Hell were interesting.

<meta name="summary" content="A murder mystery that's not afraid to be funny"></head><body><p>Harry Lockhart is a petty thief who has a turn of good luck when he's running from the police and enters an audition for a movie.  The cops don't find him and he's shipped to LA to screen test for a role.  Along the way he encounters Gay Perry, a consultant who is supposed to help Harry get into character for his role as a private investigator.  In preparation for the role, they unwittingly become involved in a real LA murder mystery involving Harmony, a struggling actress from Harry's past.<br /><br />This film was very funny and wasn't afraid to make fun of itself by using stereotypical Hollywood cliches.  In fact, one of the funnier things about it was the storyline revolving around how fake and ridiculous life in Hollywood is.  Good examples: A woman who comes up to Harry and says, "I do a little acting" is then shown to be the type of actress in late night Cinemax movies, or when a catty girl says Harry is checking him out he notes that they must have taken America by the East coast and shaken it, only the normal girls stayed and the others rolled down to LA.<br /><br />Overall this movie was funny and full of self-deprecating humor.  Val Kilmer's role as Perry was the highlight for me, as he was understatedly amusing in his supporting part.  The murder mystery takes a backseat to the comedy in this worthwhile film and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</p></body></html>

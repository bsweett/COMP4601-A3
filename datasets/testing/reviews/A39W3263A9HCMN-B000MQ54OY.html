<meta name="summary" content="March Of The Singing and Dancing Penguins"></head><body><p>I saw this movie yesterday. I went with a couple friends and we both loved it! Despite a noisy crowd form the little kids, it was a good movie.<br /><br />STORY: Every penguin in the Antarctica can sing... all except Mumble, who was born the worst singer in the world. However, he does have happy, tapdancing feet. He meets 5 amigos, and together, they try to find a voice. But then... He discovers that the fish are being taken away, so he embarks on a journey to get Fish.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: An amazing film! GREAT animation, and there's a HUGE jump scene.<br /><br />So go see this!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Plot Holes You Could Fly Marine One Through"></head><body><p>""The Sentinel" plays like a 108 minute episode of "Hawaii 5-0," minus the exotic locale (unless Toronto counts). It's fitting, because writer George Nolfi is also penning the upcoming "5-0" remake, but `70s cop shows are hardly the template one wants to use for compelling suspense. The slick production and decent direction (by "Homicide's" Clark Johnson) are sabotaged by plot holes you could fly Marine One through. When Garrison rabbits, for example." Pete Haar<br /><br />The plot lines of this movie were easy enough to follow. A disgraced Secret Service Man, Michael Douglas as Pete Garrison, tries to find the people who are blackmailing him. You see he is having an affair with the First Lady. The same First Lady he is hired to protect. Several secret Servicemen are killed and it is up to Kiefer Sutherland, as David Breckinridge, to find the source of the killings, and to investigate Garrison.  Alot of action filled sequences bring us to the Maryland shore where the one person who knows what is going on is mysteriously killed. Eva Longoria as a new Secret Service person is assigned to assist. She would play the love interest, except it seems, the movie's plot line has her being looked at as the 'sex object'. Could it be the low cut fitted pant suits she wears? In the end all is saved and everyone seems happy enough- though the dead kill seems to be mounting. The President is kept out of the action and appears to be clueless. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Adequate acting and a fast paced film keep this movie from sinking. A good movie for a long winter's night.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 2-14-07</p></body></html>

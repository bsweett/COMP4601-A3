The story is essentially about a plucky little girl, whose belief in herself and inner spirit makes members of her family realize things about life and what's ultimately important.  The acting is top notch in this, with Arkin winning an Academy Award for his great preformance, but it's the little girl that steals the show with her eyes that convey so much in their innocent gaze.</p></body></html>

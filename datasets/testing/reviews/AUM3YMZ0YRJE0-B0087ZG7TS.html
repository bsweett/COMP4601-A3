<meta name="summary" content="I recently bought this and completely forget that I had watched it already"></head><body><p>...I was just about to pop it in the DVD player when I looked at it and realized that I had already seen it a few weeks before but had completely forgotten it.  Perhaps I am getting old, but this rarely happens to me with the films I like - I can usually remember almost all the details of films that I liked, for years.  That wa a clear sign to me - as I fought to recall the details - that this was a rather unmemorable film, to say the least.<br /><br />It is one of those story-within-a-story mixtures of fact and fiction (entirely fiction, of course), when things are not quite what they seem.  You have an extraordinary youth who regrets a momentary action that impacted many lives, in a sense an original sin that has shaped decisively her life, let alone that of the people she impacted.  There are many beautiful things about the film, but it did not become the kind of interior journey that makes certain films kind of archetypal symbols that enter my imagination.  This one clearly did not.<br /><br />REcommended.  The acting is pretty good, the story is OK, and the production lush.  It just isn't great, in my view.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="E.T. the Extra Terrestrial: A Masterpiece Revisited"></head><body><p>I was a boy of 7 the first time I saw E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and I remember being so completely engrossed in the story and so completely moved by the tender relationship between E.T. and his human friend, Elliot, that I longed to see the film again.  Little did I know that it would be over 10 years before the film would be released for sale in any form.<p>As an adult, I had the privilege of taking my son to see this same film in the theaters.  The new release, which featured scenes that had been filmed but never seen, was as much a treat for me as it was for him.  I found that E.T. had lost none of its innocence, none of its poignancy, and none of its beauty in the 20 years it had been out of the theaters.  In fact, it brought with its anniversary a new found wonder-that a generation that had changed so much in 20 years could and would still embrace a film that focused on love, innocence and friendship as its common themes.<p>I was also thrilled when Stephen Spielberg released his classic film on DVD later that same year.  <p>This collection is great.  It features the film in its original format, and in its 20th anniversary reworking, with new effects and scenes added to enhance the classic that the world knew and loved.  While some critics have argued that the changes and additions detract from the movie, I think that they are fun, and add an element of joy to moviegoers who were already familiar with the film.  For those that had never seen it before, the new scenes do nothing to detract from the film, or alter the storyline, and so their addition should be of no consequence at all.<p>For those of you who aren't familiar with E.T. (is there anyone out there who isn't?), it is the story of an alien who is left behind on Earth, after his spaceship is discovered by the U.S. government and departs before he makes his return to the craft.  It is the story of a boy who befriends this alien and learns that love has no earthly bounds.  It is the story of children, who unite to help save the little alien, E.T., from his would-be government captors and return him to his own people.  <p>The movie features state-of-the-art effects from its era, and the newly released special edition also features cutting edge effects from today, enhancing the film where limitations of technology left some scenes looking less than realistic.  With a soundtrack that has been enhanced by Academy Award Winning Composer John Williams (who wrote the original score in 1982), this film has a fresh look that makes it look as current as any film shot today.<p>The DVD collection does contain extras, including an hour-long reunion video that was shot for the re-release of E.T. in 2002.  The video features the original cast, reunited for the first time since the movie made its debut in 1982.  The interviews offer insights into the making of the film along with the dynamic relationships the cast and crew had with each other.  <p>This is a great movie for the whole family.  It is one of those rare films that audiences of all ages will enjoy.  It is truly a piece of cinema magic, with a heartfelt story at its core. <p>-Scott Kolecki</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a real letdown but worth one go through"></head><body><p>this is directed by rob zombie.youd think with that really cool scene he did in beavus and butthead that this one would have turned out better.its long and drawn out in spots.its obviously not for the children.its also quite low budget.any real hardcore rob zombie fan will love it all the same.it gets gross a few times.its just a regular old horror film with vague wierd people and stupid teens getting themselves chadsed down and hacked up.it got a nc-17 rating so i was very exited to see it,but with that kind of build up,i was disapointed.</p></body></html>

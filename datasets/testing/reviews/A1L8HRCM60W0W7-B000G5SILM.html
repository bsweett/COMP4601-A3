<meta name="summary" content="IMPLAUSIBLE BUT DECENT POPCORN THRILLER"></head><body><p>Tough to go wrong with a Douglas/Sutherland vehicle. Often wooden and always smart-alecky, it is also as unabashed as Hollywood potboilers come. The life of the US president is in peril. I know, yawn. To his rescue comes a team of two super stars -- one suspect, the other circumspect. As you would imagine, they do not get along. A very coppish cat and mouse charade ensues. Which has a luscious Eva Longoria tittering about (no pun intended), never quite managing to deserve any meaningful presence other than a half-second where you think she just may be the snitch. Kim Basinger is tragically frittered, to understate it by a couple thousand notches. Thinking back, it is a heap of improbabilities, and the very crux of the film goes unexplained -- why was the plot against the pres hatched to begin with? But there's an upside; while one is at it, the script is taut enough to just about engulf an unsuspecting viewer. Worthy rental for sure, ignore the hordes of reviews that have slammed it for no obvious reason other than it's not 24. That, it needn't have been.</p></body></html>

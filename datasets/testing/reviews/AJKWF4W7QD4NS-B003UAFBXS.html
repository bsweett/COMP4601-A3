The story reveals that Elvis didn't die, and instead lives at a rest home in Texas with JFK (Ossie Davis) whose body was died black and brain transplanted in a matter of national security.  The resthome however is soon terrorized by an ancient mummy with a penchant for cowboy boots who is sucking the souls from the elderly residents; and it's up to the King and JFK to stop him.  Purposely ludicrous, but at the same time sincere, Bubba Ho-Tep is pure laugh out loud hilarity from beginning to end.  Campbell is perfect as Elvis, giving what maybe the best performance of his career.  His imitations, karate, and voice of Elvis are nearly perfect.  The makeup and effects aren't bad either for a low budget movie, and the whole cast and crew seems to be having a blast doing this.  Bubba Ho-Tep's only flaw is in it's pacing and final showdown which could have been better, but all together this is definitely worth seeing.  The DVD features are plentiful for a single disc DVD release, with an intriguing making of and two commentary tracks; one of which is Campbell as &quot;the King&quot; which is absolutely hilarious.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition)"></head><body><p>The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition) is a great adventure movie that is a bit like the Indiana Jones movies but with a mummy. Acting and plot are ok but one sees this movie for the action scenes and the special effects. The music is quite good also. This movie is nothing like Mummy with Boris Karloff and if one expects it to be the same then one will be sorely disapointed. However, if one comes in and expects a thin action driven plot with plenty of special effects then this is a dandy of a movie. 4/5.</p></body></html>

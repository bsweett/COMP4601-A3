Having heard this movie mentioned so much, but not knowing the premise is what really caught me off-guard. What a freakin' spooky movie!!!  I loved the way the movie was pieced together after each spooky ocurrance, so that you knew what led up to the demise of each individual; instead of trying to guess. I especially liked the fact that it was made in Japan, and the some of the American actors had to try and communicate in Japanese.<br /><br />Let's see now... cats, attics, cell phones, closets. I think I should try and avoid all those things in the night from now on. What the heck was that noise? What was that little boy doing in my sink?<br /><br />Oh damn! I gotta' shampoo my hair in the morning (check for extra fingers in scalp), and then take the bus to work (look out for reflections in the window) I don't think I'm ever going to sleep in my bed again. That sofa is looking pretty good from here. Aaaaahhhhhhhhh!</p></body></html>

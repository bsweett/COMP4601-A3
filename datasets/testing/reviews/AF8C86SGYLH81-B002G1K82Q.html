Most of you are fed up and tired with my reviews of horror films that deal with extreme violence.  This review is the complete and exact opposite...a film of love...a film encased within the hearts of many people (my age) that truly enjoyed the "love" generation.<br /><br />"Across the Universe" has moved into my TOP THREE films of all time.  Immediately after I finished it, I wanted to see it again...much like my fever for "Jurassic Park" and something much more endearing as "When Harry Met Sally".  What's the comparison?<br /><br />"Across the Universe" is a visual anthology of everything that the legendary Beatles stood for.  Not within their crazy and bizarre real lives, but within the tone and realism of what their words and music stood for.<br /><br />I'd like to deem this movie a musical, but it goes far beyond that.  It is a love story of "Titanic" proportions, and a film that tugs at your emotions from start to finish...ONLY if you have ever been in love...yearned for love...lost your love...perhaps never really understood what love is all about.<br /><br />Bear with me.  I need to be clear and explicit with this review, my buds.  This film is one of, if not the best, I have ever seen.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the pure love and innocence of The Beatles music and lyrics are put into action in this incredibly romantic vision of love...love...love.<br /><br />I took notes as the film unfolded.  Here are some of my notes:<br /><br />"Coming from a movie maniac like me, when I say this is one of the best movies ever produced, please hear me out."<br /><br />"This is a tribute to The Beatles...their music and their message within the music...put to action in a priceless...moving...portrayal...by committed and caring Beatlemaniacs...like me."<br /><br />"I loved the classic films such as Jurassic Park, Forrest Gump, and Silence of the Lambs.  Across the Universe takes you back to reality...the turbulent Sixties...the tearful times when we lost lives in senseless combat...searching for love in all the RIGHT places...not fearful of crying...women or men."<br /><br />"How can you take 40-plus Beatles' love songs and not tug at the strings of your heart?"<br /><br />"If you don't cry in at least 10 different scenes, I question the devotion of your heart."<br /><br />"This is a beautiful love story of the Sixties...with incredible visuals that define The Beatles' music, message, and purpose in life."<br /><br />"If you only watch the scene where the song "I Want You...She's So Heavy" is so masterfully visualized, you'll get your money's worth."<br /><br />But it doesn't end there.<br /><br />"This film is an anthology of our times/lives from 1963 to 1973...a decade of love, peace and protest.  This film explains it all.  If you have ever loved from your heart, buckle your seatbelts and fathom this epic."<br /><br />"Can a movie tug at your heart for two hours?  Yes.  This one does.  Tears, hope, joy and sadness.  This one took me home my Buds.  My life was revisited in 120 minutes...as a veteran of the U.S. Army...a young man in love...an old man in love...all of my love...revisited by the melodic sounds of The Beatles."<br /><br />"The Beatles launched their career with epic love songs.  Enjoy them and the cast as they live within the lyrics."<br /><br />This movie is beautiful...profound...exhilarating.  There's something in the way it moves...it has  strawberry fields forever...and your guitar will gently weep.  It gives you All My Loving...and demands a response to the question...If I Fell.  Oh Darling...there's no room for Helter Skelter or a Revolution, but Lucy's Sky with Diamonds will send you on a journey ACROSS THE UNIVERSE that only true Beatle fans will ever understand.  Take the journey.<br /><br />This one, on a scale of 1-10...gets a solid TWENTY!<br /><br />Bottom line...ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE...LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED!<br /><br />No...I'm not pulling your leg.  This is one of the best films I have ever experienced.  It will live within my heart forever, because it represents so many things that are important to my/your generation....LOVE...LOVE.  That's all we need...the box</p></body></html>

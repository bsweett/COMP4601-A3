<meta name="summary" content="Not what I expected"></head><body><p>Upon renting this movie, I expected something along the lines of "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer," with some psychology and some serial killin'.  I was surprised to find very little actual killin' in this film, and a whole lot of psychology.  This movie is a character study, not a plot-driven narrative.  As such, it provides Charlize Theron with a real actor's showcase.  She takes full advantage of it, turning in a fantastic performance.  Christina Ricci does a fine job, too.  Given that we spend most of the movie with these two, their performances are critical, and they bring it strong.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this movie was its lack of plot.  It meandered around a bit much for me, and became a little tedious in points.  Also, it was a little too sympathetic to Wuornos.  It's clear how she got to where she was, but she is portrayed as a complete victim who at no point (well, perhaps one) has any control over her choices.<br /><br />"Monster" is at least worth a rent.</p></body></html>

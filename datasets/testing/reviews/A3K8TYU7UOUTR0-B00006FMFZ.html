<meta name="summary" content="A pleasure to watch"></head><body><p>This is one of the best movies of 2002. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is an enforcer in a 1930's Irish mob, led by kingpin, John Rooney (Paul Newman). Things are somber yet smooth until Sullivan's son witnesses a hit. The status quo is destroyed. No one is really comfortable with Sullivan's son being alive to tell the tale, yet Sullivan is like a son to his boss, John Rooney. Thus the conflict and the engine that drives the movie forward. <p>This is really a beautifully done movie in about every respect. The first striking thing is Tom Hanks cast as an Irish hit man. There is something about Tom Hanks that is mesmerizing on the screen, something extremely watchable. After enjoying him in different roles, like in Saving Private Ryan and Castaway and particularly this role, the best way to describe this quality is there is a depth of thought present in Hanks at all times, combined with a complete natural quality in front of the camera. It is a great piece of casting, setting Hanks against type as a man of violence, and it works in spades. Paul Newman has the role of a lifetime as John Rooney, "son of the old sod" and gang leader. Newman brought just the right blend of authority, power, and Irish melancholy to the role. The relationship between Sullivan and Rooney seems so believable, so understated and sincere, it is one of the most moving things about the movie. <p>This film is about fathers and sons, and there are three father/son relationships at stake here: Sullivan and his son, Rooney and his son (played with crazed zeal by Daniel Craig), and finally the relationship between the boss and his prime enforcer. In character parts, Stanley Tucci brings his usual dignity to the mix as  Frank Nitti, and Jude Law is creepy and nearly unrecognizable as Maguire, the contract killer sent to deal with Sullivan and son. <p>The other striking thing for me was the interesting and unique way the film dealt with violence. Nearly all the violence was off screen or just out of shot. The blood squirting plasma-sacs were at a minimum in this movie, and the scenes were so much more powerful for it. It particular, the Tommy Gun scene, where Hanks uses this weapon from the shadows (those that have seen the film will know which scene I mean) was shot with no sound except the musical soundtrack. Hank's gun just produces a strobe of silent flashes from the darkness. I believe this scene just as innovative as any of Sam Peckinpaw's "ballet of death" scenes from the late 60's and 70's. A great film with a gripping, well-rounded story. Clean and perfect all the way.</p></body></html>

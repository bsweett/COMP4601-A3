<meta name="summary" content="A tragic love story..."></head><body><p>Now that the hype surrounding Brokeback Mountain has started to die down, one can get past all of the superlatives heralding Ang Lee's film as a classic and all of the jokey puns on the film's title and concentrate on what makes it really work: the love story between two men. Much was made about it being the first mainstream movie about gay cowboys but it was also an achievement for Lee that he was able to bounce back from the commercial and critical disappointment that was Hulk.<br /><br />Heath Ledger has gone from teen comedies like 10 Things I Hate About You to such diverse roles as the ones in Lords of Dogtown and The Brothers Grimm. This performance may be his finest yet. It is a very internalized one. Ennis doesn't communicate very much verbally but rather through physical gestures and by his eyes. It also doesn't hurt that Ledger has the rugged good looks that are ideal for this role.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal turns in yet another excellent performance as a hopeless romantic stuck in a marriage with someone he doesn't truly love. One gets the feeling that the time away from Ennis affects him the most but it is only because it is visible in the way he acts and in his eyes. He's the one who pushes hardest from the two of them to discard their traditional lives and be together all the time. However, as the film progresses, we begin to realize that their time apart hurts Ennis just as much - he just keeps it bottled up inside.<br /><br />There is a touching intimacy to Jack and Ennis' relationship. It isn't just physical, it is also about companionship. When you spend that amount of time with someone you get to know them really well. It is the kind of relationship that changes the course of their lives. Ultimately, Brokeback Mountain is a tragic love story - even more so because we get to know Jack and Ennis so well. We become emotionally invested in their lives and we know that they can never be together in the way that they would like. Ang Lee's film is one of those rare ones that actually does live up to its hype and definitely worth a look.<br /><br />"On Being a Cowboy" takes a look at the cowboy camp that the actors went through so that they could get an idea of what that kind of life was like and portray it convincingly on camera. Ledger actually grew up on a farm and had plenty of experience riding horses.<br /><br />"Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee" is a love fest for the director. The cast praise his direction and talk about how much they admire him.<br /><br />"From Script to Screen: Interviews with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana" features the two screenwriters talking about their first reaction to Annie Proulx's short story that first appeared in the pages of The New Yorker.<br /><br />Finally, there is "Sharing the Story: The Making of Brokeback Mountain" that originally aired on the Logo channel. It follows your typical making of featurette that mixes interview soundbites with clips from the movie. This is a nice if not superficial look at the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DARK, CONFUSING AND DISAPPOINTING"></head><body><p>I wanted so bad to like this movie, and in fact was pretty sure I would.  The previews certainly looked good, and with Ang Lee at the helm of a big budget production featuring eye-popping CGI with all the resources of one of Marvel Comics' best series' to draw upon, what could go wrong?<p>Sadly, just about everything.<p>The origin sequence, which appears to be based more on Frankenstein than the Hulk comic book, is convoluted and disorienting.  There are too many flashbacks and throwing Bruce Banner's demented father into the mix was a terrible miscue. The basic gamma bomb origin from the comic is given a conspiracy theory angle that might have worked on the X-Files but flags miserably here and the film never recovers.  <p>The bulk of the film is uneven, slow, and pretentious.  There are too many badly developed but lengthy plot threads all playing out simultaneously--the gamma bomb, the military conspiracy, Bruce's relationship with Betty, Bruce's relationship with his father, Betty's relationship with HER father, the transformation of David Banner into the Absorbing Man--and everything just slowly unravels for an agonizing 138 minutes that actually seems like a lot more. <p>One would expect the action sequences to steal the show and atone for many sins, but in reality there aren't that many action scenes and the ones that we do see aren't always handled well.  A case in point is the Hulk's battle with the mutant dogs.  It's too dark to make out clearly and rather pointless anyway.  The Hulk's run-ins with the Army are much better but are a long time in coming, and the climactic showdown between Hulk and the Absorbing Man is for all its technical pyrotechnics highly unconvincing, with a resolution that is perhaps supposed to be mystical but is instead hopelessly absurd and totally unmoving.  <p>The cast clearly tries hard but has little to work with and the results are decidedly mixed.  Jennifer Connelly is an empathetic and engaging Betty Ross and makes a great damsel in distress, while Sam Elliott nails General Thunderbolt Ross dead-on.  On the other hand, Eric Bana, perhaps because he is shackled by such a disparate script, portrays a rather lifeless and unconvincing Bruce Banner.  Nick Nolte, definitely a talented actor by any measure, mumbles and stumbles his way through the movie as Bruce's maniacal father, David.  The role is an inherently bad one that should have been left out--it wasn't, and Nolte struggles in vain to do anything of value with it.<p>The FX and CGI on the other hand are quite good, and the unaccountably spartan action scenes are if nothing else spectacular, even if they often misfire.  The Hulk himself is a bit of an enigma, which is perhaps as it should be.  Though not especially realistic he is somehow lifelike, and is generally much more sympathetic than Bruce Banner himself.  There is a certain pathos in Hulk's animated features that most of the human actors never match.<p>The biggest problems with this movie are script and direction.  The storytellers tried to do too much and fell short.  The fact that alterations to the details of the comic book were made is not so much the problem as is the overall direction the movie tries to go in.  The decision to make a dark movie was not necessarily a bad one, but the execution is sorely lacking.  Tim Burton's Batman is a dark comic book adaptation as well, but it retains the wonder and fun of its source material.  Ang Lee's Hulk is just downright depressing. A less heavy-handed approach would have worked better.<p>For all that I don't like about this movie, I am glad the end leaves room for a possible sequel.  There is enough good in this effort to potentially build on, so perhaps the creators will learn from their mistakes and give the Hulk the movie he deserves.  Maybe we'll even get to see a CGI Abomination go toe to toe with a revitalized Hulk--what a battle that could be!  Until then, you might want to check out some of the old Bill Bixby and Lou Ferreigno episodes from the classic TV show.  They may look tame compared to the movie, but at least they make sense.</p></body></html>

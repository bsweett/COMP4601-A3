<meta name="summary" content="I liked it, but I just can't give it more than ***1/2 stars"></head><body><p>Garden State is a funny, slightly charming comedy about coming back home, finding yourself again, falling in love and letting the emotion grow where it was stopped dead by an event in your past. There really wasn't too many bad things to be said about this movie except for the fact that it was completely unmemorable and its storyline didn't seem to fit into the 102 minutes duration time of the film. After about 80 minutes I kept looking at the digital minute counter on my DVD player. So I guess what I'm trying to say was that it really dragged on.<br /><br />I'll give the movie some credit as far as interesting characters and catchy dialogue go. And there were some pretty funny parts throughout the picture. But this is just the kind of film I watch, enjoy it to an extent, and completely forget about it the next week.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good film for whole family!"></head><body><p>Awesome picture and audio quality. The central character rose a bit quickly from zero to hero, but you can't deny the appeal of the detail in the animation and the funny one liners. Loved Mantis-one of my favorite characters! The actors and voices were distinct; the characters seemed to stand on their own, unlike some of the other animated films, where it almost seems like the characters are cartoon versions of the actors. Very cool fight scenes and important message that appeals to parents and kids-strength of character is more important than some "secret ingredient"-a person directs his/her own course. Thoroughly enjoyed this film!</p></body></html>

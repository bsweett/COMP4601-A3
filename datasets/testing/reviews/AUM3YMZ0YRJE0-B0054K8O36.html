<meta name="summary" content="My son enjoyed it, but I found it excruciatingly boring"></head><body><p>This is one of those franchises that most parents must tolerate:  it is character-based, the story barely matters, and you either get it or you don't.  To be honest, I never have quite gotten it.  I like the actors very much, esp. Depp, but also the original cast of Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly, etc.  However, I find the plot, the entire concept, extremely lame, kind of an excuse for endless action sequences  that are simply tiring after a while.  The visual effects didn't carry it for me either.<br /><br />OK, Depp has a map of the Fountain of Youth.  Add to the intrigue an old lover of his, the amazing Penelope Cruz as well as Blackbeard, played by the wonderful Ian McShane.  Again, these are first rate actors.  So what happens?  They find it, with all sorts of sword fights, and sirens added into the mix, including Spanish Catholic fanatics who want to end all this pagan business.  It is an absolutely incoherent mess.  Nothing is believable, even my son barely laughed while maintaining that he liked it, and it fails to advance whatever the base story line is.<br /><br />I think this is a complete failure, merely trying to give more of the same to viewers who will pay.  I can't believe it is a Disney thing, which is unusually successful at adding magic to traditional stories or creating them.  Perhaps others that are better will follow, particularly with the ending and all the threads left hanging from the original trilogy.  But really, why bother?</p></body></html>

It is relentless in scary psychological undertones that play on the emotions, sympathy as much as terror and wonder.  Sissy Spacek is dynomite.  The filming is dynomite as well with touches of the 70s that you make you wonder how you survived this era.  Truly creepy but a very interesting drama as well.  Beauty and terror ride high in this feat by Brian DePalma - and the mind of Stephen King.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Basterds"></head><body><p>Inglourious Basterds was an ok film. It was amusing in it's own twisted way and the scalping can be a turn off for some. There are a lot of Nazi movies out there and this one is pretty good. The only thing i didn't like about the film was it was all subtitiles. I can handle subs usually but it was small and sometimes hard to read. Brad pitt did a good job and his charater was interesting. So all in all it's worth seeing. One of the better Nazi films.</p></body></html>

Hanks is the standout throughout and this Academy Award winning performance put him in the same class as Jimmy Stewart and Marlon Brando as one of the greatest actors of this or any other generation.  From Football star,  to War Hero,  to Shrimping Tycoon,  Forrest does it all.<p>  Youll laugh,  youll cry,  youll love Forrest Gump.  A must have!!!</p></body></html>

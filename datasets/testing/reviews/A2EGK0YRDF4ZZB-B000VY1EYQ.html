<meta name="summary" content="Serving up a heaping slice of sweet revenge..."></head><body><p>I first heard about Waitress due to the tragic murder of its writer / producer Adrienne Shelly shortly before the film was accepted at Sundance (Shelly wrote the script for Waitress while pregnant with her daughter Sophie, who appears in the film).<br /><br />Jenna (Keri Russell) finds out that her uber-controlling husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto) impregnated her after getting her drunk, and she's trapped in a loveless, abusive marriage and a dead-end job as a waitress in a Southern town. Jenna lives to invent pies that incorporate her latest obstacles and triumphs (I Don't Want Earl's Baby Pie, I Hate My Husband Pie, I Can't Have No Affair Because It's Wrong And I Don't Want Earl To Kill Me Pie).<br /><br />Fellow waitresses Dawn (Adrienne Shelly in her final role) and Becky (Cheryl Hines) serve as guardian angels of sorts, providing female companionship and a shoulder to lean on. Both are pursuing love affairs of their own, even as Jenna begins a passionate affair with the new OB, Dr. Pomatter.<br /><br />Diner owner Old Joe (Andy Griffith) is a persnickety customer who's always throwing out over-the-top demands and expecting every wish to be followed, but underneath the gruff exterior hides a heart of gold.<br /><br />The film has almost a fairytale quality due to the bright, primary colors, dream sequences, and yes, a fairy godfather of sorts. It took me a while to get into Waitress, but it was a mouthwatering spectacle that ultimately delights.</p></body></html>

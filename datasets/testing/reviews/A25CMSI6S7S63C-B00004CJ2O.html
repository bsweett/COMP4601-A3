<meta name="summary" content="A Lucky Day for Sean S Cunningham - uncut at last"></head><body><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was sort of a ground breaker for new slasher gore trends - setting a new level for graphic gore and so forth. It is really well done. This movie does contain Jason but not as you will see him in the sequels. This one has Betsy Palmer as Mrs Vorhees doing the killing. It is the mother this time, which reminded me of the mother themes of Psycho. If you listen closely to the soundtrack, you will see touches of the Psycho theme, of which this movie was inspired by. Psycho is the single most influential horror movie in terms of what films it paved the way for in horror. The gore effects by Tom Savini are good, it wasnt as gory as I had thought, even in its uncut form. Kevin Bacon fans, see his early work before he was in Tremors & so forth. The transfer for this - the day scenes are fantastic, the night scenes still are a little dark but better than previous releases.<br />I recommend this to any gore fans, between this and My Bloody Valentine, horror fans can rejoice to see some uncut above horror slasher horrors..<br />The bonus features - interview with Sean Cunningham, and the Friday the 13th reunion were very insightful. The Camp Blood tale part 1 was pretty gory & creepy...<br />Highly recommended for sure !</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="REAL GOOD EDGE OF UR SEAT THRILLER!!!"></head><body><p>This is a must-see action thriller that has an excellent story that dares to challenge the way we think about our legal system, but beware it is not intended for the squimish at heart considering its violent content (definately not one for the kids since rape, murder, and mutilation are all part of the package). I would agree with the other reviews, which in escence collectively agrees that this movie starts out strong in the beginning, but... it was almost as if they ran out of time towards the end and had to start chopping footage to get it all worked into their 2-hour package. I also felt it concluded to abruptly, elinating the big build-up that should have carried through from start to finish, hence the 4 Star rating as opposed to 5. Gerald Butler's performance was outstanding and he is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. As for Jamie Fox, this was a good transitioning role for him since once I got past that he was Jamie Fox (a nice reminder that it is still only a movie), I felt he was very believable in the role. In conclusion, it's definately a winner worth seeing for edge of your seat action/thriller</p></body></html>

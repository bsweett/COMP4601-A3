<meta name="summary" content="Action-packed Van Helsing has won me over!"></head><body><p>I have to say that I am not familiar with any Van Helsing comics, games or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Van Helsing prior to the film I have to say that the movie was FANTASTIC!<br />There are slight hints of James Bond, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and strong/obvious elements of Frankenstein and Dracula, so the movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.<br />Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, and Richard Roxburgh, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding, making this movie one of the best of its kind. The setting, the special effects, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful!<br />After The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, Stephen Sommers has scored another major hit with this action-packed movie!  In short, I would definitely line up to watch a sequel!</p></body></html>

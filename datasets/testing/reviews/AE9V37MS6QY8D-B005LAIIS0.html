<meta name="summary" content="Three-and-a-half stars for a film that's different than you'd think!"></head><body><p>This film further proves the bad@$$ coolness that is Liam Neeson. But it's not just because he's a man who knows the wilderness and can kill wolves, it's because of Neeson's range from tough-as-nails to deeply poignant in a role that Neeson doesn't usually take: that of a suicidal man on the edge. And while the story is quite simple -- a Dylanesque (Thomas, not Bob) "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night" -- writer/director Joe Carnahan (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VEJKQI">Smokin' Aces [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004856SQ8">The A-Team (+ Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray</a>]) presents that story in a survival genre that the general public is not quite used to seeing. This film does promote hope and faith, but it also is gritty and violently real. Indeed, this survival story goes another route but nevertheless delivers a meaningful message. Despite the sad underusage of James Badge Dale, the rest of the cast, besides Neeson (particularly Dallas Roberts, Dermot Mulroney and Frank Grillo), shine. The film is not as good as I thought it would be but that's only because it ended differently than I thought. Plus, I REALLY wanted to see that fight!</p></body></html>

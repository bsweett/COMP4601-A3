<meta name="summary" content="Blood on the tracks"></head><body><p>"Derailed" was Swedish filmmaker Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m's first American picture. It stars Clive Owen as a man who is having an affair with a woman he met on a train, played by Jennifer Aniston. He's about to have an affair, anyway - because before they can get down to it, a man bursts into their hotel room, takes all their money, beats up Clive, and then rapes Aniston. When Owen returns home, the man calls him and demands $20,000, or he'll tell Owen's wife about the affair. Owen delivers, gets punched again, end of story.<br /><br />Or so Owen thinks. But then the man calls him again, this time demanding $100,000; earlier in the film it's established that Clive has been saving that money for seven years to pay for a new drug for his diabetic daughter. Yet again, he has no choice but to pay up. But Owen needs that money for his daughter, and finally he decides to turn the tables. However, things are not as they seem.<br /><br />Despite the harsh reviews it received upon its release, "Derailed" is not a train wreck. There are just as many good things as there are bad. Ultimately, it's a mostly dull movie with a few moments of genuine excitement toward the end. If you can make it that far, well done. You will be rewarded. Unfortunately, many people won't make it that far, because there's just no life in the picture. Owen is trying hard, but he can't hold the picture up on himself alone. Aniston is lukewarm in her scenes. The blackmailer, played by Vincent Cassel, is thoroughly hateable, but Cassel doesn't bring anything new to the role.<br /><br />The transition to American films for foreign directors can be hard even for the best of them (look at Jean-Pierre Jeunet's "Alien: Resurrection," or "Hard Target" by John Woo). Under the circumstances, H?fstr&ouml;m does well. It's clear that he has style, but either not enough or not the right style for this particular film. Toward the end of the movie he lets loose and crafts a few thrilling scenes, but the rest of the movie is a dully-colored drama about people we don't care about in a situation that's nothing new.<br /><br />After all, Owen isn't like Lester Burnham in "American Beauty." He has a family he loves, and although it's lacking the romance it once had, he's not unhappy. He still kisses his wife, he still helps his daughter with her schoolwork. When he decides to have the affair with Aniston, they both know it's wrong. But they're turned on, and so they do it anyway. There's nothing special about these characters, and nothing to make us sympathize with them. The "couple having an affair gets blackmailed" routine is getting very stale. There have been a wealth of wannabe-seductive affair movies in the last decade, and "Derailed" offers little new.<br /><br />So in the end, is "Derailed" worth watching? Sure. You could do better, but you could also do worse. The twists which begin appearing about 3/4 of the way through the film are worth sitting through the first three parts for, if you can do so. As a drama, "Derailed" is stale and uninteresting, and as a thriller, Derailed offers a few scenes of excitement and a whole lot of the same old stuff. Ironically, the downfall of "Derailed" is that it stays on the track and never goes off in some interesting and foreign direction.</p></body></html>

This time he has to battle the evil dead in medieval times as he quests for the Necronomicon, the book of the dead, so he can get home. Cleverly scripted and imaginatevly directed, with some quite amusing  wise-cracks and creative costumes. This DVD edition is THX mastered, so he  quality is crispy and clear, and  some of the sound effects will rock your  living room. It also contains the orginal ending which is very grim and  kind of spooky, the theatrical trailer, a documentary on the special  effects department which is very interesting, and talent bios which are  very radable. Above all, a worthy DVD disk that well worth your money.</p></body></html>

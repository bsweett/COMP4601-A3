<meta name="summary" content="Scorsese's "Hour of the Wolf""></head><body><p>I'd have to see "Shutter Island" again to really gage whether it is above or below Scorsese's potential--my original viewing of "The Departed" was quick, rushed, and though I recognized it was above average, I made the mistake of not realizing how intricate and masterfully crafted it really was.  A long standing Martin Scorsese fan, I think his hardcore fans must have the feeling that the man's mind is moving in darker and darker avenues these days.  Though the end of this one is a little less "doom wins" then "Departed", it echoes a similar sentiment: mankind can never really grasp truth, and oftentimes lives in elaborately constructed avenues of corruption rather than facing the truth and dealing with it. Scorsese's grip on his Catholicsm has become tenuous at best.<br /><br />There are questions Scorsese deliberately evades to make us wonder a bit more.  What was in the cigarettes so generously passed out in the asylum?  Why are Max Von Sydow (echoing Dr. Mengele and the Nazi threat) and Ben Kingsley (with plans that may be real? for an unethical "energy treatment" of the mentally ill, echoing the A Bomb) conducting such a ridiculously lengthy experiment on this patient in particular?  How did they know a storm would take place before the "ferry" left?  Is the director also making a negative comment on the advent of psychotropic drugs, hospitals, etc before they were thoroughly developed and maximized by the state?<br /><br />The revelation about Teddy Daniels at the end of the film did not at all surprise or shock me.  There were times--for instance, when Daniels is questioning a "patient" about her role in the disappearance of a fictitious child murderer--where it seems as though David Lynch had stepped in to Scorsese's shoes to say: "Everyone's insane!"  The flashbacks to the concentration camps were so disturbingly effective that I'd put them on par with quite a few quality holocaust films, though of course it isn't *just* about his experiences at the camps.  Mahler blasts, roses fall, SS officers die, and Teddy winds his way through a psychological maze right to his own--also uncertain and vague--ending.  Why would a guy who shot someone under those particular circumstances consider himself a complete, unredeemable monster?  That was my main foible with the film--Teddy loathes himself *that much* for snapping when his children have just been drowned, etc?  His crime was capital, of course, but anyone could have argued for an insanity plea.  Indeed they could have.<br /><br />But this only points to the moral heart of the story.  We do not know everything, we cannot know everything, and some ideas of right and wrong, what we have or haven't done, can never be clearly and crisply answered.  This is the darkest Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen--it is to his film canon what "Hour of the Wolf" was to Bergman's: a thorough exploration of the artists' subconscious.  While I won't say at all that this matches up to "The Departed", it is certainly one of Scorsese's more vulnerable films and not to be missed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More about political Maggie and less about old Mags"></head><body><p>Even though Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister when I was in my 20's, politically, I really did not know what made her tick.  Unfortunately, this film does little to answer my questions (and I assume many of the questions asked by many of its viewers.)<br /><br />What the film does is spend a lot of time on her declining years and her dimetenia.  As for Meryl Streep, she gives a fine perfomance that is hampered by the final cut.  Did she deserve an Oscar nomination, maybe.  Did she deserve to win, definitely not.  As for the make-up, as young Margaret, Meryl looks nothing like her.  She is too beautiful.  I guess vanity would not let her be made down to look like an average woman.  But the old age make-up is fantastic.  Unfortunately, between the two, the old age is easier to accomplish and therefore less important.<br /><br />The worst part of the film, is that it never trusts itself.  It uses gimmicks to tell the story.  While there has been many films that have successfully used flashback to tell a story, this film uses it to disguise the film's shortcummings.<br /><br />I guess I will have to wait for Masterpiece Theatre to do a story on Maggie to get a full understanding of her inner mind.</p></body></html>

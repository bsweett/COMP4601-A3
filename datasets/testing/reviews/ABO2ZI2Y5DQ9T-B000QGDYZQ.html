<meta name="summary" content="Sandra Bullock Is Excellent, But ... What Is the Point Anyway?"></head><body><p>Sandra Bullock plays Linda Hanson, a wife and mother of two daughters. One day, after receiving terrible news about her husband Jim (Julian McMahon), she starts to have promotion - or I should say, she begins to experience things in "un-chronological" order.<br /><br />I know my review is vague, but this is all that I can say without giving away the major plot elements. But I can add these yet: 1) Sandra Bullock is quite convincing as the tormented heroine, whose uncanny ability might or might not change the course of events. Most viewers would be impressed with her solid performance. 2) The material itself is fascinating, but the execution is ineffective with implausible situations and unlikely (even stupid) decisions by the characters. 3) Perhaps this is the most important. Her premonition (or whatever it is) looks convoluted, but the film's plot itself is fairly predictable. When Amber Valletta appears in one scene, most of you will instantly detect the identity of her character.<br /><br />But what is really annoying is the attempt of the filmmakers trying hard to make the film profound when it is not. Director Mennan Yapo tries to give the film dramatic tension by introducing some elements - psychiatrist and priest - but they not only hit the wrong note, but confuse the already complicated story of the main character Linda. To make matters worse, supports are almost insignificant. Nia Long and Kate Nelligan appear, but their characters have virtually nothing to do.<br /><br />"Premonition" is built from several intriguing premises, but it is frustrating to see them wasted in the messy screenplay.<br /><br />Not to be confused with Japanese film "Premonition," which has nothing to do with this Sandra Bullock film.</p></body></html>

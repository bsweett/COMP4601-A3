<meta name="summary" content="Now THIS is Tom Cruise's best performance of recent years!"></head><body><p>When you combine the talents of superstar Tom Cruise ("Vanilla Sky", "Top Gun") and director Steven Spielberg ("A.I.", "Jurassic Park"), there's nothing that can stop them from bringing a great film to the big screen, and "Minority Report" is no exception whatsoever! I have seen this film twice at the theater and I can't get enough of it! We have seen Spielberg give us some extraordinary classics, such as "Jaws", "E.T.", the "Indiana Jones" films, and "Jurassic Park", and a questionable film such as "A.I. Artificial Intelligence". But now, Spielberg has certainly outdone himself with "Minority Report", a film loaded with action and thrills galore, powerful drama, and cutting edge special effects that only Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) can provide us with! And as far as the performance from Tom Cruise goes, it was a performance that couldn't be better! Possibly the best Cruise performance since the "Mission: Impossible" films! "Minority Report" takes place in Washington, DC in the year 2054. There is a new brand of law enforcement called the Department of Precrime. Precrime uses psychics called "Pre-Cogs" to help the officers see the perpetrator committing his/her crime and to stop them before it is actually committed. As for Precrime chief John Anderton (Cruise), he is among those that believes in this system being perfect and that it is never wrong...until now! Shockingly, as it turns out, Anderton is being set up for a murder that he didn't even commit! And so begins an action-packed journey as Anderton races against time to clear his name, reclaim his life, and to find out who framed him and why. In closing, "Minority Report" not only has an outstanding performance from Tom Cruise, but an impressive supporting cast including Max Von Sydow ("Judge Dredd"), Colin Farrell ("Hart's War", "American Outlaws"), Samantha Morton ("Sweet and Lowdown"), Kathryn Morris ("The Contender"), Neal McDonough ("Star Trek: First Contact"), Tim Blake Nelson ("O Brother, Where Art Thou"), Jessica Capshaw ("Valentine"), Patrick Kilpatrick ("Free Willy 3"), and Peter Stormare ("Armageddon"). "Minority Report" is, without a doubt, one of the absolute best sci-fi action thrillers ever made since "Blade Runner". This is an absolute DVD must-own to any Steven Spielberg or Tom Cruise collection!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Forgotten is forgettable"></head><body><p>I can't say much about this film as it is just a real dud.  The plot is totally unbelievable although it has a clever premise.  The acting is strictly by the numbers, the direction pedestrian at best, and the effect were just average.  Maybe I'll rewrite this review when I'm in a better mood, but for now, this is film is one to forget renting or buying.</p></body></html>

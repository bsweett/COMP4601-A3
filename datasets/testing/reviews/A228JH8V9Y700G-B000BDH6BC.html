I am not a fan of John Singleton, nor do I go out of my way to watch gangst related movies or listen to music, but this was an interesting movie in so many ways.<br /><br />The Four Brothers, Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah and Jack, have reunited over the death of their adoptive mother.  Gunned down seemingly at random in a local grocery store, the four return to their hometown of Detroit for her funeral.  They discover that their mother's murder wasn't exactly a random act of violence but part of a larger plot whose motivations seem unknown.  They go out on the prowl, attempting to find how it is that their mother, a seemingly insignifigant person, is connceted to a sticky web of crime from the police department through the crime kingpins of Detroit.<br /><br />This was a good movie in the fact that you know from the beginning that there is far more to their mother's murder than meets the eye.  They will eventually overturn rocks and stones to find out more.  The obvious comic relief of Angel's Latino girlfriend's hot blooded explosions make for some funny moments.  Their past as troubled kids will aid their search (breaking into houses, firearms, etc.), making them forces to be reconed with.  Their obvious distain for the police and knowledge of police tactics to make them confess to something they didn't do also makes them smarter and crafier than the "bad guys" and "good guys".  Plus the violence of Detroit as a backdrop always make for good times.  Why not five stars?  The plot eventually thins out towards the end.  Even after seeing it once, I had to watch it a second time to understand exactly what their mother's murder had to do with this crime wave in Detroit.  Yet, it's a good movie about love and family even under the dreariest of circumstances.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very interesting twist..."></head><body><p>on your typical alien-movie. I stumbled across this on cable while channel-surfing and I watched the whole thing. I don't think it is a spoiler to say that the gist of the movie is that a very large and damaged alien spaceship enters Earth orbit. Over 1 million stranded aliens are taken of the ship. What is to be done with them? I won't say any more but the plot is original and interesting. The only downsides is that the moralizing is slightly heavy-handed (no coincidence that the story is set in South Africa) and there was a bit of a devolution into traditional Hollywoodism (gun fights, car crashes, people blowing up, etc.).<br /><br />Also, the film is shot (in the beginning) in the style of a mockumentary (similar to Blair Witch or Cloverfield) which gives it a grittier and more realistic feel. The ending is maddeningly ambiguous (in a good way) as opposed to the cliche good winds, bad loses, and everything is right in the world. Nice touch.<br /><br />I thought this was a unique movie in an over-done genre.<br /><br />4.5 stars<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

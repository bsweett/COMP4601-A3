<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - The Movie"></head><body><p>So i have to say, this is one of the rare times that I liked the movie better than the book.  That's not to say the book isn't good, they're all pretty fantastic, but I've never cared for the second as much as I have some of the other ones.  And speaking of second, if you haven't read the first book or watched the first movie what on earth are you doing reading this?  Go check those out!<br /><br />The Chamber of Secrets explores Harry's second year at Hogwarts.  Rescued from his muggle aunt and uncle by Ron and his brothers, he heads to Ron's house to await the start of the term.  But things keep going from bad to worse and when he can't get to the train, he and Ron decide to take a magical car to Hogwarts, with mixed results.  From there other strange things begin happening at Hogwarts and it's hurting the students, especially the Muggle born ones.  Harry and Co. can't help but get mixed into the problem and adventures abound!<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe:  Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley<br />Emma Watson: Hermione Granger<br />Kenneth Branagh: Gilderoy Lockhart<br />Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid<br />Richard Harris: Albus Dumbledore<br />Jason Isaacs: Lucius Malfoy<br />Alan Rickman: Severus Snape<br />Tom Felton: Draco Malfoy<br /><br />As usual I thought the cast did a superb job.  Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson make a great team and have wonderful camaraderie on the set.  Each plays their part exactly as you envision from the book.  Branagh was ok, I guess I just pictured something different for Lockhart and while he does pull of the smarmy self-centered aspect well, there was just something there missing for me.  The same with Harris, I really wish Dumbledore would play a larger role in these movies, but his screentime seems to be limited.  All of the supporting cast were pretty good though and I can't think of any I'd wish to replace with someone else.  They certainly bring the wizards and witches of Harry Potter to life.<br /><br />The plot was pretty well paced.  As said before I liked the movie better than the book for this one (not by much, but a little) and even though it followed the book pretty well, this one just seemed to be more exciting.  Especially the action scenes, not to spoil too much, but I'm not a big fan of spiders and definitely got creeped out by the ones in this movie.  There were a couple things from the book that I wish had been included, but I understand the limitation of time and that they can't fit everything in there.  I also liked that they paid attention to the detail of the books down to the moving pictures and foods in the movie.<br /><br />The cinematography was excellent, as usual.  I like how they incorporate magic and even the Quidditch looks real.  Makes you want to grab a broomstick and jump off your balcony (just kidding of course!).  It's amazing what they were able to do considering how much of the movie had to be generated and yet it still looks life like.  The music too is wonderful, and the instrumentals that accompany every Harry Potter movie are chilling yet exciting at the same time.  I don't think it would be a worthwhile movie without the music actually.  It's just as big of a part as the plot is.<br /><br />Great movie, great series.  Can't wait to watch the next!<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man lives again!"></head><body><p>After an eye-opening stint as a hostage in Afghanistan, multi-zillionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) gives up being a merchant of death to don a high-tech suit of his own invention and fight for justice and atonement as Iron Man.  This is a top-notch debut effort from Marvel Studios and hopefully portends more great movies to come.<br /><br />That said, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first two Spider-Man films.  A superhero really benefits from having a great villain to battle; Spider-Man has the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, Batman has the Joker, but Iron Man really never had such an arch-nemesis, even in the comics.  Maybe the Mandarin came closest (and there's a subtle nod to the character in the name of the terrorist organization The Ten Rings), but he's too mystical to be a good fit in a movie like this.  So for a finale we get Stark Industries CEO Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) in an even bigger suit.  By the end of this somewhat underwhelming climax, I was getting flashbacks to Robocop.  Nevertheless, the cast is great, the script is smart, and director Jon Favreau shows a sure hand with this material.  I'm looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />The final line of the film is perfect.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stunning performance, stunted script"></head><body><p>I have to confess, I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II is nothing short of stunning, and is much deserving of the Oscar and all other awards bestowed upon her... The script, however, left me a bit flat. It seemed rather conventional and TV-movie-of-the-weekish, and rather insular as well. Screenwriter Peter Morgan assumes a great deal from his audience, most of all that we have already shared in the media mania that surrounded Princess Diana, and are all well steeped in the twists and turns of her life story, and in her relationship to the royal family. Of course, millions and millions of people are well-versed in the minutae of that story, but for those of us who were casual and neutral observers, this movie does a poor job explaining what transpired, and the significance of various events and personal histories. A great deal of familiarity with the royal family is taken for granted, and we are expected to know their personalities -- the steadfast Elizabeth, the dithering Prince Charles, the bigoted Prince Philip. We're also expected to know their place in the national psyche of Great Britain, and to really feel the dramatic heft and social significance of the commoners rebelling against the old-world propriety of the nobles. In many regards, it's amazing that this film played as well as it did to the American audience... I suppose it's due to two factors, the enduring tabloid appeal of the late Diana, and to Helen Mirren's masterful performance. It's an impressive bit of acting, buoyed by other first-class actors... Bravo, Ms. Mirren... On to bigger and greater triumphs!</p></body></html>

His chief rival Alfred Borden is standing trial for his murder although it appears he's innocent.  As `The Prestige' unveils its many layers the audience is taken deep into the lives of these two men, into what made them who they are, what drove them apart and into rivalry and what ultimately will become of each man in the end.  At doing this `The Prestige' excels masterfully.  Director Christopher Nolan is building quite the reputation for himself.  He expertly crafts this film, layering each newfound discovery about these men so that the audience is completely entranced.  He uses his cast as they should be, allowing them to shine yet never overpower the brilliance of the film or give away too much of themselves too soon.  `The Prestige' is one of those near perfect films that comes along only once in a great while, a film that one can truly adore, stand behind and find fascinating with every viewing.  That's one of the greatest things about `The Prestige'.  With each and every viewing the audience is able to spot more pieces of the puzzle, things throughout the film they had never caught before but now know to look for.<br /><br />The storyline is engrossing as well, and that as we know is truly the most important facet to a film of this caliber.  The film follows the lives of two rival magicians as I mentioned, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden.  Robert and Alfred at one time worked together as assistants to another well known magician.  Despite what some of the reviews would have you believe, they were not friends.  In fact it's quite obvious that Robert does not trust Alfred, not in the least.  When a mistake on the part of Alfred's costs Robert's wife Julia her life he vows to avenge her.  As the magicians go their separate ways Robert's obsession grows.  He sabotages Alfred's shows, and Alfred retaliates likewise.  Things truly take a turn for the worse though when Alfred incorporates an act in his show that cannot be understood or duplicated.  This drives Robert mad and he desperately works to uncover his secret.  In search for answers he develops a nifty trick of his own thanks in large part to a scientist named Tesla, and with his new trick firmly in tact he sets out to destroy Alfred once and for all.<br /><br />The climax of this film, which takes us back to the beginning almost and unveils the mystery behind Anglier's death, is utterly orgasmic, at least to me and everyone who has watched the film with me so far.  The film is slow paced yet entrancing and so when the ending creeps up on you after strongly built anticipation you'll be kicking yourself for not picking up on it.  The greatest thing about the conclusion is that after the credits start to roll you'll be trying to place all the pieces together and will desire to watch the film once more to see if you missed something, which most likely you have.<br /><br />The acting is brilliant as well, especially on the part of Christian Bale.  Bale has always been one of my favorite actors but he never seems to pick a movie that is as well crafted as his skill.  In films like `American Psycho' and `The Machinist' he proves to be the best part of the film and without him the movie kind of falls apart.  Here though he finally found a film worth his talent.  He is so commanding, so engrossing and just as intriguing as the film itself; most definitely best in show.  High Jackman is also quite impressive.  He had a great year in 2006, and while I preferred his performance in `The Fountain' I must say that I was blown away here as well.  Michael Caine, one of our finest working actors, a true legend, does not disappoint and delivers an outstanding supporting performance as Cutter, a mentor to either men at one time or another.  There are a few women in this film, and each of them hold there own.  Piper Perabo proves in her very limited screen time as Julia to be an actress we should see more of.  I don't know what happened to this girl but someone needs to book her as a lead and let her talent truly shine.  Scarlett Johansson is fantastic as always as Olivia, assistant to either men at one time or another.  She perfectly balances her own sexuality with a commanding aura.  She is, without question, one of our most talented working actresses.  It's Rebecca Hall though that really stands out for me.  As Sarah, Alfred loving wife, she perfectly shifts between infatuation and intolerance, between admiration and impatience and dire frustration.  Her performance is heartbreaking to say the least.<br /><br />In the end `The Prestige' comes very close to making my top five films of 2006 for there is not a moment within that I am bored, dissatisfied or lost.  It's one of those rare gems that just seems to fit in every possible way and soars high above the rest of the competition.  I have a feeling that we are soon to see some spectacular things from director Christopher Nolan, even more spectacular then the brilliance he's already dealt to his audience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mediocre Movie, few thrills"></head><body><p>I watched the Sentinel a few weeks ago and have thought about writing a review ever since. The movie, a political thriller set in Washington DC, was so uninspiring that I found it hard to put my thoughts into words. I guess the main point is you should not watch this movie for Keifer Sutherland. If you're a 24 fan, then you might be intrigued by this movie. It is one of Sutherland's few big screen appearances since becoming the star of 24. In Sentinel, Sutherland plays Jack Bauer without the motivation, the nuances or the common sense. You'll see nothing new in Sutherland. Eva Longoria plays his rookie partner. The movie needed a good looking cast member for a thankless, generic part, so they got someone with a name. Michael Douglass and Kim Basinger also star and they both are good in their roles and made the movie someone tolerable. In fact, I enjoyed parts of the movie and most of the cast was on top of their game, but the suspense and action scenes were clumsily put together and hard to follow.<br /><br />Michael Douglass plays a secret service agent assigned to First Lady. It seems he had a falling out with Sutherland concerning Sutherland's wife. The final line in the movie about Sutherland and his wife is cringe inducing and an example of incredible mediocricy in filmmaking. I can't really even recommend this movie as a rental. Perhaps you can check it out on HBO like I did.</p></body></html>

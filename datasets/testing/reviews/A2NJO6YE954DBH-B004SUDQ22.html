<meta name="summary" content="There is proof and then there is proof"></head><body><p>According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, there are several definitions of the word "proof" that apply to the movie of the same name adapted from the David Auburn play.  The etymology of the word can be traced back to the Latin "probare," meaning, "to prove."  Both parts of the first definition of "proof" as a noun come into play: "(a) the cogency of evidence that compels acceptance by the mind of a truth or a fact; (b) the process or an instance of establishing the validity of a statement especially by derivation from other statements in accordance with principles of reasoning."  But there is also another meaning of proofs that is relevant to the story, which in the field of mathematics, where a proof is a demonstration that, assuming certain axioms, some statement is necessarily true.<br /><br />Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the daughter of a Robert (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant mathematician who has recently died.  Robert made two enormous contributions to the field when he was in his early 20s and then got "sick," a euphemism by which his family and friends referred to his schizophrenia when they were not coming right out and saying the man went mad.  Catherine followed in her father's footsteps, studying mathematics, albeit at a different university, and she is worried that maybe she is like him in having mental problems as well.  After all, her father is dead and she is still having conversations with him.  But she has more immediate concerns because now that Robert is dead, the vultures are circling down.<br /><br />There is Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), who was Robert's student and has taken it upon himself to go throw the dozens of notebooks in which he scribbled mathematical formulas and insane ramblings.  Catherine suspects Hal is looking for something that he can steal as his own to make his own reputation, and hitting on her does not make her think much more of him.  Claire (Hope Davis), her sister comes in from out of town, sells their father's house from under Catherine, whom she seems convinced, is having mental problems.  Then Catherine gives Hal a notebook, and in the notebook there is a proof (of the mathematical sort).<br /><br />The proof appears to be brilliant, but that, of course, has to be proven.  But then Catherine claims that she and not Robert is the author of the proof.  Both Hal and Claire find this hard to believe, and on some level Catherine has doubts as well.  Is she a brilliant mathematician like her father, trying to attain a validation now that she never received before, or is she simply schizophrenic?  More importantly, what would constitute sufficient proof to prove any or all of the above?<br /><br />I have not had a math class since I was a freshman in high school when I took geometry, so I have no clue what the math geeks in this movie are talking about, but that is okay because it is the idea of the proof and not the proof itself that matters in "Proof."  But when I stopped taking math courses I started participating in debate, so I know something about the fine art (if not science) of argument and how to prove things.  The irony here is that neither Hal nor Claire, nor Catherine for that matter, seek any proof.  They all make assumptions and the only relevant evidence has to do with penmanship.  This leads to the question of what sort of proof we would be willing to accept, but director John Madden is not leaving that to chance.<br /><br />"Proof" will appeal to those who are interested in the fine line between genius and madness, even if that idea is becoming overly related to the field of mathematics in movies of late.  Paltrow's character is at the heart of the story and virtually every scene is between her and the other characters.  Hopkin's character goes from lucidity to ravings, but what matters is how Paltrow reacts to him, because they constitute the key proof as to her emotional state and mathematical abilities.  Jake Gyllenhaal's character goes with whichever way the wind is blowing, but it is Davis who's compassion and concern for her Catherine is chilling, so there was a strong sense in how I wanted Claire to be wrong more than I wanted Catharine to be right.</p></body></html>

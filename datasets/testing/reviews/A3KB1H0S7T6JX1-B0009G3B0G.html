<meta name="summary" content="Not Bad, but Not Great either"></head><body><p>The Jacket brings to the screen the story of a Persian Gulf War veteran who ends up in an asylum for the criminally insane for a crime that he didn't commit.  However, all is not what it seems in the mental hospital...<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good, the plot is interesting (if not far fetched), while the dialogues are average and sometimes below average.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.</p></body></html>

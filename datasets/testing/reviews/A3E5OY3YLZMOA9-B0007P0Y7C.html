Right about towards the end of this movie you start feeling like did I miss a scene because I just went to the bathroom for a second and boom elektra's fighting the last battle to save the treasure, for example in the beginning elektra is very tense and unable to show any type of emotion and then about 15 maybe  20 minutes into the movie without showing any interest or feelings she's kissing Goran Visnjic. I really think that elektra was put together a bit sloppy because it seems like the cast was willing to give everything they had and the crew just wanted to get everything done before lunch. The acting in this movie wasn't great it was like they were shooting elektra the tv series episode 15 not the movie and it seemed rushed. I gave elektra 4 stars because besides the ok acting and the rushed scenes the fight scenes and camera work was amazing if it diddn't have that this movie hits a rock above rock bottom.</p></body></html>

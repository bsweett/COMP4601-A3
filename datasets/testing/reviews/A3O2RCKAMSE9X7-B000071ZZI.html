<meta name="summary" content="Matt Seeks his Own Identity"></head><body><p>Watching THE BOURNE IDENTITY brings to mind numerous previous spy films in which an agent may be a turncoat and has to be brought in from the cold.  In order for this genre to resonate the audience has to empathise with the agent so that they can feel his concern and his peril.  Car chases, explosions, and exotic locales ought to be used to further cement the relation between viewer and hero, rather than divert the former in accepting the derring-do of the latter. What director Doug Liman presents is a non-stop action thriller that tries so hard to thrill that credibility goes out the window early on.<p>Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is a surprisingly youthful amnesia victim plucked from the ocean by Italian sailors.  He has two bullets lodged in him, yet after only two weeks he is able to do heavy physical lifting.  In a nutshell, these rapidly healed bullet wounds suggest the film's major weakness: the audience is asked to take Bourne's physical presence as reason enough to overlook some pretty big holes placed there by logical slugs.  Bourne does not even know that he speaks Italian, Dutch, French, or German until he faces native speakers of those languages.  His mastery of the martial arts is closer to the fighting of THE MATRIX than to any legitimate style.  <p>There is a scene in which Bourne and a local woman (Franka Potente) are interrupted in a moment of passion by a hired assassin who battles Bourne in a manner more than suggestive of Robert Redford in a like situation from THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, complete right down to a knife sticking out of the assassin's shoe.  Further, the ongoing but futile attempts of the CIA to track what they deem as a turncoat agent seem a pale comparison to a similar hunt from DAY OF THE JACKAL.  What all these logical gaffes suggest is that to create a spy thriller a director need not do more than have a youthful and handsome hero, an equally attractive female lead, numerous hand to hand clashes, and frequent use of exotic locale.  The directors of THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and DAY OF THE JACKAL could offer Doug Liman some useful tips on how to do just that.</p></body></html>

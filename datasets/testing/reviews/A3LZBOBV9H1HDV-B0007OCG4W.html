<meta name="summary" content=""Closer" is brilliant, smart, powerful!"></head><body><p>"Closer" is a brilliantly smart human drama that is powerful at the very end. Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen (who won the Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor Golden Globes and were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor, which were well deserved nominations and wins) give incredibly mesmerizing performances that are their best performances of their careers, thus far! This is Mike Nichols' best film since "Primary Colors" (1998). It's beautiful, sad, and, at times, trustful. One of last year's best!</p></body></html>

I'm just a kid from Brooklyn."<br /><br />After being deemed unfit for military service, Steve Rogers volunteers for a top secret research project that turns him into Captain America, a superhero dedicated to defending America's ideals.<br /><br />size="+2">REVIEW<br /><br />Slam-bam crackerjack origin story of the classic Marvel Comics' titular patriotic hero (with an amiable Chris Evans) AKA Steve Rogers, a 98 lb. scrawny kid from Brooklyn trying to do his gung-ho best for America during WWII, finding himself transformed into a pec-laden super soldier and facing the nefarious Nazi villain Johann Schmidt - AKA The Red Skull (a fierce steely-eyed Hugo Weaving) - hell bent on world domination. Along for the ride are the estimable Stanley Tucci as the German &eacute;migr&eacute; scientist Erskine whose top-secret serum gives the hero his juice; Tommy Lee Jones as crusty as ever as the taciturn Colonel Phillips and comely aide de camp Peggy Carter (the luscious Hayley Atwell), all provide fine ensemble work. Credit yeoman director Joe Johnston to let Christopher Markus' & Stephen McFeeley's adaption fly freely with a peppering of humor and pathos, great rousing score by veteran composer Alan Silvestri; ace sepia toned cinematography by Shelly Johnson, evoking the era perfectly; expert production design by Rick Heinrichs and great costumes by Anna B. Sheppard. The 3-D is pretty nifty with Cap's trusty shield thrown your way for good measure; Saturday matin&eacute;e vibe only adds to the movie magic.</p></body></html>

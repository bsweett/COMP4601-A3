At least James Cameron knew better than to muddy up the waters, knew better than to mess up the perfect ending. In Hollywood, though, it's all about milking that cow dry, and the Terminator franchise was too lucrative, much too much of a good thing, to leave alone. Hell, the Governator couldn't turn down a third installment. Except without Cameron helming it and with Nick Stahl's negligible turn as John Connor (and with Arnie no longer looking so spry), TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES came up blah. And they still, still, still wouldn't let it rest.<br /><br />TERMINATOR: SALVATION feels like, looks like, smells like a lead-in to yet further sequels. Putting down the cup of haterade for a sec, I will admit that it's a technically well-executed film. It brims with dazzling special effects, soaks in gritty, ominous atmosphere, and is marked with Sam Worthington's very good performance. It's the story itself that is found wanting. A story with this post-apocalyptic premise, in which the human race is on the verge of obliteration, it should make you want to root for humanity's survival. But, thanks to some weak characterization, I find myself not really giving a toss for anyone except for Sam Worthington's character.<br /><br />If the trailer hadn't already given it away, then the opening sequence, set in 2003, spoilers it but big as death row inmate Marcus Wright (Worthington) signs a contract to have Cyberdyne have its way with his corpse. He does this in exchange for a kiss from Helena Bonham Carter, which would've been a cute moment except that it went by too abruptly. Cut then to the year 2018, and Judgment Day has happened. Everywhere lie the decay and ruins of civilization. The Machines have taken over. This isn't yet the time of John Connor. At this stage he is regarded by what's left of the human resistance as either savior or false prophet. At this stage John Connor is a respected and influential soldier in the Resistance, but, as the movie starts, he comes off as more or less still just one of the guys, just one of the soldiers, even if his peers know all about his perceived destiny. In 2018, John Connor ranks only second on Skynet's hit list.<br /><br />The person Skynet would most like to neutralize is a teenager named Kyle Reese, and even the casual fan is well aware that the Terminator mythos is very dependent on Kyle Reese. However, I don't get the logic in Reese being more crucial for Skynet to stop than John Connor. Connor doesn't know where Kyle is, but we learn that Kyle and a mute little girl comprise the entire Los Angeles-based resistance. Who knows how much longer these two could've waged their losing battle against Skynet's war machines, except that it's around here that Marcus Wright inexplicably resurfaces, asking what day and year it is and seemingly stunned at the rampant devastation stretching to the horizon. Marcus Wright's last memory is being executed in 2003 and his presence now in 2018 has already altered the time line. Elsewhere, John Connor tells his wife: "Something has changed. This is not the future my mother told me about." The only question is whether Marcus is someone from the past or something deployed from the future by Skynet. Either way, Marcus promptly proves to have exceptional survival skills.<br /><br />I liked this movie, liked enough about it that I don't really feel like slamming it too hard. The first two Terminator movies and even the SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES have built up enough good will that, even though I was a bit iffy about this fourth entry, I knew I was gonna be in the theater when it opened up. The story itself isn't all that and feels disjointed in spots. The core narrative follows Marcus Wright, but a key sub-plot involves the Resistance's discovery of a device which emits an override signal and renders the Machines inert. This kill switch is crucial to the Resistance's plan to take the fight directly to Skynet. This is pretty ho-hum stuff to me, and doesn't at all give me what I crave for, which is a series of absorbing character moments involving folks other than Marcus (Marcus has plenty of character moments).<br /><br />Thankfully, the incredibly intense action sequences and the special effects carry the movie, with the CG being wicked spectacular, seamless, really. And I dig the colossal Transforminator! Director McG and his crew really sell the harrowing, dirty, grainy future world and establish that palpable sense of bleakness, that man has lost his place as the dominant species on the planet. Sam Worthington is great, as mentioned, and never mind that his Australian accent peeks out every now and then. The film's emotional core absolutely revolves around the tragic Marcus Wright, and he brings home that central theme of "Do sad robots have souls?" You certainly connect with him more than with the grim and tortured John Connor, and going by the quality of Worthington's performance, AVATAR has got itself a crackling good lead. Anton Yelchin as the teenaged Kyle Reese does a good job of channeling Michael Bienh's mannerisms; he's sure more convincing playing Reese than he is playing Chekov. And to ***SPOILER*** the rest of this sentence, there's a serious fanboy moment when a certain T-800 makes an appearance.<br /><br />When that military defense program known as Skynet achieved self-awareness, who would've thunk it that several of its cyborgs (Marcus Wright & the T-800 from T2) would demonstrate more charisma and soulfulness than would the robotic Christian Bale as John Connor? And someone please tell the guy he's not on the Batman set anymore?<br /><br />TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES taps Kate Brewster as a key figure in the Resistance, except that, here, she does a lot of standing around, and it doesn't help that it's the lifeless Bryce Dallas Howard taking over that role (not that Claire Danes was any great shakes). Moon Bloodgood is sexy but superfluous, and, speaking as a dude, it's irksome that her nude scene was deleted. Absolutely, there's a jarring cut right around before the bandits attack Bloodgood's character, making it very apparent that a huge chunk of scene had been lopped off. The sense is that Bloodgood was supposed to provide a further emotional connection, and possibly even a romantic one, with Marcus. But all that is cut out. The Boy & His Robot theme is offered up again - between Kyle and Marcus, and between the little mute girl and Marcus - but it's not so convincing. And I resent the movie trying to manipulate us even more by introducing the "Newt" element.<br /><br />That old no-nonsense pro Michael Ironside, whom I remember best from the original V mini-series, comes in to provide some much needed fire as the current Resistance leader. So that's good.<br /><br />For someone touted as the savior of humanity, John Connor doesn't really do much until near the end, and so there's a credibility issue here. In the prior films, John Connor was either this shadowy figure lurking in the future or he was portrayed by unremarkable yahoos like Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl and that kid from the TV series. Meaning that, here we are somewhat caught up with the future time line and this is when and where John Connor is supposed to make his mark. He doesn't, and if Christian Bale hadn't insisted on expanding his John Connor role, word has it that the future messiah would've been relegated more to the background, maybe only as a raspy voice broadcasting over the radio, offering hope to the isolated pockets of survivors: "This is John Connor. If you are listening to this - you are the Resistance."<br /><br />And one beef I've always had - but it's minor - is the Terminators' habit of throwing their targets around, instead of just efficiently snapping necks. And - okay, I'm ***SPOILERING*** this sentence - - - when Connor infiltrates the heart of Skynet, he encounters only two Terminators. Two! So, okay, one is supposed to be the very first T-800 model; I guess that's why there's only one of his type. And the second is a T-600. But, dang, this is the heart of Skynet! Where's the rest of its soldiers?<br /><br />I miss Sarah Connor, her presence here relegated to voice recordings frequently consulted by John. But that's how good Linda Hamilton was.<br /><br />SALVATION presents us with a passel of Hunter-Killer war machines (the T-600, T-800, the hydrobot, the self-automated motorbikes, the Infiltration Prototype, etc.) but, probably because this is a PG-13 flick, the threat level isn't as impressive and these metal suckers aren't as frightening. And if you're expecting SALVATION to resolve everything, to provide a capper to the franchise, that doesn't happen. If anything, the hokey ending sets up a new trilogy. And as much as I've been grousing for the past few paragraphs, I'll say again that I like this movie. SALVATION is a gritty war movie as much as it is a sci-fi thriller. It certainly bears repeated viewings for the many very cool fan moments provided, although, okay, a young Kyle Reese doesn't quite pull off the iconic "Come with me if you want to live" line.<br /><br />In 2029, John Connor sends Kyle to 1984 to save Sarah Connor. This story being set in 2018, that's over a decade of stuff to chronicle. Yeah, man, this is gonna be another trilogy; it may even end up being a good one. John Connor still has a chance to convince us as that he IS one righteous mutha and that he's fated to lead humanity. But I still can't help but agree with Linda Hamilton; this thing should've ended with the first two films, with "No fate but what we make" still the relevant rallying cry. TERMINATOR: SALVATION gets 3.5 out of 5 stars from me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Are the monsters on the inside or outside?"></head><body><p>The Mist is an absolutely stunning horror movie. It has everything a monster movie should have such as suspense, panic, terror, madness with some powerful performances to boot. The premise is simple. A mist settles on a town and shoppers find themselves in a supermarket defending themselves from monsters that appear in the mist... and then having to defend themselves from each other. It leaves you asking the question "are the monsters on the inside or outside?"<br /><br />That dichotomy is what drives the film. It is very much about human behaviour under extreme duress in this survival horror as people doubt there are monsters and go outside, go outside anyway for a cause or to save somebody or a family member, start a cult inside that blames "unbelievers" or form separatist movements to plan an action of escape from the mystery mist that brings with it a wrath of monstrous proportions.<br /><br />The ending grabs you by the scruff of your neck and rattles you emotionally. It is the sort of ending you thought Hollywood never had the brass pair to make and yet when it comes you wish it hadn't. Not that the twist isn't good, it delivers a punch, but rips your heart out with it. Never has a film explored such dark realms as this has. You can't say in the end that you enjoyed the mist, but you can say that you lived through it. Unforgettably depressing but stylish and enduring, it is still a must see and daring brilliance.</p></body></html>

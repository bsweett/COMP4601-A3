<meta name="summary" content="Russell Crowe gives a heartwarming performance"></head><body><p>"Cinderella Man" is the story of a down-on-his-luck guy who makes an incredible boxing comeback and wins the world title during the Depression.  What sets this apart from other underdog boxing films is the endearing and passionate performance of Russell Crowe.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is utterly convincing as Jim Braddock; his face is craggy and lined, his tired eyes reflect desperation, fear, and hope.  He is as comfortable in the brutal boxing scenes as he is in the tender moments he shares with Renee Zellweger, who plays Jim's wife, Mae.  The sentimentality never becomes maudlin, and we come to like and admire Jim for the love he has for his family and his determination to do whatever he has to do to support them.<br /><br />Two scenes define Braddock even more than the boxing matches:  The first is when he is reduced to begging, hat in hand, from his former associates.  The second is when Jim goes to the relief office and repays the money he had been given.  These scenes show he was a man of intense pride and inner strength.  "Cinderella Man" is an inspiring movie!<br /><br />Kona</p></body></html>

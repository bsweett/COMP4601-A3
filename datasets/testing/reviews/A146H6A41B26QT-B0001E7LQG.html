Her goofiness, which seemed just goofy when young, is quite endearing in a 50-something woman. Nicholson is charming but I'm not sure I saw the "thing" that made ooddles of women fall for him. Frankly, Erica, I think you made a mistake--as a 50-something myself I'd have gone with the doctor any day!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another Jackass Movie"></head><body><p>Many people were swindled into signing a release before filming scenes that made them look stupid or foolish. If they did not have informed consent that contract may be null and void. A class action suit for defamation giving actual and punitive damages would put an end to these mock documentaries. Let them use real actors paid real wages to perform their script. Does this film have any redeeming social values? The impact of this film is how it measures popular taste. Barnum knew his public, and we may not be much different today.<br /><br />Does this film poke fun at stereotyped people? Does it have a political purpose in portraying ordinary people and taking advantage of them? Comedies of manners have always shown humor from the differences in expectations and reality ("Seinfeld", "Candid Camera"). "Borat" is like goading dumb animals to make them perform for a paying audience. Hours of filming ordinary people just to select the minutes where they can be made to look foolish and using a shill to guide the conversation and provoke comments is part of show business. You can see this on the "Tonight" show, or in past "Sixty Minutes". Its not likely on a live broadcast.<br /><br />Does the word "borat" have a meaning that can't be said on broadcast media? Consider this: "Mommy, Johnny made a B*R*T and its gross!"</p></body></html>

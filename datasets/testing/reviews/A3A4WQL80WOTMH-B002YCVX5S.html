The story is interesting and fun to follow and a lot of performances by unknown actors (to me at least) are better than that of the big names.  Pitt was fun at times, but didn't really cut it as a general - somehow he still seems too young and pop and I think even he was having a hard time believing his over the top accent.  While so many of the other actors in this World War II France put in believable top notch performances, I'd pop right out of the spell when Pitt and the gang came on though they occasionally added comic relief which may have been the point partly.  I agree with other reviews that call the Pitt factor a weak link in a film that almost could have been a masterpiece.  Still it's Tarrantino's style not to play it straight all the time, even amidst seriousness - the quirkiness that Pitt and his scalping crew brought to the movie sometimes did add an enjoyable fast food element.  And you know we love fast food but you don't confuse it for fine dining. This was a movie half sirloin, half hamburger - actually a formula that often produces success.  I just wonder how it would have been if they'd used different "hamburger".<br /><br />Good work by many actors, supporting and otherwise, the film was suspenseful, fairly clever and finally quite entertaining.  Some of the best performances in this movie came from those playing Nazis - like a good mafia movie, there's so much tension beneath the pleasantries.  Both leading ladies were good as well.  This is the first Tarantino film I've seen since Pulp Fiction that I've felt half enthused about. While not perfect, it had an element that has long been missing from his films - substantial story and interesting characters.</p></body></html>

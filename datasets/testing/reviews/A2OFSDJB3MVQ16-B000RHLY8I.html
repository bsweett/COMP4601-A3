<meta name="summary" content="Lord of War is HD DVD!!"></head><body><p>I checked to see if this film which I rented from Netflix in HD DVD was available on Amazon in that format and it isn't.  Too bad because this film is one of Nick Cage's better efforts. Produced by him as well, Cage has a great role as an Russian-American who discovers the way to wealth is thru selling arms.  Of course he doesn't figure the enormous cost it will eventually lead him to but that's one of the intriguing outcomes of this absorbing film. The narrative is done in the style of Scorsese's "Goodfellows" and is effective plus the supporting cast (Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Bridget Monihan) is excellent.  Anyway the transfer I saw in HD is excellent and I figure the same goes for the Blu-ray version of this film.  Recommended for Cage enthusiasts!!</p></body></html>

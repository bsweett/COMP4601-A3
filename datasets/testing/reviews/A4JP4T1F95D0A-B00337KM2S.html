<meta name="summary" content="Better than Expected"></head><body><p>My wife wanted to watch this film, so I rented it hoping for the best.  I have to say that I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.  A romantic comedy/drama this film kept me entertained throughout.  Clooney as charming as ever plays a corporate hatchet man who is traveling 240+ days a year and loves it.  He is not close to his sisters and has no family of his own.  It is a really interesting character study and the surrounding cast is very strong.  Some parts are a little cheesey, but enough works that I can recommend the movie.</p></body></html>

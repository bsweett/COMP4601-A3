<meta name="summary" content="Dystopian CGI"></head><body><p>I am Legend is an interesting sci-fi conceit - a vaccine to cure cancer goes horrifically wrong - a viral strain leads to the formation of human mutant grotesques who have attacked and eaten all the other humans on earth. Will Smith is the only survivor (this is all conveyed at face value in the first moments of the film, for viewers of truncated IQ, don't worry, you don't have to think too hard to work it out).<br /><br />Will Smith (aka Robert Neville, a scientist with military connections) is the only man left on a post human manhattan - overgrown with weeds, buildings falling into decay and blasted bridges (the Brooklyn Bridge, despite being a suspension bridge, only seems to have lost its middle span). Leaping deer and barking dogs roam around the island by day, more sinister creatures prevail at night (the post human mutants) so Neville has to sleep cradling a gun in his bath in his heavily fortified apartment with only Sam, his faithful German shepherd for company).<br /><br />Neville, despite being the only human around, still manages to pick up electricity and fresh water. (He also works out fanatically to keep his abs sharp, and doesn't let his hair grow long or grow a scruffy beard, despite that fact that there are no women left to justify all that grooming). He goes slightly nuts devoid of human company, talking to his dog, and broadcasting on the airwaves to see if anyone is around.<br /><br />The first moments of the film have some interesting scenes in the lab as Neville experiments on gollumesque GCI creatures to see if he can establish why the cancer cure went wrong, and how he can reverse the strain and keep human life going in the most unpromising of circumstances. Dangers and madness assail Neville each day. He befriends two mannequins in a DVD store, and is disturbed to discover they have moved outside the store one morning. He loses his beloved dog, Sam, after he is bitten by mutant dogs who are released after a snare trap disables Neville and has to put him down. His experiments to cure the mutant grotesques and restore human life constantly founder. He is constantly threatened by the grotesque creatures who have done for everyone else who attack him in all manner of ghoulish CGI ways. Through flashbacks it is revealed that his attempts to airlift his family out of Manhattan in the US exodus from Saigon type scenes failed, and his family have all perished, along with he presumes every other human on earth.<br /><br />Being Hollywood, light comes in (sadly around the same moment as the budget clearly runs out and the director realised the movie needs to wrap up in a swift conclusion having blown a cool $15 million on a Brooklyn Bridge scene).  Neville encounters other people who save him after an attack - a woman and her son who survived the disaster after being on an Brazilian Red Cross ship. Together, they work on an experiment to cure a mutant woman. This time it works, but Neville tragically perishes as the compound is attacked by CGIs). However he justifies his legend status by saving their lives to recreate humanity in the image of a Ronald Reagan wet dream - a beautiful clapboard village in tree dappled Vermont.</p></body></html>

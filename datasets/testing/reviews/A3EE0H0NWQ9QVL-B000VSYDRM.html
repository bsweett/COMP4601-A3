It methodically wraps a story around key players that both transcend and embrace class and sensual experience.  What strikes me throughout this film is how different it is from other movie outings.<br /><br />We start with a French baby who is born in Paris in the greatest of squalor.  His mother abandons him and lives him to rot on the streets.  She is caught and sent to the gallows, but his fate is to be sent to an orphanage where the children almost make a second attempt at the death penalty.  He's Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), and he soon discovers coming of age that he is different.  Not only is he a pariah, but he harbors a strong sense of smell that is only associated with animals.  It becomes clear that not only does it become his main sensory operandi to detect things and people, but, it is his last piece of dignity, so he lives his whole life wanting to preserve every smell he comes across on the planet.  Director Tom Tykwer makes every image stand out, so we can see, hear, and, well, almost smell, everything Jean-Baptiste does.  I felt my mind's filing cabinet filling in the blanks.  What they don't provide, we easily fill in the gaps, but what they do provide is an especially sensual visual and listening experience.  Much of 'Perfume...' is exquisite.  So if it is smell, like himself, he wishes to preserve, his highest pursuit will be for "the scent of a woman".  He can't rise above that in 18th century France until he comes upon a famed Italian perfumer living in Paris, Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman).  Delivering hides from a tannery not known for health benefits, Jean-Baptiste begs Baldini for a chance to work for him.  Here he can work on extra-curricular projects that will attempt to satisfy his olfactory palette for preserving every scent.  It's a tempestuous relationship at times, but it is Jean's portal to encountering wealthy women who wear the scents, like the one's Guiseppe is perveyor for.  In a tragic scene Jean-Baptiste encounters a woman, and, frightening her, he restrains her, so she won't cry out.  He is overly zealous and kills her inadvertently.<br /><br />After that the lingering fragrance of the movie is to trace and bottle the scent of a woman.  There's a scene where a red-haired woman is cutting apricots in two.  It is hallmark.  I was expecting an overflow of sexuality, but what I got was sensuality that was effective like few films are.  The rest of the movie takes many turns; many of which I didn't expect.  I am still pondering the repurcussions of this film.  The only film I can think of that remotely reminds me of 'Perfume' is 'Chocolat'.  It is an odd and unique bird.  While I am satisfied with the lingering effects of 'Perfume,' it isn't all neat and tidy.  Perhaps that's what makes it so rare and special...The film I mean.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Did this out do the 1st movie I think so 8/10 part 2 on X Men collection X Men/X2 DVD reviews"></head><body><p>X2 was a 2003 movie it was a follow up to X Men I think they succeeded with a better movie the cast from the 1st movie comes back Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stuart, Ian McKellen Famke Janssen, Halle Berry dropped out of Gili to reprise her role smart lady lol. 2 newer characters are Nightcrawler played by Allen Cumming Colonel Willam Stryker played by Brian Cox. Plot is Nightcrawler goes to the White House tears @** through secret service gives the President a message Mutant Freedom. Professor X fearing a war has Jean Grey & Storm go to Boston & get Nightcrawler. Professor X is captured later on by Colonel Willam Stryker & Cyclops was captured too & is being "reeducted" by Stryker. Stryker also stages an assault on the on the Mansion. Magneto gets involved & heroes & villains team up. Stryker is using the Professor to kill every human on Earth Magneto has his own agenda. They definitely intended on a 3rd part cause Jean Grey sacrifices herself at the end.</p></body></html>

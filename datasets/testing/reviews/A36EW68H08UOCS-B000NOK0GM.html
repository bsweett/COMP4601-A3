<meta name="summary" content="One of the World's Greatest Movies"></head><body><p>Carol Reed directed Graham Greene's script and the result is the sort of film that still shows up on "greatest movie" lists 50 years later.<br /><br />Joseph Cotten plays Holly Martin, an American who writes pulpy Westerns. Holly has come to Vienna just at the end of World War II to visit his old friend, Harry Lime. He arrives just in time to hear about Harry's funeral.  Vienna is a city full of rubble and debris from bombing.  It has been divided up into four sectors governed by Americans, British, French and Russians.  The black market fluorishes.<br /><br />Holly discovers Harry's girlfriend, Anna, played by the enigmatic Valli, and he discovers that Harry was one of the dirtiest and most opportunistic of the black marketeers.<br /><br />Harry Lime is played by Orson Welles, and the part has as much "bang for the buck" as any in cinematic history.  In the accompanying documentary Peter Bogdonovich recalls speaking with Orson Welles and remarking that Harry Lime was one of the great parts of cinematic history.<br /><br />"Oh, yes", Welles said.  "It's a great Mr. Wu part."<br /><br />"Mr. Wu?" Bogdonovich asked.<br /><br />"Yes, you know - 'you'd better watch out for Mr. Wu.... did you run that by Mr. Wu? Then at the end of the first act you see Mr. Wu in silhouette far away standing on a bridge.  By the time 'Mr. Wu' actually shows up in the film his stature has become so built up in the minds of the audience he is MUCH bigger than life."<br /><br />Harry Lime is one of those characters.  This is one of those movies.  The further the story progresses the more layers of deceit and wrongdoing are uncovered.  Feelings are hurt, hearts are broken, innocents are hurt and killed.<br /><br />This film has several of the most famous scenes of movie history.  Roger Ebert writes that the appearance of Harry Lime is the most famous entrance in cinema.  The ending surprised even the actors.  The "cuckoo clock" speech is said to have been improvised by Welles, and it's difficult to think that anything written by Graham Greene could have been improved, but it's impossible to think of the film without this speech.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it - dive right in.  Go with Holly Martin and Anton Karas' famous zither score.  Fall in love with Anna.  Smile with Harry and take your choice - War and Da Vinci or Peace and the Cuckoo Clock?</p></body></html>

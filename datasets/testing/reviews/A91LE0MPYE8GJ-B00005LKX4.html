I now own the, DVD great featres Deleted Scences and the Alternate Ending was good. Some parts were sick, which I won't mention but I liked this if you haven't seen The Silence Of The Lambs I suggest you watch it first to understand the story. Goodie Goodie! Well overall I liked, it scary so buy or rent this.</p></body></html>

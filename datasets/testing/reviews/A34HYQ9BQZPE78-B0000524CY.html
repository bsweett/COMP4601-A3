<meta name="summary" content="The scariest movie ever, reviewed on the scariest night of the year"></head><body><p>Well, considering it's Halloween night and this is the last of my "31 Reviews For 31 Days of October" review-fest, I figure I'll end this countdown with one of the absolute most well-known horror movies of all time, and certainly one of the most horrifying, "The Exorcist". Although many quotes, stunts and ideas from this movies have been taken and parodied ("The power of Christ compels!" comes to mind.), this movie nevertheless has the power and terror that basically defines the horror movie genre.<br /><br />Watching "The Exorcist" all the way through is more like an experience than watching a movie. For one thing, the general idea of the movie is a plausible concept, and having been to a paranormal speaker just last night, who ironically spoke of and showed a video of an exorcism for which she witnessed, this sort of thing is not entirely impossible, although it almost never happens. I don't want to dwindle on this part too much, but also regarding that I'm Roman Catholic, this movie definitely hits home with me.<br /><br />But back to the movie itself. It kicks off with a scene that takes place in Egypt if I'm not mistaken, on an excavation dig with the foreign scenery setting a mood and atmosphere that carries throughout the whole movie. Starting the movie like this is an interesting idea, and a concept that hasn't been done too much by other movies, even though it works here. The acting throughout is phenomenal, alongside the special effects, which goes without saying. The whole movie plays out like a terrifying, dark, atmospheric nightmare and never loses its intensity or interest, even in the slower moments. I must say, even though I personally sometimes find it tedious to sit through a movie that goes over two hours long, I think "The Exorcist" definitely has the hudspah (spelling?) to make it pull you in for the whole thing. As dark and terrifying as this movie is, it most certainly still packs a brilliance, alongside talented writing and directing that makes it worth the watch.<br /><br />In short, "The Exorcist" is a film that's just as horrifying as it is both groundbreaking and vastly interesting. Such a movie deserves to go down as one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and considering I'm a guy who's seen countless horror movies, I agree with that statement. Well, the review's about up, but for those that haven't seen such a heart-pounding, groundbreaking, interest-stirring movie yet, this is very highly recommended. And before you sleep, say some prayers just for safety!!! Happy Halloween, everybody, I'm off to smother myself in Halloween candies, household props and going around all evening in my pajama pants. Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

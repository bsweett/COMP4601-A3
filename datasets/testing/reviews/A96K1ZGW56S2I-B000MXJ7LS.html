There are hundreds of millions of stories about that day that could be told.  WORLD TRADE CENTER is a film that attempts to tell the story of that day seen through the eyes of two Port Authorities who became trapped in the rubble beneath the World Trade Center and who were eventually rescued.  The two men the movie revolves around, John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and William J. Jimeno (Michael Pena), had entered the World Trade Center to assist firefighters and other law enforcement in evacuating the buildings.  As things turned out it became they who needed to be rescued as the buildings came crashing down.  The story of their survival and rescue is just a glimpse of the heroism showed by countless Americans that was displayed on September 11th and in the aftermath.<br /><br />WORLD TRADE CENTER is probably Oliver Stone's most approachable and least controversial film ever.  The film has broad appeal, not only to those who lived and worked in New York City, but across America.  As alluded to before, every one of us has a story about September 11th.  The film just focuses on two men, but by doing so it becomes universal:  the story of John McLoughlin and William J. Jimeno are all our stories.  We might not have all been physically present in NYC when the towers fell, but we watched it on television.  That was a day that there were no divisions in this country.  Strangers willingly helped strangers and at least for once in a generation, we were all simply Americans.  WORLD TRADE CENTER depicts this and it does so it a non-patronizing, yet honorable way.<br /><br />I was a bit leery about watching WORLD TRADE CENTER.  Granted, Oliver Stone is a gifted filmmaker.  However, most of Stone's films are extreme.  In general the Stone canon is comprised of films that offer a bleak and despairing view of people and life.  Often his movies are quite violent, crude, and vulgar.  He is able to craft together a decent story from the most unusual sources and he has a master command of camera technique and cinematography.  However, the nihilistic tone of many of Stone's previous works made me reluctant to watch.  After my family and some friends had seen the film and recommended it, I was willing to give it a try.  I'm glad that I did.  Whatever messages Stone has tried to convey in previous films and films yet to come, WORLD TRADE CENTER Stone reminds us that we are all Americans, even himself, and that even in a messed up crazy world hope still remains.</p></body></html>

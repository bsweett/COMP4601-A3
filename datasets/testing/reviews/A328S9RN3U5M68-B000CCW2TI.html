<meta name="summary" content="A Tense, Fast Paced Thriller"></head><body><p>Who would expect a screenplay/story by Carl Ellsworth ('Buffy the Vampire Slayer') directed by horror master Wes Craven to be an intelligent thriller?  Yet RED EYE is precisely that.  This a tight conversational duet for two actors with accompaniment that slips up on the viewer so surely that the terrifying climax is somewhat of a relief from the preceding tension.<br /><br />Rachael McAdams as the heroine proves she can sustain a fine character development from first appearance through the suspense to the last screen frame.  Likewise, Cillian Murphy uses not only his talent as an actor but also his clear blue-eyed innocence to foreshadow the evil underneath.  Since the majority of the film takes place aboard an airplane in flight (the red eye from Texas to Miami), the tension for the story rests heavily with these two actors.  They succeed in every way, as does Craven in turning his directorial skills to intellectual rather than physical terror.  Well done! Grady Harp, January 06</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray: A Five Star Release - PQ, AQ, Special Features - Fantastic!"></head><body><p>"Toy Story", the film that would earn animation company Pixar Animation Studios the reputation of being the finest animation studio in the world and would literally bring Walt Disney Studios to enter new generation of animated films created entirely in CGI but also would earn the love and praise not only from the critics but the fans who wanted more and more.<br /><br />Released in 1995 and budgeted at $30 million, the first film would go on to make $351 million worldwide (and still making money with the recent Blu-ray release).<br /><br />In November 1999, the sequel "Toy Story 2" was released in theaters and the $90 million dollar film like its predecessor did extremely well in the domestic and worldwide box office making over $485 million.<br /><br />But it has been more than a decade since the release of a "Toy Story" film and 15 years since the first film, fans have been clamoring for a new "Toy Story" film and sure enough, Disney/Pixar released the third and final film of the trilogy, "Toy Story 3" in June 2010 and not only did it surpass the box office returns of the first two films combined, earning over 1 billion dollars, the second Disney film to earn over a billion after "Alice in Wonderland" (also released in 2010).<br /><br />"Toy Story 3" literally shattered box office records and became the 5th highest grossing film of all time worldwide and the 9th highest grossing film in the US (and obviously the highest grossing film of 2010) and is an ultimate success for Disney/Pixar.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />When I watched "Toy Story 1" and "Toy Story 2", I easily noticed how CGI had improved between 1995 and 1999, especially with how fabric started to show more detail and we started to see more of a surface to Mr. Potato Head and T-Rex.<br /><br />But "Toy Story 3", eleven years later, you would expect CGI to take a dramatic leap forward and needless to say, "Toy Story 3" is visually impressive.<br /><br />Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio), the first thing you notice with "Toy Story 3" are the vibrant colors and then overall detail.  Everything shows detail and as we learn from this Blu-ray release, the animators wanted to make sure that the characters themselves do not look like toys, that they wanted to make sure the characters and toys are distinguished and the animators succeeded in every way possible.<br /><br />Mr. Potato Head, you literally see the surface like the actual toy, down to its seams.  Look at the hardwood floors in Andy's room, so much detail on the floor that it looks realistic, even some outdoor scenes look photorealistic (especially the animation and CG shown during Lotso's past, wow!).  And the fabric of the clothing, you can see the threading, the weaves and how much detail went into the clothing. One scene with the monkey, it looks like a stuffed monkey with its detail, the detail of it's clothing and scary eyes, these models look fantastic!  Also, see the dirt and grime on the animals, that was awesome how they captured that in the film.<br /><br />The hair even was well-done, the wear and tear that the toys go through at Sunnyside Daycare is evident through the nicks and scratches and also looking at Andy's trunk and seeing the little chips on the trunk to the paint and we can see the brush strokes on the walls, "Toy Story 3" just looks magnificent on Blu-ray and I don't see how any videophile can say anything negative about how this film looks on Blu-ray.<br /><br />And facial expressions of the human characters such as Andy, his sister, his mother to Bonnie, these were well-animated and rendered.<br /><br />I did notice some banding but times I did see it were short.  For example, when Woody is back at Sunnyside, he is holding the red phone receiver and the banding is evident in that one scene but again, the scenes you do see it are seconds long and does not distract you from how fantastic this film looks.<br /><br />This is the best looking Disney/Pixar film to date!  Vibrant, detailed and everything about the picture quality is going to make videophiles swoon!  It's that impressive and easily a reference quality Blu-ray release for picture quality!<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1).<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"Toy Story 3 " is presented in English 7.1 DTS Master Audio and English 5.1 DTS Master Audio.  Also, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital EX is included as well as English 2.0 DVS.<br /><br />All I can say is that "Toy Story 3' sounds magnificent.  The first action scenes that startoff the film will show you how awesome this film sounds in lossless.  From Mrs. Potato Head's voice coming from the surround channels, sounds coming from the rear surround channels, LFE being utilized for the evil Dr. Porkchop's laser beam or when Mr. Potato Head has Slinky Dog turn on its force field and Jesse calling on T-Rex, this is just impressive to hear the sound coming from all channels.<br /><br />Dialogue is crystal clear and music is just as clear!  And you then hear how the sound is utilized during the children's rush to get the toys as they slam them all over the place, the garbage dump as everything is being compacted and you can hear flames pattering, the garbage truck coming from the distance, tiny footstep sounds throughout the room... really, there are so many sounds that are well-utilized throughout this film, it's very impressive!  Sure, the film is not 100% action-based but action and non-action scenes, the film sounds fantastic on Blu-ray and I didn't even notice a lot of these sounds at the theater when I watched this film this past summer.<br /><br />So, you really experience a  great, immersive soundscape with "Toy Story 3' from all channels, especially via LFE. Not only is picture quality hitting the high marks for reference quality, the lossless audio is just as magnificent and audiophiles should be happy with this Blu-ray release as well!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.  For the special features, some extras have other subtitles included.<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital EX and 2.0 DVS.

Also, a slip over cover comes with this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I'm sure that "Toy Story 3" hit people a lot harder emotionally than some viewers.  Some look at it as the next level of wonderful CGI graphics for Disney/Pixar animated films, others look at the film as another successful film for the studio but I'm going to go even farther and say that this film caught my attention, not because I grew up with the previous two films but the fact is that like the character of Andy, during my late teens, it was time to say goodbye to all the toys that I once owned.<br /><br />Memories of having friends overnight to play with these toys, memories of opening the old department store catalogs and hoping my grandparents would get me the latest toy that I picked out and then to open it in Christmas morning.  Suffice to say, when it came to my toys... I was very fortunate to have such a memorable time playing with them and having caring family to help support that habit.  But unlike Andy, I did not have the moment to say goodbye, it was more like, turn 16 and my parents made the conscious decision to throw out all my toys and force me to sell all my comic books and prepare for graduation and SAT tests and so forth.<br /><br />Needless to say, it was not necessarily a traumatic moment but it was a defining moment...OK, who am I kidding, it was one of the saddest moments in my life.<br /><br />So, "Toy Story 3" for me, was just a magnificent film that took me back to those old days of playing in my room and like Andy, having these wild adventures that I could conjure in my head and sooner or later, we grow older, become interested in different things and sooner or later, we say goodbye and prepare for our next stage in our lives as young adults.<br /><br />I watched this film knowing that it was going to be successful and along with my wife, my son and my nephew, watched it in 3D the first day it came to theater.  But watching it on Blu-ray, without the usual audience distractions, my experience this time around was heightened.  Watching "Toy Story 3" in 1080p, I was amazed by how vibrant the film looked, how much detail was showcased.  From the little tears in Andy's toy chest, the clothing of the characters, the dirt and grime on the toys, the wonderful lossless audio and then for me to watch the special features in three days because there are a good number of them included, I can't help but feel that this is truly a perfect release.<br /><br />Yes, I am sure the videophiles will say there was banding on the picture quality but those banding moments were few and were short.  Really, everything you love about the film, you get that and more in the "Toy Story 3: 4-Disc Combo Pack". It's important for people to know that if you don't need the accompanying DVD or the digital copy, you can also purchase the Blu-ray two-disc version as well.<br /><br />Personally, I can't find one significant flaw with this Blu-ray release.  There is something for everyone in this release, may you be a fan of the film, a person wanting to learn about the animation business and learn from the awesome team at Pixar, there is just so much to love about this release that it's definitely one of the top 10 Blu-ray releases of 2010 and that is pretty tough as this year alone had many significant releases, especially coming from Disney.  If anything, Walt Disney continues to raise the bar for its Blu-ray releases and I suppose since this is finale farewell for the "Toy Story" series (which I would imagine is not set in stone because "Toy Story" made an insane amount of money for Disney and "Toy Story 3" made over a billion dollars worldwide, I just can't see this being a 100% final farewell), they had to go out with a bang for this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, "Toy Story 3" is a film in which Pixar continues to their reign of innovation, their mark on quality of beautifully animated films and a well-written storyline that just pulls you in.  The Blu-ray release is not just for those who love "Toy Story 3" but for those who loved the "Toy Story" trilogy.  If you loved the first two films, then this is a no-brainer, this is a must-buy release.<br /><br />"Toy Story 3: 4-Disc Combo Pack" is magnificent and is a true 5-star release!  Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Much better than the original!"></head><body><p>Finally someone in Hollywood has realized that re-making a great movie never works; try updating a dud instead. And Ocean's Eleven was a dud....self-indulgent and lifeless, it seemed to exist just so the Rat-Pack could get paid to hang out together.<p>  So here comes the remake. I have to admit that I wasn't interested in seeing it, but the good reviews made me take a chance. And I loved it! Steven Soderbergh's film just zips along, and is fun the whole way through. I had a smile on my face from beginning to end. <p>  Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) has just been released from prison, and is barely out the door before he's getting a crew together and plotting an audacious heist that, if successful, could net his 11-man team a cool $160 Million. The team is comprised of, among others, Matt Damon, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Scott Caan, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, and Brad Pitt. (Pitt is especially good as Clooney's unflappable sidekick; I thought he stole the film away from Clooney.) Andy Garcia is the cold-as-ice Casino owner; he makes a great villain. It's funny how the movie gets us to root FOR the bad guys (the theives), and boo the person who, in any other situation, would have our sympathy. Very well done, indeed.<p> If I loved the movie that much, why only 4 stars? 2 words: JULIA ROBERTS. I don't like her. The movie grinds to a halt whenever she's onscreen. I found her character to be a pointless distraction, and she serves no point in the film, other than as Marquee value. And her mouth is HUGE!!!! Her lips look like two raw clams are stuck to her mouth.......(Sorry, but I just don't like her....)<p>  Aside from Julia, Ocean's Eleven is a great way to pass a few hours.</p></body></html>

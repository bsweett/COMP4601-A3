The best line in the whole movie was "You can check out but never leave the room! If you would like to try our express check out (a noose appears in all of the rooms)please let us know." John Cusack's acting is his usual but the script lacked something worth acting for. Don't expect to see Samuel L. Jackson for more than five minutes!</p></body></html>

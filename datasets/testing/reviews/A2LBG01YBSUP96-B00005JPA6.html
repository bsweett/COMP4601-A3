<meta name="summary" content="PURE PERFECTION"></head><body><p>this is everything the devils backbone wanted to be.while that movie had the feel of that period,it wasnt a horror movie at all.what it was was a look at a great director,storyteller in the making.<br /><br />the departed won the big awards but it wasnt the best movie.i cant see giving a redo (as great as the departed was/is) such high acclaim when theres such an original movie just as good.del toro got robbed.case closed.<br /><br />we all know what the story is about and its a hard sell in hollywood in the sense of it being accepted (not the most child-friendly telling of a childs fantasy,is it) so i wont rehash.<br /><br />del toro or his reps....GET IN THE DIRECTORS CHAIR SOON !!!!!<br /><br />(no more ''backbone's'' though,ok?????)</p></body></html>

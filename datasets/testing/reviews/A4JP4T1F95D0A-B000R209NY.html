Outside of the effects, the movie is just okay.  It follows the same basic concept of the original Poseidon adventure and updates it with new characters.  The idea is the same however with a few survivors trying to make it to the top which was the bottom of the ship to escape.  Russell is convincing in his role, with a stellar name cast mostly just okay and working with what is given to them.  If you love The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact, then this is the film for you.  Otherwise, wait for it to hit dvd.</p></body></html>

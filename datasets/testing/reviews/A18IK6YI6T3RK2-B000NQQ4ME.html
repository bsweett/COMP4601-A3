Let me be frank, the film is brutally violent and as is de rigure for Gibson films the  is up close and personal, Gibson seems to love graphic  and savagry, but it actually works in this film.  The story is simple, but engrossing and you really find yourself rooting for the protagonist as he races against the clock.  The acting is actually quite good and the direction and cinemaphotograpy first rate.  I highly recommend it, its a very good piece of filmmaking, but it is hella violent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An eighty minute thrill ride"></head><body><p>&quot;Phone Booth&quot; throws you as the viewer into a terrifying yet realistic situation, scares the life out of you, and then leaves you just as quickly to recover.  It is smart, entertaining, even funny at times, but not dull at all.  It features only three real performances, one of which has only about two minutes of screen time.<p>Colin Farrell plays a publicity agent who is all lies and double talk.  He spends the first few minutes wheeling and dealing on his cell phone trying to line up appointments for his clients, all of whom believe he is the real deal.  He has certainly presented himself that way.  He then goes into a phone booth to call his &quot;mistress&quot; (he hopes).  He uses the booth so the call can't be traced on the cell phone and his wife won't see it.<p>After the call, the phone rings and he answers it, beginning one of the most frightening experiences you will witness.  He is basically held hostage by the caller on the phone, who has done his homework and knows what a liar Ferrell is.  The caller (Kiefer Sutherland) intends to get a confession out of him and teach him a lesson.  Eventually the cops show up to straighten things out and the main officer (Forest Whitaker) starts to see that Ferrell is not totally in control.<p>By the end, I was exhausted by the ride.  The ending is not a happy one, but it makes sense and goes along with the story as told.  All in all, this is one powerful 80 minute film.</p></body></html>

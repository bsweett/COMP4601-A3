<meta name="summary" content="Rooney Mara Oscar Nominated... movie no better or worse than the original"></head><body><p>At the time of his death, Swedish author Stieg Larsson was sitting on a trilogy of unpublished novels called the "Millenium Series".  His life ended before he was able to see his trilogy about an unorthodox ward of the state surveillance agent named Lisbeth Salander, take off into an international sensation. His novels became best sellers, in 2009 the first of his trilogies was made into a Swedish film called "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" and was consequently followed up with two more films, and now the movie has been adapted into an English language film, directed by David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club, The Social Network).<br /><br />Salander, (Rooney Mara) otherwise, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, has led an abusive life and after her legal guardian suffers a stroke, she is legally assigned to a new guardian, who uses his position and her money as a tool to abuse her even more. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is hard hitting and offensive at times, but such is the beauty of Larsson's writings. We would all like to believe that violence and abuse doesn't exist, but the truth is we choose to ignore it, brush it under the rug and pretend it doesn't.  This is the very theme that resides throughout Larsson's "Millenium Series" and throughout "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".<br /><br />The majority of the movie centers on a 40-year old murder mystery and a fourteen-year old girl who vanished from a prominent family without explanation. Mikael Blomkvist, (Daniel Craig) a magazine publisher, is hired to investigate the crime. Through a course of events, he and Salander become partners into a rich and complicated mystery.<br />As someone who has seen all of the Swedish films and can give an opinion about the English language version, based on the original, David Fincher has added much to the film. The movie appears to be more in depth and shows more of Lisbeth's character changing throughout. Her harshness softness as the movie goes along and Fincher has chosen to emphasis that more. The movie can feel wordy and long, but during that time, the information and investigation is thoroughly interesting and challenging.<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a breakout film for Rooney Mara, just as it was for Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes 2), who played the title character in the original release. She fought hard for the part and she does it justice. She wears the scars of a troubled past like a glove and is able to shed those things when it is necessary.<br /><br />I can't say that the new version is better than the original or worse. The truth is, they are both great films because of the subject matter, the richness of the characters and the writing. The new film will certainly bring a larger audience to an already popular series of movies worldwide. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" will most certainly be one that will be mentioned on Oscar night, if only for just Rooney Mara.</p></body></html>

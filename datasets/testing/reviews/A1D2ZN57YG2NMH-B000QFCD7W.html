<meta name="summary" content="Funny Movie... Offensive Content"></head><body><p>So, granted, this film is pretty funny. The cast is great, the story is fun, the director did a good job, and the various skits and funny scenes are very funny. So, usually, this is a cut and dry four star for me, but I really need to dock a star from this film because of the constant language, gay innuendo, and sexual humor. I really wish this film had been done more tastefully, because it could have been awesome.</p></body></html>

The Bourne Supremacy stands on its own as a pretty good, self-contained espionage thriller. There are some real improvements in this episode - the pacing is faster, the action sequences are more frenetic, and the ending is stronger and much more credible.  The Bourne Supremacy continues the adventures of amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) as he tries to elude, and outthink a rather disorganized CIA, who created him and now want him dead.<br /><br />The disenchanted Jason Bourne is living in Goa, India with girlfriend, Maria (Franka Potente), but he is plagued by violent nightmares of a double assassination, and he is troubled by the role he might have played in it.  Meanwhile in Berlin, the CIA led by Pamela Landry (Joan Allen), is participating in some sort if sting operation, that is designed to net a mole. However, things go terribly wrong when the mole is killed, and a Russian petroleum oligarch frames Bourne for the murder-robbery. With Bourne suddenly reappearing, his old agency, led by Landry and the duplicitous Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) launch an intercontinental manhunt to hunt Bourne down. Bourne, always one step ahead of his adversaries, launches a one-man counter attack against his enemies.<br /><br />Bourne can never be sure who the enemy is, as the CIA and the Russian secret service are both out to get him, and not only is Bourne's memory fractured, but certain members of the CIA are surreptitiously working undercover with the corrupt Russian oil oligarchs to bring Bourne down. Bourne's old medical officer Nicky, (the beautiful Julia Stiles) and sympathetic agent Danny Zorn (Gabriel Mann), both make return appearances, and provide a link to the first movie.<br /><br />The film is somewhat overly plotted and the back-story convoluted, so at times, it's hard to figure out actually what is going on, and what relation some of the minor key players have to the story. But the overall direction of the film is so good and Matt Damon's performance so strong that the film races along with a realistically sustained tension and atmosphere. Towards the end of the movie the handheld camera work, which at first, gives the action a jittery immediacy, does become a little tiresome, particularly during a ferocious high-speed pursuit through Moscow.<br /><br />Matt Damon is made to play Jason Bourne; this is easily his best performance in years, and his hunky, boyish, sexiness brings an understated introspectiveness along with a real emotional vulnerability to the role. The supporting players are also strong: Julia Styles brings intelligence and susceptibility, while Joan Allan is deeply cautious, focused and watchful. So much of the action takes place in Europe and Russia, that the viewer will be dazzled by the different locales. The Bourne Supremacy is a good, strong, espionage thriller, that will leave you waiting in anticipation for the next installment where Jason Bourne will continue his quest for his lost identity.

The movie portrays a young couple who are stuck in a rut and decide at one point to make a major change in their lives and move from Connecticut to Paris. This sounds all well and good, but then various new options and obstacles begin to mount. He's offered a better paying job, and she gets pregnant, and so instead of being able to make a break for a new life the prison of their lives begins to get tighter. It is apparent early on that April is unhappy with her life. On the other hand Frank seems resigned to his vacuous life. April is frustrated with their lives and grows resentful of Frank's complacency. There is a chilling scene, the morning after their big argument, when Frank comes to breakfast. April acts like one of the Stepford wifes, behaving with utmost perfection, like a dutiful wife, as if nothing ever happened the night before. Frank seems bewildered, but relieved, and doesn't seem to think too much about what his wife's chilling transformation could mean.<br /><br />Sam Mendes (Road to Perdition, American Beauty) beautifully directs this movie, which initially seems trapped in the inertia of its all too idealized depiction of 1950's America, but then Mendes takes us down this disturbing path where everything that is too perfect, sterile and bland is revealed as a kind of prison for this couple, and this facilitates in highlighting the underlining tension between Frank and April. This is a monumental movie that takes its time in order to weave it web.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="How Grimm indeed!"></head><body><p>This movie is a really dark mess; total waste of time.<br />I once read a bio of the real Bros Grimm which said they were linguists who collectored the stories told by persons they encountered while traveling for research.  Many European tales are scary indeed, but we have the brothers to thank for preserving the folk heritage.<br />Too bad they didn't make a film about the real story.  Maybe someone will yet.</p></body></html>

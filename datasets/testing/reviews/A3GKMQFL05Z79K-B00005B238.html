<meta name="summary" content="Predator......"></head><body><p>Predator is a 1987 american science fiction action film that tells the story of an special forces team, led by 'Dutch' (Arnold Schwarzenegger), on a mission to rescue hostages from guerrilla territory in Central America. During their mission, though, they are hunted by an extraterrestrial lifeform known as the Predator.<br /><br />Originally titled Hunter, Predator was met with mixed reactions from movie reviewers and fans of Schwarzenegger. As time wore on, though, people warmed up to the film and is actually considered one of Schwarzenegger's best films in his career. A little known fact that has circulated around the net is that Jean Claude Van-Damme was cast as the Predator in the beginning but, was replaced by Kevin Peter Hall, because of his reservations with the movie.</p></body></html>

Much to my interest, "The Director's Cut" came my way. Curiously, some "Director's Cuts" are just a few sunsets added, along with 5 or 10 minutes of some guy riding a horse across admittedly spectacular scenery. Happily, this is not one of them.<br /><br />The added material in fact gives a lot more to the plot, and I agree with Ridley Scott that some of it should never have been removed. The subplot about Sybilla's son added more to the political intrigues, which I felt made the movie much better, giving it more substance. In short, the Director's Cut was much more interesting to me than the original release.<br /><br />The characterisations and the depth they receive with the added material also make a richer and more rewarding movie. In some parts, Orlando Bloom seems a little contrived, but overall the acting is first class, to match the first class cast.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD package in all respects. Honestly, I would be surprised if anyone finds it inferior to the shorter versions of the film. It is very thorough in all respects, including the supporting materials on the other 2 discs. This is an excellent movie version and the package is well worth getting.</p></body></html>

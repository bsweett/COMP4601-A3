So the notion of bringing the Wolf Man back to the screen is near and dear to my heart.<br /><br />This version is actually a new incarnation of the classic Wolf Man movie of 1941 from Universal Studios, which in turn was preceded by Werewolf of London. The new version incorporates elements from both movies. From Werewolf London, we get the origin of the werewolf originating in Tibet, dueling werewolves, and death by gun.  From the Wolf Man we get the Talbot family line, the "wolfbane" poem, and the silver wolf-headed walking stick.  Perhaps the biggest inspiration is the makeup itself, which eschews the now standard gorilla-werewolf transformation for a form that looks distinctly like the original Wolf Man makeup.<br /><br />Shakespearian actor and American Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Toro) returns to his family manor after a long separation at the bequest of his dead brother's fianc&eacute; Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt). Conliffe is central to the plot; she enamors Lawrence as well as his father, Sir John (Anthony Hopkins), and it is her presence or lack thereof that drives the lycanthropes to murder. As the body count rises, Francis Aberline of Scotland Yard (Hugo Weaving) arrives to solve the mystery.  The hunt is on, but who's hunting whom?<br /><br />Benicio del Toro is undeniably wolfish-looking, but he seems wooden and out of his element compared to Blunt, who uses her big soulful eyes and gothic Victorian attire to good effect.  Unfortunately, they lack chemistry.  More imposing but erratic is Hopkins, who lends a cold menace to the cast.  Weaving doesn't have much to do but glare and shout orders, but then that's what we're accustomed to by now.  He does add "horrified stare" to his trademarked expression.<br /><br />Interspersed throughout the mystery is the family rivalry between sons and father.  The best part of the movie takes place in an insane asylum. It provides an ironic take on lycanthropy as a mental disease and contrasts Victorian logic with the lurking world of magic and curses.<br /><br />The Wolfman stays true to its roots.  This is not a remake as much as it is a reimagining, filled with lush backdrops, gloomy settings, ancient moors, and a Tim Burton soundtrack that pays homage to Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula.  This incarnation is a gothic period piece set in Victorian times<br /><br />Unfortunately, you get the sense that this new version is very insecure about its choices. The movie isn't particularly scary -- the horror is meant to be from the doomed plight of the protagonist -- but it nevertheless resorts to random shrieks and jump cuts.  The Wolfman, while undeniably violent, transforms into an over-the-top death machine capable of tearing off heads and limbs with one swipe of his claws. This isn't just a new version of the Wolf Man, it's the Wolf Man on steroids.<br /><br />Like Dracula, The Wolfman does not end well for any of its characters.  As a gothic romance the best we can hope for is a resolution, not a happy ending.  And that's exactly how it should be. The Wolfman respectfully carries a legacy of violent beasts on its hirsute shoulders, but mainstream audiences will probably hate it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Last King of Scotland"></head><body><p>This is the much lauded film about Idi Amin and his rise to power, his tenuous grip on his advisers and his own sense of reality and his relationship with his personal physician. It is infused with his paranoia and maniacal flips from joviality to aggression. Forrest Whittaker and Jame McAvoy play their roles superbly and Gillian Anderson is excellent, but sadly underused as an actress. This film is rich and colourful and shows to some extent what life may have been like in Seventies Uganda. I found it to be perfectly watchable and the acting impressive, but I wasn't as engrossed or engaged as I'd been lead to believe I would be (hence the 4 stars). But this is a good story, directed well, with a great African soundtrack. Well worth a viewing for a look at a ruthless dictator.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

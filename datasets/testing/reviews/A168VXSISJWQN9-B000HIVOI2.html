<meta name="summary" content="A movie of two parts"></head><body><p>I came to this movie rather late and I haven't watched the TV series. However, I do enjoy science fiction when it's well done so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />The first part was just fine. It was reminiscent of 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind', from which it clearly borrowed a couple of ideas. The main characters were well-established, the concept was intriguing and the special effects were realistic enough to allow disbelief to be suspended. Once the voyagers got to the other end of the stargate, the world they found was both inhospitable yet somewhat familiar, enough to make the concept of humans being relocated there not altogether implausible.<br /><br />The problem is that from there the movie changed. Suddenly the quality of writing and the plot twists dropped to those of a 1950s B-movie. So many cliches were included- the mysterious woman from another planet with whom the hero falls in love, the young rebel reminding the grieving military father of his dead son, the brave peasants revolting against the infinitely superior weapons of the slave masters. Most of all, the cheesy faux-Egyptian villains, totally unbelievable despite a deliciously creepy performance from Jaye Davidson. The fights were hokey and badly staged and although the climax was well-realized, by that time I'd ceased to care.<br /><br />It's not a bad film overall, but it could have been a lot better. Had the strong writing and concepts of the first part of the movie been kept up, it would have been very good indeed. As it is, it's a three-star movie. Why anyone would give it five stars when movies like 'Close Encounters' and 'Contact' did it so much better, I'm not sure.</p></body></html>

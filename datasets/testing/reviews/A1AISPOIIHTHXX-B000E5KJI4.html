<meta name="summary" content="The woman that launched a thousand ships...and a so-so movie"></head><body><p>For some reason, Gladiator with Russell Crowe has been the uber-epic fix for people who want their storytelling rooted in history. I didn't even like it but every film that looks like a period piece is all of a sudden fodder for "not better than Gladiator" comments. While Troy is more of a spectacle than that film, it's still not a powerhouse the film wants to be.<br /><br />The basics of Troy, based loosely or exactly depending on how you're watching, on Homer's poem The Iliad, a way too long poem about an affair between Paris, prince of Troy and Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. After a celebration of Troy and Sparta being friends, the people from Troy hed back home, bringing Helen with them. Menelaus finds out, plays the anger-stricken husband so what does he do? What any other man would do: get the king of Greece, Agememnon, to command an army against Troy of course.<br /><br />Among the king's warriors is Achilles, a well-known and arrogant soldier. While all soldiers are loyal to the king, he questions him, like why would the king send tens of thousands of men just for a girl, or Troy's beliefs in the gods. Among Troy's ranks are Hector, another well-known soldier but less arrogant and more reluctant to fight if the case doesn't call for it. After the opening arrival on the beach, Achilles captures Bresias, an Apollo server, who he ends up falling for.<br /><br />It's funny how the basics of the film are 2 kids deciding to love each other and run away together only to bring death and mayhem in doing so. A huge epic story told through the eyes of teenagers not thinking things through clearly.<br /><br />As for the performances, the only 3 I liked were Peter O'Toole, playing the king of Troy; Rose Byrne(Bresias), who somehow manages to make a so-so film worth watching and make you feel symphathetic towards like in Wicker Park, even if she's vastly underused. The last one being Eric Bana, who was rather bland in Hulk, but gives the right amount of pathos and energy to a very static character. As for the others? Well, as for the 2 lovers, you wouldn't be able to stomach their performances on a bad NBC show, let alone here.<br /><br />As far as the effects are concerned, maybe Lord of the Rings spoiled me but seeing 70,000 men fight doesn't have that wowness that Pelennor Fields battle had in Return of the King. And of course, right before the battle we get another "they will never take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!" wannabe pre-battle speech, which is getting more and more common since Braveheart's release.<br /><br />All in all, you want to like this film for the amount of time and effort that was put into it, but like a car, it's got to perform well no matter how it looks and this let's say breaks down half the time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well crafted, well acted, and ultimately entertaining film"></head><body><p>"Sin City" is a piece of art work. There are no other films of which I'm aware that have taken the comic book (or graphic novel) format to the screen with such ingenuity and aplomb as Robert Rodriguez has done with Sin City.<br /><br />The acting is superb and the action gripping, flowing and beautiful.<br /><br />The story surrounds three different groups of inhabitants of "Sin City". We follow a police man (Bruce Willis) in his quest to catch a child molester/killer (Nich Stahl); a parolee (Mickey Rourke) who is set up for having killed a prostitute(Jame King); a group of prostitutes who run a section of Sin City and are headed by Rosario Dawson. The stories all come together, but not in tight neat little bundles as you many be used to. The outcome of this film noir is not necessarily a happy one.<br /><br />The graphic novel was drawn in black and white with limited usage of color. Rodriguez does the same here. It is absolutely one of the things that makes this film not only unique but gripping.<br /><br />This is an action film that warrants several viewings simply because you are going to be so caught up in how cool the film looks that you'll lose track of the plot.<br /><br />Check this one out.</p></body></html>

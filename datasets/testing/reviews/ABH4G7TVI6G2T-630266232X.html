<meta name="summary" content="elegant noir masterpiece; Gene Tierney in her trademark role"></head><body><p>LAURA remains the definitive masterpiece of the noir genre.  Gene Tierney is perfectly-cast in the title role, a mysterious young society debutante who gets caught up in a dizzying murder plot.  When a body is discovered maimed by bullets in Laura's apartment, it's naturally assumed that Laura herself is the corpse.  Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) sets about interviewing all of Laura's friends in the hopes of discovering whether Laura's death might have been foul play or suicide.  Mark grows increasingly obsessed with the elusive Laura thanks to her portrait, and gets the shock of his life when the girl herself enters her apartment, following a restful vacation.  Now Mark must discover who the real murder victim was, and how Laura fits into the puzzle.  The outstanding cast also includes Clifton Webb, Vincent Price, Judith Anderson and Grant Mitchell.  The score is highlighted by David Raskin's unforgettable "Theme for Laura".<br /><br />LAURA is a true masterpiece, and this new DVD showcases the film accordingly with a smart assortment of bonus features.  Including two complete Biography episodes "Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait" and "Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain", along with audio commentary (composer David Raskin and film historian/critic Jeanine Basinger) in addition to a second commentary track with film historian Rudy Behlmer, and a deleted scene (again with Behlmer's comments).</p></body></html>

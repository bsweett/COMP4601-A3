<meta name="summary" content="Eye, Robot"></head><body><p>Is Shia LeBeouf in too many movies? He sure is in a lot these days. I guess that I'm just getting old and I don't see the "coolness" in this guy. Or maybe I'm just tired of seeing and hearing the same personality in every movie that he's in. That's not acting. Heath Ledger in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight</a>...now THAT'S acting.<br /><br />Anyway, the first movie that I really noticed LeBeouf in, albeit briefly, was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012GVKVY">I, Robot</a>. And what a coincidence!...LeBeouf is now in a movie called Eagle Eye that steals the underlying principle of I, Robot. The rip-off was simply blatant to me. I don't want to spoil Eagle Eye for you if you're determined to see it, but, man, if you've not seen I, Robot and you're on the fence about Eagle Eye...just go with I, Robot.<br /><br />Eagle Eye has LeBeouf in the role of an ordinary guy that is suddenly thrust into the position of defending our national security...just like he was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDT6">Transformers</a>. And like in Transformers, in Eagle Eye LeBeouf magically "transforms" into a super-soldier that can handle almost any situation. But it ain't easy being a super-soldier when you're up against a foe that can use anything...I mean ANYTHING...with a lens or something that can pick up sound waves to eavesdrop in on you're every move.<br /><br />Making a very good movie is certainly not beyond Eagle Director DJ Caruso; he just seems to prefer over the top lately. Eagle Eye is so far over the top it's at the bottom of the other side. Caruso's last movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RO6K80">Disturbia</a>, (that also starred LeBeouf) wasn't as far-fetched, but it was still over the top. However, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BZD8E">Taking Lives</a> showed that Caruso has it in him to put out a better film.<br /><br />Joining LeBeouf is a pretty decent cast, including Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Chiklis. But the good cast doesn't come close to making up for how unrealistic Eagle Eye is by the time it's all said and done.<br /><br />Like I said before: Eagle Eye is very similar to I, Robot...except I, Robot was very good...Eagle Eye isn't! Go with I, Robot.</p></body></html>

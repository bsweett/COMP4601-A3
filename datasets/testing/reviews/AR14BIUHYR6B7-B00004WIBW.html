<meta name="summary" content="good HD presentation, but not perfect"></head><body><p>Yes, this was my first HD-DVD purchase and I thought it looked fabulous.  Eighteen HD-DVDs later and I am less enthusiastic about this one.  Yes it is much better than the standard presentation.  But Tim Burton films so much of this in dream-like foggy soft-focus that the presentation seems like a soft video transfer (however the sound is top notch!).  I still believe that a bit more sharpness could have been coaxed out of the original negative for this release, so this is why I give this gem of a movie 4 stars.</p></body></html>

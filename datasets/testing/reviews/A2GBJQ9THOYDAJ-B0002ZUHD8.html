<meta name="summary" content="A remarkably SILLY film"></head><body><p>This has got to be the most bizarre, the most unhistorical, and -- let's face it -- the silliest interpretation of the Arthur story that has ever groped its way to the screen. Arthur is so besotted with Rome that he dresses as a Roman cavalryman? (But with a legionary's infantry helmet.) The Knights of the Round Table are Sarmatians? Merlin is a Celt who paints himself blue? Guinevere is an Amazon? Rome is the protector of freedom? The Britons are all for "liberty" and "free will"? And the Britons, Sarmatians, Romans, and Saxons all speak the same language? (They don't even bother to pretend otherwise.) Gimme a break. Not to mention that the Saxons, not being stupid, invaded England from the south and never did reach Hadrian's Wall. The plot jumps from a time when the Sarmatians first arrive as recruits in the north of England (though they never actually fight as Romans) and Arthur is just a boy, to a scene fifteen years later, when Arthur (who, for some reason, was promised command when he was young) is running the whole show. From what everyone says, all the exciting battles took place years earlier and killed off most of the knights, so this, apparently, is their swan song. Though by skipping over those years, the director also never gives us a reason why the survivors should be so loyal to Arthur. There are a couple of good battle sequences, though the fight on the ice is dramatically superior to the big climax -- in which the Britons are suddenly in possession of artillery engines. And Keira Knightly is nice to look at -- though she's far too skinny to be convincing as a sword-swinging warrior. The only halfway believable character, in fact, is Cerdic, the Saxon chief, played menacingly by Stellan Skarsgaard. All in all, though, this film is just pathetic.</p></body></html>

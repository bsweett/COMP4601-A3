<meta name="summary" content="Superman I"></head><body><p>The original superhero movie of modern times. Spider- Man had one in the 70's but was a joke, period. Superman I is still one of the better superhero movies ever made although with Iron Man released, is no longer the best. Some would say Batman was better as well. Worth buying if you ask me.</p></body></html>

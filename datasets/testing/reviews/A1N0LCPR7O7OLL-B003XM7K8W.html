Some of the supporting performances are questionable except for Kevin Pollack who is quite good towards the end of the film.  But what really messed up this film was the storyline.  It is so cliche and old hat.  Its like a weak cross between Panic Room and Die Hard.  Don't get me wrong it has some good moments but overall the film leaves much to be desired.</p></body></html>

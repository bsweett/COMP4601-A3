Great DVD Extras!"></head><body><p>&quot;Monster's, Inc.&quot; combines a fantastic cast, cutting edge imagination, and a tender storyline into a wonderful, delightful family film . . . it may even cure the nighttime frights of your wee ones!<p>Most of us were scared stiff at some point in our childhood by the spooky, imaginary &quot;monsters in the closet,&quot; usually after we've read &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; for the first time.  &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; plays on that near-universal fear by creating a rational explanation -- monsters live in a parallel universe, connected to ours by closet doors, and they power their land by the energy contained in human screams.  Makes perfect sense!<p>Sulley (the hilarious John Goodman) is a celebrity in Monstropolis as the leading scare-getter for Monster's, Inc.  Sulley is generally a lovable big blue yeti-bear-creature, but he can be quite terrifying.  Blissfully unaware of the terror he unleashes, he enjoys his job.  Basking in Sulley's reflected glory is his sidekick and assistant, Mike Waznowski (Billy Crystal, perfect as ever).  Mike is a lime-green-yellow glob with one giant eye and an even larger mouth.  He helps Sulley get the screams and stay one step ahead of the competition.<p>And the competition is fierce.  The dragon-chameleon Boggs (Steve Buscemi, suitably creepy without being too scary for the kids) is right on Sulley's heels to be the scream champion, and he's willing to go to any lengths to beat his nemesis.<p>All is well in Monstropolis until Boo, a human child, accidentally finds her way through the closet and into Monstropolis.  It seems that as scared as kids are of monsters, the monsters are equally scared of the kids -- their touch (allegedly) brings death and ruin.  (This misunderstanding leads to great comic scenes as X-Files-type HAZMAT crews invade every time there's a kid sighting, usually to the woe of the monster who has seemingly been infected by the kid!)<p>Like all Pixar films, the glories are in the details.  Check out the gentle satire of Hollywood celebrity culture, of mindless bureaucracy, and the perils of romance in the office.  The animation is also wonderful -- Pixar continues to evolve with every picture.  For example, Sulley's fuzzy hair is fully articulated as he zooms through various escapades. <p>The story is fast-paced, with enough jokes to keep the adults laughing . . . which is good, 'cause your kids will likely keep throwing this into the DVD player.<p>Speaking of the DVD -- there are lots of fun extras on this two-disc set.  Personal favorites include the fake &quot;outtakes,&quot; similar to those at the end of &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; a short film featuring Mike showing Sulley his new hi-tech car (with hilarious consequences), and an Oscar-winning short film, &quot;For the Birds,&quot; which shows how funny animation can be, even in short doses.  There are additional extras that will keep the kiddies occupied for hours.  <p>All in all, a must for the family's DVD library.</p></body></html>

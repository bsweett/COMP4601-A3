<meta name="summary" content="The comic superhero movie I've been waiting for!"></head><body><p>There will probably never be a "superhero" movie that will stand the test-of-time as a full-blown movie CLASSIC.  Could there every be a CITIZEN KANE of some guy in a brightly colored costume flying around saving people?  Probably  not.<br /><br />But as POPULAR entertainment, some superhero movies offer more pure entertainment snap and sizzle and fun than others.  SPIDERMAN 2 overcame the silliness of the comic-book genre with some genuinely exciting and eye-popping action sequences.  BATMAN BEGINS created a visual feast of a world, and populated it with actors full of gravitas.  Even HELLBOY won out by bringing a tongue-in-cheek attitude to the whole thing.  But for me (and I'm NOT a real "fan-boy"), IRON MAN is the most well-rounded effort in this genre that I've yet seen.  The highest complement I can think to pay is that when I left the theater, I was ready to see more IRON MAN movies right away.  I  was so thoroughly enjoying myself that I wasn't ready to leave yet.<br /><br />This is due in HUGE part to the splendid performance from Robert Downey Jr.  Certainly the least likely superhero casting since Michael Keaton donned Batman's tight garb...but also perhaps the most inspired.  Downey is convincing as Tony Stark, the brilliant, hedonistic and fabulously wealthy arms manufacturer.  Stark pops with Downey's trademark under his breath, quickly mumbled jabs and bursts of wit.  He's on edge, always on the go.  We can see that his mind is moving a mile a minute...juggling a dozen things at once.  Downey's intelligence is palpable...and so is his devil-may-care-attitude.  It's nearly perfect for Stark.  And the good thing about IRON MAN is that he's really a "weapon" designed and built by a brilliant man...not a super-power brought on by circumstance from a spider bite.<br /><br /> Early in the film, Stark is visiting Afghanistan to show off a new weapon.  He's soon kidnapped and nearly killed by a Taliban-like band of terrorists, who hold him hostage and force him to build a copy of his latest weapon.  Instead, with the help of a fellow prisoner (a doctor who both saves his life and dooms him to a lifetime of heart problems)...Stark brazenly builds an escape mechanism.<br /><br />I really hate to give away more plot...because it's fun to watch the story unwind.  Downey is fully of great energy, and could carry the movie on his own.  Fortunately for us, we've also got Gweneth Paltrow (Stark's unfortunately named assistant Pepper Potts).  Paltrow has been away for a few years raising a family (GREAT for her!), but I'd nearly forgotten that in the right role, she can really be a lot of "saucy" fun.  It's a clich&eacute;d role, but she makes the most of it.  Jeff Bridges is Stark's business-partner (and later nemesis), Obadiah Stane.  (Great name.)  Bridges is shaved bald, but has a big beard...making him a striking figure.  He's smooth, silky and creepy.  Shaun Taub, who was SO good in THE KITE RUNNER, is Stark's fellow prisoner, and he does another masterful job portraying a wise older gentleman with a streak of frisky humor and a big soft spot.  He's a very good character actor, and I hope to see more of him.<br /><br />Two fairly minor quibbles with the film.  1)  Terrance Howard, as Tony's longtime friend and military liaison...is somewhat lost in his role.  To me, it's now been awhile since he gave a performance that did much for me.  He's not fulfilling his early promise.  2)  The film needs a little more action.  This is also a back-handed compliment.  For once, the flying character actually looks fairly convincing...and I wanted to enjoy more pure thrills.  I love the witty banter, the crackling dialogue and I liked the action scenes.  I wanted just a bit more of Iron Man blowing stuff up.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like this movie is stuffy and unexciting...it's just that the action was just so much fun, I actually wanted more  (unlike the action in an overstuffed film like PIRATES 3, for example...where I was craving a break!).<br /><br />So while this movie is ONLY popular entertainment...it's the best kind.  Fun, fast, witty, exciting and well-acted.  And with Robert Downey firmly in charge...it's a far cut above the average.  Absolutely for "non-fans" too!!</p></body></html>

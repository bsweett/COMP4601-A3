<meta name="summary" content="An interesting looking film that ends up being rather boring"></head><body><p>The world of "Aeon Flux" is set in the year 2415, which is basically four centuries after 99% of the human race was wipe out by a deadly virus.  What is left of humanity is living in Bregna, a protected city that is ruled by the wealthy Goodchild family and we find out that are 5 million people living in that city: which is the same number of survivors left alive when the plague was done killing off people.  Clearly life in the future is carefully controlled, and of course there are those who do not like the arrangement and who are committed to doing something about it, namely bring the whole thing down.  So, once again, a sterile futuristic world is challenged by those who sensibilities are more in keeping with our own.  If only somebody in the future had an actual personality, this 2005 film would be a lot more palatable.<br /><br />The Monicans are the rebels in this society and their primary goal is to kill the Goodchild brothers, Trevor (Marton Csokas), who is the leader, and Oren (Jonny Lee Miller), the second in command.  The killing machine Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron, reduced to playing a walking manikin) is the best agent for the Monicans, receiving her missions from the Handler (Frances McDormand), and working with her partner, Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo).  After her sister, Una (Amerlia Warner) is killed by the government, Aeon goes right after Trevor Goodchild in his Citadel to assassinate him.  But the ultimate confrontation involves Aeon finding out some information that terms the world upside down and sideways.  This is not actually that surprising, because the vibe we pick up from the bad guy is that he is not the sort of evil megalomaniac we expect to see running a futuristic world.<br /><br />There are some interesting things about this world, from capsules you swallow so you can receive other people's thoughts to learning a pointed lesson about why you do not walk on the grass in this brave new world.  The problem is that while there are things of interesting in this film, I never found "Aeon Flux" to be engaging.  What works as an animated series falls flat as live action, especially when the cast is reduced to two-dimensional performances that tend to make them indistinguishable from each other as the story spins out.  Peter Chung's MTV series provides plenty of ideas for visual treats but it does not translate into anything that proves to be memorably exciting.  But what made me round down on this one is that when we get to the big revelation, which compels us to rethink much of what we have learned about this futuristic society, my reaction was rather apathetic.  To make things worse, the more I thought about it the more I was disappointed that given what is really going on what happens in the movie was not more interesting.  After all, this society has been spinning its wheels for four centuries just to get up to this decidedly underwhelming climax.  It hardly seems worth the bother.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good sequel"></head><body><p>This movie in my opinion is a bit better than the first one, as it is more angsty, plus it introduced Doctor Octopus as a character, as well as Peter Parker struggling to keep his secret of Spider-Man from several people and the inevitable trouble this causes. Handled rather well and realistically, this is definitely not a movie to miss especially if you enjoyed the first one.</p></body></html>

Claire is experiencing the empty nest syndrome after sending off her daughter to college. Norman & Claire's idyllic life in their beautiful lakeshore Vermont home is shattered by Claire's visions of an entity, and Norman's callous dismissal of her visions only strengthens Claire's resolve to get to the bottom of the matter. The rest of the story revolves around Claire's investigative efforts that takes a supernatural twist when she tries unconventional methods to commmunicate with the spirit...and finds a shocking revelation thathas to do with the mysterious disappearance of a beautiful college student. The truth indeed does lie beneath the surface, and you will have a great time unearthing the mystery with Claire!</p></body></html>

This was a 2001 vehicle for the then slightly less famous Angelina Joli whose main claim to fame here are her enormous breasts and overly plumped fish lips. She is not a bad actress, really, but you would think she would opt for slightly more cerebral films. I guess she likes money. Poor Daniel Craig has nothing whatsoever to do here pre-James Bond.

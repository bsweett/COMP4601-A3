The plot has its ups and downs- a futuristic society where  a minority tries to overthrow the rulers who are potrayed to be something sort of dictators. The plot evolve with some iteresting twists. But the film's highpoints are theamazing HD picture, scenery and sound that are offered which makes you happy that you bought your blu-ray and HDtv. Again nothing spectacular storywise but good to watch.</p></body></html>

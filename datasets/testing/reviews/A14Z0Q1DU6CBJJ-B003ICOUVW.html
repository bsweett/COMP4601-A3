WOLFMAN isn't groundbreaking or a remake that rewrites the story or takes the story in a new direction. It just doesn't, and there's nothing wrong with that. What you do get is the creature of the WOLFMAN brought to new light with new technology. Ultimately, the original WOLFMAN with Lon Chaney, was the story of a MAN who became a wolf. The new WOLFMAN with Benicio Del Torro is the same thing, with an added bonus; the ability to show with violent and hairy detail the reality of the man's WOLF side.<br /><br />WOLFMAN is ampted up to fit the technology of the day and the audience of the day. Many may say it is gory, or even too gory, but what I say, is that it accurately shows the violent, physical and aggressive speed and strength of a man who becomes WOLF by the light of a full moon. You truly get the feeling of how horrible it is to be someone who just spent the night darting around killing and eating whatever he could, and not being in control of it.<br /><br />The music, constructed by Danny Elfman, is also something to take note of. It is beautiful and brilliant. It is a merge of old film themed music with the fined tuned chimes of today's music and it works to perfection in reminding you of the movie it is based on, and the movie that it is.<br /><br />WOLFMAN is a perfectly entertaining movie, as long as you don't go in expecting to be awed. To me, the werewolf changing scene in A WEREWOLF IN LONDON, is still awe-inspiring, and you see that same thing here, x100. Yet, people tend to take movie magic for granted these days and WOLFMAN 2010 deserves its due.</p></body></html>

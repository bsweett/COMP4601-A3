<meta name="summary" content="Long live The Queen"></head><body><p>I shall begin this review by saying that I was not an avid fan of Princess Diana.  I remember her very well when I was a child with the hubbub about the royal wedding, and she had always been one of the most prominent celebrities that I knew of.  It seems that at any one point in time someone was talking about Diana.  I said at some point that it was just celebrity garbage and fluff, and gave a big "Who cares?" about it.  But if I didn't care, why did I wake up my mom in the middle of the night on that faithful day in 1997 when she was killed in a car accident in Paris?  And watch the funeral on TV a few days later?<br /><br />I did not watch this movie based on a celebrity fascination with Diana or any other of the British royal family, but to see the true flow of relationship between the government houses.  Helen Mirren does a superior job of portraying Elizabeth II, refined and stiff upper lipped to the T.  At the same time, just weeks before, Tony Blair had been elected, the first time in years that the Labour Party had been appointed as Prime Minister.  It was also a very exciting time in England, as there was a sense of change with his election.  Just as Tony Blair was getting his feet wet in his new job, Diana is killed in a car accident.  The UK, let alone the rest of the world, was thrown into chaos.  We looked to the queen to make a statement, but she remained silent.<br /><br />This movie showed the tensions and conflict very well between the royals and the public.  Elizabeth had distain for Diana, to be sure, after the tabloid fiasco of her and Charles's divorce, so she wanted to remain silent.  From another generation of royalty and duty, she wanted to remain silent to show her respects; but, the public wanted to hear a statement as it's a different world now.  Plus having a new, enthusiastic Prime Minister pressuring her to adjust (I love that scene where they meet for the first time and she said "Winston Churchhill sat in that very same chair".), she had to say something.  And she did.<br /><br />The only critical words I have for this movie are for the portrail of Prince Charles.  I wonder how true his reaction to Diana's death was.  It's hard for me to believe that Charles shead a tear for Diana.  After their failed marriage and divorce, I'm sure there were and still are sour grapes between them.  If anything I would think that he would be glad to be rid of her once and for all, because his aunt, Princess Margaret, said it best when she said that Diana was more annoying dead than alive.<br /><br />Still, this is a fine movie that flows very easily and shows a good snapshot of a point in time.</p></body></html>

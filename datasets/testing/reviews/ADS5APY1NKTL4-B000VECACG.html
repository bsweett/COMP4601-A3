Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a father and husband, is forever changed upon experiencing a close encounter with beings from another planet, during a blackout, while in his truck, on his way to repair multiple electrical outages in his town.  Roy is changed, after having this experience, and it totally turns his life on its head in his process to really understand what he encountered in the darkness, that evening.  His wife, Romie (Teri Garr) and children cannot comprehend this sudden change in Roy, as he is driven to more and more unusual behavior, as the story progresses.  Roy encounters Gillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) and her son, Barry (Cary Guffey), who also experienced a brush with this supernatural encounter.  They are brought together by their experience, and are also divided from those around them who have not witnessed the arrival of the mysterous, night-dwelling spaceships, and the bright lights that announce their arrival.<br /><br />CLOSE ENCOUNTERS deals with some very well-executed themes.  They include the concept of life, existing on the planets beyond our Earth and the possibility that some people really are destined to explore life beyond the constraints of the world that we know.  Also, Richard Dreyfuss' character is representative of the dreamer that exists in all of us, before the world shuts down our feelings of possibility.<br /><br />What's more, this duel disc collector's edition of the film includes bonus footage that was left out of the extended version of the film, as well as a documentary that takes a closer look at the special effects and great effots that went into bringing the story to the screen.  This is great for true film buffs and anyone for whom CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was a religious experience.  The anecdotes are entertaining and insightful.  This is truly a great introduction to the films of Steven Spielberg.  Not to be missed........</p></body></html>

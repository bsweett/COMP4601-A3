<meta name="summary" content="What a debut!"></head><body><p>Quentin Tarantino makes his motion picture debut a memorable one.  Tarantino is clearly a fan of the movies.  The interraction between the characters and who these characters are makes his style different than any other filmmaker out there.  The closest I would say he comes to immitating is Paul Schrader & Martin Scorsese.  The acting is top notch.  Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are all outstanding in their roles.  The movie is raw, violent and unforgetable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The most unfunny comedy I've ever seen"></head><body><p>Though I had low expectations for THE PINK PANTHER, a so-called "prequel" to the 1963 classic, the film was even worse than I'd expected.  The notion of making a Pink Panther film without Peter Sellers is a ridiculous one, but the notion of casting Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau is even more ridiculous.  Sure enough, Martin is atrocious as Closeau.  Kevin Kline is not much better as Chief Inspector Dreyfuss.  If there's anyone in the cast that gives a good performance, it's Jean Reno as Clouseau's assistant.<br /><br />The script, by Len Blum and Martin himself, is horrible.  The jokes are completely unfunny.  People slam into things, damage is done, Martin makes a fool of himself; there's even a nice fart joke thrown in for the kids.  Even kids, however, won't find this film very funny.  The plot immediately negates all of the Sellers films, while the murderer is obvious from the start.  The good point of the film was Clive Owen, who has a few short scenes as Agent 006.  James Bond fans will realize that Owen was the top contender for the role of 007 in CASINO ROYALE, though the part eventually went to Daniel Craig.  I originally was a top supporter of Owen as Bond, and thus I loved getting a glimpse of what his James Bond may have been like.<br /><br />Christophe Beck, who composed outstanding music for the television series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, delivers a completely unextraodinary score.  It's indistinguishable from any other average Hollywood score, which is a pity.  Even Henry Mancini's delightful theme seems misused and hokey here.<br /><br />THE PINK PANTHER is a dumb, dumb film which tries way too hard to make people laugh.  There's nary a brain in its head.  It is very possibly the most unfunny comedy I've ever seen.  Don't hesitate to avoid it.</p></body></html>

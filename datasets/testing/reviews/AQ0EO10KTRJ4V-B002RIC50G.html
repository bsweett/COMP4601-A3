<meta name="summary" content="Very Well Done.....We liked better than original SOTL"></head><body><p>We really thought this was a well done film in the Hannibal Lector saga.<br /><br />In fact, I have to confess I never really saw the fascination with the original "Silence of the Lambs".<br /><br />I always felt that film was kind of bland and never understood how it became such a craze. Perhaps I will watch it again sometime soon now and see if I like it better all these years later.<br /><br />But as I sit here writing this today, I would have to say I found this new "prequel"-- HANNIBAL RISING to be a more entertaining and intriguing film than the original that started it all.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A timeless classic"></head><body><p>It has been over two decades since I last saw Disney's animated film SLEEPING BEAUTY. I was just a small child in elementary school when I first saw the film. Once again, Disney digs deep into their vault and re-releases the classic animated film as part of their platinum edition series. The two dvd set includes the remastered version of the film and a slew of bonus features that the family is sure to enjoy.<br /><br />The story of Aurora, princess to King Stefan, she is a welcomed into the kingdom with a lavished celebration. The infant is greeted by King Hubert and his son Prince Philip, whom Aurora is betrothed to marry later in life. Then Aurora is paid a visit by the three good fairies Fauna, Merryweather, and Flora. Flora and Fauna are able to bless the child with the gift of beauty and song but before Merryweather could bless the child, the evil witch Maleficent drops in unexpectedly. Displeased that her presence was not wanted at the celebration, Maleficent curses the child that she will die at the age of 16 with a single prick to her finger by a spindle. Thankfully Merryweather weakens the curse to simply a deep sleep. Reluctantly, King Steffan allows the three good fairies to take Aurora out of the kingdom until she is the age of 16, to protect Auroa from Maleficent's curse.<br /><br />As mere mortals, the three fairies raises Aurora as Briar Rose in the forest without raising a suspicion. In the meantime, Maleficent has her army (who are totally incompetent for comedic value) out searching for Aurora for 16 years. When she realizes her army's mistake of looking for a baby for 16 years, Maleficent sends out her pet raven Diablo to search for Aurora. With the assistance of the fairies, Prince Philip goes to rescue the princess who had fallen under the evil witch's spell.<br /><br />Everything you expect in a Disney animated film is there, song, comedy, drama, and a anti-climatic ending is here in the lavished remastered film. This was the first time I have seen SLEEPING BEAUTY since I was a child. I almost forgotten how good this film is. The colors in this new version is vibrant. The music is beautiful. The music in today's Disney animated films lacks the beauty and elegence of the classic Disney films like the orchestral score for SLEEPING BEAUTY. Once again Disney does a wonderful job at remastering and re-packaging SLEEPING BEAUTY.</p></body></html>

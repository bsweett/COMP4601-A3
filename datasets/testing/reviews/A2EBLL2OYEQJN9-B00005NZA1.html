<meta name="summary" content="No comparison to other M. Night Shyamalan films"></head><body><p>Unbreakable is overwhelmingly underwhelming as a movie.  It has slow, deliberate pacing and takes itself far, far too seriously.  It took Bruce Willis an hour and eighteen minutes to even entertain the idea that he had special powers, when the viewer knew it from square one.  Knowing that this is an M. Night Shyamalan movie, viewers can expect a big twist of a pay-off at the end of the movie, and Shyamalan doesn't disappoint.  It's not clear if the journey is worth it, however.</p></body></html>

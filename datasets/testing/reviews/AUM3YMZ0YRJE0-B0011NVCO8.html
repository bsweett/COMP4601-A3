To be sure, the story is pretty run-of-the-mill:  after a long apprenticeship with a Harlem manipulator, a young hustler figures out a new way to get pure heroin into the country.  He then runs it like a business, establishing a superior brand and building an empire.  Meanwhile, a cop focuses on him, and you can guess the rest.<br /><br />What made this a fabulous experience was the acting:  Washington is second to none in his ability to project an entire environment and background into every gesture.  Crowe is also superb as an honest, though troubled cop, who gets extraordinary powers to build a team and pursue him.  In between, you get a vivid (and thankfully not too detailed) picture of the times, from the Vietnam War to the changing role of blacks in US society.  Taken together, the film is a true gem, one of Scott's best in my opinion.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Harrison's Distress....."></head><body><p>I don't know, maybe I'm being harsh, but I've seen Harrison Ford's "Everyman in Distress" act one time too many.  After all the Jack Ryan movies, and Air Force One (yeah, I know he was the President, but he was an Everyman President)and so on, its like I know every facial expression and every voice intonation that he's going to use.  Probably not fair, after all he only has one face and voice, but I've seen this bit enough and wouldn't pay to see it again.  Harrison used to try to stretch himself, oh well.<br /><br />As to the movie, it is only a passable thriller greatly helped by Paul Bettany's villain. I don't care whether the tech tricks were viable or not, this is a movie.  But the cliches were fast and furious wherein every advantage the hero or his family gets or creates is undone in the next moment so that their peril either increases or begins all over again.  They do dumb things and they do them often.<br /><br />This is the kind of flick that will hold your interest for awhile and you'll probably see it through to the end, but will just as quickly forget completely in short order.  I wouldn't recommend it. You've seen it all many times before. 2-1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

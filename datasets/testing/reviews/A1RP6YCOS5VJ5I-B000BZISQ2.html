<meta name="summary" content="5 Star Movie"></head><body><p>This movie is a really great installment in the franchise and I think that this is one of those kind of films that grow more popular through the years. If you are a fan of the Terminator series, then you will find some fun to be had with this movie. There is ton of action and the story really advances the mythology as John meets the person who will eventually teach him how to lead the human resistance.<br /><br />The opening storyline of the movie is also very interesting when the new Terminator, the T-X, targets John's future lieutenants. The T-X is a very cool new Terminator and is more advanced than the T-1000. Arnold is awesome as always, the best line has to be when he asks the male stripper to take his clothes off. Overall, I think this movie is really cool and will become even more important when the next film comes out.</p></body></html>

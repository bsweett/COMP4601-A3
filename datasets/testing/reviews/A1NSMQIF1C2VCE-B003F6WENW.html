<meta name="summary" content="Strong buddy comedy"></head><body><p>It's either a good sign or a bad sign, depending on your view of such things, that 90 percent of the dialogue in Wedding Crashers sounds like the stuff I heard around the fraternity house back in college. That goes for both the mature stuff and the immature stuff alike.<br /><br />Now, some folks will read a paragraph like that, and go screaming for the door. Bye!<br /><br />The others will go to the door, pause, and wonder "mature stuff?" Come back on in, folks. We've got a juvenile comedy about getting your ya-yas off and then growing up.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (and the luminous Rachel McAdams and the kind of fascinating Christopher Walken) absolutely sell this buddy movie, about buddies who have discovered, they think, the ultimate way to hook up with girls. But crashing weddings and nailing emotionally vulnerable women only works until the guys fall for some of the girls. And when that happens, the emotionally retarded is totally unprepared to deal with the consequences.<br /><br />Wonderfully and believably profane while still being sweet and even kind of smart, Wedding Singers is a great movie for every aging frat boy out there, and those that love us despite all that.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.</p></body></html>

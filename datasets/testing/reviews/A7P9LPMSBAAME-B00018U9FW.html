<meta name="summary" content="JACK BLACK IS CUTE AND THE KIDS ARE EVEN CUTER"></head><body><p>Pretty much a normal Jack Black vehicle, but for the element of kids and opening the world of music to them and all the positive, life affirming changes that are a result of this musical education. Black is very good (for what it is) in this role. In the back story in special features, the director said he wrote this for Jack Black, specifically. Very few actors could have done as good in this part as Black. In real life, Black is an accomplished musician, and, I believe a nice guy that is still a kid at heart. That really comes across in this movie. And there are laughs. And the music is good. This movie is not, necessarily, a long term keeper, but I liked watching it and I would watch it again knowing I would like it again. I recommend it. GOOD JOB JACK.</p></body></html>

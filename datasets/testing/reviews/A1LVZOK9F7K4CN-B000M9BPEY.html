<meta name="summary" content="Tim goes sentimental..."></head><body><p>I'm not quite sure how diehard Tim Burton fans will take to this movie.  For one thing, it is Tim stab at making a sentimental movie.  Now, so far, Tim's stock-and-trade has been irony.  That his not to say that his films are not life-affirming - paradoxically, Beetlejuice is tremendously life-affirming.  However, this movie aims for the heart and does it without any trace of cynicism.  <p>The salvation of the movie comes from the imagination of the stories Bloom tells and Burton's visual sensibility.  This is Burton's best movie in years.  (Planet of the Apes was AWFUL.)  As we watch the always-engaging Ewan McGregor get into one unbelievable adventure after another, we can't help but be amused.  This is not a movie with a beginning or an end - just a whole lot of middle.<p>Once again, it's not quite Edward Scissorhands, but it deserves much more attention than it got when it was originally in theaters.</p></body></html>

A new President (Josef Sommer) is so sympathetic to their concerns that he has created a Department of Mutant Affairs, helmed by one of their own--former X-Man Dr. Hank "Beast" McCoy (Kelsey Grammar).  At Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, the mansion has been repaired after the commando incursion of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BWVCM">X2 - X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>, and students of all sizes scurry through the halls at class-change time.  Even Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seems to have settled in as part of the team, although in Danger Room simulations he still has a tendency to bend the rules.  But Scott Summers (James Marsden) is so consumed by grief over the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) that he's abdicated his position as leader, forcing Storm (Halle Berry) to step into the slot--a job she doesn't want.  And Magneto (Ian McKellen) remains at large and a matter of deep concern to the government.  Then Jean is unexpectedly resurrected from the depths of Alkali Lake.  But Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) fears what the strain of saving herself may have done to her Class 5 mutant powers.  Meanwhile, Warren Worthington II (Michael Murphy), head of a great pharmaceutical company, has announced the creation of a vaccine that can suppress--permanently--all mutant ability.  Despite assurances that taking it will be entirely voluntary, Magneto, that survivor of the Holocaust, fears what its existence may mean and begins assembling a mutant army called "The Brotherhood."  In the end, it's five Xavier students against a mass of raging outlaw mutants with a weapon that may mean the end of the world.<br /><br />This splendid climax to the X-Men trilogy is worth every cent of its cost, from the sensitive portrayals of inner conflict suffered by Wolverine, Xavier, Storm, and Jean to the thunderous John Powell score (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBFTCS">X-Men:  The Last Stand (Original Motion Picture)</a>) to the introduction of imaginative new mutant characters (including Ben Foster as Worthington's son/namesake, Angel, with his gorgeous 20-foot wingspan) to the stunning special effects.  (I'm only disappointed that Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler didn't make a return appearance.)  Note: If you didn't see it in the theater, DO NOT stop the player until after the credits have rolled.  You'll see a short scene that hints of more to come--and if it's as good as this, I can't wait!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Phoenix Rising"></head><body><p>Amid a world of gray and umber colored shadows that perfectly symbolize the bleakness of the Great Depression, Ron Howard brings viewers the light of Hope in the story of boxer, Jim Braddock.<br />  Russell Crowe plays this emblem of the Greatest Generation with grace, dignity, and an understated bravura. The first few moments of the film show his defeat of Tuffy Griffith(Thomasz Kurzydlowski)and the prosperous life that the "Bulldog of Bergen" shares with his devoted wife, Mae (Renee Zellweger) and their three children at the end of the 1920s, and then as the camera slowly pans across a dresser top with an abundance of possessions, the screen fades to black, and we see a dresser top with a few meager possessions in a dimly lit room, the stark reality of the Depression's impact on the Braddock family descends on viewers.<br /> Having lost his money through bad investments, by 1933, he and his family are living in a tenement house where Braddock sacrifices his only daily meal to feed his daughter, and the fear of being sent to live with relatives due to parental inability to feed him--which was the fate of a close friend-- drives young Jay Braddock to steal a salami from the butcher. Braddock Sr. disciplines his son and promises him that he will not send him away.<br /> After breaking his right hand in a fight against Abraham Feldman(Dave Litzinger) at Mount Vernon, Braddock is decommissioned and the level of despair increases. While Jim is occasionally picked to work at the docks, he is not always chosen, and cannot earn enough to prevent the heat from being turned off . When one of their sons becomes ill, Mae, unaware of Jim's promise not to send the children away, farms them out to relatives, forcing Jim to apply for relief, and to beg associates for money to pay the heating bill. The level of despair and humiliation in his eyes is plausible.<br /> The dawn on the heels of the darkness arrives slowly. But not before we view the tension caused between friends of the Braddocks(Paddy Considine, Rosemarie DeWitt) which reveals itself even at a child's birthday party.<br /> Soon Braddock's faithful manager, Joe Gould(Paul Giamatti), who has fostered him through prosperity as well as austerity (and who barely keeps up appearances himself)is helping him return to the ring, giving him the successful opportunity to defeat Corn Griffin(Art Binkowski), and later, John Henry Lewis (Troy Amos-Ross)and Art Lasky(Mark Simmons). In the last of those three fights, nothing symbolizes Braddock's determination more than his picking up his toothguard and putting it back in his mouth after receiving Lasky's most effective punch, amid thoughts of his family and money troubles.<br /> There is a lovely scene where, after repaying his relief money, he presents his wife with roses. But soon it is overshadowed by the tragedy of a good man wasted by trying times.<br /> Crowe's role in this movie touches on others that he's played.-- His defense of a woman from possible violence, and his playing to the crowd for the love of his family are highly reminiscent of "L.A. Confidential", "Mystery, Alaska" ,and "Gladiator" combined.It seems a matter of course that an actor with his physical build would eventually play a boxer.  He captures Braddock's heart, spirit, and sinew magnificently, glistening with sweat as he takes on each opponent. He rises like a phoenix from the ashes of poverty and despair, and inspires many.<br /> The film reaches its climax when Braddock is slated to fight Max Baer(Craig Bierko), and Mae's tension hits the heights when she sees her husband, seemingly unconcerned about Baer's having killed two men in the ring, sparing in jest with the children.<br /> The only serious flaw of this film is in the portrayal of Baer's cockiness over killing two opponents, when in fact, he was deeply remorseful about it and even paid for the education of the children of one of his victims.<br /> But the end game is truly a fanfare for the Common Man, and overall, Howard has sung adequate homage to the sweetness of the American Dream, and done great justice to the pluck and determination of the Braddocks, whose virtues of faith, rescoursefulness, and support of those closest to them should be emulated by us all.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kingdom of Heaven is a decent epic."></head><body><p>The film isn't incredibly memorable; it won't go into the annals of filmdom like `Lawrence of Arabia,' `Lord of the Rings' or `Gladiator.' To me this film can be viewed on a rainy day. `Kingdom of Heaven' has the action, excitement, and interest. The story, the cinematography, and the acting are fine as well but I think the film misses its attempt to have an emotional core. It's primary focus is on the politics of the situation between the Christians and Muslims and the kings of both sides. But all films require an emotional core around the central characters to work well, or it's just pages out of a fictional textbook.<br /><br />Part of the problem is the writing. The writers mention the tragic loss of the lead character's wife, and there is a very touching scene on the Mount, but then the matter is subsequently dropped. The writers mention the need of the lead character to redeem himself, and it is barely mentioned again until the very end. This redemption does have a nice payoff at the end, but by the time that happens you've forgotten all about it. There is also a minor plot element regarding a romance between two characters, but that too is almost forgotten until the end (where there isn't the best payoff).<br /><br />The other problem is Orlando Bloom. He simply lacks the passion to be a lead character. He is fine in the broody, silent, reflective moments, but he does not project any sort of passion when required. He can't portray anger, or grief, or inspiration, or joy very well. It's something he should clearly work on, it's going to keep him back from truly being a great actor.<br /><br />The film does have redeeming moments, such as the siege of Jerusalem and the humor only brothers-in-arms could create, much less appreciate. The cinematography, set design and costumes are beautiful, and the action is believable and exciting yet not gory. Ridley Scott's `Kingdom of Heaven' is a good epic and for those who likes this genre will enjoy it.</p></body></html>

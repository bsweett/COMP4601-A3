Watching the film will be more enjoyable the less you hear about it before viewing.  But if you must read a review, here is mine (free of spoilers):<p>Matchstick Men is one of the safest films to recommend in years.  While many people won't love it, almost everyone will enjoy it.  It is often funny, sometimes charming and always interesting.  Nicolas Cage plays a conman.  Much like in The Sopranos, his life is sorted into three areas: criminal activity, family and therapy.  <p>What makes this film different than most flim-flam films is that a film about Cage's character would be fascinating regardless of his profession.  He is obsessive compulsive, neurotic, depressed, unstable, etc.  Cage has the misfortune of following Jack Nicholson's turn as a similarly afflicted person in As Good As it Gets.  In his turn, Cage is no less convincing and brings a degree of humanity to the character that was missing from Jack's abrasive writer.  <p>I won't speak much about the plot of the film, but will only say his three worlds (job, family, therapy) constantly intersect and come together in a very satisfying ending.  The film has the look of a nice Armani  suit and is often accompanied by the smooth sounds of Sinatra.  Not to be missed is an Oscar-worthy supporting performance by Sam Rockwell as Cage`s understudy.  <p>Also featured on the DVD is a great commentary track by director Ridley Scott and writer Nicolas Griffin.  It is one of the most honest and forthcoming tracks I have ever heard.  They really do a fine job explaining the nuances of the script and give away a lot of reasons for decisions they made that many other artists would have kept secret.</p></body></html>

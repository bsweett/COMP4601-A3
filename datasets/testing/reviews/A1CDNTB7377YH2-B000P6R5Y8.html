<meta name="summary" content="A Very Deep Movie for the Child in Us"></head><body><p>For those of us who fantasized about make-believe lands, this movie is right up our alley!  Two misfits (a boy and girl) become friends, bonded by a play area across a stream from the boy's house.  They swing across the stream on a rope that the girl says is enchanted.  While on the other side they imagine a different world called Tarabithia which seems to come alive.<br /><br />As the two bond together, they seem to make peace with the rest of the world from the kids that bully them at school to the boy's seemingly cold father, and the boy's sweet little sister that he seems to always ignore.<br /><br />This is a movie that you really need to be an adult to understand.  This is a different experience from the other movies of this genre (The Chronicles of Narnia, The Golden Compass).  I found this movie very enjoyable!</p></body></html>

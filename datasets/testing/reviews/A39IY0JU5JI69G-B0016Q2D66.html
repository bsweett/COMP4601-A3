<meta name="summary" content="Good film for the Fifties"></head><body><p>I went to see this film, in spite of mediocre reviews, just to see Winslet and DiCaprio.  They did not disappoint!  I sat through the whole thing just because of their amazing performances, especially Winslet's.<br /><br />However...the script is a whole other thing!  I understand, from reading other reviews here, that the novel from which the film was made was written in the late fifties and that explains a lot.  The main issue appears to be the stultifying influence of suburban life and the impossibility for any sentient being, especially one with artistic aspirations, to live a decent life there.  As we, in 2009, look at the house which poor April (Winslet) feels is her prison we groan.  Poor woman has to put up with that, and wear her nice clothes and stay home and cook for her two beautiful children and then sleep with her handsome husband.  We weep for her dilemma!  No wonder she screams all the time at the guy who goes to work every day at a job he hates in order to finance all this...<br /><br />What bothered me about the film was that it seemed that Mendes was sympathizing with April and making the husband the bad guy.  I'm a woman and I found it hard to sympathize with April at all.  The husband keeps trying to talk to her about their relationship problems and she just doesn't want to talk.  That sounds backwards to me!<br /><br />I lived through the 50's and do remember the problems that the novel is addressing.  I haven't read it but it sounds like it was a good treatise for that time.  But now, fortunately, we have evolved and the problems of these people seem really unrealistic to modern eyes.  I kept agreeing with the husband who said that they could have a happy life, yes even there in the gorgeous Connecticut suburban house that seemed to have a woods in the back yard.  A raise was coming, her husband had found something in his job that finally captured his interest, it seemed that their problems were solved.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was the way the children were treated.  We saw them, once, idyllically photographed through the spray of the garden hose, but they weren't around much.  April claimed to love them but we don't see much interaction with them. There was more interaction with the neighbors.  What really was April's problem?  She didn't seem to be much of an actress.  If she really wanted to pursue acting, Manhattan was only a train ride away and she could have hired a baby sitter and taken classes with Lee Strasberg or Herbert Berghoff!  Maybe the novel gives more background on her to make her incredible unhappiness more justifiable.  But the way Mendes makes this film, she is shown to suffer simply because she has to live there and egad, have another beautiful child and somehow it's her husband's fault.<br /><br />By the end of the film I had lost any sympathy for April, in spite of Winslet's superb performance and I wished her husband better luck next time.<br /><br />I have to wonder what in this film attracted Mendes---perhaps the opportunity to work with his wife and the added attraction of the reunion of the Titanic co-stars.  Too bad he didn't wait for a better script.</p></body></html>

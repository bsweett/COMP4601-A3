<meta name="summary" content="Good acting efforts with a poor script"></head><body><p>This film is certainly a mixture. The acting is excellent but the script is stereotypical and overly dramatic. The art direction, costumes, scenery, and photography are top of the line but the plot is highly predicable and unbelievable. I found that Clive Owen and Ian Gruffudd did an excellent job of acting but the lines they had to say were so predictable and formulaic that I found myself feeling sorry for the actors having to make these overly emotive statements about abstractions that are barely relevant to the plot. I actually did not have as much of a problem with historical accuracy as many of the other reviewers since there was a period in which Christianized Romans gradually retreated from England, leaving the island to warring Angles, Saxons, Celts, and other native Brittan's. The concept that the Knights of the Round Table were Sarmatians integrated into the Roman army was also an interesting hypothesis. Most traditions have Lancelot as a native of Gaul or modern day France. The character of Guinevere seemed the most implausible. A Celtic woman warrior seemed to be the boldest interpretation so far of the character and position of Guinevere. The Knights of the Round Table, unfortunately, all got mixed together so that it was difficult to distinguish one from another. Merlin is a Celtic wise man and warrior in this interpretation rather than an established part of the court. In the end, I felt this film could have been much more if the screen writers had trusted the audience to comprehend a more sophisticated, realistic script. It was the script that pulled this whole film down despite the considerable talents that went into its making.</p></body></html>

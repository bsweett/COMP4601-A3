<meta name="summary" content="Is Michael Jackson the real Willy Wonka?"></head><body><p>Who's idea was it to make Willy Wonka look like Michael Jackson?  Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson, but I'm talking when he was younger and still black.  I also love Johnny Depp, in almost every movie he's been in, but I really feel he was miscast in this movie! Or at least they should have made him look a little more normal.  The movie had good special effects, and decent acting, but overall it was nothing special.</p></body></html>

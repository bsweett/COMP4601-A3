<meta name="summary" content="An Extremely Un-PC Political Comedy--"Borat" Turns Itself Into The Year's Most Controversial Film"></head><body><p>I guess I am shocked at how divisive this film seems to be--it's apparently another in the camp of "love it" or "hate it."  I was familiar with Sasha Baron Cohen and the Borat character from HBO's "Da Ali G Show".  While I was amused by this reprehensible, yet surprisingly innocent "Kazahstanian," I was skeptical about a full fledged big screen treatment.  Turning a comedy skit into a feature movie is a "iffy" proposition, at best.  Take a look at almost every Saturday Night Live adaptation for corroboration.  I'd have to say, then, that I was pleasantly surprised--Borat is a winner.<br /><br />Part scripted, partly hidden camera improv, partly "Jackass" tomfoolery--you're never quite sure what is to be believed in "Borat".  Some may feel that this limits the film's effectiveness as commentary, but I feel this enhances it's comedic appeal.  For there is such unbridled outrageousness to be had in "Borat," it's hard not to be caught up in the spirit.  I probably laughed more consistently within the framework of this spare 83 minute film than I have all year.  Some of it is dumb humor, to be sure--some of it was shock value or disbelief.<br /><br />But a large part of the humor comes from real life.  By playing the moronic, offensive imbecile--Cohen, and thus Borat, expose a cavalier prejudice, hypocrisy, and/or intolerance that exists within American culture.  Whether it's buying a gun to kill Jews, viewing women as sex objects to be violated, or supporting the genocide of our enemies--Borat always finds willing subjects to engage, people who in one way or another identify with these barbaric ideas.<br /><br />It's tempting to dismiss Borat as offensive nonsense, I know many have already stated that opinion.  It might also be tempting for others to embrace "Borat" as one of the more unapologetic and politically relevant films in quite some time.  But I don't think it is attempting anything quite so significant--and that, in truth, may be it's greatest success.  It walks the line unlike any other film in recent memory.  It has elicited much love from fans and major critics and much hatred from it's detractors.  This power to provoke such passion, such debate--be it feelings, emotions, thoughts, ideas--that is the film's crowning achievement.  This crazy little film is not only one of the year's funniest films, it has also become one of the year's most talked about.  Who can argue with that?  KGHarris, 11/06.</p></body></html>

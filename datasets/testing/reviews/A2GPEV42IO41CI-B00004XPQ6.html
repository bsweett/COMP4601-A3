The story opens in 1776, and South Carolinian Martin is arguing against going to war. He feels his priority is the safety of his family. However, when his fifteen-year old son, Thomas, is brutally murdered by the odious Red Coat, Col. Tavington, (deliciously played by Jason Isaacs), he and Gabriel join the militia.<br /><br />The grand battle scenes are intertwined with intimate vignettes about the individuals in the militia: Gabriel falls in love and marries, Martin has romantic feelings for his sister-in-law, and his traumatised daughter speaks for the first time.<br /><br />Mel Gibson is wonderful as the honorable and loving father and soldier. Heath Ledger is the stuff teen-idols are made of.  You'll love to hate Jason Isaacs, who almost steals the show as the arrogant and sadistic Col. Tavington.  The Patriot is a rousing tale of our early history, with excellent actors, script, and soundtrack.</p></body></html>

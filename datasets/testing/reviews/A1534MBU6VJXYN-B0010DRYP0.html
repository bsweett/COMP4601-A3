While that is up for debate, there is no doubt that it's up there. Brutal, shocking and true, "Goodfellas" is cinema at best.<br /><br />Martin Scorcese directs and Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci lead the pack of an amazing bunch talented actors in this tale of notorious gangster turned rat Henry Hill (played with a quiet ferocity by Liotta). As a kid, Hill become caught up in the world of the mob. Working for reputed mob Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), he does some small jobs before moving into the big league. He meets veteran criminal Jimmy "The Gent" Conway (Robert De Niro) and the wacko Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci, who was brilliant). The three hook up for a series of violent crimes over the years. Henry also goes through a tumultous marriage to Karen (Lorraine Bracco). As the years go on, the stakes get higher, these Goodfellas come closer to getting caught every day. Eventually, justice reigns, and the price is paid. And if the ending is disappointing, don't forget that all of this happened.<br /><br />This film is truly a masterpiece. It's by far Scorcese's best film, and the actors have rarely been better. Pesci deserved his Oscar, because he stole the show from everyone. This is a film that everyone should see at least once.</p></body></html>

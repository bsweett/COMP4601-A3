They encounter people that they know from their youth, and the result is a number of funny circumstances. Raunchy humor abounds in this look back at life in the 80's. The film is not for everyone, but if some coarse language does not have you heading for the exit, you will get quite a few laughs out of this one.</p></body></html>

It's a little weird with a few quirks thrown in for good measure. It's basically a love story though so if you are into that, then there is a lot here for you to grab onto. Jim Carrey ultimately meets Kate Winslet, who is the most confusing, multifaceted free-spirited woman that Jim's character has never met (until now). They meet on a train and she weirdly introduces herself to him as he acts a bit coy and somewhat defensive. The movie more or less centers around these two's story with side characters getting their small roles sewed in also. I don't wanna spoil anything major for you but the last 15 or so minutes of the movie had me in immense tears for the sheer intensity (this is a love story, after all!).<br /><br />I would recommend anyone who still hasn't seen this wonderful 2004 hit to watch it if you still believe in love! It has a story with plenty of interesting twists and a plot that keeps you on edge in places. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is now up there with some of my favorite movies of all-time such as "American Beauty" and "The Lion King".<br /><br />Two thumbs way the hell up!<br /><br />5 full stars.</p></body></html>

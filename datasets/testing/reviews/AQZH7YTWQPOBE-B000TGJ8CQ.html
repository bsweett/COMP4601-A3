<meta name="summary" content="Predicting the future can be dangerous"></head><body><p>The plot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ8CQ">Next</a> is both simple and subtle. Chris Johnson (Nicholas Cage), a Los Vegas magician, can see 2 minutes into the future. A federal agent (Julianne Moore) forces him to use his abilities to find a group of terrorists with a nuclear bomb.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ8CQ">Next</a> is based on a Philip K. Dick story. Dick's works tended to be cerebral and explore the hidden consequences of odd plot twists, such as the ability to predict the future. This movie obviously doesn't get quite as thoughtful, but it does raise some of the issues, such whether Chris Johnson would merely become a tool of the government if he helped them find the bomb. However, I thought these moral dilemmas were resolved a bit too easily by suddenly allowing him to see further into the future.<br /><br />Overall, the movie combines action with a provocative plot twist. Nicholas Cage's acting is actually not bad in this movie. I didn't like Julianne Moore's character or the way she plays her. Her agent comes across as an annoying know-it-all. She somehow seems to know more than the rest of the FBI agents combined. Other than that, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ8CQ">Next</a> is an entertaining sci-fi flick, if not quite as thought-provoking as the story it was based on.</p></body></html>

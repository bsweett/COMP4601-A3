<meta name="summary" content="THE DARK KNIGHT"></head><body><p>This version of Batman is all about Tim Burton's vision of Batman as the dark knight, and agreeably the noir lends itself to better explain the legend.<br /><br />On the feature disc, Kim Basinger is shown commenting that her addition to the film is the only bright spot in Batman's life. Well okay Kim, but Sean Young, who was originally cast in the role would have definitely added to the darkness and further enhanced the depth of the noir legend. Unfortunately, Sean Young was thrown from a horse and unable to continue in the role. A great loss!<br /><br />The added features greatly add to the viewers enjoyment of the film.</p></body></html>

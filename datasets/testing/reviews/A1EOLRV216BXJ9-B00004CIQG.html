<meta name="summary" content="A dark film with its comic moments and a serious message"></head><body><p>Upon a nuclear attack on the Soviets ordered by the mad general (Sterling Hayden), the President (Peter Sellers) and the generals (most notably George C. Scott) had an important meeting at the Pentagon to resolve the crisis.<br /><br />George C. Scott was the man to see in the film. He had great speeches to make and his convictions were unfaltered right to the end. Peter Sellers (as the President, the aide captain to the mad general as well as the ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove) was everywhere in the film. I never saw Peter Sellers in such a serious role as the President.  The most impressive shot is the one when the military man riding on the bomb down to USSR.<br /><br />Many parts of the film was documentary like, deliberatley so. But I can't help noticing that(1) 18 minutes before the bomb was to be on USSR soil, the Presidents of the 2 countries were still exchanging pleasantries on the phone. (2) the man on the falling bomb was holding in a position most convenient for the camera but defying gravity nevertheless. (3) the captain (Peter Sellers) could manage to phone the President from a military base. All these begged disbelief and contributed the comical/cynical elements to the film, they were more symbolic than anything else.<br /><br />A film with sarcastic, dark moments and an ending to be pondered.</p></body></html>

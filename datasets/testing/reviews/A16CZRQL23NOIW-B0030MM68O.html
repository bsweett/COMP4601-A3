<meta name="summary" content="To face agaisnt a silent enemy is like to take a wallk on the wild side!"></head><body><p>Hurt locker is a weird film. It's focused around the role of  many times forgotten personage in the war, this expert in deactivating deadly, mortal and  sophisticated weapons.<br /><br />Irak, 2004. In the first third of the film we will assist to a sort of documental account. First dealing with the deactivation of two weapons, then the massacre in the desert and finally realizing that nothing can make it to save the life of a n innocent. During the adagio of the film we will watch how these guys spent their free time, and we'll witness how the fraternity of this antihero with a sympathetic child will become an act of personal justice when this boy be murdered by the enemy.<br /><br />The spontaneity of the script is probably its main strength. One can feel that the hazardous and tensional moments are by themselves the dramatic core of the film. Dislike Platoon, for instance, there're not philosophical gestures or the well accustomed dichotomy between the good guys and the bad guys.<br /><br />In Vietnam, you could see your enemy through the eyes of the jungle, but under the inclement heat of the desert, the enemy is invisible. You have not a direct contact with it and so, we have a kind of technological conflagration. You fight against the mortal device not with the enemy, and if case you deal with it the nocturnal sequences demand from you other tactics and procedures.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow made an admirable and nervous camera handle, remarking (as Petersen did in Das boot) the anguishing frenzy of being dead or alive in question of seconds where a false movement is just the difference.<br /><br />The film simply doesn't pretend to become a denounce film. It presents us without anesthesia (and in this sense it reminds us to Black hawk) the real situation on the battlefield where the enemy is always behind innocent people used as shield in the most of cases.</p></body></html>

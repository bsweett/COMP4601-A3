<meta name="summary" content="pure excitement"></head><body><p>There's really only one major issue with Unstoppable- that being, it's so fantastic the way it focuses on nonstop, high-speed chase train excitement that it'd be almost impossible for any OTHER film to come along and make a train movie any more action-packed than this.  It's THAT good!<br /><br />I'm still pretty darn amazed just how much I enjoyed Unstoppable while watching it this afternoon.  I *almost* passed it up too, believing it couldn't be anywhere as good as the description says.  I was totally wrong!<br /><br />It's exactly what you've been reading about- a train goes out of the control when the driver makes a silly, critical mistake and is forced to jump off the train to correct the problem (while the train is in motion).<br /><br />Of course he's so out of shape he's unable to get back on the train before it takes off on its own and eventually builds up enough speed to become a serious threat to major populated areas.  Not only that, but the train is carrying dangerous chemicals that threaten the safety of innocent people all over town.<br /><br />Throughout the film many people try to stop the train but everyone fails hard and heavy.  I'm surprised how much detail was involved pertaining to train knowledge.  The movie writers must have brought in some professionals to make everything seem so believable.<br /><br />Overall, the action is beyond amazing and continuous, the acting is really intense and defines edge of your seat suspense the way it involves a rookie train driver clashing with the professionals and attempting to make a point that even a rookie can get the job done, and it's just a really spectacular movie overall.  Expect to have a LOT of fun watching this.</p></body></html>

Liam Neeson is a teriffic actor of that there is no doubt, but my fear was that this would just be another formula action movie, which would give the makers an excuse to have a lot of explosions and car chases.<br /><br />In fact its a decent thriller, which at around an hour and a half doesn't outstay its welcome. The first half of the movie is surprisingly well controlled, giving you a chance to both sympathise and get frustrated with Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) already difficult relationship with his daughter.<br /><br />The movie changes up a gear at the halfway point and for me this doesn't quite work. The plot gets less and less beliveable and our hero avoids thousands of rounds bullits. However, its still better than a lot of formula actions movies. This is mainly thanks to Liam Neesons fine acting (as always) and the good use of locations in France. Its always great to see a film shot outside of the U.S.<br /><br />Overall then if you suspend belief this is a fine action movie. Its not in the same class as the first Bourne film, but there are many many worse films out there.</p></body></html>

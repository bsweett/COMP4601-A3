The movie explores our collective national nightmare about the assassination of the President and its potential links to Castro, the Mob, the CIA, and of course Vietnam and the Military-Industrial Complex. It does not merely suggest that a great evil befell our country that horrible day in 1963, but shouts it from the rooftops. How Stone ever got this movie made is beyond me. But I'm glad he did.<p>&quot;JFK&quot; is first and foremost a movie. It is not a documentary and it is not journalism. I agree with critics and others who find its value in its willingness to confront such a difficult subject and exhort its audience to question authority, use their &quot;eyes and ears and good sense.&quot; Did Oliver Stone convince me that Lee Harvey Oswald did not, in fact, act alone -- that none other than Lyndon Johnson and military defense contractors were in fact behind the assassination? Not necessarily. But this movie intrigued me and scared me and got me to thinking, and that is really the highest compliment I can pay a Hollywood film. Most movies are interested in only one thing: money. This one is interested in ideas, enlightenment, and seeking out the truth. That alone makes &quot;JFK&quot; a rarity.<p>Besides all that, it's a terrific piece of filmmaking, period. I'm not a big fan of Oliver Stone, but what he pulled off here is remarkable. &quot;JFK&quot; feels like a combination of Hitchcock and Spielberg, with maybe a little Brian De Palma and Frank Capra thrown in. From the photography to the sound to the editing, it's a masterwork, vivid and alive. Though there is a lot of dialogue -- and two scenes that amount to soliloquies of Shakespearean depth -- Stone never bogs down, never loses steam, never loses his train of thought. The whole movie builds up to a climactic courtroom sequence that pulls all the threads together into a picture of what MIGHT have happened in Dallas that day. It then leaves us to think, and ask questions, and keep our own eyes open.<p>I want to mention three of the actors. First, Tommy Lee Jones, who is seductively evil as Clay Shaw/Bertrand. He deserved to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year, but of course there's no justice in that ceremony. Second, Joe Pesci, panicky and devilish as David Ferrie -- here's a whirlwind performance that dwarfs his fast-talking work in &quot;Lethal Weapon 2.&quot; Finally, Kevin Costner, turning in a powerful portrayal of Jim Garrison. Costner is in almost every scene, sometimes just watching and listening, but always credible in a role that took a lot of guts for him to play (after all, he is Stone's mouthpiece for a lot of highly unpopular ideas). Anyone who doubts Costner's acting ability has obviously never seen this film.<p>There are disturbing moments, many of them highlighted by pungent dialogue that gets right to the point. Donald Sutherland gets the movie's most gripping scene, walking Costner through all of &quot;the facts&quot; behind the assassination (it's a brilliant scene -- Garrison almost literally shuts down, he's so overwhelmed by what he's hearing). Lines like &quot;subtle as a cockroach crawling across a white carpet,&quot; &quot;it's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma&quot; and &quot;people like you just walk between the raindrops&quot; have a strangely chilling effect; simple lines that cast the drama in a sinister light.<p>Look, I realize that Stone altered some of the facts to fit his cinematic story (Ferrie, for instance, did not die under such suspicious circumstances). I know that the movie is not unbiased -- that it's a bald representation of the ideas of the man behind it. So what? Here is a movie that takes more risks than any other, before or since. It has flaws, but they are minor. &quot;JFK&quot; was the best film of 1991 and stands as one of my favorites ... disturbing though it may be.</p></body></html>

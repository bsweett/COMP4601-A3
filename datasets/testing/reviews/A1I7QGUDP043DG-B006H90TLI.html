A hard working man living in a trailer (played expertly by Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad while hunting, he's not prepared for the consequences of his actions when he takes the cash. This is no easy money for the battered war vet and a blood trail is soon left in the wake of his actions. Well deserving of the Oscar for Bardem and a film that will not soon be forgotten!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

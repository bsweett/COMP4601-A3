I agree with most other reviewers that this film was heavily mis-marketed. It was a romantic drama with comedic elements. This is what happens when you try to do something different in Hollywood. Where its true that Spanglish avoids a pat ending-I think this is the first time that I'm actually rooting for the hero to leave his wife. And its solely because James L. Brooks refused to give Tea any redeeming qualities. Simply put, her husband was way too good for her. Her confession of misbehaving and the subsequent tears felt like another level manipulation. She never asked or try to understand how her actions affected her husband--or how her actions affected anyone.  Yes, I understand this might very well reflect a certain level realism-but in the land of movies, characters, at some point in the storytelling, are suppose to have a character arc and change.  Take Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as it Gets (antoher James L. Brooks creation) All the characters change or grow during the course of the story.  In THIS story, everyone stays exactly the same--and in return-its an unremarkable journey.<br /><br />Mrs. C refused to the end to hold up a mirror to herself or bear any blame. Just when you think she's cornered-she then turns to her mother and say-this is all your fault. Even now, I'm thinking-this man chose to live the rest of days with this lunatic. He deserved better than that.<br /><br />Shelbie Bruce (daughter) was adorable-and I understand the sacrifice was his feelings for his family. But what type of family are we talking about when you have a looney, self-servant mom at the helm?<br /><br />I was rooting for Flor to show up that night, snatch her daughter back, and open a good old fashion can of whoop arse.  Now that's a level of realism I can deal with.<br /><br />Good film-but I wished for a better and more satisfying ending.</p></body></html>

Close to the end of "The Prestige," I asked myself "What's going on?" But the end had me saying "That's a great ending."  A lot of people are comparing "The Illusionist" to "The Prestige," due to the similar themes and time period.  Both movies have great casts, but for my money, I'd say The "Prestige" is playing for higher stakes.  "The Illusionist" is a wonderful movie, but it does tie everything into a nice neat and sentimental bow at the end.  "The Prestige" also has a tight ending, but when things come clear, it signals all kinds of dark undercurrents that had previously left the viewer mystified. Love, sacrifice, ambition, revenge, (real?) magic, illusion, the modern age, it's all there for you to ponder.  Oh, I was still left with plenty of muddy moments that would probably have me going back to rewatch the movie to seek further clarification, but the overall story is fairly clear.  One more comment, Christian Bale gives yet another great performance.  He has to be one of the most versatile actors in the business today.</p></body></html>

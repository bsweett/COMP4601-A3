I was supposed to get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OQCV2O">2012</a>, but oddly it was Law Abiding Citizen in the 2012 case. They sent me out 2012 when I reported the issue and I watched that first. Oy, what a mistake that was, because 2012 wasn't a Disaster Movie it was a movie disaster! Anyway...<br /><br />Law Abiding Citizen was a lot better than 2012. In fact as the movie played out, I thought to myself, "what a great movie." Even as the credits rolled I felt thoroughly entertained by the movie I had just watched. It had a lot of action, suspense, and it kept me guessing right up to the very end.<br /><br />Then as I reflected on the film I thought more about how silly the premise of the movie is and how far-fetched what the antihero (Gerard Butler) pulls off really is. I'd love to go into detail, but I'm struggling to do so without giving away the critical twists and turns of the movie.<br /><br />So let me just say this: with Law Abiding Citizen you get a pretty decent thriller about a guy (Butler) that you don't want to mess with who a couple home-invaders do indeed mess with. The bad guys get caught and Butler allows the DA (Jamie Foxx) to exact this great country's due process on the bad guys...which fails. So Butler sets a plan to take out the bad guys himself and anyone else that was involved in the failure of Due Process of Law.<br /><br />But man, the way this guy chooses to make his point, and the way he ultimately carries it out are where you'll be saying, "Hold on a second there." So check your brain at the door as I did, sit back and enjoy. It's like the small rollercoaster in the amusement park...it's fun while you're riding it, but after you get off you realize it wasn't that great.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cool Movie!"></head><body><p>I have had friends tell me they didn't like this movie because it seemed a little too fake, but I understood going into it that it was intended to seem that way...sort of in the 70s shock picture style, kinda like Rodriguez & Tarrentino's grindhouse picture movies Deathproof and Planet Terror.  It isn't exactly one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen, but I still thought it was pretty awesome...totally a guy movie.  If you can handle a bit of gore and some language & some full fledged nudity don't bother you, I definitely recommend giving this movie a watch...just watch it without the kids, because definitely not appropriate for their eyes and ears!  Beyond that though, this movie is pretty cool!  I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ASDFI6">Robert Rodriguez Mexico Trilogy (El Mariachi / Desperado / Once Upon A Time In Mexico)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SIPA4G">Sin City (Two-Disc Theatrical & Recut, Extended, and Unrated Versions) [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VMFWYI">Grindhouse (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RJ74">From Dusk Till Dawn (Dimension Collector's Series)</a></p></body></html>

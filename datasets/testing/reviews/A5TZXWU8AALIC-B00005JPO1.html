<meta name="summary" content="Between "Crusade" and "Temple of Doom""></head><body><p>(The review below is what I wrote after seeing the film for the first time.  Since then, I've seen it again and I have to say...it plays better a second time.  I think 20 years of anticipation really stokes up the expectations so high that no film can live up to it.  And this one didn't, at first.  Having already seen it once, I have to say that I could sit back and really enjoy it better the second time.  Weird).<br /><br />I'm sure opinions are going to be all over the place for this movie--it made over $300 million worldwide its first weekend so obviously a lot of people saw it!<br /><br />I saw it with a midnight movie crowd the night before it was supposed to open and most of the crowd were high school kids and two guys dressed as Indy.  There was no applause at the end and everyone shuffled out.<br /><br />Something seemed missing.<br /><br />They certainly threw enough onto the screen.  The opening sequence in Nevada set a good pace as a team of Soviet spies use a kidnapped Indy to storm Area 51 and retrieve an other-worldly artifact from the warehouse we last saw at the end of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The shot of Indiana Jones' silhouette walking up a hill as an atomic mushroom cloud fills the desert sky shows us the world has certainly changed since our hero battled Nazis all over the world.<br /><br />But the fun energy of the first film was missing.  It just wasn't fun after that.  And I don't mean that the filmmakers should've gone for cheap laughs or even ridiculous camp...but that spontaneous thrill from RAIDERS was gone.  It was never in TEMPLE OF DOOM and there were flashes in LAST CRUSADE.<br /><br />Although the whole extraterrestial angle was new and different, there were too many elements too closely tied to the earlier films.  There's no getting away from lost cities in jungles because, well, this is an Indiana Jones movie, but the finale felt like a rehash of RAIDERS.  The Ark of the Covenant was sufficiently explained so everyone could follow that ending.  But this time?  I'm guessing I know what happened and why, but did anyone lose count of how many crystal skulls were in play here?  The Russians nabbed one in Nevada and Indy got one in South America...but there was only one missing from the El Dorado temple, right?<br /><br />I also didn't care for the young guy character, Mutt.  He didn't look like James Dean or Marlon Brando, he looked like Screech from "Saved by the Bell" dressed up like Marlon Brando.  And his instant transformation from 50s punk to vine-swinging Tarzan nearly derailed the whole movie (I suspect that terrible CGI shot of him swinging with the CGI monkeys was only included in the latest round of ads is meant to take the sting of incredulous laughs from otherwise unsuspecting moviegoers).<br /><br />Very cool to see Karen Allen back.  (Now if we can only find out what happened to her character in ANIMAL HOUSE....)<br /><br />I remember reading how Spielberg assured everyone that the action wouldn't rely on computer special effects...but it looked like a LOT of computer special effects were used anyway, a real momentum killer for me anymore.  Most of the thrill of stuntwork was always the stunned belief that SOMEONE REALLY JUST DID THAT!  Until computers can trick us better, it's going to be hard to get us as excited as we used to be in movies.<br /><br />Some of the special effects shots were great though.  Since it's Spielberg and Lucas, you know you're seeing the best that money can buy.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't as bitterly disappointed as a lot of people were but I wasn't as excited and blown away as I was when I saw RAIDERS in the summer of 1981.  We were all a lot younger then.  And I can't blame this new production for trying.<br /><br />I'd rank them this way: TEMPLE OF DOOM was the worst, hands down.  Then this one.  Then LAST CRUSADE.  And still way out ahead, safely sitting way up on top is RAIDERS.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Performances, Questionable Character"></head><body><p>Despite its terrific performances and excellent pacing, "Erin Brockovich" proves most of all that no matter how trashy, foul-mouthed or self-absorbed a good-looking white woman is, she will always come out on top, especially if she stays abreast of her personal responsibilities. Roberts is perfectly cast as the titular (no pun intended) character, a 30-something ex-beauty queen with the mouth of a truck driver and the body of a Barbie doll, as well as its sense of responsibility. Down on her luck after two failed marriages (surprise), three kids (surprise) and no money in the bank (surprise), Brockovich hooks up with a broken down ambulance chaser (played marvelously by the always affable Albert Finney) following a car accident that may have been her fault. After practically extorting a job from Finney, she latches onto the plight of a California town, whose bumpkinish residents have been slow-poisoned by the local power utility. The movie wants to tell a David-and-Goliath story about a "common" woman taking on the big, bad corporation, but too often the motives of Brocovich get clouded by her self-indulgent behavior. For instance, she routinely dumps her kids on whoever will watch them, including a scary-looking but kind-hearted biker who just wants a girlfriend that's actually around. Though she claims her crusade is for the residents--she even seems to sacrifice her health for the case--ego seems more the impetus, as she basks in the adulation of the townspeople and takes generous swipes at anyone with a formal education, all while routinely running as far away from her own family as possible. And she expects a big check in the end from the very lawyers whose ethics she repeatedly condemns. What does that make her? I just don't buy into the cockeyed moral center of the movie, no matter how much gritty charm Roberts brings to the role. Ultimately, of course, Brockovich triumphs, but the movie makes it clear that it's her sexuality that open doors for her and not much else. True to life? Probably. But so is cancer. Doesn't mean I want it or need to see it.</p></body></html>

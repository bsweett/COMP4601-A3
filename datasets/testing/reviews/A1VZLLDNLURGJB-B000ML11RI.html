<meta name="summary" content="Sin City (2005)-Unique!"></head><body><p>Sin City (2005) After reading several Amazon reviews I saw there was no need to write another except to sign up as an additional uniquely satisfied customer. In the past I have been critical of films with too much explicit violence.  Not so in the case of Sin City which expressed its screen violence filtered through wonderful comic book images which were both realistic and surrealistic at the same time.  Very entertaining and interesting and I rate it at five stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Far better than the first; still short on character, story."></head><body><p>The first X-Men was a huge disappointment for me, the illustrious Marvel Comics characters rendered ultra-stylish but very flat because the film was spread out too thin over too many characters.  On X2, the story and writing became much tighter, but the characters are still a little more preoccupied with showing off their powers than developing emotional facets.  The result is another good-looking film, with good action sequences but not a great deal of emotional involvement.<br /><br />I still can't accept a majority of the casting choices.  Given one of the main subplots of this film is the legendary Jean Grey-Wolverine-Cyclops romantic triangle, it was a mistake on the writers' part to make Cyclops even less of a character than the rest of the cast.  Wolverine is still our main character, taking up the most screentime and with the most important arc, so making his rival Cyclops such a shallow shadow of a character was a fatal misstep.  Halle Berry as Storm is a disaster, projecting no sense of power, leadership, or charisma, perpetually stuck on an oh-pity-me expression; and Anna Paquin sleepwalks her way through another role.  As a person who is doomed never to be able to have human contact, Rogue needs much more anger and fire in her emotional spectrum, and Paquin barely manages to give us just a sad pubescent look.  The character problem, however, is less glaring than in the first X-Men film.  Hugh Jackman remains a joy to watch, even if he's still too young for the role of Wolverine, and Alan Cumming deserves the accolades he got as new character Nightcrawler, giving this film some much-needed humour and eccentricity.<br /><br />The story's been tightened this time, with a better script and dialogue, even though it still has the feel of a series of mutant-power (and CG-effects) showcases rather than a cohesive, progressive plot.  It's still a step up from the original in that this time I actually cared about what was going to happen next, whereas in the first one I just waited for the whole thing to be over.<br /><br />The ending of this film will set off alarm bells in X-Men fans; if they are indeed about to invoke the fabled "Dark Phoenix" plot, the next installment has the promise of being either the greatest comic-book film ever made, or a colossal dud that flunks the expectations.  Bryan Singer sets it up well at the end here, though I fear that if the thin characterizations of the first two X-Men films persist, then the emotional punch of the Dark Phoenix story may fail to come through.  One can only hope, though:  The Jean Grey-Wolverine relationship in the original comics was heartbreaking, dark and endearing at the same time; I certainly wish they would nail it on the next film.  In the meantime, X2 is good enough as entertainment, even if it's not particularly deep -- once again, a disappointing treatment of the characters of the X-Men comics, some of the most troubled and fascinating characters in comic-book history.</p></body></html>

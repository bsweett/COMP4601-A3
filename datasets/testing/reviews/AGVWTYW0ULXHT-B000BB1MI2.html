<meta name="summary" content="A near-perfect collaboration between the magic of Dahl's story and the gleeful imagination of Burton"></head><body><p>A wonderful expressionist realization of a story that, at bottom, is about the viciousness and wonder to which children are equally susceptible, and the culpability of parents in the failings of their children -- i.e. for the parents' failure to cultivate in their children a sense of wonder and a healthy respect for the unknown.  (That is why I think Burton's addition of the backstory regarding Wonka and his candy-hating dentist father is very much in the spirit of the original.)  The Dickensian world of Charlie is lovingly recreated by Burton, replete with a leaning shack and twisted doors that suggest the German expressionist techniques evident in the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  The Oompah Loompahs are perfect, and Tim Burton admirably avoids the racism implicit in the original story by making the Oompah Loompahs (all but a few, as far as I can tell, played by the same suave actor) without resorting to the campiness of the prior movie version, by making them much more clever than the rest of the characters in the story.  Their musical numbers had me and my children laughing out loud, especially where in the song for Mike Teavee they become a perfect parody of 70's glam rock (nearly besting even Spinal Tap in this brief number).  Tim Burton has his hits and misses, but this is definitely a big hit!</p></body></html>

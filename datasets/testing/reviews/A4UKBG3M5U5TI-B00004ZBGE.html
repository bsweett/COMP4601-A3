Roddy McDowall once again stars, this time as Caesar, the son of Cornelius (who he played in earlier films) and Zira.  Caesar is the only talking ape on Earth, although he's been hidden by circus owner Armando (Ricardo Montalban).  When Armando takes Caesar into public for the first time, he relates to Caesar how apes came to become the #1 pet in the country, which also serves as narration for the audience.  Apparently, a plague from space killed all the dogs and cats in the 1980s, and Americans turned to apes and other primates to replace them.  By 1991 when the film is set, though, humans essentially have turned primates into slaves, forcing them run errands, clean their homes, and even work as waiters in restaurants.  However, all of that will soon change once Caesar is discovered by the fascist Governor Breck.<br /><br />"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes" is weaker than the prior three movies in the series.  The final battle, in particular, is kind of ridiculous and suffers from the film's low budget; unfortunately, the weakness of this section undercuts the social message of the movie.  Another debit is the lack of explanation regarding how the US had become an oppressive society so quickly since the last Apes movie.  Incidentally, if you haven't seen the first three films, you probably will be totally lost, as "Conquest" is quite dependent on the Apes mythology.  Despite these weaknesses, "Conquest" is a relatively enjoyable movie.  What I found most interesting was how the makers of these movies managed to make each one different in plot and tone - "Conquest" wasn't just a rehash of the prior entries, preventing the series from falling into predictability.  Although I found "Conquest" to be rather lackluster, it was good enough to make me want to see the fifth and final Apes film, "Battle for the Planet of the Apes."</p></body></html>

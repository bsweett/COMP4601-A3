And then back again.  We do it as we get older and older, and then we develop heart disease, Alzheimer's, cancer, etc., and then die. And we've done a wonderful job of creating ornate illusions to make us think that we're doing something important, or at least worthwhile.<p>Office Space takes a nice poke at this illusion of meaning, as a modern day hero, with the help of a dying hypnotist, suddenly decides he just doesn't want to do anything.  And that he's thrilled to do nothing.  It makes him whole.  Complete.  Satisfied.  Of course, the last thing our culture wants is for someone to discover the joy of not keeping busy.  Busy work is the essence of our social order.<p>So, our hero stops taking life seriously, and wondrous riches, of sorts, land in his lap.  Can a person be happy without mindless, meaningless routine?<p>Why aren't there more movies like this?</p></body></html>

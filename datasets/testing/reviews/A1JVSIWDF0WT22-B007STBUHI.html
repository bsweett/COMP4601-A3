I've been waiting to see the complete 2 hour "Making-of" docuementary for years ! This Bonus feature, along with a price which by comparison to the original Laserdisc (over 100 dollars) is peanuts, might just be enough for me to forgive UNIVERSAL for not giving us all of this on the 25th. anniversary edition.<br /><br />Can't wait to buy this movie yet again, 3 Betas, 3 VHS's and 1 DVD later !</p></body></html>

David Yates took the fifth book (which a lot of people found too dark---I personally loved it) and made it work on screen.  One thing I am so pleased to have seen continue during the evolution of this popular film series is the ability to match directors to the books, who can capture the spirit and character of the story and translate it properly to screen.  Thankfully, for Potter fans everywhere, each film in the Harry Potter universe continues to improve and grow creatively.<br /><br />The fifth year starts with Harry in trouble after using a spell outside Hogwarts to save himself and his worthless cousin, Dudley, from a pair of Dementors.  After the resolution of this issue at the Ministry of Magic (in great part thanks to Professor Dumbledore, who defended Harry), the young wizard returns to Hogwarts to face one of his greatest challenges yet-----the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge.  Umbridge (played to the hilt by talented actress Imelda Staunton) is an evil and sadistic woman, who hides her cruelity behind shades of pink, a huge smile and the occassional slip of a high pitched giggle.  Dolores decides that it is time that Hogwarts return to an old school way of thinking and begins a campaign to change everything to her idea of higher education.  However, it soon becomes clear to Harry and his friends that Umbridge has no intentions of teaching real defensive techniques in class and the students form "Dumbledore's Army", a group meeting secretly in order to be prepared for the upcoming darkness of Voldemorte's return.<br /><br />Little by little, Umbridge takes control of Hogwarts and limits the freedom of students and teachers, eventually removing Dumbledore as Head Master.  Harry is angry at this point in his life and who wouldn't be?  Filled with raging hormones (and receiving his first kiss), dealing with a malicious teacher and constant nightmares, he lashes out at Dumbledore and even his friends.  His one constant is knowing that his godfather, Sirius Black is out "there" and will always help him in times of crisis.  Sirius, this time around, has help from the original surviving members of the Order of the Phoenix, which in the past included both Harry's and Neville's parents.  The living members include Nymphodora "Tonks", Mad-Eye Moody and Remus Lupin, among others--- all great charcters and well played (if seen too little) by the actors who portrayed them.  And, we got a glimpse of the insane and murderous Bellatrix LeStrange (Helena Bonham Carter, who is unfortunately in the film all to briefly!), Sirius Black's cousin, who escapes Azkaban and returns to do the Dark Lord's bidding.<br /><br />Of course, the story builds to the finale; a showdown with Voldemorte and his Death Eaters, pitted against members of the DA, the original Order and, of course, Dumbledore.  The fight scenes were great and I recommend seeing them in the IMAX theaters at least once for the 3-D effects.<br /><br />This movie is my favorite yet in the Potter series.  From new additions Helena Bonham Carter and Imelda Staunton to our old favorites, Dame Maggie Smith and Emma Thompson, for example, all the casting was perfect.  And I can't forget to mention the scene stealing Evanna Lynch who made Luna Lovegood one of my favorite characters in this film!!!  My only complaint would be seeing so little of Professor McGonagall (I loved the confrontation with Umbridge!), Bellatrix, Tonks, Mad-Eye and Dumbledore.  That said, I realize there is only so much time for a Hollywood production and some things must be edited out of an 800 page book for the sake of time!<br /><br />So, for all the Potter fans out there.....you must go see this latest addition in our beloved franchise!  For those of you who are not, do yourself a favor and catch this movie.  You won't regret it!  Highly recommended in a summer movie season where sequels have not managed to maintain the energy and creativity of their predecessors.</p></body></html>

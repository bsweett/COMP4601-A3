<meta name="summary" content="It is a good sign when the book author LOVES the movie!"></head><body><p>Miller was more than reluctant to see his novels (in comic book form) get made for the screen. After all, he'd worked long and hard to get his own series so why hand over the reins to someone else? Word is, he resisted tons of offers until finally he was convinced by a very persistent director, who went so far as to film a trial scene, complete with the ACTUAL ACTORS to be used in the movie. That did the trick.<br /><br />Okay, so that is a fine backstory but what about the film itself? Does it live up to expectations?<br /> Yes, and more so...just don't be surprised by the graphic nature of the film. Those familiar with Miller's work won't be - it is those who aren't who may have to make a few adjustments in their expectations, although I think they'll be entranced from the opening scenes.<br />  The plot is pretty much as you'd expect from a movie based on a Miller book. Murder, revenge, love, lust and corrumption everywhere. The world so gritty that you feel like showering after you leave the theatre, convinced the dust and grime are so thick that they HAVE to had escaped the screen. The film noir atmosphere is so thick that it makes for a heady experience, especially if, like me, you are a huge fan of film noir.<br /> If it sounds like I"m holding back on the plot details, I am..because viewers really need to come to this movie with fresh eyes, open to a new experience. You won't be disappointed but this movie won't be for everyone. Check out the word of mouth first, especially from people whose opinions you trust. My group loves this one.<br /><br />One of the most creative and innovative movies of the year, so far.</p></body></html>

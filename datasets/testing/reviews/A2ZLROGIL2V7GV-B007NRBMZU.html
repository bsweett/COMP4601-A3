<meta name="summary" content="&quot;You were happy once... with me.&quot;"></head><body><p>While &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; wasn't critically acclaimed or well loved by everyone, I thought it was a pretty good movie when I first saw it at the theatres.  It was a dark and completely disturbing film that made me want to look away at times, but at the same time I was very intrigued.  My only problem was the ending.  I thought it really contradicted the whole theme of the movie, but I always suspected that the so-called &quot;happy ending&quot; was forced upon since the movie is so dark and hard to watch that they thought there was no way people would like it if a more darker and depressing ending were added.  Well, now you get to see the director's cut of the film that's on this very DVD, which offers the superior ending.<p>Evan had terrible blackouts when he was little, very much like his father.  He would blackout during terrible situations and not remember anything.  That's when it was suggested to him that he keep a journal to see if he could remember what happened during those blackouts.  When Evan is all grown up, still haunted by his terrible past that had blanketed him and his friends, he discovers that he can relive those memories when he reads his entries.  He can view it like a movie and finally see what had happened during his blackouts.  Not only that, but he has the power to even alter those moments.  Determined to fix the pasts of him and his friends, he relives those memories and tries to fix them so they will all have a better future.  However, when he tries to change one thing, it leads to devastating results that he could have never foreseen.  As the cover says, &quot;Change one thing... change EVERYTHING.&quot;<p>I found this film to be very interesting and complex, even though I felt that the film itself was not perfect.  The movie is very hard to watch at times, so it's not recommended for those who don't like being disturbed or who are extremely sensitive to such matters.  I think it has a smart storyline and great acting.  Believe it or not, Ashton Kutcher is able to act in a serious role.  I didn't even recognize him at first, but he really pulled it off.  He was able to convince me that he was in fact &quot;Evan,&quot; as he played the role with determination and force.<p>As I said in the beginning, my major problem with the movie had always been the ending.  While it was happy and nice to see that things worked out considering the absolute hell this movie can put you through, I still found the ending to be contradictive and a &quot;cop-out.&quot;  Now, all of that's changed as you are given the choice to either watch the theatrical version, OR the director's cut.  The director's cut offers a few more extra minutes that adds more substance to the story (including an interesting find) and a more appropriate ending.  If you were to ask me which version is better, I'd say that the director's cut is without any hesitation  The new ending does a better job of fitting in with the theme of the movie and doesn't contradict the film as the theatrical ending does.  The DVD also offers &quot;infinifilm&quot; features that give you a deeper insight to the movie itself.  Extras included are commentary, documentaries, storyboard galleries and much more.  I must say that the film looks great, and also sounds fantastic as well.<p>&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; proves to be an even stronger film with the director's cut version, even if it's still not a perfect movie.  If you're looking for something a little more darker and sinister than your regular picks, then this is something to consider.  Just remember that this movie does not let you off easy.  It's brutal and extremely disturbing.  If you're daring and think you can handle it, then pick this up and prepare for one unforgettable and chilling ride. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

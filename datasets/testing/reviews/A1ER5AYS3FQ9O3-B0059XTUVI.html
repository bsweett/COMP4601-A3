<meta name="summary" content="Verdict? Streep, as always, spectacular. Movie? Yawn-worthy."></head><body><p>While I deeply wanted to love this movie, I instead felt mostly ambivalent about it.  Margaret Thatcher's younger self alternates with a portrait of her as dementia sets in (this is no spoiler but clear nearly from the outset of the film).<br /><br />This contrast of past and present can be effective - but not in this film. Streep musters on gamely and evokes Thatcher's character as much as possible within the limits of the script. I was frankly puzzled by how much of the film focused on Thatcher's decline and confusion rather than her most powerful moments in history. It seemed a waste.<br /><br />This isn't an absolute wreck of a film. Certain moments ring true. When Thatcher becomes prime minister  and walks through a sea of men, one feels for Thatcher. Streep conveys Thatcher's resolute nature and presence and her uncertainty about her chances of becoming prime minister. She has to be convinced this is actually possible when her stated goal is only to shake up things. .<br /><br />The movie is unfortunately quite slow and feels like a dull documentary instead of the riveting historical account it could have been. As my son and I watched it, he got very little feel for the history of the time and was left mostly with the impression of a confused older woman who had fleeting memories from her past.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Never get high on your own Supply"></head><body><p>The Hour is later than anybody thinks, amigo mio, and Tony Montana stands alone.<br /><br />He is besieged in the black-marble-and-gilt inner sanctum of his rapidly crumbling drug empire, and if you take a look-see over his shoulder at the roughly two-bazillion video security monitors you can see what appears to be the entire population of Bolivia doing the 5-minute-mile through Montana's living room---well, anyway, things don't look so good.<br /><br />But whatever. There stands Tony Montana (Al Pacino, sinking entirely into the skin of what is without a doubt one of the biggest bada**es of movie history), snarling defiance, all enraged animal aggression, snorting a few million bucks of his own Bolivian white and ready to go to war, armed for bear with a fully locked-and-loaded streetsweeper, complete with grenade launcher!<br /><br />And seeing as he has a few unexpected late-night visitors, he's way into Introduction Mode.You know, inviting his gate-crashers to say hello to his Little Friend, and all.<br /><br />You know, the Little Friend with the handy-dandy grenade-clip accessory, for those Close Encounters.<br /><br />How did it all come down to this? How did Montana's burning desire for his own little steaming slice of the American Dream get so, well, messy?<br /><br />Whatever the case, be warned: "Scarface" attained its cinematic infamy largely because of two unforgettable scenes that just drip with insanity.<br /><br />Boiled down to its guts, "Scarface" is a flick anchored at one end by a chainsaw in the shower and a heavy-machinegun and a mountain of coke on the other. In the middle we'v got a big, long, endless desert of stylish but lethargic white noise in the middle. And at the end of the day, puzzlingly, "Scarface" is a major downer.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I love "Scarface", relish it, probably for all the wrong reasons. I went so far as to get the Deluxe Super-Duper Special Edition all packaged up in a fake gator-skin case with a lining of red velvet, making you want to do a double-take to make sure you didn't leave the silencer attachment to the 9MM FN Browning rolling around inside the box.<br /><br />So now that we've got my "Scarface" street creds out of the way, let's just face up to facts: Brian De Palma's druglord epic sprawls, sweats ambition, has a lot of really cool "chit" going for it.<br /><br />It has great, supple acting: Pacino chews up every inch of the landscape as Montana, exuding this raw, furious energy, and bloodlust and drive and this curious, weird, endearing integrity---or maybe even naivete---that helps him ascend, muy rapido, into the counsels of first one drug kingpin (Robert Loggia, playing it down a notch) and then another (the great Paul Shennar, playing it like Ricardo Montalban with a straight-razor tucked up one of his Cerruti-clad wrists).<br /><br />A very young Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira Hancock) is all withering barbs, sultry-bored looks, and coked-up emaciated allure; Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina, Tony's sister and one of the many objects of his jealous, crazed attention) is perky and all, but for some reason gives me the creeps---ditto for Wayne Doba (formerly the monster in Tobe Hooper's "Funhouse") as the weird-as-batsh*t Octavio the Clown. Yech. Was anyone else besides me relieved when that weird, fat little b*stard took a dirt nap?<br /><br />Steven Bauer as Manny is completely believable, and completely doomed. And F. Murray Abraham might very well have opened up one of the final Seals to Armaggedon by merely appearing in this flick as whiney gangster Omar Suarez, tempting ridicule and the Last Days by baring his sparse chest-hair in one of those seventies disco-fever-number silk shirts. Blech. Seeing him doing a hangman's tapdance from a hovering jet ranger was goofy cool.<br /><br />So is "Scarface" a great movie, one for the ages, worthy of all its hip-hop street creds and gangsta aplomb? I guess it goes two ways: it's a classic for me, and I love it in spite of all its warts. But it does have warts.<br /><br />Now: "Scarface"has those two unforgettable scenes, a character I can truly dig, a surface theme I happen to agree with (you have to carve out your own destiny in blood, sweat, toil and tears), and a generous slathering of cheesy cool---but I think I know why, ultimately the flick rubs me the wrong way.<br /><br />I think Brian De Palma wanted to make a morality play about how having it all, having all the money in the world, really being able to wallow in the truth of "The World is Yours"---well, Esse, at the end of the day it ain't all that. He tries to do with Tony Montana---who I want to see win, and so do you, stop lying---what Oliver Stone did with Gordon Gekko in "Wall Street".<br /><br />That's why "Scarface" feels off, somehow: the flick zags when, dammit, you want it to zig. It's right, it makes sense, that Montana would whack Castro's toady Rebenga and then brag to Loggia about it being fun; it's right that Montana takes a no bullsh*t approach and drives his way right into druglord Alejandro Sosa's heart of darkness.<br /><br />It's right, it's in character, that Montana, in the grip of utter contempt, puts down his former mentor Frank Lopez (Loggia) like a sick, fat, egg-s*cking dog.<br /><br />But come on: would the Montana we know and love every really agonize over sending a couple of squawling brats, ultimately executing the assassin with extreme prejudice and sealing his own fate? Would he really take lip from his mealy-mouthed, money-laundering banker, or would he introduce the interfering little c*bron to his Little Friend? Would he really get all henpecked by Elvira, finally dissolving into a puddle of drug-addled futility? Would he really blast long-time amigo Manny for getting jiggy with Gina?<br /><br />Of course not. But it's a morality tale: what profit it a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?, and all.<br /><br />So yeah, we've got a big bottle of Crystal, but the grapes are rotten; we've got a silver tin of caviar, but it's been out in the sun for a week; we've got a Rolls Royce Phantom with a V4 engine. So Tony Montana slouches down into the bubbles of his marble soaking tub, snapping at Manny and Elvira and pretty much anyone who comes into periscope range, with that livid look snarls "is that all there is?"<br /><br />Or maybe I'm reading too much into it. Maybe the real lesson of "Scarface" is this: if you're gonna doublecross a brutal Bolivian drug-lord and his army of whacked-out M16 wielding zombies, you'd better spend a little of that fortune hiring some muscle besides Chi-Chi and Nick the Pig.<br /><br />Or maybe it's more like this: what profit it a man to gain the whole world if he doesn't have any damned fun afterwards?<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

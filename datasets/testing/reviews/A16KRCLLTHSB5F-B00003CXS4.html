Watching Snatch for the first time is to be jerked around (and hopefully entertained somewhat) by its elaborate but ultimately meaningless plot. To the watch it for the second or third time is to hang out with your old pals Turkish and Bullet-Tooth Tony, and to notice the little details of their performances which make their characters so vivid and endearing. Maybe not everyone will fall in love with this cast of thieves and murderers, but I think the reason for the comedic nature of the movie, whether Richie intended it or not, is to make it easier to relate to and sympathize with the characters. Someone else, hearing me describe the film, wondered if _any_ of the characters could be sympathetic, but in the end I think that all of them are. Even Brick Top. As Richie relates in the 'making of' documentary: 'I wanted him to be a character that people genuinely disliked...and I thought What do people really hate, and the first thing that came to mind was paedophiles. But my Brazilian cameraman pointed out to me...In England, molesting children is one thing, and torturing dogs is another. So I decided to have him torture dogs. And it was supposed to make the audience dislike him, but I found it had rather the opposite effect.' Indeed, seeing Brick Top's cheerful, earnest grin as he pokes a sharp stick between the bars of a dog's cage makes it awfully hard to dislike him. He loves his work.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Light your cigar with a wooden match, it preserves the flavor"></head><body><p>This movie has many subtle points that might evade the viewer.  For example Jeffrey Tabor's boss man, like Ron Perlman's Hellboy, is always smoking a cigar.  It is not until close to the end of the movie that the two develop some regard for the other, after having to work closely together in dangerous circumstances.  It is the short exchange between the two on the subject of cigars that indicates that they have finally come to understand one another somewhat.  Tabor's character shows Hellboy that he should light his cigar with a wooden match "to preserve the flavor".  In reply Hellboy actually says "thanks"!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I wasn't familiar with the book,still aren't, film is fascinating"></head><body><p>I am a fan of the Watchmen movie, preferably the 'Director's Cut' version.<br />Because I wasn't familiar with the source material , I could watch the film without preconceptions.<br />I first watched it without the sound on, just reading the subtitles.<br />Sleeping babies can affect your movie watching capabilities. I was able to take in purely the visual aspect of it - on that basis alone, the film succeeded for me.<br /><br />Hearing it with the sound on changes the emotional tone completely - it is even more dramatic. I do wonder how it would have been with hardly any music. It does not need much.<br /><br />Now, after watching the Director's Cut a few more times, I've begun to make more sense of it. I realise that the film is all about people who are coming to terms with their lives and that some are not afraid to make drastically dangerous decisions, without concern for morality. For this reason, it can be a hard film to sit through. There are periods in the film (such as the trip to another planet) where two of the characters talk and one of them mentions how it is so scientifically fascinating that a person is born - the event of life creation is described in beautiful language. The scene has a great sadness and weight to it, seeming somehow timeless.<br /><br />At the same time, the film has some quite violent sections. I hope this gives you an idea of how much is going on in it.<br /><br />All the actors fit their roles incredibly well, the world of the movie is believable, effects work seamlessly and overall it is an offbeat and rather long movie - demanding is an accurate word.<br />It is very dark and explores failure as a theme, similar to 'The Dark Knight'. Perhaps part of the reason the film got made is good timing - 'The Dark Knight' was very successful and took the superhero movie somewhere else.<br /><br />I recommend you rent it to see what you think of it - whether you look at the source material is up to you.<br />If you find yourself intrigued by the film, you will likely then need time to watch it again as you felt able to 'take it in' over several viewings, which is what worked for me.<br />You could call it a drama with a comic book aspect or vice versa.<br />I'm glad it got made and that it has caused such intense scrutiny.<br />I don't plan to read the source material - after all, some of us just want to see the film, not read the book.<br />What a film it is.</p></body></html>

If the film's final 30 minutes don't discourage you from a life of drugs and addiction, then you are simply insane.  A great, career-reviving performance from Ellen Burstyn, and Jaerd Leto and Marlon Wayans are in top form as well.  The DVD has features galore, including a commentary, interviews, trailers, and a making-of featurette.  Not for the fainthearted.</p></body></html>

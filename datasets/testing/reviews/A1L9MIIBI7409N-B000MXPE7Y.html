<meta name="summary" content="The Bittersweet Spy"></head><body><p>This is a well made film, unfortunately overlooked despite its star ensemble cast and production. Clocking in at 168 minutes, it probably would have made a better mini series.  Robert DeNiro does a great job directing this.  However the casting of Matt Damon as a man who gives his life up for the CIA was perhaps not the most inspired choice.  I agree it's hard to empathise with him, but I saw that as the limitations of Matt Damon's acting abilities.  Taciturn and not particularly expressive, Matt Damon also hardly ages much across the decades that this film spans - he's too constant and thus never progresses as a character.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the movie is engaging - even though it could have benefitted from more tension.  As it is, the DVD's deleted scenes reveal entire sequences that would've made the movie even longer.  Given the film's multiple subplots, leaving these scenes out didn't hurt.  To sum up, The Good Shepherd plays/ reads like a book, and for those confused about the plot...watch it with subtitles.  The ensemble cast makes it worthwhile - Angelina Jolie does a great job as does William Hurt, John Turturro, Alec Baldwin, and everyone else.<br /><br />DeNiro may have been trying to channel his Cold War version of the Godfather here, but this is a slow burn and Damon is no Pacino.  Still, a sterling movie and monumental effort from a screen legend.</p></body></html>

Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls is funny, highly entertaining and surprisingly exciting! Personally I think the best entry into this series was, is and always will be Temple of Doom so I really wasn't expecting this to top that in any way, which it didn't, but it did however come awful close to topping what I felt was the weakest entry, The Last Crusade. Not by all that much though. Both had their strengths and weaknesses, both are exciting but Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls had the benefit of falling back on CG environments and action sequences, The Last Crusade did not.<br /><br />It was great to see Karen Allen return to this entry and, despite not being the biggest fan of his work, I felt Shia LeBeouf really did do a decent job as rebellious greaser Mutt Williams but ultimately this is all about Harrison Ford, am I right? Ford's presence was 100% necessary to make or break this film and thankfully I feel the film worked quite well without actually upping the ante. He came, he saw, he kicked ass and that appears to have been the intention all along, give the fans what they want and give `em lots of it. We weren't offered much of a glimpse into Indie's between film relationship with Marion, just a failed engagement, but there is indeed a shocker awaiting those of you that don't see it coming the first 25 minutes of the film.<br /><br />I've heard a few complaints about this film ranging from the CG gophers to the outlandish story, and I certainly agree with the goofy gophers, but I'll be damned if this concept isn't any more or less outlandish than a magical box, magical stones and a magical cup. C'mon folks, withdraw that stick from you know where and have fun with this entry! This was entertaining as heck and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. Perhaps it "could have been better" but what film couldn't be?</p></body></html>

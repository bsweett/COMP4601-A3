<meta name="summary" content="Christopher Reeve's Superman is reborn!"></head><body><p>The Man of Steel is back!  Superman Returns is visually stunning, taking advantage of all the latest technology to make the story believeable, the settings real looking and true to the comics.<br /><br />More than that, the film recasts the hero in the mold set by Christopher Reeve.  Unlike the Batman films, where there is no continuity of character after Batman Returns, Superman Returns does as good a job as possible of picking up the story where it left off with the last Christopher Reeve film, at least in terms of the Superman character.  In the film moreso than the promotional material, Brandon Routh bears a striking similarity to Mr. Reeve's Superman.  He even sounds like him and did a great job of copying Reeve's Clark Kent twitches, eyebrow-raises and awkwardness.*<br /><br />There is no continuity with the rest of the characters.  Kate Bosworth, as Lois Lane, is cute but lacks the sassiness of Margot Kidder's Lois.  Frank Langella's Perry White lacks the crabbiness of Jackie Cooper's portrayal.  Jimmy Olsen is, well, still Jimmy Olsen.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is a great villain and does a fine job as Lex Luthor.  He's brilliant and clearly evil.  But his portrayal lacks the charm and fun brought to the part by Gene Hackman.  Perhaps this is the script and not the actor.<br /><br />All in all, Superman Returns is darker, less light-hearted than the previous Superman films.  Gone are the one-liners and bits of comic relief.  In their place are more pieces of the love quadrangle between Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Superman and Lois's current love, Richard White (Perry's nephew.)  Lois, now a mother, has her heart tugged in three different directions after Superman returns (thus the title) from a five year hiatus from planet Earth.<br /><br />Superman Returns is a fun film.  Though darker, there was little killing (mostly bad guys being crushed by heavy objects.)  It may not be appropriate for smaller kids, but it is family-friendly if your children are older.  One caution for those with more traditional values: Lois has a child out of wedlock and lives, unmarried, with Richard.  That is presented tastefully, however.<br /><br />*[While Routh's recreation of the Christopher Reeve Superman is masterful, it may be a detriment to his career in the long run.  Rather than bringing his own interpretation of the character to the screen, Routh simply imitates -- again, probably what the writers, director and producer wanted -- Reeve playing Superman.  He's good at it, to be sure, but it is hard to imagine what he has shown to people looking at him for another (non-Superman) part.]</p></body></html>

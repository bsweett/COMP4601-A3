<meta name="summary" content="he should have just stayed where he was"></head><body><p>The adventure is acceptable enough, but what's with the adultery theme?<br /><br />This outing sees Lois Lane virtually married to another man.  Nevertheless, the Man of Steel (whom I had thought above such things), uses his X-ray vision to spy on her, leer at her, hold her, take her for unsupervised romantic night flights, etc.  Would you still feel okay watching this if Lois were your wife?<br /><br />Yeah, something was not right about this.  This whole thing gave me an uncomfortable feeling because you got the idea that Superman was wrongly trying to reclaim fields he had forsaken.<br /><br />Another bummer was the script never really let Kevin Spacey take off like you know he could have.</p></body></html>

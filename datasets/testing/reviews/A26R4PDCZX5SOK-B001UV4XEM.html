<meta name="summary" content="Where did the live chicken come from??"></head><body><p>5 of 5 stars for the comedy The Hangover. Let's see, take four guys (one to get married in two days), add Las Vegas, some drugs, shake well and you end-up the next day in a hotel suite with strippers, a tiger, a trashed room, a missing mattress, a missing front tooth, a live chicken and a missing bride groom. What's the problem? Noone remembers what happened--nothing, nada, zip. This movie is about the quest to learn what happened last night--and to find Douggie (the bride groom). The three remaining guys set-out to unwind the nights events, including a trip to a wedding chapel, discovery of a new wife (former stripper) for one of the three guys and a visit to the home of Mike Tyson (the boxer). This is a very funny movie with extreme moments and odd ball surprises. Two buckets of nuked popcorn are a must for this funny movie! Well made, extremely well written (who thinks of this stuff??) and really fun to watch. OK, a spoiler (not): Where did the live chicken in the hotel room come from??? They never explained that one. I highly recommend this movie; however, it is for mature audiences, lots of adult stuff. Oh, the infant found in their hotel room was a professionally trained stunt baby, so noone was hurt.</p></body></html>

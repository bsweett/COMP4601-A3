<meta name="summary" content="The dead arise to devour the living..."></head><body><p>The horror classic which inspired such other subsequent classics such as 'Dawn of The Dead' and 'Day of The Dead'. A truly dark presentation both aesthetically, literarily, and literally.<br /><br />Radiation has cause the dead to rise and hunt the living for sustainance. A few people turn a house into a fortress to shield themselves for the carnivorous advances of the walking dead. Veritable ghouls who seek to consume living flesh.<br /><br />Personalities and wills conflict within the fortress, which eventually leads to the necessary murder {execution} of one of the inhabitants, followed by his family, who all subsequently arise, but are dispatched by the resident leader of this desperate and frightened troop. One tribulation after another, they battle valiantly against the zombies to protect the living, only to be shot square in the forehead by what would have been their rescuers, who mistook him for a ghoul. A dark ending to a dark film.<br /><br />This film is devoid of the typical 'happy ending' pollyanna scenario propagated by poop-culture, which is actually why, I believe it made such a cinematic impression that inspired a genre from filming technique to the plot.</p></body></html>

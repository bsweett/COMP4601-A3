<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>The curator of the Louvre in Paris is murdered in the museum, leaving behind a series of cryptic messages for an American author and expert on symbols and ciphers. Along with the curator's granddaughter, a French policewoman, they must follow the clues while evading the police to uncover a secret that would change 2000 years of Christian history.<br /><br />Having read the book and enjoyed it, I was very disappointed in the movie. Maybe is just wasn't meant to be a film. There is a lot to explain as the story line moves along and Dan Brown was able to make it informative and exciting on the page. Unfortunately on the screen these scenes are long and dull. The movie on a whole was too long and for a thriller had very few thrills. The whole mood just didn't work, making everything happen too slowly to really engage the viewer. Even Tom Hanks, one of the best actors in the world, was not good in this movie. The only person that escapes unscathed is Ian McKellan who gave a believable, fanatic performance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clever satire"></head><body><p>One of the many ironies in this blatant satire (which is NOT a documentary) is that at no time is anybody seen smoking!  No Hollywood cinematic light ups.  Even Nick Naylor, who is vice president of the smoking PR conglomerate, does not actually light up on screen.  We see him once look into an empty pack of cigarettes wishing he had one, that's it.<br /><br />The joke on the square is that although this movie is about smoking nobody associated with the movie wants to be accused of supporting smoking in any way.  Now you might think that, well, a movie that puts smoking in a bad light as this movie does, certainly is not what the tobacco companies want to see.  However, if the movie producers also threw in a few scenes with the stars puffing happily away, the message would surely be mixed.<br /><br />No mixed messages here.  Aaron Eckhart who stars as Nick Naylor is a sort of charming sociopath.  He describes himself as the kind of guy who could get any woman into bed.  In an relentlessly ironic follow up to that we have Katie Holmes playing an intrepid reporter for the "Washington Probe" newspaper who gets him into bed, all the better to get him to reveal all his dirty secrets and dirty tricks.  He was owned, so to speak, and taken advantage of sexually.<br /><br />Eckhart is perfect for the part with his handsome winning ways.  You may recall that he played a corporate sexist pig sociopath in the critically acclaimed film In the Company of Men (1997), which I highly recommend.  (See my review.)  Here he is a little sweeter, a little more charming, and amazingly enough a good role model for his son Joey (Cameron Bright), who, by the way, has a lot of sharp lines and delivers them well.  How this is pulled off is something to behold, for sure.  But basically the rationale is that Nick is doing it all "to pay the mortgage" ("the yuppie Nuremberg defense") and that is the lesson that Joey learns, and presumably he will be able to adapt to more socially correct employment when he grows up.<br /><br />Some satirical bits include the Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott) with cancer getting a bribe; a senator from Vermont (William H. Macy) holding a senate hearing about getting a skull and crossbones logo put on cigarette packages while Nick tells him that the Vermont cows and their cheese are causing clogged arteries and heart attacks; Nick hanging out with a RP person representing the interests of alcohol (Maria Bello), and another (David Koechner) whoring for the gun industry.  They like to sit around over dinner and compare the number of people their products have killed.<br /><br />Robert Duvall has a modest part as the "Captain" of tobacco and Rob Lowe gets to play Jeff Megall, a big time, Machiavellian Hollywood money man, who is lining up Catherine Zeta-Jones and I forget who, to play a naked in a space movie with some serious smoking scenes--for a price to be paid for by Big Tobacco.  The joke here is that this practice has long been a source of Hollywood film production up-front revenue.  There's a scene showing old Hollywood stars with PC touch ups of their movies, showing them with lolly-pops or pencils hanging out of their mouths instead of cigarettes.<br /><br />The script (adapted from a novel by Christopher Buckley, son of conservative pundit William F. Buckley) and direction by Jason Reitman deserve some kind of award for originality.  The film is definitely a put down of industry PR people, yet somehow it makes them look human.</p></body></html>

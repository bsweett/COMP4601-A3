It took me a while to get around to it, but I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I normally let Amazon's own "Editorial Review" slide by, but Robert Horton's is so laughably ignorant that it's worth mentioning. I sure hope they didn't pay him for it, unless it was a plugged nickel. He refers to the werewolves as all CGI when in fact they are beautiful real masks/suits and make-up by perhaps the greatest creature/powder guy in cinematic history, Rick Baker. Nice eye, Robert! What an expert. He also makes no mention of Elfman's exemplary score or Hopkins' wonderfully edgy performance, but of course makes sure to take the opportunity to dis Van Helsing, de rigueur amongst monster fans with zero sense of humor or irony, which VH was hilariously laden with. That half-blind fanboys like Horton are so insistent on comparing all new Universal efforts with the originals only highlights the strengths of this solid reworking of the original Wolfman.<br /><br />While that first lycanthropic gem certainly is classic, it also has its share of hokey moments, and for me there were few of those in this new version. It's no masterpiece, but I found it surprisingly enjoyable. It's gorier than the 1941 version, but not gratuitously. It's got its share of scares, but they worked organically for me and rarely seemed cheesy. I expected a lot more cheese here, actually, and even Del Toro held up well, no mean feat when compared to Chaney. Hopkins is just as good as Rains as Talbot Sr. in his own way, remolding the role to suit himself and coming up with one of his best scary takes since the original Hannibal. Weaving almost steals the show; as in The Matrix, he's the perfectly imperfect cop, and really knows how to make you both loathe and feel for his character. He's due for a major breakout role, as he sure is a fine actor.<br /><br />I also liked the rewrite; Von Sydow's mysterious donation of the silver cane is a fine touch, and many of the other new details work well. Rather than ape the original, director Johnston makes his own film and in its own way I think it holds up just as well. I loved the foreboding darkness throughout, and on blu-ray the various black depths come to life. The lighting is suitably dramatic and while there's little of Van Helsing's self-mockery, there are moments of sly humor that surprised me. Johnston uses the medium to great advantage; the tight cuts and quick flashes as the wolf enters into Talbot's system are excellent, and I the transformation scenes realistic and are as good as any I've seen.<br /><br />The BD has a tight transfer as well as many extra features, with some good interviews with the stars, a wonderful piece showing how Baker created his own version of the werewolf, and various other enjoyable shorts.<br /><br />I expected little from this film given its weak reception, but a reviewer whose opinion I respect here (certainly not Horton's!) wrote well about how decent it was, and I'm glad I read his review. That's why I find this site so useful: I can reliably trust those who share my tastes on other films, and use them to find films I would otherwise never have watched. And I can also happily ignore people who don't even know the difference between CGI great make-up and prosthetics.<br /><br />If you enjoy the dark foreboding feel of Victoriana in the Rathbone Holmes and many of the great old monster films, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by this version of The Wolfman. I sure was. And as always, be sure to watch it at night with all the lights out!</p></body></html>

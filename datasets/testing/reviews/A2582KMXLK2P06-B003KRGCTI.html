It's about a man who has invincible (or rather, nearly invincible) super powers as a result of a book he carries around with him everywhere he goes.<br /><br />He also contains super human strengths apparently, whether because of the book or just because the movie writers needed to make something exciting happen in order to entertain the viewers- I don't necessarily know which one it is.<br /><br />Anyway, he travels across deserted lands telling everyone he meets that he's travelling west, until he ends up coming across a group of power hungry smalltown thugs who would like nothing more than to take the book away from him once they discover he's carrying it.<br /><br />The entire storyline consists of the man trying his very best to protect the book and keep it away from those who don't know how to handle its power.<br /><br />I really like the gloomy setting that takes place throughout the movie.  It's always exceptionally bleak and succeeds in delivering the scenery of a post-apocalyptic world perfectly.  The grey clouds, the eerie silence, the emptiness... just a frighteningly realistic scenario.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good for the most part, however my only complaint is that the storyline wasn't strong enough to keep me attached.  There's only so much you can talk about when the storyline pertains to protecting a book with special abilities.<br /><br />However some of the shooting and fighting segments were really good, my favorite being the shoot-out at the one house resulting in a portion of the house literally being blown apart.  I loved this part.<br /><br />Overall, the Book of Eli is a pretty good film.  It's easy to follow, and the action segments are pretty strong.</p></body></html>

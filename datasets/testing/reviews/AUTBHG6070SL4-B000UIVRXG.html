In appearance, he looks a bit like Daniel Craig's James Bond. And, like Bond, Angel seems to be master of every skill a person could name - the list of achievements becomes ludicrous after a while. Then we see official recognition and reward for his single minded dedication. The department promotes him to sergeant, and ship him out to a sleepy little village halfway to nowhere. He was making the rest look bad.<br /><br />The village of Sandford probably hasn't changed since Elizabethan times, and like it that way. It's peopled by enough eccentrics for a brace of britcoms, but utterly peaceful - at first glance. Oh, there are a few alcohol-related incidents, but the Neighborhood Watch turns apoplectic at the first stroke of grafitti or street performer. Then people start dying in bloody ways under bizarre circumstances. And, for some reason, the population and even the police detectives seem happy with any convoluted logic that can explain the deaths away as accidents. But Angel knows there's more --<br /><br />-- and saying more would say too much. You just have to see the rest for yourself. All the town's weirdness comes to a head, and bursts like a boil of social corruption. It includes the most laugh-out-loud running gun battle I've ever seen. It also satirizes the extremes of small-town pride, which only seems to grow larger as the reasons for pride grow smaller.<br /><br />Viewers with sensitive stomachs might find some of the mayhem a bit gory. That aside, it's skewed look at stereotypes that deserve to be skewered. After a slightly slow start, it had me rolling. Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

This time terrorists have hacked into everything that is "hackable" and threaten to bring the United States to its knees.<br />Bruce Willis, Justin Long, Maggie Q (!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.  Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.<br />The only major setback (as in the case of Next, The Legend of Zorro and other movies) is in relation to those "geniuses" that came up with the French-speaking Europeans as villains and with no explanation whatsoever as to their motive!  It's not as if there aren't enough prospective terrorists out there, they're lining up for crying out loud, so why go with some of the most unlikely candidates?<br />What European would even bother???<br />Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the special effects are all very good.<br />In conclusion, Die Hard 4 is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection, especially if you are a Bruce Willis fan.</p></body></html>

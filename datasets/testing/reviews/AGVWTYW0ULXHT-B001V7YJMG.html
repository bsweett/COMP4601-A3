<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful, haunting and mesmerizing coming-of-age (with Swedish vampires) story"></head><body><p>Oskar is a lonely and disturbed young man, living with an alternately distant and overprotective mother, whose loving but alcoholic father has left them.  He is bullied at school, and Oskar imagines what it would be like to frighten his torturer as he has been frightened.  Then he meets Eli, an apparently odd but pretty young woman who moves next door, who turns out to be something altogether different.  The relationship that develops is both extremely touching and utterly disturbing.  The film touches upon themes that are at the heart of the Showtime series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUW0">Dexter</a>, but with a tenderness that reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087EY5">My Life as a Dog</a>.  It is a completely unique cinematic experience (a nice alternative to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P5HRMI">Twilight</a>), well worth watching, and that must be seen more than once to catch the most intriguing elements.<br /><br />This astonishing film deserves to be seen widely, far beyond the "cult film" and even "arthouse" audiences that have been wowed by it in theaters.  Here's hoping that with a newly subtitled version on dvd and Blu-ray (it is unclear whether the announced update is what you'll get when you buy it through Amazon), this film will find the mainstream audience it deserves.  It is, by far, the most moving scary movie I've ever seen - for its unique combination of innocence and dread, the only precedent I can think of might be the fascinating <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000035P5R">The Night of the Hunter</a>.  The atmosphere of the film is perfect, the story is gripping, the acting is brilliant, the cinematography is powerful (capturing the point of view of children, and attending precisely to the details necessary to tell the story without superfluous imagery, lit to just the right levels to create a stark contrast between day and night).  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

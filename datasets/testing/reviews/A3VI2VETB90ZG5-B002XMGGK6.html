<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable - But Over the Top"></head><body><p>Are you ready to suspend your disbelief? You're going to have to because this one is so remarkably out there.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, as anyone looking for a new thriller may, but don't look for much replay value unless you're into watching the gore over and over - it's a one-trick pony, but it's very captivating and was able to keep me up after work from 2:00am to almost 3:40am with its sufficiently fast pace for my first viewing on my laptop of this suspenseful title.<br /><br />There are a couple of good gotcha moments, complimented with a scene that you can obviously tell what's going to take place. It's a nice, silly mix.<br /><br />Oh, and why do the burglars always go for the candle sticks first? Classic!<br /><br />In its defense, no pun intended, I'm sure this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a good thing. "Law Abiding Citizen" is put together nicely for what it is and everyone gives a fine performance.<br /><br />Though not for the squeamish, If you can't stand the criminal justice system, then you'll love this far-fetched, thriller!</p></body></html>

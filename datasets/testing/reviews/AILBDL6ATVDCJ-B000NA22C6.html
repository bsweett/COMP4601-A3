<meta name="summary" content="The Depp Man Does It Again"></head><body><p>Secret Window is a great film, loaded with so many well-directed scenes I wished it had been a longer movie.  The movie is based on a Stephen King novel (Four Past Midnight - Secret Window - Secret Garden), and while I haven't read that novel, this movie has convinced me to do just that.<p>Depp is a master at getting inside the role he plays, and being a writer myself, and having a lot of writer-friends, I can tell you that Depp did a great job portraying a successful writer in this movie.  But Depp fans are used to him delivering the goods, aren't they?  Yes would be the correct answer... <p>It is Johnny's little quirks and piffy comments, that one would swear had to be Depp's own toss-ins, which make this movie so easy to love.  When the young woman at the post office tells him he looks pale and he responds, "thanks", the dialogue flowed so well it seemed like a camera man had caught the two just having a daily conversation without them knowing they were being filmed; now that's acting.<p>The plot is great.  I didn't have a hard time figuring out where the movie was taking me, but it managed to make a figured-out-early-plot still ride quite nice.  There are a lot of scary parts, a lot of supenseful parts, and some really cool twists in this suspense - thriller.<p>The beginning of the movie grabs you - with Johnny Depp's character being accused of plagiarism by a very strange fellow.  What follows is a scary thriller sure to make you think.<p>Buy this film!  You won't be sorry!<br />See ya next review.<br />(...)</p></body></html>

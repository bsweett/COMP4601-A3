<meta name="summary" content="a Grimm tale..."></head><body><p>A couple of weeks ago, I went out to see The Brothers Grimm.  It's a Terry Gilliam film, the well-known director of films such as Brazil and Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  With such an illustrious past, Gilliam has much to live up to.<br /><br />With this effort, he's gone a little more mainstream, and a little more linear.  This is not to say that the movie is bad--it's not.  It's just that it's a little more normal than Gilliam fans would have expected.<br /><br />The movie tells the tale of two brothers, last name Grimm, who roam the German countryside, scamming unsuspecting small towns who are "haunted" or "betwitched" or somesuch, with said calamities actually created by the Grimms and their compadres.  Unfortunately for the Grimms, they've been caught by the government, and set the task of un-cursing a small town which, the government believes, is ensnared by another group of scam artists.  Unfortunately for the brothers, things are all too supernaturally real.<br /><br />Matt Damon and Heath Ledger play the lead characters, and don't do a bad job with their material.  Monica Bellucci plays a queen, and she doesn't do so well with the material, but her character is supposed to be rather shallow, so there's little damage.<br /><br />Great special effects and sound on a reasonable budget.  CG effects must be getting pretty cheap!<br /><br />I would recommend it, but only pay the matinee prices.  It's OK for older kids.</p></body></html>

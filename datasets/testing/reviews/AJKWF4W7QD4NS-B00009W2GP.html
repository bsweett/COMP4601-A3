<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected, a satisfying end to the trilogy"></head><body><p>Despite what many fans think and what you may have heard, The Matrix Revolutions; the third and final (?) film in the Matrix trilogy sends the series off with a bang as opposed to the whimper that many expected.  First off, Revolutions is much better and more satisfying than Matrix Reloaded, and the CGI effects are better as well.  Picking up right where Reloaded left off, Neo (Keanu Reeves) finds himself trapped between the real world and the artificial world of the Matrix while the war between man and machine rages on both fronts as the people of Zion defend the city against the endless swarms of sentinels and the multiplying Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) grows more powerful in the world of the Matrix.  There aren't as many jaw dropping action scenes (until the film's climax) that populated the previous two films, but the battle for Zion and the ultra epic Super Burly Brawl in which Neo and Smith fight for the final time are marvels of modern movie magic.  As a whole however, just like Reloaded, Revolutions just can't live up to the awe of the original film.  And as much as I like the two later entries of the series, I can't help but think that there never should have been a Matrix trilogy.  When we saw Neo fly towards the sky at the end of the first film, that should have been it, but naturally Warner Bros. knows how to milk a good thing dry.  The DVD itself is much better on features than the disappointing Reloaded two disc set; with featurettes that are actually worth watching.  However, there is yet again no commentary at all.  I guess co-directors/writers Andy and Larry Wachowski are too busy counting their money.</p></body></html>

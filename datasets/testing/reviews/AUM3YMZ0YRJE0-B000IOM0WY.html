<meta name="summary" content="another formula movie with NOTHING to add"></head><body><p>This is your typical hollywood formula movie, so predictable and lacking in energy that you have to wonder if nothing better will ever emerge from that entertainment mill.  Sure, the actors are good, the special effects vivid, but this story has been told a 1000 times:  theives can rip eachother off, too, then the victims can extract revenge at great cost.<br /><br />This is a waste of time, mere TV fodder.  Not recommended, except as a way to vegitate.</p></body></html>

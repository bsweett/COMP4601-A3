<meta name="summary" content="Read the book instead"></head><body><p>Nobody writes military thrillers like Tom Clancy.  A handful of the movies made from his novels are worthy of the original manuscript. "Hunt for Red October" is my key example.<br /><br />If I had to sum up the problems for "The Sum of All Fears", I'd first mention acting.  I really like Ben Affleck, but he simply doesn't define the role like either Alec Baldwin or Harrison Ford.  Perhaps if he were cast in an earlier portion of Jack Ryan's life, he might have worked, but Affleck simply lacks the authority and competence inherent in Ford's manner--and being a MUCH younger man following Ford just seems out of sync.<br /><br />This was also one of the rare roles where I saw Morgan Freeman as Morgan Freeman.  Usually, he transports me to the place and time he's inhabiting in the character--not in this film.<br /><br />The plot is interesting--but nowhere near as well done as the book.  Just read the book.  It's available here on Amazon and well worth the price.</p></body></html>

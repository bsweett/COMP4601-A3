<meta name="summary" content="Abba dabba don't!"></head><body><p>After repeated attempts to look at this movie and literally falling asleep in the process, it dawned on me that I was looking for the thing to make sense, to have a plot, to actually be something that went from point A to point B and actually told some sort of story.<br />This was the mistake!<br />There is none of the above.<br />All it is is trans-spiritual gobble-guck rife with hordrometts and gizzle-wigkets, dolp-grommets, bing-slammits and wands that can do anything including creating flowers on graves.<br />This is the worst movie that was ever so-called created for children. It is a false spiritual odyssey.<br />The next door youngster when asked if he had seen it said: "It's goofy! I don't like that."<br />This is a massive exploitation of the American and other publics' inability to not "be with it!" There is no plot, there is no single thing to draw and keep your attention and it is so dark, dank and depressing because it is so completely absurd.<br />To enjoy and appreciate anything there must be some sort of theme or idea that catches the imagination and leads it and you through the adventure.<br />The Wizard of Ox did this brilliantly years ago, and is still treasured as a masterpiece and always will be.<br />Fifty years from now, will there be an anniversary edition of this?<br />Congratulations, to the lady who started and continued this saga.<br />She's made a fortune, and like the Piped Piper, she has "whistled" the kids of all ages straight into the sea!<br />Oh! And then we have part two...<br />Lastly, Amazon will eventually have to print this. The "pics" (people in charge) will discover the consequences if they don't.</p></body></html>

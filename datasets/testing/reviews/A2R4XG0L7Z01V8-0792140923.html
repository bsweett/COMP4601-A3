Why do people have to over-analyse things? And another thing: does Forrest really get the girl in the end? Cos if you watch right to the end, technically, he doesn't. In a way.<br /><br />My mum is a big fan of Tom Hanks, and watches Green Mile over & over, but whenever I suggest another Tom Hanks movie to her, she doesn't fancy it. I managed to sit her down in front of this, and she really enjoyed it! I love this movie, despite the length, and it has a great many stars in it: Robin Wright Penn, Sally Field, and Gary Sinise, to name but a few.<br /><br />I especially love how when Lieutenant Dan loses the bottom half of his legs, how it's done. It's fantastic! At first I thought, particularly when he was in the bed/wheelchair, that they were underneath him, or put through a hole in the bed, but apparently, his lower legs were wrapped in a special blue fabric that allowed them to be optically removed from the film by computer later.<br /><br />Lieutenant Dan tells Forrest that the day Forrest works on a shrimp boat is the day he'd be an astronaut. This is a reference to the book, where Forrest actually becomes an astronaut, and the following year, they appeared together as astronauts in Apollo 13.<br /><br />The Doors have more songs in the movie than any other band with a total of five. These are, "Soul Kitchen" (in one of the Vietnam scenes), "Hello, I Love You" (first song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), "Break On Through" (second song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), "People Are Strange" (third song in Forrest's first ping pong sequence), and "Love Her Madly" (when Jenny is leaving the hotel room with a black eye after presumably resorting to prostitution).<br /><br />I love Jenny's character in this, played by Robin Wright Penn. It's the way her whole look changes constantly throughout the movie, while Forrest stays the exact same. I think the character of Kayleigh from Butterfly Effect was loosely based around Jenny's character, as both characters change so much throughout the movie.<br /><br />There's a lot of historical events in this movie, including meeting Elvis and teaching him how to dance, he met John Lennon and gave him his inspiration for Imagine (and two presidents), he was in Vietnam and started the Watergate scandal ... he even got rich and famous. I think the Watergate scandal went straight over my head, didn't understand that bit at all. Everyone knows this stuff wasn't likely to ever happen, and I hate the fact that they used old news reels, and someone attempted (albeit badly) to change the words the people were actually speaking! The lip movements are very wrong.<br /><br />It's hard to believe this movie is now 10 years old, and fingers crossed, in another ten years, it'll be considered even more of a classic than it is now. If you liked the Back To The Future trilogy, and any other Robert Zemeckis movie, then you'll love this. The book's quite different from the movie, but that's worthwhile picking up cheap if you can.</p></body></html>

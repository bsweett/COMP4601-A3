This film is meant to capture the story of a young girl who due to unusual set of circumstances is a witness to the startling attraction between her beautiful sister and her own platonic love, housekeeper's son Robbie.  She is much younger that her sister and a young lad and confused and startled about their behavior while they are together. Her sister on the other hand, is beautiful and well aware of her high social standing.  The yound man Robbie, she is attracted to, is housekeeper's son and in spite of his obvious handsome apperance and smartness (he is a scholarship kid attending medical school at Ivies) far from a catch for a girl of her social standing.  But their mutual sexual attraction and electrofying desire will diminish all social constraints.  It is the young girl who stands in the way of their happiness and her accusation against the young man inexplicable even to herself, is a cause of their demise and her eternal sorrow for her actions.  I really enjoyed James McAwoy's performance and Vanessa Redgrave's appearance at the end of the movie is a real treat.  I do not believe that any film can ever be as powerful as Ian McEwan's written word on paper.  While Kira Knitley is beautiful to look at, her performace is just not quite there yet...</p></body></html>

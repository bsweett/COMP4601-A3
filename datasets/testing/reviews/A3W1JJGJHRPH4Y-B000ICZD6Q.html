Quaid and Grace are perfectly cast and the relationship works. Quaid lends the right comfortableness in his own skin that's right for the role.<br /><br />The movie develops its minor characters even in its funniest scenes. The movie does not waste scenes. The movie develops its story very efficiently. The movie is compact and entertaining.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the movie is a small one. I've been through downsizing. I survived multiple lay offs and been a victim of having a boss complaining about me being overpaid before he "let me go." The movie does a great job with the corporate culture, but the ending is too upbeat and too pat. It could have been better. However, the movie's ending is not totally bad, it has its moments. The movie is definitely worth renting, if not buying.</p></body></html>

The writing is excellent, the acting is superb, the cinematography is outstanding, the scope is epic with a phenomenal score that courses through the movie lending it amazing depth of emotion.  This film is flawless and filled to the brim with interesting characters and historical significance.  There are many fine acting performances here, the lead actors shining on several occasions.  Matthew Broderick has the performance in his career that finally shed that "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" stigma and established him as an A-list actor capable of carrying a dramatic role as well as sustaining comedy.  Denzel Washington is mesmerizing to watch, owning each and every scene he is in and completely earning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Cary Elwes, fresh from his enthusiastic performance in the 1987 classic "The Princess Bride," also shows some dramatic chops as surprising as Matthew Broderick brings to the table.  Then there is Morgan Freeman, who is the pride and center of the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts, and his performance sparkles accordingly.  There are so many great performances in this film that I could write for pages describing them all.  Of course, there are the incredible battle scenes, as well.  They are brilliantly staged, from long-range battle tactics to hand-to-hand combat with muskets fixed with bayonettes.  The intensity is realistic and exciting and oftentimes chilling.  At the time I saw this film in the theater back in 1989 I considered it the best Civil War film ever made.  In my mind, it has yet to be surpassed.  "Glory" is exceptional filmmaking on every level and should find a home in every DVD collection.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

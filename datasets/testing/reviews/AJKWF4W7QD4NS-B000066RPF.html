<meta name="summary" content="A perfect DVD for one of the funniest comedies ever made"></head><body><p>The whacky bunch behind Monty Python's Flying Circus got together in 1974 and crafted one of the most absurdly hilarious films ever made with Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Python vets Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin weave together a series of skits involving King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table's search of the Holy Grail; and on the way they encounter an invulnerable Black Knight (&quot;I'll bite your legs off!&quot;), a killer white rabbit, three headed knights who say &quot;Ni!&quot;, and a castle full of swooning, virginal seductive maidens.  Whether you are a fan of the series or not, you will find this film one of the funniest movies you'll ever see, and it is an essential comedy to anyone and everyone.  The DVD features are more than worth noting as well; the double disc DVD features a laugh out loud commentary by Gilliam and Jones along with Cleese, Idle, and Palin, three karaoke-esque sing alongs, Gilliam's original artwork, fantasticly designed interactive menus based on Gilliam's art, and tons more.  If you own this on video or own the older edition DVD, then you should immediately pick this Special Edition up right away.</p></body></html>

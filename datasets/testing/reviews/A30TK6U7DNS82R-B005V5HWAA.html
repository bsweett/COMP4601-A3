Well the laugh was on me, for after about ten minutes you know you're watching something really special.  I've always liked Costner, but even his mother might tell him that in recent years it seems he's lost his way, but without all that baggage, say if he was a new actor, the critics might have noticed that this performance here is worthy of an Oscar, as the businessman tamped down tight as a drum.  He runs a box factory which is perfect for his part, for he is like Pandora's box, pretty on the outside but with all the evils in the world just waiting to be tapped and let loose on an unsuspecting world.<br /><br />His opposite number, Demi Moore, is awesome also.  Again, another stunning actress who doesn't get the praise people award say, Dame Helen Mirren and why?  Bad choices in the past methinks!  If you have the DVD be sure to watch the deleted scenes feature--practically all of them feature Demi's character, Tracy Atwood, and at least one of them has a splendid and unexpected twist in Atwood's character--all I can say is, for an actress to have so many meaty bits left on the cutting floor is a real slap in the face, and the wonder is, the movie didn't even need those missing parts and neither did Demi's performance, though if she's annoyed I can't blame her!<br /><br />Though they make a big deal out of the fact that Costner is Portland's man of the year, the landscape looks very un-Portland.  I was expecting to see a motice at the end of the movie that the location scenes were filmed in Vancouver or Toronto...  the way most pictures for the past 20 years have been--to save money I guess.  Perhaps the falling dollar has made Canada not so attractive to film companies nowadays?  I was thunderstruck to see that the footage in question was filmed in Shreveport Louisiana!  No wonder it looks nothing like Portland!  You'd think they could just tweak the script a little and instruct the actors to play it Southern style.  As it is, the disjunction between what the script is saying and what the camera is telling us leaves audiences off balance, a foot on two stools as it were</p></body></html>

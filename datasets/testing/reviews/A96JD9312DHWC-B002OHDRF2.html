<meta name="summary" content="If you can hear this YOU are the Resistance"></head><body><p>Skynet becomes aware in 2003 and all hell breaks loose. Machines make the Earth their stomping ground for the next 18 years, while humans find themselves hunted and terminated by specially built machines. All the while, John Connor fights alongside of the Resistance, making certain that the "prophecy" about his future comes true. Skynet also knows about this prediction and begins taking measure to stop this by hunting him and Kyle Reese to keep Judgment Day's purty end machine-based, building all sorts of interesting things into this now 15-year-old storyline. Then there's Marcus, the sub, the signal, and a few dozen other things that are best left to the movie to describe.<br /><br />Out of all of the Terminator movies, i have to say that i liked this one the best. Instead of having one machine going after one person, we finally have the future that we had been promised. Sure, this isn't far enough for Connor to get his wings and take out the net, but it does show just how far he''s come. Scenes like those with him meeting high command also show how much skepticism is going around about him and his supposed future, but that doesn't seem to bother him. The thing he worries about is Kyle and meetting him, not to mention the fact that Skynet has the two of them on a kill list. and then there's Marcus - something that he doesn't have the slightest notion how to deal with.<br /><br />One of the things i liked about the movie were the different types of machines that Skynet had built. It has collection machines, Hunter/Killers patrolling the sky, machines to kill all foot traffic, things on the road, and T-600s everywhere. We are just now up to the T-800 launch as well, and we are just now up to Skynet beginning its "dark times." so, humanity still has a fighting chance when battling and it isn't like the first movie. The fields of skulls may exist somewhere but, along with those, the humans have A-10 Warthogs and other weapons. This makes for some good fights, some interesting moral dilemmas, and some themes I wasn't expecting. It seemed like a thinking person's skynet, which I thought was interesting in the making.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series I figure you will go here anyhow. People who do not like it may want to check it out anyhow because this movie is different. It breaks a lot of cyclical bonds while still keeping the story, making it interesting. Personally, I liked it above all the others, and I even remember the first through a child's eyes - and it was something else. Recommended and then some.</p></body></html>

And 1994's Pulp Fiction epitomizes a flick that leaves a permanent impression.<br /><br />If you said to me that you've never seen Pulp Fiction I'd be very surprised (unless you're a teenager or younger). This movie is so classic, from it's stellar out of order storyline(s) to the memorable quotes throughout the film.<br /><br />Pulp Fiction houses Samuel L. Jackson's best performance in a film ever, and most of the memorable quotes involve his perfectly portrayed character Jules in some way, shape or form. Jackson should have gotten the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his only Oscar nomination. But it went to Martin Landau that year for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood. I remember like yesterday as they announced the winner of the award they showed all the Best Supporting Actor nominees in their own little windows, and when they read Landau's name you could see Jackson mouth the words in true Jules fashion, "Oh, that's b***s***!". I agree, Sam...I agree.<br /><br />This is the movie that also revived John Travolta's slumping career. Maybe revived isn't the right word...perhaps saying this movie put Travolta in a much needed refreshing light would be better said. Pulp Fiction took Travolta from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S86J2Q">Grease</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXH5">Staying Alive</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NJMJHA">Barbarino</a> character into a tough, take-me-seriously character. Travolta got the Best Actor nomination for his role as Vincent in Pulp Fiction, but he didn't win (the winner was Tom Hanks for his Forrest Gump role which was a lot more understandable than Jackson's snub).<br /><br />Pulp Fiction has some of the best screenwriting in any drama that I've ever seen; and at least the Academy agreed with me on that as the Best Screenplay nod did go to Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino. Every lead actor in this film really shines; Tarantino really got the best out of his all-star, A-List cast.<br /><br />Pulp Fiction on Blu Ray is a long awaited addition to my collection. The movie looked great with its 1080p transfer and the DTS sound (with such a great musical score) was terrific. I haven't watched the Extras on this new Blu Ray release yet, but at some point I will find the time for all 6+ hours of them from interviews with the cast, to behind the scenes footage to deleted scenes and more.<br /><br />Step aside, Butch. Pick up this movie....This is a tasty burger!</p></body></html>

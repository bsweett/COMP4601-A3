"Flags of Our Fathers" attains though its pleasures are many.<br />This film stars the great Japanese star, Ken Watanabe as General Kuribayashi sent by the powers-that-be to Iwo Jima to take charge of a mission that is doomed in that, at this point in the war, the Japanese fleet has been destroyed and no help is available to Kuribayashi and his meager, barely trained troops. General Kuribayashi is in Iwo Jima then to serve Japan and to die with honor. Watanabe's Kuribayashi goes about his desperate project with the zeal and fervor of a man, though he is well aware of the inevitable outcome, who cares nothing about saving his own hide but only that of his soldiers: he is caring, loving, intelligent and exceedingly world weary. This is a nuanced and emotionally available performance by Watanabe.<br />"LFIJ" is filmed in Japanese and told from the Japanese point of view and frankly it feels a little strange rooting for this rag-tag group of officers and soldiers particularly since the USA is the "enemy."  Eastwood's point of view then is finely tuned with a deep sense of respect for the Japanese yet I can't help feeling that Eastwood is stacking the deck here by not mentioning and/or ignoring the many atrocities that the Japanese perpetrated on China and others during this same period.<br />Filmed in sepia tones with splashes of color, "Letters from Iwo Jima" is beautifully filmed by Tom Stern and ultimately it is a deeply affecting and thoughtful depiction of men at war: some filled with duty and honored to be there and others merely fulfilling their conscriptions.</p></body></html>

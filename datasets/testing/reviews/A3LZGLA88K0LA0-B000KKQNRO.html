Akiva Goldman's script follows the book very closely with some changes including a different ending, and Ron Howard has assembled a talented cast.  The problem for me:  it was really rather dull, too cerebral to be considered an action or suspense movie, and Tom Hanks just didn't seem to inhabit his role as much as in previous films.<br /><br />Unless you've been on Mars for the past few years, you should know that the movie's central premise is that the Catholic Church is hiding a secret that if discovered would change the face of Christianity as we know it.  Whether you adhere to the suppositions posited by the movie or not, which I don't, you may be disappointed in the film's somewhat lethargic pacing and some improbable plot devices.  Audrey Tautou is okay as the heroine, but it's really Ian McKellen as the fanatical Priorist who steals the movie, but he's not in it enough to raise its level of excellence.  Jean Reno's detective is well done, but Alfred Molina is wasted in an unexplained role, while Paul Bettany's Silas is deranged but not fully recognized.<br /><br />All in all, THE DA VINCI CODE is an okay movie, but I was expecting something a little more.</p></body></html>

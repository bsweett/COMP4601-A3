<meta name="summary" content="A bold departure for P.D. James (author) results in a stunning film"></head><body><p>While I loved the movie, I strongly suggest you read the book as well. There are differences between the two and, of course, verbal descriptions of characters' thoughts are often hard to reproduce on screen. Almost always, sacrifices must be made in the script - and this film is no exception. However, I DO feel the movie stays true to the INTENT and MESSAGE of the book and it is quite a wonderful film.<br /><br />  It is futuristic and if you know anything about the author of the book on which this film is based (P.D. James) you'll know this isn't her usual mystery story. But it is one of my favorite works that she has written, telling of a time when people are infertile and of the hope that resides when there is a chance that someone can produce children again.<br /><br />  The government gets involved and there are political messages and subplots, all set against a certain, dark atmosphere. This film will make you think and I actually find the possibility of a future where infertility is almost the norm not outside the realm of possibility. Even if you don't, the "What ifs?" will keep you interested in this masterful film and Clive Owen proves that he is  becoming more interesting an actor as time goes on.</p></body></html>

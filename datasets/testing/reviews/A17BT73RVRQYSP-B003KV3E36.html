Sylvester Stallone's return as John Rambo is not only a good movie but a movie that has become a rallying cry to a group of actually fighting tyrany.<br /><br />We find our hero settled in Thailand, working with and catching snakes.  He is approached by a group from a church wanting to bring in a group of doctors into Burma.  Rambo declines warning them of the danger but the persistence of Sarah (Julie Benz) of religious convinces them to go.  A dangerous run-in fails to deter them and Rambo leaves them in a village where they start tending to the people's needs.<br /><br />To nobody's surprise a short time later the leader of the parish approaches him.  They haven't gotten out and haven't been heard from so he hires Rambo to bring in a group a mercs to the spot where he dropped them.<br /><br />The use of these characters really makes a difference in the movie, Rambo doesn't have to carry all the load (he is the "boat guy") and the interplay between the various guys really works well.  There is not a bad performance in the lot.<br /><br />The special features concerning the making of the movie really adds value, particularly the story of the actual repression in Burma.  The chief villain of the picture is an actual refugee from the war which is as bad as the picture describes it.  The only objection I have to the entire disk are the deleted scenes.  I think they all should have been included they would have really added to the story.<br /><br />The Military Junta is so upset over this picture that the sale of this movie is punishable by death and the possession can get you 10 years.  The rebels have taken the picture's catch phrase as their own.<br /><br />It's very rare that a picture has this kind of impact in the real world.  even if the movie wasn't as good as it was, it should be celebrated for that.<br /><br />This picture is worth your money and when the history of the fallen dictatorship is written, this picture will be a part of it.</p></body></html>

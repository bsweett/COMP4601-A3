<meta name="summary" content="fun action flick anaglyth version"></head><body><p>This was briefly put out with the anaglyth red and green glasses type of 3d. That system was the only type available when this was put out on blu ray. Today you can get a proper 3d version that is actually cheapet to buy than this one is.  I would make sure to ask which version you are getting. The newer 3d version needs a 3d tv and 3d player and it looks outstanding. The older version which uses the old style glasses is ok but it can't compare. In fact using the red and green glasses causes a ghosting effect, (images seems to have lines around them or a fainter second image) this is ccmmon and normal when using those old style glasses. SO you don't want to pay 35.00 for that version, while the version with the 3d logo on it looks great as you will have the black glasses and a three d tv.  The story isn't as good as the 1959 version which is coming out on blu ray in 2012, but it's fun and a romp with effects from the 00's decade so that's a bonus.  It's got extras too. But I would certainly not waste your money on a older 3d version with green and red glasses unless you don't ever intend buying a 3d tv. That would be a mistake though as the format is outstanding. SO make sure to ask which version you are getting. The older is more exp3ensive because it was in print only a few months and lots of people complained abou tit and it was yanked out of print.  The ghosting though is what you get with those glasses on a tv. that's just the way it was until the new format came out and you can get this in the new format for less!.</p></body></html>

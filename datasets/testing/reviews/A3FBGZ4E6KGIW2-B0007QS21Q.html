It held my interest for only a few seconds (which I think it's obvious which scene that was, I wasn't expecting that) There are special effects, but those could be created with a computer for any movie at any time.  I like Will Smith, but this just doesn't do it for me.  If sci-fi is what you crave, I would say look elsewhere.  I've seen the comparisons to Blade Runner, which don't hold up to me because at least I can say I enjoyed that movie.</p></body></html>

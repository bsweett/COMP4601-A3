It is responsible, almost single-handedly (along with SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE) for ushering in the current era of "indie films."  Right around the same time that every home in America seemed to have a VCR, these "little" movies came out, tacking daring subjects in a daring manner. And while they got little attention in traditional movie-houses, everyone heard the buzz on them and rented them and turned them into cult classics.<p>I watched the movie again the other day. It shows clearly the Tarentino hallmarks that would make him huge with PULP FICTION, KILL BILL, etc.  Snappy, clever, filthy dialogue.  Elaborate violence...unrealistic amounts of blood pouring from one person's body.  Cool camera moves and great use of music.  (After all, can anyone really hear STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU in quite the same way again?).<p>But the film is showing its rough edges.  What seemed edgy and new now sometimes looks a little lazy.  Long shots through doorways, where the camera sits still and the actors move in and out of the shot.  Kinda cool, but...kinda boring.  Cool male actors encouraged to yell and overact.  Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi are all great actors, and they're  pretty darn memorable in this film.  BUT, they are also occasionally prone to rage and scream above what seems believable.  Many of the "tricks" of this film have been used so often since, that unfortunately, they feel trite now.  It's not fair to blame this film for what came later.  Therefore, I still say it's a classic, BUT, not always a classic that thrills with repeated viewings.  PULP FICTION, all these years later, still tickles me and excites me.  But there were long stretches of RESERVOIR DOGS where I felt like dozing.<p>However, if you HAVEN'T seen it, I still recommend that you do!</p></body></html>

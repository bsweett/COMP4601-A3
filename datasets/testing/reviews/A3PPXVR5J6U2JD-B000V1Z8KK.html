<meta name="summary" content="1% of Californian students expect to be snipers in 10 years -- here's why"></head><body><p>In "Microtrends," a new book by pollster Mark Penn, 1 percent of Californians between the ages of 16 and 22 expected to be military snipers in 10 years. Why? "Aspiring snipers are evidence of a patriotic generation, who see sniping--a profession requiring reserve and cool in a war without front lines--as the new "Top Gun" military profession." Mix this particular factoid with the "other gunman" conspiracy theory and you have Shooter.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays Bob Lee Swagger, a military sniper abandoned during a field op.  His best friend dies in the ensuing fracas, but Swagger survives to become one of those militia-type recluses who lives alone with his dog in the mountains, spouting conspiracy theory.  He's just the kind of antihero America needs, and it's not long before Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) asks for his help in serving the country once more.  It seems an assassination attempt is planned against the President, and only Swagger can plot out the sniper's moves before he actually makes them.  Playing on Swagger's patriotic sympathies, Johnson lures him out into the open and...<br /><br />Spoiler alert!  But seriously, you saw this coming, right?<br /><br />Surprise, surprise, in retracing the steps of a would-be assassin, Swagger is framed AS the assassin! An all-out manhunt ensues, with Swagger enlisting allies like the girlfriend of his dead buddy (tasty Kate Mara as Sarah Fenn) and an agent in the wrong place at the wrong time (Michael Pena as Nick Memphis).  Seems the good Colonel is actually a subversive government agent working for a Dick Cheney-esque senator, Charles F. Meachum (Ned Beatty).<br /><br />Thus ensues a cat-and-also-cat game between Swagger and everyone else as they struggle to track down a ghost who strikes like a thunderbolt out of the blue.  The twists and turns, the blatant pandering to conspiracy theory, and the demonizing of a Republican-run government are all very entertaining or insulting, depending on your views.  And Shooter delivers in spades, with plenty of head shots that make this movie the modern descendant of Rambo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Shooter is also highly predictable.  Swagger's inevitable betrayal is obvious from the start.  And the fact that the government agents might not be good guys is clearly telegraphed by Elias Koteas, who dresses like a bad guy in his black suit and tie, and even adjusts it once, goodfella style. I mean, the guy's  name is Jack Payne for crying out loud!  Why not just call him Major Blood and be done with it?<br /><br />Still, Shooter is very entertaining.  There's enough skin, violence, humor and conspiracy theory to keep an audience entertained. The ending may be complete wish fulfillment, but it's extremely satisfying. Those Californians will have plenty of reasons to want to be snipers by the end of this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brutal and Breathtaking Metro Retro Noir"></head><body><p>I rented this film and was not expecting such a thrill ride.  2005 came out with an exciting adaptation of Frank Miller's exciting graphic novel, Sin City, based on three of Miller's immensely popular and immensely gritty books (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard).<br /><br />I was first struck by the photography: the black & white noir, harkens back to Dashell Hammet's gritty crime scenes, a Mickey Spillane (crime novel writer to you kids) special.  The color'd items popped into view: green eyes, red lips and occasionally white blood -- decapitations and body limbs flying not withstanding.<br /><br />Jessica Alba is hot in this picture, just seeing her in the cowboy outfit rates a couple of stars right there.  Bruce Willis, the tough, arrogant cop framed for a rape/murder he did not commit, a linking of tale and trouble, seemless in its execution.<br /><br />I liked the guy who was in love with Goldie, who was murdered in his bed as she slept; the mysterious fella with the Harry Potter look who ate the souls (and flesh) of whores -- shivering in me timbers, I was.<br /><br />[SPOILER} Some parts were hard to follow:  Who was the guy in the beginning who murdered the woman on the balcony and who later appeared at the end of the film to confront our traitoress in the elevator?  [END SPOILER)<br /><br />Frank Miller took "funny books" and made them exciting entertainment; later adaptation of 300 was his next big one.  Funny, I like S.C. better.<br /><br />Read the novel and then watch this film.  Also check out the DVD extra on Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino's take on the film.<br /><br />Suggest:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593963149">Frank Miller's Complete Sin City Library</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RHGRT8">The Spirit</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QXDED6">300 (Widescreen Edition)</a></p></body></html>

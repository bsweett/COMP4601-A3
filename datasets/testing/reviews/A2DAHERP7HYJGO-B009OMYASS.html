<meta name="summary" content="CONTROVERSY FOR THE SAKE OF CONTROVERSY"></head><body><p>There are controversial movies that live up to the promise of being something unique, something different, something that captivates an audience that while revolting them or surprising them it still becomes a movie that you can recommend to others. This is not one of them.<br /><br />The film tells the story of two American friends, Paxton and Josh, who are backpacking their way across Europe. Picking up a Scandinavian friend, they move from hostel to hostel (popular youth hotels that are fairly inexpensive) seeing the sights and doing everything in their power to bed as many European beauties as possible.<br /><br />While out on the town one night seeking women, a local tells them of a hostel in a nearby country that caters to American's seeking action. He leads them to believe that once their accents are known, women will be basically tossing themselves at the two. Off they go in search of naked European women.<br /><br />Arriving at the hostel they discover they must share a room. It turns out their roommates are two voluptuous women who begin the day by changing while the boys enter the room. Hitting the town, the next morning they find their Scandinavian friend gone, leaving with no message. The next night, both are on the town with the two girls (who each has bedded) when they begin to get dizzy. While Paxton passes out locked up in the local bar's stock room, Josh wakes to find himself chained to a chair in the dingiest of basement cells.<br /><br />Thus the promise tales of HOSTEL begins to unfold, where we find that it has all been a set up luring young men and women to this country where lawlessness runs rampant. So much so that for the right price, you can actually kill and torture someone. Which is what happens to Josh. Slices, dices, ankles cut to prevent running away, gouges and more are in store for anyone who is taken to this den of depravity.<br /><br />So much for Josh. Paxton wakes to find his friend now missing. Searching high and low, he too is captured only to escape. But in true heroic fashion, he must attempt to save his friend as well as the young Japanese girl the two met in the hostel.<br /><br />This movie yearns to churn the strongest of stomachs. The effects are realistic but not to the point of causing any realist to think they actually performed these gory acts. While these scenes are not numerous enough to satiate the most deeply disturbed gore hounds, they are enough to cause a bit of nausea in the normal filmgoer.<br /><br />What is truly disturbing about this film is less what is seen on the screen as considering those sitting and watching it. While the film attempts to show how depraved a society we have become where we can find amusement and entertainment in the death and destruction of a human being, it in itself does just that, attempting to entertain us with scenes of torture and bloodshed.<br /><br />Interviews with director Eli Roth (CABIN FEVER) have stated that he found the idea from a web site he heard about on the internet. And he wanted to make people feel disgusted with what they saw, make them realize how terrible people could be, how low they cold sink. He does this in spades. But at the same time, he caters not only to the morbidly curious but the blood loving sadists as well. In showing us the worst he can dream up with people interested in killing someone for entertainment, he does the same by making each viewer a part of the same group.<br /><br />Subsequent interviews with Roth have heard him talk about how the fault of both HOSTEL films lies not with the director or manufacturer of the film but in audiences who just don't get it. This is always a good argument when someone's movies aren't well received (the 2nd fell flat at the box office). Have I missed the boat when Hollywood hails films like this as artistic? Give me entertainment over artistic any day.<br /><br />This film may be interesting to some, and certainly if you are one who feels the need to see controversial films to discover what the hubbub is all about (unfortunately I include myself in this group), you will be satisfied. But for most it will be a reviling experience that leaves you feeling the need for a good hot shower.</p></body></html>

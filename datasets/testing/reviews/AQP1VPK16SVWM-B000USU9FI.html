<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly agile remake"></head><body><p>You're not paranoid if they are out to get you.  Remakes are programmed to succeed. Give the audience something familiar and their more likely to go to it. It's like comfort food for the eyes.  Remakes are a tricky business. Change the plot too much and you risk alienating fans of the original film. Don't change the plot enough and fans of the original will be bored. Meanwhile, those that DIDN"T see the original will wonder what all the fuss is about. Usually the result is a film that gets lost and that no one sees. Jonathan Demme's failed remake of "Charade" was a case in point of everything that can go wrong with a remake. Luckily, "The Manchurian Candidate" succeeds where that remake failed by touching on the themes of the original film, updating the story for a post-9/11 world and through careful casting. Although it's flawed, it's still a powerful film that will leave an impression with audiences. Hitchcock liked to point out that suspense thrillers aren't really designed to connect with common sense or answer all the questions we expect. That would be true of "Silence Of The Lambs" and also the remake of "The Manchurian Candidate" as well. Demme realizes, like Hitchcock, that suspense thrillers don't necessarily have to have the orderly clock work precise logic of a mystery. They have different purposes. The former is a mind puzzle the latter is just designed to keep you glued to your seat.<br /><br />In the midst of the Gulf War a platoon of soldiers fight off an enemy advance with their Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) fighting off the enemy single handedly while his commanding officer Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is incapacitated . Or did he? It seems that members of Marco's platoon are having nightmares about what happened and these nightmares, which seem vividly real, suggest that something else entirely happened and that, in fact, Shaw killed one of their own and that this is some sort of weird plot to deceive the American public. Since Marco and others members of his troop appear to be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome and symptoms of paranoia, their observations are discounted until Marco discovers some troubling information<br /><br />A number of interesting extras include the usual "making of" featurette. The best featurette is the one on the cast of the film. We get to hear the cast discuss their characters, their reasons for interest in a remake of a paranoid thriller/political satire. There's also deleted scenes (which help to clarify a couple of plot points but aren't essential) as well as the screen test that actor Liev Schreiber did with Meryl Streep for Demme prior to production. Schreiber clearly was the perfect candidate for the movie with his boyish good looks and undercurrent of vulnerability. There's also an option to watch the uncut faux news program hosted by Al Franken with optional commentary as well.<br /><br /> Director Demme and co-screenwriter Pyne discuss not only the nuts and bolts of working on the movie but what their intensions (even if they don't always work and they'll admit it themselves first) were. Both clearly enjoy each other's company and compliment each other very well covering material that the other hadn't thought about.<br /><br />An exceptionally good remake that updates this classic paranoid satire for contemporary audiences, "The Manchurian Candidate" brings Richard Condon's novel and John Frankenheimer's classic 1964 film to life with nice unique touches all its own. While Demme's decision to make the political satire more subtle is questionable (based on a lot of reviews here some folks missed that angle), Demme's sure hand and the script by Pyne and Gregarious provide the perfect canvas for the cast to express themselves. The outstanding cast manages to make their characters uniquely their own. If you're unsure of the film, I'd suggest renting it first and seeing if appeals to you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So-so Michael Moore documentary on the American Health System"></head><body><p>The USA stands alone in the Western world with the lack of a free public health system. "Sicko" - another film in the Michael Moore production line - explores this issue. The film is reasonably entertaining but for a non-American audience not particularly revelatory.<br /><br />Reform of the American health system is incredibly difficult because of the influence of health lobbyists on legislators - and like gun control there is a lot of hand-wringing but little change.<br /><br />Sadly Moore does not make any effort to hear the "other" side of the story, which could have made this documentary much more interesting.</p></body></html>

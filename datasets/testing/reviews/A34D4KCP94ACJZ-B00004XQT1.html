It's only significant difference is that it leaves out some of the more gruesome scenarios in Ellis's book.  I'm not sure whether that's a drawback or not but there was some rage missing in our killer's actions.  The film operates as a first person narrative and contains the same kind of oddball combinations of extreme violence and dark humor.  This kind of humor is exactly my kind of humor, so I laughed at American Psycho throughout.  Mary Harron also seemed to recognize that the novel was old enough that she should approach the film as a period piece and she executes this well.  Everything about this movie feels like the late 1980s.  She creates a virtual remake of the novel as I pictured it in my head years ago.  From what I understand Harron also fought hard to keep the role of Patrick Bateman (the title character and the story's protagonist) in the capable hands of Christian Bale.  Bale is outstanding here and Harron really seems to be a directorial force with her actors.<br /><br />Patrick Bateman is a 27 year-old wealthy and successful investor.  He is clearly a product of a privileged and ultra-competitive background.  We follow him around and listen to all of his observations of the world he lives in.  This is of course the yuppie culture of the 1980s. Perhaps Bateman is the extreme yuppie and a harbinger to the ills of this socially produced subgroup and the culture they exist in.  As it turns out his world features the substantiality that he is indeed a murderer.  Unfortunately no one seems to notice this, despite his blatant and at times hilariously dry claims that he is a psycho.  Evidence of his murders also seemed to disappear quite easily.  American Psycho, like the novel, is a great satire that might leave viewers with some frustrating questions in the end.  What was real and what was imaginary?<br /><br />The rest of the cast includes Wilem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chlo? Sevigny, and Reese Witherspoon.  All are fairly effective within their roles but the film weighed heavily on Bale's performance.  He understands Patrick Bateman and makes the character the mind-blowingly shallow and overly competitive monster he is.<br /><br />The thing that surprises most is that a great female director like Harron decided to take on a story so pervasively accused of misogyny.  Harron's other films are about a radical feminist (Valerie Salanas in I Shot Andy Warhol) and an icon of women's liberation (Bettie Page in The Notorious Bettie Page).  I almost think she intentionally went against the grain here to break out of the mold Hollywood can often create for women and minority directors.  Good for her.  Her movies are interesting and American Psycho is a stand-out.</p></body></html>

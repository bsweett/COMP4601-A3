<meta name="summary" content="Memo To Hollywood: Stop Treating Tribal People Like Inept Morons!"></head><body><p>We are now in the 21st Century! Isn't it about time Hollywood puts racist, 19th Century "savage" stereotypes into the dustbin of history? Why are we still exposed to this kind of crap? It's sickening to pick `on the most vulnerable people in the world. From the Amazon tribes deep inside the rain forest, to the Mbuti (formerly called "Pygmies") who reside in the vast Ituri located in the Congo, to the aboriginal inhabitants of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands - tribal people are quite real, and they have rich cultures with incredible wisdom & survival skills.<br /><br />They also own, collectively, very valuable land and other natural resources! Something huge transnational corporations and various occupying governments covet to this very day! Even more unbelievable,  in this modern day and age, "Survival International estimates  there are around 100 UNCONTACTED tribes in the world,  of which more than half are in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon."  Uncontacted means these tribal people have NEVER been face-to-face with a so-called "civilized" Western Man or Women, like you, or me!<br /><br />In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the tribal people are obviously guarding their own territory (nation). It's obvious to all concerned, a sacred location! - And it's so ironic! I can only imagine how the Civilized American Man would be portrayed if he was attempting to protect New York's Saint Patrick's Cathedral, or the Lincoln Memorial from the intrusion of grave robbers (thieves), like Indiana Jones, or a heavily armed foreign mercenary force out to do no good. He would be portrayed as heroic! But when a tribal person (Red, Yellow, or Black) tries to do the same exact thing, he's an inept, scary buffoon!<br /><br />Unfortunately,  these perverted Hollywood stereotypes are the only contact many people have with tribal people. To help change that perception,  I highly recommend two international, non-profit organizations: Cultural Survival in the United States & Survival International in the United Kingdom (England). It's about time the American public no longer tolerates this disgusting form of racism!<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007J71S">Cultural Survival Quar...</a>,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303402461">Ishi - The Last Yahi</a>,</p></body></html>

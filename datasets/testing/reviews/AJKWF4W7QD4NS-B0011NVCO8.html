<meta name="summary" content="Though it really offers nothing new, this is still a worthwhile crime epic"></head><body><p>Though it languished in development-hell for some time, American Gangster has finally seen the light of day, with none other than visionary director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Alien, Blade Runner) at the helm.  Oscar winning mega-stars Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are the prime drawing point of the film, and both actors chew every bit of scenery that they can during the film's duration.  Washington is Frank Lucas, the newly christened drug kingpin of Harlem after taking the reigns from legendary gangster Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III), and soon finds himself hounded by crooked cops, rival dealers, and honest cop Richie Roberts (Crowe).  Though it really doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before in the gangster epic genre, American Gangster is still a rousing and worthwhile crime epic that is carried by the power of its stars and director.  The action and set pieces are well done, but the film as a whole doesn't come close to the greatness that it aspires to emulate from other classics in the genre like Serpico and The Untouchables.  Flaws aside though, American Gangster is still a more than admirable true crime drama, which can be evidenced even more so on the unrated extended cut, which is included here along with the theatrical release.  The extended cut features much more character development, which isn't a bad thing at all when the cast includes Chiwetel Eliofor, Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding Jr, Ted Levine, Armand Assante, Deadwood's John Hawkes, rappers RZA and Common, and Ruby Dee in a brief Oscar nominated turn as Lucas' mother.  All in all, American Gangster is a very satisfying crime drama, and though it really isn't anything we haven't seen before, it's still definitely worth a look.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing Remake of Retro Dance Movie"></head><body><p>Hollywood should have left the original version alone, the remake is just awful and loses the spirit of the play.  It is full of energy and starts out fresh, but soon gets bogged down with a overdoing a heavy message on racism, which the first movie kept in perspective for a light and fluffy teen musical.<br /><br />It was fun to look back through rose-colored glasses at 1962 and overall simplistic view of the times.  The first movie was better - even though this version of "Hairspray"  was fun seeing John Travolta in drag.</p></body></html>

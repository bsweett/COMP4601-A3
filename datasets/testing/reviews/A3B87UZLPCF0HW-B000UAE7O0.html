A throwback to the B-movie nastiness of the 1970s, the flick centres of a group of survivors, including a mysterious drifter, El Wray (Rodriguez), a solicitous stripper (McGowan) and a doctor desperate to escape her possessive husband (Shelton) - all of whom are immune to a toxic gas that is making the majority of the town hungry for blood and guts. They must fight off the zombies using seemingly every weapon imaginable, to endure the night and get safely to Mexico. Easily the strongest part of the proposed double-feature, Planet Terror is a horror film very much in the vein of earlier Rodriguez cult classic From Dusk Till Dawn - inexplicably entertaining and cheesy at the same time. However, some of the dialogue feels tongue-in-cheek, while other scenes are played arrow-straight and suffer as a consequence. Rodriguez is widely-regarded as one of the most innovative directors working today, and if Planet Terror does nothing else, it proves that point unequivocally.</p></body></html>

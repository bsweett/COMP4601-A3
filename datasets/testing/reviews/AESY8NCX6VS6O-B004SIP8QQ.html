<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino still has the ability to knock your socks off!"></head><body><p>Pretty early on, it's quite clear you're watching something great, but about 3/4ths into the infinitely better second leg of Kill Bill, there's a moment that will have your jaw hitting the floor. David Carradine's rugged Bill pulls out a huge butcher knife in front of The Bride and their daughter, wields it with all of his haunting intensity, brings it down with lethal precision...<p>  ...and makes a sandwich.<p> That's right. Quentin Tarantino, the hyper mastermind behind Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, has the honor of creating the best sandwich-making scene in the history of film. Bill plunges the knife into the mayonnaise, lays the meat down piece by piece, and delivers an important monologue in a comically domestic setting that will have you drooling. And I'm not joking. But that's what sets Kill Bill Volume 2 apart from most movies being made today, and nearly everything else in Tarantino's oeuvre. Tarantino knows the importance of, to quote Vincent Vega, "the little things," and the little things include his intricate, often-funny dialogue (somewhat missing from the first installment) that shines nearly as bright as Pulp Fiction. It's back with a vengeance here.<br /><br /> Even though the movie isn't as violent and has more of Tarantino's legendary chit-chat, it still hops through genre hoops like his best work. The beginning of the film, guided by Uma Thurman's sassy narration, goes back to the infamous wedding chapel where the massacre that started it all occurred. What is so interesting about the scene, though, is how normal everything seems...yet there's a seething undercurrent of tension and suspense to it all. You can feel it during the light banter at The Bride's (I won't reveal her actual name - you have to see the movie for that) rehearsal, a tense conversation between her and Bill, and then in the moments after. <p> At first, the movie evokes a Western (Quentin even nods his head to John Ford with a Searchers-inspired shot through the frame of a door). Then the movie switches gears and conjures up that deadly femme-fatale suspense thriller vibe as The Bride gets closer to Bud (Michael Madsen). Then...wait. A flashback, and it's a campy '70' ninja homage as we see The Bride's tutelage under the fierce Pai Mei. This exciting movie never knows when to sit still, and that's what's so great about it. Tarantino, as usual, is punch-drunk with his love for the movies and as often as Bill can wow with dialogue, it's still difficult to top a great catfight.<br /><br /> At 44, Daryl Hannah is sexier than ever (yes, even Splash) as Elle Driver, and seeing her in an ultra-violent knock-down-drag-out catfight with the equally sexy Uma Thurman has to be the ultimate Tarantino geek fantasy fulfilled (count me in!). I won't divulge specifics of their brawl (which reportedly took 3 weeks to shoot), but it's one of many applause-worthy moments of the movie. Driver could be the most vicious and scary villains of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and damn is she cool. Much like Travolta in Pulp Fiction, her stint in Bill should be enough to rescucitate a career that hasn't been going so well lately. I can just see that freak, Tarantino, sitting in his home watching the stupid remake of Rear Window, Hannah's forgettable roles in Grumpy Old Men and Wall Street, and saying, "There is one dead-sexy, scary chick underneath all that." The Bride and Driver have one of the most electrifying scenes in the movie, and unlike tripe like the Matrix sequels, Tarantino and editor Sally Menke know when to cut, move on, and - best of all - create a final standoff between the two ladies that will have you peeing your pants.<p> And all of that is great stuff. But, remarkably, what makes Kill Bill Volume 2 better than its limb-chopping predecessor is the movie's final act, where everything comes together and Tarantino's true theme of the movie - motherhood - comes to full fruition. The movie, at the most perfect points, has the ability to surprise you, and the biggest surprise of them all is that Bill has its most suspenseful, powerful, and shockingly brilliant moments in the rather quiet final section. <p> I've seen Tarantino outdo himself before (the climax of Jackie Brown, Michael Madsen's vicious dismember-fest in Reservoir Dogs), but what he does with this seemingly simple tale of revenge simply goes beyond explanation. I can explain part of it: David Carradine. The dude just exudes 'cool' with every scratchy syllable, every squinty look, and every confident step. I heard that Tarantino originally wanted Warren Beatty, and I am sure-as-hell glad that fell through, for a Supporting Actor Oscar should be in the works now. And let me not forget Uma. She seemed more a killin' machine in 1, but she's best as a conflicted mother in 2, and some of the best work of her career rests in the film's climactic scene that will shock you not because it's violent (it's not), but because it's perfect. Tarantino's dialogue drives the point of the movie home with expert precision, and you might even feel a little choked up. Choked up? In the crying sense? In a Tarantino movie? I told you he'd surprise you.</p></body></html>

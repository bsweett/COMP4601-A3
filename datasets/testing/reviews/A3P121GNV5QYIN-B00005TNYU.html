<meta name="summary" content="The Goonies R Still Good Enough!!"></head><body><p>I was 4 years old when I saw this,I'm 21 now and could never tire of it.It was and still is one of the best movies of my childhood.And I still want that Purple Rain shirt(lol).We follow the adventures of Mikey,Brand,Mouth,Data,Stef,Andy and who could forget Chunk.NO ONE!!! It's one of Richard Donner's best films I think his first best will be and forever will be Superman.When I heard that this awesome classic was going to DVD,I ran out of the house to buy it,even though I did have it on video,DVD is way better.I wished they had more outtakes on it but I loved the DVD.But they have other cool stuff on the DVD,The making of the Goonies,Commmentary,The Goonies R Good Enough music video and theatrical trailer.Didn't we all want to move down to Astoria,Oregon after seeing this?I know I did,just so I could find that [great] waterslide.I hope like E.T.,that they bring back The Goonies to theaters for it's 20 anniversary,if they do,I'll be one happy kid to see my favourite kids movie in the theater for the first time.Have fun and remember for now and forever.THE GOONIES R GOOD ENOUGH!!!</p></body></html>

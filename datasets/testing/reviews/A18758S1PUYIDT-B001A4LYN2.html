<meta name="summary" content="Sort of watchable, with some serious flaws"></head><body><p>Okay, the three stars are for the cinematography, production design, and some of the acting.<br />Here are the flaws:<br />1.  the music is irritating and pervasive to the point of being a distraction.  We don't need to be manipulated with music; just tell the story.<br />2.  I assume Daniel Day-Lewis was doing the best he could with the "direction."  The same goes for Paul Dano, though I found his preacher-man over the top at times.  The wonderful Ciaran Hinds (I think it was him) is wasted in a tiny role. The only one I enjoyed watching was the young boy playing H.W.<br />3.  the tracking shots and several other shots linger too long.  This is a common problem with directors who are so enamored of their own work that they cannot bear to clip out a single frame in the editing room.<br />4.  The last part of the film is bizarre.  The milkshake/bowling alley scene is unintentionally funny, and we have no idea what happened between 1911 and 1927.  How did Daniel deteriorate so much?  And the last scene just leaves us wondering how long he's going to sit on the bowling lanes with a dead body.<br />Rent it on cheapo day, but don't pay full price.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>When initial reports about Danny Boyle's &quot;28 Days Later&quot; began filtering in to my headquarters, I exulted aloud about the possibilities of a resurgence of the zombie genre. Could we dare hope for a return to the days when films like Lucio Fulci's &quot;Zombie&quot; and the Romero pictures appeared with frightening regularity? Well, all hopes for more pictures featuring the walking dead, at least in the traditional sense, dimmed considerably after I finally watched this movie. Boyle's oeuvre commences with one slam-bang scene after another before settling down to a rather mundane series of events. An uneven movie in every respect, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; did not maintain this viewer's interest. This zombie picture does not improve significantly on the traditional shambling dead films of the 1970s and 1980s. History will consign it to the cinematic ash heap labeled with the &quot;They tried but could not quite pull it off&quot; tag. A true pity since the filmmakers actually explored a few intriguing ideas that should have worked.<p>Jim (Cillian Anderson) wakes up from a coma to an unfamiliar world. There does not seem to be anyone around, not in his room nor in the entire hospital. Wandering through the deserted corridors, all he finds is desolation and destruction. Litter drifts along the floors, chairs and equipment lie in heaps, and an eerie silence hangs oppressively. Jim's sense of awe about his surroundings grows by leaps and bounds as he walks out into the street. He finds no one, not a single, solitary living soul anywhere in the city. His footfalls echo down abandoned London streets as birds soar amidst the silent buildings. The occasional wrecked automobile and a bulletin board plastered inches deep with missing person notices hint at some sort of enormously ominous event having occurred while Jim slumbered on a gurney. With no other place to go in the immediate vicinity, he wonders into a church only to espy mounds of bodies heaped in the pews. Then, he hears a roar of rage. As Jim turns to flee the building, a priest lurches out of a shadowy doorway, moving strangely and mumbling unintelligibly. The man of the cloth suddenly charges our hero, and the game is afoot. As he races from the church and retreats down the street chased by several of these people, two strangers rescue him by heaving Molotov cocktails at the pursuers. Congratulations. You just finished watching the best part of &quot;28 Days Later.&quot;<p>Jim learns from his two saviors that a virus unleashed from a medical lab by a bunch of save the earth types swept England, turning ordinary citizens into frothing at the mouth zombies fueled by an boundless rage. The living attempted to leave the country even as the virus spread to points beyond the United Kingdom. As soldiers set up roadblocks throughout the country, civilization gave way to anarchy. After Jim learns his parents took the easy way out, and after a close call with one of the rage filled zombies that resulted in the demise of one of his rescuers, he and Selena (Naomie Harris) meet up with Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). The four set out for a checkpoint that is still sending a radio signal promising a cure. After a lengthy trip that bonds the four together, they discover that the soldiers at the military installation do not promise a cure. These motley men, led by a Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston), are largely content to defend their perimeter from the occasional zombie incursions. Moreover, as time goes by the men begin to show sinister interest in Selena and Hannah, much to the consternation of Jim. What started out as a promising film loaded with suspense rapidly disintegrates into a rather pedestrian attack on the big old bad military.<p>&quot;28 Days Later&quot; still sports heaping quantities of gore, solid performances from a mostly unknown cast, and a strong central premise. The idea that rage could one day turn people into mindless zombies is a good one. When you have zombies, you also have suspense, which Boyle realizes through several tension filled scenes in a dark tunnel and in an abandoned roadside marketplace (shades of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; in the latter). The use of digital cinematography works well by giving the movie a candy colored dream-like quality that makes the violence all the more effective when zombies burst on the scene out of nowhere. It's so heartbreaking that Boyle allowed the picture to turn into a by the numbers chase movie after the group arrives at the military base. The massive PR campaign launched when this film came out, and the attendant hubbub among the horror crowd, probably insures that a sequel could amble down the road in the near future. The conclusion of the film should quell rumors of a &quot;28 Days Later, Part 2&quot;-would they call it &quot;31 Days Later&quot;?-but always remember good box office receipts never stopped Hollywood from trying. <p>The DVD contains more extras than you would expect on a single disc. It offers commentaries, deleted scenes, a behind the scenes featurette, storyboards, a music video, galleries, and three disappointing alternate endings. One of these conclusions consists of nothing other than storyboards with voice-overs from the filmmakers. The other two offer nothing radically different from the one we get in the film. Thinking about the picture in retrospect, I am surprised that I cannot find the heart to recommend it. Horror fans will obviously see it no matter what anyone says, as I did, but moviegoers looking for a scary movie could do much better by choosing amongst a host of other similarly themed films that work much better than this one.</p></body></html>

Critics stated this was the best movie of all-time, I was very disappointed when I rented this movie. It was nothing like I thought it would be, yes Kate Hudson is glorious and mesmerizing as "band-aide" Penny Lane but the writing was boring and the other characters were so one-dimensional it was ridiculous! Crow hasn't directed or written great movies in the last decade, his best film is Say Anything, not Jerry Maguire or Vanilla Sky. The music is rockin' but Almost Famous had me singing another tune. Skip it.</p></body></html>

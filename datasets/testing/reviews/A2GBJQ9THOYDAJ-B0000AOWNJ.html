The actual gore is minimal; it even carries a PG-13 rating. The opening sequence, in which Naomi Watts's niece admits to having watched the fatal videotape, is reminiscent of all the girls-on-Elm-Street flicks, . . . and then, having sucked you in, the film will put you behind a double-locked door with all the lights turned on.</p></body></html>

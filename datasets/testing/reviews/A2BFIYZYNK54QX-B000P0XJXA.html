<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film of 2004, thus far..."></head><body><p>David Mamet is a  master of smoke and mirrors. He has demonstrated this time and time again through both his plays and films. In his films, he has demonstrated an uncanny ability to create a world where nothing is as it seems. Your friends are your enemies, your lovers are your killers, and vice versa. He also has a knack for dialogue, whichi is kind of like saying Michelangelo had a knack for ceiling painting. In &quot;Spartan&quot;, he displays a heretofore-unseen ability to make a very visual as well as a very well-written film. His other films, like &quot;House of Games&quot;, &quot;Heist&quot;, and &quot;Homicide&quot;, while being good (&quot;Heist&quot;) to great (&quot;House of Games&quot;, &quot;Homicide&quot;) have never displayed a strong visual language. But here he combines the best of all the film worlds with great acting, writing and directing. Kilmer, who almost always does brilliant work, does it again here with the portrayal of Scott, an extraordinary black ops agent for the US government who is brought in to assist in the safe retrieval of the kidnapped daughter of a politician who rates VERY HIGH on the food chain. -SPOILERS AHEAD- Scott is a singularly driven man who will do whatever he needs to to get the job done. In one shocking instance, he must kill a police officer and another man in order to gain the confidence of someone who may know where the girl is. He threatens to gouge out eyes, but with Scott, you know it's not just a threat. Sometimes he must mistreat the very people he's trying to protect in order to get the job done right. Of course, you have to remember this IS a David Mamet film, and the first rule of his films is that NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS. Even Scott, who as ruthless and task-oriented as he is, becomes a morally-challenged man when he is left out to dry by the people he serves. This film is a great companion piece to John Frankenheimer's &quot;Ronin&quot;, who Mamet co-wrote under a psudeonym, but if you watch &quot;Ronin&quot; again, you can hear and feel Mamet's influence, particularly in the dialogue. Anyway, both of these films are about the world of the covert operation, whether it's for a government or a pack of mercenaries, and neither of them have those spy-movie moments where the colloquialisms and slang of black-bag ops are not explained by a character to another character just so the audience knows what it means. Films rarely get more interesting, exciting, or exhilarating to watch as &quot;Spartan&quot;.</p></body></html>

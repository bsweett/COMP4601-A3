<meta name="summary" content="There Will Be Greed"></head><body><p>The many ways that greed manifests are countless in this film.  Virtually no character goes without claim on some level of selfishness when oil is discovered on otherwise useless California properties.  The lives of the inhabitants of a small farm community are turned upside down when the reality of what wealth can be gained dawns on them, as well as when they realize the price they will pay to have it.  The story is a believable exploitation of the land and lives of those striking out on the American frontier. Central to its conflict are Daniel Plainview, a slick oil prospector with the sincerity of a snake oil salesman, and Eli Sunday, the ambitious young pastor of a struggling country church.<br /><br />Day-Lewis Truly deserved all the accolades he won for his performance of Daniel Plainview in this film.  The range of his skills was wholly evident in this film, from the overall reserved and refined mannerisms of Plainview, to his later explosive and subtly vitriolic snide treatment of others.  In truth, every performance in this film was flawless.  In particular Paul Dano, Sunday, should have gotten more attention for his supporting role.  His passionate sermons were frightening and moving in his ability to swing from demure to suddenly thundering.  The physicality he brought to the character was entrancing as much as creepy.  I'm excited to think of what work he will do from this point forward.<br /><br />Overall the direction of the film seemed to be spot-on in delivery.  Most impressive to me were the great gaps in dialogue.  I'm always impressed when a scene is forced to move forward without speech.  That said, I'm not quite sure to what the poor pacing and seeming gaps in sequencing should be attributed.  In some places the film moved quite slowly, while sudden artless segu&eacute;s seemed to leave out huge chunks of time and plot development.  I also found the score to be extremely distracting throughout most of the film.  Indeed it was innovative and not what one would expect in a western...  Still, the musical arrangements were not only ill-suited for a lot of the film, but they were flat out too loud in much of it.<br /><br />All-in-all, the film is well done.  It will be a feather in the cap of its cast, even if the final cut was a bit dodgy.</p></body></html>

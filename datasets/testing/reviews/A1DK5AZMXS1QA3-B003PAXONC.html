<meta name="summary" content="Great premise, good acting, too many dumb scenes"></head><body><p>I Am Legend is another action flick release by Will Smith.  This time Mr. Smith stars as Robert Neville, a US military scientist who helped create a virus-based vaccine against cancer that ends up becoming contagious, spreading to the entire human population, killing of 90% of humans, and turning most of the survivors into cannibalistic, light-hating creatures; i.e. vampire - zombies called Darkseekers.  Most of the movie takes place in New York City, specifically in Neville's town home, and in the streets and buildings of Manhattan.<br /><br />The drawbacks of the movie are primarily in the plot; specifically there are some very dumb scenes.  Probably the biggest is the lack of firepower wielded by Dr. Neville.  We learn in the movie that Dr. Neville happens to be an Army officer.  We also see that Dr. Neville has been living alone in NYC for several years, often fighting of Darkseekers.  Dr. Neville also has a lot of time every single day to drive thru the city, stop of at music and DVD stores to "rent" movies and CD's, arrange various store mannequins to provide him "company", play golf, and chase animals that have escaped from the local zoos.  Yet in the entire movie, Dr. Neville has only three guns on him, an automatic rifle, and two handguns.  For someone living in a city full of zombies that want to eat him, who has military training, and who has a lot of time to acquire firearms in a city that must be full of gun shops, I would think Dr. Neville would be loaded with guns.  In the final scene when the Darkseekers storm his house, he uses a grand total of 1 gun with 1 clip, and 1 grenade.  This is preposterous.  I would have hundreds of firearms in that house, several per room, with lots of ammunition clips around.<br /><br />A second stupid scene in the movie is when Dr. Nevill falls into the Darkseekers' trap and gets strung up by his leg.  For a sober Army officer to fall into such a simple trap is ludicrous and mind-boggling.<br /><br />Probably the dumbest part of the movie is why doesn't Dr. Neville start demolishing the hiding places of the Darkseekers.  He clearly knows how to construct and use explosives, as shown in the movie's climax.  And he clearly has the time to do this, so why does he not start blowing up various dark spots throughout the city as a way of clearing out the Darkseekers?<br /><br />So all in all, this is a movie with a great premise and good acting, but some big plot holes that lead to very stupid scenes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I'll be back"></head><body><p>Terminator DVD<br /><br />In doing research for this review, I was surprised to learn that Arnold was not the first choice to play the protagonist.<br /><br />Mel Gibson was the first choice, but turned it down (he thought it just a rehash oh his Mad Max movies)<br /><br />O.J. Simpson was considered, but was turned down, because he had a nice guy image (boy how that has changed).<br /><br />Anyhow, I rememberber thinking, after I saw this movie for the first time.  "WOW, how do you kill this thing?"<br /><br />Highly recommended for Arnold fans and Science Fiction fans<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008</p></body></html>

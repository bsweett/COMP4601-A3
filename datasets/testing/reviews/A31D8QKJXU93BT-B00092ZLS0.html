<meta name="summary" content="Ready or Not"></head><body><p>This expert DVD transfer includes a commentary tract and four alternate endings, two of which are actually better than the one director John Polson chose, calling his judgment into question. But he has made so many other wrong choices that the holes in this original script are the least of the picture's  problems. What is absolutely right about it, however, is the remarkable child actress Dakota Fanning in the leading role. She not only carries "Hide and Seek" but she steals it easily from top-billed Robert DeNiro.<br /><br />What is one of our finest actors doing in this ho-hum psychological thriller anyway? Not much. DeNiro seems to be channeling the confrontational Travis Bickle of "Taxi Driver"  into a widowed New York psychologist who takes his nine-year-old daughter, traumatized by her mother's suicide, to a woodsy hamlet to cure her. Of course, matters get worse (surprise!), more for the audience than any of the characters. Well, they suffer, too, mostly at the hands of the little girl's imaginary friend. Yes, she has one of those, and you also won't be surprised when she sees creepy things go bump in the night.<br /><br />At least she doesn't see dead people, although a "Sixth Sense" might have helped this movie, which doesn't play fair (note the scene in which a visiting friend is murdered.) The film is filled with red herrings, plot inconsistencies, loud sound effects, spooky music, and some competent supporting actors, including Dylan Baker as the sheriff and Amy Irving as the mother whose flashbacked story is clumsily edited. You wonder what Brian DePalma might have done with this material. Probably discard it and start from scratch.</p></body></html>

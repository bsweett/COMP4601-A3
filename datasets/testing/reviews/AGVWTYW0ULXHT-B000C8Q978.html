<meta name="summary" content="The past is gone, the future is not yet, so this is it ... a subtle and inventive existential road trip adventure"></head><body><p>Near the end of this film, a young man who might be Don Johnston's (Bill Murray's) son asks for a bit of philosophical wisdom from a fellow traveler.  What he gets (see the title for this review) is not original but probably appropriate for one who gets described by almost everyone else as a "Don Juan."  That is, of course, the idea behind the famous romancer: that romantic love and sex are all about the here and now (that is why romantic love and marriage are such uneasy "bed partners": the best that romantic love can offer is an unimaginable "happily ever after" because the real future is not so romantic).<br /><br />The response, "what are you, a Buddhist?" is a deliberate jab on the part of Jarmusch at this philosophical approach that says everything and nothing.  The irony is that this film will likely be appreciated for its moments more than for what I take to be its underlying critique of the "philosophy of the moment" (a version of an existentialist philosophy).<br /><br />Because Don lives in the moment, he cannot really act -- he has no character.  What he does is merely a reaction to those he is  with -- he is for others just what they expect to see in him.  He lets his actions be dictated to him by his neighbor.  He never describes himself in this film but is described by others: as a Don Juan, as Don Johnson, as a rich man, as a computer guy.  It's significant for this question of labels that Don made his money in computers but refuses to have one in his house.  That would define him.  He doesn't like any labels to stick: even when he thinks he's found his son he tells him not that he is his father but merely admits that he might seem like that to the boy.  (This issue of labelling is fairly complex in the film: most everyone in the film can be labeled and even accepts a label - Lolita, the real estate agent, the pet communicator; note though that Don's neighbor isn't easily labeled -- he's a Jamaican family man with three jobs who fancies himself a detective but whose daughter insists he can't be identified with any of the "famous detective" labels that Don tries to pin on him.)<br /><br />The idea of having a son is precisely what he has to reject if he is going to hold on to his philosophy: because to be a father is to have an inescapable past, a moment that defines you essentially in relation to another person, and to have a future that is bound up with the vicissitudes of that other person's life.  At the end of the film, though, in the first real show of feeling and passion Don begins to want such a connection -- as if in despair over his own lack of identity.  The ambiguity of the ending captures this despair in a simple and powerful way.  A very fine film, well worth the ride -- with an incredibly cool Jamaican jazzy soundtrack.</p></body></html>

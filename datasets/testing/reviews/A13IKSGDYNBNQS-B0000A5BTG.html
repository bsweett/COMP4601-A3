<meta name="summary" content="Really poor"></head><body><p>This film is a great example of an awful Hollywood blockbuster. Its hangs together on the worst kind of cliches, and as previous reviewers have said, has no scientific basis at all. At the start its not that bad. The crew of a space shuttle have to land in the middle of L.A. because of the start of the Earths core slowing down, which leads the Shuttles guidance systems astray. This is done quite well although the CGI special effects aren't that great. From there its a rapid decent, excuse the pun.<br /><br />The film is reminisent of Armageddon in style, and amazingly probably not as good, because its even more scientifically unlikely. Quite why Hilary Swank decided to do this film is beyond me. However she and Bruce Greenwood (so good in Thirteen Days as JFK) are the only redeeming features. If you loved Armegeddon you will probably love this, so if in doubt rent it first!</p></body></html>

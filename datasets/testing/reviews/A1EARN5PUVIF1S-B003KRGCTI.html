<meta name="summary" content="The Twilight Zone Episode You Never Saw"></head><body><p>Of the two post-apocalyptic movies released in the last year -- "The Book of Eli" and "The Road" -- I think I enjoyed "Eli" much more.<br /><br />That's because it plays almost like a Twilight Zone episode -- or the first "Planet of the Apes" movie, written if my memory serves me by Rod Serling -- with a neat twist (or two or three) at the end.<br /><br />"Eli" is beautifully photographed in bleak shades of brown, and it features an excellent cast, with splendid turns by Denzel as the bad-ass survivor on a sacred mission, Gary Oldman as the villain Carnegie, and Mila Kunis as, well, the eye candy (and eventually Eli's companion on his journey).<br /><br />The fight scenes are topnotch as well, and not too bloody, considering the amount of carnage.<br /><br />I have deducted a star only because of the absence of extras on the DVD.  This practice must stop!  Presumably the studio will release an enhanced version in five or ten years featuring the extras that should have been included from day one.<br /><br />So you might want to rent this or borrow it from your public library first.  And buy it when the "deluxe" edition finally and inevitably hits the shelves.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a much better film than the grumpy critics allowed, but my favorites, Ebe and Gliebe (Roger Ebert and Owen Glieberman) liked it, and my faith in the opinions of those esteemed gentleman was again rewarded.</p></body></html>

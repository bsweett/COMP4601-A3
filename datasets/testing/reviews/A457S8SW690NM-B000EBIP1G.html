Lewis' books were my faves as a child and were packed with Christian symbolism. Aslan symbolized a Christ figure who was killed and then resurrected. Lucy's little healing potion would be the blood of christ, etc..<br /><br />Although I haven't read the books in 4 or 5 years, I remember really having enjoyed them. I can't say the same about the movie. While it does have some very good apspects, it mostly struggles and is in the end too Disney.<br /><br />Most of the people watching it are watching it for the entertainment and not to see how true it was to the books. Most people, such as little children, wouldn't have noticed the religious aspects or really have cared about them.<br /><br />So, all religious aspects aside, this movie isn't the most entertaining. It's in all fariness boring at times and has plenty of cheesy one liners.<br /><br />First off, the world of Narnia just isn't very well made. It wasn't like I would have expected and the path from the real world to there is lame. They just go in the closet, pass the coats and BOOM! they're in the world of Narnia. Then Lucy meets mister Tubmus and I couldn't help but see some bizarre aspects when seeing him. Just his facial expressions, the way he talks to Lucy, etc.. just makes him out as a "you know what". With all of that going on in the world now, I couldn't help but notice how bizarre his movements and actions were. All that aside, the child acting is fair at best. Lucy was good but I could have really seen Dakota Fanning in her role.<br /><br />The White Witch was well made and the acting there was nice. Aslan was the best part of the movie and was stunning (until you see King Kong.). Liam Neeson did a nice job as him also.<br /><br />Aslan was the best part of the movie by far. Then, the beavers and wolves talking were well made and funny and sarcastic at times. As for the rest, well, it was a long ride, very childish and the world of Narnia was just too peaceful for the White Witch and her army to live there.<br /><br />There is no humor despite Disney's harsh efforts at throwing in one liners. In the end, you'll be wanting more and it just wasn't a very good interpretation of the book. It made me feel that it was just too Disney.<br /><br />The PG rating hurts it too. The huge battle scene at the end can't reach its peak like say The Lord of the Rings due to the rating. PG-13 might have helped eliminate the cheesiness.<br /><br />And then when Aslan tells Peter to clean the blood off his sword, um, what blood?<br /><br />Narnia was a fair movie but not at all as good as it said to be. Sure the kids will like it but honestly, I was very dissapointed.<br /><br />And, I just didn't feel that it brought C.S. Lewis' world to life, which is a shame. It's definitely not worth an evening admission, maybe worth a matinee but I'd just wait to see it on DVD. But, for those of you that haven't read the books, it will defintely be a better movie because you won't know how average it is compared to the book.<br /><br />It will leave you dissapointed and the special effects won't blow you away. What were all of these rave reviews for?</p></body></html>

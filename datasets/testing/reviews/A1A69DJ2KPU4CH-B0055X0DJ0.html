Just saw it for the first time last night (I rarely go out to the movies so as to avoid the rude masses that usually attend them) and it is so extreme I felt compelled to throw up a review. Let's get a couple of things out of the way right now:<br /><br />1. Characters - Incredibly annoying. Shia LaBeouf is the most annoying of them all. His constant hyper over the top delivery gets old, and, not to be redundant, but annoying! He needs to start drinking decaf because he is way too much to take for an entire movie, especially a 2.5 hour movie. Sam's parents are throw away characters, his new college roomate is almost as annoying as he is, and even the normally likeable John Turturro is silly in this movie. Megan Fox, well what are you going to say about her, she could probably spend the entire movie with drool coming out of her mouth and she would still be super hot. This movie exploits her hottness and for that I congratulate them (director, producer etc.). Even my girlfriend who is beautiful in her own right has to admit Megan Fox is super beautiful. For the males in the audience she is a big plus for this movie (and the previous Transformer's movie too).<br /><br />2. Plot - What plot?<br /><br />3. Writing - Dumb, ridiculous, and nonsensical.<br /><br />So, how do you give a movie that has poor acting, annoying characters, zero plot to speak of, and a poor script five stars? Well easy, what it does right it does really right, and that happens to be special effects and explosions, lots and lots and lots of explosions! This movie won't make you smarter, it won't leave you to contemplate life and your purpose here, it won't make you feel sad or happy, all it will do is dazzle you and probably exhaust you with non-stop action and dazzling special effects. CGI for the robots is incredible. Yes, when they do their transforming bit and occasionally during battle scenes it's really difficult to tell what the heck is going on, but for the most part these things are incredible. The transformers that show up at the end of the movie for the big battle (and I do mean big) in Egypt are quite the show, they are simply enormous. For a little comic relief there are two twin robots and they cracked me up! They have big ears and teeth and they are constantly fighting with each other, but they made me laugh with their constant banter and goofiness.<br /><br />While I haven't read any of them I noticed this movie got lots of bad reviews, not sure why, not sure what people will expecting out of a transformers movie? If they were expecting high art, a plot, good acting, or any of that other stuff that normally constitutes a good movie I think their expectations were way out of line. If you approach this movie with the frame of mind of "entertain me, I want to grab my box of popcorn and I want you to entertain me with high production values, incredible special effects, lots of stuff blowing up, and non-stop action," well you will be very satisfied indeed. For what it was I loved it, there isn't a dull moment. My girlfriend hated, I loved it. Definitely a movie made with guys as the target audience.<br /><br />I do want to add I'm no Transformers fan. I did not watch the Transformers cartoons when I was kid, I haven't read any Transformer comic books (I'm assuming there are some?) and I didn't know anything about them until I saw the first movie (which I also loved). So if you're a Transformers fanboy snob who knows, maybe you'll hate this movie for whatever reasons fanboys hate movies about their favorite characters. As a non fan with no previous affiliation or emotional investment in the series, for me it was just great entertainment.<br /><br />Final word, best popcorn movie I've seen in years!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Eli Roth is a very sick man"></head><body><p>You'll rarely find a mainstream horror film that's gorier or more intense than Eli Roth's Hostel.  When Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his two pot smoking pals go in search of sex and drugs, they get much, much more than they bargained for, as one by one they get captured and unbelievably and brutally tortured.  That's about as far as the story goes, but there's no need for Hostel to go any farther because Roth more than makes his point.  The film is more of a throwback to the exploitation films of the 70's, focusing less on story and character development and more on sickening gore effects and shocks.  And Roth is not afraid to let his camera linger and not cut away (the eye extraction scene will make you squirm like you won't believe).  Quentin Tarantino executive produced, and his hand can be felt in the final, revenge driven sequences.  Those who grew up with the aforementioned films will find plenty to admire with Hostel, but for those who have been weaned on teeniebopper, Scream-horror or PG-13 Japanese remakes, this should be avoided.  The DVD has a surprising amount of extras, particularly commentaries by Roth and Tarantino, which in itself is a real treat.</p></body></html>

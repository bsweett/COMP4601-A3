The backgrounds have a lush intricate medieval design while the characters seem to float through each scene effortlessly. I found the movie to be especially calming and filled with luminous beauty. Each scene is exquisite, like a painting in motion. The handmade animation has been restored to a new level of brilliance. The colors are gorgeous and keep your attention even more than the storyline, which is a bit slow in places.<br /><br />The basic story revolves around three good fairies who protect princess Aurora for sixteen years. Nothing too interesting happens until Maleficent (an evil fairy) transforms herself into a dragon and then the story finally has a formidable villain, which makes it a bit more exciting. However, prince Phillip seems unable to slay Maleficent until he is helped by the three good fairies. They keep the story alive and fresh with all their magic. It is fun to watch them triumph over evil. Still, the fairies are not able to undo Maleficent's curse on the princess Aurora who falls into a deep sleep after pricking her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle created by the evil fairy. The only way she can awaken is to receive a kiss from her true love. Maleficent tries to make this an impossibility, but somehow good overcomes evil in the end.<br /><br />Since this was my first time to see Sleeping Beauty I had never realized it was a story about an arranged marriage. Fortunately princess Aurora meets prince Phillip in the forest before the wedding takes place. To me, princess Aurora looked twenty not sixteen. The only other difference from the story I heard as a child was that Princess Aurora doesn't sleep for a hundred years. Everything else was exactly as I imagined it to be. This movie has a perfection that is rare and beautiful and it is definitely a movie worth collecting.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></body></html>

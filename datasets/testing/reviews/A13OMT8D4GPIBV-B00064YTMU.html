<meta name="summary" content="Star Driven, But Wonderfully Crafted"></head><body><p>Michael Mann's feature Collateral is a big, star driven production that shines with a great storyline as well.  His very own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006J28KU">Heat (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> was another star driven story with a wonderful plot.<br /><br />This time, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx star as the hapless individuals on one fateful night in LA.  Foxx stars as Max, a dream inspiring cab driver, and Cruise stars as Vincent, a smooth and calculated hitman.<br /><br />The two disc set features a commentary from director Michael Mann, around four or so featurettes detailing the visual FXs, acting, and others behind the film, and a deleted scene with commentary.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

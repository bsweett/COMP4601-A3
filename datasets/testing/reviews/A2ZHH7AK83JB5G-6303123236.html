<meta name="summary" content="Even a jaded Disney viewer should like Snow White"></head><body><p>I am often sickened by Disney's overpriced cheesy books, toys and other merchandise that are far from "classic" as well as their idiotic marketing ploy for their videos - the Disney vault. Yet when I watch a wonderful classic film like this all is forgiven. One caution the movie could be frightening to very young or fearful children. The Queen and her mirror are really scary as are her various plots to kill Snow White. I don't think the typical kid over seven would be afraid of it especially since there is so much comic relief from the dwarfs and the cuddly animals though the film is somewhat of a curious mix. I do find Snow White's singing and speaking voice annoying as well as her role of little homemaker but you have to remember she is a product of the late 1930's and appreciate the film as a hallmark of that time.</p></body></html>

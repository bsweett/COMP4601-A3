It ain't an Oscar calibre performance (ala Denzil Washington's corrupt cop turn in the great Training Day) that we find Cruise giving to his lead man in the movies status. But you will find Tom's performance interesting and you get the feel that if he does another bad guy, it will become an Oscar conten-dah. Do you wanna know what I thought was pretty hilarious? Sister (Jada P.) is in a hi-rise office building alone and gets a frantic, frantic, frantic 'hey-hey-hey-there's-a-murderer-two-doors-down-from-you' call from the cabbie she just gave a card to and the first thing on her mind is 'why should I believe you and why should I trust you?'<br /><br />My humor however is weird.</p></body></html>

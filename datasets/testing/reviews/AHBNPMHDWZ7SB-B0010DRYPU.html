<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood's Return to the Genre that Made Him a Star"></head><body><p>For a long time, I was what many would consider the average moviegoer. I wasted my money crappy movies often, just because of a star that I liked, or a premise that seemed interesting. As much as I hate to admit it, I did not like Westerns for the life of me. I saw Appaloosa when it came out in theatres, and ironically liked it, albeit only a little. I then saw 3:10 To Yuma, and what do you know, I loved it. Still do. Finally, there came a point where I had to ask myself what my problem was, why I refused to give other Westerns a chance. I eventually blind bought the DVD and decided to watch, not only one of the classic films collecting dust on my shelf, but one of the greatest Westerns ever made. Unforgiven is very well done. Certainly deserving of the recognition it has received over the years. I'm actually glad that this movie won Best Picture. Clint Eastwood is obviously well known for his portrayal of cowboys back when Westerns owned the air waves. I love how he came back in the early 90's to show them he hadn't lost his touch with a six shooter, or Schofield rifle, or shotgun, etc. He was perfect, and played the role exactly as I would expect. But his character went through a change that I was not expecting.<br /><br />The movie progresses along at a slow pace, and calmly inches its way toward the thrilling conclusion. Throughout the film we hear repeatedly how much of a badass Bill Munny was back in his heyday. There wasn't much to show for it. When we first meet him he's falling all over his pigs. Later on down the line he gets a fever from a small beating and is asleep for three days. I started to think to myself that this guy needed to take his old behind back home before he got too deep into trouble. He was not in any shape to try to kill anyone. Slowly, but surely we meet the man. I'll leave it at that because it's nearly impossible to say more without spoiling anything. I'll just say that Clint's performance is enough to sit through this one, even without the fantastic supporting cast and subtle writing. Morgan Freeman was great as well. He played Bill's longtime friend and partner in crime, Ned. When a young man suddenly shows up on Bill's ranch asking him to help kill a couple of bad men for a bounty, Ned's place is the first stop Bill makes. Together Bill and Ned accompany the young man on this hit. I might as well call it a hit, instead of sugar coating it. Bill and Ned are assassins, hitmen. So they aren't very good men themselves. The young man, called "The Schofield Kid", is played by Jaimz Woolvett (a relatively unknown...to me anyway). He does great too.<br /><br />The whole cast is really good. Gene Hackamn plays a real jerk of a town sheriff, named Little Bill, and Richard Harris has a short, but meaningful role as English Bob. I should also mention that the whores were well played as well. I feel bad calling them that, but that's what everyone else in the movie called them. I really liked this cast. Clint Eastwood is a hell of a director. The shots are really nice to look at. This isn't his most beautifully shot film, but this cinematography will impress nonetheless. If Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy is even a fraction as good as Unforgiven, I cannot wait. I can rest assured that that was a worthwhile purchase, even for a non-Western fan like myself. I really look forward to seeing many more films in this genre hence forth. If you're like I was, and doubt you'll be interested in movies like this one, stop it. Just give Unforgiven a chance and see for yourself. I highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

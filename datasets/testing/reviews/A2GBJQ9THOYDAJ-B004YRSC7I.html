The whole world, you discover, is subjective. Short-term memory loss means you can lie to your later self and Christopher Nolan, who wrote and directed. makes the most of the possibilities. For one thing, there are no big-name stars (Carrie-Anne Moss from the _Matrix_ movies is as close you come) so you can concentrate on the story, and on the confusion that inevitably strikes the first-time viewer. And there are some problems: For instance, who the hell is Dodd? Can you believe Teddy's explanation? Inevitably, as in life, there are no absolude answers. And, as with _Pulp Fiction,_ _Mulholland Drive,_ and a few other recent non-linear films, you'll enjoy this one more as you re-watch it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A nice surprise"></head><body><p>When I sat down to watch this movie, I wasn't expecting much.  Reviews from this movie release turned me off from seeing it even though I enjoyed the first two installments.  To my surprise, this was actually a very good movie...as far as superheroes go.  Sure, I was stunned by Professor X's and Cyclops early departure, especially since it comes at the hands Gray/Phoenix.  I was surprise that Wolverwine doesn't exhibit any guilt.  If he hadn't set Phoenix loose in the first place, none of this would have happened.  Berry's Storm as usual was boring, Rogue, I always thought was a boring mutant.  Honestly, I thought the boy was going to be the answer to curing Phoenix, since no one's powers work around him, but it doesn't seem that answer occured to anyone.  So we bring Gray back just to kill her again.  I love the explanation to how she returned: "I don't know".  Alrighty then.  Why not just have her say "because the screenwriters said so"?  Still, this was an entertaining installment BUT it definitely needs to end here.</p></body></html>

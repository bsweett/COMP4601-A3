Caroline (Kate Hudson) is a Hospice employee who eventually gets fed up with her job and finds an ad in the paper that fits her financial needs. Once she is moved in she begins exploring the spooky old plantation and uses the skeleton key to discover a deep dark secret in the attic. A good movie filmed in a perfect setting, will keep you guessing till the end. Once it is over you have to think about it to understand the mastermind behind this thriller. I thought this movie had a great twist in it. The acting was great and the overall look and feel of the film was well developed. This thriller/mystery is entertaining and worth the watch.</p></body></html>

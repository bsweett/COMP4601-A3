<meta name="summary" content="Nice Christmas movie"></head><body><p>I really liked the animation. I've read where people call it creepy. Sure, the people aren't perfect but in a few years filmmakers will make it better. The main character reminds me of what Toby Maguire might have looked like as a kid. And the little poor boy looked like a composite of Haley Joel Osment (who sees dead people) and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey the youngest in Malcolm In The Middle).<br /><br />My favorite part was the the lost ticket flying around and the roller coaster ride. That had to be fun to watch in the theater. What I did find creepy was when the elves was waiting for Santa and they were singing a slow reverent version of "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town". It looked like a cult. Like a bunch of Moonies congregated. Besides that scene, I thought the movie was delightful.</p></body></html>

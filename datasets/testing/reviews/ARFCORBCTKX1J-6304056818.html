Its influence on popular science-fiction entertainment cannot be overestimated.<br /><br />The seeds of "Star Trek" are planted here, particularly the use of the ship's captain, executive officer, and surgeon as the principal players. So too is the conceit that the purpose of outer-space travel is to explore inner space -- the human condition. The desire to dress female space travelers in skimpy costumes isn't ignored, either.<br /><br />What makes "Forbidden Planet" such a standout is not that it was the first color science-fiction film (it wasn't), nor that it was the first "good" science-fiction film ("The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "Things to Come" come to mind), but rather the lavishness of the production and the unbridled imagination behind it. "Forbidden Planet" catches the viewer right from the start, with a nifty flying saucer and the greatest robot in movie history, in just the first 15 minutes. The visual effects (particularly of the ship passing behind Altair IV to produce an eclipse, and the surface of Altair IV) were state-of-the-art then, and more-convincing-than-not 54 years later.<br /><br />Also novel is the fact that the huge (for its time) $4M+ budget is in service of what is an intellectual story about whether man is basically good or evil, and whether we have the right to "play God". ("Forbidden Planet" owes a great deal to written science-fiction, and little to comic strips or previous films.) It's all dressed up with an ironic/sarcastic robot, and undressed-down with Anne Francis in mini-skirts that leave little to the imagination -- but "FP" is not the special-effects extravaganza we expect modern science-fiction films to be.<br /><br />This might explain why it's taken so long for "Forbidden Planet" to appear on Blu-ray, especially as there was an earlier HD-DVD edition. It appears Warners doesn't think there's much of a market for it. The local Fry's received only /one/ copy, which had not been sold when I walked in around 12:30PM on 9/7. One of the sous-managers told me that many Fry's hadn't received /any/ copies.<br /><br />"Modern" (hah!) audiences might also have problems with "Forbidden Planet"'s less-than-stellar acting (Walter Pidgeon is the only A-list actor). The best performance comes, not surprisingly, from Marvin Miller. His Robby deftly alternates among ironic/sarcastic {"It promotes rust."), hurt ("Again?"), naive ("Stuff, sir?"), threatening ("Will you get in?"), and helpful ("May I be of service?").<br /><br />The script has more than its share of groaners. Though Cyril Hume (an American, not an Englishman), was a decent writer, he clearly failed to read the lines out loud as he wrote them, resulting in some unpleasantly clumsy dialog. (Walter Pidgeon wasn't a particularly good actor, but you can see him trying to improve some of the poorer lines.)<br /><br />Fred McLeod Wilcox's direction has the depth of tissue paper and the subtlety of a steam roller, though its general briskness helps a film that's more talk than action. Leslie Nielsen's delivery of the final line, in which he not only butchers the line, but practically swallows it, is wholly Wilcox's fault. Such poor delivery is (or was) common in American films, but this example is one of the very worst ("I see no enemy" in "Ben-Hur" being the other).<br /><br />"Forbidden Planet" has its problems, but any modern viewer who actually /enjoys/ the garbage turned out by modern film makers has no right to criticize. "Forbidden Planet" might not be "Amadeus" -- but it's /definitely/ not "There's Something About Mary".<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray edition... "Forbidden Planet" was shot on Eastmancolor, which, at that time, could not compete with Technicolor for sharpness or grain. (Technicolor had been abandoned at that point, anyhow.) Grain is sometimes visible, and the image is not as super-sharp as one might like. The transfer is from a composite negative, presumably the one used for the 50th-anniversary edition. As with that version, scenes with animation or static mattes show a significant drop in sharpness and color accuracy, and an increase in contrast. This is unavoidable, the price one pays for the rest of the film looking so good. I'd give it a B to B+ for HD image quality.<br /><br />There used to be a "real" stereo soundtrack for "Forbidden Planet", but the sound on this version appears to be panned mono. "Extras" include everything (I think) that came with the deluxe 50th-anniversary version (other than the metal box, lobby cards, and Robby figurine). These include the "sequel", "The Invisible Boy", an episode of the "The Thin Man" (which has a political twist surprising for its era), and several good "making of" featurettes. (For those interested, Anne Francis looks barely 56, let alone her actual 76.)<br /><br />Rush right out in a buying frenzy!</p></body></html>

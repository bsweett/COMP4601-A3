Her characterization of Queen Elizabeth is genius - every cell in her body becomes the powerful queen.  Cate Blanchett shows Queen Elizabeth's ability to change "masks" -  The queen who holds court shows her intelligence, strength, ruthlessness, yet has a sense of ironic humor.  The queen in private shows her emotions, love, and fears.  There are threats all around her.<br /><br />Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) appears on the scene and throws his cloak below her feet so she does not step in a puddle.  His dashing ways attract her as someone different from the boring duties of the Court.  He tells of exciting adventures with savages, brings strange exotic items from the New World:  potatoes and tobacco as well as a few Native Americans. her Court.  Sir Walter distracts and intrigues her - makes her weak, she knows her rules  as Queen, yet she needs him near.  He notes that he has named territory after the Virgin Queen "Virginia."<br /><br />She wants to focus on her responsibilities instead of personal matters.  Skullduggery and<br />treachery is all around.  There are fights on what religion should be practiced - an Armada that carries the Spanish Inquisition is coming to England to crush out the Protestants and make Catholicism the national religion. She depends on her advisor Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) to flush out her betrayers.  Her own cousin, Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) is plotting to have Elizabeth assassinated.<br /><br />Again, Cate Blanchett is riveting as Queen Elizabeth, and the movie revolves around her role.  The movie is excellent and the beautiful costumes, landscapes and sets frame the actress well.</p></body></html>

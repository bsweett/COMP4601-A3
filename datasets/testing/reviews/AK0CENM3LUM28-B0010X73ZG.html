The premise is fantastic - spooky mist rolls in, carrying horrifying monsters with it. Yet the actual execution is terrible - the dialogue will make you want to pierce your eardrums for relief and, really, is it too much to ask that human characters actually act like real humans? Apparently so. Here is a list of things that need to be removed from the movie.<br /><br />(1) Black people are not a monolithic group who automatically band together because of their shared skin color in times of turmoil and then promptly follow the stupidest person straight into peril. I was actually really disturbed by this development. Just my opinion.<br /><br />(2) Religious hysteria is compelling and interesting. 30+ minutes of preaching is NOT. Note to writers and directors: Americans do not need 80% of the Book of Revelations quoted at them. Believe me, most of us are familiar enough with the concepts, if not from personal experience at church, then from cultural icons like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0842329129">Left Behind</a>. Exposition is good. Ham-fisted repetition is not. Trust your audience.<br /><br />(3) Alpha males should not immediately begin shopping for their next wife in the face of a crisis. We know the wife is dead. He knows the wife is dead. But for the love of Pete, let's have a short grieving process before the "Are you going to be a good step-mother?" interviews begin.<br /><br />(4) Being an attractive female does not equal "good with kids", nor does it equal being an automatic volunteer to take over the alpha male's child for 95% of the ensuing crisis.<br /><br />(5) I actually liked the ending. I thought it was a brave attempt to face reality head-on. However, having said that, don't have a ridiculous cop-out ending to tack on to try to make the choice a blatantly false one. That's just cheap.<br /><br />These complaints aside, the monsters are creepy and it's not a bad ride if you put the Closed Captions on and fast forward through most of the dialogue. There's even some camp appeal here, which is why it's staying on our DVD shelf for a little longer, at lease. But there is much better out there.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

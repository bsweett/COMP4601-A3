<meta name="summary" content="Not Bad, but Not Great either"></head><body><p>Hitch brings to the screen the story of a consultant who helps guys on their dates.  Things get a bit more complicated when he finds himself in need of help...<br /><br />It is not very unique, nevertheless, it is quite pleasant.<br /><br />The major setback is in relation to the choice for lead actress, which was poor at best; this film does not seem to be her thing, and she is not very likable.  Overall, she is not convincing in her role.<br /><br />Aside from that, the setting and the plot are pretty good!<br /><br />In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it.  3? Stars</p></body></html>

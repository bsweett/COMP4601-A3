<meta name="summary" content="Old fashioned horror movie that gets under your skin"></head><body><p>A brother and sister, heading home on college break down a highway that looks like the never ending "route 66" have a encounter with a big, black, ugly van that holds an evil presence, in the form of a part man, part bat and part devil/evil.<br />I do have to say that this isn't your usual horror, cut-em-up, splatter flick. It actually is a creepy, spooky, intelligent scare movie with fantastic acting.<br />Because the main characters are teenagers the basis for this old fashioned horror has elements of innocence, fear, and the overt feeling that these kids are really terrified and alone in their nightmarish isolation.<br />This movie really got under my skin because it delves into the true psychological nature of what truly terrifies us----"the unknown."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cheadle's Performance is Flawless"></head><body><p>Every actor in this film is excellent and delivers a rather understated performances.  Perhaps it's because the harrowing and tragic tale is something the real-life people portrayed here have come accustomed to somehow and that is a tragic commentary in of itself.  In any event, this film while filled with excellent supporting actors belongs to its lead, Don Cheadle who earned a Best Actor nod for this performance (and should have won hands down).<br /><br />Cheadle has been building an impressive resume with memorable supporting roles in which he nearly eclipses his leads.  He began his career on TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHJ6">Picket Fences - Season 1</a> and remainded on the show for it's entire run and eventually emerged as the star of it.  He then went on to cool roles like in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630528072X">Volcano</a> with Tommy Lee Jones and facinating and complex roles such as in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a>, but nothing compares to his quiet, restrained performance in this film that I can only compare his role and delivery of it to Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225857">To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)</a> in which both actors have the challenging task of exhibiting what I call "quiet courage" under great calamity and showing their great love and compassion for others without exactly "showing" it.  It's all in their subtle gestures, whispered dialogue, and revealing eyes.  Both films remind me of that old adage teachers like myself live by, "no cares how much you know until they know how much your care."<br /><br />I, like other reviewers here, went into this film knowing nothing about the topic.  I rented it based upon my respect of Don Cheadle and the positive reviews that surrounded this film when it was released.  Again, I knew nothing about the topic of the film itself and was I shocked by the events that unfolded in the film.  It is truly a harrowing tale told with great respect and dignity.  I found no silly cliches or trite treatment of this compelling and important event in history.<br /><br />This film is outstanding and it that will move you and stay with you long after the experience of viewing it is over.</p></body></html>

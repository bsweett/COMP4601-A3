Will Ferrell can execute some very funny moments in his films, especially in "Elf."  However, when he's given free reign in a film, as he was in this and also in "Anchorman," Ferrell seems to skip the part about trying to be funny and attempts to be all out silly.  This leaves the viewer wondering why much of the dialogue between his character and the rest in the film often makes no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />In "Talladega Nights," Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, an idiot who "wants to go fast" and lives by the code his deadbeat father gave him at career day in his school:  "If you're not first, you're last."  With this standard in tow, Ricky becomes the top racer in NASCAR, thanks to the help of his best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly).  In the wings, however, is one Jean Girard (Sasha Baron Cohen), a Formula One racer who is determined to take over NASCAR and eliminate Ricky Bobby.  Well, that's what seems to be Girard motive, but there is another reason he is in NASCAR that is revealed later in the film.  After a terrible accident, Ricky Bobby loses his will to win, his wife, and his home.  His friend, Cal, takes his wife, his home, and the NASCAR spotlight. Ricky and his two sons head for Ricky's hometown, where he moves back in with his mother.  While living with his mom, Ricky learns that he needs to quit trying to impress others and do things for himself.  His useless father also drifts into town and teaches him how to be a real racer.  It all boils down to Talladega, where Ricky Bobby faces his old best friend and his new French foe.<br /><br />The story is just plain silly.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it all feels forced upon the viewer.  It's as if Ferrell is saying, "It's me, Will Ferrell, laugh!"  I have nothing against Ferrell, but he just isn't funny in this flick.  It features ex-SNL buddies, David Koechner and  Molly Shannon.  Koechner never was funny on SNL in my opinion, and he does nothing to improve his status with me here.  Shannon has a minor role but makes the most of it and is one of the few bright spots in the film.  Gary Cole plays Ferrell's father and had he had better lines to work with, he would have done a better job.  John C. Reilly is good, but he is so much better in other films.  Sasha Baron Cohen is wasted here.  He's much funnier than this flick would imply.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoyed Ferrell in "Anchorman," you'll probably find this film to be hilarious.  I personally just don't care for it.  If you're a NASCAR fan, I'm sure you can enjoy the ribbings poked at you and your sport, but there must be something better out there.<br /><br />Mildly recommended to comedy fans.</p></body></html>

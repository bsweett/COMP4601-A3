<meta name="summary" content="Saving the Gold Standard?"></head><body><p>This film starts with James Bond 's trip to Miami to investigate Auric Goldfinger (an exotic locale for many in the audience). The purpose is to examine the suspected illegal trade in gold bullion, which contravenes the official monopoly, and can affect the currencies of the Free World. Gold, like diamonds, is produced in South Africa to benefit their mine owners and political allies.<p>It starts by showing Goldfinger cheating at cards: he's not a gentleman! This is a sign of a villain. The actor was chosen to match the description in the novel, not for political correctness. Bond arranges a golf match, flashes a gold bar, and out-cheats the cheater (to show moral superiority?). Would any secret agent act in such a manner? Following Goldfinger to Switzerland, Bond discovers the means used to smuggle gold - like in "The French Connection". Discovery leads to action, and a car chase, then capture. Like other such scenes, it fills up time but does not advance the plot. This chase is without dialogue, so you can read into it what you will. (I wonder if this chase was copied from the Keystone Kops?) The film then shows an industrial laser, a novelty at the time, being used in violation of Federal safety regulations.<p>Bond is flown to Baltimore, avoids Customs, then arrives in Kentucky. Normal prosaic life forms a background to villainy, as in a Hitchcock movie. We see the squadron that will play a part in the attack on Fort Knox. While it may be impossible to quickly steal all this gold, there is another way to make it unavailable to America, and cause the price of gold to skyrocket. Manipulating the supply, whether of oil or electricity, can be very profitable when there is no substitute. The criminals who help in this scheme are paid off then their job is done. The vehicles used tell of corporate placement. To reflect changing political relations, the other villains in this film are Red Chinese.<p>The squadron flies over and releases the binary nerve gas (a proposed weapon of war at the time, like SDI today). The nuclear device is then planted in the bowels of Fort Knox. Of course, this scheme is foiled by the superhuman action of James Bond. The gold supply of America, and the Free World, are saved from economic catastrophe.<p>Henry A. Zeiger's book "Ian Fleming The Spy Who Came in With the Gold" provides a literary analysis in the last chapter. Read it to understand Fleming's novels. These stories only work if you don't think about the plot.<p>Watching this 1965 film is eerie after 9/11/2001. Foreign conspirators exploding a dirty bomb to damage and terrorize America? Aided by those who learned to fly in America? Controlled by a wealthy and evil foreigner to profit from the disaster? Using a poison gas? How incredible in those days!</p></body></html>

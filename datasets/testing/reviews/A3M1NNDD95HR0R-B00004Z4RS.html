<meta name="summary" content="Where It All Began"></head><body><p>When this movie first came out, it was like "FINALLY!  X-Men on the big screen!"  Had they attempted to pull it off when X-Men was first invented in the early 60's, it would have fallen short, but modern special effects and filming techniques complemented the movie nicely.  And Wolverine, one of the most popular and awesome superheroes of all time, gets played by someone PERFECT for the role... Hugh Jackman!  Come to think of it, I have no complaints regarding the entire cast selection.  If you like superheroes and action movies, you owe it to yourself to watch X-Men.  And bonus, they made a sequel, and a third for us to enjoy!  I can't wait to watch it again...</p></body></html>

At times, Berry as Catwoman was dark - even when fighting her love interest, Benjamin Bratt. Why in the world would she be trying to hurt him? I understand that he was trying to arrest her, but there were better ways for her to escape than by knocking him around. I'm sorry, but donning that mask doesn't change her personality, any more than when Batman puts his mask on his personality changes. Bruce Wayne IS Batman, in suit or out.<br /><br />Given the films we've seen lately (for example, Spider-Man, 1 or 2), the special effects were heinous. When Catwoman was bounding from wall to wall it you could see the generated effects, and you're not supposed to. Again, especially not today. When Sharon stone fell, at one point in her fall you could actually see that it wasn't a person - it looked like Raggedy Ann dressed in white.<br /><br />To have a successful movie that involves a comic book hero, you need a good villain, a good plot, and something to care about. This had none of the aforementioned. The villain was a company and it's male C.E.O. trying to market a product that could potentially scar women for life (and what a ridiculous product name that was - Beau-line). Then the villain became his wife. A plot twist? I suppose so, but an entirely ridiculous one. Sharon Stone's character claimed that she had been using Beau-line for years. How is that possible? They're only just now getting ready to release the product. A product goes through years of research and testing, with trial and error, until the formula comes out right. So she's been using it during the research and testing period? Not likely.<br /><br />The plot - who cared? Did anyone really care about Beau-line? Of course not! I *cared* about the Green Goblin and Doc Ock. I cared about the Joker in the first Batman movie, and definitely about Catwoman in the second (Michelle Pfeiffer, for what it matters, completely outperformed Berry in the role). There was some serious tension between these superheroes and their villains. But how could tension be created through the wiles of a corporation?<br /><br />Also, how did the mild mannered little girl who was frightened of everything, it seems (but who walked out on a ledge to save a cat - um, duh?) manage to have that revolting leather costume in her closet? Seriously, that was deplorable.<br /><br />What's very interesting about certain statistics regarding this film is that on pro.imdb.com (the professional version of the Internet Movie DataBase), those who liked the movie most, in each age category, were women. I was surprised, as I thought adolescent boys would be much more interested. Perhaps not enough adolescent boys subscribe to pro.imdb.com.<br /><br />Also, this movie won 4 Razzie awards: worst actress, worst director, worst picture, and worst screenplay. It was also nominated for three others.<br /><br />The only reason I rented this was to see how truly bad it was. I think that it may have been worse than I expected it to be.</p></body></html>

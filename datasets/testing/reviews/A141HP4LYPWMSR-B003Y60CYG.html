<meta name="summary" content="Life Is A Stage  ~  Much More For Some Than Others"></head><body><p>`A Prairie Home Companion' released in `06 takes a nostaligic look at the bygone days of live radio as it chronicles the ficticious last performance of a country music variety show. With the exception of the brief opening and closing scenes the entire film takes place within the confines of an old Midwest theater. You see the onstage broadcast in it's entirety along with numerous glimpses backstage observing the performers interacting.<br /><br />While the music is infectious I found the storyline to be contrived, quite obscure and disjointed. As the evening progresses the performers one by one learn that they are doing their last show. The hatchet man who is closing down the theater is expected to make an appearance sometime during the evening and along with that dire expectation strange things begin to happen. One performer dies, a young girl writes poetry about death and suicide  while an unidentified blonde woman in a white trench coat wanders unobstructed backstage and onstage making foreboding comments like, "Do you believe in the fullness of time?"  Bottom line, it just didn't hold my interest, by the end I really didn't care what the ending was to portend.<br /><br />This film boasts some well known personalities in the cast such as Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Woody Harrelson and Lindsay Lohan, but lesser known Garrison Keiller steals the show. Unfortunately `A Praire Home Companion' makes for a much better concert than film.</p></body></html>

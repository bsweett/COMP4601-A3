I don't think Steven Spielberg wants us to dislike or hate the thief and that, we want justice to be done towards the end by having the cop getting the culprit.  Rather, he shares with us Leonardo's character's family background, about his parent's divorce, about a young innocent boy that is forced to grow up too fast to fend for himself.  All along, Leonardo's character has a affectionate relationships with his father (played convincingly by the ever brilliant Christopher Walken) &amp; there is a tell-tale sign in the movie that his X-factor is passed on by his father.  Maybe, Leonardo's character enjoys acting different characters so that he can escape from reality &amp; that, he wants to make a lot of money to justify to his parents that they don't need to worry about financial security anymore &amp; that they needn't have to worry about the very thing that separates them at the first place.  That's why in the end, all we have for Leonardo's character is utmost sympathy.  Sympathy is what Tom Hank's character gives Leonardo's character &amp; maybe, that's why they share this chemistry or bond that can be read in between the lines.  It's refreshing to see Martin Sheen NOT playing US President for a change.  A truly enjoyable movie to watch &amp; an affirmation of Steven Spielberg's versatility in directing different genres of movies.  Highly recommended &amp; shouldn't be missed!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better, but still a long, long way from being a home run."></head><body><p>The flaws of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; never bothered me that much upon its release, but this new version, while better, still is a long way from greatness.<p>The revised special effects are an improvement over some of the flawed originals (particularly the final scenes involving the walk to V'ger), and director Robert Wise has trimmed a lot of the unnecessary dialogue, but the main problem with this film was a script that packed too little excitement.<p>Unfortunately, that can't be cured with better visual effects or more effective film edits. This film was always a visual treat, but the characters and script let it down badly, and they still do.<p>Still, this film IS a good time, especially for Trekkies, and simply watching it in widescreen, on DVD, makes the film look and feel a whole lot better. Paramount also included some terrific bonus materials on the making of the film, and the aborted Star Trek TV series that became the film series.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A well made film that has a lot of galls."></head><body><p>I have seen this film to many times to count and I am yet to become even remotely sick of it. The acting is flawless, story flows at a great pace from the hours it generates on the screen. Fans of Scorsese, DeNiro, and Pesci should already know what this film consist of. The leading actors mention above, are all at their usual greatness, but the pleasant surprise from this movie is the electrifying performance by Sharon Stone, (who won a Golden Globe award and got an Oscar nomination for her role) as the con-artist trophy wife. She was truly memorable in this film because she effortlessly convinces us that she was one crazy "individual" that you love to hate.<br /><br />`Casino' (1995) takes a look at the upper level mafia as `Goodfellas' (1990) looked into the lives of low to mid level hoods. Robert De Niro again does a great performance, as Sam, who is at odds between being loyal to his bosses and retaining some kind of intregity.<br /><br /> Pesci, as Joe, is one remarkable actor. This man is only 5' 6'' but can be so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. "You want me to get out of my own town?! Don't *bleep* with me, Ace!" Does he swear throughout the entire film? Oh, yeah infamously. About 400+ f-words. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history. Joe did his thing being the [...] who thinks with his gun and not with his head. James Woods, Kevin Pollack, Alan King, Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, L.Q. Jones, and Dick Smothers all have done an excellent job with their supporting roles. The whole production of the film held up really well. The camera moves as if it has a life of its own and almost every scene is set nicely with its score plus the dialogue and narration are up to par.<br /><br />Like in other Scorsese films, the violence here is sudden and comes out to you unexpectedly. Countless of other reviewers, complained about the level of violence - suggesting an NC-17 rating would have been more appropriate. Whether you will like "Casino" or not depends entirely on your tolerance for character-driven films - and, of course, heavy violence, other then that `Casino' is another great and wild piece of cinema.</p></body></html>

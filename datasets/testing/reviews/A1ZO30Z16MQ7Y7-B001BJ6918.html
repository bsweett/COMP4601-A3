<meta name="summary" content="Bad."></head><body><p>I liked the first Kill Bill, but this one went nowere and was so stuip. Infact I was laughing the intire time. The worst part is were Uma Thurman is tied up and buried 5 miles under ground. So how she is able to get her feet untided, get a knife, untie her arms, punch her way out of the cofin she was in, and just climb up the 5 miles of dirt. This was the first summer film I have seen and it was bad. I hope Van Helsing, Alien vs. Predator, and Resident Evil 2 are better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DEVIL IN THE FLESH!!"></head><body><p>this movie is wicked creepy. i loved it, it paved the way for all these other excorsism movies, but this one is definitly the best. the actors were great, the story was so believable, the makeup was good, and it was truly scary. not much can do that these days, but this one still can. a young innocent girls bodies possessed, killing her off slowly, making her do all these horrible things to herself. the mother helpless what does she do. her last resource the church. the priests who give their lives to help. the oldest battle in the book: good against evil. they must do all they can to save this little girl. all the while being taunted and lured by this demonic creature. excellent story and brilliant idea. from start to finish this movie was great. don't mess with things you don't understand. the head twisting scene: WICKED.</p></body></html>

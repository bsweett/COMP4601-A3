I thought it was sad that at that time and place that two people who love each other can't be together without people making it their business, which Ledger's character Ennis Del Mar was worried about. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) was the outgoing of the two. He didn't care, he was willing to take the chance. They both ended up getting married, Ennis was divorced later. His wife found out their secret early.<br /><br />It's kind of a sad story and I felt for both of them but it was Ennis who my heart went out to. It's a worthwhile movie to see if you are open minded and willing to set through a fairly long movie that tells it's story slowly.</p></body></html>

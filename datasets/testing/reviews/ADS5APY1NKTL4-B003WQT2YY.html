It was a career-making vehicle for F. Murray Abraham, who went on to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in his role as the sadistic and insane Antonio Salieri, a jealous rival of the late, great Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce).  This film is part fantasy (a fictionalized account of the life and untimely death of the title composer, through the eyes of the elderly Salieri, who has been confined to insane asylum (or maybe the better word is "imprisoned," from his perspective), part musical tribute to some of the most well-known and beautifully written Mozart compositions.<br /><br />I won't go into too much detail about the plot.  That would easily ruin this film for you.  I will say that the acting is great, the music is gorgeous, there are moments of great humor, followed by high drama and the whole plot concept of this film is not so much crafted to romanticize Mozart as a man and an artist (far from it).  Instead, it examines the forces behind evil, jealousy and (ultimately) deception.  This is a very distinctive, evocative and compelling work of art.  I only hope that they re-release it in the movie theaters again.  You can't really experience it in its full glory (in my opinion) unless you have seen it on the big screen.</p></body></html>

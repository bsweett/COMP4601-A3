<meta name="summary" content=""I'LL BE BACK" GREAT SCI-FI THRILLER SPECIAL EDITION REVIEW!"></head><body><p>The Terminator is an impressive faced paced sci-fi/action film that had a pretty small budget, but the enthusiasm of first time director Cameron and the cast elevated this film far above and beyond it's hokey sci-fi origins. If you are not familiar with this film by now......what are you waiting for? This special edition released in 2001 has a nice DVD transfer and some very interesting extras included deleted scenes and commentary, a couple of feature-ettes(one a few years after the films released and one many years later). There are some cool trailers and TV spots, plus a copy of the original script. After watching the extras I had a new appreciation for the film and realized just how far enthusiasm can take a project. Arnold may not be a great actor(especially at this time), but his presence is certainly a big part of what makes this unstoppable cyborg work so well for this film. Hamilton turns in a very good performance as Sarah Conner and also adds depth to this heart pumping thriller!</p></body></html>

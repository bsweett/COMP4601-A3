If you watch this movie for fun, you will have a blast.  <p>The opening scene, with The Rock attempting to collect a little "past due" cash from a gambling football player, was excellent.  The Rock did an awesome job portraying a man about to get into some serious "toe-to-toe" knock-a-round.  For anyone who has been in a real bar fight, this scene was right on the money.<p>The Rock is excellent in this movie, and I finally have a new Steven Seagal to watch - seeing how all of Seagal's recent stuff sucks.<p>Seann William Scott did an excellent job in this movie, too.  Christopher Walken plays himself, as usual.  But all and all, this movie is what a good action movie should be.  I think The Rock has a great movie career going.  <p>Rundown is a definite hit.  I suggest you push that "buy" button and enjoy!<p>That's all I have to say about that...<p></p></body></html>

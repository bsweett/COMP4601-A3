<meta name="summary" content="Watching the latest sequel for Depp is a no-brainer."></head><body><p>Can't say I miss any of the absent original cast members... Johnny Depp is so perfect as Capt. Jack Sparrow you likely won't notice either. Although Geoffrey Rush returns as Capt. Barbossa as well as Sparrow's first-mate. This time Jack is searching for the Fountain of youth. Ian McShane (of Deadwood is electric as BlackBeard. Penelope Cruz is mostly forgettable , the mermaids may have the uppper hand for on screen female presence. I certainly enjoyed it more than the last movie of the film series. The ending is painfully predictable, but it made infinitely more sence than the last two... Although clearly every pirate in the Disney Universe is packing magic and zombies.. I can't wait to see how they supe-up Long John Silver in Pirates V.</p></body></html>

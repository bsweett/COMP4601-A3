<meta name="summary" content="Travolta: More Than a Woman"></head><body><p>When a movie begins with a teenage girl singing her way down the street on her way to school, greeting passersby with a smile and a wave, and the sun seems to shine directly on her beaming personality, one feels as if he's watching a vintage musical made by the Arthur Freed unit at the M-G-M of the 1940's.  But "Hairspray" is also a musical with a social conscience, satirical references, and a leading lady who is actually a man.  If such a concept had been pitched to L. B. Mayer during the Golden Age of the Hollywood musical, he would have called the mental ward demanding that men with nets be sent over to whisk the pitcher away.<br /> "Hairspray" is a film with enormous spirit, brimming with  enthusiasm, laced with great, funny moments, and with a political/social message at its core.  Yes, in a musical.<br /> Set in 1962 Baltimore, the film focuses on Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a plus-size teenager who counts the endless minutes until school is out for the day and she can rush home to watch and dance along with "The Corny Collins Show," a local afternoon rock `n' roll dance program in the "American Bandstand" mold.  Tracy and her pal Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) shake it up in front of the TV, getting excited about the new moves they see performed on the show.<br /> With her attention reserved for this iconic TV program, Tracy daydreams in class and is finally sent to detention, where she sees the black kids dancing in ways she's never seen before.  Seaweed (Elijah Kelley) welcomes her and shows her some snappy moves.<br /> The film eventually settles into its main plot:  Tracy becomes an unstoppable force in integrating "The Corny Collins Show," so that the white kids and the black kids can dance together.  In the Baltimore of 1962, this isn't easy.  Her biggest obstacle is the owner of the TV station, former beauty pageant queen Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), a Dragon Lady control freak who makes sure her own daughter, Amber (Brittany Snow), a dancer on the show, gets most of the camera time.<br /> "Hairspray" is filled with full-throttle performances by James Marsden (Corny Collins), Zac Efron of "High School Musical" fame (Link Larkin, the TV show's heartthrob), Allison Janney (prune-faced Prudy Pingleton, Amber's mom), Jerry Stiller (Mr. Pinky, owner of a clothing store for large women), and dancing spitfire Little Inez (Taylor Parks).<br /> The film also benefits greatly from the presence of Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelle, Seaweed and Inez's mom and the owner of a local record shop.  Queen Latifah brings her expansive charm to a role that calls for Maybelle to brook indignities in order to get a foothold for herself and for blacks in general in a still-segregated era.  That she retains her dignity and comes off as more morally grounded than those in charge makes Maybelle the poster girl for a society in the throes of sweeping social change.  When she sings, the melodies are hot, the lyrics cutting.<br />  Despite this abundance of on-screen talent, the character that steals the show is Tracy's mom, Edna, played by John Travolta in fat suit and house dress, pancake make-up and wig.  Traditionally, this role has been played by a man -- Divine in the original John Waters film, Harvey Fierstein on Broadway, and now Travolta.  Make no mistake, though.  This is no mere one-note drag act.<br /> Edna is a laundress who works at home.  Her ambitions are modest, her self-image sad.  She loves Tracy, but like her fellow Balimore-ites, she holds traditional values and doesn't want to upset the apple cart of society.  It takes Tracy's dedication to her cause and her outrage at inequality for Edna to come out of her shell.  Watching Travolta, you soon accept him totally as Edna.  He's funny, but not merely a caricature.  Edna's a real woman we come to like immensely, both for her imperfections and for her ultimate willingness to open a closed mind to new ideas.<br /> When Tracy persuades Edna to leave the house for the first time in years, Edna blossoms as she buys a new wardrobe, has her hair done, and dances through the streets in "Welcome to the 60's."  This number is absolutely wonderful, suggesting the euphoria of Gene Kelly's dance in the rain and Astaire's tapping on walls and ceiling.  Travolta moves all of that padding with grace, giving Edna elegance.  Her physical emergence from moth to butterfly is also the beginning of her social awakening.<br /> Christopher Walken plays Tracy's dad, Wilbur, owner of a gags and jokes shop.  The one number he performs -- a duet with Travolta, "(You're) Timeless to Me," is disappointing.  Walken can dance.  If you don't believe me, check out his amazing solo in "Pennies From Heaven."  Here, though, he looks awkward as he tries to negotiate Edna's wide girth.  On Broadway, the number was a showstopper -- a vaudevillian soft shoe amid the frenetic rock `n' roll tempos.  In the film, the number falls flat, even though Travolta does his best to sell the solid bond between Edna and Wilbur.<br /> Director/choreographer Adam Shankman has moved the film along briskly and staged exciting dance sequences.  His choreography showcases the dancers' expertise as it channels 60's rock `n' roll dance moves and simultaneously incorporating snappy Broadway pizzazz.<br /> Rated PG, "Hairspray" will put a  broad smile on your face.</p></body></html>

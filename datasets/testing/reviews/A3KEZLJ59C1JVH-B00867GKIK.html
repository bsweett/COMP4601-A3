<meta name="summary" content="Another brilliant installment from Pixar"></head><body><p>"Up" tells the story of Carl, an elderly man who recently lost his beloved wife, Ellie, and is determined to abide by a promise he made her long ago to take their house to the top of South America's beautiful Paradise Falls. A retired balloon seller, Carl devises a plan to lift his home off its foundation and fly to the Falls using thousands of helium balloons. Once his journey begins, Carl is shocked to discover that he has a stowaway on board: Russell, a neighborhood Wilderness Explorer Scout who's desperate to earn his Elderly Assistance Badge by helping Carl. Over the course of their adventure, Carl and Russell encounter a gang of talking dogs, a giant exotic bird, and a dangerous explorer who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Carl ultimately discovers that he still has a whole lot of living to do.<br /><br />I love that Pixar is brave enough to roll with such ingenious ideas that go completely against the norm when it comes to making children's films. "Up" is a great story that will touch the hearts of kids and adults alike. In fact, the first 10 minutes of the movie are so incredibly touching and heartbreaking that they left me, a 30-year-old woman, literally in tears. I don't think any other animated film has ever affected me so much. "Up" is fantastic. See it ASAP.</p></body></html>

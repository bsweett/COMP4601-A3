<meta name="summary" content="A film that may not have an audience"></head><body><p>As a staunch liberal, I was a little nervous about going to see "Team America" when I heard from some critics that it had a right-wing bias (that shocked me when I first heard it, considering the title of the movie).  However, since I loved "South Park", I decided to try and watch the movie with an open mind and, most importantly, try not to take anything seriously.  What I saw was an original, marginally offensive, and occasionally amusing comedy that was unfortunately well below the level of the "South Park" movie.<br /><br />"Team America"'s best laughs come in the first couple minutes, when we see the puppets in action for the first time.  The Middle Eastern stereotypes are hilarious, as is the "patriotic" background music as Team America battles the terrorists.  In fact, the songs throughout the film are good.  There's an absolutely hilarious puppet sex scene, and the Kim Jong puppet is consistently funny (he resembles Cartman).  Most surprisingly, "Team America" works somewhat as a straight-ahead action picture, since it never takes itself seriously and has plenty of puppet-filled action.<br /><br />However, I had qualms with the movie, and mostly with its satire.  The first time the movie made fun of the liberal Hollywood activists, it was funny, but to my disappointment this became a major plot point (by the end, the Hollywood liberals are basically in league with the terrorists).  I consider myself a good sport- I chuckled when puppet Michael Moore decided to suicide-bomb the Team America center- but the idea of Hollywood liberals actively working against the country is a joke that wears thin fast (exempting puppet Matt Damon, who is consistently funny).  Also, the film really bogs down in its final half hour; by that point, the novelty of the puppets had worn off, and more jokes were falling flat (although there is a funny speech at the end).<br /><br />I myself had mixed feelings about "Team America".  It's funny, but not nearly enough.  I'm not sure what the audience for the film could be.  Conservatives will find it too raunchy, liberals will be downright offended, comedy fans may not find it funny enough, and action fans won't like how little it takes itself seriously.  I guess I could recommend it to curious "South Park" fans, but I think overall "Team America" is more deservant of a rental than a movie ticket price.</p></body></html>

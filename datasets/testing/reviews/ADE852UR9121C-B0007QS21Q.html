In this futuristic (yawn) movie, Det. Spooner is investigating the death of a roboticist, Dr. Lanning. He finds a protocol NS-5 robot, Sonny in the doctor's room and being the robo-hater that he is...immediately blames Sonny for the murder. Of course, Sonny being the cool, kick-ass robot that HE is, escapes. Spooner, with the help of robot psychologist Susan have to track down Sonny and get to the root of the "who-dunnit" mystery. Oh yeah, robots in the future are programmed with these 3 laws:<br /><br />1) They can't hurt humans.<br /><br />2) They have to follow whatever the hell the human tells them unless it conflicts with Rule 1.<br /><br />3) Robots will do anything to protect themselves unless it conflicts with Rule 1.<br /><br />So, there lies the problem. How could the NS-5 unit have killed Dr. Lanning.<br /><br />I have to say, although I LOVE sci-fi movies...it's a tricky genre to tackle. Overdoing it, and it becomes silly. Not doing enough would make it bland. Plus it has to be original. In I, Robot...I felt like I was watching a mixture of other sci-fi movies particularly Minority Report (which I totally DUG, and have watched it about 10 times). And the sad thing was, the concept behind this movie was pretty interesting (credit to Asimov for that) but of course as soon as they Hollywood-ized it, the movie falls apart. The story is SO typical, it offers nothing new. Det. Spooner is the rogue detective, the "thinking out of the box-crazy type" that 10 minutes into the movie, you know that in the end he's gonna be right, and he's gonna go back to his captain (or whatever) and say "a-ha, in your face". While the robot, Sonny was definitely interesting, it didn't really lead to anything groundbreaking. Apart from that, we have the reluctant but noble heroin, the guy who's trying so hard to be bad that you know he's not the culprit, and a whole lotta unoriginal stuff. To me, this is why the movie failed. As I said, it had an interesting premise but it just doesn't get explored in the way I would've liked it to.<br /><br />The acting is so-so. Will Smith is really starting to irritate me. After his fantastic performances in movies like Independance Day, Enemy Of The State and Men In Black (1, not 2), now he just seems content to look buff and deliver lame lines. More than once, I felt like punching the heck out of him. I know, he didn't have much to work on anyway, thanks to such a dry script, but I still felt he was really miscast here. Bridget Moynahan delivers a mediocre performance, there seemed to be no chemistry whatsoever between her and Spooner, she looked like she was acting with a gun to her head. The rest of the cast do an alright job, probably because they've seen the same thing in a hundred other movies.<br /><br />The saving grace for this movie has got to be the visual effects. There were many scenes with the robots that literally took my breath away. It's amazing how far CG has advanced in movies. Everytime Sonny appears on screen, he steals the limelight. His moves and facial expressions outperforms the humans anytime. Even when he speaks, his voice seem to reflect his emotions, which caused the hoo-ha because robots are not supposed to have emotions. I thought this was done very well, and to be honest kept me watching until the end.<br /><br />In short, save your money...watch this on cable or rent the DVD coz it's really not worth getting. The storyline leaves much to be desired. The acting is less than satisfactory. You're much better off watching sci-fi greats like The Matrix or Blade Runner. Now, if you'll excuse me...I'm gonna watch Minority Report for the 11th time.</p></body></html>

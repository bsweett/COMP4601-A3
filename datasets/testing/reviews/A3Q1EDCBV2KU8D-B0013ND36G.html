The storyline suffered until the second half of the movie when the Terminator starts filling in the pieces on what's going on and why.  Then there is a bit of a surprise at the end that in hind-sight fits the movie.  Overall, get the movie because of the effects, not because of a storyline, this way you won't be disappointed when a minor one shows up.</p></body></html>

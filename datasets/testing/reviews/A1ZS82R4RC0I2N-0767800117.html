<meta name="summary" content="Not That Glorious"></head><body><p>This decent but far from excellent drama has a couple of good moments and manages to give some insight into the American Civil War, still it`s way too overrated and glorified. Director Edward Zwick wants to praise the black soldiers` stenght and relevant contribution, yet unfortunately his perspective is too similar to that of an average, altough well-intended, TV-movie. Sure, there are plenty of good performances here (Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, most of the cast is fine, to be fair) and the settings are competent enough, but the movie drags in many moments, has too many patchy scenes and the annoying and awe-inspiring score doesn`t help. &quot;Glory&quot; is a relevant document, not quite a particularly strong and impressive cinematic experience. It`s overlong, predictable and more PC than it really needed to, delivering an ok but nothing special movie. Good to kill a couple of hours and even think a bit, but a masterpiece it is not. <p>Competently made and watchable enough.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Is too much action possible?"></head><body><p>This thing is very noisy and the action, after a slow opening, is almost non-stop car chases, crashes, explosions, building collapses etc etc. After awhile, it all begins to look the same. And sound the same. Also, at 2 hours and 10 minutes, this is about 40 minutes too long to tell its story, which is rather simple. There is nothing to justify the length, other than, perhaps, the director's reluctance to leave yet more noise on the cutting room floor. At least ScarJo is something to look at. But why is Djimon Hounsou always dripping, just dripping, with sweat dripping offf his bald head, while no one else is? Hmm?</p></body></html>

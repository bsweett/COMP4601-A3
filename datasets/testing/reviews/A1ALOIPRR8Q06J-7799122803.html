Why is that?<br /><br />The highlight for me was Johnny Depp yet again perfectly transformed and fully immersed in another character, except for the ultra-goofy "dance" which was maybe the worst, most cringe inducing thing in the whole movie. But what an actor! He even came up with the look of his Mad Hatter. Perfect.<br /><br />The biggest failure of this film -I'd agree with Roger Ebert- is the big, dumb, loud and boring unnecessary third act battle.<br /><br />But I found this movie in general just really *odd*. It's a story about an upper class English girl from stuffy aristocratic society, this time in her late teens, hanging out with a bunch of weirdos, as director Tim Burton put it. Well Burton said "brat" hanging with a bunch of weirdos is basically the depth to which the story has been brought to the screen before, but here Alice seems like a pretty cool, independently minded chick ahead of her time. In fact the Burton version is basically a "you-go-girl" fable about following your bliss (literally following your dreams in this case) and having the courage to be yourself...<br /><br />It felt familiar but wasn't what I expected at the same time and the story didn't truly hold my interest and exactly why I can't put my finger on. Combination of things. Burton's attempt to add a tad more depth to these dream creatures and this being Alice's second trip down the rabbit hole? The pacing of events and subplots? I don't recall the Disney cartoon so much or the original Lewis Carrol story at all but there were details in this version that were weird. Members of The Red Queen's court and the intrigues, the Knave of Hearts, just the look of some of these characters and the castle were creepy, but not in a good way to me. This movie will give many kids some weird dreams by the way.<br />The special effects were OK but for a person not too big on cgi I was again underwhelmed. Props on The Cheshire Cat tho... I dug that. To be sure there were some moments. I went in with an open mind towards the cgi and the 3-D and I gotta say I think 3-D is overall just lame. It strikes me as mostly a gimmick and the visuals will look more vibrant and colorful in good ole 2-dimension in your home on Blue Ray. (Although I want to add as a side note the preview for a 3-D documentary of the mission to repair to Hubble Telescope was incredible!!)<br /><br />Sorry don't want to harsh anybody's high.<br />2.8 stars</p></body></html>

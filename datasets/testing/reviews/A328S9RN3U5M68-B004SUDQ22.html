<meta name="summary" content="A Perfectly Integrated Film,  Played as a Fine String Quartet"></head><body><p>PROOF is one of those rare films that transfers a superb play directly to the screen without losing a bit of the power of the play, but enhancing the story with the advantages of the camera.  With a tough story like this one it takes a brilliant cast and director to fine-tune the work and in this instance it all works to perfection.<br /><br />The story is well known from all the PR of the theatrical screening: recounting it in a review does not  add or subtract the importance of the film or the experience of the viewer.  The premise, mathematician Robert (Anthony Hopkins) and his caretaker daughter Catherine (Gweneth Paltrow) who also is an uncommonly bright  27-year-old mathematics mind and has spent the glowing years of her youth caring for her recently deceased father. They converse in flashbacks, a means of realizing the closeness of their bond emotionally, mentally, and probably parallel mental illness proclivities.  Robert left notebooks filled with thoughts and clues to a complex mathematical proof and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a devoted admirer of Robert's genius, is organizing the thoughts and deciphering the meanings of Robert's scribblings. Catherine's estranged sister Claire (Hope Davis) arrives to 'settle' the matters left by Robert's demise and becomes the camera that brings focus to the fact that Catherine has inherited not only her father's genius but his mental fragility as well.  How this quartet - Robert, Catherine, Hal, Claire - serve to unravel the findings of Robert's (and Catherine's) legacy is the essence of this gripping tale.<br /><br />A more powerful group of actors for this film would be difficult to find.  One expects the brilliance of Paltrow's performance since she had time with the character on the stage, and Hopkins can toss these bizarre characters off with grace and aplomb.  But it is the pleasure of seeing Davis and Gyllenhaal rise to the same level of expertise that makes the film glow.  This is an example of ensemble acting of the highest form and director Madden conducts the performance with sensitivity and momentum.  The result is a treasureable, intelligent, powerful film that challenges the mind while entertaining all the senses.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, February 06</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of my top 3 movies of all time!"></head><body><p>I am so shocked that this movie even received one bad review. One. Some of these reviews here say that the movie is boring, too complicated and not scary. When you see Danny riding his little troller, how aren't you hooked. When the naked girl "transforms", admit that you jumped out of your seat.<br /><br />This movie also isn't complicated, you just need to pay attention.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is one of the most creative that I've ever seen. It is said to be unfaithful to the Stephen King book. I never read it and mr. King must be a pretty cocky guy if he thinks that he can remake this movie and top it.<br /><br />This movie is perfect. No, I'm not kidding, it's perfect. Only this movie, Mulholland Drive and Psycho stand as perfect movies in my opinion. What I mean is that none of these movies have any flaws. They are 100% perfect.<br /><br />Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a writer, takes a job to watch over and maintain a hotel complex up in the mountains in Denver. He goes there with his wife Wendy and son Danny.<br /><br />At firs, he seems to be the perfect fit for the job but that's before he becomes mad.<br /><br />Danny has the shining, an ability to see dead people and horrifiying images. He can also maintain conversations without opening his mouth. Danny Lloyd the actor who played him gives a performance that left me speechless.<br /><br />Jack is also seeing crazy stuff, talking to a guy who used to care over the place who went really crazy.<br /><br />The movie shows Jack on the brink of insanity. This movie shows the fear encountered towards a memeber of your family. And that is trully a terrifying thing.<br /><br />The score is brillinat, going along with the pace of the movie.<br /><br />The cinematography is my favorite part of the movie. It is the best of all time. It follows Danny on his troller from behind so you don't know what's around the corner. And that definitely builds up the chills.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful. Jack Nicholson gives his best performance and one of the best of all time. He is terrifying and has so many great lines. Just look at his movements, his tone of voice, his eyes, his grimaces, he is a creepy guy. His perfromance is chilling.<br /><br />Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd also give very good performances notably Lloyd.<br /><br />The Shining is an absolutely horrifying movie, and is one of the few movies that scare me. And I don't get scared easily.<br /><br />See it now.</p></body></html>

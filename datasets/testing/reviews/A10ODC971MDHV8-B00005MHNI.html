<meta name="summary" content="A Clockwork Orange"></head><body><p>Based on the Anthony Burgess novel, Kubrick's cold, pitch-black satire of modern society received an X rating for violence and was yanked from screens by the rattled director after several copycat crimes. Nevertheless, his chilly vision of a morally ambiguous future world picked up Oscar nods for Best Picture and Director. Outfitted in a bowler hat, white jumpsuit, and codpiece, McDowell gives an iconic performance as Alex, a gleeful connoisseur of brutality who enjoys warbling "Singin' in the Rain" while committing vile acts. A cynical but stylish sci-fi cult hit, "Orange" is a disturbing yet intriguing film in a class all its own.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>I was afraid that "The Forgotten" was going to be just like all the other crappy thriller/horror movies that have been released over the past few years, but this film was pretty interesting and the ending was not at all craptastic.<br /><br />Basically, the movie opens by introducing Telly (Julianne Moore) as a grieving mother whose nine-year-old son supposedly died in a plane crash 14 months ago. In a very "X-Files" sort of way, Telly is stunned when her husband Jim (Anthony Edwards) suddenly tried to convince her that their son never existed. Everyone is under the impression that Telly is delusional...no one else in town has any memory of her child. Telly finally meets up with her neighbor, Ash (Dominic West), whose daughter was also aboard the plane that crashed. At first Ash has no memory of the children and is convinced that Telly is crazy, but she finally helps him trigger memories of his daughter. The two parents embark on a desperate and dangerous search in order to determine the truth behind what happened to their children and ultimately discover who (actually, more like WHAT) is behind the mystery.<br /><br />I think it would have been interesting to include a better explanation of why the "experiment" occurred in the first place. (I'd go into more detail, but I really don't want to spoil the plot for anyone!) I also would have appreciated having a better understanding of what Gary Sinese's character was up to at the end of the film and what the hell happened to Jim (is he still wandering around dazed and confused somewhere?). The movie doesn't go into great detail about HOW all these crazy things are happening and what exactly the "creepy people" (including Linus Roache's character) are supposed to be. That didn't bother me too much, but some people might not appreciate it. I was just happy that there were plenty of shocking moments in the film (I think I lost five years off my life when that car hit Telly's passenger door...that made me scream!) and that the ending was not stupid or predictable.<br /><br />"The Forgotten" is not a great movie, but it's a pretty good one...definitely worth checking out.</p></body></html>

Although he purposely applied many layers both technologically and psychologically, the actual finished product is deeper and has many more facets. This could be the results of leaving loose ends and just implications. What looks like two stories is really one story where one reality intertwines with another reality until they both merge.<br /><br />It is 1944 Spain, five years after the Civil War, ten year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going to meet her new stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez.) Vidal is a fascist pro-Franco officer. She is about to meet more than that as she encounters possible friends from another world. We also see how touchier and fantasy are juxtaposed. One of the major questions to answer is, is the magical creatures real and can only be seen because you have to have the right gaze or are they figments?<br /><br />You will need to watch the movie several times to get the nuances and see the surrounding environments that you miss when concentrating on the dialog. See how the two world parallels in furniture. See out the two works hold similar tasks as both containing a key and a knife. In addition, there are always more surprises waiting.<br /><br />The acting is superb especially Ofelia's death scene. Ivana Baquero Won, Imagen Award Best Actress, Premio ACE Best New Actress, Newcomer Award Female (Categor&iacute;a Femenina), Turia Award New Best Actress, and Nominated, Young Artist Award Best Performance in an International Feature Film - Leading Young Actor or Actress.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version I watched had English subtitles as option but I found them to be a tad inaccurate and wanting of some of the background conversations. However, the director's voice over option helped point out the obvious that was not obvious until he pointed it out. As pointed out by the director, the violence was not for violence sake in the story and they did not have cowboy type breakable props.<br /><br />This is one of the films that take good advantage of Blu-ray resolution and intensity.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P6R5Y8">Bridge to Terabithia [Blu-ray</a>]<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780658418">Pan's Labyrinth</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001URA5XY">Phoebe in Wonderland</a></p></body></html>

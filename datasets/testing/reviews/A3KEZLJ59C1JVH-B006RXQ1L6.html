It stuck exactly to the script of the original Broadway show and captured the essence of Fosse's original choreography. I was blown away. I already knew that Catherine Zeta-Jones could sing, and of course she impressed me (as always), but I was stunned by Renee Zellweger's outstanding performance, as well as Richard Gere's. They were all fabulous: even Queen Latifah was good (now there's something I thought I'd never say!). <p>It was an amazing film that really captured the &quot;razzle dazzle&quot; of the stage show, very brassy and daring and energetic. I loved it. Everyone needs to see it. I'm glad that &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; started a trend and that the movie musical is making a major comeback.</p></body></html>

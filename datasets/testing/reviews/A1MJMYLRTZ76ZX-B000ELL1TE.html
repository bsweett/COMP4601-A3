Brad Pitt still spends the entire movie talking like he's got a tampon stuffed in each cheek (sort of like the cotton wads Marlon Brando used in The Godfather). Is this the way these people really talk? And I thought I had a speech impediment. I should start auditioning for parts in movies about Irish gypsies. Still, this was a pretty good flick and I'd actually give it 4.5 stars if I could. Big Bubba says go see it and don't Bogart the popcorn.</p></body></html>

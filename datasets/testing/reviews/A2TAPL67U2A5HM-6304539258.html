Knowing the background story explains a lot of things that made little to no sense before. For example, why r2-d2 and c3po are always together, the nature of Darth Vader, why Obi-one Kenobi is Lukes jedi master and many many other questions that one had whilst watching this movie before. The special effects are a bit primitive but for the time they were outstanding and some of the best in the business. The music is right on the money. The script is very well written and the plot is filled with action and and exciting adventure. If one does have to say something negative then it is to the fact that Mark Hamill  is a terrible actor and just about anyone could have played that part better. Even so this is a great movie and I give it 5 well deserved stars.</p></body></html>

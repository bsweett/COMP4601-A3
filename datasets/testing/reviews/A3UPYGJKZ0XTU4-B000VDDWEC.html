<meta name="summary" content="A Little Horror, a Little Philosophy, and A Lot of Blood."></head><body><p>A group of animal rights activists unleash a deadly virus when they attempt to free infected chimpanzees from a primate research facility. 28 days later, Jimmy (Cillian Murphy) awakes in his hospital bed to find himself alone. The entire city of London seems at first to be deserted. Unfortunately, it hasn't been entirely abandoned: most of the remaining population are infected humans whom the virus has transformed into homicidal maniacs in a constant state of rage. Jimmy encounters a few remaining sane individuals: Selena (Naomie Harris), a fiercely independent woman who won't hesitate to do anything that might enable her to survive, and Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns), whose close relationship has given them a less cynical outlook. Together they set out to find the source of a continual radio broadcast, hoping they will find safety and other uninfected humans. But as the saying goes, you should be careful what you wish for.<p>&quot;28 Days Later&quot; is not so much a horror movie in the traditional sense as it is a gruesome philosophical drama. There is a lot of slaughter and a great deal of blood. There is only one scene that I found disturbingly violent, but the film is grisly enough to merit a warning that  sensitive persons should avoid it. Blood and guts don't actually seem to be the point of the film, though. It's about the rage that dwells within human beings, and it's a philosophical treatise on the nature of violence. Balancing the obligations of a horror film with those of a broad social commentary is challenging, and I don't think that &quot;28 Days Later&quot; quite succeeds. I found the philosophical aspect of the film to be ridiculously simplistic. And I don't think that it creates enough suspense to be a great horror film. &quot;28 Days Later&quot; was shot on digital video to conserve time and money, and it looks it. It's ugly, but that's suitable to the gritty environments in which the story takes place. In conclusion, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; gives the audience a little horror, a little philosophy, and a lot of blood. It isn't bad, but there isn't enough to recommend it either.<p>The DVD: You can choose English or Spanish subtitles. Bonus features include: deleted scenes; a &quot;making of&quot; documentary featuring interviews with the cast, director Danny Boyle, and some paranoid talk about pandemics; a gallery of still photographs, with commentary, taken by the film's still photographer, many of which are quite good; a gallery of Polaroids taken during production for continuity purposes; theatrical trailers; animated storyboards from the film's UK website; and a music video. I recommend the still photograph gallery.</p></body></html>

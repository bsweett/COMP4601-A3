Sure, there are moments when the movie is a tad on the creepy side, but for the most part it is a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together in a tired fashion that comes across corny and out of place as apposed to genuinely scary and frightening.  I had truly no desire to see this movie.  Sadly Robert De Niro has fallen away from everything that made him great and so upon seeing the trailer for this movie I immediately made the connection to the debacle known as `Godsend' and figured that this would be the same kind of mess.  In actuality though, I think that this was even worse.  At lease `Godsend' has a somewhat original plot.<br /><br />`Hide and Seek' follows David Callaway and his troubled daughter Emily as they travel to upstate New York shortly after David's wife Alison commits suicide.  The tragedy has had a terrible effect on Emily who is cold and distant and destructive.  Soon after moving Emily makes a new friend, Charlie, and it's shortly after this that things get weird.  Emily's demeanor gets worse and worse and things start happening around the house that suggest something sinister in the works.<br /><br />What irritates me the most about `Hide and Seek' is that it doesn't know when to quit.  It wants so badly to keep one guessing that it veers off on what promises to be eerie subplots only to abandon them with questions left lingering and take us in a completely different direction.  One wonders in the end just what Laura was talking about when she said that she's "said too much" or just what Emily said to Sheriff Hafferty or maybe even more so, what in the world Sheriff Hafferty was getting at when he was questioning Emily.  These loose ends and plenty others regarding Charlie especially beg to be answered but the sloppy script leaves them all unanswered.<br /><br />I think it's safe to say that the four main stars in this film are far better than this.  Robert De Niro was at one time our greatest working actor.  Iconic performances like that of Vito Corleone or Travis Bickle will go down in history as some of the best the world has ever seen; so why is he starring in this tripe.  Elisabeth Shue, while not my favorite actress, has proven to be above this, and Famke Janssen (easily the best thing about this movie) needs to further explore the brilliance she brought to the second season of `Nip Tuck'.  Dakota Fanning is decent here, not as stiff or mechanical as De Niro, yet she overdoes it quite a bit.  I prefer her to play the sweet mature child (see `I Am Sam' or `War of the Worlds') to the eerie gothic girl.  She comes off as trying too hard.<br /><br />In the end I would stay far, far away from this film.  It isn't even a decent B-Grade horror film.  The chills are short lived, and in the end when Charlie is revealed you'll be let down at the fact that you guessed it way too soon in the game.</p></body></html>

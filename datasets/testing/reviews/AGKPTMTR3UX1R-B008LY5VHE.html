<meta name="summary" content=""Mr. Hooper, that's the USS INDIANAPOLIS.""></head><body><p>With JAWS, Steven Spielberg burst upon the Hollywood scene, coincidentally inventing the summer blockbuster (for a while it was the highest-grossing film in history, breaking the $100 million mark), and laying the predicate for a whole series of wildly successful science fiction/adventure films that dominated the late 1970s and early 1980s, films like the STAR WARS trilogy, the STAR TREK series, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, E.T., RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and its sequels, a slew of uneven remakes of 1950s classics, and a host of less-than-memorable gadget-monster knock-offs.<br /><br />Lest you wonder, JAWS is sci-fi: A trio of intrepid explorers/monster hunters (Quint, Hooper and the Chief) travel to an alien world (the ocean) to take on a supernormal sentient beast (the shark) which has been threatening Earth (in this case, the fictional Amity Island).<br /><br />Just as trivia: JAWS the novel takes place on the South Shore of Long Island in a town called Amity; this brought notoriety to the real South Shore town of Amityville, notoriety which was confirmed with THE AMITYVILLE HORROR a few years later.<br /><br />Luckily for Spielberg, JAWS was and still is a wonderful entertainment experience, belieing its history of horrendous cost overruns and production problems, a history which would have sunk Spielberg's career before it ever started, had JAWS been less successful.<br /><br />We never get to see the shark until the third reel; however, John Williams' classic "Da-dum da-dum da-dum" theme is familiar enough a part of popular culture to make swimmers look around nervously 'til today. It's a character in itself.<br /><br />Robert Shaw turns in a masterful performance as Quint, the salty, snarly, obscene Ancient Mariner come to life. Richard Dreyfus plays Matt Hooper, a college-boy ichyologist caught up in a hilarious contest of machismo with the barnacled Quint, in which the two crush beer cans (Quint) and styrofoam cups (Hooper), trade barbs (literally and figuratively) as the hunt goes on, and eventually bond in their shared Ahabian quest against the shark. The Buddy Film quality of JAWS is immortal.<br /><br />Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody, the seafearing New York cop who always wants a bigger boat. Every sailor knows the scat dialogue, "Get away from that radio!" never actually shouted by Quint as he smashes his marine radio to bits after the nervous, completely-out-of-his-element Brody calls mayday after just seeing the shark for the first time.<br /><br />Murray Hamilton turns in the best performance of his career as the gregarious, disbelieving Mayor Larry Vaughan, who refuses to accept that his town has become a seafood buffet, albeit from the wet side of the tide line. His doubt nearly consumes him. It DOES consume several of his constituents.<br /><br />Quite possibly one of the ten best films of all time, JAWS entertains immensely even a third of a century later.</p></body></html>

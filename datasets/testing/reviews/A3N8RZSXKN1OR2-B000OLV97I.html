<meta name="summary" content="The start of something big"></head><body><p>Watching this well-done SFX feast, it's easy to guess at the major influences of Christopher Paolini: Anne McCaffrey's Pern series, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618640150">The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>.  In fact, "Eragon" might almost be described as "A New Hope" without spaceships--but that doesn't make it any the less enjoyable.  Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a 17-year-old farmboy who's been raised by his mother's brother (Alun Armstrong) following her precipitous and mysterious disappearance from his life.  His country groans under the tyrannical rule of Galbatorix (John Malkovich), the last of a corps of dragon riders who for thousands of years were the guardians of the land and its people until they fell to quarrelling among themselves and gave him a chance to destroy them from within.  Eragon knows he'll soon be of age to be impressed into the king's army--his cousin has already headed off into the wilderness rather than meet that fate--but before he can decide what to do about it, he finds a beautiful blue object from which hatches a small dragon.  The creature grows rapidly and soon is communicating mentally with him, explaining that he is her destined Rider.  But the King and his sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle) know the egg has hatched, and send assassins after its Rider.  Only with the help of Brom (Jeremy Irons), an antisocial villager with secrets of his own, do Eragon and his dragon Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz) escape.  Then there's the matter of a beautiful young woman (Sienna Guillory) being held prisoner by Durza and the King, a band of fugitive rebels hiding in the mountains, and the young archer (Garrett Hedlund) who saves Eragon's life.<br /><br />It becomes clear fairly early on that Eragon isn't a Rider because he has a dragon: he has a dragon because he's a Rider.  The ability to work magic is in him--he just needs it trained--and Saphira has somehow sensed this (a dragon will wait forever to hatch if it has to, rather than emerge without its Rider to bond to).  There's plenty of fast action, scary villains, great costumes and armor (especially Saphira's wonderfully articulated suit), and of course splendid special effects (created, of course, by George Lucas's ILM), plus a powerful soundtrack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NI3G2S">Soundtrack</a> by Patrick Doyle.  Nothing's been heard so far of further film adaptations of Paolini's trilogy; I hope they're in the works!</p></body></html>

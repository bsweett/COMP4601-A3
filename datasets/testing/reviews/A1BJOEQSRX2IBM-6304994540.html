<meta name="summary" content="Funny and Eccentric!"></head><body><p>It is widely known that the Coen Brothers made 'eccentricity' an art form. And this is just what this movie has to offer; eccentric characters, weird plot, funny dialogue and aimless situations that ultimately set the mood  for the picture. John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare and John  Turturro, all Coen regulars and all deliver great performances and draw  uniquely weird characters. Newcomers to the Coen zanniness, Julianne Moore  and Philip Seymour Hoffman are very promising actors and are also great in  their roles. But kudos go to Jeff Bridges and John Goodman who both give  excellent performances and are very funny together. Not as good as other  Coen films but very funny, weird and entertaining. From a scale of 1-10 I  give this film a 7!</p></body></html>

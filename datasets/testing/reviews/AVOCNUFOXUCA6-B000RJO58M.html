<meta name="summary" content="A classic comedy!"></head><body><p>"Hot Fuzz" is one of the funniest movies I've seen for a while.  Although it's British, you need not be a fan of British humor to love it; indeed, most of its comedy derives from making fun of quintessentially American cop movies - particularly, the fun but reality-challenged "Point Break" and "Bad Boyz II".  From the first minute, the script is packed full of comic gold.  There is no shortage of laughter from this movie!  In many ways, it's as if "Evil Dead II," "Dead Alive," "Shaun of the Dead," and every American cop movie were combined into some perfect mutant stepchild.<br /><br />In addition, "Hot Fuzz" is the most tightly-written and directed movie I've seen in years.  Literally every frame and every line in the first and second acts sets up, and is important to, the third act.  Not a single line could be cut without affecting the final act - something you can't say about virtually any other movie, unfortunately.  The movie is even better, and even funnier, for being written and directed with such economy.  And Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have never been funnier.<br /><br />If you liked "Shaun of the Dead," you will love "Hot Fuzz."  If you never saw "Shaun of the Dead," then trust me, you will still love "Hot Fuzz."  Rent it, borrow it, buy it; but watch it somewhere, somehow.  You will be glad you did.</p></body></html>

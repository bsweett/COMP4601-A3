<meta name="summary" content="Will he be back for a fourth?"></head><body><p>With rumours circulating about a fourth Terminator movie, featuring Arnie in a cameo-only role due to his high priority commitments as California govenor, this will probably ruin the whole trilogy for fans of the films. Arnie is the THE Terminator, if he doesn't come back in a decent role for the fourth, if it goes through (lets all hope it doesn't), I'll be mighty disappointed. Crackers without cheese is what Terminator would be without Arnie (oooh, cheese!)<br /><br />Michael Biehn (yum), and Linda Hamilton also feature alongside Arnie, trying to get rid of him. I actually prefer Linda Hamilton in the second one, the eighties hairstyle she has in this, is very bad. Very, very bad. Although she's a lot more masculine looking in the second, she looks loads better. I also prefer Arnie in the later movies than this one. He's so plastic/fake looking at one point, particularly the scene where he removes his eye, and dons the infamous shades. (One afternoon during a break in filming, Arnold Schwarzenegger went into a restaurant in downtown L.A. to get some lunch and realized all too late that he was still in Terminator makeup - with a missing eye, exposed jawbone and burned flesh.)<br /><br />Michael Biehn's character gets bitten on the hand by another character. This happens to him in every James Cameron movie he's in - see Aliens and The Abyss. The scene where the Terminator punches through a car's windshield was done with a hydraulic piston that was positioned next to Arnold Schwarzenegger, to look like his arm; they even had it pass through the arm on the jacket to give added realism. Auto glass is almost impossible to penetrate, by design, which required them to use hydraulics to get enough force. The idea stayed with Cameron and he used it again during the fight between the T-800 and T-1000 in T2: Terminator 2.<br /><br />To Arnie speaks very little in this movie is an understatement. His voice is used in exactly 16 lines, with 17 sentences spoken. The terminator has two other lines onscreen, one with the voice of a police officer overdubbed, and one with the voice of Sarah's mother overdubbed. There are also many lines with the voice of Sarah's mother, and we learn that the terminator is actually saying them, but we don't see it. Arnie also taught the world is now infamous catchphrase "I'll be back", which was originally scripted as "I'll come back". (Just doesn't have the same ring to it, does it?) There is only one time that Michael Biehn and Arnie are in the same frame together. It is when Kyle blasts The Terminator the second time at Tech Noir. When they finally meet in the factory, it is not Arnie, just a metallic puppet.<br /><br />As with all James Cameron DVDs (everything except Titanic - um, HELLO - and Terminator 3, since it wasn't done by him) there are loads of extras on this, most of them pretty tedious if you're not interested in a blow by blow account of every single scene. These include: Terminator A Retrospective; 'Other Voices' documentary; deleted scenes, four trailers (foreign, alternative, teaser, and TV spots); James Cameron's artwork stills; production photos; Stan Winston's photos; visual effects photos; publicity materials; original treatment script stills, and on the DVD-ROM: original treatment script, 1983 fourth draft script and final shooting script.<br /><br />Personally, I'll always prefer the second and third movies to this, but it's still great, as it really introduced the whole story to the viewing audience. The second and third have slightly better effects, plus the third has a female Terminator plus Arnie! Always a must for the guys in the audience.</p></body></html>

Special effects are used well in this movie, and the writing was done well. And good god, the actress who played Umbridge was spot-on, right down to the sugary-sweet voice, attire, and office decor! So many movies prove to be disappointing adaptations, but so far, the movies for the Harry Potter series continue to deliver.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Glory Days" Revisited"></head><body><p>There's a scene in the beginning of `Rocky Balboa' where I thought of Bruce Springsteen's famous song, "Glory Days".  Rocky has long since retired from boxing and has bought an Italian restaurant in Philly.  One night he's schmoozing with his guests from table to table.  He's enthusiastically telling his favorite stories in the ring when one guest cuts him off to finish the ending.  They've heard it all before.  And so have we.  In the Springsteen song, there's the punch line, "...The time of glory...leaves you with nothing, Mister, but boring stories of...glory days."  They weren't boring; it's just there's nothing new to tell.  The rest of the movie finds Rocky wanting to make new stories.  Seldom does `Rocky Balboa' seem like a sentimental reunion that only clings to the past.  Rather, the flashbacks melt well into the present day.  What we know goes well with what's new.<br /><br />Adrianne has died and their son, Rocky, Jr. (Burt Young) has grown into a semi-successful white collar worker.  He's the apple of dad's eye, but Rocky's own "glory days" cast a shadow on his son.  He offers his son some philosophical words we can all take to heart:  "It's not how hard you fight in life.  It's how hard you can take the punches..."  Rocky still has ties with Paulie (Burt Young) the one who lent him the meat locker.  His advice to Rocky is also sage:  "You're living life backwards, Rocco...Change channels."  So the aging Rocky clings to his memories of Adriane, pains after years of physical strain, and his reluctant retirement.  As one might guess, he gets a second chance.  I was so impressed with the development, I had to smile at how Sylvester Stallone pulled it off .<br /><br />Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is that second chance.  A notorious champion, Dixon's a prima dona who doesn't give his opponents much of a chance.  (He reminds us of the contrast between growing up watching Ali and Frasier fight splendidly for free and today's debacles on Pay-per-view.)  Once opponents and a huge audience seem elusive, Dixon's promoters brainstorm an exhibition fight with Rocky, one that is meant to create interest, partly as a fund-raiser.  It also is meant to resolve ESPN's speculative computer simulation of two boxers from different eras match up.<br /><br />With some effective scenes that warm up the heart between Paulie, an old acquaintance Marie (Geraldine Hughes), her grown son, Rocky's son--and the loving bond they share despite their differences--there's plenty of tender moments.  (And none of them stem from the meat locker.)  Then, they put on a fine show.  Plausible developments come to the fore in the ring where Stallone's stylish freeze-frame approach manages well with the poignant flashbacks, artfully done like none before in the 'Rocky' franchise.  'Rocky Balboa' offers many rounds of heartfelt entertainment and wisely ducks from any false sentimentality.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The greatest show on TV..."></head><body><p>I'm writing this review right after watching the season finale. This is one hell of a good show. I wish I could meet the writers of this series and ask them "Where on earth do you come up with this stuff?" That's some really good $hit they give us every week. At the end of every show, I go "F**k!" because it's so nerve wrecking thinking what's gonna happen next. The intensity is just unbelievable!<br /><br />OK, I guess I should calm down and write this review. As you can see, the excitement really gets to me. When I first heard of this show, I thought it was some lame Survivor kind of rip-of. But right after watching the first few minutes of the show, I knew I couldn't have been more wrong. This show is basically about a group of plane crash survivors. They land on this island that they know nothing of. Every episode, we see how these people survive. We are given glimpses of the person's life before the crash, and how it led them on to the flight which crashed. Most, if not all of the people's stories reveal a side of the people that we do not expect, some more surprising than others. And that's not all, the island itself is a mystery. Weird noises are heard at night, but what is making those sounds? Strange events start to occur which is impossible to explain. The survivors soon find out that they are not alone in the island, there are others but who are they? These are just some of the many things that progresses over time in this show. C'mon, how anyone could resist this show is totally beyond me.<br /><br />First of all, I have to say kudos to the writers. The stories are written in such a way, that it intrigues you, it draws you in. The anticipation to watch the following week's episode is really killing you. I am usually at the edge of my seat watching this show, literally! And I didn't even realize it until someone pointed it out to me. That's how much this show grabs you. Next, this show has a killer cast. Never have I seen a cast which works so well with the show. Their acting never fails to evoke some kind of emotion within me, and that sure doesn't happen much. You find yourself really caring what happens to each of them. Other than those factors, I just think that everything works in perfect symphony for this show, thus the 5-star rating. The lighting, the set, the directing...everything!<br /><br />In short, this is THE show to watch. The DVD set is not even released and I've already pre-ordered it. And I've never pre-ordered anything before. At a time when TV networks are flooded with teen dramas and reality crap, this is a refreshing change. I love this show, it's off to a good start and if these guys can end this series with the same intensity that they started it...this might very well be one of those classic TV shows that people talk about 10, 20 years from now. Keep up the good work Lost!</p></body></html>

Instead, the viewer is set upon by a bloated script that lacks intelligence and charm. Even the main character, Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger), our formerly lovable every woman, seems to have lost some of her winning ways, as what previously seemed effortless, now seems too contrived. Quite frankly, this film simply does not reach the heights of excellence that the prequel did. So, those viewers who loved the original film will be disappointed.<br /><br />The direction of this film seems ham-handed, with a screenplay that simply tries too hard to be all that the original was.  Unfortunately, it fails in its execution, hampered with too many sub-plots that are simply not funny. Colin Firth (Marc Darcy) and Hugh Grant (Daniel Cleaver) reprise their original roles and manage to hang onto their charm, but their dialogue rings hollow, as they struggle with a script not worthy of them. Ms. Zellweger also struggles with her role, as at times it calls for her to act totally stupid, something that the original screenplay did not require. The screenwriters obviously confused stupidity with naivet&eacute;.  It is a shame that they were unable to come up with something worthier of the wonderful talent in this film. While there are some funny moments in the film, they are few and far between. In fact, some of the film is downright painful to watch. Still, those moviegoers who viewed the first film should see this sequel and judge for themselves. They should, however, rent rather than buy it.</p></body></html>

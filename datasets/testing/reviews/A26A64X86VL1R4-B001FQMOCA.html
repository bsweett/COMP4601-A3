Of particular enjoyment were the scenes early in his career where Cash was touring and partying with Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison and Elvis.<br /><br />As seems inevitable in a biopic about a major star, we see the ravages of touring and drugs, how they almost ruin his life and then he is able, with the support of June Carter and her family, to kick the habit.  The contrast between June's loving family and Cash's hard unforgiving father makes you see how a lack of love in childhood can cause severe damage to an adult and result in self-destructive behaviors.<br /><br />"I Walk the Line" is more of a story of how an emotionally damaged man repairs his psyche enough to have decent relationships rather than the development of a star and his calling as a musician.<br /><br />Joacquin Phoenix does a nice job but the real star of the film is  Reese Witherspoon whose beauty and talented portrayal of June Carter steal the show.  Definitely a must see!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THERE'S NOTHING BAD ABOUT THIS ONE!"></head><body><p>all i kept hearing about this movie is about how bad it was, and things like that. all negative, nothing positive not even about the actors, but i decided to let myself be the judge that way no one else to blame but myself. well, i'm glad i did. this movie was bangin. the script was great, the whole story line and all. kind of left me with my mouth open towards the end. i mean they really feed you the story and the actors do there job so well that you believe it all. i mean why shouldn't you, then BAM that twist and the end. did not see it coming i must say. very unexpected. it kind of makes you mad you know. you kind of start feeling sorry for clive owen, poor man, but he should'nt have been trying to cheat. kind of teaches you a lesson this movie does. it's hard to see who can you trust these days, and that you have to think of the consequences of your action. i really enjoyed it. clive owen is a great actor, and played it like a man in trouble to the T. as for jennifer aniston, well done, she was good. put all the emotions and depth to her character. as for the villian, vincent cassel, makes you hate him, but we must not forget it is a movie. very well done man. anyway in my eyes good film.</p></body></html>

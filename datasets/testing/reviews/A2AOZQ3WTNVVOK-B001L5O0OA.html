<meta name="summary" content="A Modern Family Christmas Classic"></head><body><p>How do movies become classics?  I am clueless to answer.  I do not remember seeing "A Christmas Story" advertised in 1983.  This movie did very poorly in theaters.  Perhaps this low-budget film suffered from lack of support.  The movie does not compare with typical Christmas movie releases that emphasize mega-budgets and big-name stars.  Maybe we were all looking in the wrong place for entertainment.<br /><br />The movie is based on the late Jean Shepherd's book, "In God We Trust, All Other's Pay Cash."  Jean Shepherd also narrates this marvelous movie, as well as appearing in the film.  Jean's narration is wonderful and really helps to make this movie successful.  The story is inspired by real life events (even if they did not happen to Jean, they happened to others - trust me on this).  Jean managed to capture the feel of Christmas in the Midwest in the post-World War II era.  Actually, the Midwest had this feel into the 1950's and 1960's.  I recall myself asking for a BB gun in the 1960's and the answer was - yep, you guessed it - you'll shoot your eye out!<br /><br />The Midwest has always been a peculiar place when compared with the coasts.  While the Midwest is just as advanced as either coast, it somehow feels more nostalgic and archaic.  In some small towns, like the fictional Hohman, Indiana, entering town feels like stepping back several decades.  The display windows of stores were a big deal in past decades, from coast to coast.  Toy trains were often a feature of window displays.  The display in Higbee's (which was a real chain of stores in Ohio) was a classic store display.  I admit that I fail to recall the kind of store Santa that Higbee's had.  The Santa's that I visited in the past had fancy chairs, but they were on the ground.<br /><br />The bully was nicely played in this movie.  As Jean Shepherd noted after the incident between Ralphie and Farkus, once you stood up to the bullies they often stopped bothering you.  I guess it was only fun being a bully when the smaller kids ran away.<br /><br />Ralphie and the broken glasses is also classic.  Glasses were expensive and parent continually advised their children to take care of them.  Ralphie had to think fast after accidentally crunching his glasses.  If Ralphie had revealed that he stepped on his glasses after they fell off because of a ricocheting BB, his parents would like have confiscated his BB gun until he turned 50, or maybe older.<br /><br />The list of events in this movie that defines an era is lengthy.  As I noted before, while the specific incidents may not have been true, they were inspired by actual events.  Jean Shepherd did a phenomenal job of capturing the essence of a region and an era.  Jean clearly loved his childhood in the Midwest, his parents and had a strong nostalgia for an era that is rapidly fading into the distant past.<br /><br />Does the movie have a "message," which one reviewer suggested the movie does not?  This movie has lots of messages.  Note Ralphies' reaction to his Little Orphan Annie decoder; Message:  It's a crummy commercial.  Ralphies' first experience with his Red Ryder BB gun; Message:  Your parent's may actually know what they are talking about and you should take greater care in following their advice.  Ralphie and the bullies; Message:  Sometimes you need to stop letting bullies push you around.  Okay, enough messages.  This movie is filled with messages.  If you failed to find one, you were looking somewhere else - like your navel, or a picture book.<br /><br />Though there is minimal significance to awards for a movie like this, this movie obtained nominations for thirteen awards of various types, and it won two.  Good job!<br /><br />"A Christmas Story" may only be a great family Christmas movie for a while.  That "while" may only be as long as there are enough of us that remember the 1940's, the 1950's and the early 1960's.  Until then, I plan to watch this movie again and again.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

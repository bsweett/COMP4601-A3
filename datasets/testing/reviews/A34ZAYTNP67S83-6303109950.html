<meta name="summary" content="No classic, but not rustic, either..."></head><body><p>Released just before the debacle that was &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, &quot;Tombstone&quot; succeeds where that film fails in almost every way.<p>&quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; deals with Earp's childhood, and may be more historically accurate than the artistic liberties taken with THIS film, but it's less interesting as a result.  &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; was a film in need of a serious editor, but &quot;Tombstone&quot; involves you very early, and only really loses steam in the last five minutes.<p>The denoument after Johnny Ringo is killed seems almost perfunctory, not to mention rushed.  But that's a minor complaint.<p>Val Kilmer might be over-the-top in this outing, but he's a lot of fun, and you can tell he's enjoying himself.  He practically walks away with the film, although Kurt Russell is passable as Wyatt Earp.  Sam Elliott is great, as always, and the rest of the supporting cast is mostly spot on in their respective parts.<p>The exceptions being Jason Priestly (why was he even billed?), the underused Billy Zane (miscast as an Englishman), and Dana Delany as the love interest; she turns in an unbelievably bad (and grating, to boot) performance, and she's actually the most jarring element of the film.<p>The film wisely deals with the best part of the Earp saga (the shootout at the OK Corral), and while it might have most western purists up in arms, it's still tremendously watchable.</p></body></html>

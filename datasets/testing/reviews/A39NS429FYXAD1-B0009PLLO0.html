<meta name="summary" content="A nice historical interpretation, but little else..."></head><body><p>This is a fanciful and somewhat interesting interpretation on the life of Alexander the Great,  but as a film epic it is sorely lacking...especially in the screenplay and leading performances.  Jolie, Farrell, Kilmer, Hopkins and Plummer are all wasted...buried under hair and makeup effects.  Jared Leto seems to have fallen in from MTV.  Alexander is more of a hysteric than a hero and this Director's Cut is particularly long and tough to endure without a few hits of the Pause button.<br /><br />The Director's Commentary track, however, is the most worthwhile thing about this...for hearing Oliver Stone's own opinion, thoughs and defense of his title character is a bit like attending a university lecture by a professor who is very ethusiastic about his subject matter.</p></body></html>

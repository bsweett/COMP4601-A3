Most people interested in film already know this film.  Most think this film to be one of the best, myself included.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were both major stars when this film was made but this film took them to an even higher level of stardom.<br /><br />Casablanca is a French province and therefore only under occupational German forces.  This is the place where those trying to escape the war have fled.<br /><br />Rick (Bogie) is the owner of the shady caf&eacute; (and casino).  He fled Paris when the Germans arrived.  He was split away from his love Ilsa (Bergman).  One night in his casino, Ilsa appears.  At first Rick thinks that his love has returned.  Then he finds out that she is married and to the Nazi's most wanted man, Victor Lazlo.  Rick has two authentic travel visas.  The question is are they for Rick and Ilsa or Ilsa and Victor.<br /><br />This is one of the great war movies, one of the great romance movies, one of the a films.<br /><br />This film has two DVD releases: this one and a special edition with additional featurettes.  The question is for each buyer is do you want to spend the extra money for extra featurettes.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS:<br /><br />Documentary - You Must Remember This - Hosted by Mrs. Bogart (Lauren Bacall) - Excellent<br /><br />Introduction by Lauren Bacall - Again excellent</p></body></html>

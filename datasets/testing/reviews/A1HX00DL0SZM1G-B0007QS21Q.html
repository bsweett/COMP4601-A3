That is all.<br /><br />Will Smith ("Bad Boys II") stars in the role of a lifetime as Detective Spooner, an experienced homicide detective investigating the apparent suicide of Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell of HBO's "Six Feet Under"). Lanning's suicide is all the more disturbing since he was on the brink of integrating a more advanced form of robot, the NS5, into the modern world for the company CRS (the Microsoft of robots).<br /><br />CRS owner Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, "Hollywood Homicide") doesn't want Lanning's death messing up his company's biggest payday, so he is leery of Spooner snooping around and spoiling his big moment.<br /><br />Spooner doesn't share the general populace's good will toward robots--which have taken on menial roles such as trash men, deliverymen and dog walkers--and likens them to ticking time bombs. Forming a loose alliance with Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, "The Recruit"), Spooner becomes convinced that Lanning's death was the handiwork of an evolved robot, Sonny (voice by Alan Tudyk, "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story").<br /><br />"I, Robot" is less an all-out action film as it is a mystery with some riveting action scenes tossed in from time to time to get across how pivotal the stakes are for Spooner.<br /><br />Smith is excellent as he fully establishes a unique character, doing it so naturally that he never appears to be acting.<br /><br />Recent films based on the short stories of sci-fi writers Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov have ranged from pretty good ("Minority Report") to "it was a better concept than movie" ("Imposter"). "I, Robot," based on some of Asimov's short stories but changed for a high-energy summer audience, is the type of sci-fi thriller film that Ben Affleck, John Woo and Uma Thurman were attempting with last year's box-office bomb, "Paycheck," based on a Dick novel.<br /><br />"I, Robot" is the genre's most cinematic edge-of-your seat thrill ride thanks to the sharp screenplay by Akiva Goldsman ("A Beautiful Mind") and Jeff Vintar ("Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"). Their handiwork makes all of the characters, even the robots, fully developed players in this mystery.<br /><br />The film feels as if it's actually in the future, and not just because a subtitle says so.<br /><br />Budgetary restraints limit the creativity and imagination of most directors, who seem content to portray the future as a world with just one or two technological advancements and shiny clothes.<br /><br />While that's probably more realistic than hovercars and Jetson-like food processors, half the fun of the best sci-fi films is seeing how each filmmaker's view of the future differs.<br /><br />In director Alex Proyas' vision, the future is very imaginative, with buildings that literally take cars and hang them in closet-like parking garages, cars that drive themselves and cell phones that clip on to ears.<br /><br />Proyas ("Garage Days") also brings a different perspective to the tired old fight scene by using rotating cameras and wide camera angles so the viewer can actually see what's going on, resulting in innovation not seen since the original "Matrix."<br /><br />The robots have an eerie dynamic to them, and even with their bland faces they're very creepy. Fittingly, the robotic CGI (computer generated images) are appropriately wooden and stiff until they get angry, which is when they move around like a horde of roaches.<br /><br />Much in the same way that "Blade Runner" (based on another Dick novel) redefined the science-fiction/suspense genre in the 1980s, "I, Robot" should do the same for a new generation.<br /><br />Since it's not a sequel, "I, Robot" was the first big 2004 summer flick that didn't have a built-in audience, which made it a pleasant surprise.</p></body></html>

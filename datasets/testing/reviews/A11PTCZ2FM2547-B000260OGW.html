<meta name="summary" content="A Huge Disappointment"></head><body><p>Buoyed by what I had read and heard about this movie from critics, pundits, and TV talking heads, I couldn't wait to see the latest "Great Western."  The minute OPEN RANGE hit the cinema in my little corner of the prairie, I was there, waiting to soak up everything from the cow chips to the gunsmoke.<p>What a disappointment.  Instead of being entertained, I sat through 150 minutes of a cliched, tired, and ultimately boring story--a story as slow as molasses in the winter time.  Equally frustrating was the film's complete lack of originality, as it plucked plots from "Unforgiven," "High Noon," "Pale Rider," "Tombstone," and a host of other Westerns.  If this film was a dog (and it was), it would be the biggest mongrel in the pound.<p>Kevin Costner mopes and mutters through his role as an open range cowpuncher with a troubled past, while Robert Duvall more or less revives the character of Augustus McCrae from "Lonesome Dove."  The climactic "gunfight"--while impressive--is over the top, and requires a titanic suspension of disbelief.  And I'm still trying to figure out Annette Bening's role in this movie.  In fact, I'm still trying to figure out why I didn't get up and leave the theater.  Had to be the buttered popcorn.<br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

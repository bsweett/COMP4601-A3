Our characters are caught up in a wild treasure hunt which has high stakes--if the treasure is not found, Captain Jack Sparrow must lose his life to the dreaded Davy Jones!<br /><br />In order to really enjoy this show, you must take embrace the notion that you are on a fun-house ride with a pirate motif.  Then you can really enjoy the fun of the piece.  Johnny Depp is absurdly likeable and genuinely funny as he swishes and capers for the camera and employs body movements similar to cartoon figures.  It is clear that in Captain Jack Sparrow, Depp's homage to Brando's effeminate characterization of the macho man is taken to a burlesque level.  It worked for me! This was partly due to Depp's commitment to his interpretation of the role.  His silliness was nicely contrasted by the sensuality of his glance and enhanced by the heavy kohl around his eyes.<br /><br />Dead man's chest is a pun about treasure.  Is treasure gold or "something shiny" residing in a wooden treasure chest as suggested by the snaggle toothed pirates of the film?  Or is treasure what resides in the human chest-treasures of the heart?  Despite this rather depthful notion, this pirate movie does not explore this motif in detail.  Rather our heroes careen around the Mediterranean, like the boats in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, from one skirmish to the other, seeking treasure.<br /><br />My only quibble might be that the ending left us with no resolution but rather an abrupt stop suggesting a sequel.</p></body></html>

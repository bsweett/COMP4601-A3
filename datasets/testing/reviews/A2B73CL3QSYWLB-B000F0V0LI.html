<meta name="summary" content="Violent Ending Nearly Fatal to "The Cowboys""></head><body><p>I was enjoying "The Cowboys" for about half the film.  The central premise, a desparate cattle rancher engaging young boys for a drive, is a promising one and for a good portion the makers of the film execute it well.  John Wayne, in the sunset of his storied career, had a good rapport with his young charges.  Roscoe Lee Browne provided lighthearted relief as the philosophical cook.  Then the film turns unexpectedly dark.  One of the boys dies in a freak accident.  Bruce Dern appears as a psychotic cattle rustler.  Dern is a favorite actor of mine but his character seemed like he belonged in another picture.  Revenge must be meted out and the boys dish it out with a vengeance.  This left a sour taste in my mouth which is unfortunate because this film had such promise.</p></body></html>

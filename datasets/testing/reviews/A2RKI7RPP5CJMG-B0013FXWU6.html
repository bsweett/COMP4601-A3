Only the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as Eli Sunday save "There Will Be Blood" from being a terrible film.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson empties out a bag of tricks in order to make this movie appeal to award-giving crowd, thus eliminating the interests of most movie-goers.  Lewis is a greedy, driven oilman intent on getting the most profit from his victims by using his own down-to-earth sales pitch and cute son.  Dano plays a preacher intent on doing the same thing, but through conning the crowd as a fire and brimstone preacher.  The two lock horns when Plainview buys Sunday's family farm from his father at a bargain and then blowing off Eli and his requests for money for the church.<br /><br />The film runs about an hour too long and is littered throughout with long shot sequences, erratic music and, in actuality, very little blood.  Many have accused Anderson of either stealing from Stanley Kubrick or paying homage to him through this film.  Either way, he's no Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />Lewis and Dano play their respective characters very well.  Plainview is a complete jerk, even to his son.  There is a very matter-of-factness in Lewis' delivery of lines that makes the character worth struggling through the plodding script to see.  Dano's Sunday is just as vicious, but in a much more sinister and silent way.  Only when he's preaching does he really raise his voice.  He also has a violent streak, as the viewer will witness during an interaction with his father.<br /><br />Overall, this film is average.  There is nothing entirely terrible about it but there's nothing entirely great either.  Dano and Lewis do great jobs with what they're given, but it's not enough to give "There Will Be Blood" more than three stars.  Recommended as a rental, unless you believe that every film that's ever won some type of award truly deserved it.</p></body></html>

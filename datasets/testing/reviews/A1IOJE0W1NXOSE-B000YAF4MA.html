<meta name="summary" content="Two masterful actors elevate the material"></head><body><p>In this movie, the characters played by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman could not be more different.  Jack is a white millionaire while Morgan is a black mechanic.  Jack has virtually no family whereas Morgan is surrounded with a loving wife and children.  Jack is reckless and daring while Morgan carefully considers his moves.  Jack is a man without faith whereas Morgan's life is centered on his faith.  They meet in a hospital room where they find out that their days are numbered.  Instead of staying around to die, they set off with their "Bucket List", which contains the things they want to do before they "kick the bucket".  In what is certainly the "fun" part of the movie, they circle the globe and participate in the activities that they've dreamed about all their lives.  There is humor, pathos, and a bit of philosophy thrown in.  Reality rears its ugly head, particularly during the first part of the movie, but these two great actors carry it all off with grace, humor, and aplomb.  Kudos to the person who cast Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson in the starring roles.</p></body></html>

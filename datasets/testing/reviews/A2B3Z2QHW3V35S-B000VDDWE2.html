<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie"></head><body><p>This is a great movie. It is also scary to watch. People say this is a warning that this movie will one day become part of our life's. I heard that the person who wrote this movie is a person who has been warning people about this happening. No one was listening to him. So that is why he made the movie. I don't know if that is all true. But I hope we can make a change in our way of living so this wont happen to us.<br /><br />Besides that this is an awesome movie. That you don't want to miss. The sadist scene for me is with the cancer child who's parents didn't go for him and the nurse stayed by his side the whole time. My sister had cancer around that little boy's age. I know that is just a movie, but I can't see how his parents couldn't go be with him. That scene makes my eyes water.</p></body></html>

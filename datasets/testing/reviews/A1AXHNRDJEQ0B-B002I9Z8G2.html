<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good film - mainly for TNG fans"></head><body><p>Not having seen any other Star Trek feature film for years, I can't compare 'First Contact' to any other film and exclaim that 'This is the best Star Trek film ever!, etc. I'm not even a ranid fan of the show, but I &aacute;m fimiliar with the TNG characters & 'mythology'to have a solid enough background for enjoying the film.<br /><br />The film itself is a nice action filmwith a Star Trek twist, and a nice & interesting twist at that. It's only drawback is the fact that it does need some fimiliarity with the Star trek universe & mythology, which would make it very hard for non - trekkies to understand, enjoy, ad get into one of the most wonderful TV series ever!</p></body></html>

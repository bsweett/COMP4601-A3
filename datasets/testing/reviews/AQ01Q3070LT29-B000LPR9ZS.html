More gore included.<br />SAW II (2005) was a huge success!  When we last left the intense dilemma, Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) had beaten Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and through the maze of walls and doors in the warehouse, it was a race against time to find his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) and the other victims. Amanda was the culprit and Eric found himself in the bathroom from SAW (2004). He was trapped, shackled, shut-in and yelling for his life.<br />Lions Gate/Twisted Pictures presents SAW III (2006).  The movie begins at the exact frame where SAW II ended.<br />  Tobin Bell, Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Dina Meyer, Franky G, Leigh Whannel and Billy the Puppet return for this third film.<br />  Kerry (Dina Meyer) can not find Eric (Donnie Wahlberg), but her and Forensic Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) they find the remains of Troy (J. Larose). We are treated with scenes of him shackled with chains imbedded into his skin.  Since Kerry is so clever in solving the crime, she too becomes a prisoner of Jigsaw.<br />  We are introduced to two new characters: Lynn and Jeff.<br />  Lynn (Bahar Soomekh),who is a doctor, is captured in the hospital locker room by someone wearing a pig head. By Amanda (Shawnee Smith) she is brought to Jigsaw John, who is gravely ill lying in a hospital bed in a new secret place, the Gideon warehouse.  He wants Lynn to help him live. A collar device is put over her. There are 5 cocked gun barrels on this collar. If Jigsaw John's heart rate flat lines or she moves out of range, she will die at the same time as him.<br />  A man, Jeff (Angus MacFadyen), is trapped in a crate box. Jeff escapes and as he wonders through the warehouse, finds other people in deadly traps, Danica (Debra Lynne McCabe), Judge Halden (Barry Flatman) and Timothy (Mpho Koaho). He has his own series of tests to go through. That's part of the game.<br /><br />  For SAW fans, new footage: Amanda will reflect upon how she became involved with Jigsaw John and then preparing for the first game we saw in SAW (2004).<br /><br />  Costas Mandylor appears as "Forensic Hoffman" in SAW 3. This is a very important clue for SAW 4.<br /><br />  Best line: The only place that he can get those drugs is in the hospital.<br />  Writer and Executive Producer Leigh Whannel plays "Adam".<br />  The neck collar was once worn by Tina Turner in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985).<br /><br />***Thank you Donnie Wahlberg and Franky G.(as the corpse) for returning to SAW III.<br /><br />  Gregg Hoffman who passed away December 4, 2005, after the release of SAW II (2005) was given credit as Producer for SAW III.<br /><br />  Special Features:<br /><br />  The Traps of Saw 3 (9 min.)<br />  The Props of Saw 3 (8 min.)<br />  Darren's Diary (9 min.)<br />  2 deleted scenes<br />  3 different audio commentaries found in "Set-Up"<br />  movie trailer and teaser<br /><br /> Option of subtitles in English, Spanish.<br /><br /> The Full Screen Unrated Edition contains previews of Crank (2006), Special Editions of Saw (2004), Saw 2 (2005), Punisher (2004) Extended Editions,The Invincible Iron Man cartoon (2007), Hostel Part II (2007).<br /><br />DVD container is wrapped in tight plastic, but please be careful, there is also a protective see-through cover slip that lifts off that you need to save. Notice the security seals still on your container. You can carefully peel these or cut them. I prefer to leave them intact. The DVD itself looks like a saw blade with a picture of Tobin Bell on it.<br /><br />Producers claim their is still more unseen footage of SAW III.<br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UO4F8E">Saw III - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> was released on DVD October 23, 2007.<br /><br />  Followed by:<br /><br />  SAW IV (2007). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001053042">Saw IV (Unrated Full Screen Edition)</a><br />  SAW V (2008). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L9EXUC">Saw V: Director's Cut (Unrated)</a><br />  SAW VI (2009). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00275EHFU">Saw VI (Widescreen Unrated Edition)</a><br />  SAW 3D: The Final Chapter (2010) aka SAW VII<br /><br /> Update: December 2011.

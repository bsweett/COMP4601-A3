<meta name="summary" content="Shockingly good sequel"></head><body><p>Saw II is that rare movie that stays intriguing and believable the entire way through, while maintaining a cohesive storyline and gore to spare. The acting is solid, the scares are real, and the viewer is trying just as hard as Donnie Wahlberg's Detective Matthews to solve the mystery. What's most amazing is that all the clues really are right before your eyes.<br /><br />At the beginning of the film, Jigsaw has committed another grisly murder, and left his calling card for Detective Matthews to track him down. Matthews reluctantly takes the case and quickly locates Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) in his warehouse lair. But this is only the beginning of another one of Jigsaw's intricate games.<br /><br />Now eight people, including Matthews' son, are trapped in a house where deadly nerve gas is seeping through the walls and into their bodies. As the police try to locate the house and figure out a way to rescue the prisoners, they are also trying to figure their own way out together, while fighting amongst themselves to find out what connects them all.<br /><br />The suspense in this film is palpable and Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is one of the best horror franchise "bad guys" in years. His twisted sense of morality: "Those that don't appreciate life do not deserve it" is the kind of terrible explanation that makes a psychopath real and frightening.<br /><br />The twists that this film takes are surprising and show the kind of intelligence that the majority of horror schlock coming out these days is severely lacking.<br /><br />The DVD extras are truly spectacular. The viewer gets a look at how the set designers laid out every one of the various traps in the film, from the needle pit to the furnace trap. All the props are also examined (the bat with nails in it, etc.). Overall, this is the kind of horror film that is watchable over and over again and the kind of film that makes a great addition to any collection.</p></body></html>

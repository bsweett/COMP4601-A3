My friend and I were a little early for the main show and saw the end of Lebowski, didn't really think much about it.  We saw the main show and i think we stayed for a bit of Lebowski.  I had never heard of the Coen brothers nor this film and it certainly was silly....However I ended up liking it in spite of myself.<br /><br />Now, years later I watched it properly, from beginning to end...and I've seen a number of the Coens' other films and have due respect for them.  And I think I like this almost the best of all.  I loved Oh Brother, but that was mainly for the sound track.  What I like about this is it's so unpretentious and joyously dopey.  It's blessed with a terrific cast--they must have had a wonderful time making it, unhampered by the pressure of having to make a serious art film.  And the fun comes across.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, for sure. One thing that did bother me was the excessive use of the f-word.  I'm no prude but really....If somehow that word were prohibited from film making the Coens would be out of business.  Still I'll take that over all the blood and gore of some of their other films.  One missing toe is the worst you'll find here.</p></body></html>

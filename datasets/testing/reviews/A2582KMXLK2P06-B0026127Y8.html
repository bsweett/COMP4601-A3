The hype this movie received was almost too much to take!  It got to the point where the hype alone was turning me off.<br /><br />Well it's been a year later, and I watched Taken tonight for the very first time trying to forget about those annoyingly repetitive commercials.<br /><br />I started out VERY disappointed.  I have to be honest about that.  The very beginning of the movie shows the single father having memories of his daughter's birthday party from when she was just a little girl.  We've seen the same thing a MILLION times in other movies.  I was preparing myself for a very overrated and predictable film.  Some of the scenes even had a low budget feel to them.<br /><br />The next 20 minutes didn't win me over either.  The father goes to his daughter's birthday party (he wasn't dreaming about it this time) to bring her a gift.<br /><br />Then the fathers ex-wife enters the picture.  The two of them start talking and obviously they don't get along (filled with sarcastic little shots in between of course!)<br /><br />Of course, her new husband enters the picture as well, pretends to be friends with the daughter's father, but you know very well they could never be friends because they talk in a way where it's plainly obvious they don't care about each other in the slightest, and then the father leaves the birthday party and returns home.<br /><br />That's the first 20 minutes of film- horribly predictable story-telling we must have seen a million times.  So it's VERY important to keep watching past those 20 minutes.<br /><br />When the actual story kicks in concerning the daughter having to get her fathers approval to take a vacation to France (by way of a signature signing taking place in a restaurant) *this* is when the plot development really gets interesting.<br /><br />The father is reluctant to send his daughter to a foreign country for safety reasons, but eventually he gives in.  Otherwise he'd been considered a horrible father.<br /><br />When the daughter arrives to France with her one friend, you see them having fun and dancing around in a hotel room.  The daughter walks into another room, and through a window she sees her friend being attacked and kidnapped by three or four strange men that walked into the room.  She panics, so she hides under a bed.<br /><br />This is where you have to take into consideration the storyline is fictional, because the daughter calls up the father while hiding under a bed, and tells him what's going on with her friend.<br /><br />The father then calmly and precisely gives his daughter instructions on how to handle the situation.<br /><br />I was like "Are you SERIOUS!"  Most fathers would become emotional, confused and worried if such a situation were to present itself.  Apparently this father thought he was some kind of superman who not only knew how to tell a darn good well-prepared speech, but also had an ability to remain completely calm over the phone WHILE the daughter was being taken away by the bad guys!<br /><br />How is this possible?  Only in Hollywood.  Besides those little problems, the rest of the storyline is rather amazingly action-packed and features lots of shootings, violence, and killings, which is the norm for these kind of films.  I really enjoyed the movie after getting past all those predictable and impossible to believe moments.<br /><br />So the film is great in the end.</p></body></html>

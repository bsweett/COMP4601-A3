Sandra Bullock plays a single doctor who has a void in her life and an unsure path for her future. Suddenly, a mysterious pen pal leaves her letters in the mailbox of her rental lake house. She finds herself falling for a man that she's never met and living two years apart! What she doesn't realize is that she has met him in her past and they are linked in a way she hasn't figured out until it's nearly too late. Will there ever be a time when the past catches up to the present and they can be together?<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Victim or victimizer?"></head><body><p>A fourteen year old girl, Hayley (Ellen Page), chatting on the internet meets a 32 year old photographer whose moniker is 'lensmaster319', but who's real name is Jeff (Patrick Wilson).  They arrange to meet in a coffee shop called Nighthawks.<br /><br />Hayley is far too wise for her years, and Jeff's feeble attempts to prove himself above picking up on her are washed away in her innocent insistence that he take her to his house to hear a bootleg MP3.  What ensues is a game of cat-and-mouse, but who is the cat and who is the mouse?<br /><br />'Hard Candy' is a psychological thriller, the entirety of the movie taking place between only two people in a singular environment, yet it manages to stay edgy and clever.  The performances are superb, the dialogue flowing and sharp, the script tight and true-to-form.  Even the atmospheric details (such as the obsessively clean house) rang true to profiling.<br /><br />While not a flash-action movie, 'Hard Candy' will still keep you riveted to your seat and your ears cocked toward the screen, wondering just what will happen next and how far the game will go.  Worth a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

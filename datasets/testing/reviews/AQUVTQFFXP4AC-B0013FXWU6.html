Always selective in his roles, he does the character of Daniel Plainview with such brilliant intensity, humor, love, hate, and subtlety that you never realize his character is changing as the movie progresses.<br /><br />The story is not at all highly dramatic and complex, following the simple story of Plainview's attempt to get at the vast ocean of oil beneath a small western village. The movie is primarily a character study, as Daniel takes up perhaps 90% of the movie.<br /><br />Paul Dano, as Eli Sunday, plays opposite Daniel not too often, but in such a social duel with one another that doesn't overwhelm or underwhelm. And you begin to notice throughout the movie that Eli becomes more and more like Daniel as the story progresses.<br /><br />The movie's focus on Daniel is done in such a way that the movie is about him, but not in a megalomaniacal way that he must be on screen at all times. Other characters shine around him, and play off of him to make their own characters that much more interesting.<br /><br />The music is highly unique, and definitely would break the movie if it were any different, or non-present at all.  It almost works like a silent movie if it were just the music and subtitles.  It could even work as a musical without singing.<br /><br />But the highest marks the movie gets, the most brilliant part of the film, the most frightening element of it, and the meaning behind my vaguely grotesque review title, is the fact that the character of Daniel Plainview is written and portrayed with such affection, reality, and depth, that he is very nearly a real person.  He could seem to be more real than many living people today.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis knows and perfectly executes every emotion the character would experience, in such a way that even when he goes overboard, it's utterly believable that such a character would say such a thing, or do such a thing.  There are no gaps in personality or lapses in logic.  From the beginning, you are frightened by how utterly real a person he is, and how utterly good-natured, kind-hearted, and human he is!  Even as he sets about his work, his primary concerns are less with making money and more with making sure his workers are provided for, the town (Little Boston) provided for, and everyone working happily at full capacity.<br /><br />Even as he slowly becomes insane, he retains aspects of humanity, as he sobs mournfully for his lost brother after learning the truth and killing the imposter Henry Plainview.  He even sobs, and drinks himself to sleep after confronting his son (at the end, when he's grown up), revealing he was an orphan he took care of after his father died, and severing all ties to him.  He does all he can for HW after the boy loses his hearing, and keeps careful tabs on him when he's sent away to a school for the deaf, constantly questioning Fletcher Hamilton about his accomodations.<br /><br />The nomination and subsequent winning of Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis, after watching this performance, is absolutely no contest.  I strongly and firmly believe that this was the best dramatic acting portrayal of all time.</p></body></html>

I cannot say that I "liked" the novel, but I was engrossed enough to complete it. Fast-forward a decade ... and the same applies to Tykwer's film-adaptation.<br /><br />Within the first few seconds, I felt a visceral repulsion to the film (as the viewer is expected to). The quick-cuts of the putrid marketplace creates revulsion and distance ... which is why many viewers here expressed a sense of "not caring about the characters" (this is valid). Likewise, Tykwer (true to Suskind) resists romanticizing Paris ... few directors are this straight-forward. The place is revealed as filthy, with a near-tangible stench (this is why we see members of aristocracy holding scented handkerchiefs under their noses). Even the long-shots of the city show stained, unappealing building facades. Who knew an artist could create a visual so fetid that the viewer can actual smell it?! Brilliance.<br /><br />Hoffman is convincing is his role as an aging perfumer. His portrayal of Giuseppe Baldini is as amusing as it is compelling. Likewise, Alan Rickman's "Richis" may be the character with whom the viewer can align her/himself. He is the voice of reason ... all of his "paranoid" obsessions are completely justified ... but no one will listen. His frustration is ours. Still, this is not enough to forge a connection between the film and the viewer. We find ourselves not caring when his beautiful daughter is being hunted for her scent. (And there is an attempt at garnering emotion ... evident in the delicate replacing of the flower on her mother's grave).<br /><br />This is a film with no catharsis (which is fine), but couple that with its dreary setting and vulgar displays, and the film becomes impossible to "like." This does not mean the film fails to intrigue, it simply means that a viewer may walk-away feeling empty. And, perhaps worse, wondering why the film was created at all. And, yes, it is true that Kubrick was intrigued by the text, but found it "unfilmable." I wonder what spurred Tykwer to tackle the text a master found "unfilmable"? One is forced to assume hubris was at work here ... and this gamble was not a (TECHNICALLY) successful one. The budget for this work was a staggering $65,800,000 and was an epic, box-office failure. In fact, I have never before or after read such a vehement review from the much esteemed Chicago Sun-Times Richard Roeper: "Hated this movie. Hated it" (his literal words). Still, consider the equally (perhaps even more) esteemed Ebert who found it "brave" (to paraphrase). I think it may be JUST that polarizing.<br /><br />My middle-of-the-road review is both an acknowledgment of the film's artistic merits and a recognition of its tendency to evince viewer-apathy (including mine).<br /><br />If you have an interest in seeing Suskind's work on-screen buy this film. If you were a huge fan of "Lola Rennt" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000021Y77">Run Lola Run</a>) then buy this film. However, if you are entering this work "blind" ... you may wish to rent it first.</p></body></html>

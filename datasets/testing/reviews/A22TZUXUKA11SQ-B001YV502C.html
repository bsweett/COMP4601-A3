The film begins with the death of the world's youngest person, Baby Diego. The world mourns his death in a manner usually reserved for larger than life figures like Mother Theresa and Princess Diana. Women weep in the streets and people stand transfixed by the television watching the report of his death. Baby Diego was 18 years old.<br /><br />In this version of the future, women are infertile and there hasn't been a human birth in nearly 20 years. Clive Owen plays Theo, a Brit who is just living day to day, but who has become lost in a world thrown into turmoil by its impending doom. Fertility tests are mandatory in this future, the world is at war, and Britain is the only place that seems to have some hold on civilization. Accordingly, people flock to get there, but the borders are strictly patrolled and refugees are locked in cages and displayed for all to see.<br /><br />Julianne Moore plays Julian, the leader of a "terrorist" organization called Fish, whose goal is to allow a home for every refugee who seeks asylum in Britain. She is also Theo's ex-wife. She comes to him after years of separation to ask him to help transport the first pregnant woman in nearly 20 years. It his her hope that the birth of this child might stop the turmoil and strife engulfing the country and possibly bring the world back from the brink of chaos.<br /><br />Children of Men paints a rather bleak picture of the future and, in this respect, was at times hard to watch. The world is torn apart by its impending doom and people have nothing left to live for.  This unborn child could give hope to the many who have lost it, but there are others who would use it for their own ends. This film was gripping, engaging, and moving despite the fact that it's also depressing, violent, and difficult to watch. The lack of a future has thrown the world into utter chaos with people being killed in the streets, the government dropping bombs at random, and anarchists fighting to put the world back in order. The fate of the future rests in the hands of someone who isn't even born yet, and that's something that's hard to perceive.  Still, I think Children of Men is definitely worth watching and it definitely starts the 2007 film season with a bang.</p></body></html>

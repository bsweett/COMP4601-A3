<meta name="summary" content="'Tis a gift to be simple..."></head><body><p>On the surface WAITRESS is a simple, honest, unpretentious, funny, tender, and sensitive film about simple people in a small Southern town: it is the core of the film, the examination of individual's choices, consequences, rights, and fraternity that makes the little Indie so special.  And another feature that adds a dimension of significance to the movie is that actress/writer/director Adrienne Shelly did not live to see the magic she created: Shelly was murdered in November 2006, a loss of a superb budding talent.<br /><br />Using a very small cast of characters WAITRESS takes place in a Pie Diner, owned by the crusty and demanding Old Joe (Andy Griffith), managed by the grumpy Cal (Lew Temple), and run by three waitresses - frumpy little Dawn (Adrienne Shelly) looking for love, been-there-done-that Becky (Cheryl Hines) whose married to a drooling waste, and Jenna (Keri Russell), an unhappily married (to Earl - Jeremy Sisto) pie maker expert who longs to leave her marriage but has just discovered she is pregnant.  She comes under the care of the OB-GYN Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion - also married) and in the course of her care the two fall in love.  How Jenna manages to cope with the disruptive pregnancy and the other waitresses deal with their simple lives is the crux of the story.  And while this simple plot lone doesn't appear to offer much, the manner in which it is written and acted makes is a little jewel.<br /><br />Many are touting the emergence of Keri Russell as a serious actress as the reason for seeing this film, but the real genius behind the honest simplicity of the story is the sadly deceased Adrienne Shelly.  She will be missed.  In a series of fitting homages the featurettes add to the DVD version of this film. Grady Harp, November 07</p></body></html>

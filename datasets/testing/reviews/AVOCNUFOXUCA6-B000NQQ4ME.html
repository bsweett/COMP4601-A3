Gibson wisely decided not to stretch this movie out into a 3+ hour epic, avoiding that temptation and keeping it just slightly flabby at about 2 hours 15 minutes.  There's nothing here story-wise you haven't seen before.  Imagine "The Patriot" in pre-Colombian Latin America, with the jungle dwellers as the colonists and the Mayans as the British, and you've hit about three quarters of the plot points of this movie.  It's not a bad film by any means, but it does keep reminding you of other movies you've seen before - just with a Yucutan flourish.<br /><br />I didn't care for the gross (pun intended) manipulativeness of the first act.  We know the Mayan city dwellers are bad people.  Whether they were human sacrificers in real life, I have no idea - I always thought it was the Aztecs that were the real bloodthirsty ones.  But the depredations suffered unto our heroic tribe were more than enough to make we the viewers cheer for revenge on the bad guys.  Of course, one could make a counter-argument that the first act simply shows the reality of brutal combat without romanticizing it, and I would be hard pressed to disagree.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is worth a rent, at least, if you don't mind some pretty brutal violence.</p></body></html>

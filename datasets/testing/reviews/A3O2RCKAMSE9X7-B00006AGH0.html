<meta name="summary" content="A Movie Less About Fear than about Calculation"></head><body><p>When THE SUM OF ALL FEARS was first released, the ads on television kept showing the same sequence again and again: an explosion of a nuclear device in America.  Naturally, the audience assumed that this was a movie that had an atomic bomb as the dramatic center, and that the film would focus on the results of that detonation.  Instead, what director Phil Robinson presented was a carefully crafted movie that asks the viewer to forget a few things while watching.  Robinson uses the unexpectedly fine acting of Ben Affleck, who plays a very junior CIA agent Jack Ryan, to divert the audience's attention from both some hugely noticeable plot gaffes and variations from Tom Clancy's novel. Clancy originally pictured the terrorists as Moslem extremists, and in the pre 9/11 political correctness, Robinson did not wish to alienate our many Moslem friends worldwide by suggesting that any of them could wish harm to America. Instead, he switches the villains to neo-Nazis, since even PC supporters do not hold them in high regard.  As one of these German terrorists was expounding his beliefs for the camera, he spoke in the same Teutonic cadences that used to characterize Erich von Stroheim back in the 40s.  All that this German failed to do was to stroke his mustache a la Snidely Whiplash.  Further, Robinson avoids the consequences of the logic reached by the Nazi terrorists, who believe that when they cause America and Russia to destroy one another in nuclear war, a resurgent regime of national socialism will take root in Germany to control what is left of the world.  Unfortunately, neither director Robinson nor these Nazi wannabes have remembered that the thousands of nuclear devices that will surely be used in any massive exchange of weapons of mass destruction must surely prove as harmful to the world at large as it would to the two combatants.  Yet it is to Affleck's credit that his youthful earnestness and good looks that he can divert attention from those shortcomings to a more conventional thriller in which a ticking clock is the antagonist.  The explosion itself lasts but a few seconds nor does the film focus on its after effects.  What the movie does accomplish is to get the viewer involved in the improbable trail of clues that leads Affleck to the terrorists who have convinced the presidents of both the United States and Russia that each is plotting the destruction of the other.  The movie shows the inner workings of advisors of both countries.  It is not surprising that the American and Russian military leaders are far more alike in a sense of misplaced macho than they are in anything else.  Both the American president and his Russian counterpart see an escalating series of confrontations as no more than a game of chicken played out on an international stage, with each daring the other to knock off a chip from their shoulders. By the close of the credits, the audience is left with the uncomfortable feeling that if all that stands between mutually assured nuclear annihilation and world continuity is the grit of such youngsters as Jack Ryan, then the inner message of the film becomes clear enough: if world leaders have to choose between fear and calculation as the basis for planning escalated responses to external aggression, then both leaders had better develop a healthy sense of fear of the consequences that cool calculation might otherwise entail.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Playful Mobster Comedy and Cool Dialogue"></head><body><p>Pulp Fiction is inspired by the old novels of the same name.  The characters in the movie remind you of the 1930's -40's cheap crime novels full of familiar characters like boxers willing to throw a fight, mob bosses, calculating wives and bank robbers like Bonnie and Clyde. Tarantino is the director and must have tongue in cheek throughout!<br /><br />Pulp Fiction is set in Hollywood in the 1990's and combines three stories that focus on two characters.  The first story is about Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). Jules quotes Ezekiel 25:17 to his victims before blasting them.  Jules and Vincent are two hit men that work for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames).  Marsellus has a beautiful wife, Mia (Uma Thurman).  Marsellus wants Vincent to entertain his wife and takes her out to a 1950's themed restaurant.  She takes a liking to Vincent, and is also a drug addict.  She overdoses and the scrambling and the scenes scrambling saving her from death are hilarious.  The second story is about a boxer who is asked to throw a fight (Bruce Willis) by the big boss Marsellus.  He decides to make money himself by doing the opposite and wins the fight, killing his opponent in an early round.  The third story is about a pair of lovers (Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth) who discuss a career change from robbing banks to holding up a diner.  They decide a diner is easier and more money.<br /><br />There is also an interesting character named Wolf (Keitel).  He is a mobster cleanup man who instructs on how to do the job.<br /><br />The film's stories weave in and out, there is a lot of dialogue that is mesmerizing.  Talk about Big Mac's in Paris and why someone was killed because he massaged the feet of big boss's wife, Mia.  Sometimes the dialogue goes so long you know it is on purpose - like a rhythmic "riff" to the ears -  The movie is original and bright though the theme is dark in the noir way.<br /><br />There are lengthy scenes presented out of sequence.  I don't know how the movie is held together unless the a feeling of the playfulness of the actors as they enjoy their characters.<br /><br />The final scene brings the movie together - ties it in a neat little package.</p></body></html>

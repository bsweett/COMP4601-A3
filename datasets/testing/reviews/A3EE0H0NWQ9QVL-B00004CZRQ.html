Back then, it was a movie event, and news pieces showed that 'The Exorcist' did to post-modern times what 'Dracula' did back during its debut.  Near hysteria came to some, but the masses were at least electrified by what is unabashedly called "the scariest movie of all time".<br /><br />The key element of this hallmark is that 'The Exorcist' is so convincingly real.  Reinventing horror, it relies on revealing the nature of a possessed demon inside of its innocent young host, Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair).  The way the drama unfolds is not unlike an investigation, complete with medical exams, psychiatry, and a police detective.  All of the inquiry gives the whole horror a plausible presentation.  For who would not be struck by the contrast between the skepticism of the modern world--including from Catholic priest, Damien Karras (Jason Miller)--in all its attempts to explain an irrational phenomena?  The demonic revelation sneaks up on its main players as well as the audience with a tension that only increases over time.  Needless to say, it doesn't rely a whole lot on the element of surprise with terrible malevolent beings jumping out at once.  As expertly as the sound and special effects are rendered, there is little for the audience to guess at what times terrible things will happen.  The presence of the demon inside of Regan makes its menace present to the audience as well.  We can feel the full force of the ordeal.<br /><br />'The Exorcist' takes place mainly on the Georgetown campus where Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is lead actress for a film she describes as "Walt Disney meets Ho Chi Min".  She has three helpers, including two German immigrants, and her director, Burke Dennings, provides an important part of the plot's direction.  Her loose connections with the priests at Georgetown provide some needed solidarity.  It is mostly Chris's story, and her struggle to find some solution to her daughter's developing problem, but it is also the story of two priests (including, the exorcist, Fr. Merrin [Max Von Sydow]) whose determination and struggles give more meaning to the main plot and how it remarkably develops.<br /><br />'The Exorcist' was directed skillfully by William Friedkin who has a host of classics under his directing belt, including 'The French Connection'.  Based on William Peter Blatty's modern bestseller and a screenplay adapted by him, 'The Exorcist' is still a masterpiece of modern horror meant to make one look for a reality beyond the senses.<br /><br />(The "version you've never seen before" doesn't do much to help or harm.  A couple of added scenes provide some poignancy; some of it is extraneous, but none of it really ruins the effect.)</p></body></html>

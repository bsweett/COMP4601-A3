Wow, the dialouge seems to be the same word for word and they really stick to the book. Only a few things were left out but nothing real important or anything. Parts of the book make more sense now that i actually saw what was going on at the time.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed the film. Good acting and plot. The guy should have just took the money and hopped a plane but that can't happen in a movie or there wouldn't be one. I only saw this because of English class but i'm glad I did.</p></body></html>

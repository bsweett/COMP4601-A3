But after having picked up the DVD release the second it was released, and then tried to rewatch it all the way through, I realized it was a smoke screen:  Volume 2 is better than the first, but it's still deeply flawed and not even close to the lasting impact of Reservoir Dogs, or even Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />There are moments of greatness:  Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver is on fire, playing the gleeful, deliberate evil of the character to perfection as she gives what may be the greatest Tarantino monologue since Samuel L. Jackson's "the weak and the shepherd" speech in Pulp Fiction.  Tarantino deserves marks for seeing the sleazy charm in Hannah.  David Carradine is perfection as Bill, stunningly charismatic, although without giving any spoilers, I should warn you that you won't get to see him fight very much.  You can tell Tarantino got a kick out of having Gordon Liu play the white-browed mystic Pai Mei, and Tarantino chose a great child actress for the crucial role of "BB", Perla Haney-Jardine, who becomes probably the youngest actor ever to nail that eccentric Tarantino tone.<br /><br />The problems?  Episodic plotting, cheesy touches, overlong scenes and a howlingly dissatisfying climax.  Neither Kill Bill film had a satisfying narrative, concentrating on filmmaking virtuosity and great shots rather than cohesive storytelling, and while the greatest scenes still pop out at you, they don't add up to a journey you'd want to revisit over and over.  And in Kill Bill, Vol. 2, you have to wade through a lot of crap to get to the good stuff:  The Mexico sequence is excruciating, featuring a pimp character, Esteban Vihaio, whom nobody cares about, played by an actor, Michael Parks, whom Tarantino just loves for no reason.  (Parks also played the dropdead boring sheriff in the first Kill Bill.)<br /><br />Perhaps he was embarrassed for the overload of gore in the first Kill Bill, because Tarantino piled on the sugar in the last act of this film and mired his own film in unnecessary, cheesy sentiment.  "AKA Black Mamba, AKA Mommy"?  Give me a break!  Also, the relationship between The Bride and BB works just fine without the lovey-dovey last scene, which seems to serve no narrative function.  Or, maybe this last scene is doomed because the climactic showdown right before it is non-existent.  You don't set up a great character like Bill and have him go down in a whimper.  Tarantino has done this kind of ending before in Pulp Fiction, where the focus is on dialogue and acting rather than physical confrontation, but here, he's working within the confines and expectations of a martial-arts film.  No martial-arts film, even a Quentin Tarantino one, should leave the audience hanging by giving a dizzyingly unsatisfying 20-second climactic showdown.  If Tarantino had nixed that useless Esteban Vihaio sequence, he could have bought himself eight, 10 minutes to actually work out Bill and The Bride's final confrontation.<br /><br />I've had this DVD for over two weeks now and put it into my player about a dozen times.  After the first time I tried to rewatch the whole thing (and nearly dozed off), I just started perusing only the best scenes, which at their best are just fantastic:  The Pai Mei training; the superbly funny Elle Driver monologue and the subsequent trailer fight; Bill's pre-climactic scenes with BB and The Bride; and the wonderful, trademark-Tarantino "Lisa Wong's assassin" confrontation scene.  Everything in between, unfortunately, was so dependent on not knowing what's about to happen that when you've seen it once, you will never want to see it again.<br /><br />Is this DVD worth owning?  Yes, just for the delicious highlights -- just watching Daryl Hannah and David Carradine steal the scenes is enough.  But be prepared for an erratic ride that will lose steam as you take it a second or third time, and keep your finger on the chapter-skip button, because at the end of the day, Kill Bill Vol. 2 really is a mix between half a fantastic movie and half a cheesy, overlong dud.</p></body></html>

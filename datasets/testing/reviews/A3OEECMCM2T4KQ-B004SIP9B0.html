<meta name="summary" content="Modernism vs. Tradition & Princess Diana"></head><body><p>This is certainly a magnificent performance from Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. In fact the entire cast, particularly Michael Sheen as Prime Minister, Tony Blair and James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, all did fine performances. Great credit must go to the director, Stephan Frears, as has been mentioned, each well performed scene follow seamlessly and the story itself, screen writer, Peter Morgan managed to capture the feelings of the world at the death of Princess Diana and the apparent lack of compassion from the house of Windsor, specifically Queen Elizabeth.<br /><br />The film also approaches the debated issue whether the Monarchy is an out-dated institution, a thousand year line of monarchs that have ruled Britain and made this little island in the Atlantic, an empire not seen since the height of the Roman Empire. However times change, and since the French Revolution, the concept of Monarchy has been shown to be, at the least, superfluous, not paying tax and living off the people. The Nobility not paying tax was in fact one of the contributing factors in the creation of the French Revolution. If you talk to a social conscious Brit, they are either opposed to the institution and would like to see England become a republic or are true monarchists, conservative and wanting to see the customs and age old traditions continue because they contain values that are relevant even in our so-called modern times. This issue is tastefully explored and leans towards the institution remaining and adapting in our new millennium.<br /><br />We currently live in a world where our deepest fears and private concerns are broadcasted for all to hear and see. It is now fashionable to `wear our hearts on our sleeves' go on a popular talk shows and spill our guts out. This has not always been the case. In an older generation, a truly English attribute, was to not show emotion, keep a stiff upper lip, and carry through any crises with dignity. Queen Elizabeth the II worked as a mechanic during WW II, and was crowned Queen at a young age, and the first prime minister she had to deal with was Winston Churchill. To show `unnecessary' emotion during a time of loss was simply not done, and doing so, showed weakness. This new fashion to display emotion to the masses was beyond the queen's understanding and anathema to everything she represented. The notions of modernism and tradition and our changing sensibilities are the crux of the film.<br /><br />The film's ending gives the audience a clue as to the direction England is heading in terms of tradition and our modern world.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is absolutely Queen Elizabeth the II...almost scary in her portrayal of the monarch...suspending all disbelief, she had me believing she actually was the monarch...Oscar material in the realist sense.<br /><br />Good film.</p></body></html>

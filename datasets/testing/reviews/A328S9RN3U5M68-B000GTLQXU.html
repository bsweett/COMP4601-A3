<meta name="summary" content="The Poseidon Sinks Under Its Own Over-Produced Weight"></head><body><p>Summer pickings for movies this year is amazingly slim, explaining why perhaps more people are being drawn to the DVD release of Wolfgang Peterson's clunker POSEIDON that the quality of the product deserves.  Probably the temptation of the state of the art CGI effects positioned Peterson into 'recreating' the 1972 thriller, but sadly the result is a heavy mess of special effects with little attention paid to the characters who should be 'driving the boat' into a story.<br /><br />After a scant few poorly written minutes that introduce the passengers and crew who are to provide the emotional interest in the story (Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez, Andre Braugher, Kevin Dillon, Jacinda Barrett,  Emmy Rossum,  Mike Vogel, M&iacute;a Maestro, etc - stereotypes all), up comes the 'rogue wave' and the ships turns upside down leaving the remainder of the film focused on how to get out of the trapped bubble.  For about fifteen minutes it works then all becomes redundant and the ending matches the desire of the tired audience - the sinking.<br /><br />Why with so many fine stories to tell and new concepts to explore Hollywood continues to exhume old movies to remake is  a puzzle.  Perhaps that is why the film industry is having tough times these days. A movie for those who love special effects without an interfering story. Grady Harp, August 06</p></body></html>

I like Jennifer Weiner though I haven't read this partiular book- but then I recognized Susannah Grant's name from the fame Erin Brockvich movie and my interest perked up.  Rightly so.  In Her Shoes is a wonderful character study about sisters/ friendship or just plain ole relationships.  They're hard-sometimes impossible and more time than you care to admit you just want to toss your hands up and walk away from them all.  But emotions don't always follow logic and I think the actors as well as the screenwriter successfully gets that point across.  In the begining you will hate Maggie but by the end you will come to understand and perhaps love her-despite the flaws.  Even Rose the martyr has a few cracks in the mirror and her character arch isn't as dynamic as Maggie's but at least she's smiling by the end.</p></body></html>

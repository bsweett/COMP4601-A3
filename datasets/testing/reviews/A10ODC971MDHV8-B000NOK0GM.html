<meta name="summary" content="The Third Man"></head><body><p>One of the all-time great mysteries, the excellence of this production is reflected in the talents of its key contributors: old Mercury Theatre colleagues Welles and Cotten, screenwriter Graham Greene, producers Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick, and director Carol Reed. Together they create an intricate thriller, with corrupted souls inhabiting a decimated city like so many vultures. One of the best uses of music in all film, with Anton Karas's original zither score adding to the bizarre, ominous proceedings.Stunningly shot on location, this is a must.</p></body></html>

It is an illuminating and comprehensive affair that focuses mainly on the detachment of the Royal family in a time of national grieving.  Like many recent pieces of historical fiction, `The Queen,' wisely uses ample footage from real videotape.  Diana's death, Britain's mourning, and newscasts intersperse the drama.  This works well, and, while some of the screenplay is speculative, they nearly get all of it right.  Peter Morgan is a dead ringer as Prime Minister, Blair, and Helen Mirren is more than reminiscent of Elizabeth II.  Their rendering of Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) is a bullseye.  My only complaint is that, although we see plenty of The Queen's underbelly, her hard-boiled shell is mostly glossed over.  Elizabeth II has shown her vulnerability, but she can be much more indomitable than the drama suggests.  Perhaps this is presented because they couldn't go too far with this drama.  They understandably do try to be fair to the current monarch, even though they present her as grieving more over a slain stag than over any endearment to her estranged daughter-in-law's death.  Her grief is at her own perceived tarnished crown.  The funeral for her is a private affair.  And, here, Blair, who was in tune with the people, properly perceived the Royal Family would miss out on an opportunity to heal the nation.  He really has the dilemma, for he must balance the forces of those who wish to keep the Royal Family dignified and those who call to have their monarchy eliminated.  He draws from the sentiment of the people and properly eulogizes Diana's death, but balances becoming a laison for an institution he prudently realizes will never be put to death anytime soon.<br /><br />Besides "great performances" the big draw should be taking in the subplot.  The scenes of Princess Di's private interviews, key scenes in her life, and the aftermath of her death provide the most poignant moments.  This isn't her movie, however, and it should be judged by the terms it was created.  The Queen's perspective brings about its own merits.  For who will not be struck about the state of affairs of England by looking upon the turmoil of the UK's most revered institution when it seems to remain aloof and stoic under the calamity of a competing fallen icon.  Although they prudently only present the suspect aspects that brought Diana's death, the whole picture becomes a fascinating composite of tragedy and regal isolation.</p></body></html>

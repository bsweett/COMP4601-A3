<meta name="summary" content="True Horror; High Suspense"></head><body><p>After watching High Tension, I'm now convinced that America has lost its way in the genre of horror. We just don't make them like those outside our country do. The ones that are getting the most news (The Ring) are remakes of Japanese films. High Tension is a French horror film; it's kind of a mixture of Saw and Jeepers Creepers, only about five times better than both.<br /><br />High Tension (a name that rings so true) is about two girls who suffer through one terrifying night at the behest of a perverted killer. I know, it sounds like one of those "same-old, same-old" kind of horror films, but it isn't. When I watched it I started to believe that the scares came from the steady stream of gore in the film; that went away soon after the cat-and-mouse game began between the killer and the protagonist. Slowly, this movie builds suspense, first by presenting a secluded, no-one-can-hear-you-scream setting, then by presenting an image of horror from the killer himself, then by making it night, and so on. By the end of the movie, if you're not a nail-biter, you'll be one. Plus, the twist in this movie is excellent and, more importantly, convincing, as it slowly builds up to it.<br /><br />Another great thing about this movie is the protagonist herself. She's a strong woman, one who takes only so much before finally fighting back. And fight back she does, or at least she tries to, in a number of ways. She definitely isn't the girl you've seen running in the woods only to trip and fall and be skewered by one of the killer's weapons.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Saw, likes foreign films, or wants to find an escape from horror films produced State-side. This is one the best in years, no matter where High Tension was made.</p></body></html>

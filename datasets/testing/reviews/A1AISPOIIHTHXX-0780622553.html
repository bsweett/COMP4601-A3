<meta name="summary" content="One very overlooked film"></head><body><p>It always happens in cinema: a film comes out that wows critics and audiences love...but it went absolutely nowhere. Which is why it's great that films come out on DVD and you can sort out the good ones from the terrible on your own, without it disappearing a few months into their theater runs. Dark City was one of those films, and although it drew a lot of comparisons to the Matrix, this film actually came out a year earlier since this was 1998 and Matrix was 1999. Oh well, it's a great film anyways and shows The Crow wasn't Alex Proyas' beginner's luck. By the way, fans prefer to turn off the sound during the opening narration so my suggestion is the minute you see Keifer Sutherland's character on screen, turn it back on.<br /><br />John Murdoch wakes up in a bathtub, confused and disoriented. In his apartment is the body of a dead hooker with odd looking wounds on her chest. To make matters worse, he's being chased by guys in black coats known as the Strangers. I don't want to spoil the rest (because that opening narration would do it for me anyway) but it's a great film with some familiar scenes with a unique twist, including one twist late in the film that caught me off guard.<br /><br />The film is very much inspired by film noir as probably 97% at least is entirely at night or in poorly-lit buildings. It's a really cool looking film, including one scene where we have a chase while the city goes through a little change. Chase scenes have been done before but this at least makes it unique. It's obvious this is done by the director of the Crow and that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />The special effects, such as Roger Ebert's slightly I'm-so-movie-savvy commentary says, is it's actually about the story and it's not just a case of "look what we can do" which was a problem I had with films like the Star Wars prequels and the 2 Matrix sequels. It's funny how he says there's a charm to effects that look slightly obvious which to me is the opposite: it takes me out of the movie when I notice bad compositing or unfinished looking textures (I'm looking at you King Kong).<br /><br />I would very much recommend this film but like I said, skip the opening narration with the sound off until someone appears on screen, it'll make it much better.</p></body></html>

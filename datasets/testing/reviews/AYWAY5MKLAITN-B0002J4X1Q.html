At first I thought that they would base is on the acclaimed capcom resident evil. Thought that they would base it on the frist game in the series. If you really wanna know where it fits in the series, it's sort of like a prequel to the events that unfolded. The mansion in the movie is not the one in the game. It takes place at a different mansion but takes place during the first game. This movie left me shocked most of the time what with the countless surprises and consistant 'have to hurry' flow. It's the perfect begining to kick off the series. The only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is becuase the zombie effects could've been a littl better. But, other than that, that's all. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

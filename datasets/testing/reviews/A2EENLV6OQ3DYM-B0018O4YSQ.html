<meta name="summary" content="A cerebral Matrix"></head><body><p>&quot;Dark City&quot; is the intellectual sibling of the action oriented &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  The film deals with similar subject matter (just what IS reality, anyway?) and has an even gloomier visual style than  &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  There the similarity ends as &quot;Dark City&quot;  explores the darkest depths of the imagination.  The visuals are stunning,  the acting is superb (biggest revelation, Kiefer Sutherlan CAN act) and the  ending is quite satisfying.  This is a sci-fi film for those who spend  their time reading serious sci-fi novels rather than &quot;Star Wars&quot;  serials.</p></body></html>

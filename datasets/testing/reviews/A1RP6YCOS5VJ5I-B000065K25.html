<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie, Good DVD"></head><body><p>Being a masterpiece of the 90s, Reservoir Dogs is a movie I never get tired of seeing. It has everything that makes for a great guy flick. It has action, an intriguing story and tons of bad language. One thing that sets this movie apart from other movies is that they show that these robbers are more than criminals who care about no one or no thing, but these guys are strong like brothers and actual friends, which ultimately leads to their downfall. The acting in the film is just what I like. Tim Roth does excellent as Mr. Orange, and you really believe he is in pain the entire time. Steve Buscemi is the sarcastic Mr. Pink that provides a little of the comic relief of the film, even though he is being serious the entire time. It is just the personality of these characters that makes this film go by quickly and make everyone who watches this movie wish that it went on for another thirty minutes at least! For a debut film from an unknown director at the time, Quentin Tarantino does a remarkable job in front of and behind the camera; it is easy to see that he was going to be big.<br /><br />The box itself is something any collector would want, it looks and feels like a gas can which is a reference to the scene when Mr. Blonde tortures the cop. The top comes off easy to reveal the real DVD case which is made to look like a match book. The special features are a hit and miss, which kind of dragged this DVD to four stars instead of five. There are great things on this disc that are great, such as the stories told about Lawrence Tierney, but a couple of other extras on the DVD are sub-par. Such as the tipping guide, which is nothing more than a page that tells how a few characters would tip, depending on the amount of money. No videos, no sound, it is nothing that needed to be included.<br /><br />The deleted scenes and interviews with QT, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are great things that I'm glad where added to the DVD. Then there are interviews that have nothing to do with the movie Reservoir Dogs. There are also no behind-the-scenes documentaries or nothing in detailed is said about the movie itself. Everything said about the movie is either about how it was received or what impact it made in cinema. One of my favorite extras on the DVD is "Profiling the Reservoir Dogs", which a narrator gives a little insight to the past of Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Brown. It is very interesting and informative, but you can't really take it to heart since it feels more like speculation instead of real facts about the characters.<br /><br />Overall, if you love this movie, get this DVD! Like I said, the extras feel like a hit or miss, but it is still worth while because there are a few hours worth of extras-whether they be good or bad.</p></body></html>

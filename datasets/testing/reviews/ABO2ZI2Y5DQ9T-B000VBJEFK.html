<meta name="summary" content="Delightful Film from the Director of "The Iron Giant" and "The Incredibles""></head><body><p>Brad Bird's delightful "Ratatouille" has proven yet again what we already know. That is, you don't need a big name or catchy music to make a great animation. All you need is believable characters you can relate to and an interesting story driven by them even though one of the characters is actually a most incredible creation -- a French gourmet rat named Remy, who goes to Paris and establishes friendship with a shy boy working in the kitchen of a (formerly) five-star restaurant.<br /><br />Brad Bird, who scored a one-two punch by giving us two fantastic animations, anmely "The Iron Giant" and "The Incredibles," has created one of the most charming characters in the movie history in Remy, a rat who loves cooking more than anything. The lovable rat's colorful facial and bodily expressions of emotions are always amusing to see, with dynamic movements that only gifted animators can create. (Look close at the end of the film and its "No motion capture" credit.)<br /><br />Not many words are necessary to describe the pure joy of watching this amazing animation. Enjoy the unpredictable story of Remy's adventures plus colorful world of his kitchen. And the film concludes with a strong statement about critic's role, which is quietly done but most biting.</p></body></html>

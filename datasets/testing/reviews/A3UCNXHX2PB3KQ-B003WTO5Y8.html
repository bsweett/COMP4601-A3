<meta name="summary" content="And the Lambs Clarice?"></head><body><p>The Silence of the Lambs works very effectively as a pshycological thriller that toys with your mind. Granted, its not for all tastes to enjoy, but even if you didn't like this film like I did, its hard not to appreciate the surreal feel that the cast and crew have added to the similar movie Manhunter.<br /><br /> FBI in training officer Clarice Sterling[Jodie Foster] has been assigned by her boss Jack Crawford[Scott Glenn] to interview homicidal cannibal psycho Dr. Hannibal Lecter[Anthony Hopkins]. The leads all give outstanding and realistic performances in an interesting way, so its no wonder why Hopkins and Foster took home Best Actor and Best Actress respectively at the 1992 Oscars.<br /><br /> Lecter you see is a 'former' serial killer, who ate his victims as he graphically states in one now infamous scene. He'll still stop at nothing to get a sick gratification from killing the innocent. He may know more than he's letting on about a dangerous, homoerotic character named Buffalo Bill[Ted Levine] who kills and brutally tortures his victims. Both of the killers in this film give very gritty yet frightenly realistic performances as the film's villians. Its up to Clarice to gain enough of Lecter's trust to help track down the other psycho killer who has now kidnapped a senator's daughter.<br /><br /> This film really does play with your mind, enough so to scare you even. Its not exactly a pleasant movie, dealing with the laws of cannibalism and psychology, but its believeable enough to make you say 'wow!' upon finishing it. Therefore, it should be no wonder as to why it was named best picture 13 years ago. Some may call this another slasher film, but the murders we do see are not the main point. To me this is an effective horror/thriller that still packs a pounding punch today.</p></body></html>

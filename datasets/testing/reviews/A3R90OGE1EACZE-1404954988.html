<meta name="summary" content="Now I know why I don't see Adam Sandler movies"></head><body><p>I thought that this movie would be pretty interesting. The previews for it made it seem like it was funny. I however found it very boring in parts and sort of stupid. The charactors were either over the top or fall asleep dull with very little middle ground. Also the running time was too long, it says it was just a little over 2 hours, but to me it felt like much more.</p></body></html>

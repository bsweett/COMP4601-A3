<meta name="summary" content="Finally an edition worth collecting!"></head><body><p>After years of having the original single disk DVD lying on the shelf, WB finally presents an all new and collectible edition of Tim Burton's classic film "Batman". There is actually not much to say about the film that hasn't been mentioned by other reviewers so I will focus on the DVD features.<br /><br />The Movie<br /><br />The movie is presented in a new digital transfer that looks way better than the original DVD release, the picture quality is greatly improved and the colors look brighter than in the previous edition. The classical battle between Batman and his nemesis the Joker looks and sounds better than ever. Both Keaton and Nicholson's performance make of this film the cult classic it is for many fans.<br /><br />The movie is dubbed in both English and French with Spanish, English and French subtitles.<br /><br />The Special Features<br /><br />The original trailer is included as well as many other documentaries that will be a delight for fans of both the comic and the movie. A new audio commentary by director Tim Burton that (as usual and if you are familiar with his previous commentaries) provides not much of extra or valuable information but is a nice to have. A new documentary entitled "Legends of the dark knight" that takes you through the Batman myth over the seven decades of this character's existence, many people involved with the character are here, from Bob Kane, Dennis O' neil, Alex Ross, Jim Lee and many other artists from the Batman comic book universe. Another documentary is included, "Shadows of the Bat", the whole documentary is divided in several pieces and if you want to watch it or have I completed you will have to buy the complete Batman series, in the first movie you will find parts one trough three.<br /><br />Villains profiles are included as well as the original Prince videos (which by the way were not remastered as the film was but, who cares?). A great added value this edition has is the storyboards of the deleted Robin sequence. It was originally scripted that in a certain part of the film the Graysons would be face to face with the Joker, the complete storyboard sequence is here completely edited with music and dubbed by the actors who made the voices for the animated show from the 90's (Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy). With all these details you can see and imagine how many efforts WB put in the production of this set.<br /><br />A great edition of this classical film finally completed with extras that make it a collector's piece.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Film"></head><body><p>I wasn't the biggest fan of the book but enjoyed The Girl Who Played with Fire much better.  This film starts slowly but had me hooked by the end.  The actors whom I have never heard of before are excellent in their portrayals of the characters.  I highly recommend this film and found it enjoyable by the end.  There is a lot of violence in the middle so hang on, everything ends.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A wonderful film for everyone in the family"></head><body><p>Disney once again reaches into its vaults and dust off one of its classic films to give it a proper remastering treatment. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is Disney's latest film to have received a remastering treatment and is being released as a diamond edition. I could not imagine anything less for Disney's first feature length animated film. I have the 3 disc combo pack which includes the dvd of the film (for those who do not have a blu ray player  like me), disc 2 is the blu-ray version, and disc three is chock full of bonus footage which will really please the younger viewers.<br /><br />I admit I have forgotten when the last time I actually had watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I am more the positive that the last time I saw it was when I was still a little girl. The story of Snow White hiding from her wicked stepmother and living among seven dwarfs is timeless. Even at 35, I am still entertained by the story. The animation is beautiful and vibrant, especially the apple. The sound quality is just as good. I definitely recommend buying the diamond edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I don't think you are too old to watch this timeless classic.</p></body></html>

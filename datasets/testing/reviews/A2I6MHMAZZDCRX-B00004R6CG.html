<meta name="summary" content="This is a Thriller?"></head><body><p>Scottie (James Stewart) is a police officer forced to retire due to injuries and his dizzying fear of heights.  His old friend Gavin (Tom Helmore) needs his services, however.  Gavin's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) appears to be going crazy.  She wanders around town but has no recollection of the events.  What really worries Gavin is that Madeleine is at the same age her great-grandmother committed suicide by jumping to her death.<br /><br />Scottie eventually agrees to the job, but doesn't put much stalk in the theory that Madeleine is possessed.  At least at first he doesn't.  Is she really possessed?  Can Scottie save her life?<br /><br />And does the audience care?  I've only seen a couple Hitchcock flicks, and I was less then impressed with them.  I decided it was time to change that, and started here.  It did nothing to change my mind.<br /><br />The story starts out okay, just moves very slowly.  I was drawn into the early story wondering what was really happening to Madeleine.  That is, when the plot moved forward.  I mean, we get shot after shot of Scottie following Madeleine around San Francisco.  We get it already!<br /><br />But then the second half comes and things go down hill.  It's obvious to us early on what is happening, so we get bored waiting for the characters to catch up.  Meanwhile, the acting gets so bad that it's actually laughable.  And the climax?  There isn't one.  The story ends with a whimper.<br /><br />I'm beginning to see why I haven't seen that many Hitchcock films before.  If this is an example of what I have to look forward to, I won't be watching many more.</p></body></html>

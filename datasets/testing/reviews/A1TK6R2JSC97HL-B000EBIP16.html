<meta name="summary" content="Decent, if risk-shy epic"></head><body><p>(Caveat - none of the contributors to The Rotten Review have actually read any of the original books, so if you're looking for a review that says that Lewis's vision has either been realized or unspeakably violated, look elsewhere.)<br /><br />This first entry of "Narnia" thrusts the Pevensie children into the mystical land where time flows of its own accord, and everybody has something to say regardless of their species.  Dominated by the coldly secular...er...evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton, from "The Deep End"), Narnia is an ice-encrusted realm.  All who yearn for freedom wait for word of Aslan, the Lion-savior of Narnia, and for the prophecy of salvation.  Meanwhile, back in a darker land - called Earth - the Pevensie children have been exiled from their home to escape the "Blitz".  It's 1940, and London is undergoing an epic battle of its own, with nightly raids by German bombers.  Finding a boring refuge in the country home of Professor Kirke, it's only a matter of time before Lucy Pevensie (the youngest and most precocious of the Pevensie kids) finds the old wardrobe that leads to Narnia, and adventure.<br /><br />This was a good, maybe very good movie.  It's not quite great though - the plot twists of CS Lewis have been done-to-death by imitators and little here explores what made them so fresh to begin with.  The Pevensie children are immediately accepted as the "Sons of Adam" and "Daughters of Eve" who will save Narnia with Aslan, luckily with a prophecy, a magic sword, bow & arrow and other mystical forms of moral support.  Clues and other kinds of assistance fall into their lap without the script having to put them through any tests of endurance or pain that might tax them (or shock the flick's target audience).  The movie's emotional climax - the sacrifice of Aslan - comes and goes faster than one of the movie's fleet-footed wolves.  With the possible exception of Lucy, none of the Pevensie's mature into full-blown characters, and too much of the movie is given over to CGI creatures and similar effects.  For kids who feel they missed out not getting into "Lord of the Rings", "Narnia" should be sufficient substitute.</p></body></html>

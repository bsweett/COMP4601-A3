<meta name="summary" content="A Masterpiece, but not Hitchcock's alone"></head><body><p>There's a film critic, David Thompson, who claims that Hitchcock's movies are "shallow."  Although unfair, irrelevant, and short-sighted, it's an argument one could make about the Master's oeuvre-with the exception of "Vertigo," a film that exceeds the control of its director, a movie that bears the stamp of the auteur yet must be judged a deeply resonant, collaborative triumph by three of the screen's indisputable geniuses: Hitch, Bernard Herrmann, and James Stewart.<br /><br />On my third screening of this film, the story of obsession became my own, producing a reeling sensation that has yet to lift.  Compared to "Vertigo," the other films of the so-called Hitchcock great trilogy--"Rear Window" and "Psycho"--indeed do seem shallow.  Prior to this viewing I had listened to Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde" with its thrilling "liebestod"-the moment when the consummation of passion must also be its end because it is a love of love rather than of a person.  Then I began to reflect back on similar stories-Morte Darthur, Troilus and Cressida, Romeo and Juliet, La Belle Dame Sans Merci, Wuthering Heights, The English Patient.  "Vertigo" belongs to the same narrative pattern, perhaps realizing it more compellingly than any other representation.<br /><br />In the moment when Scottie forces Judy to become Madeleine, Herrmann's score recalls Wagner's liebestod, crescendoing to an unforgettable emotional peak, at once riveting and disturbing.  In the same moment that Madeleine has been exhumed from the dead by the obsessive man-child, we see that Judy's desperate attempt to draw Scottie's attention to the "real" Judy is doomed and that Scottie's fixation is beyond cure.  The lost child that won't release Madeleine/Carlotta, the compulsive boy who can not be "taught" to love by either Judy or Midge, the frustrated and pathetic "mother" Midge--all remain forever disfigured by the fantasy constructed by Stewart's obsessive, stubbornly regressive, character.<br /><br />In the film's last scene, Scottie overcomes his vertigo but not the need to avenge himself on the figure who has betrayed him and his boyish fixation. Here Stewart's voice takes on the same feminine register, breaking and cracking, changing timbre, speaking in irregular, breathless meter, that we see in George Bailey's conflicted moment between strangling and loving Mary before giving up his dream in favor of marriage and the savings and loan.  "Vertigo" is the George Bailey who left Bedford Falls, determined to pursue his magnificent obsession and the elusive grail.  It may not be a wonderful life, but it's a life that haunts the moviegoer's consciousness like no other film I've seen.</p></body></html>

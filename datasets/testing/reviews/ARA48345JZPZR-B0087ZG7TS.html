<meta name="summary" content="Getting Back..."></head><body><p>This is a very faithful adaptation of a fine novel, and like the source material it is veddy British at the outset and takes the patience to stay with its story for the ample, though sad, rewards of its outcome.  I haven't seen a better evocation of a literary work in recent memory, and the visual look of the film is marvelous, from the stately English manor, to WWII London to the hell of Dunkirk.<br /><br />This will not be a film for all comers.  As stated, like the book, it takes its time to unfold, and although at its center there is a fervent and desperate passion, overlaying it is all that British propriety.  This is stripped away in layers as we come to know these people and the terrible lies and deceptions that ruin lives begun from a central misperception by a bright prodigy who assumes things beyond her limits to know and brings about tragedy.<br /><br />Worth the going for those willing to wait for clarity amidst a marvelously rendered atmosphere, with fine performances, most notably James McAvoy's Robbie and Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony, within cleverly imagined script and direction.  In the end I found the complex story nicely told, and, finally, a touching and sad tale of tragic error and its aftermath and the final resignation to the only atonement possible.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="See Saw?"></head><body><p>I had a female friend who thought about seeing this movie at a theater near the beach.  The question was should she see Saw by the seashore?<br /><br />Actually, beyond some puns, I'm not positive of the merit of this movie.  It is clever, probably too clever for its own good.  The story focuses on a serial killer who puts his victims in elaborate traps which over a minimal chance of escape.  Two men wake up to find themselves chained in a dingy bathroom in an abandoned building.  The only means of freedom are some rusty hacksaws which are just sharp enough to cut off a bound foot.<br /><br />Through flashback, we are introduced to an obsessed detective who is pursuing this killer.  While bright enough to pick up tiny clues, he is also inept enough to wander into this genius killer's lair without a real plan or backup (beyond a single partner).  This allows the killer to get away and engineer his next trap.<br /><br />Fortunately, there are not very many of these "dumb" moments, and in reality, the biggest problem with the movie is its convoluted nature.  For most of the movie, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not, and knew it would come down to the inevitable final twist, which was neither good nor bad enough to generate any real reaction.<br /><br />One mark of a good movie is when you forget you're watching a movie:  with all the stylized direction and overly clever plotting, it's hard to get that absorbed in this film.  This is an interesting movie and not really a bad one, but it's also imperfect.  It also owes a lot to other movies, especially Seven, and you might be better off seeing those movies.  See Saw?  Some say si; I say you might enjoy it if you're a fan of these types of thrillers, but you might not.  I guess you could say I can't make up my own mind; I keep seesawing on Saw.</p></body></html>

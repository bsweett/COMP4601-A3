Take a movie like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVLBGC">The Lives of Others</a>.  Now, instead of humans running the show, imagine if you will a giant supercomputer that is spying over all the denizens of the United States.  It will do anything to preserve National Security - and what defines National Security is up to its own interpretation.<br /><br />This is an AI film that follows in the footsteps of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0003JAOO0">Colossus - The Forbin Project</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015NORDW">War Games (25th Anniversary Edition)</a>.  As such, it warns of the dangers of becoming too dependent on technology to maintain our way of life.  To complicate matters further, the computer is endowed with the murky & anti-Constitutional power of Dubya's Patriot Act.  That is to say, it feels that it is free to annihilate any person it sees as a threat to National Security.  For this computer, a person's Miranda Rights are about as relevant as piccolos are to a marching band.<br /><br />This is a well done adventure film that doesn't make much sense at first, but makes much more sense as the film moves along.  For people who are die-hard advocates of the Patriot Act, it might (just MIGHT!) make them take pause.</p></body></html>

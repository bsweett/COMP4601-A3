<meta name="summary" content="The Soundtrack Alone Was Worth A Trip To The Theater!"></head><body><p>What I liked most about this film is its intense spirituality, fantastic cinematography,  moving soundtrack and the Tree of Life mythology, which is historically accurate!<br /><br />The film is essentially divided into two stories, one happening in the real world, and the other coming to life though the imagination of the author. I enjoyed the story within a story approach! I also like brave movies, which are surrealistic and leave much to the imagination, like 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br /><br />The cinematography is rich and inventive. I think Salvadore Dali would have greatly enjoyed this film!<br /><br />Oh, and the music still pulsates through my soul! It reaches deep, and I'm adding the soundtrack to my collection. The music is so magnificent, I feel it's the best part of the entire movie! It deserves an Oscar nomination!<br /><br />I was also deeply moved by the Tree of  Life theme that runs through the entire movie. It so enchanted me that I did some research. Not only is The Tree of Life a part of the rich mythology from the Judeo-Christian tradition, it is also a significant aspect of the ancient Mayan culture! I find that absolutely fascinating, so much so, that I purchased an obscure video documentary, (Tree Of Life, Directed by Bruce Lane), through Amazon.com!<br /><br />While it would be very easy to criticize this unique film for it's various shortcomings, I much rather concentrate on its many strengths. This is one of the few movies I have seen this year that actually was exciting, and I want to encourage filmmakers to continue being brave and taking chances! That's what art is all about!</p></body></html>

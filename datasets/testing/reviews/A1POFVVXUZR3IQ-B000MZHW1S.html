<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely riveting!"></head><body><p>This is a movie that will stay with you for a while...the horrors of African civil war, the exploitation and abuse of young preteen boys[turning them into murderers, in the guise of so-called soldiers], the exploitation of the Africans by the Western world [in order to procure valuable diamonds], its all here. What makes this movie so compelling is the wonderful cinematography & excellent acting. We are treated to beautiful scenes of the African coast and countryside, which is then juxtaposed with the violence & bloodshed due to civil strife. Leo Caprio gives one of his [if not THE] best performance of his career...he plays the ruthless White ex-soldier turned diamond smuggler to the hilt, and totally absorbs his role[with a pretty authentic Rhodesian accent to boot]. Djimon Hounsou elicits our sympathy as the fisherman Salomon Vandy who after escaping slavery in the diamond mines, makes it his life mission to find his scattered family. His son falls prey to the militia, and is trained to become a ruthless child soldier...the weakest role in my opinion was that played by Jennifer Connelly...her performance as the journalist Mandy Bowen just didn't elicit much emotion. The storyline though moves along at a frenetic pace, and though the movie is quite long at abt 2.5 hrs, it is nevertheless compelling and keeps one glued to the screen. Definitely worth a watch!</p></body></html>

The opening part of the movie is well done and the scenes when Stark is devloping the final version of the 'Iron' suit are some of the finest use of CGI I've seen. In particular where he was initially testing out its flying ability adjacent to his collection of classic cars. Great scene...<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is excellent in the leading role (reminded me of Al Pacino in fact) and it was great to see Jeff Bridges again. Gywneth Paltrow also gave a good performance.<br /><br />Where the film went downhill was the final 1/4. Much like the ending of the latest Hulk film the final battle was entirely predictable. Once again though there is a lovely cameo role for Stan Lee and the final few moments give us hope that Marvel may be preparing a film based on The Avengers.<br /><br />My review is perhaps a reflection of my age. If this film had been produced when I first read the comics (the 1970's) I would have been blown away by it. Sadly age and a somewhat more cynical view of life means that superheroes are never quite what they were. I still love the comics though!</p></body></html>

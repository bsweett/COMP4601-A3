This says a lot for the writer, directors, actors and others involved.  The film is not as quirky as the Coens' previous work, but then, it's not that kind of tale.  It almost plays out in some ways like a classic Western, but is set in 1980 and does not give us easy resolutions. For this reason, some will complain that the ending isn't satisfying because it does not tie up all loose ends, because the villain walks away, because so many others die even if they were innocent and weren't involved in any crimes.<br />  I found the ending quite refreshing, however.  This is not formula.  This is how things often happen in real life, which is messy and can cause a lot of disillusionment.<br />  This connects to the sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones, who comes to realize that he cannot stop what is going to happen no matter what he does, and that he is no longer able to deal with the modern world, which is very different from the world he grew up in (apparently, everything went down the tubes when people stopped saying "sir" and "ma'am").  That's where the title comes from:  it's not a world that people of his generation can inhabit any longer, and the existential crisis and realization cause him to retire.<br />  On to the performances:  aside from the rock-solid Jones, we have Javier Bardem, the coolly eerie, unblinking psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh, who can kill with an oxygen tank without ever beating people over the head with it, but who tries to keep from stepping in blood.  And there is the superb Josh Brolin as Llewellyn Moss, a man who makes the fatal error of trying to take a large sum of money that he never should have touched in the first place.<br />  The almost complete lack of music during the movie contributes to the creepiness factor as well, as does the desolate yet somehow beautiful landscape.<br />  Look for nominations next year.</p></body></html>

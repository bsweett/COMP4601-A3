<meta name="summary" content="The doors"></head><body><p>At Pixar Animation, the love of detail both seen and unseen is expressed in the company mantra: &quot;We sand the undersides of the drawers.&quot; The fruits of this obsession are on display in the DVD release of &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; the animation blockbuster that examines when bad things happen to things that go bump in the night. <p>The Buena Vista Home Entertainment release sprawls over two discs, with a clear separation of extras for kids (they enter a door marked Monsters) and adults (Humans). The segregation is helpful, but everyone will want to go everywhere anyway. A new &quot;Monster's, Inc.&quot; cartoon (&quot;Mike's New Car&quot;) exclusive to the disc should delight everyone, regardless of age. It includes what could be a dubious first: a cartoon character using a cell phone when trouble strikes. <p>The crush of special features can be a bit much, so the chronically zany folks at Pixar do their best to help along viewers. Clad in Hawaiian shirts and groomed for Disneyland duty, key filmmakers do video intros for many of the extras categories.  Civilians will find the filmmakers' commentary quite a challenge, however. Away from the visual arena, the men of Pixar lose their zip, with the discussion devolving into a survey of the film's problem-solving process. As with many group commentaries, it's hard to tell who is talking -- and when they drift off into a long discussion about the Sock, you probably won't care.<p> &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; looks great, of course. Those lucky enough to first see the film in theaters with digital projection will find the look a bit soft, but the pastels are undeniably beautiful and easy on the eyes. The Dolby Digital EX 5.1 mix sounds solid and focused, with the rear channels used effectively for some dialogue. Voice talents Billy Crystal (the motor-mouthed, one-eyed Mike Wazowski), John Goodman (Sulley) and Jennifer Tilly are seen on the job. One extra, a Sulley and Mike game developed for a Japanese TV show, was &quot;very creepy,&quot; my kid noted.</p></body></html>

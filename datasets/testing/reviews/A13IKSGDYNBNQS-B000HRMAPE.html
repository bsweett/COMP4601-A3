<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Average"></head><body><p>This 3rd instalment of the Mission Impossible films sums up exactly what is wrong with most Hollywood films today.<br /><br />Lets be fair and start with the good points: The stunts and action sequences (particulary on the bridge) are breathtakingly good. The acting from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laurence Fishburns (in a small role) is very good. Cruise and the remainder of the cast are reasonable as well. There is also a lovely cameo role from Simon Pegg which is worth catching as well.<br /><br />However on the downside there is virtually no characterisation. The script is at best average, and did I care in the least about anybody in the film (no). Stunts and explosions are great, but if thats all that the film consists of then you no longer have a film. This isn't quite that bad but if you took that out of this film you would have about 15-20 minutes left at the most.<br /><br />So its worth seeing, there are some great moments, but I'd recommend renting it rather than buying as it really is a typical bloated Hollywood blockbuster.</p></body></html>

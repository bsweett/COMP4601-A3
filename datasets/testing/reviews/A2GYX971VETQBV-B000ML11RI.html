<meta name="summary" content="Finally! - An Absolutely Brilliant Film Noir that Breaks with Tradition"></head><body><p>Stunning.  Simply stunning.  SIN CITY is, by far, one of the coolest action thrillers I have ever seen.  Watching it was like being thrown into the dark graphic novels that comprise Frank Miller's world: gritty, dark, bleak, and hostile.  It must have been a monumental task to film, judging from the featurettes included with the DVD.  The actors had to film almost entirely in front of a green screen, allowing the visual effects team to create the most intricate of backgrounds for each shot.  For my eyes, it is the ultimate noir piece.  Due to the computer backgrounds, there is perfect control over the lighting, black & white textures, etc.  Everything is controlled in this film (visually) right down to the smallest detail.  In turn, I think it is safe to say that Director Robert Rodriguez has done the best job of any director at bringing a comic book to the big screen.  This is not a corny adaptation with little men running around in costumes.  Rather than force the comic book world into the theater, the audience is dropped into that world.  The effect is stunning.<br /><br />Yet, despite the fact that the film is visually stunning, it does not rely solely on its effects to make the film.  The acting is quite good.  The entire group is perfectly cast: they seem ripped right out of the graphic novels.  In particular, Bruce Willis seems particularly suited to his role.  He belongs in this world.  But more so than any other actor, Mickey Rourke takes the cake.  He is a great character to open the movie with given that his performance and makeup job instantly set the tone for the entire film.  I hope to see more films working in this style and you'd better believe that Rourke should be at the top of the casting list next time.<br /><br />Even if you've never heard of Frank Miller or are not a fan of traditional action movies, SIN CITY will knock your socks off.  It is very unique and hopefully we haven't seen the last of its kind.  Of course, take my recommendation with a grain of salt: if you are opposed to graphic violence, you might be offended by the film.  Sin City is not the land of "It's a Small World After All."</p></body></html>

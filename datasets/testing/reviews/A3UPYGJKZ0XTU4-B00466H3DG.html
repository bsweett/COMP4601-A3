<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, Offbeat Take on Relationships and Memories."></head><body><p>"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is Charlie Kaufman's best screenplay to date. His typical self-indulgence is tamed by a tight, disciplined story. The offbeat and unconventional script comments on the value of relationships and painful memories without being weird for its own sake. Michel Gondry's relatively low budget direction is creative, stylized, but not heavy-handed. I think this is Jim Carrey's best dramatic role, as well. Joel (Jim Carrey) has split with Clementine (Kate Winslet), his free-spirited girlfriend of two years. As Valentine's Day approaches, he decides to try to reconcile, but finds to his bewilderment that Clementine doesn't seem to recognize him. She has impulsively had their tempestuous relationship erased from her memory in an effort to put it behind her. Joel tracks down Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkerson), who performed the procedure, and decides in a huff to do the same. But midway through the erasure, Joel changes his mind. He tries desperately to preserve memories of Clementine by hiding her in parts of his brain the procedure may not reach.<br /><br />Considering that the past, present, fantasy, and reality all run together in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless  Mind", it's amazing how coherent this film is. We go backward and forward, in and out of memories, switch between characters and subplots, and I never lost track of what was going on. Nor does the film ever lose its emotional focus. Michel Gondry and the film's editor, Vald&iacute;s &Oacute;skarsd&oacute;ttir, have done some amazing work. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are perfectly suited to their roles. Carrey is low-key, and Winslet takes on the hyperactive, outgoing role that is usually his. Kirsten Dunst does a nice job in a supporting role as Dr. Mierzwiak's enamored secretary. Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are appropriately flakey as his technicians.  "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is one of the best films of 2004, and it deserved better than a tepid reception at the box office. Its brilliant direction, two big stars, and off-the-wall, but ultimately upbeat, script never fail to entertain.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 2 featurettes, an audio commentary by director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, 4 deleted scenes, a music video, and a commercial for Lacuna, Inc., the memory erasure folks. "A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (10 minutes) features interviews with the cast and principle crew in which they talk about their roles in the film. It's not insightful. "A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry" (15 minutes) contains more information about making the film and has some funny moments. The audio commentary isn't bad, but it does have a rambling quality and a lot of lulls. I would have liked more technical information, because the film is so innovative, but there is some discussion of how the film's very long shots were made. The music video is for the song "Light & Day" by Polyphonic Spree. Not a good video. It's too bad that the DVD does not include the theatrical trailer for the film, as it was one of the most creative and effective trailers in my memory. Subtitles are available in French and Spanish, captioning in English. And dubbing is available in French.</p></body></html>

I can't lie because I am a big Will Ferrell fan so I was very hype to see it when it came out so I went right to the theatres. I came out with a lot of anger and all I could say was it was horrible. After seeing it in the theatre for some reason I bought the DVD and now I can't stop watching it. See these types of movies need a tremendous amount of nothing to watch them. What I mean by nothing is you need no intelligence, thinking, or even concentration because everything in Anchorman is easy to get.<br /><br /> It's hilarious but to people that actually watch movies like this or Napoleon Dynamite and every other movie like them while being in a smart mode they fail to see it for what it really is. That's the problem today, people are too concerned with everything but what's actually funny in the films and they get mad at them. You have to be laid back and relaxed for a movie like anchorman and most of all you need a huge goofy sense of humor. I leave you with this advice; movies like this are always better when you have a goofy buddy to watch them with. If you have someone that laughs with you at what would seem to be dumb situations things become a little more worth watching. Anchorman will most likely not be funny the first time you watch it but it will grow on you and get funnier and funnier.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent comedy !"></head><body><p>It was a solid funny movie.There was one scene with a cheetah and the two guys rode it and it just wasn't real looking.Other than that it was a decent comedy.Doogie Houser was in it along with (cameo) Jamie Kennedy.I wouldn't buy it for 20 bucks ,more like a 15 dollar movie.</p></body></html>

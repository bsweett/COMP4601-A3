<meta name="summary" content="One of my Favorite Werewolf Films, Despite the Rating"></head><body><p>The Wolfman is not the film that it could have been. It also was not as bad as people have been making it out to be. After seeing it, I did understand why alot of people hated it so much, and why it took forever to get production done, but I don't completely agree. The director was Joe Johnston, and while he may not be the best of filmmakers, I don't dislike his movies. I actually enjoyed Jurassic Park III, and Jumanji isn't a complete piece of crap either. But The Wolfman, like those two, just seems to have been done in his spare time, rather than his main focus. Even so, he could have done alot worse. Danny Elfman, the genius composer. His music is what really got under my skin and kept me interested in the story, because the cheap scares sure didn't. As odd as it may sound, that is what musical scores are made for. Pay attention next time you watch your favorite movie. Because if your favorite movies did not have the music they have, you would notice something special missing. But back to this movie. It's not the rotten movie that most of the critics on RT have made it out to be. I certainly noticed the flaws, but they did not spoil the experience for me.<br /><br />It is true that the pacing is uneven, like most have said. I could probally count the amount of screen time (in minutes) the actual wolfman got, with my fingers. That would not have been such an issue if the other characters were equally as interesting. Sadly, not even Benicio del Toro was very compelling as the lead Lawrence Talbot. I wanted to feel sorrow for an innocent man that becomes a monster, but del Toro didn't make me. Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving are their usual selves. Very good, and believable. My favorite performance hands down goes to Sir Anthony Hopkins. He was great. In fact, I think his performance is what saves this movie, and makes it a standout in its genre. I haven't been a fan of the horror genre lately, but this movie does stand out. The art design was great as well. The dark old English setting was very effective. And the special effects were on point. Even the bloodshed was great, and I'm not big on gore. Although it doesn't bother me. What this film does have is charisma. Every scene with the wolfman was exciting. Throughout the film I found myself slouching in my seat, even daydreaming a couple times about what they should have done with certain scenarios to make the movie better. But as soon as the slightest sign that the wolfman was on his way emerged, I immediately perked up. And in the end, that is what made this a fresh experience to me. The Wolfman.</p></body></html>

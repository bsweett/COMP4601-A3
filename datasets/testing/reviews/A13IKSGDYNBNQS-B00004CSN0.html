<meta name="summary" content="The best crime movie ever?"></head><body><p>Theres not much I can add to what has already been said. However if by some miracle you've missed this film over the last 12 years then here is a quick overview of one of the best crime movies ever made.<br /><br />Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro star as respectively dedicated cop and master criminal. Pacino as Cop Vincent Hanna is so dedicated that he neglects his family and his 3rd marraige is falling apart. DeNiro as Neil McCauley is a man who is prepared to walk away from any relationship in order to maintain his criminal lifestyle. A previous reviewer gave the acting honours to Pacino, which I'd have to disagree with. Lets be clear here both are excellent, and I like both actors, they are amongst the best ever. But for my money DeNiro steals it in perhaps his last great performance. Pacino just overplays his part just a little bit, which allows me to give it to DeNiro - but only just.<br /><br />The remainder of the cast are excellent and Michael Mann directs with his usual skill. Some of the action sequences in this film are brilliantly done. I recently saw Mission Impossible III, which has some impressive action sequences in it but they aren't in the same league as the ones in this film. Why? Because Heat does not rely on CGI effects and the camerawork is vastly superior. Furthermore action sequences do not need to contain explosions every 30 seconds to make them work!<br /><br />This is quite a long film at 164mins but you will find that it passes very quickly - always the sigh of a good film.</p></body></html>

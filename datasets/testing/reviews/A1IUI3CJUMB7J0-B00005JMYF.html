<meta name="summary" content="A funny film with great acting"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this film but it dose have amny stupid moments. The movie is funny from start to finish and the story is good and the acting is also good. Ben Stiller dose a great job as Globolgym's manger, Vince Vaughen plays a decent guy who's gym is about to go under. The film is good when you turn your brain off to amny of the stupid moments like the wrench part. Overall it's a funny film to watch and it will make you laugh.</p></body></html>

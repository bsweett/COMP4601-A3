<meta name="summary" content="Interesting"></head><body><p>Even for those who aren't big fans of lesbian films such as myself, one can't deny Charlize Theron credit for her simply brilliant performance as Aileen Wuornos, the prostitute who was tried and executed for her killing spree in Florida.  The film is well directed and has good acting.<br /><br />Subject-matter excluded, the film is a good character study.  By the end of the film, the audience can (if not accept) understand what factors in Aileen Wuornos' horrible life were responsible in turning her into a such a psychotic monster.  Being a low-end call girl walking the streets and the victim of many male creeps and perverts, its somewhat easy to see why she became a lesbian and a killer: not that this is any excuse for what she did.  The film actually wants to show how Wuornos' lover Selby (Christina Ricci) was encouraging her killing spree so that she could keep running from her relatives.  I could've done without the steamy love scenes though.<br /><br />Again, although I hardly even have a modest interest in the gay film genre, this film was well acted and directed.  Charlize Theron truly deserved an Oscar for her role.</p></body></html>

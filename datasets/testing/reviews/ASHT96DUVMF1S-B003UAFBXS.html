<meta name="summary" content="Elvis Old As Dirt But Kickn A"></head><body><p>It's the instant cult classic, a film praised by its strange story and amazing story telling. The film is based on a story by writer Joe R. Lansdale and adapted to screen by director Don Coscarelli.  The main character is played by non other than Evil Dead actor Bruce Campbell and legendary actor Ossie Davis.  Studios ran away from the idea of two old guys in an old folks home fighting an Egyptian Soul Sucker.  Both Campbell's and Davis's agents said it would be a horrible idea to do the film.  Well both the agents and studios were wrong about the film.  Its success takes cult film to a new level.  New York theater lines rapped around entire blocks for its limited release, hard to believe that only 33 prints were originally created.<br /><br />Thanks to this film I got to take a break form the cookie cutter Hollywood factor.  Elvis and JFK fighting a Mummy that sucks souls, that combination makes people turn away.  I say if you are a fan of horror film give it a chance.  Hey if you are a fan of Elvis Bruce Campbell does a really good impersonation.  The movie received a number of awards at lesser known film festival and award ceremonies.  To bad it wasn't given more respect at some larger festival.<br /><br />My reviews do not give away story detail or even summaries but I will say that this is a refreshing movie that brings together what is great in independent film making.  With the  very small budget and favors from some of the most prestigious special effect and custom companies in Hollywood Coscarelli was able to pull off a remarkable film.  How easily he has put to shame movies with ten times the budget or more.  I am completely baffled at how major film companies can trust unknown, director that lack true experience.<br /><br />Well the movie is funny.  Some of the lines caught me off guard.  They contained a dark humor that appealed to my comedy love.  Bruce Campbell is a funny person and no one can doubt that but this role takes his true acting ability coupling it was a perfect role making for one of my favorite movie is the last couple of years.<br /><br />Video<br /><br />Presented in 2.35:1 Widescreen anamorphic  ratio, this print is surprising excellent.  Most independent films will low budget when transferred to DVD give a horrible quality print.  Not with this film.  MGM has taken extreme care to create a DVD that takes advantage of detail, color and black levels.  Some scenes are grainy but most are flawless retaining a great film like quality.  The print does seem to get better as the movie progresses.<br /><br />Audio<br /><br />I think they used the sound field good to give the movie an edge.  There is only a DD 5.1 track on the DVD but it sound really good.  Voice levels are also good without having to play with the volume level like I have found on several DVD purchased recently.  And lastly the music, an original score was created by Brian Tyler.  It is what really brings out the distinct appeal of the film.</p></body></html>

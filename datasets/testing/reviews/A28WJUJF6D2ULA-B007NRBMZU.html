It was nice to see Ashton Kutcher making the leap to the big screen and I give him full credit for putting his all into a difficult role. I liked the idea that by going back in time and trying to make things better, tiny deeds can set off unforeseen changes to everything that might come after. (Ray Bradbury used this theme well in his classic short story A Sound of Thunder.) In The Butterfly Effect, Kutcher's character returns again and again to his own past in order to try to right the wrongs that ruined the lives of a girl he loved, that girl's emotionally-unstable brother, and a third friend, who also goes on to a pathetic future that can be directly traced to the same key moments. The catch is, of course, that with each interference into the timeline, ripple effects occur and while certain areas of the existence of the four might improve, overall there are unacceptable consequences that inspire yet another trip backward. One weakness to this film was that there was little explanation or exploration of exactly how Kutcher's character was undertaking these jaunts into the past. That was left wide open and wasn't covered very well at all. I can respect saying that something "just is" and going on from there, but it still would have been nice had the means of his ability been fleshed out just a bit more. I also wondered why if the flashbacks to childhood were set (as revealed on a tombstone) in 1995, a relatively recent year, the hairstyles and fashions of the kids looked more like they were from the early `80's. Maybe a subtle effort to give the impression of distance between the latter-day events and the tragedies of once upon a time? Overall The Butterfly Effect was neither great science fiction nor a moving love story but it wasn't visual junk food either. I'll give it five stars for intention, three for what this production ultimately pulled off.</p></body></html>

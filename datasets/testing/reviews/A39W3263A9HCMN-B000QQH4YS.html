<meta name="summary" content="ABOUT FRICKIN' TIME!!!!!"></head><body><p>I remember seeing this back in 2005 when I rented the Criterion edition and watched it one night. I loved it so much that I went to buy it and it was out of print! The only DVD at the time was the bare-bones MGM DVD, which had good picture and sound, but no special features, which is COMPLETELY unnaceptable. I did not buy it, and I stand by my decision, because I saw this steelbook 20th Anniversary Edition at HMV the other day, which I bought. I stand by my decision to buy this DVD!<br /><br />This should be the PERMANENT DVD of this classic movie. I am glad I own it, it's the best DVD in my house right now. Disc one has the theatrical cut, and disc two has the uncut version, which is what the Criterion had... except this is better. This one makes it hard to figure what is restored, leaving you to watch the theatrical to find out what was cut. The special features are great, worthy of the price. Great featurettes, and the commentary is damn cool.<br /><br />Finally, this is the DVD that gives Robocop the treatment it deserves. Those who ae hoping to own this classic gem on DVD in it's true and uncut form, buy it now!</p></body></html>

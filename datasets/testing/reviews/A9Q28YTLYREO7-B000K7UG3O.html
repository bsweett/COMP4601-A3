<meta name="summary" content="tired movie with a bunch of cliches"></head><body><p>this film was like a Episode of Sex in the City meets Hitch. there are some aight parts in the film,but on a whole this film was tiring within the first 20-30 minutes. this film never gets off the ground. the humor is just kinda there. no real chemistry on the screen. just a film that takes elements from tv shows&various films&is forgettable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Motion Picture Academy's fantasy on parade"></head><body><p>It's not often a film this close to mediocre gets nominated for Oscar consideration. Most buddy films like this one -- including "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion" and "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" -- are viewed as two and a half star films.<br /><br />This one, for whatever reason, was given far more consideration by the Hollywood establishment and was nominated for an Oscar for best picture. Why would that happen? Most people know the films that are most heavily-promoted get the most nominations, meaning this film must have won the promotion award.<br /><br />Also, this fantasy about two middle aged slackers resonated with the wine-drinking establishment in L.A. and probably seemed to them like some kind of reality. This seems reasonable since the characters they projected -- an actor and failing writer -- are the archtype cliches from New York and Hollywood films. These characters are perhaps more representative of the Hollywood establishment than any other.<br /><br />Whatever the case, there is nothing outstanding in this movie except for one funny scene crashing a car. There were some nice scenes and a couple that were funny, but this is a two and a half star film. It is absurd to think this film so magnificent is ranks in league with the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />Nominating "Sideways" as best film of 2004 says far more about the Motion Picture Academy membership than it does about the quality of this or any other film released in 2004.</p></body></html>

Letterbox has opened this up to a whole new level, and the detailed picture and sound only enhance one movie that was truly made for blu ray; I have seen this dozens of times, but this was like a religious experience in many ways; I heard and saw things I never had before; This was my first blu ray, so I can't imagine how something more recent looks!! It was almost like certain sequences were in 3D; The ballroom and hedge maze sequences were just jaw dropping, and Kubrick's bizarre color schemes suit the incredible picture quality perfectly. The eerie music sounds even more menacing!!! Great extras, too!!! Finally somebody gave this movie the treatment it always deserved!!</p></body></html>

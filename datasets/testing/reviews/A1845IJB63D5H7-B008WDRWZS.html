<meta name="summary" content="Overzealous and intrusive producer, mediocre story and participants"></head><body><p>Werner Herzog's coercive personality contributed to the mediocrity of an already shallow story of a drugged man running away from society, venturing into the emptiness of Alaska's wilderness.<br /><br />The producer impersonates a biologist and imposes his flawed views about animal behavior without any reasonable justification. In one instance, he claims that the face of the bear represents the monumental indifference of nature, in another; he claims that male bears sometimes kill their offsprings in order to terminate the lactation period of their females for the sake of practicing fornication. What a bizarre and distorted contradiction! How would an indifferent animal reason with such purposeful intent? Then he throws that ridiculous advice: "you shouldn't love the bear, you should respect him!!" That is enlightening. The producer's claim that Timothy Treadwell wished to be a bear is also unjustified. The man was simply overcome by the feat of his addiction to drugs and deprived from any wisdom or patience. He sought proximity to the menace of grizzly bears as a jolt to his numb mind. You could easily feel his fear and awe when those animals slowly and calmly approached him. His reactions portray a man frightened to death and expecting sudden ambush at any minute. His lack of inhibition is what drove him to overreach to his death.<br /><br />The producer imposes his conforming rules of not allowing viewers to listen to the last words of a couple killed by bear without weighing the consequences of tampering with a true story. He claims to dignify the right of the dead. Along the same lines, the producer permits lengthy scenes of a deranged man cursing the department of wild life services for setting strict access rules to the protected refuge, then claims that he does not condone such behavior. As if the viewers have to be lectured by Werner Herzog on the etiquette of respecting authority or the right of the dead.<br /><br />The people that appear in the movie representing Tim's friends, parents, acquaintance, the forensic expert, and the producer are total misfits. Tim's friends, aside from being low-livers, did not shed any light on what drove him to run away from society other than his long addiction to drugs and alcohol. The forensic expert did a lousy job as an actor and stayed unduly long time after reading his script. As if the cameraman was not told to move on to the next shot. That expert claims that the remains of Tim and his girl friend were extracted from the dissected guts of the killed bear. Then he goes on to explain how the bear gouged Tim's scalp then turned to his hip. How did he arrive to that conclusion with such skimpy remains? The obnoxious woman who pretends to be the ex-girl friend was put on camera for no obvious reason other than filling long minutes with nonsense.<br /><br />One could easily find much better quality filming in Disney movies, National Geographic documentaries, or the Discovery Channel. I believe that the producer's narcissism led to his exaggeration of his skills and underestimating the intelligence of movie viewers.  Had the producer kept his nose out of the essence of a true story, the movie might have met some success.<br /><br />Mohamed F.

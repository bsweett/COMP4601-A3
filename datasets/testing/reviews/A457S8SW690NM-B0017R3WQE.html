Yeah..now for those of you who'd like that..seeing drug dealers cussing a billion times and killing each other, then check this "classic" out.<br /><br />This movie is a story of drugs and violence. Now add this to that idea. This movie has nonstop violence, blood and guts and the dialogue is very original. It compromises of the F word and forced Cuban accents. What else? There's people selling drugs..using drugs...going crazy because of drugs..everything drugs.<br /><br />Now what about this movie is influential? This movie is so ridiculous that it is incomprehendable on televison. Why? Because all they say in the dialogue is stuff like this:<br /><br />You got the F'in coke, you F'in F'er?<br /><br />No, F you your mother F'er<br /><br />Man, I cut your F'in face up with my F'in chainsaw you F'in piece of F'in s#$%<br /><br />Wow! Now that's some quality dialogue. And the visuals are really great too. You see people getting hacked up by chainsaws and getting blown away by tommyguns and getting high off drugs. This movie isn't influential..oh sure maybe it is to the drug dealers out there but how is it influential to most people? How is it regarded as one of the best movies?<br /><br />This is absurd and seriously ridiculous. The dialogue is pathetic and Al Pacino's great acting skills are smuthered in F words. This movie is so "good" that it got this fancy DVD and is available at every store. Yet a wonderful movie like Malice is literally extinct.<br /><br />So, if you want to be like the rest of the world and watch this movie..then do it..and if you enjoy curse words and drugs and unnecessary violence...then you'll love this. Or if you love GTA and love running in the street hacking off people's arms..then definitely watch this.<br /><br />It's very disturbing that someone would like something like this and also very pathetic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Elektra shortcircuits"></head><body><p>This is the worst superhero film I have ever seen. Remember how promising the character Elektra seemed in Daredevil? Well, forget it. Jennifer Garner is lucky to have survived this boring, illogical mess.  Can someone tell me how Elektra manages to set off a natural gas explosion inside a house without burning the entire house down? And then there is the climactic battle between Elektra and the evil ninja in a room full of flapping sheets to disguise the action or lack thereof. Forget this one. It makes Halle Berry's Catwoman look like Citizen Kane.</p></body></html>

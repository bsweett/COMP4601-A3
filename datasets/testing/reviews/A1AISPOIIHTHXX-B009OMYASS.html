<meta name="summary" content="I am soooo glad this was a free rental"></head><body><p>Certain films just scream a purchase to me, even blind buys. The Fly and Dr Strangelove were pure blind buys and I didn't regret them. Sometimes though a film comes out and you just have to test the waters. Well going to the video store, I found out I got a free rental so I was very curious about Hostel so got that. Well, that saying of "I want those 90 minutes back" certainly applied to me. "Scariest movie in a decade"? Liars.<br /><br />2 Americans and a Icelandic friend are in England backpacking looking for, what else? Women, particularly soon-to-be naked willing women. They overhear a story of a place that has incredibly easy girls who just love American accents. Well getting there, they meet 2 girls and soon they get suckered in to an odd place: people who pay to torture and kill people for a price, and wouldn't you know it? Americans fetch a mighty fine price.<br /><br />Like Land of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, the Saw films and Wolf Creek, the film tries to horrify by showing disgusting images such as severed limbs or any other nasty business. Hostel doesn't delve into it right away but there's still a kind of pointless feel to it all. When the carnage starts happening, I can just imagine the filmmakers going nuts because they just wanted to make a violent movie. Gore can be used in a more artistic fashion such as war films but here it just feels violent just for the sake of it.<br /><br />What piqued my interest was this guy at the college mentioned the film and one of the gory shots and a woman in the class said "every guy his age should see that film". Whether she meant it as "boys will be boys" who will see those nudity/violence filled movies or it shows commentary on a thing apparently guys love to do: go overseas and bed "hot European chicks". To be honest, I never was into that, preferring the romance and chase angle but this is a commentary and it's a well-told one at that, it's just too bad it's on a ridiculous and pointless movie.<br /><br />If you want good horror movies, check out the Exorcist or the Shining or Carrie but if you're into gory stuff, you'll love it. Me? I want my free rental back.</p></body></html>

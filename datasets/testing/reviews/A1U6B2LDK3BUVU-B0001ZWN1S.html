The quality shines through from beginning to end.  The script, the directing and the acting are all outstanding.  Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is the finest work he ever did, and may be the finest work any actor ever did.  He doesn't stand alone.  The rest of the cast is tremendous as well.<br /><br />There is one obvious fault in the movie.  It idealizes the Mafia.  With such a glorious example of a mafia don as Vito Corleone, we are given the impression that the Mafia is made up of brilliant and sensitive heroes, at least in this one character.<br /><br />From the first scene, Connie's wedding, where the don grants justice to Bona Sera for his daughter's vicious assault, the Marlon Brando character stands about as tall as Lincoln.  I really wouldn't expect to find a man that amazing.  I'd expect to find greedy selfish violent men running the Mafia, not wonderful men like Corleone.<br /><br />That's my only criticism.  The story is beautifully crafted.<br /><br />Oh wait, one more criticism.  I think that Michael should have leveled with Kay at the end.  He had ample reason for his decision, and she would have understood and, if not approved, at least considered staying with him through the years.  Cutting her out as he did, with a lie and a dismissal, makes for a neat ending but not, perhaps, the best or even the most realistic ending.</p></body></html>

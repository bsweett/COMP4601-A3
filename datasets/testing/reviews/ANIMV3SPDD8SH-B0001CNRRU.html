<meta name="summary" content="FINE FILM"></head><body><p>Strange tale about interwoven lives surrounding a heart transplant recipient works very well despite a super tragic incident which serves as the movie's centerpiece and garners the audience's attention and sympathy. A woman's family is killed while crossing a street by a drunk driver and she slowly and methodically seeks revenge with the help of her dead husband's heart transplant recipient. Sounds preposterous but it unfolds believably and becomes a genuine think piece that never resorts to heart bludgeoning measures, given the very emotional circumstances involved.</p></body></html>

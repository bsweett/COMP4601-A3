<meta name="summary" content="Another Winner For Disney/Pixar. First Place Again."></head><body><p>Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Cars is another winner for Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios. Since the release of TOY STORY in 1995, they have not disappointed in any of their films (I've yet to see Cars 2, Ratatouille and Brave), except A Bug's Life, infusing their movies with not only top-notch talent, but also great stories with very strong positive messages about friendship and family. And of course, the animation is always stunning.<br /><br />Sadly, this would be Paul Newman's final movie before his death. The legendary actor starred in many films, including The Sting, Exodus, The Color Of Money (for which he won an Academy Award) and Road To Perdition. Good way for a terrific actor to make his final bow.<br /><br />Rated G.</p></body></html>

That was the point.<br /><br />House of 1000 Corpses is a tribute to bad seventies horror films (and a few good ones). This should be obvious by, well, just about everything about it, but still, some folks didn't get it. I don't understand why. It couldn't have been the sets, which echoed everything from early Argento films to Shriek of the Mutilated. It couldn't have been the cast, most of the bad guys from which were in those bad horror films. It couldn't have been the editing (two words: Mario Bava). It couldn't have been the overly garish use of light, a holdover of black-and-white B-movie directors who felt the need to oversaturate everything they touched. It couldn't have been the Saturday night chiller theatre frame the movie has (featuring a cameo from director Rob Zombie). Everything about this movie pointed directly back to almost every horror film made during the seventies. Why were these people expecting an original movie?<br /><br />If you look at it as a bad seventies horror film, it's great mindless fun. In case you missed every horror film made between Last House on the Left and Final Exam, the story involves four teens who make a bad decision to go out looking for a tree where the evil, insane Dr. Satan was hanged many years ago, and suffer a flat (helped along by one of the bad guys, in a scene straight out of Motel Hell), causing them to go to the house of the hitchhiker they picked up (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, though this one's much better looking), whose brother, conveniently, owns a tow truck (Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation). Then, well, things start getting... odd.<br /><br />It's a fun little rollercoaster ride into nostalgia, and worth watching if you have a fondness for movies like The Dead Hate the Living, Galaxy of Terror, Trilogy of Terror, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, or the eighties remake of The Blob (alumni of which all make appearances here). There's even a cameo for Michael J. Pollard, of Fulci's Four of the Apocalypse fame.<br /><br />Don't expect a great movie, and you'll have a good time. ***</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superb sequel!"></head><body><p>six months after the incidents of the first movie, the mutant infected i have died of starvation and the U.S. Military decides to repopulate London where Refugees that have escaped the outbreak return to reclaim their home. a widowed father (Robert Carlyle) is reunited with his son Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and daughter (Imogen Poots), all this seems nice for London's residents but a carrier of the virus soon infects some of the residents and starts to make more zombie-like rage mutants again, can some of the soldiers survive this deadly onslaught?<br /><br />A great and exciting sequel to the excellent 2002 British Sci-fi horror hit that just could be better then the original. Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and producer Danny Boyle have conjour up a sequel with  tons of action and graphic violence & more gore then the original, very nice cinematography, a well written story and of course some social commentary that made Romero's zombie movies such great classics. It's a thrilling and blood curdling apocalyptic scare-feast that is a must see for fans of the original modern classic.<br /><br />This DVD contains cool extras like commentary, deleted scenes with optional commentary, a "Making of" documentary, two featurettes, a 2 part look at the "28 Days Later-The Aftermath" graphic novel and theatrical trailer.</p></body></html>

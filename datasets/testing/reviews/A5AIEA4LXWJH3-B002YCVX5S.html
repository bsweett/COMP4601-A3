<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Video Quality, Great Audio Quality"></head><body><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was very good, but I didn't see it as great.  I thought the video was soft.  I had my TV set to "Vivid", and it still did not look great.  There wasn't any grain, but it just did not look sharp.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was great - lot's of surround sound.<br /><br />I thought the movie was pretty good.  It looked like it was 2.40:1, and lasted about 2 hours and thirty minutes.  There were a lot of sub-titles, and it did not give me enough time to read some of them.  I just don't like having to read the words; it distracts from the movie.</p></body></html>

Moreover, for a commercially done effort this one is not too hagiographic or heavy on the dramatic episodes when they are not called for. The only thing that I would add is something of a historic note. In the year 2008 one could reasonably expect to be nominated for and even to win an Oscar for playing a homosexual, a taboo subject for most of mainstream cinematic history. And that is to the good. What I would note is the distance that has been traveled since the 1984 film documentary "The Times Of Harvey Milk". That film (an Oscar-winner), a more sober retrospective of Harvey Milk, made on a shoestring, played in, at best, art houses. One can argue for the virtues than a wider circulation of well-done commercial has but I will say, after a recent renewed viewing of that documentary, politically and socially it presented a much better picture of the real Harvey Milk and the real struggle for gay rights, including the underestimated backlash then and now.</p></body></html>

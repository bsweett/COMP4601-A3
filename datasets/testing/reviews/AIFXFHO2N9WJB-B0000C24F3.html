Enter relatively new director David Fincher (the third director for the franchise) who had the misfortune of trying to meet the expectations of the fans, but also that of the studio based on the first two films quality and success.  However, success for Fincher and his film "Alien 3" was going to be relatively hard to come by as the studio reportedly tampered repeatedly with the script to where the cast and crew never knew from day to day what the overall story would be for the film.  This no doubt would make for a daunting task for any director, and an extremely uncomfortable and unsettling experience for a newcomer who could possibly destroy a franchise with one stinker of a movie.<br /><br />"Alien 3" finds our tough-as-nails heroine Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash landing on Fiorina 161, a maximum-security prison planet.  Upon recovering from her harrowing experience during the last film, Ripley begins to suspect that there may have been another alien hidden onboard her ship.  Her fears soon become realized when the convicts that populate this dreary planet begin to meet gruesome fates, leaving Ripley with the one option that she knows all to well, face down the creature before it's too late.  As if the alien running loose wasn't enough to contend with Ripley is being plagued by a nightmare that she may have an alien inside of her body, but is it merely her mind playing tricks on her or is it a frightening reality?<br /><br />So after two highly successful entries under this franchise's belt, would "Alien 3"  be another terrific installment and make itself yet another success story for the executives at Fox to boast about or would it be devastating blow to a franchises future possibilities?  The answer, much to the dismay of director David Fincher (though not really to his surprise), "Alien 3" proved to be the least successful entry in the franchise and one that makes the audience wonder if this is a series that has already reached its peak potential.<br /><br />The story was an interesting one, and full of potential if handled properly; however, the reported tinkering by the studio (a concept that is hardly foreign in Hollywood) would cause this film to fall flat on its face in a heaping pile of unused potential and disappointment.  There are some neat elements to the story, the cameo appearance of Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and the final scene with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley coming to a shocking conclusion as to what she must do to save the remaining convicts of the planet are the biggest highlights of the film.  In the director's defense, he did film some other exciting scenes that did make it into a type of director's cut that was released to DVD, and the scenes though not all finished show how much better the film could have been if Fincher had been given a proper chance to make it right.<br /><br />The cast of the film, led once again by Sigourney Weaver (who seemed a bit bored in this installment), was relatively strong.  Though one does miss the energy of Bill Paxton and the intensity of Michael Biehn, but Lance Henriksen's appearance does help the proceedings.  The special effects were good, though not heavily relied upon, it appeared that Fincher was attempting to go for atmosphere much like Ridley Scott did with the original film; sadly the sets used to create the prison were too much alike and the shadows caused the audience (being me) to be confused as to what the difference was between different locations.  Leaving me to wonder at times which characters were where and who exactly was in danger of becoming the latest prey for the alien.<br /><br />The movie could have been another great entry into the franchise, but studio tinkering and too much confusion led to "Alien 3" not quite living up to the expectations of the fans and a less successful stint at the box office.<br /><br />"Alien 3" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

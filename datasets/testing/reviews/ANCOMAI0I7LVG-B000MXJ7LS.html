<meta name="summary" content="Come to the light my twin..."></head><body><p>Okay, so here is another review dedicated to my Ammy twin, Mr. Know it All.  You knew this one was coming though.  I'd get into the whole `United 93 is a masterpiece and you really need to revisit that' but you can read my comments on you review of this train-wreck to know my stance on that.<br /><br />To be honest, I already wrote a review for this film a while back, but I have since switched personas here and thus have the opportunity to write a new one, just for you!<br /><br />Okay, so I'll get the obvious out of the way.  I just don't `get' Nicolas Cage.  Yes, he has moments of brilliance (`Leaving Las Vegas' & `Adaptation') and he even has moments of greatness (`Matchstick Men') but overall he is an emotionless mess who doesn't seem to understand how to emote anything other than a blank stare.  He's, in a word, ridiculous.  So, walking in I wasn't expecting much from him, so I can't say that his stagnant performance shocked me, since it didn't.  Michael Pena is an actor I am not really familiar with.  In fact, outside of this I'm really only familiar with his work in `Crash'.  For being such a retched film, `Crash' at least toted some memorable performances and, for me, Pena was one of the standouts (better than Dillon and far more deserving of an Oscar nomination).  Sadly, I think my expectations got the better of me for he was rather dull here.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt and blame it mostly on the script, which didn't give him much too really do.  In a few scenes (mostly when accompanied by Gyllenhaal) he actually makes an impact, so I see that his talent is still in tact.  Sadly, this film is beneath him.<br /><br />So, with two poor performances stuck in the middle of this film, it's kind of off to a bad start for me.<br /><br />As mediocre as Cage and Pena were though, this film is destroyed by Stone's direction.  It is just so stagnant of emotional impact.  The film really just meanders around, proving to be a wasted opportunity.  9/11 was such a tragic time and it still lingers as a haunting reminder of the fragility of peace.  That said, so many claimed that 2006 was just too soon to make so many films about the disaster.  I don't agree with that at all.  If the films had been done properly (ala `United 93') then we wouldn't have been attacking them as a nation.  `World Trade Center' serves as a valiant effort gone terribly wrong.  Stone is never one to back away from controversy, but this film seems so tame for him.  It doesn't challenge the audience at all.  He is a director that I am constantly on the fence with BECAUSE of his controversial visions, but at least when he challenges me I can admire his ambition.  This film is just lazy.  It doesn't go anywhere, and the stale performances he drew out of the two leads only serves to water down the emotional impact a film like this should carry.<br /><br />But alas, there is always Gyllenhaal and her BRILLIANT performance as the emotionally conflicted wife of Pena's character to help ease the pain of this poorly constructed drama.  The way she embraced her character's struggle without ever once playing to the clich&eacute;s surrounding her `stock character' is completely commendable.  Every moment feels very, very real (from her gut wrenching agony to the playful way she teases her husband).<br /><br />In the end, my friend, I urge you to take a second look at this film as well as `United 93' (I know, it's painful) and reconsider your rankings.  Taste is taste, and I'm not here to belittle yours, but we are supposed to be twins and so you kind of have to agree with me!</p></body></html>

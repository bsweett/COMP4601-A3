<meta name="summary" content="A Wonderful Satire!"></head><body><p>A dark comedy that pokes fun at the tobacco, gun and liquor industries. Specifically it focuses on the career of Nick Naylor. Naylor, played by Aaron Eckhart, is a single father who loves his job. He is a tobacco lobbyist slash "spin doctor" and his whole job is to make tobacco and cigarettes look good enough that people will buy them or at least not stop buying them.<br /><br />Eckhart delivers one laugh after another and keeps the film moving and entertaining. He also proves that anyone with the right charisma (and a good smile) can get away with anything. One of the funny things about this film is that there is virtually no smoking in the film.<br /><br />There are lots of guest appearances by actors such as Katie Holmes, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot, Robert Duvall, Maria Bello, Adam Brody and many more that add to the entertainment value of the film. I think smokers and non-smokers will get a kick out of this political satire.<br /><br />Feature wise, there are a bunch of deleted scenes, the usually "commentary" options, an interview segment with the author, director and star of the film from Charlie Rose, and two documentaries on comedy.

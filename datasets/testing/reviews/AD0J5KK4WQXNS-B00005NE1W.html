<meta name="summary" content="Night's most original work to date remains ambiguous."></head><body><p>M. Night Shyamalan has done three mainstream films. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; which is a rehash of a twist that we have seen before. &quot;Signs&quot; which is a homage to B-Movie films and &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. Unbreakable is Night's most original piece but actually has no meaning and there is nothing to take away from this one at all. However there is plenty you can BRING to it because of the nostalgia of Superhero movies of the past. Night does all of that here in a modern day reworking of these themes which is played out with a hint of realism. This sort of gives it more appeal and makes it less fantastic and thus closer to reality. I will not tell you the plot or anything about it because it will ruin it for you. When released the film was based on a &quot;man&quot; who is the &quot;soul-survivor&quot; of a &quot;trainwreck&quot;. There was no mention of Superheros when this film was released. <p>Now that it is tagged with that in the product description I think it is safe to say that this is a movie about a Superhero coming to terms with his own powers in the modern world. It is a good flick and well worth watching if you like the nostalgia of this theme. The film does work. The final twist does say ... &quot;Unbreakable 2&quot; but it is more or less there just to play with us a little and broaded the scope of the superhero theme. It is an interesting gimmick more than a plot twist here.</p></body></html>

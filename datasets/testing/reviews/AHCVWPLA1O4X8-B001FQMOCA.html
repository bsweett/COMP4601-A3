<meta name="summary" content="Good profile of the legendary singer"></head><body><p>The most striking thing about this movie, and something that has been widely mentioned with good reason, are the spectacular performances of the movie's lead characters, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  Their acting is tremendous, but as Johnny Cash and June Carter they do their own singing as well, and pull it off remarkably well.  I believe Cash's voice to be inimitable, but Phoenix makes a very good attempt.<br /><br />Most of the movie's entertainment value comes from the music--the singing throughout is certainly the highlight.  The movie dragged a bit for me at times, but for the most part flowed fairly well, and some of the most interesting events in Cash's life (his introduction to Folsom while in the Air Force, touring with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and others, etc) are chronicled well.  Johnny's pill-popping addiction seemed a bit drawn out to me, however.  Despite this fact, however, this was a very entertaining movie and certainly worthwhile.</p></body></html>

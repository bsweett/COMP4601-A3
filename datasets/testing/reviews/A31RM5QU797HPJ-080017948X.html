He is self-centered and doesn't much like Groundhog Day.  He goes through the first time being nasty and downright rude to everybody.  He goes to sleep, glad that the day is over.......or is it?<br />  He awakes to find that its Groundhog Day again and the same things happen also, people say the same things, nothing ever changes except Phill Conners.  He kills himself serveal times and different ways, but he can't escape from the time warp. It's always Groundhog Day.<br />  Finally, he does things right: he helps people, save a kid's life (the kid had never thanked him), saved Buster from choking on a steak and be all round nice guy and bingo, he's out of the time warp.  One of the best romantic comedies out there.</p></body></html>

This is how I saw the transition of Steve Rogers (a very small skinny guy) into Captain America - a fairly large muscular guy. Obviously a lot of computer work went on here. Although all very well done, there was still something slightly disturbing about this transition.<br /><br />The anomaly that sort of diminished this movie is that it is set in the 1940s, yet the technology seems to be on-par, or exceeds what we have today - ray guns that can vaporize an entire human in a single shot. This begs the question, why more like Captain America were not made, and how come over a period of 70 years we have not been able to perfect and replicate this kind of technology.<br /><br />Putting aside these issues... The acting and the movie as a whole is entertaining. Hugo Weaving puts on an excellent performance as the bad guy. Another weird thing about this movie was the idea of the US Army using their most combat ready soldier for musicals and cheap entertainment. Very strange ... but I suppose they had to have some filler to make up the time, so that it would be a full movie.</p></body></html>

I thought that it would be a good concept to combine Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman.  I didn't really expect a deep story line and the best acting.  I was expecting a lot of action and something to keep me entertained for two hours and change, and thats what I got with Van Helsing.<p>The story is about Van Helsing (Jackman) getting sent to Transylvannia to kill Dracula.  Why he was all of a sudden sent there now is a mystery, since Dracula has existed for 400 years.  Dracula wants to use Frankenstein's Monster in order to give his children enough power to survive and continue to have vampires exist.  Anna Valerious (Beckinsale) is trying to kill Dracula in order to fulfill her family's destiny.  These are the main plot points of this movie.  <p>Hugh Jackman plays Gabriel Van Helsing, a man who is "employed" by the Vatican to stop evil doers.  He is a very religious man, whom is in a constant inner struggle about if what he is doing (killing people) is righteous.  Jackman does a good job for what he was given.  I really hope that he excells as a big action star, but this role reminds me a lot of his Wolverine character from the X-Men series.  Kate Beckinsale is alright in the movie, mainly a pleasure to look at.  Dracula really annoyed me throughout the movie, along with Frankenstein's monster.  <p>The best part of this movie was clearly the action scenes, and believe me, there were a lot of them.  This movie did not really have too many boring parts.  I don't like how every action scene was CGI and no stunt men doing what they do best.  I guess I'm kinda old school and occasionally like to see stunt men doing the stunts, instead of a computer animation.  Van Helsing is not a bad movie.  I wouldn't say that its a good movie either.  Its more good than it is bad.  Its basically an action movie that keeps you entertained throughout the movie.</p></body></html>

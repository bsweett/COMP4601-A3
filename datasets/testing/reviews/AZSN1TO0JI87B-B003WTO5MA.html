<meta name="summary" content="Yet Another Horror Remake -- But Boy, This One Needed It!"></head><body><p>Let's face it: The original "Amityville Horror," released in 1979, is horribly dated. Unlike other horror movies at the time, this movie just hasn't held up very well. Not to mention, the onslaught of sequels which, while they were entertaining, were never much for scares or originality. I had always thought in the back of my mind, when movies like "Dawn Of The Dead" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" were being remade, why not "The Amityville Horror?" If any horror franchise needs to be renovated, surely it is this creaky old James Brolin flick. Now don't get me wrong; I'm an "Amityville" fan. I love all the great horror movies from way back, but there is just so much to be improved on. But I digress.<br /><br />The new "Amityville Horror" is brought to you by the Platinum Dunes production company (spearheaded by blockbuster director-turned-producer Michael Bay), who also put out 2003's most excellent "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." If you are familiar with that remake, you can pretty much imagine what they did with this one, which is why I dragged myself into the theater to see it. The scares are definitely up quite a bit from the original, and it moves at a much faster pace too. Ryan Reynolds (who you may remember from movies such as "Van Wilder" and "Blade: Trinity," but whom I would rather remember from "Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle" instead) takes his most serious role, as the nice-guy, step-father who buys the troubled house on Ocean Avenue. It's such a steal too, because at the price he is offered, he can start a new life with his new wife and three troubled kids (whose father is deceased). However, nothing is free in this world, and the dream is too good to be true. Little do they know, until it is too late, that a man murdered his entire family in cold blood just one year prior. It turns out this beautiful house just may be possessed by demons, and turns the man of the house into a cruel psychopath who tries to kill the family and their beloved dog. It's more or less the same deal as the original movie. Although not being a complete remake, it does stay true to the source material while adding new elements that make this easily the best film in the "Amityville" franchise to date. It's not really a horror movie, more of a suspense/drama. If you're expecting extreme scares, this might not do it for you. But it is a nice distraction for 90 minutes and is very well made, with newcomer director Andrew Douglas pulling all the right strings. My only gripe with this movie is the ending. True, it doesn't have to be a splatterfest, but it didn't really grab me like it should of and I feel let off the hook too easy. But regardless, I still recommend any horror fan go see it. It's not without it's flaws, but it sure beats the unimaginitve "PG-13" horrors that we have been bombarded with for the past few years.</p></body></html>

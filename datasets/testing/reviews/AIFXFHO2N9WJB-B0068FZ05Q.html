<meta name="summary" content="Who Is Jason Bourne..."></head><body><p>Spy movies never cease to do big business at the box office, but sometimes spy movies seem like they are all the same which doesn't necessarily affect the box office, but it does affect DVD sales.  There are several highly successful spy movies that have figured out how to keep things fresh for audiences; such as, James Bond, Spy Game, Mission: Impossible.  When it came time for the release of yet another spy movie, this time based on a classic Robert Ludlum novel, people were excited, that is until it was discovered that this adaptation would not have much in common with the source material, then skepticism set in.  However, unlike most cases where a movie tries to be as different from the book as possible this one works and was hugely successful, wowing audiences from day one.<br /><br />"The Bourne Identity", based on the first book in the "Jason Bourne Trilogy" by Robert Ludlum, is about a man who is found in the ocean and has apparently been shot and doesn't remember who or what he is and who or what did this to him.  Now this man must embark on a quest to not only discover who he is, but what he is.  He has martial arts abilities, highly aware of his environment, and is constantly haunted by memories that don't make sense.  Now, the people he worked for at the CIA believe he went rogue, and want to bring him in for questioning or silence him for good.  But upon discovering his name is Jason Bourne, and that he is now wanted by the very people he worked for, though he doesn't remember why, Jason is going to take the fight to the CIA and clear his name once and for all.<br /><br />Superbly crafted thrill ride that never lets up until the credits roll.  Though it is drastically different from the novel it is based upon, "The Bourne Identity" still retains the spirit of the novel and sets itself apart in a way that doesn't alienate fans of the novels, but also doesn't require you to have read any of them either.  Excellent cast that is lead by Matt Damon, in a role that no one thought would fit him, but he proves otherwise.  Perfect direction from director Doug Liman (director of Mr. & Mrs. Smith).  "The Bourne Identity" is an excellent, intense spy thriller, that sets the bar for all other spy movies even higher.<br /><br />"The Bourne Identity" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.</p></body></html>

You look in awe at the ideas the film has and how it executes them. I admired it more than I liked it for it's skillfull blend of dark humor,  originality and sweetness. It's daredevil fun, but it has the potential for  more. Though I enjoyed and do recommend it, I sort of expected more from a  movie about going into someone else's head. A tour of Malkovich's mind  would have been more entertaining than just looking out through his eyes  sockets. Still, it's a fun movie and sometimes thrilling in it's own  special way. &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is in a sense, some sort of  achievement. None of it seems barrowed, it all seems fresh and new. All the  actors are great. If only a little more had been added, if it had dared  more, than it would have been a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

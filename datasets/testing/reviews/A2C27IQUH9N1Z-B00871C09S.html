<meta name="summary" content="The DVD is a wonderful item for those who love this film"></head><body><p>I was prepared to dote on this DVD since Rear Window is my favorite Hitchcock film, but it was even better than I had anticipated.  The film has been restored (by the same marvelous team who restored Vertigo), and it looks wonderful.  The images are sharp, the color glorious.<p>Also included on the DVD: &quot;'Rear Window' Ethics&quot;, a documentary about the film's restoration (complete with interviews with crew, cast members (such as Miss Torso) and Pat Hitchcock O'Connell, Alfred's daughter); an interview with screenwriter John Michael Hayes; production photographs and notes; trailers.  There is also supposedly access to the original script, but I have not yet been able to access this running the DVD on a Mac.<p>Options include running the film in French and the availability of Spanish or English subtitles.  Widescreen format.<p>One thing I am missing: I believe there is a version of the film with closing credits seen as the blinds in Jeffries' apartment lower, mirroring their being raised during the opening credits, but this ending doesn't seem to be here.<p>You cannot go wrong with this exciting DVD edition of one of the greatest films of all time.</p></body></html>

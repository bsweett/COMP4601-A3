Films have undergone evolutionary strides, and it's usually the rich studio heads that have damaged the industry. Radio, too, is not what it once was, though Mr. Keillor has always been a charming draw. A sad, fond farewell to the wonderful media that once were is the focus of Mr. Altman's "simple" film. I've read the other reviews, and I'm sorry that so many people just don't "get it". Mr. Keillor's radio programs, rife with wit and humor, are simple and straightforward. Mr. Altman gave Mr. Keillor this very respect by keeping the film simple, though the man, despite his years, is gleefully putting together another crazy exposition of the human condition, with the deviously humorous help of Mr. Keillor himself. What's not to love? The cast is stellar, and I was particularly amused at the scenes between Kevin Kline & Maya Rudolph. Kline's name was Noir; backstage intrigue, and an endless reference to life as it ought to be...well, I was moved and entertained.  This is NOT a simple film. Traces of "Nashville" (music), "Cookie's Fortune" (grisly humor) and "Gosford Park" (a narrow set), reminded me that Mr. Altman knows how to take a new and fresh approach to his material. I can't wait til his next film project.  UPDATE: I'm glad to have the DVD in my collection. Mr. Altman will be sorely missed. Other director's will make ensemble films, but Mr. Altman is the creator of that genre, and I hope people don't forget.</p></body></html>

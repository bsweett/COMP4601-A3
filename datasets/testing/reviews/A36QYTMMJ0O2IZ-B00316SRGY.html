His kids make attempts (albeit poor ones), his self-involved granddaughter, and even a 27-year-old "virgin" Catholic priest.  It seems that the only person who had any kind of deep connection with him, was his wife.  Any of us who have never been involved in a war, couldn't possibly understand what it does to a person.  It becomes clear that Walt is carrying tremendous guilt about the things he's done in the Korean War.  He can't let it go.  He buries himself in his anger and contempt for nearly everyone else, especially including a Hmong family who has moved in next door.<br /><br />Right from the get-go, it's clear that Walt can't stand them.  They remind him too much of the people he fought against in Korea.  Walt is so used to insulting nearly everyone he meets, that it's practically second nature to him.  It's his defense mechanism, so that he can never have to have a deep connection with anyone.  The only people who can stand him are a couple of drinking buddies at a bar, the town barber, and the town construction supervisor.<br /><br />One night, Thao, the young son of the Hmong family, is pressured by a Hmong gang to attempt to steal Walt's car (the 1972 Gran Torino) as part of a gang initiation.  Walt catches him in the act, which only seems to cement his hatred of them.  When Thao resists doing anything else for the gang, he is threatened by them, and lo and behold, his "savior" happens to be Walt holding an old-style rifle used in the Korea War.  Walt, of course, couldn't care less about Thao, but simply wants them all off his lawn.  Little does Walt realize, that this simple act of protection has opened a door, he never sees.<br /><br />Sue is Thao's older sister.  It's clear that she likes Walt, despite his offensive remarks.  Through Sue, Walt begins to find a connection with the Hmong.  "I have more in common with these people than I do my own family!" he quips.  He's invited to a Hmong gathering, and strange enough to Walt, he's enjoying himself.  Thao is forced to do odd-jobs for Walt to pay off his debt for his attempt to steal Walt's car.  This gives Walt yet another connection...ironically enough to the boy who attempted to steal his car.  Walt sees that Thao isn't like the kids in the Hmong gang, but that this boy actually has a chance to do something with his life.  Walt realizes that this probably won't happen as long as the Hmong gang continues to terrorize Thao and his family.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is arguably one of the best directors in the business.  Some people have complained about the acting of the Hmong cast.  I didn't have a problem with it.  They aren't professional actors, and that is okay.  Instead, it's as if they are simply playing themselves.  Their lines almost seem improvisational and not from a script.  For this film, it works well.  I was especially impressed by young Ahney Her (Sue).  I felt that she wonderfully created the bridge between Sue and Walt.  She's tough, and yet kind and sensitive.  That is a pretty good balance to achieve for a first-time actress.<br /><br />Walt Kowalski is carrying a heavy burden of guilt.  The priest attempts to help Walt, but as Walt explains to him, "You know nothing about life and death, kid."  The priest realizes that Walt is correct.  The priest has never been in a war, nor has ever been asked to take a life because it was his job; and to learn to hate a group of people to help you perform that job.  Like a poison, the anger and guilt is eating Walt up.  Despite what Walt says to the contrary, it's evident that Walt loves Sue and Thao as if they were his own kids.  He helps them, looks after them, and protects them from something he never wants them to ever have to be a part of.<br /><br />Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's last acting job, and boy, does he end his illustrious career with an incredible film.  It's about the power of redemption; about finding a way of excising yourself of the demons that nearly everyone carries; and how holding on to that guilt, eats you up like a cancer.  Some scenes are difficult to watch, and strangely enough, we get used to Walt's constant racial slurs.  I think the reason for this is, that to most of the audience who knows and understands Walt Kowalski, he doesn't really mean it.  He simply doesn't know any other way to communicate.<br /><br />Gran Torino may not seem like a masterpiece, but is really comes close.  For Eastwood's final curtain call, Gran Torino has a lot of power in its message, and many may well view it as a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

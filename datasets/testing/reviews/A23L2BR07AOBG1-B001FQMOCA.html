<meta name="summary" content="To all those believe this film is a great biopic....."></head><body><p>you're sadly mistaken and duped. Oh, why don't I like this film, it's  because what happens is a train wreck and without the energy and emotion to make it palpable.  I respect both of the actors and the director as well as Cash and his wife, but this film makes the worst compromises. It sacrifices genuine moments of joy in his life for muted paraphrases of them. Film is an emotional medium in terms of storytelling and you can't tell a biopic with it. Often biopics are inaccurate because of this and it seems this one has the reverse problem, they made a dull movie because they didn't want to be accused of sensationalism. That "d word" in the last sentence sums up this movie just fine. It's dull from start to finish, it never takes off and it finishes in a way that makes even the biggest supporter of it think "that's it"  or even possibly "well, it had to end sometime" or even ludicrously, "I thought they were going to cover the later years when he did that cover of "hurt"." I can't think of one reason for this movie even existing except for the fact they were cashing in on the bandwagon of people who became fans when the media made a deserved tribute to him when he died. It's possibly and even likely that Cash's life is worthy of dramatization, but what's shown here isn't worth the trouble.  It's not terrible because of the performances, but the performances feel like composites instead of authentic portrayals. I hated that and also hated the fact that I knew there were better actors for these roles as well as better stories to tell. They just seem depressed and without energy throughout. Just to state the obvious: this film is a downer even if the ending is somewhat victorious.</p></body></html>

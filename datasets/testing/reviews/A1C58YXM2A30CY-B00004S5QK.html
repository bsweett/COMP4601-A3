<meta name="summary" content="This is Real Entertainment!"></head><body><p>[Review of the single disc edition, rented from Netflix.  The DVD had commentary by Liza Minelli and a few trailers from some of Fred Astaire's great films.  There's a scene selector but not much more than that.  No real special features or "making of" that usually make these DVDs fun to pore through.  Still, a fun film that you don't want to miss.  Broadway musicals are not filmed much anymore, staying with stage presentations.  In Fred's day, they filmed them as well to large, responsive audiences.]<br /><br />First Impressions:<br /><br />This was a fairly impressive film.  If you really like musicals and lots of schmaltzy dialogue, this may be for you.  For me I felt the storyline a bit too much and way too many musical numbers for me, but that's just me.<br /><br />Fred plays Tony, a washed up song & dance man who tries to make a comeback.  He hooks up with some friends who are scriptwriters, but unfortunately they deal with a prima donna director who changes it all and is so demanding and so annoying that Tony walks out.<br /><br />The other star is Cyd Charrisse, whose elegant ballet legs and sexy demeanor really make the film for me.  Too bad that the films of the day dubbed in other singers when she opens her mouth.  Was her singing really that bad?<br /><br />There are some scenes where the dubbing is off.  The director is not moving his lips yet you hear "Tremendous, stupendous...etc."<br /><br />Memorable Moments:  When Fred and Cyd dance.  She does not have the staccato style of tap that I have seen with Fred and Powell and she does not have that smooth sexy elegance of Ginger Rogers.  What she does have is an athletic ability and choreography with Fred to make it happen.  For me, there just was not enough emotional chemistry during the dancing.  "Dancing in the Dark" was my favorite of the numbers.<br /><br />Plot, Etc.:<br /><br />"Bandwagon" is the name of the Broadway play and when they change it to what they really want it to be, the play becomes a hit.  Most of the film shows scenes from the play that are really excuses to show off the singing and dancing.  Great work, you can really see the actors enjoying themselves.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Though somewhat schmaltzy, "Bandwagon" is worth a watch for Fred and Cyd, as well as the big hit of the day, "That's Entertainment!"  Nowadays, you get these musicals straight from the Broadway stage.  In the 50s, the film versions were top notch.

<meta name="summary" content="A return to form for Wes Craven"></head><body><p>The last few times we've seen the words "directed by Wes Craven" on anything, it hasn't really been anything to write home about.  From the Scream trilogy to the debacle that was Cursed, it seemed like Craven had lost his edge.  The man who brought us terrifying, exploitation films like Last House on the Left and the Hills Have Eyes, along with the classic Nightmare on Elm Street, may not go for the throat like he used to, but Red Eye is as close a return to form for the director that we'll get for a while.  Hottie Rachel McAdams stars as a hotel manager catching the red eye flight back home, and soon enough she turns the tables on the psychopath (Cillian Murphy, more menacing and eerie looking than in Batman Begins if you can believe that) looking to assassinate her father (Brian Cox).  There's really nothing we haven't seen before in Red Eye, but under Craven's guiding hand the tension and suspense are superbly crafted.  McAdams and Murphy are quite good as well, and the film is short but sweet, clocking in at under an hour and a half.  All in all, there may well be hope yet for Craven's future films, and anyone looking for some great suspense should definitely check this out.</p></body></html>

After more than three decades Ridley Scott returns to the franchise that established a new watershed mark for sci-fi horror. That's plenty of time to stew things over for a sequel. But while PROMETHEUS does address a few questions, it frustratingly raises even more. Case in point, the mystery of the Space Jockey figure. Still, I appreciate that the narrative doesn't spoonfeed you the answers.<br /><br />In 2093 the deep space vessel Prometheus, spurred by a clue 35,000 years old, journeys to a distant and inhospitable moon in search of mankind's origins. Prometheus is manned by a crew of seventeen, many of them anonymous cannon fodder. On the barren moon a scouting team eyes a vast, unnatural construct and explores it. Inside they find air that is breathable... and the remains of an ancient alien civilization.<br /><br />Prepare to be gobsmacked by the eloquence and scope of Ridley's storytelling. The set designs are magnificently realized and, gratifyingly, still very much influenced by H.R. Giger's ominous surrealism. For those who may get their Scotts and Camerons confused, PROMETHEUS is more reminiscent of ALIEN in its slow burn evocation of atmosphere and tone. The tone itself is contemplative. There's an exploration into the metaphysical stuff, into the relationship between science and religion. The story takes its time but builds to a blistering crescendo. The spooky bits are parceled out in measured doses; Scott once more prefers to let your imagination do the work. Honestly, the film is heavy on mood but light on terror. It does eventually unleash several nice scares, and ****REST-OF-SENTENCE SPOILER NOW**** particularly one harrowing moment involving a cringe-inducing bout of self-surgery.<br /><br />Next to THE AVENGERS and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, PROMETHEUS is this summer's most anticipated film. Which leaves it vulnerable for a letdown, expectations being so high. Those going in the theater salivating for a comprehensive backstory will probably exit grumbling. There is a connective tissue, but Ridley Scott doesn't confine himself to the ALIEN mythos and with crossing t's and dotting i's. He expands on it, paints a bigger canvas. He introduces even more concepts. He lays in the puzzle of the Space Jockeys, who we learn are genetic engineers who may have created humanity. We're left questioning their motivations with regards to the human race.<br /><br />The film gives us expert direction, staggering visual effects, marvelous acting. Noomi Rapace's archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw emerges as our point-of-view character. She starts out as this sort of sweet, unprepossesing scientist willing to be coddled by her more adventurous scientist partner. In time, when it all turns to sh--, we see her channel the strength and awesome kickassery of Sigourney Weaver (although Rapace doesn't quite match Weaver's thunder). A deliciously creepy Michael Fassbender plays David, the android whose motivations seem mercurial and ever suspect. The excellent Idris Elba, as the laid back ship's captain, provides a dash of levity and a much needed human touch. And stepping in the shady Paul Reiser "company man" role, Charlize Theron is so icy and impassive that debate immediately surfaces regarding her true nature. Is she or isn't she? What she is, is underused.<br /><br />I rate PROMETHEUS 3.5 out of 5 stars. The stuff I liked, I liked very much. But the flaws... aaaiiyeeee! Or is that perceived flaws? I'm a bit torn about something. I refer to Ridley Scott's measure of ambiguity and his reluctance to produce those big reveals, to provide an even more pronounced connective tissue to ALIEN. One thought is that he's holding out for a sequel, in which case I'm on board. There's something to be said for slow burn gratification. But other elements undermine the film. Bits of metaphysical exposition come off as heavyhanded. I hate that a sizable chunk of the narrative stems from the scientists' making so many poor choices. Personnel eschew proper protocol. They throw caution to the winds and discard their oxygen helmets. They abandon their observation posts for a quickie while other crewmen are stranded off the ship. They think menacing tentacles emerging from inky pools are cute and harmless. I won't even go into Guy Pearce's unconvincing old man make-up. These nitpicks wouldn't be as readily apparent were this film not a furtherance of the classic ALIEN mythology. You can probably brush them off on BATTLESHIP or the TRANSFORMERS sequels. But there's a level of intelligence attached to this franchise that is compromised here. So, to sum it up, PROMETHEUS is a dazzling, powerful visual feast and thought-provoking enough, and it does give you moments in which you make those instant connections. Its grand scope absolutely begs for a viewing in the movie theater (you can probably give the 3-D a pass). I wouldn't mind seeing the survivor(s) in a follow-up picture. I wish it were better.</p></body></html>

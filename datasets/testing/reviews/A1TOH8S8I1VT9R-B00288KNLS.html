<meta name="summary" content="Another Stop-motion Dandy!"></head><body><p>As a big fan of stop-motion animation (using physical objects), any time a stop-motion film gets wide distribution I celebrate.  Simply put, stop-motion animation is my favorite film making medium.  I did it as a kid and I appreciate its unique place in the world of film art today.  Unlike 2d cell animation (Disney style), 3d stop-motion animation seams to be finding a place in the computer driven world of feature films.  Though not specifically advancing the art of stop-motion animation, Coraline dutifully keeps it alive for all the right reasons.<br /><br />WARNING: RISK OF SEVERE GEEK JUICING BEYOND THIS POINT!!!  PLEASE WEAR EYE PROTECTION!!<br /><br />STOP-MOTION = CREEPY<br />If you want a fantasy to be creepy, inject a little stop-motion and you will be successful.  If you look back at prominent films that employ Stop-motion it becomes clear: Corps Bride, Nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, Wallace and Gromit, the Curse of the Were Rabbit, Chicken Run and everything Ray Harryhausen did.  Stop-motion usually equates to creepy or fantastic.  Most fans of the technique would agree that it's the slightly jerky and awkward movements that contribute to the surreal and eerie feel that is so effective in these films.  "Coraline" is a very creepy film and even more so for employing stop-motion.<br /><br />TAKING A STEP BACK FROM "CORPSE BRIDE"<br />In my humble opinion "Corpse Bride" was the best feature film done entirely in stop-motion.  As the first film to use digital still cameras to animate 3d objects, "Corpse Bride" set the standard for character expression, meaningful movement and Stop-motion artistry.  "Coraline" takes a slight step back from "Corpse Bride" in its animation technique.  Things don't move quite as smoothly.  Characters don't have the same sense of weight or expressiveness.  All of that aside, "Coraline" is still an excellent piece of art and I enjoyed watching it despite not meeting "Corpse Bride" standards.<br /><br />MOVING A STEP AHEAD OF "CORPSE BIRDE"<br />Where "Coraline" advances the art of film making may not be in stop motion particularly, but rather in its hybrid technique use.  "Coraline" may well be the first film to combine stop-motion with CGI and very effectively in my opinion.  Many people revile CGI due to over-reliance on it by many in the film industry.  Very often films start to look like video games.  In "Coraline" CGI is used strictly as a background device.  Some might call this "cheating", but I can't imagine how this film could be achieved as effectively without it.  As much as I love stop-motion, CGI has its place and this was a creative place to use it.<br /><br />ACTORS WHO DON'T SING<br />"Coraline" is unique for a stop-motion film in that there are no extraneous musical numbers in the place of conversation.  That does not mean there is no music at all, it just means that the music occurs when it might in reality:  While someone plays the piano, in a theater, and at the Circus.  I was taken aback when the characters broke out in song during "Corpse Bride".  I never expected it and it took a couple of viewings to get used to it.  In Coraline the music was natural and unobtrusive.  Though I've never heard Dakota Fanning (Coraline) or Teri Hatcher (Mom 1 and Mom 2) sing, I'm not disappointed I haven't yet.  They both did excellent work here with Hatcher being the surprise of the day.  She personally made the "Stepford Wives" look downright inviting.  I don't want to take the time to talk about all the actors, though I should mention all involved make significant contributions.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT THE STORY "GEEK-MIAS"?<br />I enjoyed the story quite a bit.  The question is, will you?  Here's how my family received this film.<br />WIFE:  she doesn't like being reminded of her own mortality, so she was not too thrilled with a story that has dead children in it.  She thought the movie was ok but didn't like the subject matter.<br />SON:  as a sensitive 6 year old, he was somewhat frightened by it.  He liked the format and the fantasy, but was less than thrilled with the bugs and scary stuff, same as my wife.<br />DAUGHTER:  She liked it.  As a 10 year old, she related a lot to Coraline because she's close to the same age and has awful parents just like Coraline... ...wait, did I say that?  Regardless, I've raised her to enjoy scary stuff so she was with it.  She thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />ME:  I love stop-motion and the story was original enough to keep me guessing.  There were dead children, so peril was well established.  There are plenty of quirky (crazy) characters and plenty of creepy stuff too, so I was well satisfied.<br />THE 4 YEAR OLD SITTING NEXT TO ME:  "Mommy, I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN!!"  I guess she didn't like it.  That warmed my heart.<br /><br />LIKE THE CHILDREN OF "HAMLIN", I'M HOOKED<br />Though not reaching the heights that "Corpse Bride" did, "Coraline" immediately went on my DVD wish-list after leaving the theater.  Seeing it in 3D was really not important and actually a distraction.  Seeing it without the glasses is fine.  The story is dark like many fairy tales and harkens back to the "Pied Piper of Hamlin" which creeped me out as a kid, so your kids might be a little disturbed.  For fans of stop-motion, it's a reason to smile.<br /><br />-Story...............4 Stars<br />-Animation..........4.5 Stars<br />-Characters..........4.5 Stars<br />-Family Appeal...3 Stars<br /><br />Total.....3.87 Stars</p></body></html>

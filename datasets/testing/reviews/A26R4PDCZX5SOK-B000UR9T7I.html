<meta name="summary" content="The most complex of the Spidey movies"></head><body><p>4 of 5 stars for the comic book based movie Spider-Man 3. Of the three Spider-Man movies, this is the most complex with the deepest focus on the main characters. Tobey Maguire & Kristen Dunst return in the key roles. The overall plot is about a strange black creature arrives on the Earth and ultimately bonds with Peter Parker making a "black Spider-man". There are several sub-plots in the movie which add to the complexity of the story. There is Harry the son of the bad guy from Spider-Man 2 who first wants revenge for the death of his father, then loses his memory and ultimately things work out OK. There is the "SandMan" who was the guy who really killed Parker's father; able to shift any/all of his body to sand he is difficult to fight. And then there is the engagement of Parker and MJ; well maybe.<br /><br />As with all of the other Spider-Man movies, this one is extremely well made with good story, good characters and good action. Good special effects. The only reason for not giving a 5 star is the complexity of the plot which doesn't seem to flow well.</p></body></html>

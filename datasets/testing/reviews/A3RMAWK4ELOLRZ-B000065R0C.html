<meta name="summary" content="Run Lola Run"></head><body><p>Lola receives a frantic phone call from her boyfriend Manni who lost a small fortune.  Now it's up to Lola to retrieve the money somehow.<br /><br />A fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat adventure; "Run Lola Run" is like Viagra for the eyeballs.

<meta name="summary" content="A Multi-Dimensional Enigma"></head><body><p>This film was ranked highest when the American Film Institute announced its list of "America's Greatest Movies," followed by Casablanca, The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia which complete the top five. It has been 62 years since its release and yet it remains one of the most interesting, indeed compelling films ever made. It was directed by Orson Welles who also plays the lead role of Charles Foster Kane. William Randolph Hearst presumably served as the model for Kane. (I have no interest in getting into all that now. Others have already discussed quite thoroughly the film's historical context and have much of value to say about it. The comments which follow are limited entirely to the film itself.) Perhaps only directors and cinematographers can fully appreciate Welles' technical achievements in this film. Even 62 years later, I am still fascinated by the analysis of Kane personality, especially as it is revealed in his relationships with various associates over several decades. His intelligence is formidable, his charm almost irresistible and yet....<br /><br />Most of us have an indelible childhood memory or association. For Kane, it is "Rosebud," the last word he spoke before dying. Those who view this film accompany reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) as he seeks to understand the meaning of Kane's last word. We learn that  Kane  was relinquished as a child by his parents (Agnes Moorehead and Harry Shannon) after he becomes the heir to a substantial fortune; his conflicts with his guardian, Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris); his impetuous decision to run a newspaper with the help of schoolmate Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and loyal assistant Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane) because it would be "fun"; his emergence from scandal sheet publisher to the owner of America's largest and most influential newspaper chain; his marriage to socially prominent Emily Norton (Ruth Warrick), whose uncle is the President of the United States; then Kane's bid for public office which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore); Kane's futile attempts to promote his second wife as an opera star; and his final, self-imposed exile to a massive but incomplete palace called "Xanadu."<br /><br />Thompson conscientiously attempts to reconstruct Kane's life as best he can but even so, there are so many unanswered questions as the film ends. What does Kane make of his childhood? When was he happiest? Why embarrass and abandon Emily, a decent and devoted wife? Why did he decide to spend what remained of his life with Susan Alexander? As he lay dying, did he feel that his life (everything considered) was a success? I have thought about these and other questions a great deal and am dissatisfied with my responses to them. No doubt that explains why this film continues to attract and then frustrate me...and perhaps others. There are other questions which I would have asked of Welles, especially during his final years.<br /><br />Perhaps (just perhaps) the answers to all of the questions which could be asked of Kane and of the man who created and then portrayed him cannot be answered. And perhaps (just perhaps) that is why this film continues to attract and then frustrate efforts such as mine and others to explain it. So I guess we must cherish its art and accept its ambiguities, just as ultimately we must accept the basic ambiguity of what it means to be a complicated human being.</p></body></html>

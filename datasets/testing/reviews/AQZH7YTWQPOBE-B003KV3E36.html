<meta name="summary" content="It's nice to see somebody take on the Burmese army"></head><body><p>After following the situation in Burma for years, it sure was nice to see somebody take on the Burmese army! Unlike the past movies, this one isn't exactly Rambo versus a huge army - he has help from some mercenaries. Still, they manage to do a good deal of damage. If only they could do that in real life. This is really the only movie since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN7T">Beyond Rangoon</a> that features Burma, so it's a must-see for anyone interested in the country.<br /><br />This is definitely the best Rambo film since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a>. However, it doesn't really have any character development or raw emotional value - just lots of shooting and violence. Of course, that's what a Rambo movie is based on. Nonetheless, the lack of a deep emotional connection to the movie (of the type in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a>) means this film only gets three stars. After seeing it once, it doesn't really have much replay value.</p></body></html>

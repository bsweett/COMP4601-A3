<meta name="summary" content="Unique cultural twist on an action film"></head><body><p>'Apocalypto' starts out with a peaceful setting.  Men from an isolated tribe are out on a hunt, bantering with each other as they track and kill their game.  One character that stands out is Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), an elder and father to young Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood).  Their peaceful, homey village is shattered early the next morning when raiders arrive, to burn, pillage, and destroy the village while taking captives.<br /><br />Young Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son down a deep sink-hole before battling and succumbing to the raiders.  Men and women alike are strapped to poles and herded through the jungle like livestock, into the vast Mayan city.  Along the way a young girl shouts out prophesies to the raiders, of a dark day and a jaguar.<br /><br />The city is truly a cinematograph wonder.  There are scenes depicting the slaves that built the Mayan pyramids, slave markets, merchants, vendors, and of course the high religious pyramid where the rulers lounge in luxury watching the sacrifices to the Gods.  Jaguar Paw escapes becoming a sacrifice by a solar eclipse.  But the Mayans still intend to make sport of him and his fellow villagers.  When Jaguar Paw manages to escape, the movie gives a chase scene not soon to be forgotten.  Jaguar Paw needs to make it back to his wife and son before the rains start, and with a pack of raiders on his tail, the going is tough.<br /><br />Many other movies are bloodier while depicting less implied violence.  The violence implied in 'Apocalypto' by the Mayan ceremonies is brutal.  There are a couple of 'dig the heart out of the chest' scenes, plus one Tarantino-Style blood spurting scene, but overall the gore was controlled in measure to the violence.  Also, many modern movies employ chase scene just as intense as Jaguar Paw's flight from the raiders, but the atmosphere of Mayan culture and the primitive weapons and fighting techniques make this chase scene unique.<br /><br />The photography is stunning, and the actors, while unknowns, are remarkable.  The entire movie is spoken in Mayan and subtitled in English (you can also choose French or Spanish), but even if you aren't fond of subtitles you should still check out the movie, the action outweighs the dialogue.  This is a visually beautiful movie with plenty of plot and action, though the plot is an old one the presentation is new.  A solid 4.5 stars.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

After seeing "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Iron Monkey", both incredible movies, I've realized that this genre has some really excellent work and now this movie, starring Jet Li, can be added to the list.  Though "Crouching Tiger" is still my favorite, this film is completely amazing and has some of the most beautiful imagery I've seen on film.  Whether it be a "shower of arrows" or golden leaves whirling around two fighters, this movie uses small things and turns them into a complete treasure for the eye.  Even color is used like a secondary character in this film.  I think this is one of the most stylized films I have seen in the last few years and Hollywood should take note.<br /><br />Jet Li was really good---this is the first film I've seen him in.  After seeing "Hero", I'll have to check out some of his other work in Chinese cinema.  Maggie Cheung is a beautiful actress and I hope to see more of her.  The rest of the cast do nicely in their roles, a couple of them also cast members from "Crouching Tiger".<br /><br />If for nothing else, you'll enjoy the look of this film.  But luckily for the viewer, there is more than that---a good story, great fighting sequences, a passionate love story.  A good movie that offers a little bit of everything to please everyone.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

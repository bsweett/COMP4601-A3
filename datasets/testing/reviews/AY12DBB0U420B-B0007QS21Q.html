<meta name="summary" content="An Interesting Futuristic Tale. Clever, Well-done Robots."></head><body><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "I, Robot" staring Will Smith. It was an interesting DVD. The movie was a futuristic tale, but only going ahead to the year 2035 so a lot of Chicago (the movie site) and it's people looked very much like today. A really big difference was the appearance and abundance of human-like robots who performed many, if not most, of the ordinary tasks of day to day life. This was a clever part of the movie, and the robots were very well done. These things looked like humans, talked like humans and moved like humans, but they were clearly not humans dressed up in costumes (as in Star Trek, let's say) for the purpose of the movie. What were they? Well, I don't know, but they were fascinating and they were present in great abundance. It's probably some clever computer animation trick, but the trick is very well done and a lot of credit is due.<br /><br />The story itself was not as fresh and new. It introduced the idea of life with robots where Will Smith was a human police detective and was one of the few who had a negative view of robots and their place in human culture. It seems that the robots were programed not to harm humans in any way nor could they be controlled to harm humans. Well, you know this isn't going to last or you wouldn't have much of a movie. Sure enough, a programming change was brought about and the robots began behaving more like humans in the negative sense. Thus began a long drawn out battle between Smith and his human colleagues opposing the human-like robots and their controllers. It involved a lot of action and destruction of anything and everything. The high action level will probably keep you watching carefully. All in all, I found the story to not have a particularly interesting plot and I'd rate it as a three-star movie in that sense. However, the sets and animations and high action are so well done, that I'd give it five stars for that part of the production. Okay, we'll average it out to a four star rating. My hope would be that the clever people who put this thing together will be back with a better plot.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

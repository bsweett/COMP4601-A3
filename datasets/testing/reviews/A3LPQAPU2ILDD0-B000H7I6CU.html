<meta name="summary" content="Pixar. Teaching Good Values."></head><body><p>Pixar and Disney are a wonderful team. After huge successes like "Toy Story" "A Bug's Life" "Toy Story 2" "Monster's Inc." and "Finding Nemo," they come out with another Box Office winner in "Cars." But compared to their previous releases, I rank this latest offering last. It just isn't as well written a story, and I believe most will be disappointed to find very few actual racing scenes. And nowhere near as funny as their previous releases. One highlight though, is the message it brings. A reminder to all of us that, winning is not nearly as important, as how we treat others in the process of achieving our goals. Something every child in the audience needs to hear, and possibly every adult even more so.</p></body></html>

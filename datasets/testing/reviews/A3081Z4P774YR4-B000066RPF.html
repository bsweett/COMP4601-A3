Despite one or two slow periods in the film, this is definitely a comedy you need to have a pulse to get.  The DVD specal edition has it's own little moments of humor as well.  Not only do you have commentaries from the members of Monty Python (above ground, anyway), but even subtitles in Shakespearean form (for the more high-brow types).  The second disc is where you'll find a shrubbery full of features, including sing-alongs and my prsonal favorite in this set, part of the film done with Legos (you know, the blocks you put together to make stuff that you may have played with during your kiddie years)!  For Monty Python fans and fans of insane and confusing comedy, this one's definitely for you.</p></body></html>

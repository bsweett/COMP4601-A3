<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic Footage!!!"></head><body><p>I applaud the brave souls who endured the rages of Antarctica's cold to film this fantastic footage. I know my son learned a lot, and I certainly collected a whole new perspective on Antarctica. It is certainly more than the winter wasteland many tend to visualize. The revelation of dedication to their young, and the role the male takes on to protect the offspring inside the egg, was an event I couldn't even imagine. What these creatures must go through to preserve their species has this viewer's deep appreciation. Think you have a tough life? Try being an Emperor Penguin...<br /><br />Chrissy K.

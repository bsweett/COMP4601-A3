<meta name="summary" content="My expectations were low, but even then."></head><body><p>Indiana Jones movies are supposed to be a little silly. However, this plot with the aliens just drags. The big revelations are lame and the end is silly. Are the extra-dimensional beings good or evil? They help start civilization, but they seem pretty careless about all life when the ship took off.<br /><br />The stunts were a hit and miss. Harrison Ford was great as Indy again. The relationship between Jones and his son was ok. I thought the relationship with Jones and the old girl friend was pretty good. However, the plot itself became so silly that I didn't care after a while.</p></body></html>

Kaufman's great visuals give physical form to Joel's memories and their systematic destruction: Houses disintegrate, faces become blurred and entire streets crumble as, neuron by neuron, the procedure progresses.<br /><br />We learn that the impetus for this voluntary brain damage is Joel's roller-coaster romance, and bitter breakup, with the impulsive Clementine (Winslet). As in 'Adaptation' Kaufman approaches love with a realism that is often deeply cynical but ultimately betrays a loner's desire to be loved. Everyman Joel and the untameable Clementine make a good pair, and most of us will be able to identify with their tumultuous relationship.<br /><br />An excellent, highly imaginative exploration of how the little things in life, good or bad, make us who we are. DVD includes commentary, interviews with Kaufman and Carrey as well as some other extras. Highly recommended DVD!</p></body></html>

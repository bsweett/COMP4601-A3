I loved the innocence of Harry and Ron and the way that they are friends with Hermione.  Just a great movie for all young and old!<br /><br />Harry gets help in going back to school although a house elf named Dobby  doesn't want him to.  As he knows that Harry is in great danger!  But Harry is saved by Ron and the Wesely brothers come and save him in the flying car...which is cool shown on screen.  And we begin Harry's second year at Hogwarts.  I loved this movie...full of action and fantasy.  There are many things we learn about Harry in this movie such as someone is a parseltounge.  If you read the books you will already know what happens but it is neat to see how someone else sees the same thing you did.  And if you haven't read the book and loved the first movie I think you will be happy with one as it give you insight into Harry and will help with future books and movies.</p></body></html>

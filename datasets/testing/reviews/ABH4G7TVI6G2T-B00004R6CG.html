<meta name="summary" content=""Here I was born, and there I died. It was only a moment for you; you took no notice""></head><body><p>When San Francisco police detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) is forced to step down from his job after beginning to suffer crippling attacks of agraphobic vertigo, a former friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), approaches him with a job.  Gavin's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) is delusional, and obsessed with Carlotta, a relative from generations passed, who killed herself in the name of love; and Gavin is afraid that Madeleine has a similar death-wish.  Could Scottie trail Madeleine in an effort to uncover the truth?  Scottie agrees, and finds himself slowly falling for the ghostly blonde.<br /><br />This is Hitchcock's ultimate tale of obsession and fascination.  Hitchcock himself held an often frightening obsession for his leading ladies, and one can't help but feel that perhaps Hitch also explored his own inner turmoils whilst working on VERTIGO.  The story itself was based on "D'Entre Les Morts" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac; Samuel Taylor (of "Sabrina" fame) and Alec Coppel developed it for the screen.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart reveals a frightening, hitherto-unexplored side of his screen persona in his performance as Scottie.  The final portion of the movie is especially unsettling as Scottie's obsession completely overpowers him.  Costumed in a gray silk suit and washed-out blonde hair, so as to look like she's "just stepped out of the San Francisco fog", Kim Novak is a brilliant Madeleine.  One character I wish they'd spent more time exploring was Scottie's best friend Midge (played with great skill by Barbara Bel Geddes).  She sort of disappears without any real closure, and I feel the character deserved much more.  There are distinct holes in the plot, but at the end of the day, this is Hitchcock, and fabulous Hitchcock at that.<br /><br />I hope it comes to Blu-ray soon, for a full High Definition transfer will only heighten the quality of the glorious Katz/Harris restoration print, which has been the basis for the last three DVD releases.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A pleasant surprise"></head><body><p>The undeniable charm of In Bruges lies in it's lead cast and the dynamite direction and script from Martin McDonagh; who weaves a tale of hitmen Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson).  Ray is the rookie who recently made a horrible mistake during a hit, while Ken is the wily veteran who seeks to help the lad out any way they can.  Under orders from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes), they are holed up in Bruges; a small, tourist town in Belgium, which becomes quite a big factor as things develop and slowly spin out of control.  If you've seen trailers or previews of In Bruges, you may think this is a straight out dark comedy.  Well, while it certainly features it's share of comedic moments (mostly by Farrell), In Bruges is better described as being the well-paced and just plain refreshing gangster drama that deserves your attention.  Farrell, Gleeson, and Fiennes are spectacular and magnetic, the dialogue is addictive, and the film's conclusion is just plain shattering.  All in all, In Bruges more than deserves your attention, and even if you've never heard of the film and the description tickles your fancy, check this out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""An Excellent Masterpiece""></head><body><p>The 1970's were the best year for cinematic movie making; "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" is one of the best films from that decade and has now gone down in history as being an all-time classic. This masterpiece is perfect in every sense of the word from the performances to the direction to the writing. "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" is also one of those rare films that was nominated for every major Academy Award; it in turn won in all the top categories including being Best Picture of 1975.<br /> Jack Nicholson, in a flawless performance, plays a man signed into a mental hospital. His character, McMurphy, is not at all crazy, but he is put in this particular hospital to be evaluated after spending time on a state farm (jail). Once at the hospital McMurphy meets many patients as well as the rigid Nurse Ratchet. To say that McMurphy livens up the hospital as well as its inhibitants is an undersatement. The movie is hilarious, but at the same time touching as mental illness is explored in a humorous way.<br /> The DVD comes with a 47 minute documentary on the making of the film. Michael Douglas (one of the film's producers), Louise Fletcher, director Milos Forman, and others are all interviewed. Jack Nicholson, unfortunately, is not in the featurette. The film is a 2001 digital transfer from restored elements and there is a splendid commentary from Forman, Douglas, and Saul Zaentz. Subtitles are in English and French and the trailer is included.</p></body></html>

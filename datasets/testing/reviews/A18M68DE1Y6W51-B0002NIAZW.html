<meta name="summary" content="The Mother of All Disaster Films"></head><body><p>I love disaster films. Absolutely love them. So when a movie comes along that has not only tornadoes, not only tidal waves, not only the blizzard of all blizzards, but a preachy message on global warming, I'm "down with it," as they say.<p>Yes, the plot is cheesy, but so what? EVERY disaster movie plot is cheesy. It's part of the charm! Of course we have the earnest scientist (Dennis Quaid, looking great; age becomes him), the nonbelieving government officials (look for the Cheney lookalike playing--surprise, surprise, the Vice President of the United States), the romance thrown in for good measure--the hero scientists who risk their lives for the Greater Good--I mean, what more can you want?<p>The special effects are spectacular, especially the tornadoes destroying Los Angeles and the tidal wave hitting New York. As a person who does not enjoy flying at the best of times, I have to say that the turbulent airplane ride was much too real for my tastes. I found my palms sweating!<p>The premise of a new Ice Age is pretty scary. And maybe the stuff that happens in this film can't really happen, as our real-life scientists say. But the message on global warming might, just might, reach a few close-minded people, because if this film can't happen, something bad is sure to be in the offing, right? I just hope it's not a tidal wave over Philadelphia (where I live).<p>Really, this is a fun film, a great summer blockbuster, and a visual stunner. I recommend it!</p></body></html>

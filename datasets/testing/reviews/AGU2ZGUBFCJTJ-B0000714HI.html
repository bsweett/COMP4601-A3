The original Austin Powers grossed only $53 million but the movie became a cult favorite on video. New Line, the studio that produced the original, opted for a sequel. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, released in 1999, grossed $205 million by the end of its run. With that success, New Line was more then willing to pay Mike Myers $25 million to come up with another sequel to the hit comedy series. Will the third installment continue the tradition of being better then the last or will it follow the path of most sequels this year and be a piece of trash?<p>The story goes that Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, has finally captured his archenemy, Dr. Evil. But while Dr. Evil is in jail,?Nigel Powers, Austin's father, is kidnapped by Goldmember. Goldmember is an evil Dutch scientist from the 1970's who has a huge obsession with gold. The obsession is so big that he even had his privates turned into gold after an unfortunate smelting accident. When Dr. Evil escapes and plans the destruction of the world, Austin must team up with old flame Foxxy Cleopatra and save the world and his father.  The story for Austin Powers in Goldmember is well paced but much less so then Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. The film has tons of great moments within the course of the film but in between those moments the story slows greatly and for extended periods of time. It also gets a little confusing in the end with the involvement of Austin's family, which will not be revealed in this review, but it seems to work out. Some fans of the comedy series may be disappointed though by the revelations.<p>Mike Myers plays four characters this time in the new installment of the series. He portrays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastuard, and the title character, Goldmember. Myers seems to pay off with each of these characters except Goldmember. Goldmember seems to?be a pointless character and just plain?disguisting especially when he eats his own peeling skin. The character doesn't sound very Dutch and the Dutch jokes seem to be non-stop and annoying after some time. Some of the jokes may be a little offense to those that are Dutch but obviously this film was not intended to appeal to that kind of audience. Beyonce Knowles is one of the worst parts in Austin Powers in Goldmember. She is very attractive but the fact is that she is feels very out of place within the film. It's not her fault that her character isn't given many funny lines. Seth Green is even funnier as Dr. Evil's son especially when he decides to take over the family business. The baldness is scary but in a funny sort of way. Verne Troyer reprises his role as Mini-Me, the 1/8 sized clone of Dr. Evil, with many funny moments in the sequel. Most of the cameos in the film pay off greatly and are in perfect tune.<p>Overall, Austin Powers in Goldmember is better then the original but still not as funny as the first sequel. There were many things to pick at including the running time which seemed too short at only an hour and thirty-four minutes in length. Second, Beyonce Knowles is?neither great nor is she bad in this film but definitely feels out of place. Her '70's one liners begin to get tiresome?near the end of the film. Third, the film slows down for extended periods of time?before picking up again. This becomes annoying at keeping the audience interested. Most of the cameos worked very well but not all them. The Britney Spears cameo seemed very pointless. Though it suspected that she would end up being a Fembot, it just seemed like a cheap way for her to get into the film and be part of the soundtack for the film. The other cameos, though, are hilarious coming from Tom Cruise,?Steven Spielberg, Kevin Spacey, and Danny Devito especially in the opening ten minutes which are probably the best part in the entire film. Though the film isn't perfect, the entire experience is totally?unforgettable. This film may not appeal to?everyone since there is a huge amount of potty humor but most people will find something to giggle at. Not the best comedy of the year but still a funny diversion for the summer time blues.</p></body></html>

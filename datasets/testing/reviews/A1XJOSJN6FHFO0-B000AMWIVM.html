However, my family tells me if they are going to watch the comedies with me, I must watch some horrow with them.  So....I sat and watched "Saw."<br /><br />I have to say it was quite a different beginning and really got my attention with the two men in the bathroom, just what was going on? We find out our killer is somewhat different than the 'norm,' whatever that maybe. He has a purpose,an intent in what he is doing and who he is doing it to. Now, to just figure out what that is and why. All of our victims have a chance of saving their lives, but will they pay the price to do it?<br /><br />I think the ending was the best, what a shocker that was.<br /><br />All in all, not too gory and really had a different storyline.<br /><br />Now on to the comedies!</p></body></html>

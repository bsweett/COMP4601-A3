A terrific showdown between these two sci-fi monsters. The directing by Paul W.S. Anderson (who directed "Resident Evil" (2002), "Mortal Kombat" (1995), "Event Horizon" (1997), and "Soldier" (1998) is excellent. The story by Anderson, Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shusett is excellent. The screenplay by Anderson is excellent. The music by Harald Kloser (who recently did the music to "The Day After Tomorrow" (2004) with additional score by Thomas Schobel & Thomas Wanker, is excellent. The cinematography by David Johnson (who photographed Anderson's "Resident Evil" (2002) is excellent. The film editing by Alexander Berner is excellent. The casting by Nancy Bishop, Donna Isaacson, Christian Kaplan, & Suzanne Smith is excellent. The production design by Richard Bridgland (who production designed the upcoming "Wicker Park" (2004) & Anderson's "Resident Evil" (2002) is excellent. The art direction by Milena Koubkova, Adam O'Neil, & Justin Warburton-Brown is excellent. The set decoration by Peter Walpole is excellent. The costume design by Magali Guidasci (who recently costume designed "The Prince & Me" (2004) is excellent. The aliens and predators that were made by Amalgamated Dynamics Inc. are awesome and the visual effects are impressive. This is a well thought movie and well conceived idea that has been in making for nearly 15 years.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stylized, intelligent--but someone tell Quentin he can't act"></head><body><p>To a degree amateurish, but to an equal degree compelling and original, Reservoir Dogs is a stylistic, gritty look at the gangsters of Quentin Tarantino's imagination.  The story, such as it is, is the weak point of the film.  The strange tale of an undercover cop who tries to bust up a family-sized gangster ring is just plain silly at times.  The strong points, however, are many.  Each character has a terrific, interesting voice; the dialogue is snappy and artistic; the music choices are inspired.  And that infamous &quot;ear&quot; scene?  Frankly, it's one of the few scenes that doesn't work.  It just comes off as dumb.<p>Think of Reservior Dogs as the rough sketch for a movie yet to come:  Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction is superior in every respect, but it's a treat to see its progenitor.</p></body></html>

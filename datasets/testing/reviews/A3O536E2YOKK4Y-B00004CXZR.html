In truth, "The Motion Picture" addresses many of the deepest questions of life -- Is this all there is? Why are we here? Does love exist since it cannot be proved via pure logic? Who is the Creator? The core message is the intrinsic need to seek one's Creator and reconcile in order to attain a (necessary) higher level of consciousness. Those that hate the film and found it boring simply failed to penetrate beyond the surface.<br /><br />Like the Star Trek episodes "The Corbomite Maneuver" (#3) and "Metamorphosis" (#31), "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" is a mature, cerebral sci-fi story with very little action. Most kids and young adults won't like it or grasp it. It's depth is evidenced by the emotional wallop experienced when Spock grasps Kirk's hand in Sickbay, truly revealing emotion despite his conflicting desire to attain a consciousness of pure logic, or later when Spock weeps for V'ger and comments on its personal dilemma, which perfectly coincides with Spock's own search for fulfillment: "As I was when I came aboard, so is V'ger now -- empty, incomplete and searching. Logic and knowledge are not enough... Each of us at sometime in our lives turns to someone -- a father, a brother, a God -- and asks, 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its creator to find its answers."<br /><br />Another powerful sequence is a crewman's self-sacrificial fusion with V'ger so that it may evolve to the next level of awareness (seemingly self-sacrificial, that is).<br /><br />The fact that the film inspires such profound contemplation and emotion proves that it's not just a bad film that apologists try to make excuses for as critics claim, e.g. "It's deep and awe-inspiring; you just don't understand it." I'm not making excuses; it's simply the truth. If you are unable to accept this perhaps it's because YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH. (lol).<br /><br />My conclusion on the film runs parallel to Roger Ebert's comments: "My inclination, as I slid down in my seat and the stereo sound surrounded me, was to relax and let the movie give me a good time. I did and it did." In other words, just accept the film as is, and you WILL be entertained -- but put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, HA, HA!), kick back and relish the movie magic.<br /><br />Let me add that "The Motion Picture" was one of the most expensive films of its time, but it did well at the box office and thus made a decent profit -- a testimony to how hungry the public was for Star Trek after ten long years (since the cancellation of the original TV series in '69). In fact, aside from "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home," ST:TMP is still the most profitable of all the Star Trek feature films (Making FOUR TIMES its expense worldwide); it therefore can't very well be the cinematic turd that many critics claim. Also, consider the fact that ST:TMP made more at the box office than the acclaimed films "Alien" and "Apocalypse Now," both released the same year (1979).<br /><br />I should add that, although this film is an "Grade A" picture as far as epic, awe-inspiring pieces of cinematic art go, I understand why some would grade it lower. In such cases I suggest making the necessary psychological adjustments and watching it again as it is more along the lines of "The Cage" (#1) than "The Doomsday Machine" (#35). If this doesn't work, stick with more lightweight fare like "Zathura" or even "Star Wars" (giggle). Just joking.<br /><br />The viewer will note that "The Motion Picture" is truly the sole Star Trek film that aspires to and attains a level of cinematic awe along the lines of "2001: A Space Odyssey." Actually, "The Motion Picture" is LEAGUES better IMHO. "2001" lacks characters whom the viewer truly cares about; it's also cold and overly artsy, with way too many unnecessarily boring sequences (but, don't get me wrong, if "2001" trips your trigger, that's great). "The Motion Picture," by contrast, has heart. Not to mention an interesting story that delves into the deepest of all universal questions.<br /><br />Say what you will, but "The Motion Picture" towers alone, utterly unique in the feature film series -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nothing's Changed"></head><body><p>After getting dogged by many Resident Evil fans about the 1st film not being truly true to the game, Anderson decides to make the sequel more closer to the game's sequels. Didn't do a very good job of doing that.<br /><br />The fools from Umbrella Corp. unleash the dead in the hive, and now the T-Virus is spreading through out Raccoon City. Citizens cannot leave the city, and now are trapped with the walking dead.<br /><br />Jovovich returns as the dull and boring Alice, who now has super powers like a fake ass Albert Wesker wannabee from Code Veronica X. Along trapped in Raccoon City is Jill Valentine (Guillory), a reporter (Holt), 2 Umbrella soldiers (Fehr, Ward), a citizen (Epps) and a few others I don't care mentioning.<br /><br />On their tales is a killing maching called Nemesis (Taylor). Once again, no gore, dull characters, and boring Alice taking away the spoylight from real characters from the game. Nemesis is a weak sissy in this film, and he looks cheesey. Nicholai in the game is a old and evil man. In this movie, Nicholai is a young man on the good guys' side.<br /><br />The slow-motion scenes of the zombies' walking looks stupid, and once again, these zombies are pitiful. This film does have a few good scenes, good fight scenes, and the ending isn't bad. However, it's just like the first film...disappointing.<br /><br />Resident Evil really needs to be redone soon. And when I mean redone, I mean no Anderson, no Screen Gems, and no Alice. At least these Resident Evil films are good for one thing...they entertain.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sean Penn's Masterpiece Theater!"></head><body><p>If anyone would dare give this heartwarming, heartrending, beautifully shot movie a bad review - they have no heart.<br /><br />Sean Penn's Into The Wild is a tour-de-force in showcasing a real-life young man's desire to lose himself into the wilds of Alaska. Although he comes from a wealthy family, and is college educated, young McCandless finds a soul-searing pull that no one understands - but himself.<br /><br />An unwavering desire to leave civilization behind, due in part to his families morbid background while growing up, but with a strong bond of love from his sister, young McCandless still feels the need to find his destiny in the Alaskan wilderness.<br /><br />Beautifully shot in fantastic locations, Sean Penn also captures much more of the human heart in this strong, although somewhat tragic tale of the human spirit. I felt the highs and lows of this young man's journeys, from finding people to help heal, to finding first love in the strangest of places, this movie will take viewers on a journey of one young man's self-discovery, filling the vacuums of different people's hearts, and in various beautiful ways, that anyone with half a heart can't help but feel.<br /><br />Sean Penn truly captured on film the raw emotions that lie within us all. The beauty, and the beast that lies just under the surface, but which few of us truly understand, nor usually act upon.<br /><br />Into the Wild is a masterpiece in so many ways: from its acting to its cinematography, it is a true portrait of a young man's life that few people can truly call upon themselves to actually do that they most desire to dream about - leave the thin veneer of civilization behind and lose themselves into the beautiful but deadly landscapes of the wild.<br /><br />This remarkable film deserves every penny and accolade it got. Actually, it deserved much, much more. A film like this is rarely made, actually able to capture the raw essence of numerous people's lives of all its wide varieties.<br /><br />If the ending of this film doesn't draw strong emotion in you, full of its tragic but beautiful way, then you truly do not know what it means to be human.<br /><br />After seeing this film, Sean Penn has proven to me he is as good - if not better - than such huge directors such as Spielberg and the like.<br /><br />A must see for people who really should honor this fantastic young man's life.</p></body></html>

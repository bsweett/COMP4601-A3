<meta name="summary" content="A Great Science Fiction Film"></head><body><p>Unlike many of the reviewers I have not read Isaac Asimov's "I, Robot" stories.  Literature of any kind cannot be translated to a film without changes.  The only alternative is to shoot the entire book, which results in a film like Erich von Stroheim's Greed, intended to run for 8 hours.  Film makers have little choice but to make compromises.  Looking at the film on its own, I think that I, Robot is a great science fiction film.<br /><br />The place, Chicago in 2035, is a real look into the future and was planned that way by the director Alex Proyas.  The look of the city was designed as it might appear in the future with familiar old buildings and new futuristic designs.  Cars were designed especially for the film to present a logical representation of what people might be driving in 2035.  Altogether, the film presents a complete futuristic world down to the clothing people wear. The story has mystery and suspense and is nicely paced.  The special effects, particularly the robots, were designed to make them believable and not just for a splashy look.  The actors who played the robots were taught to walk and act as a robot.<br /><br />Will Smith does a great job playing the brooding Detective Spooner. I tend to think of Mr. Smith as a comedic actor but he has proven he can handle dramatic roles and in I, Robot he gives his character the right edginess and demeanor.  His distrust of robots comes through without overstatement.  Perhaps Smith's shooting from an airborne motorcycle is a little hard to believe but not impossible, and don't we want a movie to have some excitement. Bridget Moynahan is well cast as Susan Calvin, who designs robots to appear more human and has a gradual transformation from her belief that robots are entirely benign (Ms. Moynahan also has a miraculous shooting sequence, firing a weapon with her eyes closed and hitting only a robot).  Alan Tudyk provides a sensitive performance as Sonny the robot.  We never see Mr. Tudyk's face but his movements and voice make Sonny a real and sympathetic character.  Unfortunately, James Cromwell's character, Dr. Alfred Lanning, dies at the start of the film so we see him only briefly in messages he recorded before his death.  The only significant extra on the DVD is a short piece on "Making of I, Robot."  This has the standard interviews with the stars, director, writers and special effects personnel that gives a good overview of how the film was made and what the director and producers were aiming for in making the film.  By the standards of many DVDs the extras are skimpy for I, Robot.<br /><br />I found I, Robot to be an engrossing film where you care about the characters and are intrigued by the story.  The look of the film is fabulous and takes you into this world of the future in a similar way that Total Recall made Mars a believable place. Highly recommend.</p></body></html>

Back in 1960, there simply was nothing around to compare, as this movie opened new ground in horror, and even in black and white, it was chilling, perhaps even more so...Janet Leigh was superb, and notice her expression when she is driving away with the money from the man at the bank, who flirted with her, and her thoughts as to how he would react when he discovered the theft. There was another scene, not the shower one, which scared me to death, and the buildup to it was agonizing. In fact, every time we had to go into the Bates house, I was a wreck. When one man complained to Hitchcock that his wife, after seeing the movie, refused to take showers, the Master replied: "Have her dry cleaned..." The Highway Patrol cop who follows her, with great suspicion, is fabulous, his sunglasses obscuring his eyes, and his thoughts, and the car salesman, who is also suspicious and somewhat put off by her desperation...Norman Bates, with his collection of taxidermy, is great, and Perkin's performance here is all the more remarkable considering his previous filmwork was in "Friendly Persuasion", playing the good Quaker son...and Martin Balsam, as the detective helping Vera Miles find her sister, was excellent, and one of my favorite lines of his, to Bates: "It doesn't gel, it isn't aspic..." flatly doubting his contention that he never met or knew the lady in question. I am definitely getting the DVD collector's edition, and plan to watch it during our next thunderstorm, as if it needed more atmosphere! Enjoy...</p></body></html>

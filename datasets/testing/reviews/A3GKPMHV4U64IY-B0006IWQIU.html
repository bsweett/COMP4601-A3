<meta name="summary" content="Hunter Against Killer"></head><body><p>Way back when, a short story appeared in the pages of Dark Horse Presents that made a link between the creatures from the movies Alien and Predator.  Readers wanted more.  Many stories, comics and books later the match up finally made it to the big screen.  Unfortunately it did not have the lure and fascination of its lineage.<br /><br />Satellite imagery uncovers a buried pyramid in Antarctica near an abandoned whaling station.  A team is sent to check it out.  Apparently a team from space is also arriving to check it out.  The pyramid has characteristics of several ancient civilizations.  The features are all on the outside for inside the pyramid has more open space than any pyramid should.  This is a hunting preserve.  Every one hundred years alien hunters arrive to battle horrible serpents.  The archeological team accidentally sets things in motion a little too early.  An alien queen is revived, eggs are laid and the game begins.  From there the movie becomes straight action with little suspense until the ending.<br /><br />The Alien movies all take place in the future.  The Predator movies are contemporary.  This movie is contemporary.  Predator movies were action oriented while Alien gained fame through suspense.  This movie is action oriented.  By the end I wasn't sure why this film had been made.  While an Aliens vs Predator movie is a good idea this one seemed to bring in the wrong elements, or at least not the right ones.  Some scenes from the trailers are actually not part of the main movie, but part of a "history lesson" provided so the viewer has some idea what is going on.  I was also taken aback by how easily the pyramid was damaged.  Every fight crushed huge amounts of stone yet the pyramid had been intact after seemingly being used for millennia.  Definitely a disappointment.</p></body></html>

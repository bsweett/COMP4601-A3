Roy's house, the muisc he listens to (Frank Sinatra) and his very essence has been imported from the early 60's into the 21st Century. Unfortunately, Roy lives a life trapped in routine; he suffers from an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder caused by the way he lives his life; he's a flimflam man, a con man with more cons than a cardshark has aces up his sleeve. Roy's obsessive compulsive behavior and tics are out of control because his supplier of medication has skipped town. Without his illegally obtained medication, Roy is out of control and goes into extreme cleaning mode. He can't function and he can't work because his nervous ticks and behavior will give him away.<p>His obnoxious and messy partner Frank (the marvelous Sam Rockwell) urges him to see a shrink.  Now he must see a real doctor and discuss his very real problems something very much against his nature. His new psychiatrist Dr. Klein manages to get Roy on the couch just long enough to discover that Roy has a daughter he's never seen and an ex-wife that has told more lies than she has fingers about his whereabouts. Dr. Klein urges Roy to contact his daughter suggesting part of his problems may be related to the fact that he has no one to relate to and leads a solitary, lonely life. Roy's life takes both a turn for the better and the worse as his daughter turns out to have a talent for conning all her own...<p>&quot;Matchstick Men&quot; plays almost like a dysfunctional variation on &quot;The Sting&quot; with quirky, nebbish characters at its heart. Director Ridley Scott (&quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;) shows he has a deft ability with comedy in this unique film.  His clever use of 60's and 50's stylistic touches and Cage's rich performance make &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; instantly memorable and enjoyable. All the members of the supporting cast are of an equal caliber. Rockwell steals many of the scenes he shares with Cage, which is quite an accomplishment, and Allison Lohman does a great job playing Roy's seemingly sweet but manipulative daughter. The plot features enough twists and turns for a high-grade roller coaster.  Kudos must also be given to screenwriters Nicholas and Ted Griffin for their sardonic and rich screenplay. While the audience can see where the film is leading well before the final third of the film creating sympathy for some very unsypathetic characters, Scott and his cast make the ride as entertaining as possible.<p>The rich and colorful transfer of &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; looks exceptional. The warm colors of Southern California come across in the rich cinematographer by John Matheison and are faithfully reproduced on the DVD as well. <p>Viewers won't get burned with the extras on this single disc, dual layer edition. There's an in-depth feature length documentary focusing on the entire process of making a motion picture. It's a fascinating glimpse into the process of making a motion picture for film fans.  There's also a interesting commentary track from Scott and the screenwriters. <p>A funny, entertaining movie with some very cool and unique extras, &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; shows that Scott way with comedy. Cage, Rockwell, Lohman and McGill all give funny, detailed performances that are highlighted in the marvelous commentary as well as the production featurettes. The sharp transfer looks exceptional despite some minor digital blemishes. &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; is definitely worth picking up, as you'll enjoy the rich, detailed world that Scott and his collaborators have created.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""The Suck," the movie"></head><body><p>In the book that gave rise to this film, one of Anthony Swofford's  Marine buddies refers to the Corps as "the Suck." That pretty much captures the author's love-hate relationship to the Marines. And "suck" is what I think about this adaptation of Swoff's fine memoir.<br /><br />Jarhead the book is a cerebral exercise that dissects the hilarious, pointless and terrifying experience of joining, training for and being a warrior in the US Marine Corps during the first Gulf War. Jarhead the film extracts the small amount of action in the book (except, sadly, for the prodigious bouts of drinking and screwing) and plops them onto the screen, drained of humor, emotion, irony or context. No comparison to the power of the book.</p></body></html>

Its true, while the first Matrix brought about new origins in movie animation and cgi, Matrix Reloaded takes it x100.  The action is amazing, it will blow you away almost to the point that you've had enough.  Major action and visual effects fans will dig this.  True harcorde fans of the Matrix story might be dissapointed.<br /><br />The story almost takes a backseat to the action.  The plot is dragged out throughout huge action scenes that seem to never end -  example-  Neo vs dozens of Smiths lasting forever, and the highway chase that lasts as long as I-95 runs.  While these scenes are truly spectacular, they take away from the story somewhat.  Gone is the great in depth exploration into the Matrix.  Very little is newly introduced to us about the Matrix, and the story now focuses on Neo and the rest of humanity saving itself from destruction, both from the machines in the real world, and Smith in the Matrix world.  We do get to meet the architect of the Matrix, though not as astounding as one would think.<br /><br />Overall this is not as good as the first one, but you'll still want to see it to see how the trilogy continues.  If you love never-ending action and cgi, you will want to watch this over and over and over.  The movie is worth buying on that regard.  As for a compeleing story, you might be ok stopping after the first Matrix and being satisfied.  If you do see Reloaded, you'll have to see Revolutions too, since both technically are one big film split into 2 parts.</p></body></html>

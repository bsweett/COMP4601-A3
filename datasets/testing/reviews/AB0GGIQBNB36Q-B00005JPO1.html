<meta name="summary" content="where has Indiana jones gone"></head><body><p>The first movie was written and directed like the old serials of the 40's and 50's had been, Raiders Of the Lost Ark was awsome. Temple Of Doom, fell flat on it's face. Not too hard, but it fell. Indian Jones and the last crusade was terrific, sean connery playing his dad. Bringing some of the characters from the first movie into the last one was great. Steven spielberg and george lucas caught lightning in a bottle, with this series. Then came 2008, and the fourth Indiana Jones movie. It opened up descently enough, with him and his new found friend being taken to Area 51 by the Russians. We get a cameo shot of the Ark, which is all well and good. But one major problem poked it's ugly little head early for me, Harrison Ford is old and he looked it. I would've had no problem with a fourth movie say 2 years after the third one, but not 19 years later! Anyway, the Russians want him to look for one of the crystal skulls that's hidden at Area 51, he escapes. But not after having a showdown with one of the bad guys deep in the bowels of area 51, and getting strapped to a land rocket. But wait....... there's more, he finds himself in a nuclear test site. And MANAGES TO SURVIVE THE NUCLEAR BLAST BY JUMPING INTO A LEADLINED REFIDGERATOR, now some of you may think i'm nitpicking. But I'm not, in the specials section. Steven spielberg had to george Lucas, he didn't want to do a fourth movie. Lucas and Ford begged and begged for him to do it, Lucas had even written the script. And spielberg finally agreed to do it, but only if there weren't any aliens. Since that's how Lucas had pitched the idea for the movie, Lucas agreed, AND CHANGED THEM TO INTERDIMENSIONAL BEINGS. Yep, complete with a flying saucer at the end. We even get marion in this, annnnd it's almost like why?!, really?! This movie  was also very glossy, unlike the other movies. Indiana Jones has always been about archeology, not aliens. And that is where they failed, even the original score felt out of place. I kept wanting this movie to get better, and it never did. Not even close.</p></body></html>

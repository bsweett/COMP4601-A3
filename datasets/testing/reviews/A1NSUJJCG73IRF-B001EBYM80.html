<meta name="summary" content="The Green Mile (1999)"></head><body><p>Director:  Frank Darabont<br />Cast:  Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Jeter, David Morse, Sam Rockwell.<br />Running Time:  180 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, langage, and a grisly execution scene.<p>As with many Stephen King novel adaptations, many viewers complain that the book was far scarier than the film and that the images portrayed visually are not nearly as efficient and signifant than on paper.  &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, an epic flim representation of the serial book series written by King in the mid 1990s, is an example of how some films are just as good as the book.<p>Tom Hanks gives another above-adequate performance as the head chief of a maximum-security penitentiary who discovers that a new cell inhabitant may not be all that he seems.  As the film unfolds and director Frank Daraont reveals the truth about the mammoth criminal (played by Michael Clarke Duncan), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; becomes less of a rehash of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and more of a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode spliced with &quot;Cocoon&quot;.<p>The film has a great supporting cast, especially that cute little mouse Mr. Jangles (not credited), and an excellent, emotionally-involved script that will grab viewers and keep them captivated until the very end.  While a little long in its deliverance, this motion picture is one that can truly touch the hearts of individuals and shed tears in those who would not have thought possible.  A supernatural tale that seems out of place in portions, but overall a heartwarming drama that will surprise, scare, and arrest you.</p></body></html>

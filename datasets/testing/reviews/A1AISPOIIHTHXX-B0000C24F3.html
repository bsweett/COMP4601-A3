Halfway through it fell apart despite some genius scenes. Fox packaged all 4 films including special edition type films, and many other goodies for a set that is just massive to get through.<br /><br />Alien(1979): Ridley Scott directed the first one which is my second favorite. It had a really slow build and what freaks people out about it is the unknown. A creature who can blend into the architecture of the ship and it was a claustrophic and paranoid type of fear, like knowing something's there but not knowing when it'll appear. It has the legendary chestburster scene and Sigourney in those cute panties.<br /><br />Aliens(1986): James Cameron directed this one and it's my favorite. Again slow build but this one is more intense. More action and combat driven, arguably a gorier chestburster scene, a character's outcome which I can't help but feel sorry for(hint: he's not like his original counterpart) and a cool ending fight. The deleted scenes flesh out Ripley's character more and her relationship with Newt.<br /><br />Alien 3(1992): David Fincher directed this one and he practically disowns it from his filmography. It's not THAT bad but it does have weak storyline and script problems but it's great visually. The "alien vision" in the tunnels is cool but it has oddly bad CG.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection(1997): Jean-Pierre Jeunet directed this one and it's pretty bad too but the underwater chase is thrilling and the end gore scene is quite brutal but the script just seems too convenient or just odd(200 years for a Ripley clone? Who just happens to have all memories intact? And is pregnant no less?) Plus quite a bit gorier than the others which is interesting cause I always thought the series worked when there wasn't a lot of gore.<br /><br />There's 9 discs in all, one for each film in it's entirety plus the extended editions and commentaries etc and the 2nd disc delving into the making of the films. The 9th disc is stuff like trailers for each film and extra stuff. I doubt they would make a 5th considering the box office intake and just general lacklusterness of the last 2 but here's hoping it takes it into a good and new direction before it gets stale. But for now, marvel at the first 2, and just try to entertain yourself with the last 2.</p></body></html>

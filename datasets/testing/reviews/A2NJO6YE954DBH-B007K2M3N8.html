<meta name="summary" content="Kevin Spacey does it all in this Bobby Darin bio-pic"></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey did "Beyond the Sea" so that a new generation of fans could fall in love with the songs of Bobby Darin.  Of course, the person we are really impressed with by the end of this 2004 bio-pic is Spacey (on the off chance that there are those who do not recognize him as one of the finest actors of his generation).  Spacey directs "Beyond the Sea," he wrote the script (apparently off of a 1987 draft by Lewis Colick), he stars as Bobby Darin, he sings Bobby Darin's songs himself and he even does his own dancing.  We are so busy being impressed by Kevin Spacey that we almost forget to be impressed by Bobby Darin, but I think everybody will find a point in this film when they decide they like what the man is singing because there are so many different facets to his music one must inevitable hit home.  I always liked "Mack the Knife" over "Splish Splash" or "Dream Lover," but these days I think of him and Tim Hardin doing each other's songs, "Simple Song of Freedom" and "If I Were a Carpenter," respectively).<br /><br />In terms of bio-pics this one has a touch of "All That Jazz (granted, that was an allegorical bio-pic for Bob Fosse, but that can count too).  This film has a post-modern self-reflexivity in the idea Darin is staging his life and doing what he wants in telling his own story ("Memories are like moonbeams," we are reminded more than once), but I think it is also simply a device for validating Spacey playing the young Darin.  By now it is clear, this is Kevin Spacey's movie, body and soul, and he can do whatever he wants in it and with it, which includes little Bobby Darin (William Ullrich) rebuking the older Bobby Darin for getting things wrong.  Born Walden Robert Cassotto, he suffered from rheumatic fever as a child and was not expected to live.  So turning himself into Bobby Darin and trying to replace Frank Sinatra as the most popular singer and failing is not exactly the worst thing that could ever happen to a fella.  Being loved by your mother (Brenda Blethyn) and sister, Nina (Caroline Aaron), and marrying Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth) can be part of the good life as well.<br /><br />Spacey also gets credit for getting this movie made.  Hollywood has been kicking a Bobby Darin film around for decades, with everybody from Bruce Willis and Tom Cruise to Leonardo Di Caprio and Johnny Depp supposedly going to star and the likes of Barry Levison and Paul Schrader directing.  But for Spacey this is clearly a personal effort.  There is a disclaimer at the end that there should not be any assumption that Darin's family and friends have endorsed this film, but it is hard to believe that they would see it as anything other than an act of love by Spacey.  Darin's story has ups and downs, both of which are chronicled by the film, and the story, like Darin's life, ends on an upswing before he dies during heart surgery at the age of 37.  But the final high point was nowhere near where Darin was at the height of his popularity, so this is still a sense of sadness at the end, as there should be.  When "Beyond the Sea" is over you are going to want to listen to these songs again.  It will be interesting to see if you go for one of the hit collections of Bobby Darin or if you go for Kevin Spacey on the soundtrack album.</p></body></html>

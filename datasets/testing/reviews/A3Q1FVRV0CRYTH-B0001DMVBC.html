<meta name="summary" content="A Beautiful and Powerhouse of a story gets brilliantly casted and wonderfully put together!"></head><body><p>House of Sand and Fog was one of the best films of 2003 and should have recieved more credit where credit was due (namely in a Best Actress nod for Connelly and a Best Picture nod to say the least) but alas for the Oscars only rewarded Kingsley's potrayal of Iranian imagrant Massoud Amir Behrani and his wife played by outstanding newcomer Shohreh Aghdashloo, and don't get me wrong because they deserved it, but there should have been more awards to it's name.  Kingsley plays an Iranian man who purchases a home for his family, as an investment in order to turn a profit.  Connelly plays the owner of the home, Kathy, who gets everything ripped right out from under her feet.  Technically the house is still hers, but legally it was already sold.  You see the tax office made a mistake and accused Kathy of owing money she didn't owe, so they sold her house.  The key there is that she didn't owe anything and so now she must fight to regain ownership of her house.  The acting, as I stated early on, is a knockout punch with outstanding performances by everyone involved but more notable on Connelly's part who nailed her role and proved that 'A Beautiful Mind' was not a fluke (but anyone who has seen her in Requiem of a Dream already knows that)...I urge any and everyone to see this film.  It touches on so much more than ownership of a house but what makes us as humans whole and how we will fight to know that we matter.  Kathy fights for a house that means the world to her...it is all the stability she has left, the only part of her life that hasn't been ruined by her alcaholism and is the only thing that gives her hope of one day overcoming all and living a normal, stable life.  Massoud will fight for a house that means a future for his family.  The ending is stunning and will make you lose breath.  Please, I urge you...watch this film!</p></body></html>

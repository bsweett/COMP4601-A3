The performance by Charlize Theron is truly one of the best ever on film by an actress. I had know idea she could act until I saw this brutal portrayal of this killer with my own eyes. She deserved her Oscar easily. I also thought Christina Ricci was very good too as Selby, her sidekick and partner. Rent this movie and watch it once. It is well made, but I doubt many can stomach this fairly disturbing film more than a couple of times. And who would want to?</p></body></html>

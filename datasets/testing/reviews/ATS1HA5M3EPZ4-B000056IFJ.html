An elite perfectionist, he is one of the few who knows how to meticulously balance a love story smack dab in the middle of a Science Fiction action movie.  The story starts in modern day 1984 (not so modern anymore) where a cyborg has been sent back in time to destroy the birth mother of the machines greatest enemy so that their nemesis cannot be created.  Thankfully the girl has a common name and lives in Los Angeles where several women exist with the same name.  Being logical, the killer intends to take them all out.  One by one the women fall victim to this `serial killer' and Sarah, played by a younger Linda Hamilton, starts to think she's next...and she's right.  Enter the man to save her life, Kyle Reece, played intensly by Michael Biehn.  He's a soldier from the future who is sent back to protect her from this unfeeling machine.  The best part about these two coming through the portal from the furture is that they come through with nothing.  So they have to rely on what is already in 1984.  This eliminates many complex elements in the story, as well as some costlier special effects.  It keeps grounded a little more.  Since the weaponry they're forced to use is less sophisticated, the Terminator is harder to  kill.  Kyle and Sarah find themselves not only running for their lives but finding something more in each other.  This movie sounds like a cheesy love story within an action movie but there is a special chemistry between the two leads and Cameron juggles them all like a professional circus performer.  Both Hamilton and Biehn's character have a dire innocence about them.  Sarah has no idea that anything she ever does could be considered so important, and being told the reason why this machine is after her makes her world seem that much smaller.  Reece has never known deep emotions of love, and the only women he has ever known are tough soldier types.  Getting to know Sarah makes him really feel what he knows was in his heart already.  <p>No one but Arnold could play the Cyborg Tank that stalks poor Linda Hamilton throughout the movie.  His unstoppablility is only outdone by his cold unfeeling exterior and deadly violent actions.  The chemistry between Biehn and Hamilton is strong and believeable.  The action scenes are intense and you always know what's going on.  I would highly recommend this film.  It set a standard for many other Sci Fi films, as well as gave birth to one of the greatest sequels of all time, Terminator 2, Judgement Day.</p></body></html>

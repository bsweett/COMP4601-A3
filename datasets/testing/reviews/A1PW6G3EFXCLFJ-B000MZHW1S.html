<meta name="summary" content="A ROLLICKINGLY GOOD ACTION FLICK"></head><body><p>A gritty action flick set in Africa, BLOOD DIAMOND features Leonardo DiCaprio as a smuggler who learns that Djimon Houson has found a large diamond and partners with him to recover the hidden stone and rescue his (Hounson's) family. Obstacles to these goals include a brutal civil war and greedy mercenaries. Both DiCaprio and Hounson give strong performances with DiCaprio nicely managing a couple of different dialects. Jennifer Connelly is passable as the magazine writer/journalist with good intentions and the nose for a good story who befriends DiCaprio and provides minimal romantic interest. Unfortunately, the film is laced with a strong preachness that contaminates any pure, honest story-telling and descends BLOOD DIAMOND into a vehicle for political propaganda. Apparently, the movie would claim, consumers who buy diamonds are supporting all kinds of awful things, from murderous civil war to corruption to terrorism. This is a conjecture not supported by sustainable arguement in the film. However, if you don't mind paying to be preached to or if you can ignore the shrill, emotional flim-flam of the latest leftist cause celebre, then BLOOD DIAMOND offers entertainment value as a rollickingly good action flick.</p></body></html>

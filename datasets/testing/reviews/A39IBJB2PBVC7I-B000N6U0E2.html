<meta name="summary" content="The Pursuit Of Schmaltziness"></head><body><p>I'm told that soprano sax hack Kenny G once played a sustained, uninterrupted note for an entire hour.  (There is no data available regarding how many audience members took their own lives in response.)  In The Pursuit of Happyness, Will Smith tops this dubious distinction by playing the same note for 2 hours straight, no variation in pitch, tempo, color, texture - unadulterated schmaltz.  Smith is box office gold because he's just so darn wholesome and non-threatening, which is precisely why he had no prayer of pulling this off.  Had it been played for real, this would have been a dark and chilling movie, ultimately an inspiring one, but it's far too well-scrubbed for that.<br /><br />Smith plays Chris Gardner, and Gardner's overriding passion is to be a good father.  He and real life son Jaden Smith traipse through the film like a couple of hobos; one expects to see them holding cigar butts with toothpicks and playing harmonicas.  Mom, played by the exotically beautiful Thandie Newton, abandons Chris, son, and the pleasures of San Francisco to work as a waitress in New York.  (Presumably there were no more waitress positions available in San Fran.)  Why she breaks that strongest of all bonds - mother and child - is never explained, she's a straw character exiting early.  This leaves us with only dad and son, and dad's big dream - which is to be a stockbroker.  The mystery of why anyone in his right mind would want to be a stockbroker is explained early on when Chris sees one parking a Ferrari - say no more!  Obviously a car like that is happiness - I mean happyness.<br /><br />Of course, you and I know better.  We know that the end of Chris's rainbow is not a pot of money; much less the maniacal streetwalking stockbrokers engage in to make that kind of money.  It is, of course, the relationship he has with his son - which he has had all along.  Unfortunately the director doesn't seem to know this, because all action drives from impoverishment to ultimate acceptance in the temple of lucre.  What makes this worse is that there seems to be no chemistry at all between Smith and his actual son.  Any chance the film had of touching a nerve depended entirely on a convincing performance by young Smith.  He is every bit as likeable as dear old dad, a real chip off the old blockhead, but there's no spark there at all.<br /><br />As the film reminds us, Jefferson spoke of the pursuit of happiness, i.e. one must seek it.  My advice, look a little harder.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NOT A BLIND-BUY RECOMENDATION FOR SURE"></head><body><p>Long and boring movie full of un-appealling roles for its stars. Some people have praised Matt Damon's performance but the fact his he uses the exact same expression for the three hours this thing lasts. His aging makeup (as well as Jolie's) is just plain ridiculous (does anybody really believe that's how they will look in their '50s) and his son looks just about the same age as him.<br />With apologies for the comparison but a week ago I saw the un-ambitious and inconsequential "Music and Lyrics", that is a film that aims low and achieves what it sets to do. This one aims high and totally fails. Personally I'd rather watch the first type.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="enjoyable and powerful film"></head><body><p>a very enjoyable film with captivating visuals (the filmmakers deserve much credit for filming in actual authentic locations) and powerful, realistic fight scenes.<br /><br />The story does test one's "believability standards" a bit, but in a manner akin to Gladiator and so many others. This is Hollywood. Sit back and give yourself to the movie. There is so much here to enjoy.</p></body></html>

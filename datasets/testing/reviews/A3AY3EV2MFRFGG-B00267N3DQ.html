<meta name="summary" content="Platinum edition sets platinum standards of excellence."></head><body><p>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (chosen by horror novelist Ramsey Campbell as the most terrifying movie he has ever seen, well everyone as at least on traumatic Disney viewing experience in their youth - for me it's Bambi) set the foundation upon which ALL of Disney's follow up animated features would be built.  Any fan of Disney, or animated movies in general, will see this as a required addition to their libraries.<p>The almost limitless 'immersive' DVD features will take months to watch and allow people a rare look into the creative process of mounting such a technically challenging project (the first of its kind) as this.<p>The film itself looks flawless, no speck, no grain, no fading, the colors just as bright and vibrant today as they were in 1937.  It is a mint condition presentation of a platinum standard film that set the mold.  Not only highly recommended, but, as I said, a required addition to any film buff's library.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Evil Mexican Vampire Strippers"></head><body><p>"Evil Mexican Vampire Strippers" -- sounds very cheesy, no? Well, as a matter of fact, "From Dusk Till Dawn" is. It's also weirdly entertaining in a gory, cheesy, bizarre vampire-laden way, with over-the-top vampires, crossbow-wielding teens, and ministers kicking butt alongside killer bank robbers. <p>The Gecko brothers are a pair of robbers on the run from the cops: Seth (George Clooney), a murdering thug with a few scruples left, and Ritchie (Quentin Tarantino) a murdering rapist psycho thug who has none. After destroying a roadside liquor, Ritchie "accidently" rapes and murders their hostage (no details are shown), and they take an ex-minister Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his teenage kids hostage. <p>Soon they ramble over the Mexican border in the minister's RV, to a strip club called... well, I probably can't say what it's called on amazon.com. But when a bar-brawl turns ugly, a snake-charming stripper (a cameo by Salma Hayek) suddenly turns into a not-so-pretty vampire. And Seth, his ex-hostages,<p>This is a B-movie in every sense, and there's something appealingly cheesy about it. It's a bit predictable -- you know as certain moments approach that so-and-so is going to turn around and be a vampire, you know that Jacob is going to regain his faith... but who cares? If you're looking for amazing plot twists, this is not the movie to watch. The first half is a seedy, gritty hostage situation; the second half is an unashamed flying-body-parts-wallow-in-the-black-gore-fest. <p>These vampires are not in the gorgeous stylish Anne Rice mold -- they are, pardon the pun, ugly as sin. The dialogue is mostly snappy except for the occasional line like "Welcome to slavery." The sets are impressively run-down, seedy and dusty, and the torchlit tunnel didn't even make me laugh at all. (Although as a woman, I would have preferred less stripping -- I fast-forwarded through that part. Or was Rodriegez making a comment on stripper clubs by filling them with evil vampires?) And it takes a good director to not make me laugh at vampire heads bursting into flame as a kid flings holy water balloons at them, or the "disco ball" scene near the end.<p>Weirdly, Clooney actually makes us care about Seth; he has virtually no redeeming characteristics until the vampires start up. Then we get to see a certain change of heart in him now that he's seen that, including the surreal but effective scene where he lectures Jacob on God, heaven, hell, and why he now believes in them (now there's irony for you!). Ritchie has no such luck scriptwise; this psychotic creep was more appealing as a vampire than as a human. Keitel also manages a poignant moment, such as the scene where he insists that his kids kill him if and when he transforms into a vampire. <p>"From Dusk Till Dawn" is a cult film in the best sense of it: Either you'll love it, or you'll hate it. It's a stupid vampire flick in every sense of the word, which is why (except for the stripping) I guiltily enjoyed it. (Not for the weak of stomach)</p></body></html>

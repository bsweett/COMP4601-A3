<meta name="summary" content="Lots of fun and entertainment!  Love the clothes! (4 1/2 stars)"></head><body><p>I remember reading the novel by Lauren Weisberger and not being very impressed with it.  However, I heard wonderful things about the movie, and so I decided to give it a whirl.  The Devil Wears Prada is one entertaining surprise!  Andrea Sachs(Anne Hathaway) is a young woman who aspires to become a New York journalist.  But before she could do that, she has to settle for an assistant job at Runway magazine.  This is the job that every girl would kill for because it opens doors to many career opportunities.  The women who work there have to be chic, wear clothes no bigger than a size four and devoted fashionistas.  Which is why everyone is surprised when she is hired to be the second assistant to the infamous Miranda Priestley (Meryl Streep), editor-in-chief of Runway and a force to be reckoned with in the fashion industry.  Soon Andrea discovers what working for Miranda entails and that there is no pleasing the woman.  Her life is turned upside down and she's on the verge of losing her boyfriend and friends because her life is one-hundred percent devoted to her boss.  On the upside, she gets to wear lots of Chanel and Prada.<br /><br />I love how fun and entertaining this movie is.  I enjoyed Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci, but the one I enjoyed the most was the film's biggest star: fashion.  You get a wonderful backdrop of the fashion industry, fashion designers and the fashion magazine industry that is simply irresistible.  If you're not that into fashion, you will very likely be converted after watching this film (or at least you will become more conscious about the clothes you wear).  The outfits, purses and shoes shown here are beautiful and I wish I could afford to buy more Prada and Marc Jacobs.  I also loved the beautiful scenery of New York City and Paris (where Miranda and Andrea travel for fashion week).  The acting is also wonderful.  I'd seen Hathaway in The Princess Diaries and it was nice to see her in a more grown-up role.  Emily Blunt as the snooty English first assistant and Tucci as the sarcastic fashionista are fun as well.  But the best one without a doubt is Meryl Streep.  She once again proves why she's considered to be one of the best actresses of all time.  Her portrayal of Miranda Priestley is controlled and subtle.  Other actresses would taken the easy route with this role and have Miranda behave like a complete diva who shouts and snaps her fingers at people.  Meryl, however, played Miranda with a quiet confidence and elegant prose that made the character all the more intimidating and hateful.  The character itself is one-dimensional, as she was in the book, but Streep played her beautifully.  I cannot recommend The Devil Wears Prada enough.  If you were a big fan of Sex and the City and subscribe to Vogue magazine, this film is for you!</p></body></html>

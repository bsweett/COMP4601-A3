<meta name="summary" content="Held Up"></head><body><p>One of the great horror films.  A nice mix of chills and humor at all the right place.  The story finds 2 hikers in the English countryside when they are attacked.  One is killed, the other ends up with bites and scrapes, but still alive in a London hospital where he takes up with a nurse.  He is not sure what attacked them, but with regular visits from his dead friend and the next full moon, he finds out.  David Naughton of "Makin It" singing fame does a real good job with his role.  The werewolf change scene done long before CGI is still top notch.  This film holds up well in rewatch.  A worthy addition to any collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The greatest office comedy ever?"></head><body><p>I'm not sure it is essential to have worked in an office to enjoy this film, but I'm certain it will hit home for those who have.  The movie was a complete bust at the box office, which utterly mystifies me, because it is hysterically funny and reflects the experience of millions of people across the United States (and I assume elsewhere).  In an age where companies are seeking to lay off workers at any possible opportunity, this film has perhaps even more relevance now than it did when it came out in 1999.<p>The humor of the film works on multiple levels, but for me so much of it is funny with a twist of the knife, for much of the humor hints at a much more serious fact:  modern work is genuinely dreadful and alienating.  Perhaps many office workers love their job, but I hate mine, and I assume that I am merely one of millions.  No one in this film has a meaningful job.  Even Lumbergh, though the boss, has an absurd position.  Peter Gibbons is at least able to be honest about the ridiculousness of his plight during the incredibly funny sequence in which he is hypnotized.<p>The film is a collection of many, many wonderful moments.  I started laughing from the second that Peter Gibbons gets trapped in the traffic jam and is passed by an old man on a walker, and didn't stop until the very end.  The film is a parade of very funny bits, from Michael Bolton and his passion for gangsta rap to Joanna's boss urging her to wear more flair (played by director Mike Judge) to Peter's neighbor who would yell at him through the walls to Peter's bizarre fantasy in which Lumbergh is making love to Joanna holding a cup of coffee in one hand and her ankle in the other to virtually any conversation involving Lumbergh and Milton.  Some of the humor is a bit too broad.  For instance, although I defy anyone not to find Milton's sequences funny as heck, they don't fit in quite as neatly with the satire of the rest of the film.  I wouldn't, however, want to trade them in for a tighter movie.<p>In a way, this movie has made my life easier to live.  I suspected my job was absurd before seeing this film.  Now I know it is.  But somehow knowing the truth makes it easier to get through the day.</p></body></html>

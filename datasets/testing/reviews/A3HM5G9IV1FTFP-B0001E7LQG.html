<meta name="summary" content="An INTELLIGENT romantic comedy - go figure!"></head><body><p>I'm only 28, and yet I still really enjoyed and appreciated this film. Why? Because it's the first romantic comedy I've seen in a long time that I didn't find to be a complete insult to my intelligence. On a surface level, this film is about an aging playboy who's spent his life chasing youth and beauty, who inadvertently falls for the middle-aged, successful yet lonely mother of his current trophy girlfriend. However, beyond that premise, this film has lots to say about intimacy, romance, loneliness and love that I think people of any age can relate to. The script isn't perfect, but it is genuinely clever, thoughtful, and touching. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, both screen icons, give fantastic performances that carry the film. Diane Keaton is especially excellent: she has an amazing ability to display several complex emotions at once. All you need to do is look at her face to know exactly what her character is thinking and feeling. Overall, a smart and insightful comedy.</p></body></html>

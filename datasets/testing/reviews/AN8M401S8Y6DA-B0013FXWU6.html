<meta name="summary" content="A Satire?  A horror film based on actual events?  An idea I had.  DVD features."></head><body><p>A well shot film by Paul Thomas Anderson about the greed that fuels the oil business based loosely on Upton Sinclair's novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934568457">Oil</a>.  Sounds like a movie about history, so what's this nonsense of a horror movie based on actual events?  The title sounds like a horror film, is it that?  No.  The score is like something out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48WC">The Shining [Blu-ray</a>], could it be the mood?  No.<br />In 2007 I pre paid for my oil and did a budget plan with a local company, my rate was $2.59.  On May 1st 2008 I was sent my new contract to lock into the a rate of $3.84 which I had to return by May 30.  On May 22, 2008 I received another letter saying they had sold out of oil in record time and my contract was void and they would send out new information.  On June 3, 2008 I received the letter stating I could lock in for $4.29 a gallon, for the avg I need that is $326 a month and $3,586.000 a year.  And I have a new house and don't use that much heat in comparison to others.  Oh, before arriving home to get the letter in the mail I stopped to fill up my gas tank at over $4 a gallon.  I've just set the stage for some real life horror or satire depending on how you see the glass.  Paul Thomas Anderson knowingly or unknowingly creates a character in Plainview  that can be used as a metaphor to mock the ridiculousness or our current state or to show the true horror of it.  As for the title in a revolution there is usually blood.  Either way nobody is packing up the family and moving to Beverly because we couldn't afford the gas it would take us to get there.<br />Another horror film just in theory it reminded me of (again only in theory) is the highly criticized <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008191WO">The Amityville Horror</a> for it's being based on a true story.  Ghosts or not that family's financial fears are real and hit home.<br />MY IDEA:<br />I read an article that stated that Nascar is suffering because these die hard fans usually travel all over to see the races but with large vehicles and what not they cant' afford it.  So here it is.  The biggest gas guzzlers have to be race cars, so what if Nascar boycotted itself.  Went on strike.  Those guys make pretty decent money and their fans are die hard.  More people might watch Sportscenter then the news and it plays about 20 times a day and each time would cover such a story.  Perhaps maybe just a well known well off racer.  It's a theory which I'm sure someone could poke a ton of holes in.  I don't have the answers I'm just throwing out ideas.<br /><br />DVD Features:  (NONE)</p></body></html>

I had a boss just like Miranda who worked at a production company I was trying to start a career with.  She was snippy, egotistical, and somehow didn't realize that the 13th amendment had passed.  I lasted three weeks and cursed that lady out so bad she didn't sleep that night.  Andy lasted a long time and I don't understand how, but boy was I entertained to watch her go.  This movie is about a woman who is a little disappointed that she didn't immediately make it as the writer she wanted to be, so she makes due by trying to be a fashion assistant to a major fashion company.  Along the way, Andy meets kiss-ups, fashion extraordinaires, jacks up her social life, and learns how to dress.  I fell on the floor when she asked a caller to spell a certain clothing line--classic entertainment.  A college buddy of mine told me I'd like this movie but it initially didn't look all that interesting to me.  Boy, was I wrong.  I loved it, even all the crude moments when she called this obviously slim woman "the fat girl."  I thought Andy's boyfriend was adorable, was curiously entertained by the guy who kept calling Andy "Size 6," and sadly, started to understand why Miranda was the way she was.  A professional woman wears many hats, and sometimes she's not always pleasant.  What a treat this film was.</p></body></html>

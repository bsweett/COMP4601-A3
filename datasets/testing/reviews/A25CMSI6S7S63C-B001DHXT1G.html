I know it wasnt a masterpiece of film, but for an action all out superhero movie, this delivered. This was a great film for what it was meant to do and that is a roller coaster ride. Edward Norton was a great Banner and the Hulk looked better here. The Abomination was a cool Hulk villain. This had all sorts of inside jokes with references to Marvel,Lou Ferrigno,the late Bill Bixby. I found this better than IronMan,and on par with Indiana Jones & Hellboy 2. This is also better than the first Hulk movie. This is a sequel to a certain degree. As a fan of superhero movies, & a Hulk comic fan, I thoroughly enjoyed it</p></body></html>

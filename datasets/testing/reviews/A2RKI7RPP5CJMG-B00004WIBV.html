I've always enjoyed Burton's work, but I felt that he might have gone a little overboard with the second "Batman" flick.  In the case of the Headless Horseman, though, the liberties taken make the story that much more captivating.  As usual, Burton crams as much atmosphere as he can into this film.  You actually feel like you've been transported to the creepiest part of 1799.  Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Ichabod Crane.  He's a chicken, yet a brilliant mind lies under that facade.  Christina Ricci, as Katrina Van Tassel, is also perfectly cast, since she combines beauty, brains, and "goth" all into one.  Miranda Richardson is another standout as Katrina's wicked stepmother.  Jeffrey Jones, underrated since the dawn of time, has a smaller role in this flick, but his acting skills make his character shine.<br /><br />The special effects were excellent.  Christopher Walken, though all of his lines were grunts, grumbles, and one whispery, "Shhh!" was an excellent choice for the Horseman.  He was a walking, riding, head-whacking special effect all on his own.<br /><br />The story was great.  As stated before, Burton did take a few liberties with the story, but they made the film that much better.<br /><br />If you're looking for a little Halloween fun, or just want to get a little spooked any time of year, watch "Sleepy Hollow."  It has just enough scares in it to mess with the younger kids(though anyone under thirteen should probably steer clear of this one), just enough fight sequences for the action fan, and great acting coupled with a plotline that'll keep even the toughest critic at attention.</p></body></html>

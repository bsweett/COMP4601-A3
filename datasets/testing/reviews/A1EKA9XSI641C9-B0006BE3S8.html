<meta name="summary" content="Underwhelming"></head><body><p>Turn on the wipers because AvP just hit the windshield. 20th Century Fox has just mocked all of the fans of Alien and Predator.<br /><br />1979 - Alien hits theatres.  Groundbreaking.<br /><br />1986 - Aliens is released.  Even better than the original.<br /><br />1987 - Predator - An earthbound Alien.  A stunning blend of Action and Science Fiction.<br /><br />1990 - Predator 2 - Schwarzenegger is no where to be seen.  Audiences are underwhelmed.<br /><br />1992 - Alien 3 - The movie David Fincher set out to make is never released. Instead, a butchered version is sent to theaters.<br /><br />1997 - Alien Resurrection - What was once a great and dramatic trilogy is now a sci-fi popcorn movie for the average movie-goer.<br /><br />2004 - Alien vs. Predator - Since at least 1990 fans of Alien and Predator have wanted to see the two creatures face off on the big screen.  What us fans get is a mockery of the two franchises.  20th Century Fox had over 10 years to make AvP.  The movie that we finally got is embarrasing.</p></body></html>

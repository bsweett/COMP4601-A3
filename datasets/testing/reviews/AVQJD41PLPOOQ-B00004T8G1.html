<meta name="summary" content="One of my favorite horror movies (and there ain't many of them!)"></head><body><p>This classic horror film by John Carpenter speaks for itself in terms of atmospheric spookiness.  There aren't too many scary movies that take place in a coastal environment.<br /><br />I have a seasonal beach house that I keep open through October.  As Halloween gets closer each year, I love to watch this movie at my house with the lights turned out, knowing the beach, the ocean and maybe...the fog are right outside my door!<br /><br />Ooooooooh!!!</p></body></html>

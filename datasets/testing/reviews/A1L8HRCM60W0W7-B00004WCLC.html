Which is barely enough to make it worthwhile. <p>All the characters in the movie fumble through their tragic, unfulfilled existence and the theme couches a fairly depressing message -- that we always end up hurting the ones we really love. Whenever something unusual or magical happens, it is ineffective or downright silly (e.g., a rain of frogs -- don't ask!) <p>Worse, all this out-of-focus saga runs for a sprawling 3 hours. The music is so loud in most sequences that it drowns out the dialogue, what kind of a creative cinematic device was this if beyond me. The language is often of a streetside variety. <p>Oddly, one of the less important characters, Donnie (played by William Macy) says something interesting:  &quot;I really do have love to give...I just don't know where to put it.&quot; Which perfectly summarizes my sentiments for this farcical excuse for a film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="STAR WARS- A NEW HOPE (for Sci-Fi Cinema of the 70's)"></head><body><p>I saw the original STAR WARS-A NEW HOPE when it first came out in 1977. I rated it then as I do now an unconditional five stars.  I can't comment on the transfer quality of this particular DVD release as I own so many copies of this episode on RCA video disk, VHS tape, Pioneer Laser Disk and various issues of DVD that I get them mixed up.<br /><br />My ultimate STAR WARS-A NEW HOPE experience was my original screening in a great sound and extra large screen theater in CT in 1977. We simply were just not accustomed to that kind of sci-fi in 1977. It was as new and exciting a film as 2001 was in the late 60's. Shortly after seeing LOGAN'S RUN with my wife and being terrribly dissapointed with that film we went to see STAR WARS at the same theater. When we saw the opening of STAR WARS and the Imperial ship went overhead, my wife said "You can close your mouth now!", which just about sums it up.<br /><br />My second best STAR WARS-A NEW HOPE film experience was when I had the opportunity to screen an excellent 16 mm copy in a private theater in scope and beautiful color. It too was grand. I hope to purchase a HD-DVD or BLUE RAY copy of this film and see it on my 52" HDTV after the format battle is waged and won.</p></body></html>

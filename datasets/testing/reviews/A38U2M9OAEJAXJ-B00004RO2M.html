He was an unparalleled master of technique and form, releasing unequaled classics like "A Clockwork Orange," "2001," and "The Shining." But even great directors have at least one subpar movie in their resume, and this puppy is it. "Full Metal Jacket" is really two films blended into one. The first half is easily the more effective of the two. Here, we get an unflinching look at the day-to-day training of the Marines during the Vietnam war. The recruits are humiliated, verbally assaulted, and endure the most rigid of physical regimens. It's simultaneously unsettling and hilarious. But the minute these recruits go to war, it all goes downhill. This is quite possibly the first Kubrick movie that nearly put me to sleep. The war sequences are unexciting and perfunctory, and they pale in comparison to the rawness of the vastly superior Coppola masterpiece "Apocalypse Now." But there are definitely Kubrick touches that help make the film interesting. A lot of the photography recalls the clean and sterile images of "A Clockwork Orange." In addition, one scene, which looks like it could have been lifted from "The Shining," has the camera zoom into a recuit wearing the most demented facial expression. Kubrick diehards may want to give this a whirl, but if you're a fan of war movies, the final verdict is this: you've seen it all before. And better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another Burton Short Story Movie"></head><body><p>I own a few of Burton's films, and it's obvious he has no clear vision regarding the scope of his projects. Edward Scissor Hands, Sleepy Hollow, his version of Planet Of The Apes, The Corpse Bride, Beetle Juice are all basically small concepts forcibly stretched out into attempts at full movie scripts. So far the only film a value in a critical sense by him is Sweeney Todd... and that subject is basically hack material by now. I feel this is like most Burton movies, a little bit of his quirky style and not much else... no stand out acting, boring redundant Elfman soundtrack boys choir and all... "ooooo~ewwwww~oooooo~ahhhhhhh~haaaaaa~haaaaaa~oooooo"<br /><br />I doubt Burton has the capacity to conceive of anything of true substance having made countless films all revolving around cheap fluff material.</p></body></html>

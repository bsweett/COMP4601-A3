Don Cheadle gives an excellent performance as Samir Horn.  Cheadle is becoming one of the most interesting actors because his film selections have power such as the Oscar-winning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a> & his Oscar-nominated performance in "Hotel Rwanda."  Australia's Guy Pearce who was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C2IQR">The Hard Word</a> plays Ron Clayton, an agent who tracks Cheadle across continents.  Said Taghmaoui who was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMOW">Hidalgo (Widescreen Edition)</a> was nominated for "Best Breakout Performance" by Black Reel Awards for this film.  As Omar, the friend who is skeptical about Samir and then becomes his greatest champion, his performance is stirring.  Neal McDonough from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C5LLLY">88 Minutes</a> & TV's "Desperate Housewives" plays agent Max Archer like a thug.  Jeff Daniels plays an operative helping Samir.  Alyy Khan does a good job as the playboy Fareed Mansour.  Jeffrey Nachmanoff wrote the screen play for "Day After Tomorrow" and also directs this film.  There are enough twists in "Traitor" that one must pay close attention.  Ultimately, it makes you question whether all of us need to be on opposite sides.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

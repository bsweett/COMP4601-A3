<meta name="summary" content="What a pathetic piece of crap from a pioneer."></head><body><p>The film overall lacked ingenuity. People can say "oh how can you say that about what happened." IM NOT. I'm saying THE MOVIE Sucked. Sorry for the street word, but that is exactly how to describe it. Right from the beginning when the cops were being hauled from PA to downtown, there was no emotional creativity. The cut scenes were paltry and boring. SHOW THE TERROR Stone, don't candy coat it all mamsy-pamsey for the masses. What a sell out. Pathetic. A cut scene with a guy with a little soot on his double breast or another with a bleeding ear is really not well done. Let's see the horror. It was dull, boring and I don't know how The Academy or anyone rational can think Nick Cage is anything less than wooden and plastic in every Role he is in. He lacks any emotional creativity in all forms. It was not the Oliver Stone I expected and admired from Wall Street and Platoon. United 93 blew this film away in every aspect. In every way. WTC was Hollywood from jumpstreet. It was like a pre packaged deal at Walmart this film. What a total piece of garbage. I understand he is showing it from a different aspect entirely, but one wonders why it bombed in the box office and you can often get it here for 67 cents. There is a reason. It was awful, and it could have been phenomenal. What a shame.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant acting, breathtaking landscapes & music, touching"></head><body><p>This is a road movie about Ernesto "Che" Guevara, before his "political" times. Actually, it is fair to say that it depicts in a romantic way the road trip through the heart of South America that opened him up to the things to come later. He embarks on a 10K+ KM journey with his buddy Alberto Granado, riding "La Poderosa" (The Powerful One), an oil-leaking motorcycle, going from Argentina to Venezuela, through Chile, Peru and Colombia.<br /><br />The performance by Gael Garcia Bernal, once more, does not dissapoint, turning him into one of the most versatile (yet controversial) actors of this generation. The music by Gustavo Santaolalla is breathtaking, becoming a perfect match for the monumental South American landscapes (think Andes, Amazon river...). The movie as a whole leaves you feeling good in the end. Highly recommendable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent and engrossing movie"></head><body><p>I love Grisham and other similar legal thrillers, and greatly enjoyed movies like Class Action (with Gene Hackman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, etc.), The Verdict (Paul Newman, etc.), A Civil Action (John Travolta, etc.), Runaway Jury (again with Hackman, John Cusack, etc.), And Justice for All (Al Pacino) and other similar films so it was somewhat natural that I'd like Michael Clayton.  The only possible reason not to like the movie would be the fact that Clooney plays the lead character and I've grown a bit tired of him.<br /><br />Michael Clayton is a great film.  Well worth the time to watch.  It's tense, and engrossing and will draw you into the events that unfold on the screen in front of you.  120 minutes that fly by quickly and never seem to drag.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that the disc is incredibly light on extras.  A total of 3 deleted scenes (6 minutes worth, give or take) and audio commentary that is pretty boring really.  I'm not sure what else I was expecting, and really, as good as the film is, I don't feel like I was owed anything else... but, I wish there was more here to see.<br /><br />The lack of extras make it a bit hard to recommend as a purchase, but it is most definitely worth viewing.  Unbox it, buy it used, rent it, whatever.  Just watch it.</p></body></html>

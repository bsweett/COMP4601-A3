Or in this case, rain and dogs!<p>But the real problem with this flick is this - we dont know the bad guys. One particular character, advertised as the fastest gunhand in the west or whatever, makes about a 30 second appearance at the end of the movie just to get shot between the eyes. And the evil cattle baron has one scene in the beginning of the film, and then again comes back to get killed. And, since we were deprived of the &quot;bar fight&quot; that landed the big guy in the pokie, we basically are rewarded with a central conflict that seems somewhat arbitrary and as empty as a box full of air.<p>Robert Duvall was terrific and obviously very comfortable in these roles and gets an 'A' for character development, but then there's Costner's character Charlie....we dont know a whole lot about him and that's too bad. I guess he was intended to remain a mystery but to tell the audience he had a &quot;violent past&quot; and leave it at that is a major disappointment. The audience doesnt know enough about Costner's character to by sympathetic. And although Annette Benning was very good, and gorgeous as usual, there is absolutely zero spark between her character and Charlie. The final scene in the saloon is almost unbearable. Ms. Benning looks like she's in pain as she says &quot;I've been holding my love for a long time Charlie.&quot; Ouch!<p>And then there's the big climactic gunfight that is a carnival of people and bullets that refuses to end. It just goes on and on while you're impatiently tapping your feet and looking at your watch and it still goes on for another ten minutes of irrelevant nonsense. Sheesh, give it up already!<p>You know, I really wanted to like this movie, and I tried to be objective knowing what I know about Costner's style and devotion to his personal brand of noble sentimentality and detachment, but....it's just not there. &quot;We're not ourselves yet!&quot; Yeah, no kidding.<p>The DVD package is well put together. The photography is amazing, and the 5.1 sound is very good, although the gunfire sounds a bit hollow in spots. Audio commentary, a &quot;making of&quot; documentary, and plenty of deleted scenes for those of you who find yourself all that curious about this thing. Also a boring music video that I suppose is designed to be some sort of tribute to Kevin Costner's genius as a director. Like I said, it just ain't there. 3 Yorkies.</p></body></html>

Braddock, the rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-riches heavyweight world boxing champion of the mid-1930s is among Russell Crowe's finest work. A real Horatio Alger story full of inspiration and good old fashioned values, CINDERELLA MAN is full of fine performances, especially those by Renee Zellweger (as Mae, Jim Braddock's Wife) and Paul Giamatti (as Jim's Manager/Trainer/Promoter/Friend Joe Gould).<br /><br />When the story opens in 1928, Jim is climbing quickly to the top of the boxing world. But physical injuries stall his career. Unable to box, Jim and his family have no choice but to face the full rigors of the Great Depression. He cannot find any more than shift work for pennies. A proud man, Jim at first refuses to go on the dole, but circumstances force it. Jim is humbled.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard's phenomenal presentation of Depression Era life in a northeastern winter is poignant and troubling, especially in these awful economic times of 2010. The power of the performances as the quietly stubborn Mae refuses to give in to complete despair and Jim refuses utterly to abandon hope in the face of nightmarish living conditions and breadlines, are both emotionally moving.<br /><br />Joe Gould, who has quietly lost everything as well, comes to Jim with a fight, as a "throwaway" against the Number Two-ranked boxer for a small fee, which Jim, shockingly, wins handily.<br /><br />Jim begins a steady climb to the top again, becoming the hero of the "little guy" along the way. At the very top, he is matched against the famed World Champion Max Baer, a colorful, Hollywoodish man who has accidentally killed men in the ring. He beats Baer by Decision.<br /><br />CINDERELLA MAN errs in portraying Baer as a monstrous, ill-mannered man who taunts Jim about Mae and sets out to cripple him during the fight. Baer was a big, tough man, and he was no periwinkle; but nowhere but here has he been caricatured as a homicidal maniac. Every heroic film needs a bad guy, but Baer was not, in truth, an evil guy.<br /><br />Except for this unfortunate bit of misreportage which costs it points, CINDERELLA MAN is a pleasure to watch. A paean to hope, love and family, it is a film in the good old fashioned vein, a story of adversities overcome and dreams realized, a film that restores its audience.</p></body></html>

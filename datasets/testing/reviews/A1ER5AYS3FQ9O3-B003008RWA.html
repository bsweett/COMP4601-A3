<meta name="summary" content="Well worth seeing and my firsthand experience supports many of his points"></head><body><p>This film highlights a subject that many of us intuitively understand or have experienced through the years - our health care system is in crisis and it can be a struggle to get claims covered, even if you have decent insurance. For those without insurance, it is a horror story.<br /><br />I related to this movie because I know that simply keeping track of the paperwork and communicating between the doctors and the insurance company takes a great deal of my time. It didn't used to. Something, indeed, has changed for the worst.<br /><br /> For one thing, companies often delay payments until a patient's credit rating is in peril or impacted. I have seen friends have to bug insurance companies, in spite of the fact that they are paying premiums to these companies, to pay on time even when paperwork is properly submitted. This should not be. The company should be doing its job, insuring those who need their services, paying for appropriate medical care. People should not have to have their credit rating jeopardized or have to make a choice between paying the high costs themselves, somehow, even if they are financially stressed to the max...and then hope the insurance company will reimburse them..someday.<br /><br />  Listen to Linda Peeno's admission that she denied a patient proper care in spite of the fact that she knew this could cause death and that she continued to deny care in order to help a company maximize its profits - and she did so again and again, with encouragement and support by the company. I hope this will give you pause.<br /><br />  As far as personal experience goes, I left a hospital emergency room after being told nothing was seriously wrong with me. A nurse had checked the box that indicated they'd looked at the injection site where they'd taken blood and left a "tap" in case they needed to get medication into me quickly. I was instructed not to removed the gauze over the site till I got home. Imagine my surprise to discover they'd left two needles in me, taps fully in place! I actually took them out myself. So why did they check the box indicating they'd done it and that I'd been fully cleared to leave. I did negotiate a reduction on my bill but this certainly did nothing to make me feel more confident about the care I got that day. It was a minor mistake but how many more people suffer greater ones?<br /><br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IMVO5K">Breakdown: America's Health Insurance Crisis</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061145823">What You Don't Know Can Kill You: A Physician's Radical Guide to Conquering the Obstacles to Excellent Medical Care</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401895956">Understanding Health Insurance: A Guide to Billing and Reimbursement</a></p></body></html>

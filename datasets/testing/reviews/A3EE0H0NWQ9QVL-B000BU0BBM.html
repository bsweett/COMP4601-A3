Stunning visually and occasionally funny, this madcap farce could have been great.  Heath Ledger and Matt Damon give spirited performances as Wil and Jacob Grimm.  Furthermore, the cinematography is beautifully illuminating, and the scenes are filled with cliff-hanging adventure.  So why doesn't it all work?<br /><br />The components are all top quality, but it doesn't really come together.  There are even two plots skillfully interwoven:  The Brothers Grimm are kidnapped at a local pub by French soldiers and are conscripted to save an enchanted forest.  The vignettes of the fairy tales then work their way loosely into the main plot.  The effect is not unlike a Mel Brook's movie.  Gilliam and company do to the Grimm's fairy tales what Brooks did to the Frankenstein movies (in 'Young Frankenstein') or to Hitchcock (with 'High Anxiety'), except it seldom works right.  They also draw from other sources, making the inspiration of Grimm's 'Fairy Tales' much the way 'Shakespeare in Love' did for Shakespeare's plays.  It's a good premise to borrow from, but the execution also falls flat.  The film also remains true to the absurd Monty Python tradition, but these elements  often come off as forced and arbitrary.  There are bizarre elements as well, but this, too, is done in a random fashion.  (There is, for instance, an odd predilection for creepy insects that appear throughout the movie that seem unconnected to anything else that happens.)  Also, the sibling rivalry from the brother's relationship could have provided entertaining banter.  Instead, we get wit that wouldn't remind one of the weakest moments from the TV series 'Frazier'; and the slapstick is slapdash--nothing that would make it on the Cartoon Network.  If they did the whole affair straightforward, they would have made a magnificent movie.  But, in all fairness, one should judge a film by what it is rather than what it could have been.  True enough.  As a farce or as a weird trek, it fails.  Gilliam's brilliant work 'Brazil' illustrates why this movie pales in comparison--even though the special effects are matchless next to any other Python work. As an offbeat adventure, it also falls short.  The only thing that does work is the traditional adventure and enchantment.  They could have fixed the film in two ways:  If the writing were far better caliber, they would have made a movie par with the 'Bullwinkle' series, but as a grander spectacle, of course.  Their only other recourse was to play it straight and build an exciting adventure with a few, selective laughs thrown in.  And, with the ending, they almost pulled it off--instead it comes together with too many elements that don't work together.  The whole affair seems haphazard.  This is an admirable effort, but the shortcomings provide too many disappointments. (**1/2)</p></body></html>

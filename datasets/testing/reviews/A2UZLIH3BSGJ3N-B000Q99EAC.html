<meta name="summary" content="A fitting end to the life of a boxer"></head><body><p>Sylvester Stallone returns to star and direct the finale to his Rocky boxing saga.Essentially all of the Rocky films summarized as the evoloution of the life of a boxer,from his prime,ups and downs and to his retired years. Rocky is drawn back into the life of boxing and to come out of retirement in an exibition match between himself and the current champ Mason Dixon.Through the years Rocky has run the gammet.His hard climb from his humble beginings to get into the professional boxing world,his rise to the top and bitter falls.Rocky has always been the underdog,pitted against opponents who seem to shrink him in skill and stature,but with a steel will and drive of a champion he always emerged victorious.Current day, Rocky is back in his old neigborhood living his life.The owner of a resturaunt in tribute to his wife Adrian who died of cancer a few years before,trying to deal with his estranged relationship with his son and not to mention his rough relationship with Paulie.Needless to say,Rocky has allot of untied ends,or as he puts it,"stuff in the basement".Due to a computer simulated match seen on ESPN,Mason Dixon is talked into proposing a match between himself and Balboa to beef up his reputation which has deminished.Rocky gets to thinking on his own he'd like to box again,and with an opportunity such as this,he can't resist.Hard training begins and as Rocky builds himself up for his triumphant return,you can't help be reminess of the good 'ol days.The fight begins and all the way to its final round(and to everyone's surprise)Rocky (who was the pun of everyones jokes) goes the distance and shows all that "heart" will take you all the way.I was pleasently surprised with Stallone's final film and the depicted life of Rocky Balboa.It was a very honest,genuine,down to earth portrayal of the life of a boxer dealing with his struggles.This isn't a fast paced action film,and does move a little slow and perhaps for a few instances,a bit sappy here and there.If you look beyond the obvious,Rocky Balboa delivers an honest performance of one of the greatest fictional comebacks of a professional athlete one will ever see.You have to hand it to Stallone,for a man who is 60 years of age,he was in phenominal shape for this performance.Something I expect that most everyone wishes they could be also.So,with a few friends,do a movie night with all the Rocky films and,"Get ready to rumble" with Rocky one last time.</p></body></html>

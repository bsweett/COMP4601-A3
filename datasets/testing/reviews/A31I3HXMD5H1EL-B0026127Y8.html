<meta name="summary" content="Flashy Homage to Genre with Powerhouse Neeson Performance..."></head><body><p>The premise of a kidnapped child rescued by an incredibly skilled father has become something of a film genre over the past three decades, with the parent usually portrayed by an action movie icon (Bruce Willis, Charles Bronson, John Wayne, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example). The latest addition to the category, "Taken", treads on familiar ground, but succeeds in breathing fresh life into the concept through the unusual casting of Liam Neeson as a retired special ops agent; eschewing glamor for gritty determination, Neeson is so good that the film becomes a homage to not only the genre, but to a father's devotion to his child in an increasingly dangerous world.<br /><br />Neeson is clearly a dinosaur, not only among the flashy, media-savvy operatives of the intelligence community, but as a parent, as well; his over-protectiveness of his daughter is scoffed at by his ex-wife (Famke Janssen), and his ongoing surveillance has a nearly creepy quality. Yet when his instructions are ignored, and his daughter is abducted by a white slavery ring in France, Neeson quickly proves himself to be their worst nightmare, a relentless, unforgiving adversary.<br /><br />While a legitimate argument can be made that the story's resolution is too 'sugar-coated' and pat, it does provide an optimism that is too often lacking in recent films, and I enjoyed it...<br /><br />"Taken" is a terrific suspense film, and certainly worth owning, especially if you're a Liam Neeson fan!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not much to say...."></head><body><p>I'm still waiting for Pixar to make a bad movie.<br />It hasn't happened yet.<br /><br />Toy Story 3?<br />Excellent animation, pacing, acting, score, voice acting etc...<br />A great way to wrap up the trilogy.<br /><br />The bad?<br />It does seem to drag a little in the middle and the human characters still grate on my nerves.<br />Yes, like everyone else I shed a tiny tear at the end.<br />Not nearly as adult oriented and tear jerky as "UP" but still a great film and a great ending to the franchise.<br /><br />Toy Story comes...highly recommended.</p></body></html>

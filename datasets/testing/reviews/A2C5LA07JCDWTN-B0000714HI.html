The film is funny but not half as funny as it's predecessor The Spy who Shagged Me or a tenth as funny as the original. Still, Mike Myers is a funny man with great comedic instincts. In addition to his gaggle of demented characters (Dr. Evil ...), Myers adds Goldmember to the list. Goldmember is a dutch hedonist from the '70's who likes roller skating and eating his own peeling skin but loves gold. Myers as always is at his best when running wild as these crazy alter-ego's. Seth Green's Scott Evil character gets less screen time in Goldmember but he is much more effective. If there is another Austin Powers, there is no doubt that Green's role will be expanded. I will say this, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is by far the hottest chick that Myers has used in these films. When she's on the screen you can't take you're eyes off of her. She also does a good job of acting(but really who cares!). Watching Goldmember as a fan of the series and Myers, the laughs are beginning to get strained which is sad because the original was so inspired. Anyway, if you're a fan go see it but don't expect anything more than a re-hash of the first two movies. Recommended for hard-core fans only.</p></body></html>

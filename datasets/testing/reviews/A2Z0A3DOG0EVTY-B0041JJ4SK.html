<meta name="summary" content="*1/2 Stars-A Good Idea Spoiled By Stupid People......."></head><body><p>I remember it quite well. I was in Los Angeles taking some film classes and interning. It was a great experience filled with a lot of awesome adventures. But with all the fun I was having I still longed for home.<br /><br /> See I hail from the Garden State. Lived there all my life, and if there's one delicacy that cannot be found anywhere else, It's the WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER. I salivate just thinking about it.<br /><br /> And there I was in the Hollywood Hills craving one. I went down to the little store that was in my Apartment complex and there they were Frozen White Castle's just waiting to be devoured. I greedily bought a box and was in Heaven for a small moment as I savored them.<br /><br /> Cut to the present. A weird promotional pack shows up on my desk at work. It's for a movie called HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE. It also featured a map of their intrepid Journey from New Brunswick, NJ to Cherry Hill, NJ to get the sweet nectar that is a WHITE CASTLE hamburger. I was intrigued. Here was the kind of movie that, if done well, could keep me happy for weeks and craving those awesome burgers.<br /><br /> HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE star Kal Penn (Van Wilder) and John Cho (American Wedding) as two stoner's with the munchies. It just so happens that a White Castle commercial is on TV, so they decide to go. Little do they know that they're about to go on the Road Trip of a life time.<br /><br /> Man am I mad. This is a great premise for a movie. Unlike some, I always liked the road movie, because I like the weird characters the characters met. I also like when basic concepts are blown completely out of proportion. Plus it's set in Jersey, that's always a good thing. HAROLD AND KUMAR tries to give you weird and wacky characters, and it tries to make a small concept into a high concept and fails in the attempt.<br /><br /> Come on people, New Jersey is one of the Strangest states in the Union. Don't believe me, check out WEIRDNJ.COM. A magazine the chronicles the states local legends and wild characters. The state is a character in and of itself. Between the Jersey Devil, The Klan and Satanists in the woods, the best they could come up with was Jamie Kennedy peeing in a bush? or Doogie Howser stealing a car? Every joke felt like a cop out, there is nothing of value in this truly stupid film except for Christopher Meloni's Freakshow. Now he was funny.<br /><br /> (As a side note, there is no such thing as SELF-SERVE GAS in NJ. So to put a sign up at a gas station that says Self Serve in this movie is just stupid.)<br /><br /> Director Danny Leiner hasn't learned the lessons of DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? The same regurgitated joke over and over does not a funny movie make and just because your movie is successful doesn't mean its good. HAROLD AND KUMAR, like DUDE is full of potentially funny stuff, and yet plays better on paper than on the screen.<br /><br /> For instance I think it's funny to read in a screenplay &quot;and Doogie Howser steals a car&quot;. But to watch it on the screen, you say so what? There is potential comedy there but no payoff. I'll bet they had a lot of fun making this movie, but probably gasped when they saw the final product.<br /><br /> Of course I didn't walk into this movie thinking that it was the second coming of CITIZEN KANE. But I walked in hoping to laugh A LOT and I didn't. You can make a stupid, vapid, piece of camp (or crap), but if it's not funny, it's not worth the time or effort. Danny Leiner you wasted my time, you wasted the studio's money, and you should be horrified by your crappy movie.<br /><br /> HAROLD AND KUMAR is like the feeling you get after you've finished a couple dozen WHITE CASTLE'S, your stomach aches and you say to yourself &quot;man I shouldn't have done that&quot;. You then spend the rest of the afternoon on the toilet. Do me favor go to the restaurant enjoy the burgers and skip the movie. You'll be happy you did.<br /><br /> *1/2 (out of 5)</p></body></html>

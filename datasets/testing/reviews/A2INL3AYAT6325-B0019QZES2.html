<meta name="summary" content="Better film than the 1st GOOD, not perfect film"></head><body><p>I Like this film better than the 1st.<br />Why.  Adding Dustin Hoffman & Barbra Streisand.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Barbra's but she & Dustin were great in their roles to me.  Added with DeNiro 3 Oscar winners.<br />The 3 of them with Blythe Danner are perfect in their roles.<br /><br />Teri Polo has a role that is just a watcher of course.<br />Now, I am NOT a fan of Ben Stiller.  He does his usual routine in this role as he did in the 1st & in "There's Something About Mary".  Same lying, put out then blows his top role.  Wish they could have gotten a better actor for the role.<br />And, we MOST DEFINITELY could have done WITHOUT Owen Wilson in both films.<br /><br />As for the DVD, it is a good package.  I like extras  & this one has the kind I like.  Deleted scenes, bloopers, etc.<br /><br />A BIG MINUS FOR THE DVD, IT HAS THE HORRIBLE LITTLE FLIP OPEN FLAPS ON IT.<br /><br />Otherwise, you should enjoy the film.</p></body></html>

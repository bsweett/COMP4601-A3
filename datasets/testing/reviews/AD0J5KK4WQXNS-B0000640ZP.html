<meta name="summary" content="Television Movie Quality with Twilight Zone Themes"></head><body><p>The Others is a good movie that unfortunately can not hold out its 104 minute running time because of the confines of the twist - that we have seen before. Comparisons will be made to certain other horror twist vehicles that did the circuit around the same time as this movie.<p>The problem with these twist films is that the entire weight of the picture is balancing on that twist. This means that the film can not really extend past those boundaries of what that has to offer. In one scene Nichole Kidman leaves her home only to be enveloped in a fog and she must return back to where she came from. That pretty much sums up what is on display here.<p>Nichole Kidman plays a somewhat wealthy land owner whose husband has not returned from the war, her kids can not go near sunlight, her servants have left her and she is trying to keep everything together. When most of the film has played itself out to establish everything in the first twenty minutes it does not really go anywhere else until the climax. The film mostly repeats itself - Kidman acts desperately to keep control, the new servants act strange, the house is haunted. The material is recycled over and over again but this is what we usually expect from films that hang onto that twist as the final affirmation that will effectively blow out our candle.<p>Overall the twist does work but is nothing that you have not seen before if you have seen other types of these themes. The acting from Kidman is quite good but everyone else is a little under par including Christopher Eccleston's performance. It all looks very stage-like and has more television appeal than DVD or the cinema screen. In fact it works better as something you switch onto after seeing the news. This would be a more apt market niche for it than mainstream cinema and it plays better as a Television movie. It is more along that "quality" of film making than what the A-list leading lady suggests.<p>This is a good horror yarn and a nice Ghost story, but not spectacular cinema, powerhouse performing or the brilliant film as some may tout. It is just good but nothing new or original. It does boost a few scares but these can be handled by most teenagers or anyone above the 12 age group category.... maybe even some people below that age. It really depends on your kids but I know plenty that watched it and enjoyed it and still went to sleep that night. There is no blood or violence in this horror movie which is good. Like I said it is more akin to an episode of the Twilight Zone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Masterpiece of a Masterpiece"></head><body><p>Talk about the legacy of acting legend Gregory Peck.  This compelling actor played two of the most iconic characters in all of cinematic lore--<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AUKA">Captain Ahab</a> and Atticus Finch.  (And Peck played both roles in his own unique, creative style.)  With respect to Atticus Finch, Peck merely enhances an extraordinarily good film, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, based on Harper Lee's phenomenal and timeless <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061120081">novel</a>.  I've read the book and seen the movie, many times; experiencing both are extremely rewarding.  In particular, the film works marvelously, for several reasons.<br /><br />For openers, Horton Foote penned a riveting screenplay, while director Robert Mulligan brings Lee's novel to vivid life.  The film is blessed with very believable child actors in Mary Badham (Scout) and Phillip Alford (Jem), who both made their silver screen debuts.  The supporting cast is spectacular, including a grisly, disheveled James Anderson playing villain Bob Ewell and a very young Robert Duvall playing reclusive Boo Radley.  Add to that Peck's commanding performance as a widowed lawyer and father of two children in the Jim Crow South during the Great Depression, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a movie for the ages.  Highly recommended for all movie collectors and cinema buffs.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

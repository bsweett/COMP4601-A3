<meta name="summary" content="THE BEST SUPERMAN FILM TO DATE!"></head><body><p>I saw this film in theaters way back in '78! I loved it then and it holds up quite well today. The FX are great for the time and for the most part look fine. Reeve's gave Clark Kent/Superman so much character and to me he will always be Superman. This is a very entertaining film and it's doesn't take itself too seriously. Lots of humor and terrific performances by all the key players.<br /><br />If I have one or two complaints it's that the Superman and Lois flying sequence is too long and I didn't like the whole "turning back time" segment at the end. I would have liked to have the movie spend a little more time on Clark's youth too. These are small grievances and I love this film regardless giving it 4 1/2 stars. It's a shame that 'Superman Returns' didn't have this much charm. I am reviewing this film on the individual release, but own and watched the newer Superman box set.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I know I'm human and some of you are human or you'd all jump me right now" McReady(Kurt Russell)"></head><body><p>I saw this one when it came out and have this one on my top 10 list of favorite horror movie. While it is true the effects are stunning and have yet to be matched, it is with repeat viewing that the better parts of the movie rise to the top.<br />  This is a more accurate telling of the short story classic"Who Goes There?" which was the used to make the original "Thing". In that one we had a monster from outer space that was described as a "Carrot", while here we go back to the idea that the alien can assume the shape of anything it touches. This is where the movie gets it's scariest scenes from, you never know who is on your side or who is an alien.<br />  The cast is great and once again Kurt Russell shows that he is a very fine actor and carry's this film. This is one that stays with you long after the movie is over.</p></body></html>

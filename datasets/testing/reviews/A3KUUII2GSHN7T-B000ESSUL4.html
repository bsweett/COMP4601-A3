<meta name="summary" content="Another Malick "love it or hate it" film."></head><body><p>It's clear to me now that most anyone who watches a Terrence Malick film cannot remain bipartisan in their final assessment of his work. Simply put, people either love his films or they loathe them. For those of us who love symbolism, deeply meditative sequences of sound and imagery, or poetic cinematography, the New World will again act as an ample supply to fulfill your lust for films less ordinary.<br /><br />PLOT:<br />This is the story of Pocahontas and John Smith portrayed in a style you've never seen before. Smith arrives in 17th century Jamestown upon a ship and is sentenced to die, but his sentence is revoked when Smith's importance to the survival of the new colony is acknowledged. He isn't safe from the surrounding "naturals", however, and soon finds himself on the verge of death again until young Pocahontas saves his life.<br />The two quickly develop a platonic friendship in which they innocently teach one another words from each other's native tongue, and roam the landscape in type of otherworldly, cherubic flight of tranquility. Smith, feeding his constant wanderlust, eventually leaves Pocahontas, who at this point has been abandoned by her tribe for placing Smith above her people. She remains at the Anglo settlement and begins adopting their customs and culture. It is here that Pocahontas meets John Rolfe and eventually marries him, adopting the Anglo name of Rebecca. But the memory, and presence, of Smith are not completely evaporated and a final reunion seems imminent.<br /><br />The New World is just as much about the spiritual bond of family as it is the ideal relationship between Smith and Pocahontas. The young native woman at times questions where her dead mother has gone, and in the last hauntingly beautiful segment of the film, finally realizes that all of us live on in our children.<br /><br />There are a number of breathtaking scenes in which Malick intertwines natural beauty and a series of pensively symbolic imagery. Outside a battle scene towards the middle of the film, The New World is remarkably clean and lacks any type of romantic sensuality between Smith and Pocahontas. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has interest in the story or to anyone who enjoys well-crafted films.</p></body></html>

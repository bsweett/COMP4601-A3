<meta name="summary" content="You Can't Stop The Beat"></head><body><p>Having been a long-time fan of the original, I approached this DVD with some trepidation. After all, Divine and Rikki Lake both created iconic characters in the John Water's original 1988 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RZ9Y">Hairspray</a>, and John Travolta's association with the homophobic cult of Scientology made me nervous about how Edna would be portrayed. Imagine both my surprise and delight when one of the most affecting song and dance numbers in the new movie (adapted from the Broadway play adapted from the original movie...) was Travolta and Christopher Walken soft-shoeing to "You're Timeless to Me."<br /><br />That is how surprisingly good this humorously gentle take on race and social politics in the early sixties is. It marks one of the few movie musicals to have successfully navigated the transition from play to screen this decades (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLSE">Chicago</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QZ7U">Moulin Rouge</a> come to mind) as opposed to the ones that couldn't (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1YVZU">Rent</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBKMG">The Producers</a>). So much so that Hairspray 2007 is a better movie that Hairspray 1998. It may irk some purists to see that, as many of the one star Amazon reviews have indicated, but I see this movie as a potential classic comedy ala <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSW">South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut</a>. Having Waters himself make a deliciously tacky cameo in the opening number indicates that he was more than happy to help this movie come to life.<br /><br />What helps is the pitch-perfect cast. Starting with new discovery Nikki Blonsky, who makes the Rikki Lake part of Tracy all her own. As she struggles to overcome her limitations and dance her way onto The Corny Collins Show, she meets new friends and new enemies (Velma von Tussle - Michelle Pfeiffer reprising Debbie Harry's role as a nasty queen-bee). But Tracy's new friends teach her the best dances, get her noticed by teen-heartthrob Linc (Zac Efron, seeming to channel another John Waters actor from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009IOR6Q">Cry Baby,</a>, one Johnny Depp), and get her on the brink of becoming Miss Hairspray.<br /><br />As things become complicated and Tracy realizes that doing the right thing can be more important than winning a prize, the trademark Waters irreverent humor kicks into high gear. While Waters' involvement in the movie/play was as consultant and ultimately signing his approval, the screenplay by Leslie Dixon is so close in tone that you'd never know otherwise. And the songs by Mark Shaiman, Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan are tongue in cheek beauty. The closest musicals of recent vintage this even compares to are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RF8J">Little Shop of Horrors</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSW">South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut</a> (whose "Mountain Town" opening number seems a close cousin to Tracy's "Good Morning Baltimore"). The positive message delivered through the uplifting music and great performances (even minor roles, like Queen Latifah, Elijah Kelly, Amanda Bynes and Jerry Stiller -- returning from the original movie! -- are note-perfect) make this one of 2007's best summer movies; heart and soul instead of boom and bang.</p></body></html>

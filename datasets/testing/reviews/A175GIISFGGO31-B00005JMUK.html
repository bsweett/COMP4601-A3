I mean Charlize was that good....she WAS Aileen.<br /><br />  Of course this movie chronicles infamous serial killer Aileen Wurnos' trail of mayhem.....tremendous performances throughout and of course the topper was Theron.  A well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress...she obviously did her homework on Aileen and it shows big time.  She deserves it.<br /><br />  So take a look at it....Therons performance is astonishing.</p></body></html>

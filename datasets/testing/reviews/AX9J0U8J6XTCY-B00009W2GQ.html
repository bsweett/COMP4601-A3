INSTALLMENT EVERY BIT AS GREAT AS THE MATRIX WAS IT MAY BE EVEN BETTER!  THE WAR SEGMENT RANKS WITH THE BEST OF THE STAR WARS SCENES, AND NEO FINALLY GETS THE FREEDOM AND PEACE HE SO STRONGLY DESERVED!  WHAT A GREAT, THOUGHT PROVOKING CLIMAX-I SAT THERE STUNNED FOR 2 HOURS!  DO NOT MISS REVOLUTIONS ON DVD IT IS A KEEPER! AND THE PICTURE QUALITY AND THAT INCREDIBLE AC-3 DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND-IT ALL SOUNDS ANDS LOOK LIKE A SUPERBIT! NO EXPENSES WERE SPARED HERE TO GIVE US THE THRILLING AND UNPREDICTABLE CLIMAX IN THE BEST POSSIBLE QUALITY.  BRAVO AND THANKS TO ALL CONCERNED.  WHEW I AM STILL ENNERVATED!</p></body></html>

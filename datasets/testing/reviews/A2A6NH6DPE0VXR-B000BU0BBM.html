<meta name="summary" content="Not Terry Gilliam's best but still enchanting and fun"></head><body><p>I was looking forward to this film the second I heard about it since I'm a Terry Gilliam (Time Bandits, Brazil, 12 Monkeys) fan. I chickened out of seeing it in theatres since their was so many bad reviews. Now that I've seen it, I'm glad I did because it's really not that bad. It's not as good as a lot of Gilliam's other films but it's still a fun movie. I have an active imagination, so a movie like this is a dream come true to me. It takes a whole bunch of fairy tales and turns it into one enchanting horror/fantasy. It's sort of how Van Helsing takes all the classic monsters and puts them in one movie.<br /><br />  Matt Damon and Heath Ledger star as two brothers who fake battles with friends dressed up like monsters just to make some money. Soon though, they find themselves up against the real thing. They are sent on a mission to rescue captured children. Not just any children though, most of them you may recognize from classic stories such as Little Red Riding Hood. Ledger is the driving force of the movie. He believes in magic and happy endings and his brother played by Damon, just thinks he's an idiot. When their mom was sick when they were little, he sells the cow for magic beans instead of money that would pay for her doctor. Before he can plant the beans, Damon knocks them out of his hands and calls him an idiot. So when they're older, Damon still holds that against him. Damon trys hard and is good here but surprisingly Ledger steals the show. Ledger had a great year, he showed the entire year that he's not just a pretty face but also an excellent actor. He does that here as well. He'll probably even be nominated for an oscar this year and he deserves it.<br /><br />  The movie is a little mean spirited with how each child is taken and it's sort of disturbing. It could turn-off some viewers. Plus the film doesn't know if it's a comedy, fantasy or horror film. So that can make it a bit of a mess.The violence is a little too graphic and mean to be funny. The kid being swallowed by a horse in one scene for instance, is just creepy. Still though, it is pretty creative. The whole film is creative and that's what I like about it. I respect all the work and thought that goes into a film like this. That's why unlike some people, I just don't give out one star or even 2 unless the film is just too horrible to sit through. In that case I don't think the film is even worth writing about. After seeing the Brothers Grimm though, I couldn't wait to write a review for it. It's a little clunky with how it's put together but it's still a fun movie. Plus if you could sit through Van Helsing and actually like it, then you should love this. This is a Terry Gilliam film we're talking about here...not a Stephen Sommers film after all.</p></body></html>

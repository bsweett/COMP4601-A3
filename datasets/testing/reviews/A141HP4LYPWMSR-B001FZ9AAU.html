Michael Downey Jr. delivers a masterful performance in the role of Tony Stark, former weapons prodigy and multi-millionaire playboy who sees the error of his way and decides to do all he can to undo the damage wrought upon the world by his destructive creations. His call to action takes the former of Iron Man, a metal clad crusader who's all but impervious to conventional weaponry, has the ability to fly at supersonic speeds and comes equipped with the best technology of the day to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. I also enjoyed Gwyneth Paltrow as his long-time executive assistant and future love interest. The chemistry between the two was palpable and believable.<br /><br />Yes, `Iron Man' receives high marks across the board; strong storyline, wonderful performances, crisp and witty dialogue along with a heart-pounding soundtrack that will leave you anxiously awaiting the sequel. A number of previous reviews have made the statement that the special effects don't live up to expectations. I'm not an effects expert, but it sure looked awfully spectacular to me! My Rating: -5 Stars-.</p></body></html>

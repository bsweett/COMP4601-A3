<meta name="summary" content="The funniest movie of 2004!"></head><body><p>Two stoner buddies whom one is a Korean business investor named "Harold" ( John Cho) and a lazy Indian ( Kel Penn) have nothing to do but smoke weed and crack until they suddenly crave for munchies to find the perfect food. A commercial for a "White Castle" restraunt catches their eyes then they go on a crazy road trip to Cherry Hill Virgina to seek the tender hamburgers, but sometimes they make some stops like college, bump into Neil Patrick Harris, deal with some holligans and more.<br /><br />A hilarious, sometimes tasteless but creative comedy in the tradition of "Family Guy" and " Planes Trains and Automobiles" from the writer and director of " Dude, where's my Car?". There is some unbelivable jokes especially on drugs, wackiness and appereances by Neil Patrick Harris and Jamie Kennedy, i highly recommend renting this great comedy that will soon be a cult item.<br /><br />The unrated extreme DVD has a handful of good extras like commentaries, deleted/alternate scenes, interviews, a featurette on the "Land of Burgers" hallucination sequence, a rather disgusting art of the Fart featurette, Trailers and DVD-Rom features.</p></body></html>

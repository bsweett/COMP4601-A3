<meta name="summary" content="friends are the family you choose"></head><body><p>Although the story in Million Dollar Baby is not something entirely unique, and one might be tempted to dismiss it as a "female boxing movie", such a characterization would be overly simplistic and unfair. The story is really about building deep relationships with people who seem unlikely allies, about choosing your own family when your own family disappoints you, and choosing your battles (both literally and figuratively). Often, those closest to us and who understand us best are not in fact people related to us by the accident of being family but are people with whom we find ourselves sharing life's best and/or worst moments. The kind of bonds and indeed "love" that is unconditional, as the film deftly illustrates. Nothing breaks that kind of loyalty.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman narrates the story of a gym owner/boxing trainer, Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), who (battling his own personal demons) very reluctantly agrees to train an eager, ambitious female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank). Frankie and Maggie build a very solid rapport, and this bond seems to grow. As it grows, this bond fills a hole in Frankie's life that has been bothering him for a long time (the estrangement from his daughter, for example, has haunted and hurt him for years, leading him to make daily visits to church, where he pesters his frustrated priest). The relationship Maggie and Frankie forge is real, is close, is loyal and familial... he looks after her and feels for her like a father for his daughter. When Maggie's family uses her and attempts to manipulate her (while making fun of her), Frankie is there for Maggie, wishing to protect her from this "sponging" family dynamic.<br /><br />While the entire cast is wonderful, and Morgan Freeman turns in an amazing performance, the most remarkable aspect of Hilary Swank's career and double Oscar win is that she was once FIRED from Beverly Hills, 90210, which could easily make almost any actor give up, but Swank chose to fight and thrive on a small failure, proving her own tenacity and clout. The understated, excellent performances create a vivid, deeply moving (and quite sad) story, definitely worth seeing.</p></body></html>

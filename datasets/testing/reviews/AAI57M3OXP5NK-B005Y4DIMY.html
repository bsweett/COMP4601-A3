<meta name="summary" content="Horror Classic."></head><body><p>This is a horror classic because it stars many unknown people and it is very scary.  The only idea of the movie I didn't personally like was the spinning box at the end but hey nothing's perfect.  This movie only had a 1 million dollar budget.  If you're a fan of horror movie I suggest you get this movie and get Hellraiser 2:Hellbound also is just as good.  I heard there is another Hellraiser coming out, Hellraiser 6.  I recommend Hellraiser because horror movies will live on.</p></body></html>

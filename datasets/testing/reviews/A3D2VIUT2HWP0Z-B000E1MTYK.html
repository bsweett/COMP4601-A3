I managed to get the Hologram  package which is a great set. The only downfall on the second  disc is the interactive game, which works well for kids, but is not the best for adults. However the detail of the FX in the features are very good, but the menu is very badly designed.<br /><br />Overall though, an excellent film, with some superb extras</p></body></html>

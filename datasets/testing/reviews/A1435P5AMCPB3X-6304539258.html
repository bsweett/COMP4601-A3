<meta name="summary" content="Good for first time buyer, but for me, at least I got these cheap!!!!!"></head><body><p>If you do not already own the star wars DVD's, then this is excellent for you, so ignore the reviews below, and get this, but most folks that will buy these already have them.<br /><br />If you bought these, and own the other DVD's or VHS tapes, I hope you got them as cheap as I did (for the price of about one DVD).  These are barely worth anything over 12 bucks.  Why Lucas waisted the plastic to re-press the 2005 editions, I do not know.  He should have taken the time to make the old ones letter box or 16:9 so we can get the full screen shots again, so we can get a truely un-adultarted version of the theatrical version.  I, like many others, already have 2004 versions, and the 1995 version on vhs.  I wish he would have done the modifications as I listed above, released the versions as one disc, and then priced them to move (under 10 bucks).  I'm sure he'll see these reviews, and do that in about 2 years, so he can build another wing on his house, or buy an island in the pacific. It's too bad I had to sink and get these this way to have a DVD copy of the originals.</p></body></html>

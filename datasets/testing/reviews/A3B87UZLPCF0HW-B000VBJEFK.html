IT WAS GREAT....."></head><body><p>That wonderful company Pixar gambled on a Parisian rat with big dreams, and it scored big time with audiences(gross: $200 million) and critics even loved it!!!!!!!!! Director Brad Bird (The Incredibles) again demonstrated a greater facility for witty, heartfelt storytelling than most of his live-action peers.<br />I will own this movie.  Good, clean, laughable fun for the whole family.</p></body></html>

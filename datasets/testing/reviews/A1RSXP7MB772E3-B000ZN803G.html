<meta name="summary" content="A movie with a great message at the cost of being sad"></head><body><p>You follow the unchained ambitions of a person we all have within ourselves and this movie with several messeges has one overpowering one left for the end that comes more as a consequence than as a hurtle that some character a writer created. I saw some glimmering greatness in this films pictures-like frames that reminded me in small ways of some of the more beautiful and free movies created. Days of Heaven came to mind by Terrence Malick. In a year full of nominated movies that not many people cared about, I couldn't help but think how maybe this great and accessible movie would have perhaps awoken a bigger reception. The jury of "who ever they are who votes" academy persons lost credit with me since this movie was overlooked, as well as Zodiac. What's wrong with this film that it shouldn't stand next to No country for old men, There will be blood, Micheal Clayton, Juno? I would replace nearly any of them in fact.</p></body></html>

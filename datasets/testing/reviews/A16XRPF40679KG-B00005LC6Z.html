<meta name="summary" content="it's on blu ray finally."></head><body><p>The blu ray has finally arrived for this one. First the picture is mainly impressive in comparison to the dvd. HOWEVER, they spent nothing to remove the white specks that pop up continually throughout the film. This is damage and Universal let us down in that regard. The specks are not huge though and most of film's scenes look clarity wise very good indeed. It's similiar to 'halloween h20' which also has the specks all over it. Universal should have cleaned the specks off but they did give you 'terror in the aisles' a film about horror movies. Starring donald pleasance as the host.  And also deleted scenes and such. So it's the best we can hope for I guess.  as for the film.<br /><br />This was a big hit at the time and the reason for it was that it was a direct sequel of the first with the two main cast members Donald Pleasance and Jamie lee curtis continuing the story.  In this one Michael is still killing off everyone around his sister to terrorize her,  before he finally finishes her off. But she of course is trying to survive and so it goes.  This is great horror and well worth seeing ONLY after you see the original Halloween.</p></body></html>

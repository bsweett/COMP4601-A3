<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>The Island brings to the screen the story of a man and a woman who flee a secret facility, which produces clones for "spare parts."  At first it might seem like an improbable scenario, but Hollywood has been noted to foresee events before (e.g. Wag the Dog-instead of Albania it was Yugoslavia, The Day after Tomorrow-instead of ice it's hurricanes, Deep Impact-instead of a tidal wave hitting the USA it hits Indonesia and Sri Lanka, Outbreak-instead of the Ebola-like virus it's SARS and/or the bird flu, etc).<br /><br />Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />The first half of the movie is really good, but the second half is a bit of a disappointment with its unnecessary and extremely long car chases and explosions.<br /><br />In addition the whole escape sequence from the facility was rather unrealistic even for a sci-fi movie.<br /><br />Aside from that, the plot and the setting, are both excellent!  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.<br /><br />Overall, even though The Island lacks that extra something to put it over the top, it is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

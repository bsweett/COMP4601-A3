<meta name="summary" content="classic horror film has three versions.  the blu ray looks great."></head><body><p>I love this horror movie and in it's day it was so shocking that it caused real concern, today the same effects are seen on tv! But this movie is a classic , and any pinhead who reviews this as less than that doesn't know horror movies or their history.  Some movies are classics and remain so even thirty years later.  This was made in a different environment to todays movie scene. It was radical for it's day and it changed things. IT was also a hit at the cinemas. Audiences went to it in droves. That's the truth. NOw there are three versions of this one. the first is called 'zombie' the europeon cut of this one, then the long directors cut which is on a double sided dvd and it was one of the first dvd's ever put out! The other is the theaterical cut which is on the blu ray. Which looks great by the way. It has little in the way of extras though.</p></body></html>

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers star as US commandos on a rescue mission in South America, but when they find a group of skinned corpses hanging upside down, plans change.  Eventually, one by one each soldier is picked off by an unseen force, until only Arnold is left, and he comes face to face with the sleek alien hunter called the predator which takes his prey's skulls as his trophy.  The design of the Predator itself is in a word, awesome.  FX and makeup legend Stan Winston (responsible for Pumpkinhead and the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park for starters) outdid himself with the design of the beast, as Arnold puts it in the final fight, "One ugly mother......".  While the movie is great, some more special features would have been nice.  There is a rumor of a battle filmed between the Predator and Billy which would have been nice to see.  All in all though, if you've never had a chance to see the original Predator, now has never been a better time, its one of the best sci-fi/action movies of all time.  On a side note, future governor and former WWF wrestler Jessie "The Body" Ventura played one of the commandos, and Jean-Claude Van Damme was originally supposed to be the man in the Predator outfit, but he bowed out at the last minute to film Bloodsport.</p></body></html>

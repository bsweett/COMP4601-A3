<meta name="summary" content="This Movie F*cking Rules!"></head><body><p>Out of all the spaghetti westerns ever made, Sergio Leone made his Man With No Name trilogy rock when spaghetti westerns had never rocked before.  This is hands down one of the coolest westerns ever made and one of the coolest Clint Eastwood flicks!  Gut-wrenching camera work and killer music, this is the movie you want when you need to see a good western.</p></body></html>

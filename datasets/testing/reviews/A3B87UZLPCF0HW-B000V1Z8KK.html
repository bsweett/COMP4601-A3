<meta name="summary" content="Very exciting movie"></head><body><p>This exciting movie starring Mark Wahberg, Micheal Pena, Danny Glover,<br />Katie Mara, Rhona Mitra, and Ned Beatty was one of the best action flicks I have seen in a long time.<br />Fuqua show us in this movie a government riddled with dishonesty, disloyalty, deception, and vigilantism.  Mark Wahlberg is the lead actor in Shooter and is remarkable as an action star.<br />The movie shows a very good collection of cast members that provides good performances and special effects, considerable gunfire scenes and military combat that is very exciting to the human eye.<br />I do believe I will own this movie for my collection.</p></body></html>

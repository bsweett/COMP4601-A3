<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie. Lame DVD"></head><body><p>This is one of those rush rush get it out jobs and you can tell. The movie isn't even all on one side. There's no commentary and this is one of those DVDs that tries touting the selection menu as one of the "special features." Unless you can get this at a discount, wait until the real DVD with real extras comes out.</p></body></html>

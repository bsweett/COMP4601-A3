<meta name="summary" content="Probably the Most Fun of the Movies"></head><body><p>I think this is one of the more fun of the Potter movies, and one of the best suited for younger children, as it has a lot of action and 'color' due to the opening sequence at the professional Quidditch championship match, and the Tri-Wizard tournament once everyone arrives at Hogwarts. However, as other reviewers have stated, the lack of additional features on this edition is disappointing, but I've decided to dock only 1 star for that, rather than panning the entire movie because of this problem.<br /><br />The Triwizard tournament offers a lot of opportunity for great special effects, including the arrival of the other two teams - in a giant submergible ship, and a stagecoach pulled by flying horses. The Velas are a bit disappointing however, it seems most of their charms must have ended up on the cutting room floor. Other things also felt a bit rushed - the opening Quidditch match is superbly done, and I would have loved more time there. We also don't get to see any of Harry's opponents in the first Triwizard challenge - the dragon challenge - although Harry's battle with his dragon is superb. The other challenges are handled well though, and considering the amount of groundwork this movie has to cover, overall it does a great job.<br /><br />The dynamics of the characters are also done well, and the psychological challenges of adolescence as they unfold - Ron's initial jealousy, the growing tension/attraction between Hermione and Ron, Harry's burgeoning crush on Cho. These are important themes in the rest of the story, and they are handled well here. And when it all finally and definitely turns dark with the death of Cedric, it is heart-wrenching - the pain of his father grieving over his body changes everything (and of course, this part is not so good for young children, although I chose to show it to mine and talk through it.) This marks a turning point in the battle between good and evil as they play out in this series, and it was very critical that it was given the weight it needed.<br /><br />So overall, a great film, in terms of both special effects and the unfolding drama. Leaves us ready for the battle to begin in book and movie 5.</p></body></html>

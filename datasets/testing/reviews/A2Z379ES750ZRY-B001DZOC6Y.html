<meta name="summary" content="Creepy memorable non-CGI imagery makes it entertaining."></head><body><p>Wow...I can't believe I'm going against the grain of the general consensus that this movie is bad.<br /><br />Whatever your opinion on whether the premise that vegetation is the culprit...that aside, the movie kept me at the edge of my seat for the full 90 minutes.<br />It does convey fairly well how people behave during a crisis.<br />The camera work, expressions, imagery and music etc are chillingly effective -  as many have mentioned, a la, Twilight Zone.<br />Completely original story, when compared to a lot of movies made nowadays...largely done without CGI.<br />Roller-coaster emotional ride - odd blend of humor, terror, sadness etc.</p></body></html>

Placing it into the VCR, a large glowing ring appears on the screen in front of you. After that graphic and disturbing images begin to flash on the television screen culminating to a final scene of a black and white forest with a well in the middle. Then the screen turns fuzzy and the tape is finished. Sound like another college independent art film right? Well, let's say that your phone rings and the voice on the other end says you have seven days before you die. Just an urban legend, right? What if it came true? This is the idea from the Japanese horror film, Ringu, which was adapted for American audiences in the thriller, The Ring. But will the adaptation work for American audiences or will the creators of the film be the only ones that are scared?<p>The story goes that Rachel Keller is investigating the death of a teenage girl whose cause of death was declared unknown. But she soon discovers that this story goes way beyond this teenage girl's death. Three other teenagers that were friends of hers also died on the same day at the exact same time as the teenage girl. Their deaths were also declared unknown. What is the connection between the four teenagers? About one week before their deaths, they traveled up to a remote cabin in the woods where they had stumbled upon a tape. Rachel comes upon the tape and watches it. The phone rings and the voice on the other end of the phone tells her she has seven days before she dies. She has seven days to discover the mystery of The Ring before time runs out. The Ring has one of the best stories out there. The plot goes way beyond the usual horror fare that is released around the fall season. Unfortunately the ending ruins almost all tension and mystery that is presented in the film.<p>The cast does a stellar job of presenting believable characters and making the fear altogether more real. Naomi Watts is great in the role of Rachel Keller, the investigative reporter who searches for the answer to the mystery of The Ring. Her character is mainly the focus of the film, though not entirely, and she does a wonderful job of making her character both a wonderful mother figure as well as a strong hero. Martin Henderson plays Rachel's ex-husband who helps her discover the mystery of The Ring. Henderson does a good job though you don't really get to see too many scenes with just him outside of a scene near the end of the film. He is usually just playing of Naomi Watts or her character's son, played by David Dorfman. David Dorfman does a great job at giving a creepy feeling to the audience but also making the audiences feel sympathetic toward his character. His character, though, came off as a Sixth Sense rip-off in parts but not too much so. Daveigh Chase, who voiced the character of Lilo in Disney's Lilo &amp; Stitch, is exceptionally creeping and disturbing as the character of Samara Morgan. Revealing what her character does would give away too much of the movie. But rest assured, she does a fabulous job in this important role.<p>Overall, The Ring goes way beyond the usual horror fare that is dumped during the fall season. As good as it is, the film's ending does not do it justice because the ending is so ridiculously stupid that it ruins the effects presented earlier in the film. Not to say the rest of the film outside of the ending is not good. Gore Verbinski, whose next project is Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, does a great job of presenting the right amount of tension and excitement in parts of the film where it is needed. Unfortunately the ending ruins those effects by giving the audience an ending that makes them feel ripped off. There is no real logical way to explain the feeling without giving away most of the plot. There are also many parts of the mystery of the Ring that are left unsolved but they will reportedly be solved in either the prequel or sequel to the film which is expected to open in theaters in October 2004. If you do decided to watch The Ring, you are in for a real cinematic treat but don't have too high expectations as the ending will leave you disappointed.</p></body></html>

But in the same vein as "Romancing The Stone," Indiana Jones" and about a dozen other find the treasure in the jungle action-comedies, "The Rundown" succeeds as a big noisy popcorn flick. It also proves that The Rock can carry his own picture when surrounded with a cast of A-List actors. <p>It's worth noting the opening quick cameo with Arnold S., who, in a significant "pass the torch" moment, mutters "have fun" to our hero. And that The Rock does. There's enough scenery chewing here to feed a few starving nations, all of it delightfully shot in "Brazil" (ne: Hawaii). Christopher Walken is the baddy, but he does get to hammily play something other than a deranged villain for a change, Sean William Scott continues to grow into a mature comic actor, and Rosario Dawson gets the tough but gold-hearted female heroine in peril role. All suit their roles well. Given the generally disappointing action movies of the summer, it's nice that one was saved till fall to redeem the genre.</p></body></html>

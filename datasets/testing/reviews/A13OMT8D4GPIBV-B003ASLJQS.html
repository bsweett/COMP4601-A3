Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon all give excellent performances in this flawed masterpiece.  The supporting casts exemplifies the material perfectly.  One of the best of 2003.<br /><br />This particular DVD is such and upgrafe from the barebones disc.  The DVD features a commentary with Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon and a few featurettes.  Also included in this three disc release is the film's soundtrack.<br /><br />Must Have.</p></body></html>

I thought that the story was easy to follow, well written, and full of surprises. For example, I had no idea (because I didn't read the comics and only saw some of the cartoons and the X-Men movies) that Wolverine was Sabertooth's brother (and I am not even sure that this was in the original storyline of Wolverine). I loved that twist and others in the story. And while I wouldn't say that the movie was exactly fast moving and action packed (don't get me wrong, there are some great fight scenes) ...I thought Origins did a wonderful job setting the stage for later X-Men stories. And I now understand why Wolverine has very few memories of his life pre-metal claws. We also got to see several of the characters from later stories (Gambit, Professor X, etc.) and understand how some mutants became X-Men!<br /><br />Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine, and I liked Sabertooth's character as well. Understanding the Wolverine/Sabertooth dynamic is key I think, to later stories or even potential storylines.<br /><br />Now a brief synopsis of the movie.....As a young boy Wolverine discovers that everything in his life is not as it seems, and finding out that he has a brother is the least of his worries. For spending years fighting beside his brother has not prepared him for a future of tracking down mutants for his boss, a military man trying to cure his son (who has mutant powers), and eliminating them because they are threats. When Wolverine decides that killing and fighting isn't necessarily fun anymore, and maybe the person they are working for isn't what he appears, he leaves the organization and settles down as a lumberjack. The rest is a story that only you can appreciate if you watch it. Understanding the motives for people's actions is not always as clear cut as you would think, in this movie. There are tales of jealousy, greed, and power woven throughout. Anyway,<br />X-Men Origins, had tons of great characters (interesting mutants with interesting powers) and a sweet love story to boot. I don't see why people are being so hard on this movie because it really wasn't that bad, or maybe it is because I was expecting a lot worse.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE MOST FUN FLICKS EVER"></head><body><p>MACHETE<br /><br />As any one who knows me can tell you I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan and a huge Robert Rodriguez fan, so naturally I love their work. This film being another Grindhouse type film especially since it was based on a trailer for that film is really fun. Any one who does not like violence, naked women, and violence should stay away. Also add in that I am a huge Steven Seagal fan and that this film was filmed here in Austin Texas, you know I loved it. This of course being another film QT and RR collaborated on, and yes they did QT was an uncredited producer. It should also be noted that Danny Trejo played this character in the three Spy Kids movies.<br /><br />Machete [Trejo] is a man who has some what lost his way in life ever since a drug kingpin named Torrez [Seagal] killed his family. Since then he does hard manual labor for money until he is offered a hit. The hit of course is on a Texas politician [De Niro] who has a thing against illegal immigrants in Texas. When the hit goes bad as he was set up he goes back to his federale days and goes into kill mode. As the rampage goes on and every one from politicians, to priests, underground rebels, and US agents get involved the big players start to come out. That of course being the reemergence of Torrez as he is linked with Senator McLaughlin [De Niro], turns out they have a plan to own the drug trafficking in and out of Texas.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully entertaining Mexploitation flick and is one of the best times I had at the movies all year. Every thing any one could want is in this movie, from great over the top action to some great romance [Machete sex music begins to play here]. The great over the top action is brilliant but one of the best parts has to be the exit from the hospital, any one who has seen it knows what I am talking about. The blood and violence of this are actually extremely well done, it is overly fun but at the same time isn't overly campy if that makes sense. In fact like many have said the opening scenes of the film let you know exactly what type of movie this is.<br /><br />Danny Trejo is wonderful as if you didn't know as Machete and is right at home in this flick. He has been doing these types of roles for Rodriguez for years; in fact he has played Machete in the "Spy Kids" flicks. Jeff Fahey is masterful here looking like he is straight out of "Pulp Fiction" and having a weird thing for his daughter, and Robert De Niro looks like he has never had more fun in any other role. Now of course you know from the trailer that the ladies are here and looking oh so good while being oh so bad. Michelle Rodriguez has never looked hotter, man I love her so much, plus her character is really cool. Jessica Alba is fun here as well and to be honest surprised me a bit, she was kinda funny. Lindsey Lohan was another surprise here as I thought she did a good job with the time she got on screen.<br /><br />Of course Cheech Marin is always great and here provides a lot of great and humorous scenes. But with every one in this [all of which were great and fun] I am going to have to say Steven Seagal stole the show a bit. Now I know all kinds of people are going to disagree with me but I thought he was hilarious. His last scene with Trejo is brilliant with the sword fight and all that, but his final bit of dialogue and actions are priceless. I have never laughed so hard ever, it was truly brilliant.<br /><br />Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis and written by Robert and &Aacute;lvaro Rodr&iacute;guez this movie was extremely fun, funny, and over the top. There are also some messages about this country and its politics but they don't beat you over the head. The style of the flick is much like that of the EXCELLENT "Grindhouse" film that RR and QT gave us so you know it looks great and has a great feel. I do recommend this flick to any and every one, BUY IT when it is released. I will be picking it up the second it is released, you should do the same.</p></body></html>

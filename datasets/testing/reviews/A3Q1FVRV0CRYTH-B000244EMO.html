At the time that was a very true statement.  I still remember the first time I saw this film.  I was chilled to the bone unlike I had ever been before (granted I was only 13).  The film follows a group of US Army Commandos led by non other than the manly man himself Arnold Schwarzenegger (of whom I am NOT a fan but he works here) as they are picked off one by one by a mysterious creature.  This creature has come down to hunt men and that he does.  The action is top notch, and the final showdown between man and beast is brilliant.  Even now, almost 20 years after the film's release, it's still top-notch entertainment.  From the moment we see the skinned bodies hanging from the trees to the moment we hear that horrid creature laughing as he knows his life is over we are glued to our seats and ingrossed in one of the best action films ever to be released.  And to think, this stars Arnold?!?!?!</p></body></html>

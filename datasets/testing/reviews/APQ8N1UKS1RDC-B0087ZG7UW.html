<meta name="summary" content="12 CABINS 12 VACANCY'S"></head><body><p>I had to write a tribute to this masterpiece of<br /><br />horror.Though in no way does Psycho stand alone<br /><br />as a HORROR masterpiece it did get us into the<br /><br />open,by that I mean the nightmares are no longer<br /><br />wrapped in bandages or have scar tissue long fangs<br /><br />and howl at the moon.No the nightmare can be at your<br /><br />next door.This movie paved the way for so many Horror<br /><br />masterpiece's.This movie as well as Rosemary's baby<br /><br />and NIGHT of the LIVING DEAD said to all the up coming<br /><br />director's O.K. we've shown you now what can you do<br /><br />with Horror films in the 70's!Well we all no what Horror<br /><br />films have came in the 70's and thank you to all involved<br /><br />in Psycho for we would not have Last house on the left-Halloween<br /><br />Black Christmas-Phantasm-Carrie-Suspira-Omen-Exorcist-Texas<br /><br />Chainsaw-Cannibal Holocaust-The Shining-Rabid or even JAWS.<br /><br />I write this for you can read any other review about the movie<br /><br />I just wanted to say Hail,Hail to Psycho(60) no,I mean NO!<br /><br />HORROR catalog is complete without this BABY!It is a difinitive<br /><br />masterpiece on the macabre A-A- BOY'S BESTFRIEND IS HIS MOTHER.<br /><br />eeee.Perkins was so fantastic still gives me shivers.My fav.<br /><br />scene the first time we see mother walking past the window<br /><br />frame in the pouring rain.Till this day that scene alone has<br /><br />buried most of the horror crap that has come out in 2000-2007<br /><br />I love the horror films from the 20's,30's 40's and the HAMMERS<br /><br />but again thank you movie Psycho for the breath of fresh air.</p></body></html>

Hose off the Detroit grit and the cliches are all there: the struggling talent; the quicksand of home life; the 'friend' with connections offering a fast track to success; the relationship subplot; and, of course, the climactic musical number that secures both moral and professional glory. So don't be surprised if you feel like you've seen this one before. But you will be surprised to find that Eminem can act. I mean really.  There isn't a single moment when you see through him, which is more than can be said for plenty of A-list Hollywood stars.  I was stunned.  Less impressive are the tortuously correct scenes where the one-time bad boy rewrites his own history by drawing a distinction between being gay and being 'a faggot'.  Yet despite such lapses, Scott Silver's screenplay forges a careful path between the irritating extremes of rap/hip-hop culture - its pseudo-intellectual ramblings on race politics, and the black fetishising of white wealth - to tell a story which is actually pro-family, pro-work and pro-individual effort. It's almost Protestant. But it still doesn't resolve rap culture's inherent contradictions. To wit: if living in 'the 313' - perfectly captured by director Hanson in all its horrific squalor - is so great, so 'real', then why is everyone, including our hero, so desperate to get out? And the villain's main crimes are to have a banal real name (Clarence), and to have gone to a private school. But where do you think little Lily will be headed the moment big bro' B Rabbit (with the no less banal real name of 'Jimmy Smith') makes his first million?  Don't try to resolve it, because you won't.  Just listen to the lyrics.  Eminem's closing track, "Lose Yourself", makes the argument in 5 minutes better than Silver's screenplay does in 110: it's all about seizing opportunities, about having enough faith to take a chance on yourself.  As a story about that kind of moment, "8 Mile" works better than most in the genre.</p></body></html>

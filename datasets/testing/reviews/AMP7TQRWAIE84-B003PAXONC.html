Every time Will kept trying to convince himself he'd be alright walking through the halls of an empty store, pretending to pay for things while he was ultimately alone (minus his dog), I initially thought it was strange. Then, that strangeness turned out to be very, very testing later on.<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn't excited to see this movie. I didn't really hear  much about it specifically which was great. But my brother rented it so when we finally got it, I saw the back. There were "zombies" there and I wasn't really up for it. Not scared just totally not interested.<br /><br />And then I watched. It was alright. In the beginning. But as it progressed and I digested what was going on I was amazed, captivated and totally down and out for him and his situation.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't see how anyone could turn there head and say this movie "was alright" or "it sucked". But then I think and know that people have their own opinions...<br /><br />For those who have yet to see it, see it. It's fabulous. I know I didn't really say much about the movie but it's interesting. The storyline is good and the characters decent. But it's mostly Will. That's what you see: Will. Every day. But once it sinks in I'm sure you'll like it too.<br /><br />4.2 stars.<br /><br />end note: Will's still as attractive but he totally got too skinny. I think that was expected for the role. But for guys like me and females he's totally cut. He needs to stay in shape for what's to come...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sick, Twisted, and FUN! This Korean film is worth your time!"></head><body><p>Ha, Ha! I saw this yesterday and it was wonderful! A Korean film which totally has the "Innocent suffer first" feel!<br /><br />This movie is about a series of crimes in Korea. A man investigates these brutal murders, and tries to decipher all the clues that leave the trail of murders. It's awesome!<br /><br />A lot of ppl that I know have complained about the state of unrealisim in this movie. Like a guy sticks a needle deep into his hand and survives.<br /><br />So everyone: SEE IT!</p></body></html>

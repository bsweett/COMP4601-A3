<meta name="summary" content="Actually 3 1/2 Stars - Good despite the "Barbarella" plot"></head><body><p>The main problem with this film is the goofy names for everything; I'm suprised Judy Dench could recite her lines without laughing. "Necromongers"?? Its just so corny. The film's producer picked the wrong screenplay writer, which is the source of the film's problems.<p>Vin Diesel did an excellent job playing Riddick, the conflicted mercenary/killer. The film has alot of good action scenes and Vin does a good job with them. Unlike alot of people, I liked the way the film ended; of course it is a setup for what will be a very interesting sequel. <p>Hopefully, the producers of the next Riddick film will use a different writer.</p></body></html>

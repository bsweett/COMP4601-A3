<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating look at Emperor penguins"></head><body><p>Most people know little about the frozen continent named Antarctica.  This documentary is an informative and fascinating look at one of its major inhabitants, the Emperor penguin.  It shows a year in the life of these animals, from the long trek to the breeding grounds, to mating rituals, to the unusual parenting practices of this species.  The photography ranges from panoramic views of this beautiful, yet barren land to intimate closeups of the penguins living, loving, and working to stay alive.  The only jarring note is the insertion of anthropomorphic statements to describe the "feelings" of the birds at various times in their lives.  The parent birds are described as unhappy to be leaving their offspring in order to return to the feeding grounds, but it appears that they are simply following centuries-old instincts which allow for survival.  Other than that, this is a charming look at a wonderfully entertaining bird whose life practices to this point were little known by most people.</p></body></html>

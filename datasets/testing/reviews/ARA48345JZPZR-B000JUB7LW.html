For reasons unknown to me, Amazon declined to publish them.  So I will be brief:<br /><br />This is a film for all those (and judging by my reading of Amazon reviews: they are legion) who loathe America and love a romanticized and fictitious culture peopled with wise and far nobler folks than we crass capitalists.  It is a false, pernicious, and short-sighted view of the world, history and the achievements and failings of human beings everywhere.  But it has a vast and gullible audience that eats it up. So, indulge yourselves once more.<br /><br />Every culture and all people everywhere have their glories, delights, and their failings and shames.  God knows that is as true of Japanese history and culture as well as it is of American! The film deplores American cruelty and completely overlooks the cruelty inherent in the Bushido code and what it  meant to the peoples conquered by the Japanese.  This is not only biased, it is downright dishonest.<br /><br />But, I make too much of what is typical Hollywood romanticized pap!  It looks pretty, it was well-made, the art direction was fine, and the performances were tolerable.  I couldn't get past the underlieing BS, but maybe you can.</p></body></html>

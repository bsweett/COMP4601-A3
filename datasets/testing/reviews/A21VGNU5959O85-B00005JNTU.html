<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic Mess"></head><body><p>Its clobbering time? Sigh, I suppose that line was supposed to rouse some sort of familial inner child of mine to like this movie. It didn't work. The Fantastic Four starring all B list actors and a couple of C listers was a serious stinker.  I love comics, and the movies lately based on these comics (x-men, superman, batman begins, Spiderman) have been super-delish, unfortunately there is always a couple that try to latch onto the capes of the successful and wind up being an hour and a half long ode to clich&eacute;s and horrible acting. Poor Jessica Alba, with her Bratz doll look-alike face could not hold this movie up by herself, nor could her mediocre skills at trying to be a scientist. Mr. Fantastic? Who the heck is this guy, I looked him up on IMDB and he was Horatio Hornblower, could they not get someone else! He might have looked like the comic character, but to me he looked more like the lovechild of James Woods and Jeff Goldblum.  The others like Thing, and Torch guy, and Dr Nip and Tuck were so bland and one dimensional it seemed like during the whole film I was waiting for the cardboard cutouts to flipping leave and the real people actors to step in. The storyline, basically a soap opera with sparks. Tim Story who directed this has as far as I can see one major film under his belt "Barbershop", and he is slated to direct the next Fantastic Four movie, which has the foursome adding a fifth the Silver Surfer being played by Doug Adams who was the fish guy in Hell boy. I will have to say that no part of my body mind or soul wishes to sit through another FF mess.</p></body></html>

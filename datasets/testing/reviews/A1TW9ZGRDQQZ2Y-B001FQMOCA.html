How could they nominate Hustle & Flow and Munich, while leaving this film (praised by almost everyone who has seen it) in the dust. Joaquin Phoenix is very convincing as Johnny Cash in performance and vocals, and Reese Witherspoon steals the show as June Carter. Reese has got the Oscar, but Joaquin has a much tougher crowd of actors to deal with. I am so glad they aren't making us wait any more months for this DVD. It just left theater and we can buy it in less than two weeks. Yipee!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A great portrait of a very strange man.."></head><body><p>Werner Herzog (who directed such classics as Aguirre wrath of god, fitzcaraldo, and the brilliant adaptation of nosferatu) has been making some fabulous documentaries in recent years.. He seems to be obsessed primarily with the bizzare.. In particular with people who have big dreams - and usually very absurd dreams.. I think Herzog, more than anything else, identifies with such people (afterall he worked in the most impossible conditions himself to create his greatest films)..<br />The subject of this film is Timothy treadwell a man who for a number of years actually managed to coexist with a group of giant grizzly bears..<br />Treadwell was an interesting often humorous figure who really meant well -but was driven over the edge by his own philosophy.. The man, as herzog claims, had a view of nature similar to walt disney.. while i think this claim may be slightly exagerated given the fact that treadwill actually did live in nature and must have had some notion of reality and the cycle of life - there is deffinately some truth to the fact that this man was slightly, shall i say, off his rocker.. As the film progresses and we learn a little about his background - we tend to wonder how much of a role drugs played in his early years.. I admit i had many laughs at treadwell's expense throughout the film - but that did not take away from the devistating notion of how he was killed..<br />Herzog's point of view in this movie is thought-provoking and highly subjective.. But it is his insistance on digging deeper and learning more that make this one of the most interesting documentaries i have seen..</p></body></html>

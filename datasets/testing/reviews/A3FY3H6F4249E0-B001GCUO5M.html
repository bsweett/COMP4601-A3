<meta name="summary" content="Psychological Thriller--Excellent!"></head><body><p>WOW!--in caps!<br />This was an excellent movie--a Martin Scorsese picture.  I call it a psychological thriller because it really messes with your head.  Through the whole movie, I didn't know what was real and what was imaginatory.  It had me hooked. I was engrossed in the story from the very beginning right through to the end, and the time passed so fast.<br /><br />Our story begins in Boston Harbor Islands, 1954.  Ted/Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a U.S. Federal Marshall traveling on a small boat with his head in the commode, barfing away from motion sickness.  (Don't worry.  You don't see anything.)  Charlie/Chuck is another Marshall traveling with him--calls Ted "Boss".  They are enroute to Shutter Island, a one-of-a kind Federal psychiatric treatment and housing facility for the severely criminally insane.  Of course, this is a high-security facility, surrounded by an electric perimeter and police or guards (not sure which, but will call them "guards" here), and is on an island with high, rocky cliffs.  The only way in or out is via ferry, and the ferry is controlled by the federal facility.<br /><br />As Teddy and Chuck's ferry docks at the Shutter Island pier, they are met by guards and transported to and inside the facility perimeter.  The outside grounds are beautiful!--pretty as an English mansion.  Some of the "guests" are manning the grounds as the guards explain to Teddy and Chuck that buildings A and B house the better adjusted guests while building C is for the most dangerous ones.  These are the incurables.  Building C is an old fort.<br /><br />We soon meet the primary doctor, played by Ben Kingsley.  He explains basically that the concept of the hospital is to provide treatment for the severely criminally insane who are beyond help at other facilities.  If the hospital cannot help the guests, they claim to at least try to provide a means of comfort for the guests to live in.  We also soon meet Max VonSydow (Needful Things, Buck Rogers, Three Days of the Condor, and many other movies) as another doctor and primary member of the hospital staff.<br /><br />Teddy and Chuck were sent to investigate the disappearance of a guest, Rachel Solondo.  Rachel drowned her three children in the lake but believes they are still alive.  She also believes the facility is actually her home in the Berkshires and the others are all attendants, so it is unlikely that she would try to leave, besides--there is no way to get out and no where to go if she did.<br /><br />Teddy also has his own demons to deal with.  He was one of the WWII soldiers who got to bust up the Krakow concentration camp at the end of the war.  Seeing the piles of dead bodies (men, women, and children) and the living victims of the camp left him with nightmares and flashbacks.  In addition, he is tormented by the memories of his pretty wife dying in a fire caused by an arsonist.  In the midst of his investigation and a raging hurricane, he becomes convinced that this facility is a house of medical experimentation in the use of psychotropic drugs, brain surgery, and barbaric torture.  Although he is told to "RUN," he is determined to find out the truth.<br /><br />As I said before, this is a "WOW" movie.  It kept my mind completely engaged throughout the entire movie.  DiCaprio did a fantastic job in his role and you really could not second guess what would happen next.  Even though I know what happens, I would watch it again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Note that I do NOT suggest this movie for your children.  ADULTS ONLY is my strong recommendation--as in age 18 or older.  I believe the concepts are too harsh for a developing mind. So please, watch it first by yourself--then decide.</p></body></html>

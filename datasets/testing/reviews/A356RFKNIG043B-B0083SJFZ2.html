There was little pretense of creating a dramatic masterpiece, and much focus on action and thrills, both of which were delivered well, aided by an excellent score. The film starts somewhat slowly but soon ramps up and moves along nicely, and as a simple piece of entertainment I enjoyed it.<br /><br />COTT doesn't hew very closely to the real Greek myths, but so what. Neither did the original, and I found this version much less hokey and much more enjoyable. Fiennes and Neeson add some dramatic weight to the proceedings (if not overly much), and Worthington contributes his two sides: dogged determination beset by underlying fear and uncertainty, and the curious puppy on the way to doggedness. Which is perfect, as we wouldn't want too much real acting to remind us how ridiculous this whole exercise is.<br /><br />The effects are exemplary, which is the key to all the fun, and the sound effects and Djawadi's crackling score complete the visceral thrills. There are some fine action scenes, especially in Medusa's cave and the final Kraken battle, and the almost flawless blu-ray transfer does them justice. This was just plain fun to watch on a good set-up; crank the volume on your surround sound and prepare to be floored by good old goofy b-movie intensity. With an a-movie budget.<br /><br />I didn't expect much coming in and got more than I'd hoped for, and I might even watch this again some day.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Red Eye"></head><body><p>Lisa Reisert hates to fly, but the terror that awaits her on the night flight to Miami has nothing to do with a fear of flying. Upon boarding the plane, Lisa is pleasantly surprised to find that she is seated next to Jackson, the seemingly charming man with whom she had shared a drink--and perhaps even a brief flirtation--in the airport terminal. But moments after takeoff, Jackson drops his facade and menacingly reveals the real reason he's on board. Red Eye is a nifty, tense thriller and a gripping melodrama.</p></body></html>

Shot for only 5 million, this is a nice science fiction thriller.  For the Transformers crowd, there are no big explosions or lasers.  This is a character driven story with the only face you really see is Sam Rockwell.  A few faces appear on monitors, and you get the voice of Kevin Spacey(very HAL).  It is hard to describe the movie without giving anything away.  Earth has exhausted its resources, but on the moon they can mine Helium-3 which is a great energy source.  Sam is alone on the moon for the last 3 years overseeing the automated mining operation.  He is two weeks away from going back home.  But then things start to go wrong and questions arise.  Really a good performance by Sam, especially considering he had no one else to play off of.  There were a couple of little plot holes that I noticed, but it takes away very little from a wonderful story.  Anyone interested in a character driven story with a sci-fi touch, then this a great movie to pick up.</p></body></html>

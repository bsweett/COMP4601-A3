Roger Ebert, however, isn't dating a guy that is exactly like Vince Vaughn's character Gary. This movie really hit home with me personally, solely for that reason: I know exactly what Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) is feeling. While I try to remain unbiased in reviews, I'm beginning to learn that this is an impossibility, that some movies are going to affect you more or less depending on your experiences. All in all, I enjoyed the film, despite wanting to cry every time Gary does or says something insensitive, leaving Brooke just nodding her head and walking away in defeat. It has it's funny moments, though these are few and far between, which makes the movie somewhat dull, with not enough wit or intelligence.<br /><br />Gary and Brooke have been dating for a couple years when they decide to buy a marvelous condo together. He doesn't pick up after himself, saying that he's tired after being at work all day. Brooke has been at work all day, too, but still manages to clean up after Gary, picking up the slack while he plays video games. They have a relationship-ending fight after she spends 3 hours after working all day to cook and clean for a family dinner, something which Gary didn't help with at all, refusing to set the table or even simply get ready for when the company arrives. Brooke feels unappreciated, and she can't take it anymore. But what's this couple to do with the expensive condo they bought? They share the space, attempt to make each other jealous, hoping that the other will change to suit their needs.<br /><br />While the situation could've been hilarious, it was just plain sad. I felt awkward watching the majority of this movie, because Aniston and Vaughn seem so uneasy around one another. Previews and trailers have dubbed this movie a "romantic comedy," but there's hardly any romance and very little comedy. And this movie doesn't follow the typical "boy meets girl" formula, which is refreshing, but with the absence of Vaughn's tpyical rip-roaring comedy, the movie is stale. Still, give this one a look see, especially if you're in a relationship that seems to be equally stale.</p></body></html>

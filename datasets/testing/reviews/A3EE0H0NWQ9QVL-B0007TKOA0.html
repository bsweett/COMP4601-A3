<meta name="summary" content="Not Side-splitting, but a Good Diversion"></head><body><p>"Sideways" has a fine premise for a movie:  Two friends go traveling in Northern California to celebrate the freedom of bachelorhood before one of them gets married.  Both have their own selfish interests and addictions:  (One is addicted to alcohol [Paul Giamatti]; the other is addicted to sex [Thomas Hayden Church].)  Their passions seem to be their only bond, for they increasingly separate from one another, each to pursue his own obsession.  Their escapades reveal desperation for each and provide some revealing and comic situations along the way.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional.  Paul Giamatti is particularly expert at playing the lonely wino and conniosseur.  We may not always like the characters (and maybe we're not supposed to), but we can find their struggles and the story appealing enough.  The story is complete, unlike some films that only try to illustrate relationships and do little else.  "Sideways" is a worthy trip and a good diversion, but it may require an acquired palette.</p></body></html>

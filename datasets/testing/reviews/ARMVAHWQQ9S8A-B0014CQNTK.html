<meta name="summary" content="Best Movie of 2007"></head><body><p>This universally enjoyable film, like all the greats, will leave you with that "ahhhh" feeling once it is over.  It is not over-long (a recent trend with popular movies) and the story is quite simply well told, both through the amazing cinematography and the witty dialogue that snaps, crackles, and pops across the screen.<br /><br />Whether you're in it for the heartwarming story, the witty one-(or two or three)liners, or just looking for something different to watch, I suggest you stop searching right now and settle on "Juno."  It's one of those films that will leave you with that odd feeling of wanting more, yet satisfaction with the completed story it tells.  And so far, I've only talked about the writing and the direction.  The cast is great, starring the fresh-face of Ellen Page, who captures the essence of Juno's character perfectly.  Her voice, her gestures, and even the way she walks are all a part of crafting this character, and Ellen Page has done a spectacular job.  The rest of the cast, Michael Cerra (of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZEZGI">Superbad</a> fame) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5V8DG">Alias's</a> Jennifer Garner are all wonderful in this film.  Also, I can't finish off this review without saying how hilarious Olivia Thirlby is as Juno's best friend, Leah.<br /><br />If this review seems like gushing praise, I suggest you contest what I'm saying and give Juno a try.  If you don't return praising the movie as much as I have, then... Then you simply did not see the same movie.  "Juno" is the movie of the year, without a doubt.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="surprisingly good!"></head><body><p>The Devil's Rejects is actually good!  It's suspenseful, interesting and *extremely* bloody.<br /><br />For years I thought Rob Zombie was some kind of joke director never really capable of delivering *true* suspense or horror- only capable of offering the really fake and exaggerated variety.  Much to my surprise, this movie proves otherwise.<br /><br />It's about an old man dressed up as a clown, a long-haired dirty and scruffy looking guy, and a hot Jessica Simpson-looking blonde who go around deserted western towns terrorizing and tormenting the few innocent people they happen to come across.  They viciously stab, beat on, and humiliate people sexually because they believe they're doing "the devils work" (hence the name of the movie).<br /><br />An underlying theme is a police officer who's out for revenge and does his very best to track down these three horrible murderers.  Will he succeed?  Well you'll have to watch it to find out.<br /><br />This movie is DEFINITELY more appropriate for fans of the more intense variety of horror films such as the Hills Have Eyes.  The graphic nature of the killings is obviously why.  I wasn't expecting such a disturbing take on the suspense genre with Rob Zombie at the helm but I was flat out *wrong* in this case.  His most spectacular participation directing movies is by FAR best experienced in the Devil's Rejects!<br /><br />I also love the many classic rock songs that were featured as part of the soundtrack.  Expect a lot of Allman Brothers Band, Joe Walsh, Elvin Bishop and Lynyrd Skynyrd songs to pop up from time to time.<br /><br />Overall: bloody, violent and constantly intense.  Just the way I like 'em!  Obviously the high point of Rob Zombie's career, and an underrated film in the humongous universe that makes up horror classics.  An amazing movie really.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Dark, Deep, Introspective Dose of Suspense"></head><body><p>A harsh, bitter, introspective survival picture that wasn't at all what I expected from the trailers. What the film chooses to do, it does very well - the suspense is so thick that my neck muscles remained in a stiff vice grip for hours, and the constant landscape shots are awe-inspiring - but those wildly successful qualities come at the expense of others. It's not a story with a firm resolution, which is sure to polarize a lot of viewers, and most of its intentions are left ambiguous. Liam Neeson is his typical commanding, badass self, but despite a few action hero moments he makes some boneheaded mistakes and his leadership qualities leave a lot to be desired. I've read that the plot is a metaphor for existentialism, which makes plenty of sense in reflection, but in the heat of the moment it feels desolate and hopeless. That innate duality makes it a complicated picture to rate; I wasn't oblivious to its faults, but still found it a dense, intriguing and enveloping experience. Worth watching, even if you wind up hating it.</p></body></html>

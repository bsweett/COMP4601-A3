Maybe my ignorance helped me enjoy the movie more than some. I thought the battle sequences were well done and the costuming excellent. Some of the characters didn't have much to do, while others we were given a good amount of depth to understand their motivations. Peter O'Toole owned the screen in his scene with Achilles asking for his son's body to be returned. Brad Pitt did a nice job with Achilles. The only complaint I have is the nihilistic way the character was written became a little irritating to deal with as the movie went on. Brian Cox is his usual nasty self as Agamemnon and it would have been nice to see Brendon Gleason have a bigger role as Menelaus.<br /><br />My biggest trouble with Troy is the almost 3 hour length. It didn't need to be that long. A few scenes cut out or shortened would have made a tighter movie. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Troy and would recommend it.</p></body></html>

The story hinges on Eli who is traveling west with a sacred book, which is coveted by the evil Gary Oldman who runs a wild west type of town.  The casting choices are good, and the script was solid.  The action was also very good.  The big reveal at the end was okay but didn't blow me away.  Something about the movie didn't quite grab me the way I thought it would.  I enjoyed watching it once, but I probably won't pick it up again.</p></body></html>

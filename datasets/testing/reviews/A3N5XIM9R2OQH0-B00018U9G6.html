It's fitting that the movie is filled with blatant AC/DC worship, because it's very much like one of that band's albums: it's excessive and often lowbrow, but you can't help but enjoy it because it's so full of energy and enthusiasm.  And most importantly of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Whether intentionally or not, director Richard Linklater and co. deal a major backhanded slap to all the sissified nu-metal and post-grunge "sensitive guy" bands currently dominating the airwaves, reminding us all that rock music is supposed to be fun and ultimately uplifting.<p>First of all, if "School Of Rock" doesn't make Jack Black a star, nothing will.  Black gives one of the most lovably over-the-top performances in history as Dewey Finn, an aspiring metal musician who poses as his friend Ned in order to get a substitute teaching job at a posh elementary school.  From the opening scene at a rock club, where Dewey launches into a frenzied guitar solo, whips off his shirt, and attempts a stage dive into an apathetic crowd, Black is a whirlwind of manic energy.  Much like Jim Carrey, Black doesn't just play the demented role: he means it, and the authenticity he brings to the movie makes all the diference.  Quick, think of another guy who could pull off the role this well.  This is Black's show, and he knows it.<p>When Dewey takes a position teaching the uptight children of uptight parents, the stage is set for a classic fish-out-of-water comedy.  Many of the movies' funniest moments come early on, when the overweight, disheveled Dewey and his privileged students can't quite figure out what to make of each other.  The plot?  Realizing that some of his students have musical talent, Dewey, under the guise of a school project, gets them to start up a rock outfit to compete at the local battle of the bands.  Along with the way he teaches them plenty about the history of rock and its value for, among other things, "fighting the man."  Naturally, the kids, their parents, and the school's principal (played by Joan Cusack, who would steal the movie if Black didn't), all learn valuable lessons about taking chances and enjoying life.  <p>This plot may sound rather hackneyed, but "School Of Rock" doesn't succeed by avoiding cliches; it succeeds my embracing them with all the vigor and passion of Dewey playing a guitar solo.  The movie's overbearing earnestness, which I typically find to be more of a turnoff than a woman with bigger muscles than me, turns out to be its greatest asset.  The reason?  Because "School Of Rock" conveys the too-often-forgotten lesson that people need to lighten up, and rock music has long been a valuable device for doing just that.  At its heart, the film's message is simple but enormously effective: that Rock 'n' Roll really just might be able to change the world.<p>It all comes to a head in the film's monster conclusion, with Dewey donning an Angus Young-styled schoolboy uniform for the Battle of the Bands.  Black absolutely owns the stage in this scene; there's no way the image of him performing won't be indelibly etched in the minds of all who see it.  If you know your stuff, you can also see the nods to Yes and The Clash in the kids' attire.  The song the band performs, fittingly titled "School Of Rock," is a lot like the movie itself: it's filled with rock cliches, but its youthful rebellion and energy more than make up for it.  It certainly beats much of what's on the radio today, just as the movie beats much of what's in your local multiplex.  Sometimes good intentions and inspired acting can carry a film, and "School of Rock" is one such example.</p></body></html>

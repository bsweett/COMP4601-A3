Telly (Moore) is still grieving for her nine year old son Sam who was killed in a plane crash three years before.  Her husband (Anthony Edwards) tries to be sympathetic to her crippled emotional state, and her therapist (Gary Sinese) gently tries to help her move on from the tragedy.  When Telly comes home to find that all the photographs containing Sam's image have vanished, with those of Telly and her husband as a couple in their place, she first blames her husband.  But Telly finds a much more complicated truth as all the evidence that Sam existed begins to disappear.  She teams up with an ex-hockey player, Ash, who shares a glimmer of memory of his own daughter, and together, they pursue an explanation<br /><br />Everything in this film comes easily, making the film flat and uninteresting.  The screenplay never digs deep enough to be satisfying and instead remains a glossy chase scene that ends with a breathless revelation that makes little sense. Moore has such a generalized expression of distress that it's difficult to imagine her as a mother desperate for her only child.  Sinese is much better as her quiet, contemplative therapist.  Dominic West as Ash is, well, (and you knew I had to say this before the end of my review) forgettable.<br /><br />Skip this one.  Even the weakest "The X-Files" episode was more compelling than this.</p></body></html>

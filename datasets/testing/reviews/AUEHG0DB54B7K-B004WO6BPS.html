<meta name="summary" content="The Dark Before the Dawn"></head><body><p>I have not read any of the Harry Potter books and so look at each of the films without knowing how they were adapted from page to screen.  As with any adaptation, there will be parts of the story that are changed or removed.  Part one of the final film is quite dark as Voldemort's power dominates the wizarding world. Harry, Ron and Hermione vow to find and destroy all of the Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort but they have little idea how to accomplish this.<br /><br />The film follows the battle between the forces of good and evil with evil winning. There are systematic efforts to get rid of wizards that do not agree with Voldemort's notions of pure blood.  Dumbledoor's supports are hunted down.  There are broadcasts where the names of captured or killed wizards are announced. The lack of hope pervades the film as Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced to hide in remote places. The locations chosen for their hiding places were visually stunning.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe turns in a good performance as does Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who shows a broader range of emotions in this film.  This film centers more on the characters of the three central wizards and they carry off the film very well.  They are supported by a host of British actors that mostly make very brief appearances. Bill Nighly has a brief part as Rufus Scrimgeour, but it is a pivotal one as he provides Harry, Ron and Hermione with items that can help them find the Horcruxes.  Imelda Staunton briefly reprises her role as Dolores Umbridge.  Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Isaacs were, as always, very good being evil.  In addition, Dobby makes a substantial appearance again appearing to help Harry in his time of need. The animation of Dobby (and the elf Kreecher) was much more life like than I recall from previous films.<br /><br />I did find that the film was a bit slow as Harry, Hermione and Ron hide out trying to discover what to do next.  These scenes added to the tense atmosphere of the film but were too long.  The suggestion was made by one reviewer that the movie is following the book on this point but on screen, it didn't quite work for me.  On the other hand, the scene where polyjuice is used to create multiple Potters is one of the delights of the film and adds a bit of humor to the serious trouble Harry is in.  I thought the animation that told the story of the Deathly Hallows was well done. The music by Alexander Desplait very much added to the mood of the film.</p></body></html>

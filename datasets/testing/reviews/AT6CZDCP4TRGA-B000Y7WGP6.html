Yep there are some stock Hollywood cliches especially during the somewhat slowish first 1/3, but the fight scenes of the last 1/3 of the film makes it all worth it, despite their fairly egregious implausibility.<br /><br />So suspend your considerable disbelief, and just kick back and enjoy the freeway chase, the neighborhood shootout and the apartment shootout especially the part featuring World Class Hot Babe Jennifer Garner putting a four inch blade into the back of some big burly A-rab's jihadi skull after he throws her around the room like a bag 'o potatoes.<br /><br />Along the way, there are some vague jabs at insight: we see that the Washington DC political establishment is very much in cahoots with the Saudi royals and that the Saudi royals are an equally dubious bunch; that the American diplomatic corps has no shortage of greasy careerist slimeballs; that the average American and the average Saudi both view each other's governments and cultures with comparable amounts of distrust and xenophobia, probably well-deserved; that both countries are in bed with each other for the same bottom-line economic and military conveniences, etc.  All quite reasonable and salient points no doubt, hardly original of course---but as one noted film critic pointed out, this is sort of like the "...For Dummies" version of "Syriana."<br /><br />In other words, the geopolitical backdrop is just a cool frame for all the state of the art bang-boom-bam boilerplate.  It's just loads of fun to watch the explosions and blood-splattering...I could watch the luscious Jennifer Garner running around in a snug and sweaty T-shirt with an automatic rifle in her hands dodging RPGs all day long!<br /><br />With the exception of Chris Cooper and the two lead Saudi guys (Ali Suliman and Ashraf Barhom), none of these guys are first-rate actors...but that's ok, director Peter Berg is smart enough to mostly spare them any overly challenging thespian moments, with lots of cutaways and jump cuts and cool music and visual atmospherics to keep us entertained.  The script has an admirably low number of clunkers for an action movie, too---not exactly Ingmar Bergman, but very few schmaltzy cringe-inducing moments, even at the end.  Don't know where this film was shot, but it does an excellent job of conjuring up the sights and sounds of Saudi Arabia which is a fascinating planet all unto itself.</p></body></html>

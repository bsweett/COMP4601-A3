<meta name="summary" content="Missing the heart and humor of the early Indy films"></head><body><p>Looking forward to a bit of Indiana Jones nostalgia, we rented this DVD with high hopes.  High expectations may be what thwarted us, but this one just didn't hold up to the original Indiana Jones trilogy.  There were dangerous insects, collapsing temples, car chases--all the requisite stuff for an Indy movie, but somehow the cleverness, the humor, and the heart were missing.  Interactions between Indy and his old girlfriend and her son were wooden and forced and didn't really get the viewer on board.  My favorite part was a sword fight between two men on fast-traveling, side-by-side jeeps, but much of the movie seemed like old stuff rehashed.  Harrison Ford is still Harrison Ford, though a bit older and grayer, and that was worth about 2 of the 3 stars.  Watch it if you must, but be forewarned that it is only a shadow of the first 3 movies in the series.</p></body></html>

I had not read any of the Stieg Larsson novels nor had I seen the earlier Swedish version of the film.  Obviously, I was aware of these versions.  However, I was perhaps wary that Hollywood was attempting to recreate something so soon after the original.<br /><br />Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo".  I found it to be dark, brooding and totally engrossing.  Time flew by.  I find that this is often one of the best indicators of a film's worth.<br /><br />The plot is probably well known to most.  I will not be repeating details nor, obviously, trying to compare it with the book or the original film.  Nonetheless, I can comment upon the cast and the broader screenplay.  In this regard, I found the lead actors to be excellent.  Rooney Mara as the rebellious and abused computer genius is a revelation.  She really does dominate the film.  Daniel Craig as the male lead, Mikael Blomkvist, is also good. This is not a James Bond role. He plays a real character with both strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />While the plot is arguably complex, it is easy for the viewer to follow. It has some wonderful twists.  All are explained without the viewer having to ask questions of others at the end of the production.<br /><br />Finally, the settings are also right on the money.  Mainly set in Sweden, the viewer is shown dark landscapes with little colour, These tie in nicely with the overall plot.  Nothing is out of place.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

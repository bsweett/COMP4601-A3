"Oldboy" is such a film, and to deny the fact that it captures raw and brutal emotion within it would be a disservice.  Whether you love the movie or despise it, you cannot argue with the fact that it will at some point hit a nerve.<br /><br />"Oldboy" tells the tale of Oh Dae-su, who at first sight is just a drunken babbling mess who gives no one any ounce of respect, not even the cops who have arrested him for his drunken and disorderly conduct.  He sings, calls them hideous swear words and sees no wrongdoing on his part.  After he leaves the station, he is abducted by unknown captors.  He is imprisoned in a strange and isolated room... for 15 years.  For those 15 years, he nearly loses his mind and wonders what misdeeds of his past has brought him to this horror.  After 15 years, he is released without any explanation or answers.  Oh Dae-su vows that he will find the truth and get revenge on anyone responsible for his imprisonment.  In fact, the whole point is that the captor is planning on Oh finding out the truth, as that is the whole point of his game.  Blood will be shed and devastating revelations will make their presence felt.<br /><br />"Oldboy" is a film unlike any I have ever seen.  Rarely have I ever seen a movie so dark, brutal and unrelenting--and yet be so beautiful at the same time.  You really do feel emotionally invested.  This is not a simple shoot-em-up revenge thriller.  It is something beyond that.  It poses questions and investigates the darker side of being human.  Not once did I feel myself losing interest.  The movie is superbly directed and acted.  There is a phenomenal fight scene where it's done in one complete shot, and without it being loud or flashy.  I also have to add that this film has one of the best and most haunting music scores since "Requiem for a Dream."<br /><br />Be warned, this isn't for everybody.  It is a dark movie and it does not let you off easy.  While it's not non-stop action and the movie focuses more on story and character, the violent scenes are really brutal.  You can watch it with an English dubbed track, but I encourage you to watch it with subtitles and see it in its original language.  Nowadays the English dubs do not do the films justice, as they change words and phrases around to make it seem more in sync with lip movement from the actors.  The Blu-Ray version of the film includes 2 disks.  There are some nice behind-the-scenes featurettes.<br /><br />"Oldboy" is a film that will leave its mark on you, no matter what your final judgment on the movie may be.  It takes "revenge" to a whole new and unexpected level and you'll have no idea where it's all leading to until the very end.  It's not for everybody, but if you're looking for something that's dark, intense, challenging and beautiful, give it a try.  You'll never look at revenge thrillers in the same way ever again.  Most likely, no other revenge thrillers will ever come close. - Michael Crane</p></body></html>

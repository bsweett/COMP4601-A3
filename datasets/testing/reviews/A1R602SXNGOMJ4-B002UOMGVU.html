<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic mob movie"></head><body><p>As a mobster movie fan, this is one of my all time favorites, next to the Godfather, of course.  This movie is based on the life of Henry Hill, a notorious mobster.  He starts off slow with small, petty crimes but quickly earns the trust of the higher ups.  All of the actors in this movie are excellent, especially Robert DeNiro.  If you like mob movies, you'll love this one.</p></body></html>

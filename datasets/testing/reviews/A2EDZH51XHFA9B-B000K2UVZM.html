It was also not that most of the principals in this movie were at best miscast. It wasn't even that the movie ended up not really being about the Black Dahlia case in any more than a subplot. No, upon reflection, I can't even say that the thing that most surprised me about it was that we had to have a twenty-minute "and so I have you all gathered in the room, and I shall now reveal who the killer is!" sequence. No, the thing that most surprised me about The Black Dahlia was that the crew who made this movie could, consciously or not, attempt a straight remake of L. A. Confidential and come up so hideously, horribly short.<br /><br />And yes, this might as well have been a remake of L. A. Confidential. All the same basic fetishes are there (though whether one can blame James Ellroy for this or those who adapt his books to the screen choosing to emphasize some points of his writing I don't know, as I've never read James Ellroy). The movie unfolds in the same manner, and the basic premise is so similar you could put Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe in Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett's roles and no one would know the difference. In fact, you'd probably have come up with a better movie; Josh Hartnett brings all the weight of obsession to this role that Jack Nicholson did to his in Sean Penn's woefully ineffective adaptation of The Pledge five years previous. Aaron Eckhart does a better job with the obsession angle, but he seems to have a problem getting anything else to work. There's the celebrity-lookalike angle, though Mia Kirshner and Hilary Swank, as has been commented on by, I believe, everyone who has reviewed this movie to date, look about as much alike as do a great dane and a haddock. (You decide which is which.) And, of course, there's the claustrophobic thirties cinematography. But where L. A. Confidential fires on every cylinder, The Black Dahlia is still trying to get out of the gate. Everything about it says it's a cheaper, low-rent knockoff. And then, of course, you get the "oh, this is how I solved the crime" phase, which should be outlawed in movies, and that just puts the cap on it.<br /><br />Could've been such a good movie. And ended up so mediocre. * ?</p></body></html>

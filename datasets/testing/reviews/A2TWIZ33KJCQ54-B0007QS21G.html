<meta name="summary" content="GOOD SCIENCE IT ISN'T: BUT IS STAR WARS OR SUPERMAN "GOOD SCIENCE""></head><body><p>IN A NUTSHELL: DOES IT REALLY MATTER THAT THIS IS "REEL-EE" BAD SCIENCE?<br /><br />Did it matter that "Independence Day" by the same Director had even less of a connection with possible future scenarios? NO, but "Independence Day" did not rely so heavily on special effects [though it was full of them] and therein lies part of the difference. "Independence Day" also had a unique chemistry that seemed to give it a connection to 50's-style, alien-invader flicks, thereby cultivating an affinity from those fans --including me.<br /><br />After all, does "Superman" [the "good alien invader"] need to be believable? - - - - -<br /><br />DOES STAR WARS NEED TO BE GOOD SCIENCE TO BELIEVE IN THE FILMS? DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE FORCE?<br /><br />Of course, the science is ridiculous in almost all of these speculative fiction flicks. Remember this is Hollywood film fiction and this fictional account is not "Gone With The Wind". On the other hand, I found "THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW" to be so much more watchable than "Men In Black" which suffered from an excess of humourous, flashy, fanciful, madcap, silly, glib and goofy moods to be watchable for me.<br /><br />This film appears to be trying at least to make a go of it. By that I mean making the unbelievable less, well, unbelievable. Dennis Quaid as a scientist-husband-father does well to keep us connected emotionally to the horrific events lending some much needed empathy to this spectacle. Ian Holm as the Brittish scientist is, well, Ian Holm; which is to say he always turns in a top-notch performance and his sequences are much needed in making the most unscientific theories work well enough to partially suspend our disbelief -- hopefully for at least 123 minutes.<br /><br />Going against the film is the obvious post-9/11 sentiment, making the destruction of American cities, shown principally to American audiences, somewhat worse than politically incorrect. To some people it may have seemed like rape victims watching a rape story movie, very sordid, but I did not realize that until I heard it from other people. Perhaps because I did not see the film until over 3 years after 9/11? If that is the case, the destruction of cities may be less offensive if you are NOW seeing the film for the first time, but that is just speculation.<br /><br />THE DVD & FEATURES<br /><br />Despite its inherent flaws, it plays somewhat interestingly, especially in this widescreen format. You can play it in "English", Spanish", and French" and there are subtitles available in English or Spanish. If you want the "DTS Surround Sound" this is available in English only. There are also some neat features like 2 separate commentary tracks and an hour-long featurette ["the making of"]. Of course there is the scene-selector feature and there are enough scenes that you won't have trouble getting to where you wish to go. There are also "deleted scenes" and an "audio anatomy-interactive sound demo".<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />The sound and video quality are great, which is as it should be on a new, high-budget release. The film is bad science, "reel" bad science, but it does retain a decent, and spectacular story, though more than a bit ridiculous. Ridiculous sometimes works in fantasy, though it is a bit harder sell in science fiction. In any event, the choice is up to us, the movie viewing public.<br /><br />Recently, this DVD has been heavily discounted and is now available widely for about half the original price, or about $10.00.</p></body></html>

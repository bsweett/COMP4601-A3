<meta name="summary" content="Berry Is The ONLY reason to watch this film!!!!!"></head><body><p>I rented this film not too long ago to see how terrible it was and I find that the criticism was mostly justified! I say mostly because I rather liked Halle's performance as Patience Phillips/Catwoman and not just for the suggestive poses and the skin tight leather! Her acting in this film is actually quite good in my view. Too bad the script sucked a*#! Her supporting cast was mediocre at best. Bennjamin Bratt (who is usually pretty good) was flat in this and Sharon Stone was just plain awful!<br /><br />I actually didn't mind that this was a different Catwoman but I though some nod to the previous character Selena Kyle should've been included somewhere.<br /><br />Overall, its not the WORST film in history but I wouldn't recommend it for a buy. A rental or if you must buy it, get it used or at a reduced price. Again, Halle is the only redeeming thing in this whole film for BOTH her effort as an actress (considering the script she was given) and the outfit! Beyond that, I can't really recommend this film.</p></body></html>

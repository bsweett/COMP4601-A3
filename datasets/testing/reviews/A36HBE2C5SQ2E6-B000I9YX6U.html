It was a very disturbing turn as Sal, a creepy photo guy from the pharmacy that takes a obession too far with a family that regularly comes in. He immerses himself into the family and calls himself Uncle Sal. the atmosphere was great and creepy and haunting. When you get done with the film, Willams' peformance will creep the hell out of you. Also, when the hotel scene comes up, be prepared because it is one of the most disturbing scenes in the whole movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend the film if you want to watch Robin Willams peform a serious role outstandingly.</p></body></html>

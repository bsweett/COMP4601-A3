On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in California to compete against two seasoned pros, McQueen gets to know the town's offbeat characters including Sally, a snazzy 2002 Porsche, Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past, and Mater, a rusty but trusty tow truck, who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship. The animation in this movie is gorgeous, and the story brings a smile to your face, and you can't help falling in love with all of the colorful characters. This is movie is worth seeing.</p></body></html>

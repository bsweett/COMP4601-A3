<meta name="summary" content="Even Mark Wahlberg couldn't save this one :-("></head><body><p>While I usually like M. Night Shyamalan's work, this was bad.  I also love Mark Wahlberg, but while he was my (only) highlight, he couldn't make me like this one.  It was impossibly and ridiculously bad.<br />Basically, Mark and his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and the daughter of a co-worker are literally running against the wind to try and save themselves from a strange and disturbing thing/phenomena that takes over peoples minds and makes them kill themselves.  At first it was assumend that it might be a terrorist attack, but with more and more people commiting suicide, it becomes clear that it's something else entirely.  I was so looking forward to watching this because the storyline to me, seemed enticing, but it wasn't and if I wasn't laughing at the stupidity of it all (the dialogue and the acting etc) then I was close to sleep with boredom.<br />Trust me, even if you are a fan of Shyamalan's work, this will surely disappoint.  If I were you, I'd wait until it was shown for free on TV and even then I'm not so sure.  Sorry.</p></body></html>

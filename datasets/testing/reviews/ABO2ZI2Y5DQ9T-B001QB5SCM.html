<meta name="summary" content="Being In My Sister's Shoes: Charming Drama with Good Acting of Three Ladies"></head><body><p>When theatrically released in America, `In Her Shoes' was not a big hit. Then it came to Japan, it was not a big hit either. It is a pity that not many people have seen this film because for all its flaws, `In Her Shoes' is a sweet, heart-warming film with good acting from the three ladies - Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, and Shirley Maclaine. Well, probably people thought the film is so-called `Chick-Flick.' (words I hate to use). It is, perhaps, but that does not mean a bad thing.<br /><br />The story is about two sisters -- Cameron Diaz's Maggie and Toni Collette's Rose. While Rose is very serious-minded and a little frumpy lawyer, Maggie is easy-going, fashionable, beautiful, but utterly self-centered and irresponsible. When Maggie is evicted from the house of her father, she goes to Rose's apartment, in which she `borrows' her sister's desinger clothes and expensive shoes without permission. And finally Maggie steps on the toes of Rose, by doing what you can predict in the first ten minutes by watching sexy Diaz roaming in the room.<br /><br />Again evicted from her sister's room In Philadelphia, Maggie heads for the south to seek for comfortable life, after finding that she has a grandmother she had never met. The grandma Ella (Shirley Maclaine), living in Florida's home for the old, welcomes Maggie, but she is also wise to detect the true purpose of her granddaughter's visit. In the meanwhile, Rose starts to have a date with a handsome but slightly geekish co-worker Simon (Mark Feuerstein), but it doesn't take long for her (and us) to realize that the presence (or absence) of Rose is the obstacle for her to begin a new life with him.<br /><br />It must be said that the script of Susannah Grant shows few unexpected developments in story itself. The film goes where you think it goes, and Curtis Hanson refrains from using obtruding skills in telling this simple story. Perhaps the film is too long (more than 2 hours), and perhaps the three ladies are typecast. Perhaps, and this is the most important, `In Her Shoes' wears its heart on its sleeve.<br /><br />However, I liked the film because it does wear its heart on its sleeve. And when the film moves us emotionally, it does so with complicated characters supported by the intelligently written dialogues. Flawed as they are, the characters, even minor ones like the charming old folks, come to be more and more endearing.<br /><br />`In Her Shoes' is a kind of film of which content you think you know before watching it. In a sense you are right. But that doesn't change the fact that this is a well-made, feel-good drama with the attractive cast and sophisticated line. It is sweet, maybe too sweet at times, but delightful all the same.</p></body></html>

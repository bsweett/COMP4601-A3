<meta name="summary" content="Good thriller with a surprising twist"></head><body><p>Skelton Key is a very eerie and dark thriller that takes place in the Louisanna bayous - the swamplands where all the old plantations still stand.<br /><br />They give the movie a dark feel because of thier dark past.<br /><br />Kate Hudson plays Caroline, a 25 year old girl who works in a nursing home, and becomes disillusioned by her job, and decides to do private nursing.<br /><br />She answers an ad for a private nurse, and it takes her to the plantation of an old "married couple".<br /><br />She is told that the man suffered a stroke and begins caring for him.<br /><br />She begins to suspect that the wife had something to do with his condition, and begins to investigate.<br /><br />This leads her into the world of "HooDoo"- A practice in the bayous that involves magic such as spells and potions etc.<br /><br />The movie really holds your attention as it takes you deeper and deeper into a web of dark secrets of this Husband and Wife, and thier long past of HooDoo.<br /><br />The last forty minutes or so of this movie has such a twist that it will blow your mind!<br /><br />Kate Hudson did an excellent job in her role, as did the rest of the cast<br /><br />but I think this was her best role yet.</p></body></html>

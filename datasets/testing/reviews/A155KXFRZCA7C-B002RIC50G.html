<meta name="summary" content="A thrilling Journey of merciless Revenge"></head><body><p>Finally, again a thriller that has it all: suspense, style, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, great photography, first-class acting, and a very good soundtrack. This Hannibal edition is the perfect precursor to Silence of the Lambs. Gaspard Ulliel as young Hannibal Lecter is superb - you can't ask for more, ... an extremely talented actor.<br /><br />The exotic touch comes through Gong Li who once again delivers an excellent performance just like in the recent Miami Vice picture. The incorporation of some minor japanese mysticism is also a nice touch and adds flavor to this superb thriller. The ambience and mood in this flick is very well captured and the select effective closeups are what good movies are made of.<br /><br />Although there were only four people in the theatre we went to, fans of thrillers should go and see this film and they will thoroughly enjoy it. I watch a lot of films and usually I only like one or two each year, and Hannibal Rising is really movie making at its best in this genre. The story line is also very good and provides the perfect backdrop to the latter Hannibal Lecter as it all comes together now: the creation of a merciless monster/cannibalistic serial killer. Once released as DVD, this film is certainly a must for every DVD collection. Five stars all the way.</p></body></html>

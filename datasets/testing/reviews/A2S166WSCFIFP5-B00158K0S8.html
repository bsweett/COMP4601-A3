Scott's greatest (though his greatest is still Dr. Strangelove). It is a well written, well shot, well directed (this is the man who made Planet of the Apes) film that won a great many awards. There are some great action sequences and some fine acting moments. <p>The dvd is a little weak. There are a few trailers: Tora Tora Tora and The Longest Day, which are good choices and and audio essay, but it never played on my dvd. I don't know if that is just my copy or a flaw in them all. And that's it. No featurettes, documentaries, nothing else. A film this great deserves a little more care in packaging the dvd.</p></body></html>

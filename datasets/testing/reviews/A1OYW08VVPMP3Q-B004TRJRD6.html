A good, strong story the Exorcist is about a young girl who becomes possessed by a demon (or something!) and her mother seeks out a Catholic priest to perform an exorcism to banish it. The acting in the film is first-rate and makes the characters feel real where many movies like this would have made them 2-dimensional. The videography was also awesome. The only two weaknesses I feel is the pace of the film (which is slow at some parts but it allows for good character development) and some plot points which never seem resolved. They are minor but irritating. For instance, what was the relevency to the opening location? You never really find out but I'm sure the novel probably makes it clear. Well worth watching!</p></body></html>

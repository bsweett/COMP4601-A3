<meta name="summary" content="Coughing up blood..."></head><body><p>`Oldeuboi' tells the twisted tale of a man named Dae-su Oh who is imprisoned for fifteen years with no understanding as to why only to be released suddenly, left to ponder the realities of his situation while seeking unlawful revenge on the man who stole such a large chunk of his life from him.<br /><br />I don't even want to begin to hint at the films final revelations, for they are best served as a complete surprise.<br /><br />Oh, but how delicious is heated debate, so I'm going to do my best to elaborate as ambiguously as possible here.<br /><br />The film is a total morality tale, but it is, in the end, something completely devoid of all morals.  The character of Dae-su Oh is a drunk and a disorderly man (as witnessed by the opening scene as well as by news reports overheard shortly thereafter).  He has left a long trail of enemies (he himself finds it most difficult to narrow down the list of suspects in his search for his captor) and has cataloged a long list of personal failings on his part.  He is, as he put it himself, nothing more than a beast.  The thing is, when all is said and done, Dae-su Oh seems very human to the audience.  When you take someone who is reportedly undesirable and then do awful things to them they become somewhat sympathetic, don't they?  If you doubt my words then ask yourself why you don't hate him when the credits begin to roll, because you know why he did what he did and it should repulse you.  Another thing I find simply remarkable is the `reason' for which all of these things take place is not anything that Dae-su Oh even recalls.  As his aggressor puts it, it wasn't important to him and so he simply forgot; end of discussion.  The fact that it wasn't of any importance to Dae-su Oh is something of grave importance for it outlines the very fact that our actions, no matter how innocent in texture, have lasting and at times devastating outcomes.<br /><br />But then again, it's not like Dae-su Oh is completely to blame for that tragedy.<br /><br />If you are reading this and have as of yet to see this remarkable film, watch it tonight.<br /><br />The film could be (ignorantly) labeled an action film.  Well, it is one to a certain extent, but Chan-wook Park really proves that there is no bounds to the amount of emotional depth one can heap upon a certain genre.  Not many action films contain this much poignancy and remain this harrowing.  The action scenes (which can get ridiculously brutal) are perfectly balanced in tone to never once convey a sense of surrealism.  This film is very real.  The violence is handled with care to remain something feasible.  The film never dips into CGI mode (thank the heavens).  The acting is also a standout.  The lead performance, delivered by Min-sik Choi, is so layered it is unforgettable (especially that breakdown sequence with the whole `dog' transformation).  Yes, he is angry and vengeful, but he is never one-note.  The amount of emotional transference noted in a single facial expression is bountiful.<br /><br />The final reveal in `Oldeuboi' is heart stopping and it may leave a sour taste in your mouth, but it is all par for the course and serves as an unforgettable way to make a lasting impression, and raise very complex question:<br /><br />"And now... now, what joy will I have left to live for?"</p></body></html>

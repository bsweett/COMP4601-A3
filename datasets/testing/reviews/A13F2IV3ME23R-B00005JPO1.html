<meta name="summary" content="OH GRUMBLE - GRUMBLE - GRUMBLE - WHAT DO YOU WANT?"></head><body><p>This movie of Indiana Jones hits the spot ---- ENTERTAINMENT ----<br />In theory this story takes place 17 or 19 years after the first one?<br />HARRISON FORD is INDIANA JONES -- Well Jones is a character.  He has a innocent humor which makes the story hum.<br /><br />Marion is back and just as gutsy as ever - and boy what a shocker she unloaded on Jones.<br /><br />The colour, the scenes, the action [without pulling any of it apart] make for a fascinating, entertaining trip into enjoyment.<br /><br />Lucas - Speilburg - Ford make the most entertaining movies worth watching.<br />Hey, what happened to Han Solo and his offspring?  Jones beat him to it.<br /><br />Come on guys give us one more with Jones showing the ropes to Jr. on finding the lost treasures.  Mom can stay home with the twin boys and the baby daughter. [grin]  He must still be horseback riding - howabout setting out west and Indian territory.  Some body must have lost something.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie and will be watching it over again many times. I love good, clean action adventure.</p></body></html>

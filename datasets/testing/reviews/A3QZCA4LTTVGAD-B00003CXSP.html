And was I in for a surprise. I found &quot;Hannibal&quot; to be more of a grotesque comedy than a true horror film. Still, the film has genuine suspense and gross-out thrills.<p>Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Hannibal, the cannibalistic serial killer, and he is clearly having fun. Unlike the first film, &quot;Hannibal&quot; begins with the title character free and living the good life in Italy. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster in the pivotal role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, who hunts for Hannibal (and, I might add, she's quite good in the role).<p>But Hannibal is also being hunted by the agents of Mason Verger, a &quot;reformed&quot; child molester who was repulsively mutilated by Hannibal and who wants revenge. Gary Oldman clearly relishes this outrageous role, and the make-up effects for this character are truly spellbinding. Verger's fiendish plans for Hannibal involve a herd of man-eating pigs. Add to the mix Giancarlo Giannini as an avaricious Italian cop on Hannibal's trail and Ray Liotta as Starling's sleazeball colleague, and you have a truly Jerry Springer-ish collection of oddballs.<p>Some bemoaned the film's gore, but I found &quot;Hannibal&quot; to be an outrageous good time. In fact, the violence is so absurdly baroque that it is funny--&quot;Hannibal&quot; plays almost like a coolly intelligent spoof of &quot;splatter&quot; films. And the exquisite musical score and locales add to the filmgoer's pleasure quotient.<p>No, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is not in the same league as &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; which is a true landmark of horror and suspense cinema. But this film is a unique thrill ride of its own.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Didn't live up to expectations, but definitely worth viewing"></head><body><p>Started out slowly for me, as I felt like I was watching Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep act, rather than feeling like they were the actual characters. But as the movie moved along, I did find myself slowly giving in to the story (and the performances). Amy Adams is adequate in the third lead role, but the movie is almost stolen away by Viola Davis (even though she's only on screen for about 8-10 minutes). The film certainly raises good points that we still grapple with today - personal certainty versus actual proof (ie. Bush administration and WMD's). The biggest misstep in the movie for me comes in the very last scene, which I won't give away, but to me seemed very out of character and weakened the whole movie.</p></body></html>

I guess it's what used to be called a melodrama. It's a word that seems out of use today but fits this movie perfectly.<br /><br />It's about two sisters who are very different from each other. Cameron Diaz plays Maggie, who enjoys a life of dalliances and trifling experiences. Her sister Rose is played by Toni Collette. She is a serious lawyer who used to make herself feel better by food and has turned to shoes. Both Maggie and Rose are trying to fill a void in their lives. But it's Rose that has to bail Maggie out of trouble and is tired of it. She wants a real life. Their fragile relationship is damaged when Maggie has a fling with Rose's suitor...or at least Rose wants him to be a suitor. They lose touch with each other when Maggie decides to go to her long lost grandmother.<br /><br />This is a great rainy afternoon movie that maybe some sensitive guys can get into as well (but I wouldn't count on it!). Get some ice cream and curl up on the sofa or in the bed and enjoy!</p></body></html>

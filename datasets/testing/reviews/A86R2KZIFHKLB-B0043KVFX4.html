<meta name="summary" content="Still watchable"></head><body><p>This is still a watchable film, and it entertains. Much of these ideas have been done before. We have govt experiments gone disasterously wrong, the world laid waste like a mad max movie, throw in zombies, zombie animals, warrior babe, Tk abilities, mad scientists, mad scientist run amok, bloody gore, cloning, world revelations, mix this all in a pot set to boil, and you have a movie! Not terribly original, but entertaining none the less</p></body></html>

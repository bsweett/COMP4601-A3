<meta name="summary" content="Where did this film come from?  How could I have missed it?"></head><body><p>I guess there are times you don't read the reviews in the paper, don't see any theatrical trailers, and don't hear ANYTHING.<br /><br />When this film showed up, it must have been one of those times.<br /><br />This is a great film, full of comedy and tragedy, great acting, unpredictable plot twists, sleezeballs, heroes, and more.  Joan Allen and Kevin Costner are great in this as a couple of drunken neighbors looking for comfort.  Director Mike Binder, who also plays the sleezeball, puts together a story of tremendous "watchability."  It's hypnotic... you can't keep yourself from wanting to know what happens next.  Watch for the nose falling in the soup... literally.<br /><br />Five stars.  If you don't watch the deleted scenes, it is a PG-13 rating.  Enjoy.</p></body></html>

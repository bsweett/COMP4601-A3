Brown<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn; based on the comic book by Mark Miller and John Romita Jr.<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Matthew Vaughn<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Comedy<br />Release Date: 17 April 2010<br />Review Date: 22 April 2010<br /><br />I think it's fair to say that most of us have seen a movie or two that displayed all of its greatest achievements in the trailer. This holds particularly true to films of the comedic genre. Kick-Ass however, had the exact opposite effect. Based on its trailer, I was more than skeptical. I was wondering what Nicolas Cage was doing in a film like this. Man, was I surprised.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes or so had me let down and I was sure the film was gonna be a total drag. But then, out of nowhere, I was completely taken aback by a sharp turn in the tone of the film, and was rolling with laughter from there all the way to its hilarious climax. The fact that the trailer also led me to believe that it was only rated PG - 13, was another genuine treat. It's very much rated R.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson stars as your everyday American high school kid, David. David fantasizes about his teacher, the hot girl in school, and of course what it would be like to have super powers. The latter causes him to ask himself why no-one has ever tried being a superhero without any powers. He shall like to be the first. He orders a costume off the internet and goes to work to fight crime.<br /><br />He looks absolutely ridiculous in his hideous pine green and yellow ninja looking outfit, but that's what makes the film fun. It's called Kick-Ass folks, so if you are taking the time to watch the film, you can't exactly expect it to be Oscar-worthy now can you? Oh yeah, and it's called Kick-Ass, because that's the superhero name he deems himself with.<br /><br />When David finds himself ready to due battle against two local punks, while dressed in his costume of course, we are rooting for him. We expect he will actually take be able to take them down. We expect pretty much anything other than what actually happens, to happen! This would be the 90 degree turn the film takes that I was referring to earlier. We go from a comedy, to a very dark comedy laced with buckets and buckets of blood brought forth from hilarious scenes of violence.<br /><br />There are additional characters in the film, who I found even more appealing than David. Nicolas Cage plays a single father raising his 11-year-old daughter. We meet them in one of the most creative and humorous scenes that I have ever seen and I won't spoil it for you. It's safe to say that only Nicolas Cage could have pulled the scene off as good as he does, and still have us liking the character.<br /><br />Cage and his daughter (Chloe Moretz) play Big Daddy and Hit Girl. They two are masked avengers of justice, and are far better at it than David. Their costumes are so B-rate, that they are in fact genius, and will no doubt be among the most popular come this Halloween.<br /><br />Bid Daddy has trained Hit Girl to be the ultimate crime fighting machine. In addition to that, he's also taught her a long list of choice four-lettered words, to which she delivers with a classic juvenile charm.<br /><br />What so many people have found absurd and offensive about this, is what I appreciated most about the film. The violence that is depicted here isn't exactly what you would call your everyday comic-book movie violence. Hit Girl and Big Daddy brutally murder every bad guy they come across. It may sound strange and twisted, but seeing it in this film, it is hysterical. Cage and Moretz are both sensational actors and are perfect for these roles. They steal the show in every scene and a star has been born in Chloe Moretz.<br /><br />When a ruthless mob boss (Mark Strong) has had enough of the mysterious crime fighters spoiling his plans, he puts forth a counterstrike to trap them, using Kick-Ass. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell.<br /><br />There are a few things wrong with the film, and even though it's ridiculous, I know they could have written it better. Some jokes were missed and or executed poorly and at times the dialogue wasn't what it could have been either. Nonetheless there are so many genuine laughs, that we are still able to enjoy the film.<br /><br />If you have been told you don't have an open mind, then skip this film. It has been ridiculed by far too many uptight cry-babies and it needs to stop. Don't sabotage a good thing. The film is absurd but it wants to be, and its fans prefer it to be. So leave it alone, or I'll (insert this film title with the word your implanted in the middle of it, and then smile.:)</p></body></html>

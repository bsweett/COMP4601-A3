Or since we're discussing poor Jimmy McTeigue's awkward, mind-numbingly dull lobotomy of Alan Moore's brilliant and haunting "V for Vendetta"---and since it's set in not-so-jolly-old-England in the hazy, crazy future---then, in the spirit of the Cockney dialect why don't we just call it "F for Foooking Awful"?<br /><br />Try  "B for Bowdlerized": the cinematic "V" is one plopped into the digital blender and stripped of its drama, boiled down, recycled, pureed, bled dry of its horrible irony and all too balefully human black heart.<br /><br />McTeigue cut his teeth setting up the slick action shots for the Matrix flicks, and it shows: in "V" there is a doozy of a fight sequence, and it's a bracing example of what the flick might have been---balletic, nimble, unapologetically brutal, almost graceful.<br /><br />But then McTeigue---and his well-heeled handlers, the gender-bending Wachowskis---get down to business: sticking it to G.W. Bush and those fiendish Americans!<br /><br />The story, which needed no fiddling, is fiddled with, the better to make Hugo Weaving's black-hatted Hamlet a white-helmeted paragon of Freedom: the sinister, blighted landscape of post-Apocalyptic Britain at the guts of the graphic novel is replaced by a UK gone fascist after a bout of nasty pox. Evey is no longer a prostitute, with nowhere to turn: now she's a pert, preppy, abs-and-thighs of steel -production assistant.<br /><br />And so: gone is the dark, wicked, twisted, nimble brilliance of Alan Moore's sinister diptych set in a post-apocalyptic totalitarian England, replaced by something that plays like a "V" Cliff's Notes for the terminally ADHD-set.<br /><br />S for Subtext! The Wachowskis really hate George W. Bush! We get it!<br /><br />F is for Fashionable, baby, Yeah! Terrorism is, like, you know, the new Black! It has a real thinning effect! And nothing brings a people together more than blowing up an historic national landmark with a tube-train filled to the brim with fertilizer bombs---does that mean Tim McVeigh is a posthumous performance artist?<br /><br />H for Hot! With that in mind, when she's not emoting her pretty little skull off or crying or writhing around on the ground in her cute little prison smock, clasping her little shaved-like-a-peach head---well God, blokes, is Natalie Portman not one peachy bird, baby? Yeah! I know the next time I dial up Madama Helga's I'll have to remember "V" and ask for the "Portman Schoolgirl Special". Rowrrrr, baby, behave!<br /><br />T for Teeth: as in, Jesus F*cking Christ the English have bad Teeth! When V's Halloween-party army takes over and the morning-after shivers wear off, the first act of legislation the new Government of the People should pass is one of free orthodontics: if whatever they were doing over at Larkhill caused these plaguey-bad choppers, then V was onto something, after all!<br /><br />Oh yes, and T for Thespians, too! Whatever "V"'s faults, the acting is nearly sublime: all hands man their battle stations, and go down with this reeking turd---but throw out some fine performances along the way. Portman turns in the performance of her career as Evey; Stephen Rea (Finch) sulks his way through another flick; Stephen Fry (the snaggle-toothed Gordon) rejoices that he's at least not in "Gosford Park"; John Hurt (Sutler) twirls his mustachios; and Hugo Weaving phones it in from beneath a heart---or face, anyway---of Oak.<br /><br />D for Deep Pockets! As in, where the h*ll did the freewheeling, itinerant V get enough money to afford Guy Fawkes costumes for the entire population of the British Isles? And come to think of it, wouldn't that sort of order have attracted notice? "Made to order: 20 million Guy Fawkes outfits. COD."<br /><br />B for Burkha! Which is what all the popcorn chomping cuties who left the theater wondering why the action quotient wasn't higher had better start fitting themselves for, if the general consensus is that terrorism is cool, blowing buildings up is groovy, and that the Koran is our flipbook for freedom.<br /><br />In the end, it's all M for Mediocrity, and more's the pity. Our shadowy latter-day Guy Fawkes does what he has to do, and serves as an exemplar of stealthy, shadowy urban terror: setting off fertilizer bombs in the bowels of London, whacking the errant, gouty, ulcerated perverted Archbishop (aren't they all, nowadays?), strapping himself up with TNT and parading into a broadcast booth, slitting throats with gay abandon.<br /><br />But the Wachowskis have deprived their Shakespearean anarachist of a suitable foe. In Moore's original, the dictator Adam Susan (renamed Sutler in the cinematic outing, so as to further underscore the Hitler/Bush parallel to the brain-challenged in the audience) was a worthy adversary, if only because he was just as deranged as V, and as equally devoted to his outsized notions of Order as V was to his unrequited love for abstracts like Justice and Liberty: arguably, they were mirror images.<br /><br />It's amusing that "V" gets raves for thumbing its wooden nose at Bush's America, where even illegal aliens feel free to march for their 'rights'---when this very instant in the Sudan---surely V's anarchic state of nature, a realm where the people are assuredly *not* afraid of their government because it no longer exists---men are slaughtered for the mistake of belonging to the wrong tribe.<br /><br />"V" might have landed a roundhouse if it had pitted its Angel of Righteous Destruction against a truly committed avatar of Order---not the ranting Hitler-lite Sutler. Sadly, "V"'s latter-day Guy Fawkes---reduced each year to a straw-man, and burned in effigy---is pitted against an even more hopeless Straw Man, and the film dies for it.<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is ultimately crucified on a cross of mediocrity.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

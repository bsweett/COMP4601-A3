<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Saw Movies"></head><body><p>Saw III picks up right where II left off and then forwards goes six months ahead, a new victim is discovered is an inescapable trap. Usually "patients" of John "Jigsaw" Kramer can escape the games; this time the trap is unusual which brings questions about the inventor of this trap. Saw III is basically a large and complicated game much like the first movie. Jigsaw is dying and Amanda brings in Doctor Lynn Denlon who has to keep him alive for the game's length in order to succeed her game. Meanwhile her husband Jeff is the one playing the "real" game which will decide of everyone's fate. This one is also Amanda's big test even if she doesn't know it. The fact that Saw III is so complex, logical and that it makes sense at the same is quite an accomplishment for a horror movie as they rather ignore connectivity from a movie to another, Saw does not. It's obvious that with this third movie they tried to end the trilogy while knowing that there might be a next movie, they could have ended Saw right there if they wanted to. It is the most profitable Saw movie to date having earned an estimated total of $164,874,275 worldwide.<br /><br />I feel this is one of the better Saw movies, first of all it has a great story and its complicated which I think is what fans will love about it. Secondly why someone may or may not like it is because it's the goriest of the Saw movies in my opinion, the traps are amazing I felt they put in some extra effort for those.</p></body></html>

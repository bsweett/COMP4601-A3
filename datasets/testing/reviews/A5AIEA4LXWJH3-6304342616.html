<meta name="summary" content="Great Video and Audio"></head><body><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video quality is great, except for just a few scenes, which had some grain.  I would give it a 9 to 9.5 on a 10 point scale.<br /><br />The audio, which is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, is also great.  Lot's of sound coming from all the speakers, including the sub-woofers.<br /><br />I am very happy to have this movie on Blu-Ray.  I am very satisfied with the audio and video quality.</p></body></html>

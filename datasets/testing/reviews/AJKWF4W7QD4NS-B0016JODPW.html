Philip Seymour Hoffman stars as Andy, a desperate and drug raddled payroll executive who convinces his cash-strapped brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) to pull off what could be the perfect crime.  The crime is knocking off a mom and pop jewelry store, that just so happens to be run by their actual parents (Albert Finney and Rosemarry Harris).  That's what makes it perfect: mom and dad get taken care of via insurance, and Andy and Hank's money problems are taken care of.  However, things don't go as planned, and quickly spiral out of control, leading to a climax that you may not see coming.  Though the script from Kelly Masterson tends to rely a little heavily on the whole "repeat scenes from different perspectives", it works very well in Lumet's hands, and the work from the cast is nothing short of superb.  Hoffman, Hawke, and Finney are wonderful and magnetic, while Marisa Tomei delivers a sympathetic performance as Andy's long suffering wife.  Even relatively minor roles from Michael Shannon, Brian F. O'Byrne, and Amy Ryan manage to be memorable.  All in all, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a spectacularly dark and absorbing film from the legendary Sidney Lumet that deserves your attention.</p></body></html>

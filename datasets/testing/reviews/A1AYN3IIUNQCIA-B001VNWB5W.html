<meta name="summary" content="So Far, One of The Best This Year"></head><body><p>When I first saw the trailer for Watchmen, I was whiped into a tizzy and immediatly had to rush out and get the graphic novel, instantly hooking myself into the world of the Watchmen and become a hardcore fan. When it finally came out that March day, I saw it twice and each time was completley blown away. Becoming one of those rare movies to be faithfully adapted and still retail some of its hardcore punch, Watchmen is in my opinion one of the best films of the year, perhaps even one of the best comic book movies ever made.<br /><br />Set in an alternate universe from our own, superhereos are pretty common place until a law is passed banning them from doing any more super work. When one of these supers, The Comedian, is murdered, it sets into motion a series of events that will have the world hanging on the crises and forcing these retired heroes back into action.<br /><br />Once again, Zack Snyder employs a similiar method he used for 300, with the whole greenscreen effect and once again it works beautifully. Each scene just jumps right at you, you are submersed into this grainy underworld that occasionally pops with brillinatly flashes of color (most obviously the yellow) and the effects are pretty damn amazing. Visually, it achieves on all fronts.<br /><br />And I have to point out the choice of music was absolutly spot on. I cannot listen to Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are a-Changin" without imagining the opening credits, which by the one are one of the many highlights of the film.<br /><br />What seperates Watchmen from other superhero/comic movies is the amazing psychological depths of the characters, profiles that you rarely ever see in these type of films (the other obvious example being the Batman series). With the likes of the Comedian, a typically vile character who you want to feel no sympathy for or Nite Owl, who is very spineless and docile, these characters could have easily been one dimensional and stagnat, but there were so many other layers to them, not just these outside conceptions but deeper, more thoughtful ideas that show more to each of the characters. And this kind of thing is certaintly not lost in the transition from book to screen, with each one holding just as much of their psychological profile and character traits that give the movie so much more then just an action/comic forray.<br /><br />With that in mind, every actor is great in the film, with defintinly the one standing out being Jackie Earl Haley as the violent Rorscache. Already my favorite from the comic, Haley goes above and beyond bringing him to life, adding so much more to the character then was seen in the comic, which is really saying something. He to me has become the new Joker of the year.<br /><br />I was a bit shocked at the sort of lukewarm reception the film got, but then again it wasn't like I didn't expect it. Watchmen the comic is going to be universally great because of its impact but the film is definintly going to split people, its just another one of those love it or hate it films, with me falling on the love it side. But truly, this is one of the must see films this year and once you view it, then you can make up your mind on it. Hopefully, you'll be like me and find it one of the most rewarding and satisfying films this year.</p></body></html>

The fact that the film was set in the 1920's, the decade when King Tut's glorious tomb was discovered, rather than modern times boosts The Mummy's authenticity and effectiveness.<br /><br />The movie opens in ancient Egypt, where the Pharaoh's most powerful and trusted priest, Imhotep is carrying on a passionate affair with his boss's beloved mistress, played by the jaw-droppingly hot Patricia Velasquez.  The lovebirds murder the Pharaoh, but are caught.  Ahnk Sunamun plunges a sword into her belly, and Imhotep is sentenced to the worst punishment of all.<br /><br />Fast-forward to 1923.  The nerdy but lovely Evie (Rachel Weisz) is a cryptologist and specialist in ancient Egyptian.  She saves rakish adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) from hanging, and together with her brother set out to find the legendary city of Hamunaptra.  They are dogged by competition, other adventurers seeking the fabled city and its treasure.  Unbeknownst to them, they are watched by the Med Jai warriors, sworn to make sure Amun Hotep is never accidentally awakened by any of these adventurers.<br /><br />Well, needless to say, the evil creature is awakened by the bumbling adventurers, releasing the plagues of Egypt on the population, and seeking to make them his slaves.  How will Imhotep - now the Mummy - be stopped?<br /><br />Two minor characters add so much to the film.  The smoldering and athletic Oded Fehr as Med Jai warrior Arded Bey, and the hilarious Omid Djalili as an unscrupulous and oversexed prison warden.</p></body></html>

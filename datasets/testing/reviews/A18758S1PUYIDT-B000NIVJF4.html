Some very disturbing and gruesome scenes which are, fortunately for us viewers, brief.  I wasn't too sure at first why there had to be a fictional character, the Scottish doctor, involved at all, but through him we gain a better perspective of what it was like to have to live with Amin.</p></body></html>

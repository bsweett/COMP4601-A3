'Nemesis' is probably the pitiful death-kneel of a once-proud franchise that was driven into the ground by a group of people at Paramount (led by Rick Berman) that just have little or no idea what made Star Trek so endearing.<br /><br />The acting is just terrible. Patrick Stewart just looks like he's going through the motions. I think it's clear that he wants to move on to other things.  Creatively, I think he's visibly bored.  Jonathan Frakes is a TV actor and still hasn't made a comfortable leap to the big screen, and Michael Dorn's Worf has basically become a Klingon stereotype. This brings me to the sad story of Data. First of all, you can't spend almost 16 years playing out the whole Pinocchio storyline with Data. All of those "I don't understand humanity and yet aspire to be human" moments have stopped being endearing quite some time ago, now they're just annoying. His big scene at the end of the movie (I'm really trying not to drop any spoilers) was just totally devoid of any kind of emotion (or emotional impact) at all. His dual role as B-4 (get it? "Before") is just terrible, clearly done just in case there's a sequel. The rest of the crew make a cameo, but are essentially given absolutely nothing to do.  Buried in the void of this film are also Dina Meyer and Ron Perlman.  You'd honestly never know they were there.<br /><br />When 'Nemesis' was being made I had a glimmer of hope for the film.  I thought that bringing on director Stuart Baird as a fresh start was a good way to move off of a creative rut I saw the franchise in.  Baird was a long-time understudy of Richard Donner, so I thought, at worst, the film would be exciting.  It didn't work at all though.  One of the reasons that Star Trek works is because of its attention to detail and the ability to respect its own continuity and rules.  'Nemesis', unfortunately, didn't do any of that.<br /><br />The plot is riddled with conflicts of logic. Shinzon is the double for Picard and explains that "other then his jaw and nose being broken years ago, they look identical"? What? This guy's face is as smooth as silk! If anyone could have gotten away with that kind of a statement, it should probably have been Picard! Stewart, just be virtue of being older, could very easily have had those injuries in his youth.<br /><br />How could the Enterprise have rammed a vessel when they had no shields and the opponent's shields were at 70%? Wouldn't the Enterprise have just broken up on the front of the other ship? I also love villains who cart around a Death-star caliber weapon and don't use it. I could actually keep going too; this is just the short list!<br /><br />So far the Next Generation movies are just 1 for 4 with 'First Contact' being their only redeeming moment. Gene Roddenberry would be turning in his grave if he knew the state his beloved franchise was in right now. I'm actually praying that there isn't an 11th movie. If there is, there had better be a complete, top-to-bottom turnover in its creative team right up to Rick Berman. What they have now is just NOT getting the job done</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a REAL slice of "reality!""></head><body><p>Since we all know what choreographed horse-dung most "reality" shows are these days, it is downright refreshing to watch a movie that skillfully conveys a time, a place, and a group of people as well as this film captures Gulf War One.  You remember, the time we actually won, actually GOT "Mission Accomplished" with barely a few scratches (well, ok there were a few hundred casualties but 90% by accidents, friendly fire or by the one Scud missile that hit an Army barracks).  Yes, THAT war---led by the elder Bush not his idiot son, and where our troops were truly greeted as liberators.<br /><br />Problem was, for the boots on the ground, Gulf War One was really one long tedious slog leading up to a total anti-climax.  The only American combat personnel to really see much action were the air force, who did most of the work ahead of the ground forces.  Oh, were all wars for oil so easy and painless!  Sam Mendes, director of the highly acclaimed "American Beauty," does a fine job of capturing exactly what that experience was like, mostly from the perspective of a brighter-than-average 20 year recruit played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a slightly absurdist anti-hero who quickly regrets his decision to volunteer which he later describes as, "I got lost on the way to college."<br /><br />Yes there are allusions to other classic war movies, and there are a number of parallels with the movie that the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr correctly called "the greatest war movie of all time:" Stanley Kubrick's masterful "Full Metal Jacket" which this movie predictably cannot match.  Yet it is far from a failure, as some reviwers have claimed---Mendes has achieved enough clout and independence as a filmmaker to not have to pander to the lowest common denominator audience's eternal desire for easily recognizable good guys, bad guys, and uplifting endings.  What we get instead is a vivid and generally very entertaining portrait of men trained and then thrown into a war that actually wasn't much of a war.<br /><br />Mendes certainly does share some subtle anti-war sentiments, but that does not prevent him from admiring the devotion that men develop for their fellow soldiers, which is the one thing that keeps them in battles that they often know are totally absurd and unnecessary, and keeps them from rebelling against commanding officers, generals and politicians who usually have far more ego than intelligence.  He also does a fine job of exposing the viewer to the very unglamorous realities of military daily life and military culture and the animalistic group dynamics that develop between young men thrown together into that type of environment.<br /><br />So those viewers looking for a nice kiss-the-flag exercise in sentimental patriotism will surely be disappointed, as will those violence junkies hoping to see some satisfying combat scenes---there really aren't any.  Mendes goes to great pains to NOT commercialize or cosmetize violence, and this is perhaps the reason why he has been accused of making a "cold" and "distanced" film in some quarters.  For instance, he chooses to show us the charred and smoking aftermath of the "Highway of Death" massacre in which US aircraft slaughtered thousands of Iraqis fleeing Kuwait ahead of the American invasion instead of the actual massacre itself.  What many viewers and reviewers seem to overlook is that in this day and age, with our modern air-based weaponry, much of war itself IS very much "cold" and "distanced"---at least the wars that we still win quickly and convincingly.<br /><br />"Jarhead" is most enjoyable if you have some appetite for dark and absurdist humor, and do not insist that every movie have the same predictable Hollywood 3-act plot lines and focus-group hooks.  Yes there are a few somewhat clunky moments but there are also some exquisitely bittersweet ones, such as when a Vietnam USMC vet hops on the homecoming bus for the returning soldiers and tries in vain to bond with them.  A Steven Spielberg or other such director would not have been able to resist turning that into some tear-jerking, crowd-pleasing ending---Mendes has the cojones and the artistic integrity to just tell it like it is, even if the audience would much prefer to get their rocks off through the usual tricks and cliches.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent DVD of an excellent movie"></head><body><p>Recently, I rented the DVD of the Civil War epic Glory. I had seen the movie before and I loved it. This DVD only made me appreciate more and I'm glad I rented it.  <p>Matthew Broderick gives an excellent portrayal of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who is selected to lead the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first all black regiment of the Civil War. He not only has to fight for respect for his men, but also for his own respect. Cary Elwes is Shaw's brother, who is picked to help lead the 54th. Among the soldiers is Denzel Washington, in an Academy Award Winning Performance and Morgan Freeman. Washington, in the beginning of the movie, has no respect for the White man and hates him. But at the end, he gets rid of his hatred. That's what I think the film's final image represents: the unity of the black and white man as one. Shaw also gains the respect of his men when they charge Fort Wagner.  <p>The extras on the DVD are excellent. There is a commentary track from Director Edward Zwick that is excellent, though it may distract you from the movie. There are two featurettes: The original 1989 featurette that briefly covers the film's making and "Voices of Glory", which covers the story of the 54th from the actual letters from those who served. There is the original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for two other Denzel Washington movies (A Soldier's Story and Devil in a Blue Dress). There are also talent files and two deleted scenes. Though fascinating, after watching these scenes (With or without Zwick's commentary), it will be easy to see why they were deleted in the first place.  <p>The picture and sound quality is excellent. My only gripe is that in some scenes the sound is a bit low. Glory is one of those movies that uses both images and sound to its advantage. Nevertheless, the film is still just as powerful, especially during the final scenes at Fort Wagner. <p>So all things considered, this DVD transfer is excellent and would make a welcome addition to anyone's collection</p></body></html>

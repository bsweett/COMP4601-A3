<meta name="summary" content="A part 3 for my T3 review"></head><body><p>Read part 1 on the T3 DVD and part 2 of the review is on the Terminator 3 Swordfish double feature reviews. So yes I said I loved the ending and this film is bad but ain't that bad they had good action scences and a killer ending you got to see Judgement Day the  music playin is great  the songs called radio it's the only reason to get the sh***y soundtrack. While Nick Sthal blew chunks as John Connor his voiceover while Judgement Day is happening sends chills to your spine that's the only good thing about Sthal playing John Connor Schwarzenegger was the only good casting it's not Christina Lokken's fault that the T X was a mediocre villan it's the cliche script by JD Brancato & Micheal Ferris who I don't respect. They also wrote the script Terminator Salvation which comes  out next week I'm happy that we have no Nick Sthal as John Connor Christan Bale will be cool I like him alright he's a pretty good Batman. Linda Hamilton will narrate the movie no Claire Daniels. PG13 makes me a little nervous though</p></body></html>

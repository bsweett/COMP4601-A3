<meta name="summary" content=""Death As An Act Of Creation"~ Birth, Rebirth And The Tree Of Life On The Journey To Xibalba"></head><body><p>Where does one begin with a film such as the mind-boggling '06 film `The Fountain?' After viewing this extremely esoteric, non-linear journey through time and space one is left in a vague stupor, experiencing feelings of deep spirituality and unfathomable profundity all wrapped in a timeless universe of eternal beginnings and endings. Either that or one is bored out of their mind.<br /><br />Fortunately for me I fall into the first category. Director and writer Darren Aronofsky has graced us with a masterpiece work that will most likely never receive the acceptance and audience it surely desires, but it will have a following that will always adore this film.<br /><br />I guess it's time to sit down and re-vamp my personal list of all-time favorite films. I certainly have to find a spot for this one.</p></body></html>

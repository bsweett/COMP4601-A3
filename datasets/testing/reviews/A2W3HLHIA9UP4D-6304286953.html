<meta name="summary" content="3.5 Stars: A Well Done Werewolf Flick"></head><body><p>I had heard about this movie for years, but I had never watched it until recently. The main reason was that I don't really care for Werewolf movies that much. Theres so many of these films, its usually the same basic story every time, the effects usually aren't good, and to be honest, I just don't find the whole Werewolf concept that interesting or scary at all. But with this film, I had always read rave reviews about it, especially about the special effects in it, so since I found it cheap, I went ahead and purchased it. But there it laid on my shelf for many weeks before I did finally take the plunge and watch this classic werewolf tale. Again, I wasn't expecting to fall in love with this film, but I gotta say, I really did like it. And though the film does have comedy in it, its well balanced with scares as well. Usually comedy in horror films is something I don't want to see, but this film knew its limits, and I feel that it never went too far in doing that. Yeah, this is basically the same old werewolf tale, but modernized in a very good way. The story is of a American traveler David Kessler backpacking through various parts of Europe when him and his friend are attacked by a werewolf. His friend is killed, and David is bitten but saved. David soon discovers that he too, will become a werewolf during the next full moon, and that anyone who is close to him, is in danger. The special effects in the film are quite good for its time, and the transformation sequence of David first changing into the werewolf was undoubtedly the most impressive. But only did I like the special effects, I enjoyed the scenes with David and his "undead" friend Jack, who appears throughout the movie, each time looking more and more decomposed, who repeatedly warns David about becoming a werewolf and what he must do to stop it. Yes, I know, those are comedic sequences, but for some reason, I liked them. It was something different and fresh. After all, who many times do you see zombies/ghosts in the same movie with werewolves, and it actually work? In fact, a lot of people call this film a comedy horror, but I disagree. This is definitely a horror film just with some comedic elements added to the mix. This DVD has some pretty good special features including a commentary by cast members, a short little featurette, and an interview with director John Landis. In closing, I've seen my share of werewolf movies, most of them aren't that great in my opinion. Need I mention the horrible sequel "American Werewolf in Paris" or the crappy Wes Craven film, "Cursed"?? Indeed, this film has been the best werewolf movie I've seen so far. (I don't know if that saying a lot, though!) I think its done in a clever way, and it has a good balance to it. If you are a big fan of these movies, then I'm quite sure you've long since viewed and purchased this one. But if you're a newbie or just looking for a good werewolf tale, then look no further!</p></body></html>

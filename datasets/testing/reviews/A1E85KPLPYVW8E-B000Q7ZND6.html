<meta name="summary" content="Although it falls just a bit short, still worth seeing once"></head><body><p>***1/2<br />Constantine is a religious supernatural thriller that overall doesn't prove to be too bad of a flick, although it does fall short in a couple of areas in my opinion. I thought the movie had some good performances, an interestingly executed storyline, and some great fx.<br />The movie's first 20 or 30 minutes started out really great and promising, but to me really seemed like it lost its steam about halfway through. There was about a half hour in the middle that really bored the heck out me, and the end picked up somewhat, but didn't do as much for me as the first part of the film did. Leaving the theater I felt satisfied, but kind of unsatisifed at the same time. Make sense?<br />Other than that, Constantine has some strong performances, mainly from Keanu Reeves, a pretty decent plot, and at its best a great visual style accompanied by great special effects with demons, angels and visions of Hell included.<br />Other than falling short in a couple of areas, if you're a fan of Biblical supernatural thrillers about the cataclysm of Earth in the likes of films like Stigmata or End of Days, this is probably worth seeing at least once.</p></body></html>

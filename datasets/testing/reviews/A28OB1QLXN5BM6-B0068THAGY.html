<meta name="summary" content="Mediocre 8"></head><body><p>I really wanted to like SUPER 8, and there are certainly elements to like. But as I sat there with my extended family, including a 6, 7, 10, and 14-year-old, I kept wondering who the audience was. Clearly, it was intended for children, since the mother dies immediately in a horrible crushing accent. (Dead parents are the hallmark of all great kid movies, donchaknow?) And then the jokes about what was in the mother's coffin (seriously), because she was brutally crushed, so there couldn't be a body...well those scenes had my kids in stitches. Then there was the movie-long father-son angst about the mother's brutal death - riveting to say the least - and the pot-smoking hippie who drove the kids around declaring how stoned he was. Plus the language the kids spewed. And the military murdering a teacher and...and...and...<br /><br />What's good about SUPER 8? The child-actors were fine. They were 100% clich&eacute;, but that doesn't bother me. The movie that they make is funny but lasts, literally, as long as it take the credits to roll. There's a clich&eacute;d but sweet coming of age/first romance story that is respectable. The alien angle was too scary for the younger kids in my group, but the concept of the protagonists catching something important on their little camera is compelling. I really do wish it had been more like the Goonies or Stand By Me, to which SUPER 8 has been widely compared.<br /><br />When I see Steven Spielberg's name on the marquee of a science fiction movie, I'm really torn. My impulse is to run, but I remember Minority Report and think, maybe... But I also still remember A.I., and my feet start me moving toward the door. For SUPER 8, I saw J.J. Abram's name, too, and I was hopeful. Alas, it was not to be. I have to think there were some mighty internal fights over the direction this movie should take. And in the end, I think the audience was the loser. I would have loved to see more of the small-town charm, more of the kids (quieter and with more believable dialog) and less of the angst and brutal mother-crushing.</p></body></html>

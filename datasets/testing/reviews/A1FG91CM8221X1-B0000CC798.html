This is true both for Bryan Singer's "X-Men" movies and Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" series. In both series of movies, the special effects are absolutely state-of-the-art, and the action sequences are a total wow. But they are also well-written and impeccably cast, with characters an audience can actually care about. "X2: X-Men United" has the same advantage as "Spider-Man 2"--since most of the main characters were already introduced in the first film, the sequel can get down to the business of creating an engrossing story for them. In the case of "X2," the story hinges on a dastardly plot to frame the mutants for an assassination attempt on the President, leading to a worldwide hue-and-cry against them. All the old characters are back, and there are some intriguing new ones--Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), the ostensible assassin, and the hissable Stryker (Brian Cox), who seeks revenge on the mutants. In any case, Bryan Singer takes as much care with the performances and the characters--their interrelations and motivations--as he does with the makeup and the action sequences, and it pays off big. All the performers are very good, but the three top-lined ones--Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and Hugh Jackman--stand out. It's wonderful to see such consummate classical actors as Stewart and McKellen play antagonists, particularly such semi-friendly ones as Xavier and Magneto. As Wolverine, Jackman--a sort of Mad Max/Snake Plissken type among the mutants--is riveting. If you compare what he does here with what he does as Curly in "Oklahoma!", you can only conclude that here is a superstar in the making.</p></body></html>

He retreats to his secluded country home to work on a new book. One day, he is jolted from sleep by a stranger at his door. This man, named John Shooter (John Turturro), claims that Mort has plagiarized a short story that he wrote. Mort denies the accusation, claiming that he wrote the story first and can prove it. But John Shooter is determined to exact revenge.<br /><br />"Secret Window" is based on Stephen King's story "Secret Window, Secret Garden", published in his 1990 collection "Four Past Midnight". The story was adapted for the screen and directed by David Koepp. Koepp does an admirable job of manipulating the audience, creating suspense, and surprising us. Johnny Depp is perfect in the role of this slightly eccentric, suddenly spooked writer. John Turturro gives the most memorable performance of the film as the monotone, obsessed, menacing villain. I wouldn't have pictured Turturro in the role of a country bumpkin. It just goes to show the breadth of his talent. I thoroughly enjoyed "Secret Window". It looks good. The story is solid and layered. Director David Koepp is creative, clever, and has a great sense of timing.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include four deleted scenes, three featurettes, "Animatics", and an audio commentary from director David Koepp. "From Book to Film" is a documentary featuring interviews with David Koepp and the film's cast. The first 10 minutes of it basically just recap the film. Then there is some discussion of casting and filming. I wouldn't bother with this one. "A Look Through It" is a better documentary. 30 minutes long, David Koepp talks about the decisions he made shooting key sequences in the film, such as the opening hotel sequence and shooting inside the cabin. "Secrets Revealed" is a 13-minute documentary discussing the final 15 minutes of the movie. If you're really interested, these last two documentaries are the ones to watch. "Animatics" shows what are essentially animated storyboards for four scenes in the film. There is no narration or explanation. I had already heard too much commentary from the director to want to listen to the film's audio commentary, so I can't comment on that except to say that director David Koepp is interesting and well-spoken, so you might want to give the commentary a try if an hour's worth of featurettes haven't satisfied you. Subtitles are available in English and French. Dubbing is available in French.</p></body></html>

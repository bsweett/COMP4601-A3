<meta name="summary" content="Can it be real?"></head><body><p>This is a well-crafted, well-acted subtle little movie which makes some very interesting observations on society, contains an intriguing mystery and features a wonderful performance from one of my favorite actors, Paul Giamatti.<br /><br />Set in Vienna (but actually filmed in and around Prague) in 1900, the movie is about a couple of childhood friends from very different social classes- the son of a cabinet-maker and Sophie, a royal princess. Their friendship is forcibly ended by the princess's family, but 15 years later the boy, now a man, reappears as an illusionist. They meet again and realize that they are in love; but how to separate themselves from the inevitable backlash against such a misalliance?<br /><br />The movie is told from the perspective of Inspector Uhl (Giamatti), a policeman responsible for security in the royal household. He reports to Crown Prince Leopold (the splendidly menacing Rufus Sewell), heir to the throne and a jealous and violent man, who wishes to marry Princess Sophie (Jessica Biel). When Eisenheim the illusionist (Edward Norton) delivers a number of barely veiled insults to the Crown Prince, Uhl is ordered to get rid of him. There follows a battle of wits between Uhl and Eisenheim, in which Uhl holds all the cards but Eisenheim tries to manipulate how they are played.<br /><br />The movie succeeds on many levels. It's atmospheric and gives the feel of a period piece; it points out the class distinctions of the time when it was literally possible for the Crown Prince to get away with murder; it takes a subtle dig at those who are obsessed by the supernatural and believe they are seeing something paranormal even when assured it is an illusion; the illusions are realistic and actually could have been performed at the time; and it uses misdirection as cleverly as Eisenheim himself. Interestingly, some of the interior scenes were filmed at the home of Arch-Duke Ferdinand of Sarajevo, whose assassination was the flashpoint for the start of World War One.<br /><br />The mistake the movie could have made, but happily didn't, is to make Uhl an unworthy opponent for Eisenheim. Instead, the two men respect each other and Eisenheim knows that nothing less than his best will fool the inspector. Moreover, Uhl is not an unlikeable man and throughout the film he faces an internal battle between his responsibilities and his personal inclinations. The final scene, in which Inspector Uhl mentally reviews all the facts and clues, is a brilliant piece of acting by Giamatti and leaves us thoroughly uplifted.<br /><br />Although a number of reviews compare this movie to 'The Prestige', which came out at about the same time, the movies are quite unlike each other except superficially- they both involve stage illusionists and are set at the end of the 19th century. This is the smaller, more intimate film, but just as effective in its own way. Enjoy them both.</p></body></html>

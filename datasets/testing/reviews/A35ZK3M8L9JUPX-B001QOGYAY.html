<meta name="summary" content="The Lovely Bones"></head><body><p>"The Lovely Bones" is the story of a 14-year-old girl from suburban Pennsylvania who is murdered by her neighbor. She tells the story from Heaven, showing the lives of the people around her and how they have changed all while attempting to get someone to find her lost body.  I have never read the book but the movie is great. It is very interesting. The visual effects are great and the score is perfect. In my opinion, the movie is creative and entertaining. I'm sure the book is more elaborate so I might have to read it. A must see movie.</p></body></html>

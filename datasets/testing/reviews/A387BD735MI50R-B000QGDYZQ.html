<meta name="summary" content="A Frantic Race through "Our Town""></head><body><p>"Premonition" in some ways struck me as a more modern, more action-packed version of Thornton Wilder's perennial school drama class favorite "Our Town." In Wilder's classic, life is recapitulated and lived out of order as the result of a feverish dream.<br /><br />In this drama, there is greater mystery and urgency attached to the protagonist's disordered experience of her life. We don't learn what causes the shuffling of days here.  Sandra Bullock's life inexplicably jumps ahead to a day when she is informed of her husband's death in a fiery car crash. When she is backtracked, she must race to see if she can avert the disaster.<br /><br />Whether she can or not though, she is given a different perspective on her life. She is jerked out of the train of petty household grievance and is allowed to see the bigger picture of her relationship with her husband and family. Through the jolts of these changing gears, she's awakened, sometimes to a greater appreciation of the good, sometimes to a greater understanding of the bad, in her daily interactions. While we are usually told that the secret to living a happy life is to live fully in the "now," this movie might incidentally make a case for being able to live our days as a spill of Scrabble on the table - where we have to search out the possible anagrams ourselves. Through the effort required in that back and forth and lack of linearity, there might actually emerge a greater clarity about what's truly of value in our lives.<br /><br />This movie is not a sermon on how to live happily though. While I wouldn't quite classify it the way its DVD jacket does, as a "thriller," its emphasis is definitely on the frantic suspense of - Can she or can't she? - of "Run, Lola, Run!"</p></body></html>

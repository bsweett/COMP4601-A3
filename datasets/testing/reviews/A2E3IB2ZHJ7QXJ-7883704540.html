Allow me to go into reviewing this fine movie without having to resort to a cheesy intro filled with terrible puns related to food (nice cliched intro, eh?).<br /><br />Ratatouille's message is pretty simple, but like other Pixar works, they never turn into a preach-fest (which is something all movies should never do), serving up a mix of humor, some action, and people actually doing interesting things instead of just sitting around and talking.  Few things are more entertaining in the Pixar canon than watching a rat (which is somehow cute, but that's because animals are naturally cuter than humans because they are the ______) cook gourmet soup.  However,<br />Pixar is not often known for elaborate witty humor, as some of the slapstick in this movie is not my type of humor (yeah, my humor includes movies like Pulp Fiction and Dead Alive).  Thankfully, there is not a lot of childish slapstick, and even some of the slapstick scenes are kind of funny. And there is some sharp dialogue thrown in there ("Now shut up and eat your garbage".  "Don't be so modest your a rat for pete's sake" etc)I do however, think the Collete and Linguini relationship was just thrown in there to make the movie seem more intimate, but that is pretty much kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Of course, Pixar also is able to create a cast of characters that makes the entertaining parts actually entertaining, and characters you actually give a damn about.  The rat colony and family, the short, leering antagonist, and a colorful set of kitchen cooks (with one that has done time, no less)  And of course, an animated rat is proved to be likeable.  My favorite character is Anton Ego, the powerful food critic (actually pretty dead on description of critics) whom everyone fears, a leering intimidating man, but ultimately a bit good natured and actually humane (and no, he is NOT evil.  Watch the flashback you idiots).<br /><br />As usual, the animation is top notch.  Thanks to the flawless animation and an imagination, Pixar was able to recreate a fantasty version of Paris, somewhat romanticized, but brilliant nonetheless.  Remy's overhead look of Paris is dazzling, as well as the lush, homey country at the beggining of the movie.  Furthermore, it's got enough variety into the imagined version of Paris that's it's extremely believable and not just some choked up romantic version of Paris that exists in everyone dreams (which is somewhat true, but Paris obviously has plenty of bad areas with an abscence of lights).  There's plenty of grit and grime of a real city, which is pleasing to know so, and feels very Paris in the grit and grime way.  Also worth noting is the challenged they overcame by making the actual computer generated food look somewhat delicious, and it kind of does.  Everything else is wonderfully detailed as usual, from the water, rain, to the fantastically designed interiors (!).<br /><br />Voice casting?  Ratatouille doesn't have as many big names as Cars did (the number of special people on that movie were insane!), but I'm not quite sure if Peter O' Toole's voice isn't smaller than any of them.  Come on, this was the guy that was in Lawrence of Arabia and Caligula (Yeah, why the ________ am I namedropping a pornographic movie in a review for a family film) But O' Toole or not, the other cast memembers are no slouches either.  Other big names in the adult movie world include Ian Holm, who was in Alien and Brazil, as well as Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Is Ratatouille the best Pixar movie?  No, but it's definitely up there.  And to think that a movie studio that made such a milestone like Toy Story is still releasing movies that are still pushing the envelope in what they are doing with computer animation and storytelling (maybe not storytelling since not every plot they do is that interesting to me, such as WALL-E).<br /><br />Oh, and one other thing.  Isn't the comparison to food and music absolutely dead on?  Whoa!<br /><br />B+</p></body></html>

And the director achieves an eeriness, a tension in little things.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional throughout. All the main characters are played with true intelligence behind their eyes. You can tell there is really someone home there. (In the case of Emily Rose, there may be more than one intelligence behind her eyes.)<br /><br />Campbell Scott, playing the prosecuting attorney, was a special surprise. I had been vaguely aware of him as a character actor in other films, but he comes into his own here. The DVD commentary identifies him as the son of actor George C. Scott. He performs his courtroom scenes with the same intensity his father was known for, but without any over-the-top tone of antagonsim.<br /><br />However, I have several problems with the movie. I would have liked the DVD commentary to elaborate on just how much it is based on real events. But the commentary is silent and disappointing on this point - and so leads me to believe that any connection to a real person or real events must be tenuous at best.<br /><br />But more crucially, I had a problem with the courtroom scenes. The battle lines seem to be falsely drawn. On the one side is the defendent, a priest being prosecuted for treating Emily Rose's condition with an exorcism rather than by referring her for further psychological help. On the other side is a loose consortium of psychologists who contend that is was criminal not to have continued treating Emily Rose for - perhaps schizophrenia, perhaps some manic-depressive disorder.<br /><br />I don't believe this is even remotely the way any actual court case would have aligned. First of all, it seems much likelier that if any criminal charges were brought in such a case, they would have been brought against Emily Rose's parents for failure to get her continued, modern medical care. It would have been a charge similar to one that has been brought against Christian Scientist parents who have insisted that their children be treated only with prayer in instances where those children had some specific, operable medical conditions. That is what should have been at issue here. Did Emily Rose's parents have a right to maintain a strictly religious interpretation of Emily's symptoms? Does the State have a right to compel parents to submit their children to modern medical practice?<br /><br />But even given the movie's premise that is was the priest who would be prosecuted - the only medical people arrayed against him were psychologists/psychoanalysts presenting the vague alternative that Emily had a mental problem. In the DVD commentary, the director does state that he was striving for an unspecified time frame for this movie. He wanted it to look as if it could have taken place anywhere from the 1970's to the present. Certainly though, the action takes place in recent decades. And some more strict medical explanations of Emily's condition would have been available.<br /><br />Oliver Sach's 'Awakenings' discovery would have been known. So the possibility that Emily had contracted some encephalitis sort of illness that led to catatonia, convulsions, and hallucinations could have been entertained. Or, enough might have been known about the genetic nature of Huntington's Disease to suggest that as a possibility for her illness. In Huntington's Disease, the severity of the illness and its time of onset depends upon how many repetitions of a certain sequence of nucleic bases exist in a gene on the victim's Chromosome 4. The more repetitions, the earlier and harder a person is hit with rigidity and hallucinations.<br /><br />I don't say that either an encephalitis germ or a Huntington's gene would have been the answer to Emily's condition. I'm only saying that some such concrete medical explanation for such symptoms would have been advanced in recent decades. The possible explanations for such suffering would not have been limited to vague psychological diagnoses - 'maybe some sort of schizophrenia, maybe some sore of, ah, manic depression.'<br /><br />So by failing to represent the real issues any court action brought in such a case would have revolved around - the whole movie loses credibility. I realize it would have been harder to maintain dramatic tension with the introduction of germ and DNA testimony. However I think it needed to be done. As things stand, this movie gives the Devil more than his due - and diminishes the possibility of Him in the process.</p></body></html>

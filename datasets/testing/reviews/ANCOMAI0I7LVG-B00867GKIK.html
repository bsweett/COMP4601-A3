Of their releases there is only one that I cannot stand (`Cars') but there are quite a few I consider absolutely wonderful (`Ratatouille', `The Incredibles') and one that I consider a near masterpiece (`Finding Nemo').  In my personal opinion, `Up' is the best thing they have ever done.  It is, quite frankly, a modern masterpiece in animated filmmaking.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple on the outset.  Carl Fredricksen (who looks an awful lot like Spencer Tracy) is a crotchety old widower who is holding onto the only memory he has of his departed wife; their home and a dream of adventure.  When circumstances shift, paving the way for Carl to be court ordered to a nursing home, he decides to try his hand at adventure by tying thousands of balloons to his roof and going up, up, up and away.  With a young stowaway named Russell, an overweight boy-scout of sorts, Carl sets off in hot pursuit of Paradise Falls, the land he and his beloved wife always dreamed of exploring.<br /><br />Let's get one thing straight; this is a story about a floating house, so don't expect it to be realistic.  To those who pick apart plot holes such as "where was Russell's mother this whole time" and the like, sure it isn't realistic, but are you really expecting it to be?<br /><br />One thing I will agree on is that this is a very sad and dramatic film that may not be suitable for all children.  I do feel that it may be good for children who face similar situations as Russell to see their home life displayed in a sweetly appealing setting like the one presented in this animated film, but I do also feel that some subjects discussed may be too deep or even unsettling at times for young ones.  It was choking me up.  Within the first ten minutes we are introduced to themes such as the inability to have children (or it possibly could have been a miscarriage) and the death of a spouse.  Themes such as single parent families and neglect come into play as well, and the ending, which is sweet, is also laced with sadness.<br /><br />The film will make you smile and laugh, but it will make you cry A LOT.<br /><br />With that solitary caution (it does tend to get very violent towards the end as well, and with attacks made on a child I find that it may be a concern to a parent) I have to say that this is a very, very, very good movie; great even.  No, better than great; it is a MASTERPIECE.  The animation is stellar, the concept is original and engaging, the humor is strong and the gags are all on point, fresh and welcome.  For me, it was nice to see such strong emotional themes explored in this context.  It adds a different layer to the general consensus of dramatic entertainment.  Sure, this is no where near as gritty or as overwhelming as `Grave of the Fireflies', but `Up' allows the humor to play a perfect balance to the mature point of view this film is taking.<br /><br />There are very few animated films that can handle both sides of the spectrum with such grace and eloquence.</p></body></html>

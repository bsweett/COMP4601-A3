<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton and the Chocolate Factory"></head><body><p>Last weekend I went out and saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I've not read the book, nor seen the original, so I had no expectations for the story.<br /><br />This was typical Tim Burton fare: well-directed, with impressive visuals and a great cast. Burton always manages to assemble a great cast, and bring the best out of them. Not that Johnny Depp needs any real coaching to do a good job, mind you. The kid actors are splendid, which was good to see; if they hadn't been capable of doing a good job, this movie would have been toast.<br /><br />As for the storyline...it's a little oddball, and Willy Wonka clearly is calculating and non-personable (though I'mnot sure kids would see it this way)....all the kids who suffer horrible fates are clearly suffering pre-planned fates. Willy Wonka is clearly a character which needs redemption, and he does get it by movie's end, but the achievement of that goal seems a little weakly executed. This is a weak point on my part though, and shouldn't stop folks from enjoying the movie.<br /><br />This is not Tim Burton's best work, but it's still good, and definitely something to take the kids out to see!</p></body></html>

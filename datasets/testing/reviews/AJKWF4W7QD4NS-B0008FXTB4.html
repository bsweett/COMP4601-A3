<meta name="summary" content="Worth seeing for fans of Get Shorty, but don't expect much from it"></head><body><p>This sequel to the 1995 adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Get Shorty finds F. Gary Gray in the director's chair this time around, as Be Cool finds former loan shark turned movie mogul Chili Palmer (John Travolta) looking to leave Hollywood and try his luck in the music industry.  Upon the death of a colleague (James Woods), Chili teams up with the widow (Uma Thurman) to sign a young up and coming songstress (Christina Milian) to their fledgling record label, which owes quite a bit of cash to an Ivy League gangster-rap executive (Cedric the Entertainer).  In the mix of all this is Milian's wanna be black former manager (Vince Vaughn, perfectly cast), his gay bodyguard (The Rock), and Vaughn's sleazy boss (Harvey Keitel); all of whom are soon gunning for Chili.  While Be Cool doesn't aspire to the greatness of Get Shorty (far from it), it's slickly produced Hollwyood entertainment that, for the most part, serves it's purpose.  Travolta is as great as ever, Thurman is wasted, and Vaughn and the Rock are undoubtadly the best things about Be Cool.  Danny DeVito, the only other returning cast member from Get Shorty, offers nothing more than an extended cameo, which is supremely disappointing.  That aside, Be Cool is a worthy mainstream distraction, just don't go into it expecting something special like Get Shorty.</p></body></html>

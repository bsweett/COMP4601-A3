<meta name="summary" content="I roll with the crowd on this one."></head><body><p>In such a terrible year of movies, it's no wonder an independent film got all the rave. Why not, big business has caused films to lose all the elements that make the movie going public want to sit in a theater. No one knows how to tell a good story, put the right actors in the right role, and even know how to tug at the human emotions. Slumdog Millionaire on the other hand, did know what to do.<br /><br />This film is the story of a boy named Jamal who came out of the slums of Mumbai India, to end up on the Indian version of the hit game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...and he wins! Because of that he is thrust into the worst few hours of his life because he was accused of cheating. You'd like to think his spirit is being crushed, then the story begins, the story of how he knew each and every answer. Then as the story unfolds you are brought into a grand story of family, survival, betrayal and true love. The real heavy hitter is when the police find out exactly why Jamal got on that show and it really makes you wonder about your own life and what truly are treasures in our lives.<br /><br />I was blown away by this movie for many different reasons. The acting, the story, the music...you name it was a cut above everything I had seen all year. This movie could not have been released in a better time. A time when we in America think we have it bad during a time of misfortune. It teaches us to really look deep inside and find what matters to us and not take things for granted. This movie should also teach the big movie companies a thing or two. I think it is time to stop figuring out how much money a movie can make and just put a great story on the screen. A good story is what will bring the crowds. I mean no offense to Heath Ledger, but when a role in a summer blockbuster based on a comic book is given an Oscar. It just shows you how the so called Oscar worthy movies has gone downhill.<br /><br />*To redeem myself I thought that Heath Ledger was great in The Dark Knight and truly deserved it! It just shows you that there was not a single better performance in 2008 for a supporting role.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Comedy of Err-ers"></head><body><p>This is truly a movie I should not like. It's profane, gory and violent. So why do I watch it again and again?<br /><br />Quentin Tarentino has assembled the coolest cast (Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel Jackson and more) in the weirdest and least likely comic vehicle ever produced. The film follows a cast of hoodlums, hit men and drug queens as they interact in the mean streets of Los Angeles. The film plays with time, jumbling time sequences so that "dead" characters come back to life. Hilarity ensues from the bumbling actions of Scripture-spouting hit men, heroin-addled heroines and various pimped-up freaks and tough guys. There is genuine camaraderie, honor and restraint between the most death-dealing of characters, which makes them sympathetic and gives the film its bizarre charm.<br /><br />Comedy aside, this movie is not for the faint of heart. There's plenty of gore, lots of gunplay, profanity by the bucketful and heart-stopping drug scenes.</p></body></html>

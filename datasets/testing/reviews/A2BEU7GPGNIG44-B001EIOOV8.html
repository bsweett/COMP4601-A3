<meta name="summary" content="Great DVD for people who want to purchase the movie"></head><body><p>Believe it or not it has been 10 years since the classic movie Casino was released. Sharon Stone made her splash in the early 90's with Basic Instinct. After the success of Sliver was questionable and with no Basic Instinct sequel in the works, many at the time looked at Casino as her career deal maker. Stone didn't disappoint. She shined in her roll as Ginger, a call girl whose character would eventually marry Robert Deniro's character. Although the movie had an all star cast, Stone was the only actor in the film to nab an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />When the film was initially released, it was scrutinized and compared to the movie Goodfella's. Joe Pesci and Deniro both appeared in this Scorcese film. The movie itself is rather long but it's a wonderful movie and I love it. The writing is great, the scenery is great, it's a good movie.<br /><br />Overtime it has not been as revered as Goodfellas, but it is still a well loved movie. For this reason Universal has released Casino-10th Anniversary Edition. A part of me wants to say that this was only released again to remind people that the movie is out on DVD.<br /><br />Okay, on to the review of this new release. It's a single disc in a standard DVD case. The film has been digitally remastered. The extra's are solely for the person really interested in the movie or the behind the scenes aspect of the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great DVD for people who want to purchase the movie and didn't buy the last DVD or for fans of the film who bought the movie the last time but were not pleased that the previous DVD didn't have any extras.</p></body></html>

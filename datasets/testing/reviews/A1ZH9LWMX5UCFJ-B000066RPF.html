The knights of the round table are all delightfully dimwitted on their quest and it is a perfect mix of song, hilarious one-liners, and physical gags: "Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!"; the Black Knight ('tis but a scratch); the Killer Rabbit; the Holy Hand Grenade; "cut down a tree with...a herring!". It is hard to believe it was made for just peanuts and only in 5 weeks, this comedy has stood the test of time.</p></body></html>

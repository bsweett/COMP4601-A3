I can forgo any complaints about the casting of the main character. The story is the culprit here. This is actually a very engrossing film until the final third. The film titillates the viewer tediously divulging events and characters constructing a complex framework of suspense, paranoia and intrigue that ultimately delivers a devastating situation to the world's two superpowers. It is amazing that the scriptwriter, the director or both did not know how to culminate all these events into a climax equal to the impressive filmmaking up to that point. Throughout this film the villains seemed to hold great power and influence and were in absolute control of events that they were manipulating. In the final third of the film the rug gets pulled out from under them and the rest of us. Even Jerry Goldsmith's score seemed to be somewhat reflective on the dubiousness of this entire project. To summarize I can only state that if you have seen the trailer, than you have seen the basic plot line and there is really nothing more you need to see.</p></body></html>

What's frustrating about Jeepers is how decent of a movie it could have been had it been handled by a director with far more skill than Victor Salva.<br /><br />I like Justin Long, I think he's one of a handful of Gen Y actors who has genuine talent. I thought he did an admirable job of conveying real fear in this movie. I think he's only continued to grow as an actor and I really enjoyed him most recently in Drag Me To Hell, a film which I absolutely loved. He has a likeable quality about him in anything I've seen him in. No problem with Gina Philips either, she's easy on the eyes and did a great job playing the "smart" sister. It wasn't the acting that doomed this movie for me, it was rather the absolutely assine character decisions and huge plot holes that doomed it for me. You ask for examples, here goes in no particular order:<br /><br />1. When Darry gets hauled off by the Creeper at the end, why didn't the sister have the entire police force follow her back to the old church, since she knew damn well that's where he was heading?<br /><br />2. Why did Darry (Justin's character) go into the well? I know in the movie he talks about all of a sudden his conscience getting the better of him, but there is NO ONE in their right mind who would have done that over calling 911 to send police to handle the situation themselves.<br /><br />3. Why did the brother and sister get back in their car and leave the safety of the restaurant? Or at the least, why didn't they drive with the police if they knew the Creeper had just been in their car and was seriously after them at that point?<br /><br />4. What was wrong with the patrons of the restaurant, not a one of them showed an ounce of emotion to the plight of these kids. That was probably more action than they had seen in decades and they all acted as though they were comatose.<br /><br />5. Could the old psychic have been any more cliche and unbelievable?<br /><br />6. Who is the Creeper and where did he come from? Supposedly in the third film the Creeper's origin will be revealed, but guess what, that's then, and this is now, and having a creature with absolutely no back story is the laziest kind of film making. They pulled the same stunt with Cloverfield, a movie which was even worse than this one.<br /><br />7. How is it that only one, little old crazy psychic lady knows about this thing, when supposedly every 23 years it comes out to feed for 23 days straight? You mean to tell me, NO ONE would have found out about this Creeper thing or its lair in all the time it's been kidnapping and killing townsfolk? At the very least, if the psychic was having these visions and knew the Creeper was taking people to the old church to torture and eat them, don't you think it would have been decent of her to alert authorities about it?<br /><br />I could go on, but it's a 10 year old movie and I don't want to spend any more time on it. Plot holes and stupid character decisions withstanding, the biggest sin this movie made was, it wasn't very scary. The scene where Darry enters the well and discovers the old church basement mutilations and instruments of torture was about the only time I felt a slight increase in my pulse. I also jumped immediately after from the cheap scare tactic anyone who's seen the movie knows what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I skipped the 2nd, but am midly interested in the 3rd due to the revelation made by Victor Salva that the origin of the Creeper will finally be relevealed, and that he aims to make it "very scary." I'll believe it when I see it, and since its due date is sometime in 2013 I won't hold my breath.</p></body></html>

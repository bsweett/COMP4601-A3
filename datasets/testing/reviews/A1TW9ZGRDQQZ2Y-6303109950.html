<meta name="summary" content="In My Top 5 Favorite Westerns for Sure"></head><body><p>Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are the driving force that makes this film work. Sure it isn't totally realistic, but it is more fun than any other western I have seen. The gunfight at the OK Corral in the film is probably the best you will ever see at showing what most likely really happened on October 26, 1881. Val Kilmer steals every scene he is in and spews forth some of the coolest lines you will ever here coming out of a western movie. Kilmer's Doc Holliday is one of the only roles I can stand him in and he is an absolute genius at this part. I'm not a huge fan of Kurt Russell either, but he is my favorite Wyatt Earp by far. This is a must have western that is more fun than Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp, but I would see that one too for a more accurate depiction of Earp's life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A haunting look at the struggle for survival in the Jewish Ghetto"></head><body><p>Roman Polanski's "The Pianist" tracks the incredible struggle for survival of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist in 1930s Warsaw. As the film opens, Wladyslaw is recording on Polish radio, but a bombing raid forces him out of the studio and into the panicked streets. We soon meet his family: a headstrong brother, gentle sisters, and aged parents who are aghast at the more and more extreme measures taken to dehumanize Polish Jews: wearing armbands, not allowed to walk on sidewalks, not allowed to sit on benches in public parks or eat in Gentile establishments, and finally, the move to the Ghetto. Wladyslaw's tight-knit family struggles to stay together as conditions become more and more dire.<br /><br />The film traces the disintegration of order in Warsaw from 1939 to 1945. Wladyslaw's life goes to new lows as the Ghetto is evacuated to the work (death) camps, and he must go into hiding, his situation becoming more and more dire as he is forced to flee from place to place and scrabble for food. He is taken advantage of, nearly dies from jaundice, and is nearly killed several times, but throughout the music in his head, heart and fingertips still burns brightly. Towards the end of the war, a single act of kindness by a Nazi commander proves that there is still decency in humanity, and finally Wladyslaw is once more able to give the world his musical gift over Polish radio.<br /><br />This film, while perhaps not on the same level as Schindler's list (there is very little dialogue for much of the film, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it becomes an almost Cast Away tale of solitary survival at its rawest), highlights the indignities perpetrated against European Jews. Dead bodies litter the streets, and the Nazis indiscriminately kill or humiliate whoever they so desire. Human dignity has no worth. The film's violence serves to underscore how much like animals humans can become, filled with primitive blood lust, or like the Jews in the Ghetto, forced to survive on an animal level: an old man attacks an old woman to steal her food, and as the mush splashes on the filthy pavement, he hungrily stuffs it into his mouth off the ground. This is powerful filmmaking, based in part on some of Polanski's own remembrances. (Rated R for graphic violence).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""So what, is he going to get crushed by a giant SpongeBob?""></head><body><p>Interesting characters, an engaging story, and bizarre, intricately orchestrated death scenes...these were the three main elements I took away from the original Final Destination (2000)...after watching Final Destination 3 (2006) last night, it seems only one of the three elements I mentioned made it to the third installment (I'll give you a hint...it wasn't the interesting characters or engaging story).  Co-written and directed by James Wong ("The X Files", Final Destination, The One), the film stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Ring Two, Sky High) and Ryan Merriman (Halloween: Resurrection, The Ring Two).  Also appearing is Amanda Crew (She's the Man), who looks a heck of a lot like the singer Tiffany, Kris Lemche (Ginger Snaps), Sam Easton (Underclassman), Alexz Johnson ("Instant Star"), Jesse Moss ("Whistler"), Gina Holden (The Butterfly Effect 2), Chelan Simmons (Dr. Dolittle 3), Crystal Lowe (Scary Movie 4), and Texas Battle (Coach Carter), which is about one of the goofiest names I've heard in awhile, but whatever...<br /><br />As the film begins we see a group of seniors from McKinley High at an amusement park and we end up focusing on two couples, Wendy `Wen' Christensen (Winstead), Jason `J' Wise (Moss), Kevin Fischer (Merriman), and Carrie Dreyer (Holden).  Eventually the foursome head towards the mammoth roller coaster called Satan's Armpit (or something like that), but Wendy, who's on the yearbook committee and has been snapping pictures all night long (this is a key aspect later on) gets a bad feeling...if you've seen the previous two films then you'll probably guess she's got `the sight', in that she gets an ookie feeling when bad things are about to happen.  Anyway, if you've seen the first film, picture in place of a plane a roller coaster, as disaster strikes taking a handful of teens (Wendy had a serious freak out while sitting in the coaster, eventually leading to a number of teens not taking the ride of death).  Okay, so if I've learned anything from the previous two films it's that you cannot cheat death, and sure enough those who got off the coaster begin getting picked off in particularly horrible ways...emollition, decapitation, electrocution, impalement, and so on...and guess what?  Not only does Wendy have an idea of who's next to go, but she also has clues to how they're going to die, said clues found in the very photos she took the night of the disaster.  All she has to do now is convince those who are next on death's hit list before they bite it, which is kind of difficult given few, if any, truly believe her, at least until it's too late...<br /><br />I signed on for this ride with my main expectation being to see a lot of really nasty, violent death sequences, as found in the previous films, and I wasn't disappointed in that aspect.  The biggest problems I had with the film was both the actual story and characters seemed flat and relatively uninteresting.  The most interesting character for me also happened to be the sleaziest, one named Frankie Cheeks (Easton), the socially retarded creepy guy who graduated a couple of years earlier but still hangs out at high school functions hoping to score with some underage babes who might be dense enough to fall for his game (every class had someone like this).  As far as the rest of the characters, I honestly didn't care for any of them one way or another, and saw them as nothing but fodder for the meat grinder...there really wasn't any performances that stuck out, but there are some pretty comical lines thrown about, one in particular that featured Wendy and Kevin.  Kevin didn't want to see his actual `death picture', but he did ask Wendy for some sort of confirmation that it didn't involve him going out in an embarrassing way, with something getting rammed up his rear portal.  If I had to pick the most painful death sequence from the film I think I'd have to go with the one connected to the sun tanning beds, only because it was the most drawn out, the with nail gun incident at the hardware store a close second.  As far as the rest, I won't go into detail, but they are gruesome and visceral, and usually occur as the result of a lengthy build up.  Perhaps this is where the most fun is, as while you're watching events unfold, you're trying to figure out where it's all leading to in terms of how the person involved is going to get it...I learned a number of things from this film, including the following...<br /><br />1. When the roller coaster you're riding on starts emitting showers of sparks, that's a sure sign something is wrong.<br /><br />2. Wheels are an essential part to a roller coaster operating properly.<br /><br />3. Roller coasters apparently don't have any sensors to detect the loss of hydraulics, causing the ride to shut down automatically as a safety feature.<br /><br />4. The Grim Reaper seems partial to deaths caused by massive head injuries, particularly in those whom escaped his grasp through the intervention of another.<br /><br />5. High school girls sure like to show their mid-drifts.<br /><br />6. Those bubble headed bimbos sure were dumb, but they had some nice mams.<br /><br />7. Never frequent a tanning salon operated by a Russian guy as if something goes wrong, he won't be around, having accidentally locked himself of the building by gabbing with his girlfriend on his cell phone.<br /><br />8. Loose shelving, Big Gulps, and tanning beds don't mix.<br /><br />9. Nail guns are effective against pigeons (and people).<br /><br />10. The Grim Reaper is vindictive as hell, especially towards those whom escaped his grasp through the intervention of another, so much so he creates exceptionally elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque scenarios that result in hideous deaths.<br /><br />11. Lockers rooms are very dangerous places, especially those occupied by jocks soaked with testosterone (and most likely steroids).<br /><br />12. Goth couples have cutesy nicknames for each other, like Zip and Pip (blech).<br /><br />13. Anytime the wind blows, the lights dim, and the radio in your car goes nutty, that's a sure sign someone is going to die horribly.<br /><br />14. Good luck charms ain't worth diddly spit when death comes a callin'.<br /><br />15. You can't cheat death, but you can really tick him off.<br /><br />As I said, there isn't much in the way of story or characters, but if you dig on bizarre, visceral death sequences, then you enjoy this film.  Also, Wong does keep things moving along well as the hour and a half run time went by very quickly.  All in all a whole lot of flash (and blood), but not much substance...was I expecting more?  Not really, but it would have been nice, especially with Wong, who was behind the original Final Destination, at the helm.<br /><br />I won't bother mentioning all the extras included on this two disc DVD release as the Amazon site does that well enough, but I will say the picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, and the audio, available in Dolby Digital 5.1 EX Surround, DTS-ES 6.1 Discrete, and Dolby Digital Surround, both come across immaculately.  Also, there's two versions of the film here...one being the standard, theatrical release, and a second that allows for some interaction in that at certain points in the film in that the viewer gets to make choices for the actors (resulting in them doing one of two actions), thereby altering the story slightly (maybe they die, maybe they don't...maybe they die a different way then originally depicted).<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I won't ever......."></head><body><p>.......pre-judge a film ever again without seeing it first.  I had been talking trash about this movie ever since the first teaser trailer.  Being a long time Punisher fan, and an avid reader of Garth Ennis' current run on the series, I felt deeply betrayed when I found out that the Punisher would only be in his mid-thirties (as opposed to around 50 in the comic) and that the story would take place in Tampa, Florida as opposed to a gritty New York setting.  The Punisher should be the easiest comic book adaptation ever.  He's a vigilante with no superpowers who takes out organized crime.  It's so simple it's stupid.  If masterpieces like Spider-Man and X-Men could be faithfully portrayed on the big screen, then Punisher should be a cake walk.  I was sure that it would be terrible and the critic reviews supported this theory.  Well, I wouldn't ever be satisified unless I saw it, so about a week before it left the theater, I sat in an empty screenroom around noon on a wednesday and saw The Punisher.<br /><br />Well, despite the changes, I really liked the film.  Liked it enough to buy it, even.  It's not without it's faults, but it was far better than the previous Dolph Lundren version and a whole lot better than Daredevil which I proclaim a worse movie than Gigli.  I liked Castle's heavy drinking and often depressed state of being.  I liked how he didn't just kill Saint...he turned everyone he trusted against him...then killed him.  I liked the references to the Garth Ennis series (Joan, Dave, and Bumpo were characters created by Ennis in the comic).  Even some of the scenes from the original Ennis limited series were added; such as the fight with Russian, the spring-loaded knife, and Dave getting his piercings pulled out.  And the popsicle-torture scene was taken from an issue from the early-eighties.  I loved it.<br /><br />So, yeah, I would have liked it if Castle was a Vietnam vet in his fifties.  I would have preferred that he hunted down organized crime lords in New York instead of Florida.  But I still had fun with this.  The lesson learned here is: I had preconceived ideas about this movie, and I had listened to all the critics and stayed away from it intitially....but I ended up really liking it.  So my advise to you is to not make up your mind about something until you see it; and don't listen to what the critics say.  Really....who cares what they think.  They get paid the same whether they like it or not.</p></body></html>

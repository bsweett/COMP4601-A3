<meta name="summary" content="charming, low-keyed fantasy"></head><body><p>"Bridge to Terabithia" is that rare movie about enchantment that really is enchanting.  Based on the novel by Katherine Paterson, this is like a more kid-friendly version of "Pan's Labyrinth," in that both films deal with unhappy children who retreat into a fully realized world of fantasy - the difference being that, in this case at least, it is a world seemingly of their own making.<br /><br />Jesse Aarons, a local farm boy, is a regular target of bullies at school, while Leslie Burke is the new kid in town, never an easy thing to be when you're an underclassman in a school full of obnoxious, belligerent eighth graders who don`t mind showing you who`s boss every time you walk down the hallway or dare to use the lavatory.  The two new friends obviously need a place to get away from their troubles, so in the forest nearby, they create the imaginary kingdom of Terabithia, filled with wondrous creatures and non-threatening ogres, that becomes increasingly actualized as the story goes on.<br /><br />"Bridge to Terabithia" succeeds by  keeping it uncluttered and simple and by focusing more on the daily lives of Jesse and Leslie than on their adventures in the forest.  Fantasy, the film seems to be saying, is for those special times when reality gets to be just a bit too much to handle, but that the real, everyday world is the place we all must inhabit for most of our time here on earth.  The movie is all in favor of childhood imagination, but not at the expense of real world experiences and relationships.<br /><br />The tricky premise  is brought to charming cinematic life by writers Jeff Stockwell and David Paterson, director Gabor Csupo, and the special effects experts who understand that less is often more when it comes to making the fantastical real and believable on screen.  But primary credit goes to the utterly winning performances by Josh Hutcherson, Anna Sophia Robb, and six-year old Bailee Madison, who, as Jesse's adorable kid sister, reminds one of Drew Barrymore in her early "E.T." days.  All three do a lovely job embodying the youthful exuberance and openhearted wonder that are so much a part of the movie's vision and theme.<br /><br />Parents should note that, while the movie may be too emotionally wrenching for very young children (there`s an unusually stark plot development towards the end of the film), it is ideal viewing for slightly older kids and younger teens.  It's great fun, too, for adults not yet too jaded and cynical to tap into the dream.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Typical Hollywood Dilution To Drivel..."></head><body><p>First off, I LIKE Keanu Reeves movies. (Especially Constantine). And I really looked forward to this dvd. Keanu as Klaatu The Alien holding the power to wipe out mankind? Cool. I wanted to see what he would bring to the Michael Rennie's original character. So after 80 minutes or so, figuring they were taking their time to develop the characters, and NOW I was going to see the frantic saving of mankind, and...BOOM...the movie's over! What????? From a plot crisis point to credits in like 15 seconds!!!!!!<br /><br />(Spoiler): Since when do the tears of one mucho attitude child (Jaden Smith) divert the mission of an alien sent to cleanse the Earth of its human plague? And then Keanu just disappears without a goodbye or kiss my alien butt? PUHLEASE!<br /><br />(Spoiler): And where the hell did Gort-the robot go off to? The coolest part of the ORIGINAL was the interaction of Gort and Patricia Neal saving Klaatu. AND in the original, Klaatu really has no power at all. He is there as an observer. It is Gort, the robot, who is the sheriff of the galaxy, created by Klaatu's race.<br /><br />(Spoiler): And with the wrath of Gort unleashed upon the hapless Earth in the form of METAL HOUSEFLIES (supposed to be a reference to the biblical plague of locusts????) we get only an 18-wheeler eaten up, as well as a road sign, and a swirling cloud infringing on a city. Where was the rampant destruction that would teach the upstart humans a lesson? I felt cheated that whole cities weren't wiped out.<br /><br />Best characters in the film? David Wong as Mr. Wu. Wu is an alien planted on our world 50 years prior, to observe and sum up our species. I just like David Wong, ever since Big Trouble In Little China. AND, Kathy Bates did her part. She played her character well enough to irritate the living hell out of me with her `politico-military' tunnel vision. Jennifer Connolly was totally miscast as the astro-biologist who tries to hide Klaatu. In fact, the script didn't give her one line of scientific reference (or background), so she come off as some woman who happens to wear a white lab coat. More time wsa spent on showing her switch truth serum for saline than developing her character.<br /><br />And the script? A Scooby-Do movie has better dialogue when it comes to asking the important questions! There was no penetrating discussion between Reeves and John Cleese (who plays Jennifer Connolly's mentor). The best moment between the two is their jointly reworking a blackboard formula (a scene designed to show their simpatico). Meeting Cleese would have been the perfect scene to show us more about Klaatu's civilization, and Gort' background. SOME was disclosed, but the opportunity to reveal was missed.<br /><br />I am going to watch this movie again, just to make sure I didn't miss the `dazzling' special FX the film touted. I can do the same light-sourcing on my laptop, and there was nothing `dazzling' about the miniatures and CG.<br /><br />Unless you are a Keanu fan, like myself, I really have to tell you not to bother. You may end up screaming "the original 1951 version was WAY better!" at the screen. Remakes aren't supposed to copy the originals. They are supposed to add something and give more/different perspective. This script DEDUCTED frm the original. I am sure the actors already know they were sabotaged by a horrible script....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Four for Seven"></head><body><p>A very good movie in that it pulls you in and keeps you watching; however, it is ultimately flawed in the same way as was the similar (and far inferior) 'Bone Collector' -- The psycho killer's plans absolutely hinge on the timely discovery and proper interpretation of the quite obscure "clues" he leaves behind for the detectives. The storyline fails on this point because at the beginning we are told that Sommerset (Freeman) is to retire in a few days. That he was really the only detective who could have possibly both discovered and deciphered the meaning of said "clues" left me wondering how the psycho could have banked on him -- or any one of the much lesser detectives -- to have done the job he needed them to do. Also, by the storyline itself we are told that the psycho set his plan in motion at least a year before Brad Pitt's character ever showed up on the scene, and he thus could not have known that Pitt was going to transfer in from upstate. Yet, his ultimate plan was intimately intertwined with Pitt. Huh??? I recommend Fincher's superior "Zodiac" for a real psycho-killer plot without any holes, since it is based upon actual events. (I also recommend my favorite Fincher film, "The Game" -- totally incredible and cool!).</p></body></html>

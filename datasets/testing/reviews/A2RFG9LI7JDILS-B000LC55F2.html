<meta name="summary" content="excellent display of illusion"></head><body><p>this along with the illusionist became one of the great spectacles of 2006-2007.. Featuring a great cast Caine, Jackman, bowie, and bale.. and a great screenplay.. prestige is a nearly seemless look at trickery and deception that leaves you guessing to the end.. a delightful film to watch and one that will make you interested in learning your history too.. this was one of the better films of the year..</p></body></html>

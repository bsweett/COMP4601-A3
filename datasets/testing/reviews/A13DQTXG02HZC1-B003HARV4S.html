It's a rather accomplished movie that would have you guessed from beginning till the end. Rather than divulging the plot that would compromise the enjoyment of this film, suffice to say that the setting is in yesteryear's Vienna, childhood friends got reunited & rekindles their relationship which perhaps, blossoming into love, revolution is in the air with the Prince plotting to topple the Emperor, a Police Inspector that's sniffing around for Eisenheim's blood to please the Prince so as to be promoted to Chief Inspector & along the way, he struggles with his conscience if it's the right thing to do. Everything would come together in the end and viewers, I'm sure would be taken aback by twist that awaits them.  It's for you to find out if what we see is illusion or it's for real.  Overall, a very accomplished and slick production under direction of Neil Burger.  Scores from Philip Glass does give the movie the mood of the time.  Outstanding performances from the ever-versatile Edward Norton, Paul Giammati (is there anything else this actor won't do?), Jessica Biel (looks very much like Scarlett Johanssen as in The Prestige), and Rufus Sewell.  You won't be disappointed and highly recommended.</p></body></html>

Why? Not necessarily because the film was good - it was very decent. But because in choosing to do this project, he went 'full circle', doing the same thing when he first *lost* the role of Secret Agent 007 back in 1986.<br /><br />During that tumultuous period in the mid-1980s, Brosnan was tied to a television contract. Despite the fact that he had lobbied hard and was the Broccolis' first choice to play Bond, legal issues brought by the production company and NBC eventually led to them to choose another performer over him. To say he was angry would be monumentally understated. He was pissed. And he made no attempt to quietly accept the decision.<br /><br />He was so frustrated with MTM and the producers of the hit tv show that he eventually executed two overt actions to make his position clear.<br /><br />First, he signed with Coca-Cola to do a special project: A nationally broadcasted commercial. In it, he played an unnamed sharply-dressed secret agent-type who deftly dispatches a bunch of ninjas via spectacular, yet casual, maneuvered expertise - ending with him seated next to a beautiful babe. Basically: A sharpened stick publicly poked into the collective eye of everyone who prevented him from getting the role he so desperately wanted.<br /><br />Seeing is believing. So if you doubt the history as I described it - search the terms "Brosnan + Diet Coke" on YouTube. You can see for yourself the 1987 commercial spot, which I personally find hilarious given the context of its creation. :-D<br /><br />Then secondly, immediately after completing his tv contract, he took on his very first film project post 'Remington Steele'. And what was that? Playing a handsome cold-blooded secret agent in '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C88LH">The Fourth Protocol</a>'. (an all-time favorite) Which was released almost exactly at the same time as the first new Bond movie, '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W9CB">The Living Daylights</a>', the very film that would've been his had it not been snatched from his grasp. I have nothing ill to say about Timothy Dalton, whom I found very serviceable in the role. But oh, what fun we would of had Brosnan gotten those two earlier films.<br /><br />Anyway, Pierce made his point. It would be another ten long years, but he would again be up for the role of The Man With A License To Kill. There wasn't dispute or delay that time. And over the next seven years, he executed a fantastic rendition of 007 across four films in the franchise.<br /><br />And now comes this movie - 'Matador' - which translates to 'The Killer' in Spanish. One of his first projects immediately after his resignation from Double O status. In the film, it tells the story about a cold-blooded assassin who finds himself burnt out with the business of contract killing, pointlessly fornicating women, and drinking to drown away his lonliness. He wants to retire.<br /><br />Loved it! Full circle. The man is Zen personified.<br /><br />I enjoyed this much more than I would've expected, not only because I kept snickering at Brosnan's cleverness. But because I kept anticipating the ubiquitous must-have modern twist. Having identified with the regular guy played by Greg Kinnear, the last thing I wanted was to see myself getting screwed over. So the tension built, not unlike waiting for your arm to get punched by a buddy. That's what made this so exciting. Why? Because there wasn't a twist. The story played perfectly straight - so my appreciation for his character of the professional assassin, Julian Noble, exploded into deep relief and respectful admiration.<br /><br />After so many seemingly mandatory bleep-you endings, my thinking was there just *has* to be some kind of weird and terribly messy final&eacute;. I was shocked that this played out completely straight. Pleasantly so.<br /><br />An old school Action/Comedy = Excellence.<br /><br />Definitely enjoyable as a one-time rental.</p></body></html>

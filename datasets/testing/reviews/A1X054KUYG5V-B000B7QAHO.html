<meta name="summary" content="Burton and Dahl are quite compatible"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />This fusion of two subtly-sadistic auteurs in director Tim Burton and children's novelist Roald Dahl makes for a much better film than I expected when I saw the trailers back in 2005; I don't think it's as good as Gene Wilder's version, but it hits enough different notes that it can be treated as a separate film rather than a remake, and a good film at that.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

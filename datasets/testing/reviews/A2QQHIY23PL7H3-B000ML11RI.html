If a depressing, violent world with ambigious heroes and crime and corruption isn't your thing, you'll definitely like it even less with Sin City's stylized visuals and heightened gore, sexuality, and skewed morality. For everyone else though, this is definitely one of the more memorable films in recent years, and turns the genre of comic book adaptations into an artform. An all-star ensemble cast is directed by Robert Rodriguez (with Quentin Tarantino!) against a green screen studio set, bringing to life Frank Miller's acclaimed graphic novel series. It's a fantastic mix of the technical and creative, and leaves you wanting more after the film's finished.<br /><br />The recut, extended, unrated, etc. etc. dvd collectors edition is both good and bad. The bad is that recut and extended doesn't really amount to much, and you'll definitely feel cheated if you go in expecting a radically different film (though you can watch all the stories individually now). The good is that like the other Rodriguez dvds, this one's loaded with great bonus features. You know, the kind that's informative, fun to watch, and isn't promotional fluff. Plus the package comes with a digest sized version of "The Hard Goodbye" so you can compare the film to the source material. A great value.<br /><br />Those who enjoy Sin City (and you can pretty much tell right away from the title if it's your kinda flick) will love this dvd set. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

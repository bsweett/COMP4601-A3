<meta name="summary" content="never read the book, nor saw the first version - awesome"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies where random elements came together to make the movie special. What I mean is: it turned out better than most had expected. There is a lot left to the imagination in such a way that you are not disappointed but actually surprised at it's appeal because you end up filling in the gaps by yourself in a way that is the most entertaining to you. Maybe it's just me, but the Bourne Identity is my favorite movie of 2002.<p>With that said, you won't be disappointed any way it's sliced. It's a spy movie with a ruthless plot and realistic motives that are actually kinda chilling. Nice production value and killer acting. punya. enjoy, don't miss, buy because everything else coming out right now is l-a-m-e (01/03). On a side note, I saw the 80's version and it's pretty dated.</p></body></html>

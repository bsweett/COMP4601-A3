<meta name="summary" content="A Superb Film that romanticizes a would-be mass murderer!"></head><body><p>Oh man,do I hate reviews like this!<br /><br />THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is one tremendously engaging film about the early life and travels of who was eventually to become "Che" Guevara, notorious revolutionary and mass murderer.Guevara and and his best bud Alberto Granado set out on an old motorcycle to travel the South American continent.The story is funny,exhilarating and rather sentimental to the point of winning one over to love and embrace the youth that Guevara was, and to not acknowledge the monster that he became.You will be lulled with gorgeous cinematography of Argentina,Peru,Chile,Colombia and Venezuela; you will meet the oppressed and disenfranchised of the Latin Americas;you will see events that formed a young man's ideals.....or will you? This film is excellent....but I caution you to not accept the information presented here as gospel.If you don't watch out, you will think that Guevara ends up a true champion of the people who loved lepers as much as he loved the freedom of all people.NOT SO! If anything this movie leaves you with, it will be the single thought,"What went wrong?" that this simplistic youth could end up like Hitler or Manson.5 stars for an engrossing film,but only with the understanding that what you see is romanticized fiction at best.</p></body></html>

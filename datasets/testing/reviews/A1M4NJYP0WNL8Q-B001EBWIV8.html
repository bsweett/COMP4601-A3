It's a flaw that occurs when I like something, but not quite enough to wait in lines at theaters or reserve copies at a rental store when I'm never quite sure of my schedule.  The Matrix falls into that category, very well done and imaginative, no doubt, but it didn't stir me enough to rush to see the sequels.<br /><br />Now I've seen Reloaded, and I continue to be impressed, not so much by the raw imagination of Matrix, but by it's ability to skirt the obvious paradigms that the viewer expects and hare off instead in entirely new directions.  Of course, the wild chases and fight scenes are here in all their glory.  At a certain point, they actually become abstract and tedious extravaganzas.  The Wachowski's put everything they can into Neo's acrobatics, coming closer and closer to a bloodbath that never actually happens.  Unfortunately this means stretching them out until they cry for editing.<br /><br />In spite of all this showmanship, it is the plot and characters that really make this film.  Neo struggles to discover what he needs to do Morpheus seeks after the Oracle, and a whirl of voice enhance characters sweep across the screen like Dune revisited.  New characters like Merovingian and Persephone liven things up.  And Agent Smith turns into a cast of thousands all by himself.<br /><br />Doom is descending to destroy Zion, and Neo must decide what is important, what is real, what is maze, and what is purpose.  Zion itself comes to life beautifully, and we finally get an understanding of how this culture of rebels really works.  My only irritation is that the film ends in a total cliffhanger, which somehow smacks of cheating.  I mean, I would have gotten to Matrix Revolutions sooner or later anyway.</p></body></html>

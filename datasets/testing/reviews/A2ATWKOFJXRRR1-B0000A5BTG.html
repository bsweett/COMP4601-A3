<meta name="summary" content="Usual Over-Hype; Some Good Dialogue"></head><body><p>I've watched every big budget SciFi/Fantasy/Horror film that has come out since 1983. And although some have pleased me greatly (Lord of the Rings, The Ring, etc.), I have to say that The Core fell pretty flat.<br /><br />One of my favorite genre-related films of late was K-Pax, starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Why? Because the CHARACTERS were paramount to the story, not any form of technology or science.<br /><br />Here, in The Core, we have a bit of a mixture but most of the emphasis was placed on the science needed to get the characters TO the center of the earth. At least that's the way I saw it. The ship design, the lasers, crush depth pressures, etc. got a bit too much screen time for my liking. I would've liked to have learned more about these people, their lives, their families, why they're willing to risk everything and try and save the planet. We never really find this out (with the one exception being the butthead scientific advisor to the Pentagon who does it all for fame and fortune...in the beginning). So when several of them begin to die off in gruesome fashions, the emotional impact is negligible on the viewer.<br /><br />Hollywood? Are you listening? Look back to the days of old! The Day the Earth Stood Still, for example. It's always GOT TO BE the characters that pull the story along; not the science.<br /><br />Some might say that I'm anti-science. But I'm not. For science fiction films, that element has to be in there in some way (usually).<br /><br />I will commend whoever wrote the dialogue. It wasn't forced and had some zing! to it:<br /><br />Example, "What will it take to make your ship in three months, Doctor?"<br /><br />"Oh about 15 billion dollars."<br /><br />"Will you take a check?"<br /><br />&lt;other charcter chimes in with> "I thought you'd go with a credit card for the frequent flyer miles."<br /><br />Good and bad aspects in the film. Will I be watching it again? Most likely not.</p></body></html>

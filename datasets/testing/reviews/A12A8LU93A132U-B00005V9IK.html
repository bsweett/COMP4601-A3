<meta name="summary" content="A DVD review"></head><body><p>This set of DVD's is good but not great as two disc sets go. The three documentaries are good; however, they have a great deal of shared material, so overall you get maybe an hour of new information. The commentary by the director and producer was interesting. Information like the US military did not support the film because Area 51 was mentioned, makes you wonder. Most of the added minutes in the special edition are just extended scenes already in the movie. In some cases this enhances the characters but not by much. Most interesting was the changed ending. I liked the never-seen ending better. The reason it was changed was apparently for believability, but the whole movie was not believable. The picture galleries aren't that good and very short. The special effects commentary could have been better. Most of the interesting information on the special effects was covered very well by the documentaries. Most of the special effects commentary is reduced to the commentators saying, "That's a model," and "That's CGI." Overall, a DVD I have in my collection because I love sci-fi and not for the features, effects or story for that matter.</p></body></html>
